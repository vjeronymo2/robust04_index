For a little over a year since he assumed power  as the president, the traitor Kim Yong-sam has persistently  adhered to antireunification maneuvers, thus showing his ugly  shape as a matchless national traitor and a most vicious  separatist.    Traitor Kim Yong-sam was exposed to have constantly waged  anti-Republic confrontation commotions and provocative northward  nuclear war exercises together with outside forces ever since he  came into office. Thus, he has aggravated North-South  relations. Besides, he blocked [chadan] all dialogue and  exchanges between the North and the South and laid more grave  obstacles on the road of reunification. In fact, this is an  exorbitant unpardonable crime even greater than all of the  separatist maneuvers committed by former South Korean dictators  throughout the period of their political power.    Just as the South Korean people have branded, the Kim  Yong-sam puppet regime is the most vicious antireunification  separatist regime of all the successive regimes in South Korea.  It is the treacherous enemy of North-South dialogue and  peaceful reunification. This is proven by the fact that the  rascals have totally blocked North-South dialogue which was held  even during the previous periods of military dictatorship.    Last year, we put forward the 10-point program of great  unity  of the whole country for national reunification, out of a desire  to seek national reconciliation and unity and to expedite  reunification in the nineties. We also put forward before the  South Korean authorities, the issue on exchanging special envoys  of top-level authorities between the two sides in order to  discuss and solve pending problems, including the nuclear issue.    People from all walks of life in South Korea said that only  if the people follow the 10-point program, will the peaceful  reunification which 70 million fellow countrymen ardently aspire  after, be achieved. They expressed a firm determination to rise  more vigorously in the reunification movement.    However, traitor Kim Yong-sam, even after personally  receiving our 10-point program for great unity of the whole  country, rejected the magnanimous proposal of fellow countrymen  for reconciliation and unity, and advanced the road toward  confrontation and division against fellow countrymen. The Kim  Yong-sam group totally froze North-South high-level talks and  obstructed the exchange of special envoys between the two sides.  Moreover, it confiscated letters we sent to South Korean  authorities, representatives of political parties and public  organizations, and figures from all walks of life in order to  appeal for achieving reunification in the nineties with the  united strength of the nation. By not even delivering the  letters, the Kim Yong-sam group acted rashly.    In a news conference marking the 100th day of his  inauguration, the puppet traitor said that he cannot shake hands  with a partner who has nuclear weapons, and in talks between  heads of ruling and opposition parties, he raved that unless the  nuclear problem is resolved, he cannot hold a summit. During  the early stages of his power, the puppet traitor also made  remarks on discussing the reunification issue, and improving  relations with the North from the standpoint of being of one  people, as though he were going to bring about a change of  policy on North-South relations. However, all of his remarks  were merely cunning, deceitful tactics designed to mislead  public opinion at home and abroad.    The Kim Yong-sam group viciously blocked not only dialogue  between the authorities in the North and the South but also  multilateral contacts between the North and the South, as well  as reunification dialogue between peoples from all walks of life.    Claiming that regardless of form, North-South contacts  unapproved by the administration, cannot be tolerated, the  puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam mercilessly oppressed youth,  students and people from all walks of life who aspired to  contact and hold dialogue with the North for reunification  through collaboration with communists and with the North.    As a result, last year's 12 June Panmunjom talks between  youth and students from the North and the South, the fourth  Seoul congress of the pannational meeting for national  reunification, a soccer game between students from Pyongyang and  Seoul, a bicycle race by students of the North and the South,  and all other just advances of exchanges with South Korean  youth, students, and people for national reconciliation, unity,  and reunification, were suppressed and blocked. The puppet  traitors blocked us from conveying our condolences for the late  Rev. Mun Ik-hwan in Seoul, and our plan to hold a working-level  contact between Chondoist delegations from the North and the  South at Panmunjom in order to jointly commemorate the 100th  anniversary of the Kabo farmers' war. They blocked the  condolence call by fellow countrymen and infringed upon the  patriotic intention of the Chondoists of the North and the  South. This is an act that can be committed only by such  matchlessly wicked traitors and the most atrocious fascist  tyrants as that of the Kim Yong-sam clique.    Traitor Kim Yong-sam's antireunification color was  eloquently  illustrated in his theory on the uselessness of reunification  which claimed that unless free democracy and market economy are  guaranteed, reunification is worse than division. His  antireunification nature was also clearly shown in his so-called  three-stage reunification plan which assumes reunification of  the system [chedo tongil], which may evoke confrontation and war  between fellow countrymen, as a precondition for national  reunification.    Many South Korean people unanimously criticized traitor Kim  Yong-sam's three-stage reunification plan as keeping intact the  main point of the Korean people's commonwealth national  reunification plan. In his New Year address and in the New Year  press conference early this year, rascal Kim Yong-sam made no  mention of reunification, and merely made provocative remarks  slandering fellow countrymen. This suggests that traitor Kim  Yong-sam will continually aggravate North-South relations this  year, too, and will deny reunification. This also shows once  again traitor Kim Yong-sam's true color as an antireunification  element.    All successive puppets in South Korea repeatedly committed  maneuvers for national division. However, no group was as  wicked and cunning as separatist maniacs as the Kim Yong-sam  clique.    Today, when all fellow countrymen unanimously rise as one in  the patriotic reunification movement in order to make 1995 the  first year for national reunification, the Kim Yong-sam group  wields a bayonet against the people calling for national  reconciliation and unity and totally froze North-South dialogue  which existed even in times of military dictatorship. The  crimes of the Kim Yong-sam group can never be pardoned. Neither  North-South dialogue nor peaceful reunification of the nation  can be achieved as long as the Kim Yong-sam clique remains  intact.    The Kim Yong-sam antireunification regime must immediately  be  overthrown so as to achieve independent and peaceful  reunification of the nation, which all fellow countrymen aspire  after. It is natural for the South Korean people to rise in the  antigovernment struggle by shouting slogans, "Let us give a hard  blow to the Kim Yong-sam separatist regime!" and "Let us cut the  neck of the Kim Yong-sam clique, the enemy of reunification!"    The puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam, the enemy of dialogue and  reunification, cannot avoid a hard blow by the nation.</p>

The battle around Gornji Vakuf, a town in south-west Hercegovina near the Adriatic, appears to have been provoked by the Geneva peace process itself, particularly the map tabled by the international mediators, Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen. Bosnian Croatian forces have attempted to consolidate their positions in areas designated as Croat-controlled on the map which divides the proposed future Bosnian state into 10 semi-autonomous provinces.</p>

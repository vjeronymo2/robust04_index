			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / Abbey National to charge fees on all current accounts THE END of free banking for current account customers who remain in credit was signalled yesterday when Abbey National said it intended to introduce charges for current account customers within a few months. Abbey National, with 1.2m current account customers, said it could not afford the Pounds 45m annual cost without some charges for accounts in credit. The bank said it had not yet decided on a charging structure. Mr John Fry, Abbey National's group services director, said it was not afraid to be the first bank to re-introduce charges on current accounts in credit. Charges were abolished by Midland Bank in 1984, shortly followed by the other banks. 'We would rather be first after listening to what charges our customers would prefer, than to be dragged along on the coat-tails of other banks,' said Mr Fry. Abbey National's move is likely to be followed eventually by other banks, most of whom have said they regard 'free' banking as unsustainable. But its competitors said yesterday they had no immediate plans to follow the Abbey National initiative. Mr Fry said he believed Abbey National would introduce current account charges by the end of the year, but did not specify their form. The bank, formerly a building society, ruled out charging for each customer transaction. Abbey National said a survey carried out on behalf of the bank found customers were more worried about the location of branches, and prompt cheque clearance, than being offered all transactions without charge. It said 88 per cent thought fees for 'core' services such as providing cheque books, cards and statements were unfair, but fees for 'additional' services such as stopping cheques were fair. Abbey National said it was taking seriously a recent study by Mr David Llewellyn, Loughborough University professor of banking, which recommended a flat rate quarterly fee plus some discretionary charges. Barclays, National Westminster and Midland said they had no current plans to re-introduce account charges for customers in credit. Banks count the cost, Page 9</p>

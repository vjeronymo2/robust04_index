			<p><P> January 15, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DEMOCRAT LEADER VIEWS OPPOSITION  </P> <P> So, Mr. Thomas A. Fuentes says we Orange County Democrats are "sad and  ineffective" (Jan. 10). We certainly are not sad, and we are always trying to  become more effective. What is sad, however, is the arrogance of the Orange  County Republican leadership.  </P> <P> Fuentes and the rest of that leadership did a very bad thing by hiring guards  to discourage Hispanics from voting. That act has been condemned by people of  conscience in both parties. Only the Republican leadership of Orange County has  failed to condemn it. And now, by the reelection of Fuentes as their chairman,  they have ratified and approved this wrong and unconstitutional act.  </P> <P> The Orange County Democratic Party opens its doors to Republicans, Hispanics,  and others, who are disgusted by the Orange County Republican leadership's  disrespect for our constitutional freedoms.  </P> <P> MIKE BALMAGES  </P> <P> Chair, Orange County Democratic  </P> <P> Central Committee  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 12, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MATTINGLY IS ACTIVATED BY YANKEES  </P> <P> Don Mattingly, sidelined since July 25 because of a stiff lower back, was  activated by the New York Yankees Tuesday.  </P> <P> Mattingly is hitting .245 this season in 343 at-bats with five home runs and 35  runs batted in.  </P> <P> He has not hit a home run since May 20. Mattingly's last appearance was July 24  at Texas. He was placed on the 21-day disabled list the next day.  </P> <P> "I was sure I would be back -- that was never a question," Mattingly said  before Tuesday night's game against the Rangers. "In fact, I thought I would be  back before this, but it took more time than I expected to come around. "I have  no goals. I'm not looking to do anything offensively or defensively very  special. All I want to do is play and stay healthy and not experience any more  pain."  </P> <P> Mattingly did not play in the Yankees' 5-4 victory Tuesday.  </P></p>

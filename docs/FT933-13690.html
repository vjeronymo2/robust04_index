			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / PSBR rises sharply despite higher government receipts UK GOVERNMENT borrowing in the first three months of the financial year rose by nearly a quarter on the corresponding period of 1992-93, according to Treasury figures published yesterday. The deterioration came in spite of higher-than-expected government receipts last month caused largely by individuals and companies paying their tax bills early. The public sector borrowing requirement in April-June was Pounds 13.2bn, compared with Pounds 10.7bn in the same period a year earlier. Government borrowing in June came to Pounds 3.88bn, nearly Pounds 1.5bn less than forecasts by City economists. The increased flow of cash into the Treasury from tax payments only partly compensated for a big rise in government spending, caused by higher social security payments linked to the recession. The figures provide a warning of the fiscal problems facing the government. They came after a series of favourable statistics earlier this week which showed manufacturing output is picking up, while unemployment is coming down and retail price inflation is at a 30-year low. The Treasury expects the gap between spending and borrowing this financial year to reach Pounds 50bn. It will decide over the next few months whether new tax increases next April are required to bring down the deficit. Last month, central government receipts came to Pounds 15.6bn, 12.6 per cent up on the Pounds 13.9bn recorded in June last year. Receipts from income tax and value added tax were buoyant, partly as a result of payments which would normally be made later in the summer being brought forward to June. Government officials said this might be due to new rules requiring big companies to pay VAT monthly rather than quarterly. Another reason was advance payment of tax the self-employed. In the first three months of this financial year, central government income totalled Pounds 48.4bn, 5.5 per cent up on the Pounds 46bn collected in the equivalent time last year. Over the same period, spending by central government rose 8.5 per cent to Pounds 61.3bn from Pounds 56.4bn. In June, overall borrowing was brought down slightly through the government collecting Pounds 210m in privatisation proceeds. City and academic forecasters expect the 1993-94 PSBR to be Pounds 47.6bn, slightly less than they estimated in June and just under the Treasury projection, according to non-government forecasts issued yesterday by the Treasury.

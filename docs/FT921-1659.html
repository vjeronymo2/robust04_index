			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Three vie for top CPSA job THERE are three candidates in the election for general secretary of the CPSA civil service union. They are Mr John Macreadie, deputy general secretary of the 124,000-strong union, Mr Barry Reamsbottom, standard-bearer for the union's rightwing grouping, and Mr Peter Thomason, who is likely to be supported by the centrist group. Mr Reamsbottom, editor of the union's newspaper, remains the favourite. The election has been prompted by the appointment of Mr John Ellis, general secretary, to a senior post at the Council of Civil Service Unions.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yngve Hellestol and Aslak Bonde: "FAFO: EU </F> Choice Not So Dramatic"]    [Text] According to FAFO [Trade Union Center for Research,  Investigation, and Documentation], the effects of a yes or a no  to EU [European Union] membership are less dramatic than many  people would like to suggest.    The "No to the EU" organization is considering preparing a  counterreport before the LO [Trade Union Confederation]  congress. But first it will take a good look at the FAFO report.    "The EU's importance for the trade union movement is  exaggerated. The gloomy pictures that are painted both if we  remain outside and if we join the EU are incorrect. There is  much confusion in the debate. Many people engage in the  discussion as if the EEA [European Economic Area] does not  exist," FAFO research chief Jon Erik Dolvik said.    Yesterday, alongside researchers Arild H. Steen and Dag  Stokland, he made public the FAFO report on the consequences of  EU membership which the LO secretariat had commissioned. This  EU report will form the foundation for the LO's discussion of  the EU question in the run-up to the extraordinary LO congress  on 22 September. Yesterday LO leader Yngve Hagensen remained  unwilling to signal what is his view of EU membership. The LO  leader contented himself by saying that the LO congress in  September will reach a clear decision for or against.    As far as the trade union movement's working conditions and  trade union rights are concerned, the report concludes that  these will not be undermined in the event of EU membership.    "There are no formal reasons preventing the continuation of  the Nordic model of working life, and Norway will be included in  the same set of rules in both the EEA and the EU," the FAFO  report states.    For the Norwegian economy the effects of EU membership are  more uncertain, in FAFO's view. There is uncertainty about  whether the economic growth resulting from EU membership will be  so high as to meet the increase in spending resulting from  membership. FAFO estimates net spending in the state budget at  6.5 billion, something that would necessitate an increase in  growth in GNP of 0.15 percent per year over a 10-year period.    For industry FAFO takes the view that competition for  private  industry and service companies will largely be the same in the  EEA and the EU. The exception is the food industry. In FAFO's  view, EU membership will give rise to tougher conditions and  reduced employment for agriculture-based industry and  agriculture, while fisheries-based industry on the other hand  could experience more exports.    Per Ostvold and Kjell Iversen, respectively leader and  secretary of "No to the EU," said that Jon Erik Dolvik is  extremely biassed in his presentation of the FAFO report.    "He used most of his time to engage in polemics against the  arguments of the no-organizations. I did not hear him arguing  against a single yes-argument. In addition, he also said a  number of things that were downright wrong -- among other things  he rejected the suggestion that the EU's white book and the  guidelines from the meeting of the EU's finance ministers will  lead to bigger differences in wages," Ostvold said.    Both Ostvold and Iversen stressed that they acquired copies  of the report at the press conference. They could therefore  only speak about the presentation.    "But if the report is as it was presented we cannot rule out  the possibility that `No to the EU' will produce a counterreport  before the LO congress," Iversen said.    The central no-sayers in the LO did not comment on the FAFO  report yesterday. The spontaneous reactions of "No to the EU,"  however, indicate that the report will not be accepted as a  neutral base for debate by the most active no-sayers in the  trade union movement.    The self-confessed yes-sayers who were present at the press  conference yesterday were unable to understand the no-side's  reaction. In the presentation it emerged, for example, that EU  economic union is not suited to the Norwegian economy. The FAFO  people in no way supported the government's claim that EU  membership will give economic growth -- even if they did not say  the opposite. It was also pointed out that fewer people will be  employed in agriculture and the food industry as a result of EU  membership.    These are points that the yes-side does not usually make.</p>

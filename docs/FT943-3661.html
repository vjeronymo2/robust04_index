			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Leading Article: FDP on the ropes Germany's Free Democratic Party, the kingmaker in virtually every coalition since the founding of the federal republic, suffered another pair of devastating electoral defeats at the weekend in east Germany. For six elections in a row, the party has now failed to win the 5 per cent of the vote needed to gain seats in state, federal and European parliaments. In the eastern state of Saxony, the FDP won just 1.8 per cent, compared with 5.3 per cent in 1990. In neighbouring Brandenburg it did only marginally better, with 2.2 per cent, although that was a sharp drop from the 6.6 per cent it won four years ago. The electoral writing would appear to be truly on the wall for the FDP. As far as east German electors are concerned, it seems to have little to offer. Its policies of liberal market economics, deregulation, and free trade, combined with a mistrust of state interference at all levels, and a liberal attitude to immigration and race relations, have failed to find any response from the newly-enfranchised east Germans. One factor is clearly that there is no real middle class to appeal to in the east. But another is the signal failure of the FDP to find policies of relevance. The trouble for the party of Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister, is that it is scarcely better off in west Germany. Most political analysts still expect the FDP to scrape into the Bundestag in the general election in October, but it may well not have enough seats to repeat the present coalition with Chancellor Helmut Kohl, or to form an alternative with the opposition Social Democrats. The most likely outcome would then be a 'grand coalition' of Christian Democrats and Social Democrats, which neither of the big parties really wants, leaving the liberals out in the cold. The FDP has no one to blame but itself for its plight. The party has been too long in power, and shows no inspiration except in its desire to hang on to it. It wants to distance itself from Mr Kohl, but cannot do so for fear of losing what little appeal it still has. Too many years of being all things to all men have taken their toll. The loss of the real voice of liberalism from the German political debate would be severe. But it may take a period in opposition to give that voice back its authority.</p>

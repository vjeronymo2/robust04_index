			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Observer: Building talk The latest upheaval in the building society movement - the proposed merger of the Northern Rock and the North of England, raises a question. Can there be some curious connection between glossy new headquarters and society mergers? The North of England is soon to move from the centre of Sunderland to a new HQ on the edge of Sunderland, at the Doxford business park. Similarly the Universal, one of the smaller societies, in merger talks with the Tynemouth, recently moved to smart new premises in central Newcastle. The Leeds, in swank new premises, was in merger discussions, abandoned last autumn, with the National &amp; Provincial, and the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, soon to be digested by Lloyds Bank, hasn't long been in its glitzy premises on the outskirts of Gloucester. So where does this leave the Newcastle Building Society which is planning to move into its imposing Pounds 10m HQ in the centre of Newcastle? A prime target for the Northern Rock's expansion minded management team? Not so, says Newcastle chief executive Bill Midgley, who likens the phenomenon to football teams building new stands, only to be relegated the following season. 'We have to concentrate our minds on making the profits to pay for our new headquarters.' Fighting talk, Bill.</p>

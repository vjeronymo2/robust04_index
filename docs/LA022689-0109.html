			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> A court in Florence, Italy, convicted seven people, including five organized  crime figures, in a 1984 train bombing that killed 16 Christmas travelers and  wounded more than 200. A panel of judges acquitted two people after ruling  there was insufficient evidence to tie them to the Dec. 23 bombing of an  express train as it passed through a tunnel between Florence and Bologna. Five  of the defendants were sentenced to life in prison, including Giuseppe (Pippo)  Calo, an alleged Sicilian Mafia crime figure. The other two received 25- and  28-year terms. The prosecution alleged that the defendants wanted to use the  bombing to distract authorities investigating organized crime.  </P></p>

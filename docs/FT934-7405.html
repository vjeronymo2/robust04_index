			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / International Company News: Bleak outlook for Japan's top five trading houses THE steep downturn in Japanese business activity and the surge of the yen's value against the world's leading currencies took their toll on the results of the country's five large trading houses in the first half of the year. The trading houses, which depend on the flow of goods and services for a large proportion of their earnings, were directly impacted by the slowdown in activity among Japanese corporations as well as in third country trade. At the same time, a favourable interest rate environment in which interest expenses came down faster than interest income, helped many houses to improve their financial balance. Many trading houses have also liquidated unprofitable subsidiaries and cancelled tokkin, or specified money trusts, and fund trusts in a bid to minimise their losses on these instruments. While the losses were in many cases offset by selling equity holdings or real estate assets, the need to provide for falling asset prices and loan losses as well led some, such as Mitsubishi, to post extraordinary losses. The business slump hurt revenues, in particular from trading activities in machinery, chemicals, energy and textiles. The strength of the yen also had a substantial impact on the overseas earnings of the trading houses, which are active traders in commodities and other markets overseas. Mitsubishi said that the yen's rise had depressed trading transactions by about Y600bn. Uniquely, however, Mitsui was able to benefit from dealing in the domestic market in non-ferrous metals which increased its revenues from domestic activity by 14 per cent. On the positive side, the falling interest rate environment worked in favour of the trading houses, which derive considerable income from interest on trade finance activities, loans made to companies and a range of financial investments but also bear a heavy burden on borrowings made to finance their investments. Marubeni, for example, was able to increase pre-tax profits by 35 per cent even though operating profits more than halved, as a result of a significantly improved non-operating balance. While operating profits were a modest Y6.6bn compared with Y13.5bn last year, Marubeni's non-operating balance amounted to Y14.1bn against Y1.9bn previously, taking pre-tax profits to Y20.6, against Y15.3bn. But the outlook for the houses remains bleak as recovery is not expected until the latter part of next year.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- INTERIM RESULTS 1993-94 (Ybn)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                 Sales       Operating      Pre-tax                                                profit       profit  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ITOCHU                        7,879.4            24.6         18.5   Last year's interim         9,201.4            21.9         22.5   1993-94 year forecast      15,500.0                         30.0  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- MARUBENI                      6,740.5             6.6         20.6   Last year's interim         8,283.9            13.5         15.3   1993-94 year forecast      14,500.0                         38.0  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- MITSUBISHI                    6,918.5            18.5         27.6   Last year's interim         7,502.0            35.3         31.5   1993-94 year forecast      14,000.0                         55.0  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- MITSUI                        7,657.1            13.9         23.5   Last year's interim         7,712.4            24.3         25.1   1993-94 year forecast      15,000.0                         46.0  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SUMITOMO                      7,553.2             7.0         18.0   Last year's interim         8,596.8            13.5         23.2   1993-94 year forecast      15,000.0                         36.0  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Company reports  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["tl"-signed report: "Bonn Trying To Gain Wider Support for </F> EU Enlargement"]    [Text] Bonn -- In Bonn's view, enlargement of the European  Union [EU] will be the focal point of German-British  consultations in Chequers. The controversial British rebate on  payments to the EU budget will, however, not be discussed during  the summit, the Federal Government said.    Bonn is extremely interested in the European Parliament's  approval of EU enlargement by Austria, Sweden, Norway, and  Finland on 4 May. That is why Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel  will be going to Brussels in the evening following talks in  London and Chequers to discuss the matter with German members of  parliament.    In his talks with Prime Minister John Major, Chancellor  Helmut Kohl also wants to address "the consistent moving toward  the EU" of the Central and East European states. This was also  the topic that Kohl put at the center of his working lunch with  Jaques Delors in Bonn yesterday.    Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt will have comprehensive  talks with British Trade and Industry Secretary Michael  Heseltine in London. Rexrodt is planning to visit the European  capitals in the near future in preparation for the German [EU]  presidency in the second half of 1994. London is considered the  first and most important destination; a second visit by Rexrodt  is scheduled for 9 July.    The economics minister is mainly seeking Britain's support  for the deregulation offensive that he wants to make the focus  of the second half of 1994. Competitiveness of European  industry will be the central issue of the London talks.    Rexrodt and Heseltine also want to discuss aviation,  telecommunications, and steel. In the field of aviation, the  so-called future large aircraft, the joint production of a  transport aircraft, will be discussed. Another item on the  agenda is the joint development and production of aeroengines.  This includes a comprehensive harmonization of export controls  for dual use products that has been demanded by German industry.    German-British trade declined last year due to recession  (- 3.9 percent in imports, - 0.3 percent in exports). In  1992, German imports amounted to 43.57 billion German marks  [DM], and exports were DM51.95, while the relevant figures were  DM33.16 billion and DM46.61 billion in 1993. As in previous  years, Germany was Britain's major trading partner in 1993 (14.0  percent of foreign trade). Great Britain is one of the most  important trading partners for the FRG as well (6.9 percent of  foreign trade).    The Finance Ministry said yesterday that the German side  wants to discuss the 1995 EU budget and financial implications  of EU enlargement with British Chancellor of the Exchequer  Kenneth Clarke. Another issue to be discussed is EU-wide  measures against fraud.    Bonn denies that the EU rebate of DM6 billion per year,  which  Great Britain was granted in 1985, will be discussed in the  London talks. Yet, it is not only the coalition parties and the  finance minister, but also the Social Democratic opposition that  wants to reshuffle EU finances in Germany's favor. The rebate  for Great Britain is no longer justified, the Social Democratic  Party's deputy chairwoman Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul said only  recently.</p>

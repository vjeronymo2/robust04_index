			<p><P> September 17, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DANCE REVIEW;  </P> <P> FESTIVAL '90;  </P> <P> 'REVOLUCION' SHOWCASES EAST L.A. TROUPE  </P> <P> Just in time for Mexican Independence Day, the East L.A. Choreographers  Showcase offered a reprise of Carola de la Rocha's ambitious pageant, "La  Revolucion," in the cozy Playhouse at Cal State Los Angeles. Nearly 30 members  of her Los Angeles Mexican Dance Company traced, in dance terms reminiscent of  "The Red Detachment of Women," the transition from aristocracy to people's  republic.  </P> <P> Then, with barely a pause, the fledgling folkloric group performed its take on  a traditional "Danza del Venado," with Alfonso Escalante as the skittish deer  and a brilliantly costumed tableau, "Matachines," choreographed by Rocha and  associate director Victor M. Durazo.  </P> <P> They've come a long way since last year's show on a bare platform at the Casa  del Mexicano. Properly supported by the production crew, the company, whose  founders hail from the Ballet Folklorico de Mexico, displayed the rewards of  diligent application to traditional and original material.  </P> <P> The rest of the evening consisted of nine short dances, three of them by the  concert's producer, Frank Guevara. Ranging from the mawkishly sensuous  "Recuerdo" to the aptly titled "Strictly Commercial," his slick work bracketed  offerings by six other artists. Most of these worked to popular tunes in styles  derived from music and workout videos. Snatches of voguing, street dance  offered by a very young ensemble under the direction of Domino Fernandez and  Louis J. Vela's production number rounded out a remarkably diverse program.

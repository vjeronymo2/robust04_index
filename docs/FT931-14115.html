			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / BAe and Taiwan in regional jet deal BRITISH Aerospace and Taiwan Aerospace Corporation (TAC) yesterday agreed after months of intense negotiations to establish a joint venture for the production of regional jet aircraft. BAe hopes the move will stem losses by transferring some final assembly work to Taiwan, where labour costs are lower. The regional jet division incurred an operating loss of Pounds 167m in the first half of 1992. TAC will pay Pounds 120m to BAe in three three-monthly instalments for its half share in a new company, Avro International Aerospace. Another Dollars 25m will be paid when the first of BAe's RJ range of regional jets is built in Taiwan, during 1994. BAe will use the cash to reduce group borrowings. Net debt at June 1992 was Pounds 987m. 'This allows us to stay in civil aviation,' said Mr John Cahill, chairman of British Aerospace. He said no further jobs would be cut in regional jet manufacturing. A Pounds 750m provision for the second half of 1992 should be 'sufficient to cover the costs of reorganisation', said BAe. Completion of the deal is still subject to regulatory approval. Initially, one-third of final assembly of RJs will take place in Taichung, Taiwan, but this proportion would increase with rising sales of BAe's RJ range of aircraft, said BAe. The sales effort will be concentrated in the fast-growing Asia-Pacific region, although Taiwanese-made aircraft could be sold anywhere in the world, said Mr Cahill. Avro's six-man board will have equal representation from both companies. Its chairman is Mr Mike Turner, currently chairman of the regional aircraft division and its chief executive, yet to be appointed, will be Taiwanese. TAC is 29 per cent-owned by the Taiwanese government and the rest by local companies. It was founded in 1991 to develop the island's fledgling aerospace industry. It failed in November 1991 to clinch a Dollars 2bn deal to take a stake in the commercial aircraft division of US aerospace company McDonnell-Douglas. The RJ family of aircraft was launched in summer of 1992 as a successor to the BAe-146. Avro will also provide support to about 200 BAe-146s which have been delivered to date.

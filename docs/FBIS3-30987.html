			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Croatian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign </F> Minister Mate Granic by Dragoslav Kosaric; place and date not  given -- recorded]    [Text] [Kosaric] Mr. Granic, what do you concretely  expect from the talks with [FRY--Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]  Deputy Prime Minister Simic in Zagreb [on 12 February]?    [Granic] We will discuss three groups of questions. First,  the functioning of the Bureau of the Republic of Croatia in  Belgrade, that is to say, of the FRY Bureau in Zagreb, and all  the details connected to it. According to the information from  both sides so far, they will be opened on time.    The other group of questions will comprise of humanitarian  issues. The search for missing persons, the problem of  refugees, and such like. I believe that the interest here is  almost identical, completely identical on several of these  issues, and that both sides must invest all efforts to [words  indistinct] be resolved as soon as possible. We will also  discuss these questions at the meeting of the two delegations.  At the same time, as you know, we have formed a joint  commission in the presence of the UN High Commissioner for  Refugees [UNHCR] and the International Red Cross Committee.    The third group of questions are political, interstate  issues. Some important technical questions regarding the opening  of communications will definitely be included in these political  issues, but also fundamental questions of the normalization of  Serbian-Croatian relations.    [Kosaric] Dr. Zvonimir Markovic, chief of the future  Croatian Bureau in Belgrade, recently spoke of five phases of  the implementation of the Geneva declaration. How do you see  the declaration within the context of Belgrade-Zagreb relations?    [Granic] It is perfectly obvious that not everything can be  resolved with one or two meetings. The problems are too  profound, and precisely for this reason it pays to be highly  rational and serious in our approach to the resolution of  problems. I believe that the opinion to resolve problems in  phases is absolutely correct. For this reason, we have  initiated the idea about certain degrees of priority and  possibilities for resolution today. However, we will definitely  raise all the essential political questions tomorrow.    [Kosaric] The Serbian side has insisted on direct  Zagreb-Knin talks regarding the problem of the territories  controlled by the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] from the very  beginning. What is your view, that is, the view of the Republic  of Croatia, toward this issue within the framework of the  general normalization of relations?    [Granic] Well, Croatia accepts direct negotiations. We are  compelled to this by UN Security Council Resolution 871.  However, it is equally perfectly obvious that we must first  accomplish a total cease-fire, the end of all hostilities, then  restore communications, and afterward directly resolve all  political issues.    I would like to reiterate that it is beyond any doubt that  the stance that FRY will assume toward these regions will be  very important. This is the key issue. The UN Security Council  resolution also speaks of this. What is more important, the  progress in our talks is possible only if we define these  matters well, too.    [Kosaric] Tell me, what essential issues for Croatia should  be examined as soon as possible?    [Granic] Regarding Croatia, as I have emphasized, it is  important, first of all, that Belgrade's influence on the UN  Protected Areas [UNPAs] be constructive. We understand that the  resolution of the entire issue of UNPA zones is a process. I  believe that we have reached a consensus on an all-encompassing  cease-fire and the establishment of communications. However,  afterward, Croatia will propose a concrete plan. What we expect  from Belgrade is to find the final political solution for the  UNPA zones as a part of the Republic of Croatia, according to  all UN Security Council resolutions passed so far and,  naturally, with all international guarantees. However,  Belgrade's stance at any moment is the most important.    If Belgrade's stance regarding this is clear, then it is  perfectly clear that Belgrade can expect similarly important  political moves from us. We are ready for them.    [Kosaric] Will this year be crucial for overall  Serbian-Croatian relations, in your view?    [Granic] I believe that this year will be very significant.  We have stated very openly that for us it is imperative to  resolve the fundamental question -- an end to clashes with the  Muslims and the permanent regulation of relations. However,  [word indistinct] of the relations in this part of Europe are  the Serbian-Croatian relations. For the stability of the entire  region, Serbian-Croatian relations are of the greatest  importance. The permanent normalization of the Croatian-Serbian  relations is practically a precondition for peace and stability  in this part of Europe. This was also included in the CSCE  documents and we firmly stand on this position. Naturally, we  would like to see the permanent normalization of relations and,  of course, permanent stability, and both counties will profit  greatly in the long run.    [Kosaric] The restoration of telephone and transport  communications is scheduled for the first phase. For the time  being, neither the first nor the latter has been accomplished.  When will the telephone communications be restored and is there  another condition for their restoration?    [Granic] We will discuss this concretely tomorrow. I have  previously told you what are the fundamental problems for the  Republic of Croatia. If we resolve some basic political issues,  then the restoration of telecommunications and, naturally, all  other communications will develop very quickly, in which Croatia  has a great interest. We do not expect everything to be  resolved instantaneously. We do not expect this. However, we  will raise all these issues tomorrow and we expect that they  will be resolved in progress and to the mutual interest of both  countries.    [Kosaric] Finally, on 15 March, you are supposed to travel  to Belgrade to continue the talks. Does your departure depend  on the success of the Zagreb round?    [Granic] I believe that my visit to Belgrade will take place  some time around 15 March. Regarding the success of the Zagreb  round, it is definite that progress will be reached regarding  the opening of the Croatian and FRY bureaus. It is definite  that we will make progress in the search for missing persons.  However, what progress we will make on the political issues  remains to be seen tomorrow. In any case, we would like to  accomplish major moves.    [Kosaric] Dr. Granic, can we then realistically expect the  opening of the FRY and Croatian bureaus in Zagreb and Belgrade  on 15 March in accordance with the Geneva declaration?    [Granic] We can, and I believe that Croatia will open its  bureau on 15 February. Just after our interview, we are having  a meeting to pass the final decision, however, I can say that  our side has completed all the preparations. On the other hand,  both sides have, so far, fulfilled all their obligations and we  expect that the opening will truly take place, perhaps even on  15 February.    I would like to say another thing. You see, no question will  be bypassed tomorrow. Naturally, we know very well that the  major FRY problems are, for example, sanctions, succession, and  other issues. We will definitely also touched upon the situation  in Bosnia-Herzegovina and search for the final cease-fire, an  end to the war, and a lasting peace. Therefore, it does not  mean that we will find solutions to everything tomorrow.  However, it is certain that we must discuss all problems  openly, regardless of how much we differ on them, and try to  draw closer. Of course, tomorrow will be the time and the day  when we will put forward the proposals for final solutions to  everything to one another.    [Kosaric] In the name of Radio Belgrade, Dr. Granic, thank  you for the interview.    [Granic] My pleasure.</p>

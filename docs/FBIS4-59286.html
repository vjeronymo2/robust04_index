			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Foreign Ministry spokesman </F> Mohammadi by unidentified station announcer--live]    [Text] Esteemed listeners, my colleague informed you in the  news that last night President Hashemi-Rafsanjani exposed  Britain's degradation in carrying out anti-Iranian espionage  activities. To give you more information on the issue, let us  speak to Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammadi on the telephone  right now:    [Announcer] As you know, our president revealed the British  espionage activities against Iran. We will be grateful if you  can provide more details for our listeners. When was the affair  discovered?    [Mohammadi] In the name of God, the compassionate, the  merciful. In the first week of Ordibehesht [21 April-21 May],  when work was being carried out on one of the walls in our  embassy in London, workers found a British electronic  surveillance device planted in the wall. The issue was assessed  so that all the British espionage activities might be  investigated and every action that contravenes diplomatic  parlance and the Vienna Convention regarding Britain's official  espionage might be exposed.    The British politicians tried to preempt this with a hasty  defensive reaction to cover up this aberration and actions that  violate diplomatic practices. They thus committed another  blunder. They propounded the issue of our collaboration with the  IRA.    [Announcer] Thank you. It appears that in its efforts to  cover up its humiliation stemming from its espionage, the London  government is pursuing other objectives with this propaganda  clamor. How do you appraise Britain's overall objectives with  this latest propaganda outcry?    [Mohammadi] Initially, these were attempts to conceal the  espionage affair and violation of diplomatic practices and  ethics. At the same time, Britain sought to mask the domestic  problems with which it has been grappling for quite some time.  By raising such issues in its foreign policy, Britain aims to  divert attention from internal and external policy issues.    We must mention our diplomatic efforts and moves regarding  the rights of the oppressed people of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the  conflict between our support for Bosnia-Herzegovina and British  policy. In this context the hue and cry raised by the British  was designed to counteract our policy. When the British  perceived their vulnerability and isolation in their support of  Rushdie against Muslim public opinion they were forced to  concoct a new issue to divert their public and replace the  Rushdie issue in this manner.    As a result, the objective pursued by Britain was that world  attention should be directed toward a new issue that would in  some way relate to the United States' accusatory and domineering  policies against the Islamic Republic of Iran.    [Announcer] I thank you for your explanations and Your  Excellency's participation in this talk.    [Mohammadi] I thank you. Goodbye.    Esteemed listeners, the latest news given to me by my  colleagues cites the BBC quoting a British Government spokesman  on the revelations of London's espionage against the Islamic  Republic of Iran. The spokesman said: We have nothing to say  in this regard.</p>

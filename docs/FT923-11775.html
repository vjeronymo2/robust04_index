			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / FT Law Report: Californian suit goes ahead ARAB MONETARY FUND v HASHIM AND OTHERS Chancery Division: Mr Justice Hoffmann: July 14 1992 AN ANTI-suit order restraining a defendant from proceeding in a foreign country against a witness will not be granted by the English court if it is unnecessary for the purpose of protecting the court's jurisdiction or enabling justice to be done in the UK. Mr Justice Hoffmann so held when refusing an application by the plaintiff, the Arab Monetary Fund (AMF), for an interlocutory injunction to restrain the defendants, Dr Jawar Mahmoud Hashim, and his wife and son Jafar, from prosecuting an action in California against Mr Salah al Hafidh, a former employee of the AMF. HIS LORDSHIP said Dr Hashim was director general of the AMF between 1977 and 1982. The AMF alleged that he defrauded it of more than Dollars 50m. It also claimed against other defendants including Mrs Hashim and Jafar, on the grounds that they knowingly assisted Dr Hashim or knowingly received some of the money. The writ was issued on December 5 1988. On the same day, the AMF applied for a world-wide Mareva injunction against Dr Hashim. The application was supported by a lengthy affirmation by Mr al Hafidh. Mr al Hafidh was a chartered accountant employed by the AMF as chief internal auditor, after Dr Hashim had left. He described in his affirmation how he had found apparent irregularities in the accounts. Large sums had been paid into accounts controlled by Dr Hashim in AMF's name. The money had been transferred to Swiss accounts in the name of Dr Hashim and his wife. The AMF had requested an independent investigation by Ernst &amp; Whinney, for whom Mr al Hafidh had worked before joining the AMF. Their report concluded that there was prima facie evidence of fraud by Dr Hashim. Together with a report by Swiss experts on what had happened to the money in the Swiss accounts it formed the basis of the Mareva application. Similar relief was granted against Mrs Hashim and Jafar. The trial had been fixed for January 1993. Mr al Hafidh resigned from the AMF in 1989 and emigrated to California. In October 1991, Dr and Mrs Hashim and Jafar commenced proceedings against him in the Los Angeles County Superior Court. The essence of the complaint was that Mr al Hafidh's affirmation was a false and malicious invention and part of a conspiracy between him, Ernst &amp; Whinney and the AMF, to ruin Dr Hashim and his family. The bedrock of those allegations was the question whether the AMF was right in saying Dr Hashim stole its money. If that turned out to be true, the case against Mr al Hafidh would collapse. That was the question which would be investigated in the English proceedings. If the AMF's case failed, the English court would not be concerned to enquire whether Mr al Hafidh acted in good faith or with malice. He was not a party to the English action and not subject to the court's jurisdiction. In those circumstances, the AMF applied for an injunction to restrain Mr Hashim, his wife and Jafar from prosecuting the Californian action until after the English trial. There was no doubt that the court had jurisdiction to grant such an injunction. The order was not directed to the Californian court but operated in personam against the respondents as persons subject to the jurisdiction of the English court. Dr and Mrs Hashim were resident in the UK and Jafar, though resident in Canada, had submitted to the jurisdiction. It was well established in the UK, as in the US, that an injunction to restrain proceedings in a foreign jurisdiction (an 'anti-suit' injunction) should be granted only in very narrowly restricted circumstances. Generally speaking, the foreign judge was in the best position to decide whether it was just and equitable that proceedings in his own court should be stayed or allowed to proceed. Such an order would be granted only if prosecution of the foreign proceedings appeared to be 'vexatious or oppressive'. Cases in which anti-suit injunctions had been granted or refused showed that 'vexatious or oppressive' had been given a very restrictive interpretation. They showed that it was not sufficient that the action should be vexatious or oppressive in the ordinary domestic sense in which such actions might be struck out. That was a decision which ought properly be left to the court before which the proceedings were pending. There had to be some good reason why the decision had to be made here rather than there. It might be because there was a conflict of national policy between the UK and the foreign tribunal. The injunction might be needed to protect the jurisdiction to prevent a litigant from evading important public policies. When the question was simply one of justice between litigants, uninfluenced by differences of national policy, the normal assumption was that the English court had no superiority over a foreign tribunal in knowing what justice required. And there might be cases in which, although there was no overt clash of national policy, the realities of litigation before the foreign tribunal might be such as to satisfy the court that justice could be achieved only by enjoining the foreign suit. Assuming for the purpose of the application that the AMF action might be part of a conspiracy to ruin Dr Hashim, and that its case failed and was shown to be have been a malicious plot to which Mr al Hafidh was party, it would obviously be unjust to prevent Dr Hashim from afterwards pursuing Mr al Hafidh in California. On the other hand if the AMF succeeded in proving its case, it would be an abuse of the process of the court for Dr Hashim to attempt to relitigate that question against Mr al Hafidh. In such a case the court would restrain a collateral attack on its jurisdiction by the commencement of such proceedings abroad. At present however, there had been no determination of the merits in the UK or US. The AMF claimed that pending trial here the court should grant an injunction to prevent interference with the jurisdiction by intimidation of a potential witness. The question was whether the injunction was necessary to enable justice to be done here or to safeguard the general jurisdiction of the court. On that question the following matters were relevant: First, Mr al Hafidh was not a witness of primary fact. He came on the scene after Dr Hashim had left, and could only depose as to the result of his investigations. Second, when the present proceedings were commenced the AMF was not intending to call Mr al Hafidh as a witness. He had said he did not want to come. It was as a result of the Californian action, and possibly financial assistance, that he changed his mind. Third, there was nothing to suggest that Dr and Mrs Hashim commenced the Californian action to dissuade Mr al Hafidh from giving evidence in the UK. They did not think he would be giving evidence here. The object seemed to have been to have the opportunity to examine him on discovery or at trial in Los Angeles. That might or might not be an abuse of process in California, but did not constitute an interference with the English proceedings. The court was not satisfied this fell within the exceptional class of cases in which an anti-suit injunction was needed to protect the jurisdiction of the English court. Whether the Californian proceedings should be stayed or proceed did not raise any question which could not equally well and more appropriately be decided in California. The motion was dismissed. For the AMF: Charles Flint (Freshfields). For Mr Hashim: Hugo Page (Landau and Scanlan).</p>

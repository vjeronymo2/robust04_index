			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Arts: Popular restoration - David Murray finds a fresh and clear approach in Man of Mode George Etherege's acrid comedy, playing in judicious tandem with Stephen Jeffrey's The Libertine at the Royal Court, gets a pretty well faultless production from Max Stafford-Clark. (The plays share their casts and sets as well as their director.) The first recorded staging of The Man of Mode was in 1676, and it was popular for 50 years; but later ages began to find it immoral and nasty, and after 1766 it seems not to have been revived until this century. It is easy enough to see why it aroused discomfort. Even its happy ending has a bitter edge: bed-hopping Dorimant weds Harriet because he truly loves her, but also because he needs her estate ' and until the final moments, his brutally discarded mistress and his younger paramour are at the party. In fact the play's hero is by a long way its most calculating and disillusioned character. A contemporary assessment of it as 'an agreeable representation of the persons of condition of both sexes, both in court and town' fairly takes one's breath away. Even by the high standards of Restoration comedy, the text is notably witty and literate, and Stafford-Clark's eleven-strong cast do it proud. Though it is played with unhesitating speed, nobody's tongue trips, and every phrase cuts cleanly through the air. Public behaviour is just as important, for it is endlessly discussed, mocked and indeed carefully illustrated at several points: it is what everybody most cares about. The cast get it beautifully right, never falling into slovenly modern ways but never into 'period' campery either ' not even Sir Fopling Flutter, who in the person of Tim Potter is so touchingly confident of not being the prancing idiot that he is, that he never looks like a caricature. Apart from its immorality, the most startlingly modern aspect of the play is the extreme, critical self-consciousness of nearly everyone else about his and her feelings. Again and again a character stands back from himself and discusses his own mechanism like a clinical researcher. David Westhead's slightly truculent dryness is nicely adapted to Dorimant in that mode; Katrina Levon's cast-off mistress, Mrs Lovett, does it in bursts of violent passion. There are no weak links. Amanda Drew makes a fresh but properly clear-sighted heiress Harriet (with a pretty whiff of the innocent countryside about her), Cathyrn Bradshaw a wry, fetching paramour. There is a doughty father Bellair from Bernard Gallagher, whose comic timing is excellent, and Barnaby Kay plays his son ' Dorimant's best friend ' with doggy eyes and a defenceless face, which contrasts with Dorimant's style. Jason Watkins plays Medley, a witty friend, sharply, and makes a rapturous, irresistible aria out of his description of Harriet. Peter Hartwell's sets are plain, economical and effective, and his costumes impeccably apt for the people they dress. John Baxter's group dances at the start and finish of the second act are infectious enough to make one want to join in; helpfully, the cast encourages two or three audience members to do just that, on stage. It did not feel like a gimmick. In several respects, this Man of Mode is the most intelligent and rewarding Restoration revival I've seen in years.</p>

			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Upgrades boost stores UPGRADES in profits estimates for Storehouse by four leading securities houses boosted shares in the clothing group yesterday as it hinted at buoyant sales just before it moved into the closed period when companies are inhibited from commenting on trading progress. SG Warburg, UBS Phillips and Drew, Nomura and County NatWest all raised forecasts, the range increasing by around Pounds 5m to a range of Pounds 34m-Pounds 39m. Sales increases at both Mothercare and BHS are credited for the upgrades, although some analysts also highlighted the group's restructuring measures and more focused management strategy. However, it was also pointed out that the figures compare with weak sales in the comparable period and that trading has fallen somewhat in the last two weeks as poor summer weather has affected the autumn selling season. Ms Kimlan Cook at County NatWest, who changed to a buyer of the stock two weeks ago, estimates that group sales are up around 9 per cent in the fist half this year, with Mothercare up 12 per cent and BHS 11 per cent. Storehouse shares climbed 6 to 148p and also gave a boost to other clothing retailers, among which Next added 5 tp 105p and Burton 2 to 41 1/2p. Utilities active After the shock of the price cuts in water supply ordered by Ofwat, some brokers took the opportunity to reassess prospects for the utility sector to allow for possible further regulatory action in the future. However, the main message was that in the current short-term economic uncertainty, utilities continue to offer safe and strong dividend growth. Mr Peter Hyde at Kleinwort Benson believes the downside risk for water stocks remains long-term and that in the short-term they will perform well. However, Mr Simon Taylor at Robert Flemings is advising clients to go underweight in waters because of the potential for further and harsher regulatory measures. However, Ms Donna Lury at Nikko said that water stocks, while the most at risk to regulation of all utilities, still offer strong defensive and recovery plays. She particularly likes Northumbrian Water, up 10 at 503p, Severn Trent, 7 to 406p, and Wessex Water 10 to 512p. Building materials group Redland shrugged off Thursday's profit downgradings and bounced strongly, closing as one of the best performing FT-SE stock on a weak day in the stock market. Buying for Monday's dividend payment, along with a re-assesment of the company's prospects following Thursday's better than expected interim results saw the shares jump 20 to 363p, at the day's peak. Profit taking and the downward pressure on the market as a whole forced the shares to surrender some of the earlier gains, but they still ended 16 up at 358p in reasonable turnover of 2.8m shares. The shares had been in the doldrums in the period leading up to the interims as the market wrongly anticipated a poor set of interim figures. The release of the figures which showed a jump of nearly Pounds 10m in profits to Pounds 88.5m and the reassurance from the company that it would pay an unchanged dividend for 1992 were however ignored on Thursday as dealers instead focused on the clutch of profit downgradings delivered analysts. Trafalgar House, in which Hongkong Land now has a near 15 per cent stake had calmer session yesterday. The shares fell 4 to 85 1/2 p, around the price at which Hongkong Land has said it wants to acquire another 15 per cent in Trafalgar. Turnover in the ordinary shares reached 6.3m. Business services group BET was once again at the receiving end of a broker's downgrading, this time from Strauss Turnbull. The shares fell another 7 to 95p. British Telecom announced a new package of pricing mechanisms, designed to strengthen brand loyalty. The shares shaded 1 1/2 to 355 1/2 . Talk that enquiries to Vodafone's new Low-Call cellular operation were very encouraging lifted the shares 7 to 340p. Elsewhere in the sector, shares in Pilkington fell 6 to 77p,making it the day's worst performing stock in the market, in percentage termsNews that Cadbury-Schweppes would be making large redundancy provisions overhung the shares, which fell back 10 to 428p, as most houses downgraded the food group. Nomura was recommending a switch into Unilever, 17 ahead at 1077p. Old Whispers that Dalgety, down 4 at 419p, was stalking RHM were given little credence by the market. The shares climbed 7 to 175p. A big seller of stock in WH Smith knocked the stores group back 14 to 426p. In a weak breweries sector, Scottish and Newcastle retreated 18 to 412p. The company was hosting an analysts' visit to one of its Centre Parc complexes in Paris and lack of feedback from France appeared to be restraining the shares yesterday. There was more bleak news for Grand Metropolitan - the drinks group has been under pressure all week from brokers downgrades - as US investment bank Paine Webber reduced its profit forecast. The shares shed 18 to 384p. A recommendation from Kleinwort Benson helped Fisons gain 7 to 196p. SmithKline Beecham held up ahead of a meeting of the US authorities on Monday where approval is expected for Seroxat, one of the company's frontline drugs, The shares lost a penny to 491p. Profit taking left Enterprise Oil 5 lighter at 425p. The shares had performed particularly well for most of the week, following news that it had filed for a listing of its American Depositary Shares (ADR) in New York. Investors continued to view Shell Transport, as the 'quality stock' in the oil sector and the shares held up relatively well easing only 2 to 545p, on turnover of 545p. Shares in USM-listed Ramco Oil jumped 15 to 51p, after announcing it (and a partner) had signed an exclusive exploration agreement with the Government of Azerbaijan to develop a field in the Caspian Sea. Shares in freight group NFC fell sharply after the company issued Pounds 80m worth of convertible bonds. The shares closed 17 down at 252p. The news that British Airways is to postpone plans to proceed with the implementation of its Dollars 750m purchase of a 44 per cent stake in USAir upset the shares which eased 6 to 289p. Sellers were seen in P&amp;O and the shares retreated 12 to 398p. Profit taking in BAA left the shares 14 lighter at 713p. In engineers, TI Group jumped 16 to 298p, on further appreciation of the lower than anticipated provisions made for the Dowty Group acquisition. Sentiment was also boosted by the appreciating dollar. Siebe, normally a beneficiary of an improved dollar retreated 18 to 341p, with broker Williams de Broe reported to have a large line of the stock on its books. The stock was also said to have suffered from switching into TI Group. British Steel was in demand. The shares hardened 1 1/2 to 62 1/2 p, as turnover swelled to 13m.

			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / International Company News: Honda Motor slides to Y10bn in quarter HONDA Motor, the Japanese car and motorcycle maker, yesterday reported a 36 per cent fall in net profits to Y10.72bn (Dollars 83.75m) for the third quarter to end-December from Y16.75bn a year earlier, AP-DJ reports. Sales advanced 2.8 per cent to Y1,045bn from Y1,017bn. Earnings per share were down 35 per cent at Y10.96 compared with Y17.01. The directors said the rise in turnover was made mainly on the back of strong motorcycle sales in Asia and sales of new car models worldwide. However, they said pre-tax profits fell because the yen was stronger during the quarter compared with the same period a year ago, and operating expenses grew at a faster rate than sales. For the whole year, however, the directors are maintaining their forecast that net income would come to Y80.10bn - a rise of 5.1 per cent over the previous year - and they see sales of Y4,528bn, up 5 per cent. Third-quarter operating income totalled Y22.01bn, down 20 per cent from Y27.58bn. Net profits fell more sharply than both operating income and pre-tax profits because of a fall in equity income in affiliates. During the third quarter, motorcycle sales amounted to Y106.6bn, a gain of 0.1 per cent. Unit sales for the period totalled 802,000 vehicles, up 7.4 per cent from the year before. Car sales rose 4.1 per cent to Y873.70bn, 'owing primarily to better product mix in both Japan and North America,' the directors said, although in terms of volume, car sales fell 3.7 per cent to 467,000 units. Revenue from other businesses fell 9.7 per cent to Y64.8bn, mainly reflecting a fall in sales of power products. For the first nine months pre-tax profits fell 2.5 per cent to Y112.58bn, while net profits fell 13 per cent to Y53.84bn and sales rose 3.6 per cent to Y3,274bn. Honda said sales had picked up in Japan and the US, but that improvement probably would not be enough to boost full-year earnings beyond the projections made in January.</p>

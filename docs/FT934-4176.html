			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Fashion: Designing is so tough, sighs Japan's queen of innovation - Alice Rawsthorn meets Rei Kawakubo, a major force in the industry for 20 years Rei Kawakubo sits at a small, square table in the Comme des Garcons office on Place Vendome in Paris, fidgets with her silver bangles and heaves a deep sigh. 'I don't find it enormous fun being a fashion designer,' she says. 'The fashion system is very hard. It's ridiculous to be expected to find a new direction every six months. But my clients expect me to move forward with each collection. It's tough.' Tough, or not, few designers have done it better than Kawakubo, 51, who has been one of the most innovative forces in fashion for the 20 years since she founded Comme des Garcons in Tokyo. She is still known best for the stark, monochrome clothes she showed in her first Paris collections during the early 1980s. But she now has a new prominence as an important influence over the present crop of young European designers - Martin Margiela and Ann Demeulemeester. 'One word sums her up - individual,' says Katell le Bourhis, director of the Musee des Arts de la Mode in Paris. 'Most fashion designers re-interpret influences from the world around them. Rei Kawakubo is one of the very few who is absolutely herself. She pursues her own vision without ever, ever compromising.' Everything about Kawakubo, from her bluntly bobbed hair to her intense expression, exudes purpose. She sits in the Place Vendome office wearing one of her pinstripe pinafores over a black jumper with the sleeves rolled-up, ready for work. Her face is free from make-up. The only visible concessions to feminine vanity are the bangles and her nails which, surprisingly, are manicured meticulously. Kawakubo is the sole owner of Comme des Garcons, a Dollars 100m (Pounds 70m) company, which ranks her alongside Donna Karan in New York as one of the world's wealthiest female fashion designers. She exercises rigorous control over every aspect of the business, from packaging design to insisting that her 400 employees clear their desks before leaving each evening. 'The breadth of her vision is remarkable,' says Deyan Sudjic, editor of Blueprint, a design magazine, and author of a book about Kawakubo. 'She is not a conventional fashion designer who allows their clothes to be sold in someone else's shop. She goes further than that.' Kawakubo was born in Tokyo in 1942. Her father was an academic at Keio University, one of Japan's most noted educational institutions, and she studied fine art there before working as a stylist in the advertising industry, one of the few areas of business then open to young Japanese women. She started designing clothes to use in her advertisements and registered Comme as a company in 1973. The name was chosen, uncharacteristically, on a whim. 'There was no serious reason,' she says. 'I just liked the sound of it.' Kawakubo was lucky. She began her business at a time when the Japanese economy had repaired the damage caused by the second world war and was starting its period of frenetic growth. Many of the most influential figures in contemporary Japanese design started at the same time, including Yohji Yamamoto and Issey Miyake in fashion, Shiro Kuramata in furniture, and Tadao Ando in architecture. Japan, late in the 1960s, was in a cultural vacuum, still struggling to find a new identity after losing the war and the US occupation. Yamamoto, with whom Kawakubo had a long personal relationship, once described their generation of Japanese as 'rootless'. Kawakubo turned this rootlessness to her advantage. She had no formal fashion training and says she has no conscious memory of western fashion from her youth. Whereas today's young Japanese designers are bombarded by images of the French and Italian clothes crammed into Tokyo department stores, Kawakubo had nothing to draw on but her imagination. 'I created my own tradition,' she says. 'I'm not inspired directly by other people or even by places. I try to detach myself from the outside world and work within my own vision. Everything is very internalised.' The result is an unapologetically modern form of opulence. At its simplest, Kawakubo's approach is a blend of austere Zen aesthetics and technological innovation through the luxurious synthetic fibres and fabric finishes she develops with Hiroshi Matsushita, the Japanese fabric technologist. Over the years, she has been responsible for a string of fashion 'firsts' - assymetric silhouettes, irregular hemlines, unfinished edges, double collars and odd buttons - many of which have been seized upon by other designers and then diluted for the mass market. Comme devotees are attracted less by her innovations than by the quality of the fabrics and her hidden touches, such as the exquisite linings and beautifully finished buttonholes. Kawakubo attracts the same sort of wealthy, arty customers to her shops in London and New York, as in Tokyo. Charles Saatchi, the UK advertising executive, is a fan, as are Alan Yentob, controller of BBC1 television, artist Francesco Clemente and furniture designer Tom Dixon. 'I love her stuff,' says Dixon. 'Sometimes, you look at some of the weirder styles and think 'Hmm'. But most of her designs are really very classic. I've got a lot of wear - really a lot of wear - out of my Comme clothes.' Kawakubo still spends most of her time in Tokyo where she works 14 hours a day with her collaborators, many of whom, such as Matsushita, have been with her since the start. One of her latest interests is the furniture she designs with Toshiaki Oshiba, using the same combination of minimalist forms and modern materials as her clothes. 'I can do things with furniture that I can't with fashion,' she says. 'A piece of furniture is a pure object whereas clothes always have to be worn, which imposes limitations.' Her fashion collections have softened in recent seasons. Black still looms large, but this autumn's range includes beautiful brocades and translucent viscoses in more mellow shades. Some observers attribute the new style to Kawakubo's marriage last year to Adrian Joffe, an Englishman in charge of her European business. She is as uncompromising as ever, though. Kawakubo visited Tom Dixon's south London studio recently to choose some work for the Comme shop in New York. She rummaged around until she found a lamp he was making by stretching brightly-coloured pieces of tissue paper over a wire frame. 'Rei knew exactly what she wanted,' says Dixon. 'She pointed at the lamp and said: 'I'll have 10 of those - all in black'.' Comme des Garcons is at 59 Brook Street, London W1</p>

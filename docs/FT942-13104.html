			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / CBI says cut in interest rates is not necessary The Confederation of British Industry said yesterday it saw no need for a cut in UK interest rates, despite some weaker than expected indicators in its latest quarterly industrial trends survey. The survey showed that, since January, manufacturing output had risen at its fastest rate for five years. But City analysts were disappointed by the survey's findings on waning optimism among manufacturers. The CBI has often been forthright in calling for interest rate cuts in the past, but Sir David Lees, chairman of the CBI's economic affairs committee, said the panel had been unanimous in deciding that the survey did not justify an immediate cut in interest rates. 'I think there's clearly a strong feeling in industry which says that interest rates are probably now pretty near the bottom and what industry really needs, and is beginning to get, is a period of stability in both exchange rates and in interest rates,' he said. Sir David added that a quarter of a percentage point cut, which then had to be quickly reversed, would be more damaging to confidence than allowing rates to bottom out at the current level. Only if the tax increases which took effect this month showed signs of causing the recovery to falter, should the issue of rate cuts be revisited, he said. The balance of manufacturing companies which said they were more optimistic than four months previously dropped to 13 percentage points in April, from 27 points in January. Large companies (those with more than 5,000 employees) have become more pessimistic over the last four months. Sir David said he thought the tax increases may have cast a shadow over the optimism indicator. Traditionally, respondents are most optimistic in April, but the change in the Budget's timing may have altered this seasonal effect. Nevertheless, some analysts described the optimism figures as disappointing. The survey had some good news on inflation with slightly more companies planning to cut, rather than increase, prices over the next four months. Growth in orders, output and exports is expected to continue. However, investment intentions remain modest, with only a small balance planning to invest in plant and equipment over the next year. Manufacturing companies are still planning to shed jobs over the next four months. The CBI concluded that 'the momentum of recovery will be maintained into the summer months. Rising manufacturing output will be accompanied by higher domestic, and more particularly, export orders. Net exports seem well placed to add to overall economic growth in the UK economy in the months ahead.' Inflation pressures tamed, Page 8</p>

			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Technology: A clear view for contacts Contact lenses, which float in the eye's tear fluid, are for those who want improved vision and prefer the inconvenience of taking them in and out - and the risk of losing them - to the inconvenience of wearing glasses. Their use became possible this century with the development of modern plastics, whereas spectacles have been around since the Middle Ages. But the idea of a lens fitting straight over the eye has been around for a long time. Leonardo da Vinci drew a design for such a device in the 15th century. Four hundred years later, the first contact lens appeared. It was made of glass and covered most of the eye. Today's lenses parallel some of the developments in spectacles - such as the availability of tints and application to presbyopes as well as to people with congenital sight defects - but they also have to overcome difficulties of their own. The first contacts were hard and not always easy to wear. But the rapid development of soft and disposable lenses, with a high water content, has decreased the hard products' market share. Because they sit on the eye, contact lenses are prone to deterioration and protein build-up. Today's hard lenses are gas permeable, allowing eyes to breathe. In the view of Gary Mulloy, chief executive of California-based Pilkington Barnes-Hind, part of Pilkington of the UK, manufacturers need to be more innovative, especially in catering for presbyopes. Companies do have products for these users. Essilor's Lunelle division has brought out Variations, which it says is the first progressive soft lens for presbyopes; it contains 78 per cent water. But Mulloy sees prospects for further design and materials innovations in this area, as well as to bring back customers who found contacts awkward to use. 'Drop-outs have been a major problem.'</p>

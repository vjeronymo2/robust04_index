			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Agricultural forecast by Tamara Maksimenkova, chief </F> agrometeorologist of the Agricultural Meteorological Forecasts  Department of the Russian Hydrometeorological Center: "Under the  Snow Blanket"]    [Text] Over almost all of February, cold weather persisted  over the entire territory of Russia. It warmed up only during  the last few days of the month; precipitation, on the other  hand, was low (mostly 20-40 percent of the normal level). The  coldest temperatures in the European part of Russia were  registered during the first half of the month. The average  temperature during that period was eight to 12 degrees below  normal.    However, on the greater part of the territory of the  Central,  Central Chernozem, in the south of the Volgo-Vyatka and Urals  regions, and in the Middle Volga area winter grain crops and  perennial grasses were securely protected from cold by a  sufficiently high snow cover. In most places it was 35-45  centimeters high, which is one and a half to two times as high  as the average value calculated over many years.    The lowest soil temperature at the winter grain tilling  depth  here stayed mainly within the optimum range--minus six to minus  nine degrees, and the extreme cold (minus 28-35 degrees and  below) was not dangerous for the crops.    In the Central Chernozem region, in the eastern part of the  Central region, and in the Middle Volga area registered cold  temperatures (below -28 degrees) could cause damage to flower  buds and the annual growth of fruit-bearing plants in some  places.    In the Northern, the northern part of the Central, and in  the  north part of the Volgo-Vyatka and Urals regions winter grain  crops were still under a very high (55-65 centimeters or more)  snow cover. Soil did not freeze much under such a blanket.    Rotting process have been noticed over the greater part of  the month. Plants continued to intensively use up nutrients for  breathing, which leads to their exhaustion. These conclusions  are supported by results of test sprouting of winter crops  conducted by meteorological stations. Higher than usual  sparseness of winter rye plants in tests (more than 10 percent  of plants, and in places more than 30 percent) has been already  noted in a number of rayons in Vologda, Yaroslavl, and Kirov  Oblasts, as well as in some fields in Arkhangelsk and Perm  Oblasts and the Republic of Bashkortostan. The lowest soil  temperature at the tilling depth of winter crops was around  freezing in February as well.    In the North Caucasus and the Lower Volga area the coldest  temperatures were registered in the beginning of the second  10-day period of February. The average air temperature during  this period was seven to 12 degrees below normal. There was no  snow cover in the fields, or its height was no more than 1-3  centimeters. The soil cooled quickly. The lowest soil  temperature at the winter grain tilling depth dropped to minus  12-15 degrees.    In the south of Rostov Oblast, in a number of rayons in  Krasnodar Kray, and in some rayons in Stavropol Kray, as well as  in Kalmykia and Astrakhan Oblast, the soil temperature at the  winter crops tilling depth was even lower--minus 16-18 degrees  (in the south of Astrakhan Oblast -20 degrees). In this region,  winterkilling is possible over a considerable part of the area,  especially of underdeveloped crops of winter wheat and barley,  and in the south of Astrakhan Oblast, of rye.    An unfavorable factor for further wintering of winter crops  is that a ground-in ice crust remains on the soil in the fields  in the Northwestern, Central, and Central Chernozem regions and  in some places in the south of the Volga Region. Its thickness  practically has not increased in February and measured 15-30  millimeters in most places, and in Saratov and Volgograd  Oblasts, 10-20 millimeters.    In West Siberia, winter grain crops in February were under a  snow cover that in most places was 25-45 centimeters high or  more. Therefore, despite severe cold temperatures registered  during some periods of the month, the lowest soil temperature at  the winter crops tilling depth stayed mostly within the range of  -7 to -12 degrees and only in some places in Altay Kray and  Kemerovo Oblast did it drop to minus 16-20 degrees. The  wintering of winter grain crops in February proceeded well.    According to the preliminary forecast of the Russian  Hydrometeorological Center, the average air temperature in March  over the greater part of territory is expected to be one to  three degrees above average. Only on the greater part of the  territory of the North Caucasus region will it be close to  normal.    The amount of precipitation to the south of the  Kaluga-Penza-Samara line is expected to be below normal; in the  Northwestern region and in the Urals--above normal. On the rest  of the territory of the European part of Russia it will be close  to normal.    In the northeastern part of the European territory higher  than usual temperatures expected in March (two-three degrees  above normal) will help to melt snow in the fields and to  diminish the rot damage to winter grain crops.</p>

			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Number-crunchers hope to beat index with 'quant' leap: Norma Cohen looks at changes in working methods as technology develops towards active stock selection BRITISH fund managers have long prided themselves on their ability to sniff out an undervalued stock and add it to their portfolio at a cheap price. But the poor performance returns of too many of these classic 'active' fund managers have soured clients who, increasingly, are showing an interest in alternative approaches to stock selection. In this spirit, a statistics-driven system of stock selection, pioneered largely in the US, is gaining currency in the UK and international markets. 'Active quantitative' stock selection is basically a marriage of the analysis by traditional fund managers and the use of computers which is the basis of quantitive technique. Known in the US as 'black box' technique because of its reliance on computers, UK firms have begun to offer it to pension fund clients. In passive quantitative stock selection, the fund manager simply builds a portfolio to mimic a specific stock index, making no judgments on relative merits of stocks. 'Active quant' is a more systematic approach to active portfolio management. 'We try to replicate with a computer what a traditional fund manager would do by hand,' says Mr Kevin Rowe, partner at Buchanan Partners, an active quant boutique which specialises in the use of equity derivatives. 'The difference is risk control.' The idea that risk can be reduced by selecting stocks after analysing vast amounts of information about their characteristics is gaining currency in Britain. Among the leading providers of active quant fund management are Hill Samuel Asset Management, State Street, County NatWest Investment Management, Kleinwort Benson and several boutiques, particularly Pareto Partners, PanAgora Asset Management and Barr-Rosenberg. The growth of active quant in the UK has also been aided by the arrival of several firms whose sole function is to provide databases to analysts. Among them are California-based Barra Company and a new UK firm, Quantech. 'I think that 10 years from now we will find that traditional active management has declined significantly and a much more computer-oriented approach will take its place,' says Mr Roger Irwin, senior partner at actuarial consultants R Watson and Co. 'The top-quality active quant products will overtake the top-quality traditional products.' Not all consultants are as enthusiastic. Mr Robert Baker, partner at Mercer Fraser, notes that some traditional active managers score consistently above average returns using none of the data-based analysis favoured by the active quants. Also, there is a basic scepticism towards a technique that seems to guarantee above-average returns. But those who sell the technique insist its popularity is growing. Mr Alan Greenhorn, formerly director of quantitative fund management at Hill Samuel where he pioneered the firm's product, says that slowly, the technique is gaining credibility in Britain. Hill Samuel manages about Pounds 450m for 11 pension fund clients, as well as managing the core of Cambridge's Emmanuel College trust fund. Mr Greenhorn and his team recently moved to State Street, a division of the US firm which specialises in both passive and active quantitative fund management techniques in the American markets. 'A few years ago, if you held a conference on active quant, maybe three people would have shown up,' he says. 'Now you would get dozens.' What makes active quant different, he adds, is that vast quantities of data can be studied to help form a clearer picture of a stock's value. 'We have spent three years building up a database of UK stocks showing each stock's exposure to different sectors.' The data showed that many stocks are misrepresented by conventional classification systems. For instance, although P&amp;O, the shipping company, is generally classified as a transport stock, Hill Samuel's analysis showed that only 35 per cent of its revenues come from transport. In looking for risk, Hill Samuel examines such factors as the concentration of earnings from different sectors by a company, overseas earnings and cashflow as well as macro-economic factors such as interest and exchange-rate risk and short-term price volatility. Because large quantities of data about each company - and about the market in which it operates - must be analysed in depth, computers are needed. The aim is to isolate those characteristics most likely to occur in underperforming stocks. What they are and how to spot them is a subject of some debate. Mr Alan Brown, chief investment officer at PanAgora Fund Managers, says that his stock selection process has isolated roughly a dozen factors which are likely to affect share values, such as price-to-book ratios and dividend yield. Because the technique is aimed as much at reducing risk as it is at optimising returns, it is not likely to outperform an index by more than one to two percentage points, he says. But in an industry where outperforming an index consistently by even a fraction of 1 per cent is considered outstanding, the attractions of active quant are clear. Mr Rick Lecaille, assistant director at County NatWest Investment Management, which is also offering an active quant product, says: 'The data quality has improved dramatically over the past three years, and so has the technology.' Our view, is that we take the same approach as traditional active stock managers. We strip out the key features they use in stock analysis and build those into a computer model. I predict that in a few years, all the traditional managers will be using some form of active quant technique.'</p>

			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Motoring: Middleweight champions Call it luck or good planning, but I have just spent a week driving, turn and turn about over familiar roads in normal conditions, what I reckon are Europe's two best medium-sized and priced diesel cars. There is no better way to gain a realistic idea of how a car will perform in a buyer's or user-chooser's hands. New model launches in glamorous places are all very well. They are entertaining and enjoyable to go on. But a few hours driving gives only a taste of a car. The two cars were a Citroen Xantia 1.9TD VSX - my current personal transport  -and a VW Golf 1.9TDI GL. The Xantia, which has been consistently outselling the Rover 600, Nissan Primera and Toyota Carina in Britain, is beyond argument the most elegant family car of all. Though VW's Golf will not win beauty contests, its looks are clean and inoffensive. Styling apart, the strongest feature of the Xantia is its gas/hydraulic, self-levelling suspension. No other car in its class comes near to it for ride comfort over every kind of road. Bumps are swallowed. Electronic sensors detect and stifle incipient roll on fast corners by stiffening the suspension on the left or right side as necessary. Regardless of its load, the Xantia always remains on an even keel and the quality of its ride is unchanged. There is nothing wrong with the Golf's ride or handling, either, but it simply does not rise to the same heights of excellence as the Xantia. Both cars have 1.9-litre capacity turbo-diesel engines. The Citroen's is the latest development of the XUD unit which for more than 10 years has set a standard against which others have been judged. It may well be approaching the end of its production life in its present form but has few rivals for refinement and performance. The Golf's is a direct injection (DI) engine, the Citroen's (like those of practically all other diesel cars) has indirect injection (ID). Without going into technicalities, DI means that fuel is injected straight into the cylinder, ID that it goes into a chamber a few millimetres to one side. Direct injection is inherently more economical. But it is also noisier. On paper, the performance statistics of both cars are remarkably similar. The Golf's engine puts out 90 horsepower at 4,000 revolutions per minute, the Xantia's 92hp, also at 4,000rpm. Their maximum torque (pulling power at a given engine speed) is virtually identical, but the Golf's peaks at 1,900rpm, the Xantia's at 2,250rpm. What this means is that the Golf wins hands down for flexibility at low to moderate speeds. The Xantia's engine is smooth but feels lethargic until the turbocharger begins delivering useful boost at just under 2,000rpm. The Golf's, though, comes alive at little more than 1,500rpm and is pulling like a heavy truck's diesel long before 2,000rpm is reached. The Golf 1.9 TDI climbed hills strongly at least one gear higher than the Xantia. Keep the tachometer needle over 2,000rpm and the Xantia's performance is beyond reproach. Hard driven, it is a flyer. The Golf TDI is far more economical than the Xantia, easily capable of bettering 50mpg (5.65 l/100km) against the Citroen's figure of just over 40mpg (7.06 l/100km). But the Golf is also noisier. The VW engine, which starts instantly from cold without needing a few seconds pre-heating from glow plugs, is decidedly throbby at low speeds and is never so self-effacing as the Xantia's. The Xantia's engine is so quiet that the modest sounds from the tyres and the air conditioning drown its hum. Both cars have five-speed gearboxes; the Golf's is the silkier of the two. Citroen has just given a facelift to the Xantia and the big XM for 1995, adding driver-side airbags while keeping the radio controls on the steering wheel. The XM turbo-diesel now has a 2.5-litre engine - still an indirect injection unit - but comes only with manual gears. No automatic transmission is strong enough to handle the 2.5's pulling power. Buyers wedded to diesel and two-pedal control must still have the original 12-valve, 2.1-litre engine. If anyone at Citroen is listening, I have a suggestion. Put the XM's 2.1-litre engine - I am assured it would fit - and automatic transmission in a Xantia. It would have 20 per cent more power and torque than the current 1.9-litre turbo-diesel, which is not available at all as an automatic though the non-turbo version is. Given Citroen's traditionally keen pricing, it would knock sideways what little competition there is among mid-sized executive two-pedal turbo-diesels.</p>

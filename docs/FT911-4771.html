			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Japanese greet Gorbachev with icy politeness PRESIDENT Mikhail Gorbachev's attempt to open a new relationship with Japan and ease political tensions in the Asia-Pacific region appeared to be on the brink of failure yesterday. He was politely received in separate magnificent occasions by government, MPs and business leaders - but nowhere has he made the political or personal breakthroughs which had been his hallmark in the West in the late 1980s, and which he hoped to repeat during a four-day visit to Japan. The issue at the core of the frigid relations between the two countries  - the Soviet Union's refusal to return the four Kurile Islands seized from Japan immediately after the war - continues to prevent radical improvements on any level: political, commercial or diplomatic. Mr Gorbachev and Mr Toshiki Kaifu, the Japanese premier, met twice yesterday, the latter session with only one or two aides each and devoted to the problem of the disputed islands - but without evident agreement. A further session, billed as the final one, is to be held this morning. All the indications are that Mr Kaifu has urged a series of compromises on the Soviet president - notably, that he return to the Soviet position of 1956, under which two of the four islands were offered and the status of the other two left open. Mr Gorbachev has apparently responded by proposing more talks on the dispute in the future - but with no hint of leaning towards the Japanese position. Most speculation in Tokyo last night pointed to a communique today which recognised the existence of a territorial dispute, but stated the two countries' different positions. In a speech to the Japanese Diet yesterday, Mr Gorbachev implicitly recognised the existence of the territorial issue - something the Soviet side has previously refused to do. In a passage added to the official text, he said the outcome of the meetings would be a resolution of the issues the war had left behind - 'including the most difficult one of all - that of territorial demarcation'. In the same speech, he talked of 'past mistakes (which) should be corrected'. But these were symbolic gestures to a Japanese audience - and fell far short of the major steps for which Mr Kaifu has asked, and which Mr Gorbachev would have to deliver for substantial amounts of investment and aid to be released. The main substance of Mr Gorbachev's Diet address - a wide-ranging plea for a new security order in the Pacific, involving a conference of China, India, Japan, the Soviet Union and the US, together with unilateral Soviet military reductions to be followed by multilateral cuts - carried little weight with MPs and was not even put formally to Mr Kaifu by Mr Gorbachev. A spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry said last night that Mr Gorbachev mentioned only the five-power conference, and otherwise did not raise the security issue. Asked if Mr Kaifu had received the idea without enthusiasm, the spokesman said: 'You would not be wrong'.</p>

			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Craxi's political fate to be decided today THE political fate of Mr Bettino Craxi, the Italian Socialist leader, is expected to be decided today at a meeting of the party's executive called to consider the implications of his alleged involvement in the Milan corruption scandal. Mr Craxi was served notice on Monday he was under investigation by Milan magistrates for alleged corruption and illegal financing of the Socialist Party. He has declared his innocence in combative tone, but a growing body of the party feels his leadership is deeply compromised. The main problem the executive faces is the choice of successor. Prof Giuliano Amato, prime minister, is understood to be reluctant to accept, as this would probably oblige him to leave office and so force a change of government. Other candidates like Mr Claudio Martelli, the justice minister, do not have sufficient support. If Mr Craxi resigns, the party might opt for an interim leadership. Uncertainties surrounding the future of the Socialists, key members of the four-party government coalition, helped push the lira down further yesterday. It was being traded at L901-L902 against the D-Mark. The Italian Bankers Association backed a half-point cut in lending rates by the end of the month, after government criticism of the high rates charged to industry. Doctors and medical staff yesterday staged a one-day strike, closing all but emergency health services in protest at government plans for a radical shake-up of the system.</p>

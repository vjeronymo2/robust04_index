			<p><P> August 8, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: INTERNATIONAL TRADE;  </P> <P> CALCOMP'S GROWING MIDEAST SALES EFFORT NOW AT 'STANDSTILL'  </P> <P> This was supposed to be the year that CalComp, the Anaheim computer graphics  manufacturer, made headway in cracking the Middle East market.  </P> <P> Through June of this year, the company's exports to the Middle East jumped 42%,  to $1 million, from the same period last year.  </P> <P> And the company was projecting that exports to the region would double by  year's end.  </P> <P> But after Iraqi troops swept into Kuwait and occupied the tiny oil-rich nation,  "our business in the Middle East literally has come to a standstill," said  Larry Sanders, CalComp's sales and marketing manager. "A number of our  shipments enroute to that region were secured by letters of credit from banks  in Kuwait."  </P> <P> CalComp isn't the only Orange County company that is beginning to feel the  pinch from trouble in the Persian Gulf.  </P> <P> Unless oil prices drop in the next few days, the county's exporters and  importers say they expect to be paying higher transportation costs.  </P> <P> "The steamship companies that I spoke to Monday are adopting a wait-and-see  attitude and they told me they'd know in 10 days if prices will rise or not,"  said Kathleen Riggs of Tansey &amp; Riggs, an El Toro freight forwarder.  </P> <P> "Basically, if you go and charter a vessel now for a sailing to take place in  the next month, you'd have a hard time finding a price because of the  uncertainty of the fuel cost," said Dave Carden, president of Nedrac, a Costa  Mesa freight-forwarding company that charters vessels for exporters.  "Everybody's very nervous."  </P> <P> There is some consolation, though, for U.S. traders: Many of their foreign  competitors face similar problems now that their governments have joined the  call for economic sanctions against Iraq.  </P></p>

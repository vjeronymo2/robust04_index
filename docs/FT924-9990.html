			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / GM board chooses chief executive: Decision to appoint non-executive chairman breaks company tradition MR Jack Smith, who turned around General Motors' European operations in the 1980s, was yesterday appointed chief executive of the struggling US company in a sweeping management shake-up. GM also halved its quarterly dividend. Mr Smith, aged 54 and group president for the past seven months, replaces Mr Robert Stempel, who resigned last week as chairman and chief executive under pressure from GM's non-executive directors. They argued that he was not moving with sufficient urgency to stem losses in the company's North American vehicle operations. Mr John Smale, leader of the outside directors' revolt, was elected non-executive chairman at a board meeting in New York which also shook up the ranks of GM's senior management. Three prominent executives closely associated with the old GM regime have taken early retirement along with Mr Stempel, apparently following board pressure; and the company's management committee, which sets strategy, has been reconstituted as a much younger, five-man team led by Mr Smith. GM yesterday stressed that Mr Smale, 65 and a former chairman of Procter &amp; Gamble, the consumer products group, will not be an officer of the company or run it. The division of power between a non-executive chairman and chief executive breaks with a long tradition, at both GM and US companies generally, of combining the two offices. It will give a fillip to the US movement for better corporate governance  - how businesses are run - which has long advocated such a split. The board also cut GM's quarterly dividend from 40 cents to 20 cents, saying that market conditions in the US and Europe were highly uncertain and it was critically important the company continued its capital investment in new vehicles. The move had been widely expected on Wall Street and GM's shares closed at Dollars 31 7/8 , up Dollars 1 1/8 , in a positive reaction to the management changes. Yesterday's action caps a meteoric rise for Mr Smith, who was head of GM's international operations until last April. That was when a non-executive board coup led to his appointment as president and head of the troubled North American operations, with a mandate to turn them around quickly. Mr Smith will now be responsible for all operations worldwide, including its non-automotive defence, financial services and information services businesses. Another beneficiary of the shake-up is Mr William Hoglund, 58, previously the chief financial officer, who has been elected to the GM board and is to head a new corporate affairs and staff support group. He will assist Mr Smith in managing the troubled north American auto operations. The three executives who have taken early retirement are Mr Robert Schultz, 62, group vice-chairman; Mr Lloyd Reuss, 56, who was in charge of north American automotive operations until Mr Smith replaced him in April; and Mr F. Alan Smith, 61, an executive vice-president in charge of the corporate support group. However, Mr Roger Smith, chairman of GM until 1990 and a man blamed by critics for many of GM's problems, remains on the group's board, contrary to rumours that fellow directors might pressure him to step down.</p>

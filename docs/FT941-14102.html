Eleven of its 12 businesses improved net earnings and 10, led by GE Capital, television broadcaster NBC, plastics and power stations, had achieved double digit increases. Earnings from aircraft engines, which has been suffering from the downturn in the airline industry, were much lower than in 1992. The group's on-going operating margin rose to a record 12.5 per cent from 1992's 11.5 per cent, while cash generated from continuing operations reached a record Dollars 5.2bn, driven by an improvement in inventory turns to six.

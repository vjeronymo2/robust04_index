			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / Observer: Classic route to the investor No one can blame Goldman Sachs for racking its collective brains in search of inventive arguments with which to back Daimler-Benz as it rides down Wall Street next week. But could the US investment bank, co-adviser for the New York Stock Exchange share listing, be working potential investors a mite too hard? 'The concept of crisis in classical aesthetics from Aristotle to Hegel represents the turning point of a fateful process,' the 285-page buy note opens, presumably easing the reader in gently. 'The crisis has the appearance of an objective fate bursting in from without. In fact the contradiction expressed at the catastrophic moment of the drama has long been present in the dramatic action and the personalities of the heroes . . .' the document elaborates. Forced for the purposes of the listing to drop the veil of German accounting conventions, under which Daimler had forecast a tidy profit of DM1bn this year, Germany's leading company drives off the side into the red to the tune of some DM2bn when its profit and loss account is translated into the lingo of the American bean-counters. Enter stage left the deus ex machina, Goldman's London-based German analyst Timothy Plaut and his chorus. All of a sudden, Daimler's cleansing begins, with the 'crisis' illuminated as 'the sole prerequisite for renewal'. Steeped in the corporate culture of a country where high-flown rhetoric is far from unusual, Plaut may have overestimated his audience's erudition this time around. Or does he believe US fund managers would be safer reading Aristotle's Poetics than Daimler's accounts?</p>

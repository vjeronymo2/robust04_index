			<p><P> July 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: COMING ATTRACTIONS  </P> <P> Although there are several holidays between now and then, Hallmark Cards has  already booked the pre-Valentine's Day show for its "Hallmark Hall of Fame" on  CBS. It will be "Face to Face," a romantic drama starring Elizabeth Montgomery  and Robert Foxworth as two strong-willed people who fall in love in spite of  themselves. The film was shot on location in Kenya. A Hallmark executive notes  that the slot is important for the company because Valentine's Day is the  second most popular greeting-card occasion of the year, behind Christmas.

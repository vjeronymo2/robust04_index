			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Yaounde, 22 Feb (AFP) -- The entire Cameroonian  media today accused Nigeria of causing the escalation at both  countries' border. After the government daily CAMEROON TRIBUNE  denounced Nigeria's "ambitions" yesterday, the national  television in the evening devoted a special program to the tense  situation on the Bakassi Peninsula, stating that Cameroon was  within its right. The television bases its stand on the  communique issued at the weekend in which Cameroon announced  that Nigerian units had attacked some Cameroonian positions on  islands belonging to it.    For their part, two independent weeklies, LE MESSAGER and LA  NOUVELLE EXPRESSION, close to the opposition, denounced  "Nigerian expansionistic bids." In an editorial published  yesterday and headed "The duty of solidarity," LE MESSAGER,  referring to "the illegal occupation of a part of the  Cameroonian territory," stated that Nigerians "were not naive."    "The 18 February attack shows to what extent they are  determined to snatch from us this part of our territory, but our  Armed Forces' reaction further demonstrated that the search for  dialogue, which we have always supported, did not rule out the  use of force to react to force," the newspaper continues,  writing straightforwardly: "War has started."    For its part, LA NOUVELLE EXPRESSION, today devoted to the  event its editorial headed: "To the front" in which it calls on  Cameroonian President Paul Biya to summon "all the Cameroonian  political leaders worthy of this name to discuss this issue with  all of them, now that the troops need high morale to resist the  Nigerian aggressor."</p>

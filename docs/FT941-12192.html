			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Commercial radio gains ground Commercial radio continued to take listeners from the BBC in the last quarter of 1993, according to research jointly funded by the BBC and commercial radio, published today. The figures show that commercial radio had 487,000 more listeners a week in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter, while the BBC's figure fell by 633,000. For 1993, commercial radio's audience share rose from 37.7 per cent to 42.8 per cent. Total BBC radio 'reach' - the number of listeners who tune in for at least five minutes in the course of an average week - stood at the end of 1993 at 30.4m, or 65 per cent of the adult population. The figure for all commercial stations was 26.5m, or 57 per cent of the population.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bissau, 11 May (ANG/PANA) -- A presidential decree  issued in Bissau today announced that the country's first  multiparty presidential and parliamentary elections will be held  on 3 July.    The decree stated that President Joao Bernardo Vieira chose  that date following the proposal by the National Electoral  Commission to hold the elections between 26 June and 10 July.  The elections were initially scheduled for 27 March, but were  postponed.    The announcement of the new election date comes a day after  the Electoral Commission published the official and final  electoral list of 404,521 voters. Bissau, which has 97,520  voters, represents nearly a quarter of the electorate. This  gives it the right to have 20 parliamentarians.    Thirteen parties, including 12 opposition parties, have  already begun their campaigns, while two other parties -- the  Socialist Party and the National Convention -- await  legalization. Six candidates, all of whom are from the  opposition, have already joined the presidential race. Their  main objective is to defeat President "Nino" Vieira, 60, who  came to power on 14 November 1980, as well as his party, the  African Party for the Independence of Guinea-Bissau and Cape  Verde [PAIGC], which led the country to independence on 10  September 1974.    Aboubacar Djalo, leader of the Ecological Protection League,  is the candidate for the "Union for Change," which is a  coalition of six parties including the Democratic Front, the  Democratic and Social Front, the United Movement for  Development, the Party for the People's Development, the Party  for Renovation and Development, and the Ecological Protection  League.    Other presidential aspirants are current President Joao  Bernardo Vieira, PAIGC chairman; Domingos Fernandes Gomes, the  Guinea-Bissau Resistance-Bafata Movement leader; Victor Saude  Maria, chairman of the United Social Democratic Party; and Kumba  Iala, leader of the Party for Social Renovation. Francois  Kankoila Mendy, leader of the Guinea-Bissau National Liberation  Front, and Carlos Domingos Gomes, an independent candidate  backed by the Party for Democratic Convergence, are also in the  race. It is the country's first multiparty election since  independence.</p>

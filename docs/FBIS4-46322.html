			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Nick Watt and Christopher Elliott: "Queen's </F> Schedule Obtained by IRA "]    [Text] Irish special branch detectives hunting IRA  terrorists have found in a raid on a Dublin house documents  setting out the Queen's engagements and personal details of  senior British Army officers.    A six-month schedule of the Queen's engagements was listed  as  well as details of the officers' addresses, telephone numbers  and car registrations, according to reports in a Dublin  newspaper.    Police on both sides of the Irish Sea were playing down the  significance of the documents last night, as some information is  understood to be old. However, Special Branch officers at  Scotland Yard were liaising with their Irish counterparts last  night.    Irish police confirmed yesterday that sensitive documents  were found during a raid last week on a house used by the IRA in  Dublin.    A spokesman for the Garda said: "We can confirm that we  found  certain materials in a raid on a house on the north side of the  city. Owing to security matters we can't discuss any further."    Attempts to make the Queen a priority target would mark a  departure in IRA policy. Any attack on the sovereign would  inevitably bring a backlash in Great Britain and Ireland and a  profoundly adverse reaction abroad, especially in America.    However, as reported in The Times yesterday, the  most recent list to cause serious concern to the police and MI5,  found two weeks before the mortar attack on Heathrow, included a  number of fresh targets. It appears that a a number of sites  associated with the royal family may have been detailed.    Hundreds of MPs, judges, senior civil servants and other  Establishment figures have been put on a high level of alert.    Intelligence suggests that the IRA is looking for another  spectacular terrorist incident in the wake of their Easter  ceasefire and their rejection of the Downing Street declaration.</p>

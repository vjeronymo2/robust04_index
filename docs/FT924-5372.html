			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Denmark plans spending boost THE DANISH government has announced an expansionary budget programme for 1993, stressing job creation and investment in infrastructure. The announcement follows long negotiations between the partners in the coalition government and other centre parties. Prime Minister Poul Schluter's Conservative Party has had to make substantial concessions in its efforts to reduce unemployment and other welfare benefits. The Social Democrats, in particular, had criticised the government's original budget plans, outlined in August, for not giving enough stress to creating jobs. The agreement between six of Denmark's eight parties was also hastened by a desire to put on a show of economic unity after last week's devaluation of the Swedish krona. The government has agreed to find an extra DKr500m (Pounds 53m) for construction projects, including road building, railways, sewerage and housing. It says this should create at least 25,000 jobs. However, the minister of finance, Mr Henning Dyremose, said he would still be able to reduce the budget deficit from the latest forecast of DKr40bn for 1992, which is DKr12bn more than budgeted. Mr Dyremose forecast that the economy would grow by 2 per cent in 1993 compared with 1 per cent in 1992.</p>

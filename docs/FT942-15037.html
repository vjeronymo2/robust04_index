			<p>940418 FT  18 APR 94 / Seeking an impossible peace: From inside an armoured personnel carrier - A look at the South African army's task in a black township's war zone Major Julius Lloyd has no illusions about the impossibility of his task: to bring peace to the black township of Umlazi outside Durban, under the state of emergency imposed in South Africa's Natal province ahead of next week's elections. The major is providing a guided tour - by armoured personnel carrier - of the dismal shacks and 'matchbox' houses which cling precariously to the steep green hillsides of the township. Imperceptibly, we cross the front line of the Umlazi war zone, from an African National Congress neighbourhood where men sit outside drinking and women hanging laundry, to an identical Inkatha Freedom party area, where life goes on in much the same way. All that changes is the facial expressions: in ANC areas, where Maj Lloyd and his 41st Parachute Brigade troops are welcomed as peacemakers, there is a smile on almost every pair of lips; in Inkatha areas, where the troops are seen as an occupying army of the ANC, an averted glance, pointed indifference, sometimes open hostility. Maj Lloyd stands in the machine gunner's turret of one of the 'Casspir' armoured personnel carriers used to patrol Umlazi day and night, and reflects on the futility of using South African Defence Force troops to try to solve what is overwhelmingly a political problem in Natal. 'We come into a place, always with a big force, and all we do is suppress the violence. But the violence is just waiting for us to leave again. It's all just waiting to pop up again,' says the man who commands the 'parabats' (short for parachute battalion), a veteran of similar operations in the warring East Rand townships near Johannesburg. His troops have succeeded in restoring short-term stability in the two weeks since their deployment under the state of emergency. Public transport has returned after a violence-induced stoppage, and 'the children play in the streets again'. Indeed, they are out in force as we patrol the township in the brown SADF Casspir, begging for sweets from the soldiers' 'rat (ration) packs'. The troops have seized a number of illegal arms, at roadblocks and with the aid of tip-offs. But the scale of the problem is vast: Maj Lloyd reckons everybody in Umlazi has at least one firearm; and though nobody really knows how many live in its densely packed 50 square kilometres, most estimates top 200,000. Maj Lloyd believes both sides simply buried their arms caches when the SADF arrived, and will unearth them once it, inevitably, leaves again. He says the perpetrators are careful to ensure that the areas where arms are stashed are kept free of violence, to avoid attracting the attention of the security forces. Any big operation to unearth caches - whether in the townships or the Inkatha-controlled hostel - does not seem to be on his immediate agenda. The SADF is still able to pick up firearms, mostly homemade, at roadblocks: because homemade arms are easier to conceal (until assembled, they simply look like lengths of pipe), people do not bother to bury them. But factory-made arms are largely kept out of circulation. Maj Lloyd recognises that the SADF's popularity might wane if it started raiding ANC arms caches and putting ANC 'self-defence units' out of action. Instead, the troops are universally popular in ANC areas because they are viewed as fairer than the South African Police's Internal Stability Division (riot police) and the police force of the KwaZulu homeland, of which Umlazi forms part. Both are accused of siding with Inkatha, and even participating in Inkatha raids on ANC areas. With the troops around to prevent possible bias in the security forces, and to discourage fighting, stability can probably be guaranteed around polling time. Those who wish to vote in the April 26-28 election will do so in relative safety. But Maj Lloyd is less sanguine about the long-term prospects for peace: 'The tensions that exist will continue to exist after the elections,' he notes. 'Once we leave an area, it stays quiet for a week or two then it starts again.' But South Africa's politicians regularly ignore this kind of message from the military: that troops are no more than a short-term palliative for the problem of Natal. Without the use of huge numbers of troops - beyond the capacity of the SADF to provide - the Natal conflict simply cannot be crushed. Thick bush, irregular terrain, densely packed housing, all make it difficult to pursue suspects whom the community wishes to hide. Only politicians, not armoured cars, can penetrate this morass; if they do not do so, Umlazi's fragile stability could yet prove only short-lived.</p>

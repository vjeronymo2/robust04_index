			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Serge Arnold] </F>   [Excerpts] Nairobi, May 10 (AFP) -- Rebels turned up the  heat on increasingly battered government forces desperately  struggling to hold back the guerrillas' final offensive on the  Rwandan capital Tuesday [10 May].    "Kigali will fall within a week," a UN military official  predicted as rebels pounded a government camp near the airport  with a heavy barrage of mortar and artillery fire, blowing up an  ammunition depot. "The army is in increasing disarray and many  soldiers are deserting," said the official, who requested  anonymity. [passage omitted]    Gunners of the Hutu-led army have relentlessly shelled rebel  headquarters at the former parliament building since Tuesday.  Military officials of the United Nations said the government  forces were "very much on the defensive". Heavy fighting also  raged around the northwestern town of Ruhengeri and in Bugesera,  south of the capital, UN spokesman Abdul Kabia said.    General Romeo Dallaire, the Canadian commander of the 400  remaining UN soldiers in Rwanda, drove across the battle lines  in an armoured personnel carrier for separate meetings with  rebel leaders and army officers in a bid to broker a ceasefire  Tuesday.    In Geneva, Canada called on the UN Commission on Human  Rights  to hold a special session to discuss developments in Rwanda.    Paul Dubois, Canadian acting permanent representative to the  commission, stated: "We believe effective action to prevent  further human rights violations must be a central element of the  overall UN response to the tragedy in Rwanda."    UN spokeswoman Therese Gastaut said the new rights  commissioner, Jose Ayala Lasso was in Burundi, neighbouring  Rwanda, on Tuesday, seeking to obtain "impartial" information  from a wide range of sources, and hoped to go Wednesday to  Rwanda. A UN relief plane landed in Kigali on Tuesday after  fighting forced UN officials to turn back an aircraft Monday.    Aid agencies have criticised the world body for evacuating  most of its soldiers after 10 Belgian UN soldiers were killed in  the initial wave of bloodletting.    Pressure is mounting for an international military  intervention, but the rebels have warned that they will treat  foreign forces as hostile invaders.    Dallaire was to put ceasefire proposals to both sides within  48 hours. [passage omitted]    The UN High Commissioner for Refugees appealed Tuesday for  56.7 million dollars in aid to assist 860,000 people who have  fled Rwanda.    "We are facing a refugee catastrophe unless enough food,  clean water, shelter and sanitation are provided to the refugees  packed into the Banako camp in Tanzania," UNHCR spokesman Ron  Redmond said.    Philippe Gaillard of the International Red Cross said that  the government's estimate that 2.5 million Rwandans were  displaced was "not very far off the mark" but that fighting had  prevented aid workers from reaching many of them.    The Catholic aid group Caritas estimates that the bloodbath  has put two million people at risk of famine in Rwanda and  Burundi, which shares Rwanda's history of bitter feuds between  the majority Hutus and the Tutsis, who form about 15 percent of  the population in both countries.</p>

			<p><P> November 26, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DENVER AIRPORT FIRE STILL BURNS, IS LESS INTENSE  </P> <P> A blaze feeding off more than 1.6 million gallons of jet fuel burned unchecked  at Stapleton International Airport today but appeared to diminish in intensity  as two of three ruptured tanks burned themselves out.  </P> <P> Fears that a fourth tank, which had sprung a leak and was buckling, might  rupture eased by late morning.  </P> <P> "Things are going real, real good. The intensity has dropped dramatically,"  said Fire Department spokesman Nick Nuanes, adding that firefighters are moving  closer to the tanks as the intensity tapers off.  </P> <P> Flight delays caused by a fuel shortage wrenched thousands of travelers  hurrying home from their Thanksgiving visits Sunday, but replacement fuel is  being trucked in today to make up for the fuel lost in the blaze.  </P> <P> The blaze erupted Sunday morning and engulfed two tanks containing 400,000  gallons of fuel each. It exploded from huge to gigantic later that night when  an 800,000-gallon tank became overheated, ruptured and ignited.  </P> <P> The two smaller tanks largely burned themselves out today, but the  800,000-gallon tank continued to burn. Fire officials said the tank contains  enough fuel to burn until about midday Wednesday.  </P> <P> A fourth tank containing 350,000 gallons of fuel was leaking fuel from the  bottom and the fuel was erupting into flames, but the tank was not expected to  rupture as authorities had feared earlier. In all, the tank farm contains 12  tanks.  </P> <P> The Sunday after Thanksgiving traditionally is Stapleton's busiest day of the  year. The tanks had been filled Saturday night in anticipation of heavy holiday  air traffic, officials said.  </P> <P> The fire caused flight delays, because of refueling difficulties, and traffic  jams. Stapleton is the nation's fourth-busiest airport in terms of passenger  volume.  </P></p>

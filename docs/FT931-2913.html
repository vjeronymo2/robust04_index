			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Premier moves ahead to Pounds 16.8m PREMIER Consolidated Oilfields lifted pre-tax profits for the 12 months to December 31 to Pounds 16.8m. The outcome fell at the top end of analysts' expectations and the share price firmed 1p to 30 1/2 p. The result compared with Pounds 9.64m for the previous nine months period. The company's oil production reached a peak of 13,888 barrels a day as increased output at the Wytch Farm onshore oilfield and the Angus field in the North Sea came on stream. Turnover amounted to Pounds 56m, including Pounds 53.2m from the UK; the comparative figure was Pounds 32m, of which Pounds 29.9m was in the UK. Earnings per share were 2.9p against 1.72p. There is again no dividend but a 1-for-20 scrip issue is proposed. 'Our cash flow is quite robust,' said Mr Charles Jamieson, chief executive, but he added that the company had decided not to pay a cash dividend for two reasons: the penalty it could incur on advance corporation tax, which it doesn't pay, and the need to fund future exploration. He pointed to three developments that will add 45m barrels of oil equivalent (which includes gas) to the company's reserves over the next three years: the development of offshore drilling at Wytch Farm, the Fife oilfield in the North Sea and the Qadirpur field in Pakistan.</p>

			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Increase in ethical concerns reported Ethical concerns about products are set to follow environmental issues as a growing preoccupation for UK consumers, says a study by Mintel, the market research company. A marked rise in consumers' awareness of ethical matters in their spending bears all the hallmarks of the rising concern about 'green' issues of the early 1990s, Mintel says. Awareness is most marked in customers of financial services, with 47 per cent of those asked saying they would not use any financial service  - bank or building society account, credit card or investment  - from a particular company because of an ethical issue. That is 2 percentage points higher than in the previous study in 1990. The research also points to growing consumer concern about the ethics of manufacturing companies. The proportion of consumers who acknowledge they care about ethical issues, but have not yet adjusted their spending accordingly, rose by 7 percentage points to 35 per cent. Miss Angela Hughes, Mintel consumer research manager, says concern about company ethics is still concentrated on younger and better-educated consumers, notably from the south of England.

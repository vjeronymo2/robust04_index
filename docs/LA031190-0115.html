			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALTRANS  </P> <P> On Feb. 18, my wife and I drove Highway 395 north from San Bernardino to Carson  City, Nev.  </P> <P> Many of your readers, especially the skiers, will remember this as one of the  days of the heavy storms.  </P> <P> I would like to take this opportunity to publicly applaud the efforts of  Caltrans during that weekend. This often maligned organization appeared to have  worked all through Saturday night and into Sunday in order to keep the roads  clear. Proof of their performance is the fact that we drove the entire distance  without the need for tire chains.  </P> <P> STEVEN SMITH  </P> <P> Costa Mesa  </P></p>

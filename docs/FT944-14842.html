			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / US-N Korea nuclear pact North Korea's mission in Geneva today will host the signing of the nuclear pact with the US, completed earlier this week. The pact, hailed by President Bill Clinton as presaging the isolated communist country's full entry into the world community, was earlier formally endorsed by the North's new leader, Kim Jong-il. The ceremony will formalise an emerging relationship between Washington and Pyongyang, committing the North to improve ties with South Korea. Under the deal, North Korea freezes, then dismantles its current nuclear programme in return for a pledge of compensation in the form of oil for lost energy, and delivery over the next few years of new and safer nuclear plant.</p>

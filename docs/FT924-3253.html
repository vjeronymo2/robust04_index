			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Hungary buys US military hardware THE US has agreed to supply military hardware to bolster Hungary's air defences following repeated breaches by jets from neighbouring Yugoslavia. The arms sale, the first by the US to a former Warsaw Pact nation, involves 'identification-friend-or-foe' (IFF) equipment and is worth Dollars 12.9m (Pounds 8.4m). Under the deal US suppliers will deliver four ground-based radar stations and electronics for 118 military aircraft. The equipment will allow the Hungarian air force to leave the IFF system inherited from the communist Warsaw Pact and to distinguish the country's own planes from those of former allies. Hungary's need for firmer air defences became apparent a year ago when war in Yugoslavia spilled over the border and a series of territorial violations culminated in Yugoslav aircraft bombing the southern Hungarian town of Barcs. The agreement also demonstrates Hungary's success in establishing close security ties with Washington in advance of eventual membership of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, Budapest's goal. The purchase from the US comes within a month of deals for military spare parts from Germany and Russia. Hungary maintains its military acquisitions are defensive and do not change the regional balance of power, which remains strongly in favour of the country's neighbours. Sikorsky, the US-based helicopter manufacturer, yesterday signed a Dollars 1.1bn deal with Turkey for the sale and co-production of Black Hawk helicopters, AP reports from Ankara. Sikorsky will deliver 45 helicopters to Turkey in nine months, and a further 50 helicopters will be co-produced in Turkey over four years. Turkey, which has been stepping up efforts to modernise its military, will also receive 50 A-10 fighter aircraft and 100 Cobra helicopters from the US over the next five years.</p>

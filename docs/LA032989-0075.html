			<p><P> March 29, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Citing an $11-million debt, Ross Valley Medical Clinic in Greenbrae has filed  for bankruptcy protection. Administrators said the outpatient center, one of  Northern California's largest private clinics, will remain open while Chapter  11 organization plans are created to cut costs and pay creditors. "What we are  trying to do is take an ongoing losing situation and streamline it, clean it  up, do whatever it takes to make it a viable place," said Don Lass, the  clinic's administrator. Lass said the clinic moved into the red when it spent  about $6 million on three nearly simultaneous expansion projects earlier in the  decade.  </P></p>

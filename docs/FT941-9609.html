			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / Leading Article: Lining the executive nest It has not been a great weekend for British capitalism. On Friday night, British Aerospace confirmed the widely reported departure of its chairman, Mr John Cahill, with a laughably inadequate explanation of why he was leaving less than half way through a five-year contract: 'This is an appropriate moment for him to relinquish the chairmanship to allow him to spend more time . . .' and so on and so forth. No mention here of the widely discussed confrontations with his fellow executives, or of his potential profits on stock options estimated at Pounds 3.2m. Yet this huge reward raises questions, not only about British Aerospace, but also about managerial incentives in British business. Yesterday, an analysis in The Mail on Sunday added to the view that company executives find it too easy to line their own nests. Immediately after the privatisation of the regional electricity companies - at share prices which were designed to attract buyers - directors were granted stock options which are now falling due, and which will reportedly bring them profits of some Pounds 18m. Rewards on this scale may be appropriate for entrepreneurs in high-risk businesses or new start-ups. They seem out of place in an established regional utility. In Anglo-Saxon corporate culture, the performance of companies tends, for better or worse, to be closely identified with the individuals at their helm, who are often rewarded accordingly. This must at least in part be because they are freer from the controls imposed on German or Japanese companies by supervisory boards, or from the direct power exercised by stakeholders, such as the banks or other large shareholders. There are plenty of examples in the US and the UK to show that such freedom can be abused. Roulette In a report on today's management page, Lucy Kellaway suggests that executive share options have more to do with roulette than with rationality  -and, it might be added, the game is played with very favourable odds. According to a survey published today, most shareholders agree that existing schemes are flawed, in that executives stand to gain in a rising market, no matter how poor their company's relative performance may have been. So far, investing institutions have had great difficulty in agreeing sensible benchmarks of company performance which should determine the value of stock options for individual directors. M&amp;G, the unit trust group, argued recently that such benchmarks were inappropriate anyway, in that they could be distorted by accounting changes and lead managers to massage short-term profits, in order to boost the value of their options. That would seem to be an argument for doing away with such rewards altogether. Reuters has devised, as an alternative, a restricted share scheme, whereby the better the company performs, the more shares its directors receive. Disapproval In the end, stock options and more general questions about the overall level of executive remuneration must be a matter for shareholders to resolve. There are welcome signs that they are taking this task more seriously - a five-year contract of the type signed by Mr Cahill in 1992 would probably meet with their disapproval in today's climate. At the least, there is a need for greater transparency of the value of incentives granted, including options. The Financial Accounting Standards Board has stirred up a hornets' nest in the US by proposing tough new disclosure standards. That is no reason for not getting on with the job in the UK. Given the potential conflict of interest between the managers of an enterprise and its owners, all incentives schemes need full and thorough justification. Once schemes are made sufficiently transparent, public opinion has a role to play as well. The main threat to the political legitimacy of British capitalism would be a widespread perception that those who run it are, at best, unduly greedy. A climate of opinion that condemns out of hand schemes able to reward managers regardless of their individual performance is in the best interests not only of companies and their shareholders, but of the capitalist system as a whole.</p>

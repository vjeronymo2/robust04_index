			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / International Company News: Christiania Bank fails to agree public offer terms CHRISTIANIA BANK, Norway's second biggest bank, has failed to reach agreement with the government, its principal shareholder, on the terms for a public offering of new shares. The terms of the issue were expected to be announced yesterday when the bank published its nine-month result. Christiania said nine-month net profits of NKr566m (Dollars 77m), against losses of NKr785m last year, were helped by low interest rates and gains on securities and foreign exchange. Net interest income rose to NKr2.36bn from NKr2.29bn as non-interest income  -gains on securities, foreign exchange, and fees - increased to NKr1.76bn from NKr997m. Operating profit, before loan losses and write-downs, rose to NKr1.99bn from NKr1.16bn. Write-offs rose by NKr82m to NKr124m as losses on loans and guarantees were cut by NKr624m to NKr1.24bn. Analysts and government officials say the bank will seek to raise up to NKr2bn, but Christiania refuses to be drawn on details of the offering until the plans are finalised. The launch of the offering is being held back until bank officials can reach agreement with the state over pricing of the new shares. 'What we have is a difference of perspectives concerning the pricing of the new shares. The bank would like to be in a position to give a decent return on capital invested while the owner would like to make sure they don't give the bank away,' a Christiania official said yesterday. The state owns all but 9.2 per cent which is in the hands of 6,500 private shareholders. It took control in October 1991 after Christiania was declared technically insolvent and has made a series of cash injections. The privately-owned shares are traded outside the Oslo bourse at about NKr17 a share. Analysts say the pricing of the new shares could range anywhere from NKr6 to NKr16 each. They forecast the bank will make an initial issue and seek a listing in an attempt to improve its market valuation before a second tranche is launched. Christiania said it would be natural to expand the bank's foreign ownership quota to the legal limit of 33.3 per cent from 23.6 per cent. Mr Borger Lenth, Christiania's president, said the bank will release details of the offering as soon as a number of outstanding issues relating to terms and pricing are agreed between state and bank officials.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "sch": "Job Cuts To Continue in 1994"] </F>   [Text] Nuremberg, 24 Feb -- The economy in western Germany  expects a further 2-percent reduction in employment between the  middle of 1993 and the middle of 1994. This absolute reduction  of 580,000 employees will, however, not increase unemployment by  the same percentage, because retirements, hidden reserves, and  domestic policy measures will partly compensate for the job  losses.    This is the result of a sample inquiry by the Institute for  Labor Market and Occupational Research and Infratest Social  Research on "employment trends," which was carried out for the  first time in the middle of 1993 in 4,500 enterprises and public  administrative bodies. Still, employment will not decrease in  all branches and sizes of enterprises, and not in all 1.6  million enterprises in western Germany by the middle of 1994,  Bernhard Jagoda, president of the Federal Labor Office, said in  a news conference.    According to his statements, 175,000 enterprises, which  account for almost one-third of all employees, are intending to  reduce their staff by 0.95 million by the middle of 1994. At  the same time, 230,000 enterprises, which offer one-seventh of  all jobs, are planning to increase their work force by 0.44  million. Approximately three-quarters of all enterprises  accounting for more than half of all employees are expecting  stable employment figures by the middle of 1994.    Enterprises with decreasing employment exist in all  branches.  With the exception of credit institutions, insurance companies,  the liberal professions, and regional and local authorities, the  share of enterprises that expect their employment figures rather  to diminish is over 10 percent. Losses are particularly high in  the agricultural sector, the manufacturing industry, and the  health sector.    The slump in employment has mainly been caused by staff  reductions in large enterprises. Enterprises with a work force  of more than 5,000 intend to employ 11 percent fewer employees  than in the middle of 1992. Hopes regarding employment have to  be pinned especially on small enterprises. Small enterprises  with up to 50 employees in the service sector is the group that  least has to expect job cuts in 1994.    In his news conference, Jagoda stated that a massive  reduction of jobs alone will not solve the problems of the  enterprises. The willingness to be innovative and the ability  to modernize structures will be increasingly important for a  positive economic and employment development and the securing of  economic centers and jobs. Here, the survey produced the  following result: On an average, 26 percent of the enterprises  stated that they improved and further developed their products  in the past two years. This rate rises to 58 percent in the  case of enterprises with more than 500 employees. Regardless of  enterprise size, an average 25 percent of enterprises added new  products or services to their offer for which there is already a  market. Eleven percent of all enterprises developed completely  new products and services, for which a new market has to first  be created. All in all, 40 percent of enterprises in western  Germany made one of the above-mentioned innovative efforts in  the past two years.    Despite the general reduction of jobs, there is still a  significant offer of vacancies. A total of 260,000 enterprises,  or more than one-sixth of all, was looking for a total of  492,000 workers in mid-1993 for employment as early as possible.  A total of 187 [number as published] enterprises wanted to  increase their work force by 347,000 people at a later time.  Jagoda complained that only about one-third of these vacancies  were reported to the labor offices, seizing the opportunity to  plead for closer trusting cooperation between enterprises and  the labor offices in the future. About half of the entire offer  were vacancies for skilled workers, and more than one-third for  qualified employees. A total of 8 percent of all enterprises in  western Germany did not find applicants for their vacancies.</p>

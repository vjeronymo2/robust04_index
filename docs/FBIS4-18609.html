			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "EU Referendum on 12 June -- Accession </F> Not Possible Before March 1996?"]    [Text] Vienna -- Dates were fixed in the Council of  Ministers yesterday [6 April]: The referendum on the European  Union [EU] membership is to be held on 12 June. Due to the  ratification process, EU entry could be delayed until 1996.    The coalition and parliamentary leaders have now agreed on  an EU accession schedule: The EU Accession Act is to be passed  by parliament on 5 or 6 May, and it will be made subject to a  referendum on 12 June -- not on 19 June, the alternative date  that had been discussed.    Government circles say that the actual entry could be  delayed  until March 1996 due to the ratification process in the other  countries. Vienna is not unhappy about this, these circles said  yesterday. Any delay decreases compensation payments to be made  to Austrian agriculture from public funds.    Negotiations on these compensation payments are proving most  difficult. Time is running out: A decisive round of talks  between government representatives, social partners, and  representatives from the provinces has been scheduled for  Tuesday [12 April]. As has been reported, the demands made on  the government are in the double-digit  billion-Austrian-schillings range.    Chancellor Franz Vranitzky said yesterday that the parties'  agreement on Austria's accompanying measures to EU entry should  be concluded by Friday next week.</p>

			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Charity cash 'has life-saving role' in NHS CHARITABLE fund-raising has assumed a 'life-saving role' in the National Health Service, Directory of Social Change says today. The voluntary sector agency claims in a report that charity is being called on to finance capital projects and basic services, and says: 'Many hospital appeals now stress that, if not enough money is raised, lives will be lost'. A consensus that charity should not finance services which were the proper responsibility of the state has 'all but collapsed,' says the report. Basic services which had been supported include building developments; equipping special-care baby units; keeping operating theatres open; providing life-support machines and cardiac monitors, fitting ambulances with resuscitation equipment and training their crews. More than 2,300 charitable funds for hospitals are now registered with the Charity Commission - five times the pre-1980 level. The report estimates that total charitable income in the NHS is Pounds 370m a year. Charitable assets held by health authorities and self-governing trust hospitals are worth Pounds 693m, says the report. The report says that hospitals' growing reliance on charitable income may have a number of implications in the internal market introduced under government health reforms. One possibility, says the report, is that successful charitable appeals could lead to a reduction in state finance for hospitals. Charity and NHS Reform.

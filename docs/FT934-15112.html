			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / International Company News: Honda and Isuzu to extend agreement HONDA and Isuzu are to extend their product-sharing relationship, further highlighting the pressure on Japanese carmakers to curb development costs. Honda will supply Isuzu with a version of its popular Accord to be sold under the Isuzu badge in Japan, and with its Domani model for sale in Thailand. Isuzu will supply Honda with its Big Horn recreational vehicle, which Honda will sell under its own marque. The exchange extends an agreement reached earlier this year. Under that agreement Honda already provides Isuzu with its Domani, which Isuzu sells in Japan, while Isuzu will provide Honda with two types of recreational vehicle, the Rodeo and Mu, for sale in the US and Japan respectively. The arrangement will help the companies to utilise their capacity better during one of the worst recessions the Japanese car industry has faced, as well as extend their product ranges. The market for recreational vehicles has been growing strongly in Japan, but Honda has been left behind because of a lack of models. Isuzu, meanwhile, has pulled out of passenger car production and relies on products supplied by other manufacturers to complement its range. The decision by Honda and Isuzu to rely on other carmakers to provide them with models reflects the dilemma faced by the Japanese car industry. While carmakers need to supply their dealers with a wide range of products, overcapacity in the market and the urgent need to cut costs has limited their ability to develop a full range of models, not all of which would sell in high volumes. Although Honda and Isuzu will be competing with each other in the Japanese market for sales of the cars they are to supply each other, such competition was not a significant concern since the two companies' dealers have very different customer bases, Honda said. The two companies are exploring the possibility of further product exchanges. Any further extension depends on 'whether Isuzu has anything more to offer', Honda added.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The important Cuba-Netherlands bilateral meeting for  trade relations began in this capital today at the Hotel  Comodoro at 1500. I say important meeting because the  businessmen from the Netherlands are accompanied by a trade  mission from 22 companies, which will study at first hand the  possibilities of investing in the construction of waterworks and  port facilities, in the textile industry, and in food products.  Also present are representatives from important financial banks  and legal assistance. According to the chairman of the Dutch  party, Wuliam Want Waut [identified by caption], the objective  is to activate this group after years of regrettable immobility.    [Begin Wuliam Want Waut recording, in English with  superimposed translation into Spanish] The only problem is that  they need time. This is a characteristic of the Dutch. They need  time to study things in depth. However, we expect very good  results from this visit. [end recording]    The Netherlands is an important trading partner for Cuba,  one  whose exchange value over the past three years exceeded $50  million; they have, in Cuba, such prestigious companies as  Castrol, and they trade in areas as vital as nickel. Indeed,  thanks to the work of this bilateral group, a Dutch bank  extended credit to Cuba's nickel and sugar industries, although  Cuban representative (Ariel Maso) says there are other fields,  too.    This group will be making bilateral contacts until Friday  [25  March], when the individual and collective results of the  negotiations will be learned. Businessmen from both countries  can rely on a market that is needful and almost virgin and, in  addition, has the corresponding financing -- apparently all the  links to allow the economy to benefit.    [Havana Radio Rebelde Network in Spanish at 0000 GMT on 22  March says in a similar report: "Some 20 businessmen make up the  Netherlands trade mission which today began exchanges aimed at  identifying the host's new interests that might be attractive to  the visitors. Marta Camacho, secretary general of the Chamber of  Commerce of the Republic of Cuba, welcomed the delegation, which  is headed by (Juan F. Stor), former Netherlands ambassador to  Havana.    "The meeting is being held at the Comorodo Hotel and will  last until next Friday [25 March].    "The Dutch mission is made up mainly of representatives of  firms involved in waterworks and port facility construction, the  agricultural industry, providers of food products, the textile  industry, banking institutions, and the legal assistance field."]</p>

			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / Tourists find improved value The number of foreign tourists who believe that Britain offers good value for money rose last year following sterling's devaluation, but dissatisfaction with the cost of hotels remained high, a survey published today shows. The British Tourist Authority's annual survey of foreign visitors found that French and Italian visitors were more dissatisfied than tourists of other nationalities with Britons' inability to speak foreign languages. The survey found that 55 per cent of visitors last year thought London public transport provided good value, compared with 50 per cent in 1992. Prices in shops won the approval of 47 per cent, compared with 35 per cent in 1992. Meals were regarded as good value by 42 per cent, compared with only 28 per cent in 1992. Hotel accommodation outside London won the approval of only 21 per cent, however, up from 19 per cent in 1992. London hotels were regarded as good value by 17 per cent, compared with 12 per cent in 1992. Western European visitors who did not speak English expressed high levels of dissatisfaction with the foreign language abilities of officials and staff in the facilities they visited. Non-English-speaking visitors from other countries, on the other hand, were generally happy with the foreign language abilities of staff and officials. The BTA said: 'Increasing European integration is probably making west European visitors less tolerant of the British lack of linguistic ability than before.' Overseas Visitor Survey 1993.

Ten other agreemnts were also signed.    The framework agreement binds the two sides to build  relations as friendly nations and not to participate in any  blocs or alliances aimed against each other. It also provides  for bilateral consultations and appropriate measures if one of  the sides' interests or security is threatened.    Speaking before flying to Tbilisi, Yeltsin said the question  of the Russian parliament ratifying the treaty would be delayed  until a comprehensive solution to the conflicts in Abkhazia and  South Ossetia was found.    Opponents of the treaty, many of them Russian deputies, have  attacked some of its clauses saying the two sides will sign  further agreements to help Georgia set up its own army and  supply it with Russian-made weapons, military hardware and  technologies.    Other agreements signed by Russia's First Vice Premier Oleg  Soskovets and Georgian Prime Minister Otar Patsatsia are on  trade and economic cooperation for 1994; free trade; the status  of Russian border guards deployed in Georgia; international  roadway communications; cooperation in areas of science and  technology and communications; regulation of resettlement  processes and the protection of resettlers' rights; early  warning and elimination of emergency situations; and a protocol  on financing Russian border troops deployed in Georgia.    Cooperation agreements on cultural links, science and  education were signed by Foreign Ministers Andrey Kozyrev and  Aleksandr Chikvaidze.    Earlier in the day, Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev  and Chief of Staff of the Georgian Defense Ministry Guram  Nikolaishvili signed a protocol of intent providing for the  establishment of three Russian army bases in Georgia.</p>

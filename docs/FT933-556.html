			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (11): The man who beat the widow's curse - Economics AUSTIN ROBINSON: THE LIFE OF AN ECONOMIC ADVISER Sir Alec Cairncross St Martins Press Pounds 40 198 pages THIS BOOK has a strong flavour of autobiography. Sir Alec Cairncross has drawn heavily on Austin Robinson's personal papers, supplemented by long letters from him, commenting on the draft. Much of the best in the book comes from the horse's mouth. It is the story of one of the last of the great Cambridge economists who worked closely with Keynes between the wars. No theorist, Robinson's lasting contributions came mainly as an organiser, helping to found the Central Statistical Office, launching the International Economic Association, participating in the creation of the Overseas Development Institute, editing the Economic Journal for over a quarter of a century. He also flew the earliest flying boats, taught a juvenile Maharajah, and advised governments for over a decade. Drawn to Keynes' Cambridge circus (as it afterwards became known) Robinson made his mark by, among other things shattering the 'Widow's Curse' fallacy which had caught Keynes' imagination. This held that when a businessman made profits, those profits would not be depleted because by spending them they would force up prices, creating profits for other businessmen. Robinson is generally supposed to have been the one who pointed out that output might rise instead of prices. As he said: 'If an entrepreneur loaded with profits decided on his way home to have a shoe shine, was the effect solely to raise the price of shoe shines, rather than affect the number of shoes shone?' Although he contributed a good deal to the economic debates of his time, not least with his book Monopoly and early work on development economIcs, an interest stirred by two years in India and an extended visit to the Zambian Copper Belt, he has not left a clearly indelible mark on economic thought in the way that has his more theoretical wife, Joan. His gift was for rigorous analysis of a particular problem without recourse to an overarching theory but with the clear determination to find answers which could be translated into policy. So it is right that this book should be subtitled The Life of an Economic Adviser. It seems he first flirted with the idea of working in government as early as 1931. That came to nothing, and it was the war which brought him in. He was influential in the preparation of the first set of national accounts and heavily involved in translating lessons learnt from war-time planning into peace-time purposes. Robinson doubted that investment could be directed by price signals alone. Planning could regulate disequilibria 'by administrative and budgetary action and by control of investment, more quickly than would happen through the ordinary operations of the price mechanism'. In this, and in other ideas, such as his espousal of import controls and complacency about the sustainability of growth, he marched with the times. It is as a product of his times that some of his observations make entertaining reading. On a comparison of Indian and African servants: 'These (African) people are incredibly inept and noisy servants and clat around the room . . . in India where servants are perfect we say 'this is evidently a servile race. They can't rule themselves'; in South Africa we say 'these people can't even lay a table. How can they run a country?'' There is less about his wife than might have been expected. From the war time on it seems they lived apart in a large Cambridge house. We learn that this most famous of female economists 'slept, summer and winter, in the garden shed, which was open to the winds, while the tits lined their nests with her hair'. In spite of some repetition this is a useful guide to the atmosphere of inter-war and post-war intellectual economic life. It is not hagiography but a tribute, enlivened by the diaries and letters of the man himself.</p>

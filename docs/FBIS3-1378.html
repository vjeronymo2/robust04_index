The two delegations agreed to  review the prevailing situation in our country and to adopt an  official position on questions that are of interest to them,  with the aim of clarifying the statements which had led to  divergent interpretations in the past. The two delegations hope  that this initial joint communique will serve to clarify all the  dark spots and dissipate once and for all the doubts that might  still subsist in the minds of some people.    1. Concerning their relations, the CAR expresses regret for  any positions it adopted that might have disturbed its partners  in the UTD. The UTD, which took an active part in the  democratic struggle, solemnly reaffirms its unequivocal  adherence to the parliamentary majority. The CAR reaffirms its  desire to treat the UTD as a full partner, without which there  would be no parliamentary majority, and is determined not to  undertake anything on issues of common interest without prior  consultation. The UTD is determined to work in collaboration  with CAR for the triumph of democratic ideals, in line with the  wishes expressed by the people during the 6 and 20 February  legislative elections.    2. Concerning the leadership of the institutions, the UTD  confirms the terms of the 23 March letter, in which it affirmed  that the management of the people's victory must be done by  consensus, notably when there is a question of choosing  government and parliamentary posts. The UTD reaffirms that it  has no intention of vying for any of these posts without  reaching a prior understanding and consensus agreement with the  CAR.    Consequently the two sides agree to clarify those points  which might have led to divergent interpretations:    A. The CAR has officially chosen the post of prime minister.  The UTD rallies around this choice;    B. Concerning the name of the CAR activist who is to occupy  this post, official consultations have been held today between  the two parties, a name has been proposed, and the UTD sees no  inconvenience about this and accepts this choice;    C. Concerning the other posts, the same delegation will  continue with their consultations;    D. The two delegation have agreed to have more contacts in  order to harmonize their viewpoints on a permanent basis in line  with the wishes of the people;    E. The two delegations pledge to eschew their war of  communiques, media, and press attacks, either directly or  through the offices of a third party.    Issued, in Lome on 26 March.    Signed, for the CAR by Mr. Yaovi Agboyibor, and for the UTD  by Mr. Edem Kodjo.</p>

			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Strike to force cut at Australian smelter Australia's largest aluminium smelter, Tomago, is to close down one of its three potlines on Monday because of a strike, human resources manager Mr Graham Taylor said yesterday, reports Reuters from Sydney. Closure of the 160 pots in Potline Two at the smelter near Newcastle in New South Wales would reduce annual production by 80,000 tonnes to 260,000 tonnes. 'The decision was taken purely on health and welfare considerations for our staff who are keeping the other two potlines operating during the strike,' Mr Taylor said. On August 12 about 700 workers went on strike in support of a demand for an 8 per cent pay rise. Mr Taylor said the striking workers voted at a meeting yesterday to continue the stoppage indefinitely.</p>

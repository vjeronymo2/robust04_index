			<p>BFN     [Text] Our colleague, (Mwene Bukungu), reports that, from  Bugesera to Rwabusoro, the people all say the same thing:  Nothing will happen to us because the Rwandan Patriotic Front  [RPF] is already here. On the way to (Munya), after crossing a  bridge destroyed by government troops in an attempt to halt the  advance of the RPF, one finds that many people are returning to  their homes. Along the way, the bodies of government troops can  be seen on the tarmac. On the way to Nyanza, people say [words  indistinct]. They also say that they are happy that RPF troops  are in the area. People say they have (?seen) the discarded  military uniforms of government soldiers. One such found was  for a [name indistinct] Gaspard, No. 31173, who hails from  Kidaho commune, in the (Gisare) sector, Ruhengeri Prefecture.  He threw away his star, his shirt, trousers shoes, socks, and  fled. The people say that that is what the government troops  are doing.    In our efforts to rescue Rwandans, RPF troops have freed 800  prisoners, soldiers and civilians, who were jailed in Nyanza.  Up through last night, RPF soldiers have been attempting to  rescue people who had taken refuge in attics, where they are  still hiding. Operations are under way in Nyanza, whether in  (Mugangamure) or (Mugunzi). There are many injured people in  the hospitals.</p>

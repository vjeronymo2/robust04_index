			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / Stock market points to Kohl Growing confidence among investors that Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government would be re-elected on Sunday helped the German stock market to make further gains yesterday after earlier concern that the coalition might lose the vote. The DAX index of leading stocks in Frankfurt added a further 2.3 per cent, or 46.3 points, to reach 2,071 points after a rise of 3.3 per cent (64.2 points) on Monday. Also contributing to the continued upturn was the stronger performance in the bond market. Despite the positive German stock market showing, however, some economists still feel Chancellor Kohl could have an uphill struggle to win. 'I think his chances are slightly better than 50-50,' said Mr Holger Fahrinkrug, Frankfurt-based economist with UBS Global Research. This morning, he added, stock market opinion was probably tilting to a 55 per cent probability of a victory for Mr Kohl. Now, he thought, market opinion in favour of a Kohl success had probably strengthened to 60 per cent. A new opinion poll yesterday gave Chancellor Kohl and his coalition partners 50 per cent. The result in the poll by the Allensbach Institute was the coalition's best of recent weeks. It gave the CDU/CSU 42 per cent, 0.9 points up from a week earlier, with the FDP unchanged on 8 per cent. The SPD had slipped 0.2 points to 34.9 per cent. It gave the Greens 8.1 per cent, down 0.1, and the reformed communist Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS) 3.9 per cent, down 0.6. Recent opinion polls suggesting the governing coalition was likely to win an outright victory have helped market sentiment. So has confidence about the economic recovery and receding inflation, despite yesterday's news that west German inflation in September had stuck at 3 per cent instead of easing to an annual 2.9 per cent as provisionally stated.</p>

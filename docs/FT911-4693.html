			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / International Company News: Drug groups book higher earnings THE strength of the worldwide drugs industry was reflected in the the first-quarter results of Bristol-Myers Squibb and Warner Lambert which both yesterday reported higher earnings and sales. The groups were helped by improved drugs sales and the weakness of the dollar overseas. Bristol-Myers Squibb, the world's second-biggest drugs company which was formed after an Dollars 11.5bn merger in 1989, turned in a 20 per cent improvement in first-quarter net earnings on an 11 per cent improvement in sales. In the three months ended March, the New York-based company had net profits of Dollars 492.6m or 94 cents a share on sales of Dollars 2.73bn, compared with income of Dollars 409.1m or 78 cents on sales of Dollars 2.46bn a year earlier. Sales were helped by favourable foreign exchange translations, which contributed two percentage points to the improvement in the 1991 quarter. Earnings before taxes rose 18.4 per cent to Dollars 703.7m from Dollars 594.6m. Mr Richard Gelb, chairman and chief executive, said international sales in the 1991 quarter increased 14 per cent, compared with a 9 per cent improvement in domestic sales. Sales of pharmaceuticals and medical devices were particularly strong. Warner-Lambert, a US pharmaceuticals and non-prescription health products group, also reported strong first-quarter earnings. Net income grew 16 per cent to Dollars 139.5m or Dollars 1.04 a share from Dollars 100.3m or 90 cents a share in the first quarter of 1990. Sales rose 11 per cent to Dollars 1.22bn from Dollars 1.1bn. Excluding the benefits of foreign exchange translations, sales advanced 8 per cent in the latest quarter. During the 1991 first quarter, sales of Warner-Lambert's prescription pharmaceuticals went ahead by 17 per cent to Dollars 421m, led by Lopid, a cholesterol regulator, whose sales increased 45 per cent to Dollars 111m in the quarter. Sales of the company's non-prescription health care products rose 8 per cent to Dollars 383m in the latest quarter, led by Listerine antiseptic mouthwash and Halls cough tablets. Worldwide sales of gums and mints improved 3 per cent in the three months to Dollars 257m. Warner-Lambert is waiting for the Food &amp; Drug Administration to approve its Cognex drug to treat Alzheimer's disease. If the approval is forthcoming, analysts believe Cognex will make a substantial contribution to Warner-Lambert's earnings in the 1990s. The company recently submitted additional data on Cognex and new analysis of clinical data to the FDA.</p>

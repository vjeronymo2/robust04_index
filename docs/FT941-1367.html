			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Leading Article: The Pru plays hardball Mr Mick Newmarch, group chief executive of Britain's Prudential Corporation, has never made any secret of his disagreements with Mr Andrew Large, the head of the Securities and Investments Board (SIB). Yet his decision to shun the new Personal Investment Authority (PIA) and to request direct regulation for the Prudential's sales and marketing activities by the SIB is a snub on a gigantic scale. It comes with the full backing of the Prudential's board. It had been Mr Large's intention to run down the direct regulatory function of the SIB and to hand over the task to the PIA. He has also indicated clearly that an approach from the Pru or anyone else for direct regulation would not be welcome. Mr Newmarch's challenge is thus intentionally confrontational. It is also exceptionally blunt, since yesterday's press release from the Prudential concludes that 'direct regulation by the SIB will give us an enhanced opportunity to influence our regulatory environment'. In short, this is a hostile act of regulatory arbitrage, one of whose objects is to capture the regulator. In one sense, it is all posturing. There is nothing to stop the SIB borrowing the PIA's rule book and delegating most of its regulatory functions to the subordinate body. Only the SIB's disciplinary procedures cannot be passed down. Nor, after such a public challenge, can Mr Large be expected to do other than ensure that the SIB is no regulatory pushover for the Pru. If he does give the task of monitoring Britain's biggest life company to the subordinate body, the SIB will still be legally obliged to operate a double check. Majority support That said, the PIA, whose genesis has been troubled from the outset, cannot operate without overwhelming majority support from the retail financial services industry. If others follow the Pru in preferring to exercise their statutory right to register with the SIB, Mr Large's plans for improved investor protection through a single retail watchdog will be scuppered. The wider question is whether the abrasive manner in which the Pru has put its case will damage its plea for a different, statutorily based approach to regulation. If it does, it would be a pity, for the Pru has been on the side of common sense through much of the debate. It broke ranks with the Association of British Insurers by supporting the Office of Fair Trading's arguments for greater disclosure. And the theoretical case for statutory regulation, which the Pru claims to want, has arguably been strengthened by the carping that has accompanied the attempt to launch the PIA. There has to be a more effective way of resolving conflicts between the different industry interests. Public confidence Yet the regulatory debate cannot be divorced from its context. Public confidence in the life companies and banks has been severely shaken by the personal pensions fiasco. It is in both the public interest and the interest of the insurers that urgent action is taken to restore order to the industry's sales activities. This cannot wait for legislation, not least because ministers are clearly wary of the political pitfalls in taking on responsibility for monitoring those who are busy mis-selling endowment policies and personal pensions. The short-term priorities must therefore be to make the best of the PIA and to ensure that the new disclosure regime which becomes compulsory next year provides information in a form that allows the consumer to make worthwhile choices. If the industry is forced to compete on the basis of price and quality, instead of the means of distribution, much of its act will be forcibly cleaned up as consumers penalise the inefficient producers. In the longer run full statutory support for the system is probably desirable and may well be inescapable. The Prudential could play a more constructive role by articulating precisely what form it should take, instead of doing battle with the SIB. This might also have the merit of helping dispel widespread suspicions about its motivation in calling for a statutory approach. Clearly there can be no return to the ineffectual monitoring exercised by the Department of Trade and Industry of old. Let us hear the Pru's more detailed alternative.</p>

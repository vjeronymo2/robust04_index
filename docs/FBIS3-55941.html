That Is the Verdict of the Russian  Superior Court of Arbitration"]    [Text] On the penultimate day of the year, a court of  arbitration consisting of chairman O. Boykov and judges A.  Kozlova and I. Polubenina published the main part of its ruling  on a case in which the joint-stock company "IZVESTIYA Newspaper  Editorial Office" was a third party. The protagonists were the  Russian Federal Property Fund (old model) and the IZVESTIYA  publishing house, which had been trying for nearly a year to  secure a ruling that all directives of the Russian Federation  Goskomimushchestvo [State Committee for the Management of State  Property] relating to the conversion of the IZVESTIYA editorial  office to a joint-stock company are invalid. Their petition was  rejected.    Readers of ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA, KOMMERSANT, and several other  publications will doubtless remember that last year from time to  time they saw reports on the "tug-of-war arbitration" involving  IZVESTIYA. Admittedly their authors, who still believe to this  day in the primacy of the material world, represented the case  as a primordial struggle on the juridical "carpet" over a piece  of state property. But just before Christmas we received the  full text of the Superior Court of Arbitration ruling, which  states "that the subject of the present dispute is an act in the  sphere of administrative activity, and not a property dispute  over the use of specific premises."    So the court confirmed that it was not a property dispute.  Frankly, prior to the dissolution of the Supreme Soviet it was  not a legal dispute either. And the events developed not so  much "on the carpet" as "under the carpet." The Supreme Soviet  was using others to fight on its behalf for the newspaper  IZVESTIYA, while IZVESTIYA was fighting for its independence.  Remember that first we totally won the case in the  Constitutional Court. Then the same happened thing at the  Supreme Court, which overruled certain points in the Supreme  Soviet decree touching on the IZVESTIYA collective. In November  the Russian Federal Property Fund totally abandoned its suit.  We can only speculate what pressure had previously been put on  the Superior Court of Arbitration -- the last hope of a  vainglorious and notorious politician in his struggle against  IZVESTIYA.    Well, it seems we are all still here. The arbitration ruling  declared that the Russian Federation Goskomimushchestvo, in  issuing directives on the conversion of the IZVESTIYA editorial  office to a joint-stock company, was acting within its powers.  That is the main point. It can be assumed that the Russian  Federation Superior Court of Arbitration has confirmed the  legality of the formation of the "IZVESTIYA Newspaper Editorial  Office" joint-stock company of the open type, and its existence  for the past year and three months.    The discursive section of the court ruling ends with a  reservation: The conversion of the editorial office to a  joint-stock company must not violate the publishing house's  rights to the premises it actually occupies. Who is going to  argue with that? Especially since it goes on to say, in black  and white: "Where there is a dispute over specific premises, the  dispute should be examined under the general complaints  procedure between the editorial office and the publishing house."    On the one hand this is reassuring -- the "general  procedure"  -- but on the other, does this really mean that as the Superior  Court of Arbitration ruling enters into legal force we will only  receive the right to be the protagonist and not a third party in  the next court case?    But time will tell. At the moment the IZVESTIYA editorial  office is sincerely grateful to Russian Federation  Goskomimushchestvo expert N. Osokin and the lawyers of the law  firm "Samsonov and Partners", who upheld the justice of our  common case in the court of arbitration.    One last point: The end of the proceedings in the Superior  Court of Arbitration coincided with the start of the printing of  IZVESTIYA at the "Pressa" publishing house's printing plant.  This timing was no accident. But in order to avoid  misinterpretations, let us explain: The move to the "Pressa"  printing plant was motivated solely by technical factors,  specifically the need (under an international contract) to  continue to print FINANSOVYYE IZVESTIYA on our English partner's  paper and our desire at the same time to produce the television  supplement on blue paper. Otherwise, there would have been no  need for the extra trouble for ourselves and some of our readers  who did not receive the first issues of the newspaper on time.  For which we offer them our apologies.</p>

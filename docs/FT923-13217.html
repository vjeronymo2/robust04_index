			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / FT Law Report: Surveyor may owe duty of care THE NICHOLAS H Queen's Bench Division (Commercial Court): Mr Justice Hirst: July 2 1992 A SHIPS' classification society owes a duty of care capable of giving rise to a liability in damages to cargo-owners if its surveyor's recommendation influences shipowners to sail a defective ship and, as was reasonably foreseeable, she sinks with the cargo on board. Mr Justice Hirst so held on a preliminary issue in an action by Marc Rich &amp; Co AG, owners of cargo carried on Nicholas H, against the Japanese classification society, Nippon Kaiji Kyokai. HIS LORDSHIP said the action arose out of the total loss on March 9 1986 of Nicholas H and her cargo on a voyage from Peru and Chile to Italy and the Soviet Union. The cargo consisted of lead and zinc concentrate owned by Marc Rich. The total pleaded value of the lost cargo was over Dollars 8m. The action was begun against the shipowners and Nippon. The owners sought to limit liability under the Hague Rules, and the claim against them was settled for Dollars 500,000. The action against Nippon was for the Dollars 5.5m balance. The claim against Nippon was in tort. The preliminary issue was whether on the facts pleaded Nippon owed a duty of care to Marc Rich capable of giving rise to liability in damages. For the purposes of the preliminary issue only, the facts were assumed. The vessel loaded at Callao in Peru and Antofagasta in Chile. On February 22 1986 she anchored off San Juan, Puerto Rico, with a crack in her hull. Further cracks developed. Arrangements were made for Nippon to survey the vessel at anchor. The surveyor's report recommended that repairs be carried out at the nearest port prior to sailing to Italy, and that the vessel be retained as classed subject to those conditions. The recommendation would have involved permanent repairs, for which facilities were available locally. Temporary repairs were carried out. The shipowners baulked at carrying out the recommended permanent repairs. The vessel was surveyed again. The surveyor recommended that she proceed to Italy, the repairs to be examined and dealt with as necessary after discharging cargo. On March 2 the vessel sailed. The following day the temporary repairs cracked. On March 9 she sank with all her cargo. There were no casualties. Marc Rich alleged that Nippon was negligent in altering the initial recommendation and permitting the vessel to continue her voyage when only temporary repairs had been carried out. Mr Gross for Marc Rich contended that as a result of recent decisions the law had drawn a clear dividing line between physical damage cases and economic loss cases. He said that in physical damage cases all the plaintiffs needed to do to establish a duty of care was to prove (i) foreseeability that lack of care might result in harm; and (ii) ownership or appropriate possessory interest in the property physically damaged or lost. He submitted there was no need to make good the two additional criteria which applied in economic loss cases, namely (iii) proximity and (iv) that it would be 'fair, just and reasonable' to impose a duty of care in tort. If he was wrong on his main submission he submitted he could make good his case on (iii) and (iv) on the assumed facts. Mr Aikens for Nippon submitted that the general principles stated in economic loss cases were equally applicable to physical damage cases and that (iii) and (iv) applied. His basic submission was that since a shipowner was under a non-delegable duty as bailee to take care of cargo there was no room for the imposition of a further duty on a classification society. He argued that Nippon had the closest and most direct relationship with the shipowners, so that the undoubted claim against them and the suggested claim against Nippon were mutually exclusive. In Grant v Australian Knitting Mills (1936) AC 85 it was argued by the defendant manufacturers of a defective garment which the plaintiffs had bought from an intermediate retailer, that the contractual relationships covered the whole field and excluded any question of tort liability. Lord Wright disposed of the argument. He said the claims in contract, based on independent causes of action and different considerations, were irrelevant to the claim in tort. He said 'the tort liability is independent of any question of contract'. Though on its different facts Grant was not binding, that principle applied in the present case, seeing that the claim against Nippon was a separate cause of action, based on different considerations, and independent of any question of contract. Mr Aikens's basic submission was rejected. House of Lords authorities showed clearly that the law had in recent years tended to draw an ever stronger contrast between economic loss and physical loss cases (see Murphy (1991) 1 AC 398). However, it was not accepted that just because general statements of principle appeared in economic loss cases they must invariably be restricted to that class. So far as proximity was concerned it was clear that in the great majority of physical damage cases (see Hua Lien (1991) 1 Lloyd's Rep 309, 328) the duty of care did not give rise to any problem because it was self-evident that a duty existed (eg, in road and factory accident cases). But having regard to statements in Caparo (1990) 2 AC 605,617,633 and Murphy (page 485), it seemed clear that proximity was a relevant criterion in physical damage cases, particularly where there was no direct physical contact between the plaintiff and defendant or between vehicles or equipment under their control. The proximity criterion was essential in the present case, particularly since there was such a wide variety of circumstances where a party not in contractual relationship with Nippon might seek to establish liability and where proximity provided a valuable test for separating the sheep from the goats. The 'fair, just and reasonable' criterion was a relevant test in economic loss cases. The only physical damage case in which it was applied was Dorset Yacht (1970) AC 1004, where exceptional public policy considerations existed. That criterion would be relevant very exceptionally in physical damage cases, and then only if the defendants could establish that public policy considerations required the court to give immunity from a duty of care which would otherwise have been upheld. On the assumed facts there was a very close degree of proximity between the surveyor and Marc Rich. Although he had no direct physical control over the vessel the decisive influence on the shipowners which his second recommendation must have had, and would reasonably be foreseen to have, was very akin to control. Therefore, on the assumed facts, a sufficiently close and direct relationship of proximity was established. That conclusion was based simply on those assumed facts and had no general application to any other situation which might arise between a classification society and cargo-owners or other third parties with whom it was not in contractual relationship. There were no special public policy considerations which justified application of the 'fair, just and reasonable' criterion. If, however, that was wrong, the court was satisfied there was nothing on public policy grounds to debar Marc Rich from making good the duty of care. On the facts pleaded Nippon did owe Marc Rich a duty of care capable of giving rise to a liability in damages. The word 'capable' was emphasised because nothing in the judgment should be interpreted as establishing that Nippon actually owed such a duty of care. The assumed facts were in issue and could only be determined on a full trial after all the evidence had been heard. For Marc Rich: Mr Peter Gross QC (Lovell White Durrant). For Nippon: Mr Richard Aikens QC and Jonathan Harvie (Norton Rose).</p>

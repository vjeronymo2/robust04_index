"I  think it's a wise decision," Mr De Klerk said on the CCV  [Contemporary Community Values] programme Newsline. "That now,  to my mind, prepares the table for further negotiations between  us as a government and the PAC with regard to practical  matters," he said.    Mr De Klerk expressed the hope that the decision would be  obeyed by cadres of the Azanian People's Liberation Army, the  PAC's military wing. "I really do hope that they succeed in  disciplining the APLA people to obey their policy decision and  to fall in line and to also in practise stop with violent  actions and planning violent deeds and making attacks."</p>

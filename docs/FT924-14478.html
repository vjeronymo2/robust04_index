			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Leigh-Pemberton defends tactics A SPIRITED defence of Britain's tactics in attempting to keep the pound within the ERM was made last night by Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England. Speaking in Cambridgeshire, he said Britain did all it could to defend the pound by concerted Bank intervention in currency markets. Any decision to raise rates earlier than Black Wednesday on September 16 - when sterling was forced to leave the ERM - would have been seen as 'quixotic' given the depth of the recession. He said a decision prior to Black Wednesday for Britain to have devalued sterling within the ERM - perhaps by joining the realignment early last month in which the lira was devalued - would not have made sense as the pound was not overvalued against other European currencies. The governor said an overriding reason for the currency turbulence was high German interest rates forcing up the D-Mark, a sequence of events prompted by the largely unforeseen inflationary pressures of German unification. 'I am not persuaded by the view - expressed more frequently with the benefit of hindsight - that we should have seen the writing on the wall much earlier and drawn the appropriate conclusion at that time,' he said. The governor defended the Bank's intervention to prop up the pound only relatively late in September when sterling was already weak. Intervention on a big scale earlier 'would have hastened rather than postponed the collapse'. He also said raising interest rates earlier in September or the previous month in an effort to hold up the pound would not have had the intended effect. 'Raising UK interest rates, when the economy was so weak and inflationary pressure so subdued . . . would have been regarded not just by the financial markets, but by the world as a whole, as transparently perverse.'</p>

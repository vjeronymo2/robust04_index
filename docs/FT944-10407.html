			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses higher on US election results Bourses were able to reflect the Republican election victory earlier than their US counterparts, and doubled or trebled the level of Wall Street's anticipatory gains overnight, writes Our Markets Staff. When the Dow put on a percentage point in early trading, said Mr James Lister-Cheese of Independent Strategy, it looked as if the US were following Europe, rather than the other way around. However, bourses seemed willing to follow Wall Street down when it lost some of its enthusiasm. Independent Strategy said that the Republican victory, and its potential impact on external trade decisions and the progress of internal budget reductions in the US, was likely to cause volatility in financial markets. 'On a one-year view, we think that 10-year US Treasury yields will rise to 8.5 per cent from today's level of 8.0 per cent.' FRANKFURT came back from a session's gain of 43.03 or 2.1 per cent at 2,096.47 to 2,090.78 at the end of Ibis trading. Retailers stayed weak on worries about consumption trends, said Mr Jens Wiecking at Merck Finck in Dusseldorf, but otherwise the market rose across the board in the morning; turnover nearly doubled, from DM4.2bn to DM8bn. The afternoon saw relative weakness in a number of big blue chips. Siemens and Volkswagen, up DM4 to DM625.40 and DM5 to DM447.50, were both well off the top. Analysts said that a Siemens results conference had been disappointing in content, and VW's global car sales in September dropped by more than 6 per cent. In chemicals, BASF rose only DM1.10 to DM317 after talk of a takeover bid for Boots' pharmaceuticals division, diluting hopes for BASF's gas business; and Viag, the utility based conglomerate, up just DM1 to DM471, extended its role as a Dax underperformer in September and October. ZURICH was cheered by hopes of a stronger dollar, and the SMI index rose 46.5 or 1.8 per cent to 2,590.4 as analysts noted that the weakness of the US currency had depressed the third-quarter results of the big exporters by around 8 per cent. Pharmaceuticals were lifted by expectations that a Republican majority in Congress would slow President Bill Clinton's health reforms. Roche certificates picked up SFr155 to SFr5,945 and Ciba registered were SFr21 ahead at SFr749. Insurers firmed as they sought to play down their exposure to the storm damage in northwest Italy. Zurich Insurance registered were SFr26 higher at SFr1,241. UBS stayed volatile, with the bank said to be buying the bearers and Mr Martin Ebner's BK Vision picking up the registered stock ahead of the extraordinary shareholders' meeting on November 22. The bearers rose SFr21 to SFr1,204 and the registered were SFr14 higher at SFr286. PARIS tailed off during the afternoon session, the CAC-40 index ending with a gain of 22.32 or 1.2 per cent at 1,943.86, after a high of 1,961. Turnover improved to FFr4.5bn. Alcatel lost FFr15.60 at FFr432.00 after its German unit reported that it was to lay off a larger than expected number of employees during 1994 and 1995. Alcatel-SEL, of Germany, also said that it saw no return to profitability before 1996. Lafarge Coppee, the building materials group, outperformed the market with an advance of FFr15 to FFr406 after reporting an 8.5 per cent increase in nine-month sales. AMSTERDAM was driven higher by overall strength on the Continent. The AEX index added 3.85 at 411.54. Royal Dutch, expected to announce a modest rise in third-quarter figures today, with the chemicals side likely to show the best performance, firmed Fl 1.70 to Fl 191.30. MILAN was carried along by the upbeat mood elsewhere, although domestic and budgetary worries were never far from the surface. The Comit index gained 10.74 or 1.7 per cent at 630.89. Blue chips were broadly higher, with Fiat up L141 at L6,245, Montedison L29 at L1,254 and Telecom Italia L136 at L4,212. Among the banks, Credito Italiano picked up L32 to L1,628, after the end of bourse trading of its rights issue on Tuesday, and as its offer for Credito Romagnolo remained in play. Romagnolo rose L183 to L16,669. BCI appreciated L75 to L3,585. Insurers were mixed as the industry continued to assess the storm damage in the northwest of the country. Generali rose L431 to L37,881 but Ina was just L2 higher at L2,110. STOCKHOLM hosted better than expected nine-month figures from Electrolux. The Affarsvarlden index rose 15.2 to 1,461.0, although worries persisted over the outcome of Sunday's EU referendum. Electrolux B added SKr9.50 at SKr365, while the drug sub-index advanced 1.9 per cent ahead of reports from Pharmacia today, and Astra tomorrow. Astra 'A' rose SKr5 to SKr192.50 and Pharmacia 'A' climbed SKr2.50 to SKr135.

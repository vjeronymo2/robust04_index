			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Debts of Pounds 34m before collapse Whatever the legality of Mr Roger Levitt's financial manoeuvres, the Levitt Group was in dire trouble, with debts of Pounds 34m, before its final collapse in December 1990. Salaries and other costs were wildly out of control. Sales figures were boosted in unorthodox ways, giving a falsely optimistic impression of the company's actual business. In addition, the company's internal book-keeping was, by common consent, a complete mess. According to the Serious Fraud Office, the company made a loss of Pounds 13m between January 1989 and June 1990 and was heading for the rocks. The total prosecution case against Mr Levitt, intended to be brought in two trials, alleged widespread fraud by him and others in an attempt to keep the company going. The substance of the raft of criminal charges involved: Improper inducements to attract investors' funds. The routing of investors' money into the Levitt Group's company account to keep it afloat. The misrepresentation by Mr Levitt of Pounds 21m obtained through loans and other sources as the result of genuine business. The falsification of documents to turn the Pounds 13m loss into a Pounds 13m profit, presenting the outside world with a false picture of the company's viability. The deception of Fimbra to maintain membership of the regulatory body. The last charge was the only one to which Mr Levitt pleaded guilty. The others have been left on the file, not to be acted upon. Mr Levitt maintains his innocence with regard to these. The Levitt Group went into liquidation owing money to assorted creditors. The largest of these, technically, was Mr Levitt himself, owed some Pounds 22m as a result of investments in his company made in his own name. These transactions, however, were the subject of some of the charges that will not now be pursued. The next largest creditors were Barclays and Midland banks, which had both extended overdraft facilities of Pounds 4.5m. Other creditors included the Inland Revenue, which was owed Pounds 1.5m. The rest was made up of smaller creditors, including some 50 individuals. A number of these later received compensation totalling Pounds 625,000 through the Investors' Compensation Scheme. The largest individual investor was the writer, Mr Frederick Forsyth, who lost some Pounds 900,000 through his involvement in the company.</p>

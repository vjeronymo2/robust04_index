			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Cash call worries hurt CU COMPOSITE insurer Commercial Union fell 16 to 618p on turnover of 2.8m shares amid renewed speculation that the company might be considering a rights issue. Analysts said a cash call by Commercial Union was possible given its aim for growth in new business, the general pressure on margins and the recent rise in its share price to an all-time high of 644p. In 1992, CU announced Pounds 100m preference share placings. Both Kleinwort Benson and Credit Lyonnais Laing were reinforcing their view that the stock was overvalued. Kleinwort's insurance analyst said the shares were at an 8 per cent premium to net asset value at the start of trading yesterday, and he also cited weekend press comment on the possibility of impending rights issues. Elsewhere in the sector, General Accident lost 16 at 558p and Sun Alliance fell 7 to 351p. Royal Insurance, which is particularly in need of extra cash, was 8 lower at 283p. HSBC supported A strong overnight performance by Hong Kong's Hang Seng index prompted HSBC Holdings to buck the dreary trend in London and the shares received further support from a recommendation by Robert Fleming Securities. Fleming published a buy note arguing that the bank will produce profits of Pounds 1.6bn in 1992 and Pounds 2.2bn in 1993. It also announced a Pounds 131.8m warrant issue. HSBC ordinaries were 10 higher at one stage and closed 3 up at 519p. The Hong Kong registered added 1 1/2 at 497 1/2 p and combined turnover was 11m shares. Institutions have taken additional heart from comments on Friday by Chinese leaders on the Sino-British row over Hong Kong's plans for political reform. Cable and Wireless, which is also heavily influenced by market activity in Hong Kong, gained a penny at 708p. However, Standard Chartered, one of the Footsie's best performers in recent months, shed 9 to 581p on profit-taking. Alexon raided Further evidence of the fragile state of the consumer recovery was shown with a bear raid on Alexon ahead of an expected cautious trading statement this week. Shares in the clothes retailer dived sharply as the market opened, losing around 20 per cent of their value before steadying. They closed at 82p, a fall of 17 on the day. The drop was at first blamed on a downgrade by Morgan Stanley, but the broker later denied this. If the bears are to be believed, Alexon will join a growing list of retailers to report flat pre-Christmas sales - taking the shine from earlier talk that the much-heralded consumer recovery was gathering pace. Analysts said they expected Alexon to reveal no improvement at its Dash chain, where sales had been under pressure, resulting in downgrades last quarter. Nervousness over the strength of the retail revival also undermined the stores sector. Ratners, due to announce the level of its Christmas sales shortly, ran into the bearish sentiment and the shares slipped 1 1/2 to 11 3/4 p on turnover of 18m. So too did Body Shop, off 10 at 164p. The hangover from last week's trading statement from Boots, in which the retailer revealed poor sales at its Do It All subsidiary, continued. Analysts reported that the DIY group's owners - Boots and WH Smith - were hinting that losses this year could reach Pounds 30m, double most market estimates. This comes on top of reports that the two groups will need to invest a further Pounds 15m into Do It All to fund a new distribution centre. Boots fell 10 to 500p and WH Smith 'A' 13 to 456p. A number of brokers advised profit-taking in Dixons, whose shares have surged in post-Christmas trading on reports of strong computer games sales and buoyant US electronics demand. However, neither of these factors satisfied BZW, which said Dixons' US subsidiary Silo is still in difficulties and the effect of sterling devaluation has still to be felt. Nomura was also negative, arguing that the shares had run too far. Yesterday they fell 12 to 262p. Conglomerate Hanson held steady among weak internationally traded stocks on reports that it had swapped its US gold mining operations for the coal business of railroads and minerals group Santa Fe Pacific. If it proceeds, the swap would make Hanson the world's second largest privately held coal producer, while placing Santa Fe among the top 10 US gold producers. The stock also received some support ahead of a presentation to analysts in New York yesterday. Hanson shares eased 1 1/2 to 236p. Profit forecast upgrades for BAT Industries by Hoare Govett failed to counter the impact of a weaker dollar and the shares fell 12 to 968p. Hoare has raised its figure for the year to March 10 by Pounds 60m to Pounds 1.63bn and that for the following year by Pounds 35m to Pounds 2.175bn. The house is basing its reassessment on a better than expected output from the tobacco side and a faster turnround for Eagle Star. Among other dollar stocks, Reuters Holdings receded 14 to 1388p in spite of announcing the launch of a new real time service for global money and capital markets. Shell lost 10 to 533p after a good run as investors switched into Royal Dutch. Glaxo and SmithKline Beecham stood out firmly in a weak market as investors took advantage of last week's price decline among big pharmaceutical companies. A 1 per cent rise in Merck in New York also helped the shares. Salomon Brothers was heavily on the bid again. Glaxo rose 8 to 740p and SmithKline a penny to 469p in the 'A's and 3 to 412p in the Units. Wellcome was 9 lower at 925p, however, following weekend press reports of patent issues surrounding its two leading drugs. AAH retreated 18 to 597p after a recent run. Broker Hoare Govett, although still a buyer of the shares, shaved its forecasts. The decision by Associated British Foods not to proceed with the purchase of a US sugar processing group disappointed some in the market and the shares fell 8 to 505p. Strong second line stocks from last week met profit-taking. Among these, Booker fell 12 to 415p, Unigate 10 to 320p and Hillsdown, which is hosting a series of institutional meetings this week, 10 to 134p. Iceland Frozen Foods slipped 13 1/2 to 651p. Kleinwort Benson was said to have moved from a buy to a hold position. Rights issue talk again stalked Stakis and the hotel and casino group lost 3 to 41p. Profit-taking hit the engineering sector, which has outperformed the market by around 15 per cent over the past month. Siebe gave up 21 at 430p, further affected by vague talk of a rights issue, while IMI dipped 12 to 266p. Vickers 8 to 114p, Simon Engineering 9 to 110p and Meggitt 5 to 92p. Reports of a US investigation into a subsidiary hurt TI Group and the shares weakened 10 to 298p. However, Mr Paul Compton at Credit Lyonnais Laing said: 'Given that the contract under investigation is only worth Pounds 1m, I think the fall has been overdone.' Smiths Industries eased 4 to 376p, with BZW shifting its recommendation from buy to hold. However, the house stressed it was a long-term supporter of the stock. Although Tomkins reported a 7.6 per cent improvement in interim figures to Pounds 47.1m, the meeting with analysts disappointed and the shares fell 11 to 246p in trade of 3.6m. Trafalgar House softened 2 to 87p after the chairman told the annual meeting he foresaw no upturn in 1993. Profit-taking and switching sent BICC down 8 to 334p. Dealers reported switching into Delta, steady at 435p. A downgrading in Rugby took the shine off the building materials sector. The shares retreated 15 to 219p and pulled down Blue Circle 9 to 196p in their wake. USM-quoted aromatic oils company Treatt advanced 10 to 118p on healthy annual profits. Chemicals group Laporte rallied 4 to 587p following its bid for Evode, a penny firmer at 120p, as a buy note from Williams de Broe landed on clients' desks.

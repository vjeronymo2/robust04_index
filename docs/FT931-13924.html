			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Tecs protest at 'low gear' project INVESTORS IN PEOPLE, the government's main scheme for improving the training of people in work, is 'still in low gear', Training and Enterprise Councils told a Commons select committee yesterday. Representatives of Tecs, which administer publicly funded training programmes in England and Wales, along with a range of other initiatives including IIP, were giving evidence to the Commons employment committee. Written evidence drawn from the 82 Tecs said that IIP was a key tool in aiding business performance. But it said: 'There is some concern over the national profile and backing, and the resource dedicated to the initiative is small. It is still in low gear.' Tecs said in written evidence that for most companies the national education and training targets - set by the Confederation of British Industry and endorsed by government - were a 'remote and unrecognised part of some national agenda'.</p>

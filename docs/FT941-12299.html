			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Company News (This Week): Moment of truth for Euro Disney prospects - Other companies The Euro Disney banks will meet in Paris on Wednesday to assess the conclusions of the special investigative audit of the troubled leisure group's finances that they commissioned from KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm. The audit analyses the current financial condition of Euro Disney and its future prospects so that the banks can decide how to proceed in their negotiations to put together an emergency rescue package for the company. The meeting was originally scheduled for January 26 but was reportedly delayed because Walt Disney, the US entertainment group that owns 49 per cent of Euro Disney, withheld information from the KPMG auditing team. The banks now hope to finalise their negotiating strategy so that the rescue talks can be concluded by the March 31 deadline imposed by Disney. The marathon takeover battle for entertainment group Paramount Communications may finally reach a climax today, the deadline set by the company's board for best and final offers from rival bidders QVC Network and Viacom. The two have until 5 pm New York time to improve their cash-and-share tender offers, which will then be weighed up by the Paramount board. Investors will have until mid-month to make up their minds. Flat earnings growth is being forecast for Fyffes, the UK and Irish fresh fruit distributor, whose results for the year to October 31 are due on Wednesday. Stockbrokers in Dublin anticipate pre-tax profits of between IPounds 29.5m (Pounds 28.1m) and IPounds 30.5m, up from IPounds 28.5m in 1992. This would be the equivalent to earnings per share of 5.9p (against 5.9p last time). Rhone Poulenc Rorer, the pharmaceuticals division of Rhone Poulenc, the French chemicals group which was privatised at the end of last year, will today announce its results for last year and its strategy for 1994. RPR achieved a 31 per cent rise in net profits to Dollars 428m (Pounds 285.3m) in 1992. But last year the group was confronted with a more difficult environment as many governments implemented healthcare reforms and measures to limit expenditure on drugs. Fiat, Italy's biggest private company, will today reveal preliminary figures pointing to one of the biggest losses in its 95-year history. Though Fiat's full earnings figures and dividend will not be announced until May, the group is expected to provide figures indicating a pre-tax loss of more than L2,000bn (Pounds 784.31m) on sales of almost L54,000bn in 1993, excluding disposals.</p>

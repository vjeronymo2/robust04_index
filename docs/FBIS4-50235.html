			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [XINHUA "Roundup" by Li Zhigao: "Hong Kong Viewers Complain </F> About Poor TV Programs"]    [Text] Hong Kong, May 14 (XINHUA) -- Hong Kong people have  more and more TV sets but a growing number of viewers are  complaining about the poor quality of TV programs and the grave  competition among local TV stations.    A survey by the broadcasting authority reveals that more  individuals consider the portrayals of violence, sex, nudity,  triad rituals, triad jargon, and homosexuality on commercial  television unacceptable.    Compared with 1990, four times as many viewers reportedly  thought the quality of drama series was low, three times as many  thought the same about children's programs and eight times as  many thought cultural and arts programs were poor.    Recently, the number of viewers' complaints are on the rise  as two local TV stations -- the Television Broadcasts Limited  (TVB) and the Asia Television Limited (ATV) -- clashed with each  other by screening the same episode of the drama series "Judge  Bao" at the same time.    One hundred such complaints have now been received, compared  to an average yearly total of 800 for all programs, said David  Webb, secretary of the broadcasting authority.    The survey also found that more than 90 percent of those who  responded consider it necessary to retain the option of the  imposition of financial penalties by the broadcasting authority  for breaches of ordinances related.    The broadcasting authority has decided to call together the  two TV competitors to find a solution to the problem and  legislators have warned to look at what conditions, if any,  could be added to the companies' licenses, which come up for  their mid-term review next month.    While many TV programs were complained about, the news  programs of local TV stations became the only exception to be  praised for high quality by most of the 2,000 respondents in the  survey.    Nearly all individuals aged between 12 and 64 have  television  sets in their households in Hong Kong and 30 percent of them own  two or more television sets.    In addition to the TVB and ATV, each of which has both  Cantonese and English channels, satellite and subscription  televisions were also introduced to the territory in 1991 and  1993, respectively, by the Star TV and the Wharf Cable Limited.    Statistics show that local residents here tend to spend less  time on average watching commercial, wireless television, from  4.2 hours per day in 1990 to 3.5 hours per day this year.</p>

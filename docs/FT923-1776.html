			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Maastricht - The French Vote: Yes for Delors from Merthyr mayor THE MAYOR of Merthyr Tydfil was up early yesterday morning to throw his weight behind Mr Jacques Delors and the Yes campaign. Councillor David Jarrett did not necessarily expect to find himself a central figure in the 11th-hour campaigning. He and a delegation from the Welsh borough's Labour-run council were in Clichy, Merthyr's twin-town, to celebrate the Paris suburb's 70th anniversary. But at about 9.30am they were wheeled out to greet the Commission president  -a former mayor of Clichy - as he arrived in the municipality in order to cast his vote. A somewhat bemused Mr Jarrett, sporting a Oui lapel-badge, admitted that he had never met Mr Delors but added: 'He's a socialist, so I suppose we have that in common.' All in all, it turned out to be a good morning for socialist mayors. Mr Gilles Catoire, the current incumbent in Clichy, could hardly contain his excitement. Such was Mr Catoire's eagerness to please that he spoilt the picture every television crew wanted - a stoical Commission president emerging from the polling booth - by jumping in front of Mr Delors as he swept back the green curtain. Mr Delors himself appeared in buoyant mood, despite the delicate state of Community politics. Voter number 269 joked with cameramen, gave two relaxed interviews in English to British television crews and dutifully posed in front of Oui posters outside the mairie, or town hall. But behind the bravado and bonhomie, there was no mistaking Mr Delors' distress at the apparent collapse of monetary and political consensus in the Community. 'It will be very difficult after the events of this week to find a quick solution so that we can continue the construction of Europe,' the Commission president said. Irrespective of the French vote, the Maastricht Treaty would probably have to be renegotiated to accommodate the Danes, he added. It was a flexible document, not a rigid text - the real difficulty would be guessing which parts of the treaty opponents had rejected. As for Mr Delors' personal stake in the outcome of the referendum, the Commission president confirmed again that a No would prompt his resignation. If necessary, he would 'continue the struggle' from outside the Brussels bureaucracy, he said, through trade unions and professional organisations. If he remained, then one of the Commission's first jobs would be to 'reconcile the Germans and British', whose increasingly angry exchanges over last week's currency crisis risk tainting future Community co-operation. Meanwhile, in the Bar de la Mairie, across the square from Clichy's town hall, the personal fate of the Commission president seemed of little import to locals taking a break from the Sunday market. 'Yes or No, whether they devalue the franc or not, nothing much will change,' muttered one broken-nosed businessman. As the presidential entourage departed - taking Mr Delors to his Paris pied-a-terre for a nervous few hours awaiting the results - the bar's customers scarcely looked up from their breakfast glasses of kir and muscat: just another ex-mayor en route to his destiny.</p>

			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Book Review: Bell ringers for a bright future THE BELL CURVE: Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life By Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray The Free Press, 845 pages, Pounds 25/Dollars 30 The Bell Curve deserves attention not because it revives dubious claims about large ethnic differences in intelligence, but because it makes a plausible case that individual brain power or 'cognitive ability' is a far more important determinant of economic and social success than hitherto recognised. This is a 'big idea' that, if correct, is likely to exert considerable influence on public policy in coming decades. Sceptics should note that Charles Murray, an early critic of welfare spending, has unusually sensitive intellectual antennae. Murray and his co-author, the late Richard Herrnstein, a Harvard psychologist, argue that variations in IQ help explain many puzzling social phenomena. They believe incomes are growing more unequal, even for people with similar qualifications, in part because economic competition is forcing employers to reward personal productivity, which depends largely on IQ. Low intelligence, meanwhile, appears to be closely correlated with nearly all social problems, including poverty, illegitimate births, school drop-outs, welfare dependency, divorce and crime. To give one example, the proportion of American whites below the poverty line is 30 per cent for the 'very dull' (IQs below 75) against 2 per cent for the 'very bright' (IQs above 125). The point the authors drive home repeatedly is that IQ has become a much more important determinant of an individual's life chances than the socio-economic class of the parents - the factor that most researchers tend to emphasise. Thus a bright child from a poor background has a much better chance of graduating from college than a dull child from a privileged background. Intelligence was once fairly evenly distributed throughout society; most high IQ individuals were neither well-educated nor rich because arbitrary economic and social barriers prevented their advancement. Ironically, say Murray and Herrnstein, progress toward the liberal goal of genuine equality of opportunity is causing a pernicious new form of social stratification - an aristocracy of the intellect. To a far greater extent than before, the very bright are monopolising elite universities and hogging the best jobs in 'high IQ' fields, such as investment banking, law, medicine and the higher reaches of public policy, academia and the media. These meritocrats tend to be segregated from the rest of society - financially, culturally and even physically (via private security guards). You may object that this puts a ridiculous emphasis on IQ: surely many other qualities such as perseverance, integrity and sociability also influence personal performance. The authors dub this the 'compensating skills fallacy': these other qualities are important but people with high IQs are no less likely to possess them than the less able, they say. Superior cognitive ability thus becomes the determining advantage; hence its power as a predictor of performance. The book invites criticism on many grounds. The argument about social stratification by IQ, for example, is supported mainly by anecdotal evidence: the authors do not establish a strong statistical correlation between IQ and earnings. And since the authors believe such stratification could undermine civil society, it is curious that they urge a shift of educational resources towards gifted children; their analysis surely suggests that it is the less able who need more help. The notion that low IQ is the most important cause of social problems also sits oddly with the experience of the past 30 years: crime, welfare dependency and illegitimacy have mushroomed, yet measured IQ has risen over this period, especially at the bottom end. More controversial is their incendiary claim that the gap between the average IQ of US whites and blacks is not only large but unlikely to contract much in the foreseeable future. They need this finding to justify their impassioned critique of 'affirmative action' policies to help minorities. If you allow for ethnic differences in IQ, they claim, many of the alleged signs of discrimination against blacks disappear or are reversed. Holding IQ constant, blacks earn nearly as much as whites and are more likely to graduate from college and enter elite professions. Blacks only seem to be discriminated against because, as a group, they have low IQs. Yet Murray and Herrnstein admit that environmental factors account for 40-60 per cent of differences in IQ. Blacks are certainly less socio-economically privileged than whites, so a substantial (but maybe temporary) measured IQ differential is to be expected. Moreover IQ is itself a rather fuzzy concept: the authors note that average IQs may have risen as much as 15 points in just two generations (a phenomenon known as the 'Flynn' effect). The only credible explanation is an improved environment: for example better education and nutrition, especially for the poor. Again the implication is that black and white IQs will tend to converge as environmental differences are reduced - a trend perhaps already evident in school test results. In the long run, colour-blind social policies are desirable: individuals should be judged as individuals, not as members of ethnic groups. But if IQ differentials mainly reflect disparities in environment rather than innate differences, short-term biases in favour of certain groups are not so illogical. The authors deserve great credit for attempting to smash what has become a ridiculous taboo on open discussion of IQ differences - and for making a complex argument lucid. They may be exaggerating the significance of IQ, but we will not know for sure until other researchers follow their lead into forbidden territory. My guess is that The Bell Curve will trigger an avalanche of research into the social and economic consequences of IQ variations.</p>

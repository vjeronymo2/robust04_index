			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 12 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  denied Thursday [12 May] that Japan had secretly agreed with the  United States in 1969 to allow Washington to deploy nuclear arms  on Okinawa island to defend Japan and America's other Asian  allies in times of emergency.    "Although former Prime Minister (Eisaku) Sato and U.S.  President (Richard) Nixon were recently alleged to have signed  the secret agreement, such a pact does not in fact exist," Hata  told the House of Representatives plenary session.    "My government will firmly continue to live up to Japan's  three antinuclear principles," Hata said in response to Tomiichi  Murayama, leader of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [of Japan,  SDPJ], the nation's No. 2 opposition party.    The three principles bar Japan from manufacturing and  authorizing foreign nations to bring to or store nuclear weapons  on Japanese soil.    Hata was referring to a recent allegation in a book authored  by Kei Wakaizumi, a former special emissary of Sato, in  negotiations with the Nixon administration, that led up to a  1969 accord to return then U.S.-held Okinawa to Japanese  sovereignty without the presence of nuclear weapons there.    Wakaizumi, a former Defense Agency researcher, alleged Sato  and Nixon signed the top-secret memorandum at the White House on  November 21, 1969. The memorandum says Japan is aware of U.S.  expectations for a favorable response to possible U.S. requests  to deploy nuclear weapons on Okinawa in times of a contingency.    Wakaizumi, who negotiated with then National Security  Adviser  Henry Kissinger on behalf of Sato who sought Okinawa's return  without nuclear arms, quoted Sato as saying, "Because Mr. Nixon  signed (the memorandum) with his full name, I also signed it  with my full name."    The former lecturer at the Johns Hopkins University said  Sato  demanded that the signing be shrouded in secrecy for fear of  angering Japanese media people, many of whom were then balking  at the Japan-U.S. security treaty.    Murayama told the Diet, "Then the special envoy of Prime  Minister Sato exposed the secret agreement that authorizes the  United States to deploy nuclear weapons in times of a  contingency, which was inked after the announcement of the  Japan-U.S. communique in November 1969."    Hata issued his denial after the SDP leader rapped the  government for allowing the presence of U.S. military bases in  Okinawa by referring to the recent crash of two F-15 U.S. jet  fighters, which Murayama said pained Okinawan residents.    Hata also spurned Murayama's demand to immediately resume  negotiations with North Korea to establish diplomatic ties with  Pyongyang.    "Japan will never normalize its relations with North Korea  unless the country clears up international suspicions over its  suspected nuclear weapons program," the premier said.    He urged Pyongyang to comply with the U.N. Security Council  presidential statement, which called for North Korea to allow  the International Atomic Energy Agency to conduct unimpeded  inspection of its nuclear facilities.    On a related topic, Hata also said Japan's Constitution  prohibits the country's involvement in collective security,  brushing aside concerns that his government may move toward  active military actions overseas.    "I think collective security is beyond the boundary of the  Constitution, and it is in practice not permitted," he said.    "I have no intention to change" the conventional  interpretation of the Constitution by the postwar Japanese  Government on the issue, he said.    He was responding to a query by Yohei Kono, president of the  Liberal Democratic Party, the No. 1 opposition party.    Although Japan has the right for collective security in  terms  of international law, Hata argued the war-denouncing  Constitution only grants Japan the "minimum necessary" rights  for self-defense.    Hata also displayed a cautious stance toward the proposed  legislation to deal with a contingency on the Korean peninsula.    The issue requires a "highly political judgment" and "should  be considered cautiously," he said.    The remark is an apparent effort to distance himself from  some key cabinet members, including Foreign Minister Koji  Kakizawa, who recently called for early steps toward legislation  for dealing with international emergencies, such as the crisis  over North Korea's suspected nuclear arms program.    However, in a reply to Murayama's similar question, Hata  said, "The government is now considering such legislation to  eliminate any ambiguities (concerning a response to a  contingency) as it should appeal to the public to endorse it  when necessary."</p>

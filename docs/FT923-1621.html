			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Maastricht - After the French Vote: Fleeting relief but European concern lingers EUROPEAN business leaders, reacting on the whole with relief to the French referendum result, yesterday assessed the impact of the narrow Yes vote on their national economies and currencies. In Spain the initial positive reaction from business was replaced by concern over how the government would respond to the continued threat to the value of the peseta. Mr Jose Maria Cuevas, leader of the CEOE employers' federation, said that while 'the referendum result clears away some of the uncertainties after such great drama', the government had to begin implementing measures which would complement the 5 per cent devaluation in the peseta, agreed in Brussels last week. This, he said, would not only involve the tight budget promised for 1993 but also tackling structural rigidities in the labour market: 'We have to be humble and admit that our economy is not sufficiently competitive.' Mr Enrique Portocarrero, president of the Circulo de Empresarios Vascos, an influential Basque employers' group, said despite the French vote: 'We are still worried. The vote does not clear the horizon for us, especially as the finance minister appears not to have ruled out a further devaluation.' That would assist exporters but the inflationary consequences would delay any interest rate cuts. The question in France itself was how the franc would fare and whether Mr Michel Sapin, France's finance minister, would be able to fulfil his aim of reducing interest rates. Mr Robert Lion, chairman of Caisse des Depots, one of France's largest financial institutions, said the referendum 'paved the way for the French economy to return to growth'. However, he warned that the government should not be tempted to relax its tight control over the economy. In Italy, business leaders said the result might help reduce the currency market turmoil affecting the lira, which along with sterling was withdrawn last week from the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM). However, they also stressed that the outcome would maintain the pressure on Italy to pursue monetary and fiscal discipline. Mr Cesare Geronzi, managing director of Banca di Roma, Italy's biggest banking group, said the French decision had led to 'the disappearance of a first cloud over the political and economic future of our countries. Now we need to straighten out the economic and financial situation and re-focus our concentration on Italy's own financial recovery'. Mr Arturo Ferruzzi, the chairman of Ferruzzi Finanaziaria, the holding company controlling Italy's second biggest private sector group, said: 'France has again given Europe a chance. But this opportunity needs to be managed with great prudence, because it will probably be the last. Mr Hilmar Kopper, Deutsche Bank's chief executive, said the opportunity remained for Europe 'to coalesce into a large and strong single currency region'. However, 'it would be irresponsible to try to squeeze all EC nations into the programme at the same time.' British business leaders' focused on the greater freedom of economic policy action provided by the suspension of sterling's ERM membership. Lord Sterling, chairman of P&amp;O, said that the immediate priority for the UK economy, had to be a reduction in UK interest rates. 'There is no point looking over our shoulders and blaming the Germans. We need to put our own house in order.' Mr Roger Wood, financial director of construction company Wimpey, said: 'The effect on our sector is at best marginal. What is needed most is early clarification by the British government of its political and fiscal strategy and how it intends to restore confidence.'</p>

			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Gateway out of poverty trap MR ANTHONY Carbon was successfully running his London-based business as a disc jockey. Then he broke with his business partner and had to leave home for family reasons. At 20 he was homeless and jobless: 'I felt trapped,' he said. For nearly a year he slept where he could. When friends ran out of hospitality he was reduced to living on the streets before finding accommodation at a hostel. Mr Carbon was an example of the link between urban homelessness and unemployment: 'I was looking to restart my career, but with a hostel address companies weren't interested.' It was then he spotted a leaflet advertising Gate, a scheme which aims to break the 'no-home no-job' syndrome. The project guarantees jobs and help with finding accommodation to homeless people who complete a training course designed by British Rail and the London Enterprise Agency. There are now 65 Gate graduates working at BR's Network SouthEast and the course, which has been going for more than a year, boasts a 95 per cent success rate. Mr Carbon is on the BR payroll as a trainee train driver and hopes to leave the hostel soon. The scheme is based in London where several boroughs come high on the government 'deprivation index'. This is used in the designation of urban programme areas eligible for special grants. Unemployment in these areas accounts for 40 per cent of all unemployment in England and Wales. The areas host a concentration of measures to alleviate unemployment such as Employment Training (ET) and Employment Action, which offers the unemployed work experience on community projects. The Gate project is a model of what the government hoped would result from co-operation between public-sector training expertise and private-sector employers. The idea is the brainchild of Mr Peter Thackwray, the agency's head of marketing. This year the project won Pounds 70,000 from government and the European Social Fund and the same amount in sponsorship from the private sector. The scheme has not been trouble free. The original idea to take people directly off the streets was dropped and Gate relies on referrals from hostels. The recession has meant that the only employer able to offer jobs was BR. BR emphasises it does not sacrifice selection standards for philanthropy. Applicants must pass two interviews, and a medical which includes drugs screening. Then trainees face a course in basic literacy and numeracy skills with the final hurdle of a battery of BR aptitude tests. One of the first Gate graduates was Ms Jackie Sharpe who has passed BR clerical exams. She is working for BR after successfully completing one of the four-week courses. Ms Sharpe is working as a track cleaner while waiting for a permanent clerical position.</p>

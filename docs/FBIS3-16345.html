"We are ready to hold talks at an international level the  way  talks between Georgia and Abkhazia are held," he told Interfax  on Tuesday.    As to the idea of uniting South and North Ossetia, supported  by the population of South Ossetia during the referendum in  1992, this question will be discussed in Moscow not in  Tskhinval, he said.    North Ossetia is part of Russia.</p>

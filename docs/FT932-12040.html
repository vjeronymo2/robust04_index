			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Positive thinking pervades G7 gathering THE Group of Seven leading industrial countries yesterday met to intensify their international economic co-operation against a background of increased optimism that the process is producing results. As they gathered in Washington, the finance ministers and central bank governors from the US, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada could look back on several months of significant policy change in their countries as well agreement on new aid for Russia. The objective of yesterday's meeting was to review progress achieved and consider medium-term policy targets such as the reduction of large fiscal deficits in the industrial countries with the objective of fostering prolonged and stable non-inflationary growth. In contrast to some previous G7 meetings, the talks began in harmony. In part, this reflected the determination of Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US treasury secretary, to avoid putting the main trade partners of the US under visible pressure. The atmosphere was improved by Germany's decision this week to lower its market interest rates, a step that may ease the way to lower interest rates across Europe. The intervention by the US Federal Reserve to curb the rapid rise of the yen on foreign exchange markets also drew the teeth from potential controversy by reducing Japanese worries about the threat to export competitiveness. Mr Bentsen indicated that he did not expect much time to be spent on exchange rate issues in the talks. It was expected that recession in Europe's would prompt the US and other G7 countries to seek assurances from Germany that it would lower interest rates further when appropriate. 'We are particularly looking at Europe where growth is dismal,' Mr Bentsen said before the meeting. 'We hope that overall the rates in Europe can be reduced some more.' However, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, made clear yesterday that Germany still faced difficulties in getting inflation down so there could be no question of aggressive rate cutting by the bank. On the other hand, ministers referred to recent Bundesbank rate reductions, the US programme to shrink its budget deficit and Japan's package of fiscal measures to boost its economy as evidence of how the G7 countries are now able to take each others' interests into account when formulating policies. 'In a way it looks like a revitalisation of the G7,' Mr Bentsen said. He said the US was now 'in a position to restore some leadership' as a result of its efforts to tackle its persistent budget deficit - a problem which has made it the butt of criticism from other G7 countries in the past. All participants appeared determined to develop the G7 as a forum for policy co-ordination. Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, said he would propose that the countries come together more frequently when necessary, perhaps for shorter meetings and that they should expend less energy than in the past on drafting communiques. This pattern is already being established. A G7 meeting in February ended without a formal statement, while yesterday's meeting was scheduled to run for half a day only.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso said  today that the salary increase approved by deputies for  themselves is unforgivable. The increase was one of the issues  discussed by Cardoso with the representative of Brazil's  creditor banks in New York today.    [Begin recording] [Reporter Paulo Henrique Amorim] After the  meeting, Bill Rhodes, the banks' representative, said that  tomorrow afternoon he will send a document to all creditor banks  recommending the approval of the Brazilian proposal to replace  the IMF loan with U.S. Government certificates purchased by the  Brazilian Government. Bill Rhodes believes the fact that Brazil  has not obtained a loan yet from the IMF will not prevent the  agreement with Brazil from being signed as scheduled on 15  April. Minister Cardoso said Brazil has enough exchange reserves  to sign an agreement with the banks without problems. I asked  Bill Rhodes if he believes Brazil will be able to maintain a  balanced budget even after the Chamber of Deputies approved a  salary increase for deputies. Rhodes said he does not discuss  Brazilian domestic issues but believes Minister Cardoso will  make the economic plan be fulfilled. I asked the same question  to Minister Cardoso.    [Cardoso] I believe the Senate will have the political  knowledge to understand the current situation and correct what I  find unforgivable: the increase approved at a time when Brazil  needs austerity, when we are asking not to increase workers'  salaries in general. There is no justification for the deputies  to approve a salary increase for themselves, and there would not  be any justification for the Senate to do the same either. [end  recording]</p>

			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / CBI urges cut in government's 1995-96 public expenditure The Confederation of British Industry yesterday urged the government to cut Pounds 5bn from its 1995-96 public expenditure control total of Pounds 263bn as part of a programme to support the recovery, Peter Norman writes. The CBI said the government should: Stick to the goal of holding central government running costs constant in real terms. Make spending departments more accountable for their budgets, so that cost overruns in one area would be funded by savings elsewhere. Bear down on the public-sector wage bill while allowing pay rates to reflect improved productivity. Such steps would allow the government to cut the contingency reserves which are part of its spending totals. The CBI suggested a cut of Pounds 5bn in next year's reserve to Pounds 2bn.</p>

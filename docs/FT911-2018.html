			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Growth at Fenner ends as profits halve FENNER, the diversified Hull-based manufacturing and distribution group, yesterday announced an abrupt end to a period of sustained growth with first-half pre-tax profits nearly halved from Pounds 7.26m to Pounds 3.71m. The fall prompted a 4p decline to 132p in the share price, and underlines the severity and suddenness of the recession which hit UK heavy manufacturing last autumn. Profits in the last full year to end-September rose 21 per cent to Pounds 16.1m, but analysts now expect the total for the current year to be about Pounds 8.5m-Pounds 9m. Turnover for the first half ended March 2 slipped from Pounds 102.5m to Pounds 100.5m. Despite the profit fall the interim is held at 3.45p. Mr Peter Barker, chairman, said this reflected 'the underlying strengths of our various businesses and our confidence in measures taken.' Fenner has cut about 15 per cent of its UK workforce, or 350 jobs, in the current year. Fenner said UK results were affected by destocking and sharp reduction in demand, particularly in power transmission engineering manufacture. Other sectors, such as fluid power and conveyer belts, fared better. Overseas operations increased profits modestly, despite a worldwide recession, a strong pound and high interest rates. The group's recently acquired controlling stake in Hong Kong-based Contimach is expected to help the company address strong Far Eastern competition in power equipment through low-cost sourcing. Mr Barker said 'signs are apparent that demand levels are now stabilising,' but the economic recovery widely forecast for the latter part of 1991 was unlikely to come in time to influence the group's performance in the current year. Mr Barker said Fenner was 'running the rule' over six potential acquisitions in the UK and overseas, one of which in particular looked very attractive. He said the job cuts would produce extraordinary provisions of about Pounds 6m in the current year, although the cash impact would be about Pounds 1m.</p>

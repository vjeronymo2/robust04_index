			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Violence erupts in Manhattan Hispanic neighbourhood VIOLENCE erupted in a mainly Hispanic neighbourhood in northern Manhattan on Monday night, above, as hundreds of demonstrators burned cars and buildings and looted shops in a rampage that left one man dead and 15 injured, writes Alan Friedman in New York. The rioting, in the Washington Heights section of New York, is an embarrassment to Mayor David Dinkins less than a week before the city hosts the Democratic party's national convention. Mr Dinkins has been trying to smarten up New York's image. The six hours of violence began when residents marched through the streets to protest at the shooting by a policeman last Friday of Mr Jose Garcia, a member of the local Dominican community. Police said Mr Garcia was shot dead in a struggle to disarm him, but the protesters claimed he was unarmed. The demonstrators - mainly Dominican teenagers - split into smaller groups and began hurling rocks and bottles at anti-riot police. Mayor Dinkins visited the neighbourhood as the violence began, pledging a full investigation of the circumstances of Mr Garcia's death.</p>

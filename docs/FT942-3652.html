			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / European Elections: Labour's triumph may still not lead to government The Euro-election was not quite as bad for the Conservatives, or indeed for the Liberal Democrats, as it seemed at first sight. Labour's triumph was not on a scale that guarantees its return to government. The Conservatives' 28 per cent of the vote is 6 per cent less than their lowest ever in a national contest, which matches Labour's rock bottom of 28 per cent in the 1983 general election. The party has only one seat north of a line from Ipswich to Worcester and was lucky not to suffer a wipe-out. Only two of its 18 MEPs has a majority over 5 per cent. A 2 per cent further swing would have reduced the party to 5 seats. Yet the Conservatives did hang on at least in England where they came second in all but one of the seats they did not win. They were second in Wales in only two seats and only one in Scotland. Their vote was plainly reduced by the various anti-Europe candidates, who drew in 3 per cent of the vote where they stood. Four anti-Europeans and two Greens just topped 5 per cent and so saved their deposits. But the Conservatives could take comfort in some aspects of the other parties' performance. Labour at 45 per cent was well below its recent 50 per cent poll ratings. The party got 6 per cent less of the vote than the Conservatives did in the first Euro-elections in 1979. The Conservatives have a mountain to climb before the next election but it is more easily surmountable than seemed likely in the aftermath of Eastleigh. There is also solace for the Conservatives in the unexpected pattern of tactical voting. There are eight Tory MEPs in Devon, Dorset, Wiltshire, Hampshire and Sussex who would not be there if Labour voters had behaved as they did in the Newbury and Christchurch by-elections last year. The 100-plus Conservative MPs whose main challenger is from a Liberal Democrat will breathe a bit more easily. The Liberal Democrats won two seats easily and were within 4 per cent of victory in six more. But their vote fell slightly from its 1992 levels everywhere except in its heartland. Sheffield, oddly, provided the one seat where they moved up from third to second place. However they did hold on to and, indeed, improve their position throughout their main territory. This is a solid band from Lands End along the south coast and inland where the Liberals come first or second. This area contains 74 Westminster seats (more than the whole of Scotland). It guarantees the Liberal Democrats a continuing key role in the political game. It is worth looking in more detail at tactical voting. In the two seats the Liberal Democrats gained the Labour vote stayed almost still. In the seats which they nearly won the Labour vote went up (Wight &amp; Hampshire South up 8 per cent, Wiltshire North and Bath up 5 per cent, Devon &amp; Plymouth East up 3 per cent, Dorset &amp; Hampshire West up 3 per cent, Sussex East &amp; Kent South up 5 per cent). Labour voters have not got the message about how to defeat the Conservatives. Of course, they could be right: in Essex North, they jumped from third to first place. But elsewhere there is no doubt that the sympathetic publicity that Labour has received since John Smith's death seriously damaged Liberal Democrat hopes. Labour's 62 MEPs, two more than the Conservatives had in their 1979 Euro-triumph, will have a powerful impact, not only on the balance of forces in the Strasbourg Parliament but also on the party domestically. They will bring administrative resources in the regions and will make themselves heard in the Parliamentary Labour Party. The seven new Labour MEPs from Kent, Essex, Hertfordshire and east Anglia will also fill a gap in the party's representation in an area where they now have only 3 MPs. Conservative MEPs had some difficulty in making themselves heard at Westminster. But the defeats in Cumbria, Central Lancashire and Lincolnshire will further dull any northern voice in Britain's predominantly southern government. The Liberal Democrats came second nowhere except Sheffield. They do look like a regional party. But then so do the Conservatives. The nationalist challenge is impressive. Plaid Cymru made no gains but it emerged as a serious challenger in two of the five Welsh seats. Dafydd Wigley's vote increase from 13 to 33 per cent since 1992 was remarkable. Still more remarkable was the SNP's crushing victory in North East Scotland with an increase from 26 to 42 per cent. Winnie Ewing enjoyed a 40 per cent margin in the Highland and Islands. The SNP only sank to the third in Scotland South where they missed second place by 500 votes. Their 32 per cent share of the vote was the highest they have yet achieved in a Scotland-wide test. The Conservatives on 14 per cent of the Scottish vote have plumbed new depths in an area where, back in 1979, they won five of the eight Euro-seats. The regional map is certainly far from uniform, with large areas of wasteland for each of the parties. But the national swing is surprisingly uniform. The percentage increase in Labour's vote was up 12 per cent in the Midlands and 13.9 per cent in London. The nature of Labour's victory is evident in one statistic which has its implications for the next Euro-election: 52 out of Labour's 62 victors got over 40 per cent of the vote. Only three of the 18 Conservative MEPs topped 40 per cent. The other 15 struggled home in three-way splits. Politicians with marginal seats try to make their mark and struggle to keep their leaders on a popular path. We may be hearing more from our MEPs.

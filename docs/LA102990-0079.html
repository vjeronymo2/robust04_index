Over  the past two years, usually rare sea turtles, sea otters, huge Risso's  dolphins, blue whale, sperm whale, minke whale, king salmon and giant squid  have been sighted. On the other hand, normally plentiful sharks and white  croakers are scarce. . . . What's going on? "I don't completely understand it,"  says marine biologist Dennis Kelly of Orange Coast College, who has monitored  the county's sea life for 22 years. "Everyone wants answers, but we don't have  them." Marla Cone and Steve Emmons  </P></p>

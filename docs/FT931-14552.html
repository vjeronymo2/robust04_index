			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / Minister will examine plans to save Bart's from closure DR BRIAN MAWHINNEY, the health minister, will this week visit St Bartholomew's hospital in the City of London to examine plans to save it from closure under the government's Tomlinson report proposals. An intense campaign to keep Bart's open has been mounted since October, when Sir Bernard Tomlinson's report recommended closure of the City site and amalgamation of services with the Royal London in the east end. The rescue plan devised by hospital managers envisages scaling down Bart's but retaining a range of specialist services including cardiac, cancer, renal and Aids; a healthcare centre for minor injuries and screening, and weekday accident and emergency services catering for 500,000 City workers. Dr Mawhinney visited all hospitals identified for closure or reorganisation before Christmas. The alternative proposal for Bart's had not been developed then, and he agreed to return when the hospital's managers had completed their plans. Department of Health officials stressed yesterday, however, that ministers had not yet made decisions on Bart's or any other Tomlinson recommendations. These decisions are likely next month. The Tomlinson proposals are intended to reduce hospital beds in the capital and switch resources to family doctors and community services. Sir Bernard's report did not include a financial analysis of his recommendations, and follow-up studies on financial implications commissioned by the Department of Health should reach the government this week. Ministers will then have to weigh the political unpopularity of closing hospitals with the financial consequences of keeping them open. The relatively expensive London teaching hospitals are subsidised in the NHS internal market.</p>

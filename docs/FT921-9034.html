			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / Arts: Chamber ensembles - St John's, Smith Square/Purcell Room Such is the demand for major artists that musical events are often planned a year or two in advance. It has taken that long for the economic slowdown to catch up with musical life in London, but the period since Christmas has been ominously quiet and there seems little doubt that recession has now arrived. In the circumstances one is even more grateful than usual for groups such as the Nash Ensemble and the younger Ondine, who rely upon a certain degree of adventure to keep up their momentum. At St John's, Smith Square the Nash presented two Russian programmes during the past week. According to a favourite recipe each was leavened with vocal items at its centre, but the real purpose was to provide a showcase for a pair of new Russian works. The first of these was a Nash Ensemble commission, Dedicase for flute, clarinet and string quartet by Edison Denisov. This was receiving its first performance. A single note is intoned and then the other instruments cluster around, pressing first above in pitch and then below, until gradually the scope is widened. A clear academic idea is at work here, but the music's most beguiling aspect is the way it combines string and wind sonorities, often in the same register, to produce some strange and beautiful sounds. At under 20 minutes, not a major premiere, but a pleasing one. Wherever Denisov is heard, the music of Elena Firsova is not usually far behind. Unlike her compatriot, Firsova has chosen to remain in Russia and yet her style admits even more of the cosmopolitan, often French influences than does his. At the second Nash Ensemble recital on Wednesday that was certainly the case with her Odyssey Op. 44, for mixed wind and string sextet with percussion. A delicately Gallic appreciation of sound was always to the fore, but there is a greater, more personal expressive content with Firsova and the music moved quickly through different phases. In this respect it was a journey, as its title implies, culminating in a visionary final section, where the music disappeared up and away into a mysterious ether of string harmonics, harp and bells. Like the strange traveller who commissioned the work, claiming it would be taken on a unique voyage by a lone rower from Russia to the US, and then went off never to be seen again. By crossing the river smartly from St John's I was able to follow the Firsova work (a first UK performance) with the second half of Ondine's French programme at the Purcell Room. This included a rare performance of Faure's song-cycle La Bonne Chanson in the arrangement which the composer made for string quartet and piano, only to regret the idea fairly soon afterwards. In fact, it worked well in this venue, the voice fairly easily audible, the strings (including the optional double-bass) adding an attractive depth of resonance. The soloist was the soprano Patricia Rozario, who has a nice mix of purity and heartwarming grace in her voice. As long as a stream of relaxed tone was called for, her singing was indeed wholly lovely, but there was not enough bite to the sound or a sufficient grip on the words to dig much deeper. An attractive programme nonetheless, decently well played, worth seeking out.</p>

			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / Observer: Bridge-building? Simon Keswick, Trafalgar House's new taipan, really must do his homework. Having made a hostile takeover bid for Newcastle's Northern Electric, the next move in his battle plan required him and his NCOs to enter enemy territory disguised as a local company. So yesterday saw Trafalgar's top brass having their photographs taken in front of the Tyne's bridges. Not only does Trafalgar House own 14 companies in the North East but one subsidiary is connected with three of the six bridges over the River Tyne. Two were built by Darlington-based Cleveland Structural Engineering and the most famous of them all, the Tyne Bridge, was erected by Dorman Long, acquired by Trafalgar House in 1982 and then combined with Cleveland. 'Wherever we go we feel you have got to be sensitive about people's culture,' says Keswick. How sad then that Trafalgar House's propaganda could not even get the dates right for the construction of Newcastle's most famous bridge. It was built between 1925 and 1929, not in 1920.</p>

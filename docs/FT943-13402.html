			<p>940720 FT  20 JUL 94 / A changing Taiwan wants welfare without the tears: Traditional care systems need replacing but policymakers want to avoid the west's mistakes Like its east Asian neighbours, Taiwan is grappling with how to balance the growing need for social services such as healthcare and old-age support against fears of turning its vibrant economy into a hypertaxed welfare state. Taiwan's parliament yesterday approved a universal health insurance scheme which is due to come into effect from January. And the establishment of a national pension scheme is to top the legislative agenda during the autumn session. The health scheme will be state-run and will be 90 per cent financed by employer and employee contributions, with the state picking up the rest. Total healthcare expenditure is projected to be NTDollars 270bn (Pounds 6.5bn) in the first year. Taiwan is going the way of most industrialised countries. Rising incomes, shifting demographics and changing social structures are straining the capacity of traditional family-based care. And with per capita gross national product having risen from Dollars 145 in 1951 to more than Dollars 11,000 this year, there is more money around to pay for good care than there are opportunities to get it. In 1993 existing government-run health, labour and retirement insurance schemes covered just more than half Taiwan's population of nearly 21m. In recent months, Taiwan's medical establishment has been rocked by a spate of scandals revealing the widespread practice among doctors, whose salaries are low by most comparable countries' standards, of accepting bribes for services. Entrepreneurial solutions have emerged to fill the void left by a government struggling to keep up with the welfare demands of an industrialised society. But Taiwan, which prides itself on having probably the most equitable distribution of wealth among Asian countries, is anxious not to allow quality health services to become the preserve of the rich. Under the state-run health insurance scheme, employers will pay 60 per cent of their employees' premiums and the employees 30 per cent. The state will pick up the remaining 10 per cent as well as the administrative costs. But the government's burden will be significantly higher because it must subsidise a large part of the premiums, including those for government employees, veterans, the self-employed and low-income groups. Mr Chan Huo-sheng of National Taiwan University's graduate institute of sociology is pessimistic about the health plan, which he describes as a hybrid version of the US, Canadian and British systems. 'Based on my experience in Britain, I am very much in favour of universal health insurance. The difference is in Britain, general practitioners are government employees. But here doctors are privately employed and the hospitals are privately run. 'So doctors, who are a powerful pressure group, will be bargaining with the government over fees and services,' Mr Chan argues. 'And here we don't have a strong sense of ethics in the medical profession. There are problems with wastage of resources, problems with hong bao' - red envelopes - a reference to the institutionalised bribery of doctors for preferential services. In the absence of a mechanism to keep a lid on the costs of providing healthcare, expenditures will escalate endlessly, the government will be forced to shoulder a heavier burden and taxpayers will have to pay more to keep the system afloat in what will became a vicious circle, he predicts. The ruling Nationalist party wanted to push the programme through quickly for political reasons without subjecting it to sufficient debate and study, says legislator Parris Chang of the leading opposition party, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). Demographic forces are also driving the need for a modern national old-age pension scheme. The country's population growth rate fell below 1 per cent in 1993 for the first time and is projected to reach zero in 2035. At the same time the population is greying rapidly. The median age is forecast to rise to 42.6 in 2036 from 28.6 in 1993, and the percentage of the population aged 65 and over to 21.57 from 6.93. The tradition of extended multi-generational families living under one roof is fast giving way to the nuclear family, leaving greater numbers of the elderly to fend for themselves on a day-to-day basis. Mr Chen Chao-nan, a researcher at the Academia Sinica, a government think-tank, estimates that one-third of Taiwanese 65 and older now live alone, twice as many as in the mid-1970s. In addition, women - historically the primary carers - have entered the labour force in unprecedented numbers. In 1992 women made up 37.7 per cent of the workforce, compared with 27 per cent in 1965. 'Basically we're seeing a sharp reduction in informal social support systems,' said Mr Chen. 'In addition to national health insurance, we need home care systems and nursing homes for those elderly whose family are no longer able to physically care for them.' The DPP has proposed a pension scheme loosely modelled on the American social security system, under which workers would pay into the scheme and begin collecting once they reached 65. Under existing comprehensive schemes, covered workers receive a lump sum payout upon retirement. The ruling party has yet to produce its own pension plan proposal, but it is likely to be similar to the DPP's. 'Both parties favour self-financing systems, as they fear too much government intervention will lead to waste and inefficiency,' says Mr Ho Dwanfan, director of the DPP's social issues department. 'The widely held view is that welfare will make people lazy. Everyone is very much afraid of becoming like Britain - the economy goes downhill and everybody blames the welfare system.'

			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / UK looking to Latin America The visit to Colombia by Mr John Major, the first to South America by a serving British prime minister, reflects a decision to assign more importance to Latin America in British foreign policy, according to UK officials, writes Stephen Fidler, Latin America Editor. The increased interest in the region represented 'a new departure in foreign policy', according to a senior official. Three government ministers, including foreign secretary Douglas Hurd, who visited Mexico last month, have already been to Latin America this year. The move follows the shift to democracy by Latin governments and their abandonment of the import-substitution model of economic development, which had damaged trade relations. Now there was a convergence of interest between Britain and Latin America, the officials said. The success of liberal, market-friendly economic policies were already apparent in Mexico, Chile, Venezuela, Colombia and Argentina. Mr Major will visit Cartagena, Bogota and the Cusiana oil field before flying to the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro late on Wednesday. It is not his first visit to Colombia; he was there in 1984 as a government whip. Mrs Margaret Thatcher attended the North/South summit in Cancun, Mexico, in 1981 but this was not an official visit to Mexico.</p>

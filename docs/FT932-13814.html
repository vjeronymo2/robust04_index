			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Balladur may urge pay cut The French prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, may call on his ministers to set an example of austerity by taking a 10 per cent pay cut, the government confirmed yesterday, writes David Buchan in Paris. Mr Balladur has already told ministers to put on a 'hair shirt' by cutting entertainment and travel costs. Mr Nicholas Sarkozy, the budget minister and official government spokesman, said that when the government was weighing new taxes and asking for public sacrifice to stem the ballooning budget deficit, 'it is quite natural that those demanding such efforts should set an example'. French cabinet ministers earn a basic FFr45,000 (Pounds 5,440) a month, but get fringe benefits which in some cases include housing. Mr Sarkozy, who is charged with finding an immediate FFr20bn budget saving, said he could not exclude a freeze on civil service pay as well. Some 40 per cent of the budget goes in pay, he said, and this could not be regarded as untouchable.</p>

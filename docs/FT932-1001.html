			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Japan urged to cut trade surplus: Commission joins US in calling for clear timetable from Tokyo THE European Commission yesterday joined the US in calling on Japan to set a clear target and timetable for reducing its trade surplus which could reach Dollars 150bn (Pounds 100bn) this year. The Commission shared the US view that Japan's trade surplus as a proportion of gross national product was so substantial that it was a destabilising factor in world trade, Sir Leon Brittan, EC commissioner for external economic affairs, said in Tokyo. Sir Leon said: 'The EC, like the US, has a real problem with the Japanese trade surplus. We would agree with the US that the percentage of GNP represented by the trade surplus is excessive and should be reduced.' The Japanese surplus is likely to reach about 3.5 per cent of Japanese gross national product this year, largely because slow growth in Japan has depressed demand for imports. A senior US administration official said a cut to 1.5 per cent of GNP would create more than 1m jobs elsewhere in the world economy. Hundreds of thousands of the jobs would be in the US. The official said the political turmoil in Japan after the government's defeat in a no-confidence motion last Friday would not lead the US to back off from its demands that the Japanese agree to measureable targets to reduce the surplus. He said: 'Continuity in our strategic and security relationship with Japan requires discontinuity in our economic relations, with a fundamental change in the way Japan relates to the world.' The US and Japan will meet over the weekend to draw up a framework for talks on issues such as access to the Japanese market and reduction of the surplus over the next three years. The EC wants the surplus reduced more quickly. Sir Leon said: 'We think it is necessary to have some kind of yardstick that can be applied sooner than three years.' The administration official said recent pump-priming measures by the Japanese government had only prevented a further tightening of fiscal policy at a time when Japan and the world economy was already suffering from a deficiency of domestic demand. He denied the US was seeking managed trade agreements which would specify a share of the Japanese market for foreign suppliers. Instead, he said, the US would look at a range of measures such as the rate of growth of imports, comparisons of foreign market share between Japan and other markets, the representation of foreign interests on standard setting bodies and the scale of foreign investment in manufacturing industry.

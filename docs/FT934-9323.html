			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Budget 1993: Small-business sector steps up its demands - Kenneth Clarke has been urged to boost the supply of equity finance and bank credit SMALL businesses and their lobby organisations have never been slow to come forward with advice for the chancellor at Budget time. The run-up to the second of two Budgets this year on November 30 is no exception. Requests for changes to legislation have flooded in to the Treasury. The most pressing concern is whether finance will be available for businesses as they emerge from recession. The Treasury and the Bank of England are independently looking at the availability of equity finance and bank credit. It may be hard for Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, to influence the attitude of banks towards lending. But small businesses believe there is one tax measure that could significantly improve the supply of equity at little cost to the Treasury - a new Business Expansion Scheme. The present scheme has been discredited because it attracted so much capital to Assured Tenancy Schemes - relatively risk-free property deals. But it has channelled new equity into productive business expansion. The British Venture Capital Association, anxious to prevent the government throwing the baby out with the bathwater, wants a scheme that ensures tax relief is provided only for genuine risk capital. Companies involved in property, financial services and investments such as wine would be excluded; the limit should be raised from Pounds 750,000 to Pounds 1m; and the limit for each individual investor should be raised from Pounds 40,000 to Pounds 100,000 in any one year. The Small Business Bureau is more specific. It would like to see equity channelled to smaller manufacturing companies and tax relief for investments of up to Pounds 250,000 a year. Both versions are based on the idea that wealthy individuals will need tax relief up-front if they are to participate in risky investments. There are, however, proposals for a widening of the scope of personal equity plans, where the tax advantages are deferred. The Venture Capital Association, for example, wants qualifying UK investors to be able to put money in investment funds for unquoted companies. At the moment, Peps are available only for quoted investments. The association would like to see its proposal stand with quoted company Peps. It also wants a limit of Pounds 100,000 a year for investments in general investment plans, or a single company Pep. Allowing this size of investment in single company Peps would facilitate investment by the so-called 'Business Angels' who not only want to invest, but would like some form of non-executive involvement. The Confederation of British Industry approaches the same problem from a slightly different viewpoint, calling for up-front tax relief for personal income invested in business assets - similar to the relief that is applied to private pension scheme contributions. Some want to see a change in capital gains tax which, among its faults, makes no differentiation between short- and long-term capital gains. This tends to focus investors on a quest for income today rather than future capital growth. It also tends to work against entrepreneurs and individuals who are sitting on unrealised capital gain in a quoted portfolio or unquoted investment. These investors currently find a 40 per cent CGT rate a substantial barrier to selling investments to reinvest in unquoted companies, becoming a so-called 'serial investor'. The Venture Capital Association wants to extend rollover tax relief to cover capital gains earned on quoted shares as long as the proceeds are reinvested in an unquoted company within six months. Equally important to smaller businesses are some other familiar themes. Prominent in a submission from the Forum of Private Business, for example, is a call for statutory interest penalties for the late payment of debt. The forum is also calling for an integration of national insurance and PAYE, to cut paperwork, as well as a reduction in National Insurance which it sees as a tax on jobs. It wants a reform of the uniform business rate, which it says places an unjust burden on the shoulders of small businesses. Small businesses generally believe they had a fair hearing and a 'good' March Budget. But many say that if the government is attempting to create the environment for a true enterprise economy there is much more to be done.</p>

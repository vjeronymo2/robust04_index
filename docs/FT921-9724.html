			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Unctad sees hope for world's poorest states THE economic outlook for the world's poorest countries is tinged with hope, even optimism, after years of gloom, according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad). In its latest annual report on the least developed countries (LDCs) published today, Unctad says the positive outlook reflects the relatively high growth rates achieved by some LDCs in recent years and, 'above all', the changed international political and economic climate. The prospects for the settlement of many long-standing wars and conflicts - affecting one in four LDCs since 1990 - are much brighter today, Unctad notes. The resulting peace dividend 'will come in the form of a redirection of national efforts and resources away from military pursuits, the removal of the burden of hundreds of thousands of refugees on neighbouring countries, the repatriation of flight capital and skills, and improved conditions for agricultural production.' Other hopeful signs include widespread political reform and democratisation movements, and major changes in domestic economic policies to support viable long-term growth. The report looks at the economic performance during the 1980s of 42 of the 47 countries classified by the UN as least-developed (with a per capita income of Dollars 600 (Pounds 330) in 1987). Eleven managed to boost per capita GDP by at least 10 per cent, with overall GDP increasing by nearly 6 per cent a year in 1980-89, while six others registered positive but slower growth. However, LDCs suffered from the world economic slowdown in 1990 and 1991, with negative or negligible per capita GDP growth. In Africa, real GDP growth turned negative in 1990, after a sharp fall in agricultural production. In addition, Unctad notes, several LDCs such as Samoa and Bangladesh have recently been struck by natural disasters. Man-made disasters have proved equally devastating. In Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Liberia and Somalia, development has been halted by civil strife. Only 13 of the LDCs enjoyed basic peace and stability throughout the 1980s. LDCs are also home to almost 80 per cent of the world's 17m refugees, with the biggest concentration in the Horn of Africa. The report calls on the industrialised world to boost aid flows to the poorest countries, to do more on debt relief and to give LDCs preferential trade treatment.</p>

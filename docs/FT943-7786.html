			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Sport: Budgeting for a broken leg - Football / Jane Whitehead shares pillow talk with West Ham's finance director Last night I went to bed with the financial controller of a Premier League football club. He had a headache, again. It is 2 1/2 years since my partner, Richard Skirrow combined his professional qualifications with his passion for sport. Relinquishing his role of finance director in the unexciting adhesive tape industry in Manchester, he travelled south to the allegedly twilit world of football finance. As a new season begins, I asked this down to earth, honest, Yorkshireman how he finds life in a business so often tainted with tales of corruption, con men and brown paper parcels bulging with cash. 'One big difference between this job and the 'real world', is that in industry for instance, if you are going to spend Pounds 1m on a major asset you would know exactly what you were getting for your money. You would set the specifications, compare all the products available, and buy with a warranty. In football you spend Pounds 1m on a player, and you get no guarantee of a half decent return on that expenditure, definitely no warranty, no replacement parts available and you cannot send him back.' Last summer, Pounds 1.25m brought two new players to Richard's club West Ham United. One, Simon Webster, broke a leg and has yet to play; the other, Dale Gordon, suffered a knee injury and has managed only 10 games. Because of the hefty premiums, neither was insured. Of this summer's Pounds 1.75m purchases, one, John Moncur, missed the pre-season tour with an injury, the other, Joe Beauchamp, decided he would prefer to play elsewhere and was sold to Swindon on Wednesday. 'It is the unpredictability that makes life so fascinating.' says Skirrow. 'Take budgeting for a cup run, for instance. If you take the conservative attitude and do not budget for any sort of cup success then you are in danger of underestimating how much money you may earn. Therefore you do not spend it, you do not buy the new player, you have a poorer side. It becomes self-fulfilling and you get knocked out early on. 'Equally if you are tempted to budget for a long cup run and spend accordingly you may still get knocked out in your first game, you have not got that income you were expecting but you have already spent it on a player and you are up queer street.' West Ham do not have the luxury of a 'sugar daddy'. All spending money has to be generated from trading profits and bank loans. 'We find the current level of players' wages crippling, but we have to pay them because of market forces in the industry. Clubs such as Manchester United, who are making money from huge crowds, frequent TV appearances and a massive commercial operation, will, quite rightly, want to ensure they do not lose their top players to European clubs, hence they will pay them a phenomenal amount of money. To keep team spirit, the rest of the squad will be paid well. 'Smaller clubs, who want to retain their star players have to pay comparable wages. There are few clubs who can cope easily.' There has been extra financial pressure on clubs to conform to the strict requirements of the Taylor Report to make stadiums all seated. 'Most clubs have, in the past, spent money on the team first, and the stadium second. Many fans, would far rather have a good team winning matches, in average stadiums with indifferent facilities, than have a spanking new stadium with piping hot soup and a team that is going nowhere. But safety must be the priority and now football has been forced to spend money on the facilities and it has been very expensive indeed. 'We received Pounds 2m grant aid from the Football Trust, towards the redevelopment of our south stand. An immense help.' West Ham's priorities are to have sufficient money to complete the ground redevelopment, meet interest commitments and repayments on borrowings and create some surplus for the manager to spend. 'You can set a certain figure for spending on transfers but then perhaps the manager has spent it all and you still look as if you have a team that is going to struggle, which is what happened last season. So you look at it all again, try and be a bit more optimistic - bigger average crowds, an extra round in the cup - and perhaps convince yourself the risk is worth taking.' Income for clubs outside the Premier League is vastly reduced, so avoiding relegation is becoming more and more important. 'Unfortunately the rich are getting richer and the poorer are falling further behind. Even this league is geared to the successful getting more financially rewards than those less successful.' The Premier League TV money is split, in part, on a ladder principle. The top club receives 22 shares and the club at the bottom gets one share. Each share is worth Pounds 40,000. The top teams are more likely to be chosen for live Sky TV games and a Pounds 70,000 fee. The headaches? 'Bearable, so long as we are still in the Premiership this time next season.'</p>

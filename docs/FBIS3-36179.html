			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Petr Zhuravlev, Dmitriy Kuznets report under the "Duma" </F> rubric: "Authorities Tired of Truce. Deputies Dream of Rights  and Supreme Soviet Property"]    [Text] A draft declaration on the new Russian parliament's  right of succession as the country's top legislative body is  supposed to be submitted to the upcoming plenary session of the  State Duma on 4 February. The draft is being submitted on  behalf of the Duma committee on legislation while its direct  author, to all appearances, is committee head Vladimir Isakov.    It is supposed, first and foremost, that the declaration  will  be a joint document of the State Duma and the Federation Council  which, "recognizing the historical responsibility for the fate  of parliamentarianism and expressing anxiety at the state of the  legal system" of the country, state their claim to the entire  legacy of the Congress and the Supreme Soviet of the Russian  Federation. True, the greater part of the powers of soviets is  recognized as forfeited, and the right of succession is being  declared only to that part which "does not contravene the  Constitution of the Russian Federation."    All the laws passed by the Supreme Soviet that do not  contravene the Constitution are recognized as "having the same  juridical power" as the laws passed by the Duma. As for edicts,  Mr. Isakov here goes back to his pet idea of ousting the  president and the government from the realm of lawmaking.  Edicts and "other normative acts" contravening laws passed by  the Supreme Soviet and the Federal Assembly are proposed to be  recognized invalid.    Claims to "rights of succession" in the legislative sphere,  however, is not the whole story. The present deputies also long  for the Supreme Soviet's and the Congress' property.  Considering the current problem of accommodation for the  parliament, one can suppose that what they have in mind first  and foremost is the building at 2 Krasnopresnenskaya  Naberezhnaya, and only then do they have in mind the car pool,  the vacation home, and so forth. In addition to the White  House, parliamentarians are showing a certain interest in the  mass media founders rights remaining from the Supreme Soviet,  and in that body's right to representation in international  organizations.    To be quite fair, it is necessary to say that following a  long process of approvals and introduction of amendments, the  text would probably lose much of its bite. But it is simply  impossible to describe the draft declaration as the first attack  "along the president-parliament front of the new convocation."    One can only add that the above draft does not quite  correspond to the Constitution, which specifies that parliament  passes "laws and decrees," and there is no mention of any  declarations. Besides, Mr. Isakov's intention to reduce  presidential edicts to the level of economic management  directives does not agree with the text passed on 12 December.  At any rate, the Duma bloc of Communists and Agrarians, to  which Vladimir Isakov belongs, is known for its program  aspiration to dispute the referendum results.</p>

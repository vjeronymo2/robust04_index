			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / 'Wise men' look for a tighter fiscal policy The surprise half-point cut in interest rates yesterday was a sage move, according to most of the chancellor's seven independent advisers. But they will greet failure by Mr Kenneth Clarke to match it with a stiff tightening of fiscal policy next week less harmoniously. For Professor Wynne Godley of Cambridge University the move fits in with his radical revised interpretation of what is the right policy mix for the economy. Prof Godley is worried about the ratio of consumption to GDP in the third quarter - at a record high when it is meas-ured in constant prices. 'In view of the latest figures it is probably right to cut interest rates and increase taxes with the strategic objective of cutting consumption as a share of GDP and hopefully replacing it with exports and investment,' Prof Godley said. Earlier this year he cautioned against a rise in taxes, believing that this would smother the recovery. Prof Patrick Minford of Liverpool University also believes the recovery may waver but says monetary easing, rather than fiscal tightening, is the answer to the economy's problems. He said: 'I'm pleased, but we need more monetary easing to head off the possibility that the recovery may be faltering. In my view the government will be impelled to announce another half-point cut by the end of the year.' Mr Andrew Sentance, head of economics at the Confederation of British Industry, said: 'This is a step in the right direction. It reflects the low numbers coming in for inflation and the fact that the recovery is less than robust.' He would like to see a further cut in rates to 5 per cent by the end of the year. Mr Gavyn Davies, the City voice of the seven wise men, believes this will be the last rate cut of the year, with the government leaving scope for another 50-basis-point cut in the first or second quarter of next year, once the impact of tighter fiscal policy on the recovery became clearer. He added: 'I don't think the cut means much in terms of the size of budget tightening because I don't think it was going to be very significant anyway.' Another strategic element of the rate cut was the need to bring down interest rates before the spring, when changes to various administered prices will start to push the retail prices index, excluding mortgage interest payments, towards the upper limit of its 1 per cent to 4 per cent target range. Mr Davies said: 'I don't think the government will ease monetary policy while the monetary targets are under any threat at all.' Mr Andrew Britton, director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, said that the half-point reduction could be construed as compensating for the modest fiscal tightening that seemed likely in next week's Budget. He said that by leaving the Bank to announce the details of the cut in borrowing rates, the government was 'acknowledging the Bank's wish to become more independent'.</p>

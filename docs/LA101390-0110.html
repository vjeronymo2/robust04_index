			<p><P> October 13, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TEACHER FACING DISCIPLINE OVER MOVIE;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: "QUEST FOR FIRE", AN R-RATED FILM WITH SEX AND CANNIBALISM SCENES  WAS SCREENED FOR SEVENTH-GRADE SOCIAL STUDIES CLASS.  </P> <P> School officials are considering disciplinary action against a teacher who  showed an edited version of "Quest for Fire," an R-rated caveman movie with sex  and cannibalism scenes, to a seventh-grade social studies class.  </P> <P> The Conejo Valley Unified School District learned of the screening at the  Sequoia Intermediate School after parents complained, a school official said  Friday.  </P> <P> The 1982 movie was not approved by a district committee that normally reviews  all sex education films, said Richard Simpson, an assistant superintendent for  instructional services.  </P> <P> Simpson said it should have been submitted to that committee because of scenes  revealing nudity, even though it was not intended as a sex education film. He  also said parents should have been told that the film would be shown.  </P> <P> The film apparently was shown in connection with lessons on history and social  science.  </P> <P> The scenes in the edited version shown to the classroom included "scenes of  violence. There are scenes that suggest cannibalism. There are scenes that  suggest sexual activity," Simpson said.  </P> <P> District officials will decide what action to take against the teacher next  week, he said.  </P> <P> Because the incident is a personnel matter, Simpson declined to name the  teacher. But parents identified him as Clint Dillon, a social studies  instructor who has been at the school for two years. Dillon declined to be  interviewed.  </P> <P> Two teachers showed a different, edited-for-television version of the film to  two 10th-grade world history classes at Newbury Park High School, Principal  Charles Eklund said.  </P> <P> "Quest for Fire" was directed by Jean-Jacques Annaud and stars actors Ron  Perlman and Rae Dawn Chong as prehistoric lovers. Movie critics lauded the  French-Canadian film for its special effects, calling it one of the most  realistic portrayals of a caveman and his search for fire.  </P> <P> But the special effects disturbed parents of Sequoia school children, eight of  whom complained to the school district, Simpson said.  </P> <P> Teresa Muse, 37, whose 12-year-old daughter Danielle saw the movie along with a  class of about 30, said she was shocked by her daughter's graphic description  of dismemberment, violence and nudity.  </P> <P> "There was this man and this woman and they were naked and tied up and hanging  upside down. The man's arm was ripped off and a group of cannibals was eating  his arm," Muse said. "When she came home, she was sick to her stomach. This  movie really bothered her."  </P> <P> Other parents told Muse that their children also described the film as  sickening, and one child had nightmares of cannibals, Muse said.  </P></p>

			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Commission plan a threat to UK export finance Sir, Little noticed by the vast majority of UK exporters, a far-reaching European Commission communication is in danger of slipping through this summer which will put them at a severe disadvantage compared with their European competitors. The Commission understandably wants to eliminate distortion of trade within Europe by cutting government involvement in that vital safeguard against bad debts: short-term credit insurance. The effect of the competition directorate's latest draft, however, will be to ban a large part of the present arrangements whereby the UK government gives reinsurance support in certain critical areas of short-term risk, helping to protect more than Pounds 15bn UK exports each year, including luxury cars, textiles and advanced electronic equipment. At best the ban will mean extreme uncertainty for exporters while UK credit insurers restructure their reinsurance. At worst it will mean they will have a substantial part of their credit insurance support withdrawn altogether. This will affect not only export orders but jobs. It is not that the UK is again being difficult about its European relationships. It is that our system of short-term credit insurance is significantly different from theirs since the private market now provides virtually all credit insurance support in the UK. Ironically, we have gone further than anybody in removing government support; yet the Commission's proposals will damage the remaining necessary government reinsurance in certain areas while allowing the French and German governments to continue to provide large-scale support for their monopoly state providers. It is to be hoped that the British government will once again stand firm. Keith Hampson, member of trade and industry select committee, House of Commons, London SW1A 0AA</p>

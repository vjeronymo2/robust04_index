			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Survey of Computers in Finance (6): Traditionalists addicted to paper and ink - Lloyd's underwriters take their time over computerisation UNDERWRITERS at the 300 year old Lloyd's of London insurance market are overcoming their scepticism about new new technology but the journey from traditional methods of trading to the electronic marketplace is proving painfully slow. Little progress has been made so far in either placing business or in processing claims electronically. And brokers perceive Lloyd's to be lagging behind its rivals in the company market. Yet there is a growing realisation among the market's underwriters that new technology must be embraced. A Lloyd's syndicate was one of the first insurers to underwrite a risk electronically when the electronic placing support (EPS) initiative came on stream in the London market earlier this year. So far, though, only 20 agencies of the 100 or so managing syndicates trading in the market this year have equipped their syndicates to trade electronically via the a system called electronic placing support. Many older underwriters have yet to overcome their fear of new technology. Only a handful of personal accident and reinsurance deals have been placed electronically up to now. Mr Terry Hayday, the chairman of the Lloyd's Network Steering Group which co-ordinates the activities of Limnet at Lloyd's, explains that electronic placement has always been designed to support rather than replace the traditional face to face negotiations between underwriters and brokers. 'We are well aware that the penny has only just dropped that electronic support means just what it says,' says Mr Hayday. Even so, there is widespread scepticism on the market, especially among underwriters whose main business is underwriting more complex individual risks. 'It is not going very far. I'm a bit cynical about it The market as a whole seems to be labouring with it,' says Mr Mark Bodkin, an underwriter with one of the market's biggest syndicates, Cater Allen 190. 'It is not really relevant for the business we underwrite. We require a lot of information. You can get far more out of a broker than you can from black and white numbers on a screen,' adds Mr Bodkin. Mr Hayday accepts that the initiative has been launched at a bad time, with many syndicates hard-pressed for cash. Even though connection costs have fallen over the past few months, Mr Hayday accepts that underwriters 'are naturally understandably reluctant to commit themselves until they know what the volumes going through the system will be. 'In today's environment where there is great emphasis on cost cutting it is difficult to persuade people. For a number of people whose syndicates may not be around next year it is not the highest priority.' Lloyd's has made less progress in another area of electronic trading, that of claims processing. Insurance companies who are members of the Institute of London Underwriters and London Insurance and Reinsurance Market Association are already processing more than 50 per cent of their claims payments electronically. By contrast the Lloyd's market has only just begun to rationalise its existing paper-based claims handling systems. Until July this year, claims that were paid by the market's marine, non-marine and aviation underwriters were all processed by separate offices. The recently established unified claims office has yet to introduce an electronic claims system, although it is launching a pilot scheme at the end of next March and, at present, it envisages the introduction of a full scale system in 1994. More progress has been made in a third EDI application, for processing reinsurance recoveries. Underwriters are probably more optimistic about Lloyd's possibilities in this area than any other. Mr Richard Holliday, of syndicate 40, for example, believes that the LORS system will greatly add to the market's efficiency and bring immediate benefits to individual underwriters. 'The cost of generating reinsurance recoveries will fall. At the moment there are mountains of reinsurance credit and debit notes floating around,' says Mr Holliday. 'The new system will help with cash flow.' In spite of the doubts, though, everyone recognises that Lloyd's must come to terms with new technology. 'I think there is an awareness that we have to wake up to new technology,' he adds. Mr Phillip Davies, of the Octavian Agency, whose syndicates have been among those linking up to the electronic placing support system, summarises the mood. He says that his underwriters regularly check the system but rarely find any business is being offered. 'It's is a bit like when fax machines started. Somebody had to start getting them.'</p>

Defense  Minister Rafael Pardo and Air Force Commander Major General  Alfonso Abondano commented on this topic today at a military  ceremony.    During the ceremony to commemorate the 87th anniversary of  the Cadets Military Academy, in addition to the traditional  speeches and parades, there was time to discuss the U.S. radar  dispute. Amid a downpour that resembled the storm now brewing  in the country following the Pentagon's orders to suspend the  operation of the two radar installations, Pardo discounted the  U.S. position on whether or not unidentified planes should be  shot down.    [Begin Pardo recording] The thing we oppose is that this  decision was made unilaterally, despite the fact that this  cooperation program has been in place for three years and that  it has been a multilateral program. [end recording]    According to the defense minister, Colombia will continue to  shoot down unidentified drug planes, and this policy will not  change.    [Begin Pardo recording] Colombia has assumed this position  following a thorough, 18-month legal review. We are very much  convinced that our interpretation is correct, and we sincerely  believe we have nothing to change in this regard. [end recording]    Meanwhile, the Colombian Air Force says the chances of a  U.S.  military plane being shot down are remote.    [Begin Abondano recording] We identify all planes visually  before our pilots are authorized to shoot. [end recording]</p>

			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Cut down to size A quarter-point cut in the base rate was baffling after last week's upbeat economic report from the Treasury. After last night's inflation report from the Bank of England, it is even more so. Though the report expresses satisfaction with the underlying fall in inflation, it attributes a large part to the one-off effect of supermarket price cutting. It contains nothing which calls out for an immediate fall in rates. Indeed, it suggests that a rise in underlying inflation is more likely than a further fall. Against that backdrop, markets were left groping for an explanation for the rate cut. The more it pondered, the more worried the gilts market became. Long issues lost all their early gains and more. The natural temptation was to assume that the main motivation was political. The government faces difficult local and European elections in May and the prime minister has said he expects Tory support to revive as voters see the economy recover. He cannot risk the elections coinciding with a fresh economic slowdown induced by April's tax increases. Such an interpretation is impossible to prove. But in the absence of anything better, it is likely to stick. For its part, the Bank seemed prepared to accept a quarter-point cut on the basis that it was better to be safe than sorry about the impact of the tax increases, but it was adamant in seeing no justification for a half-point cut. Perhaps the quarter point was a compromise, but the fact that rates are moving in such small stages suggests they must be near their trough. That is a bitter pill for the gilts market, especially if politics are influencing monetary policy. Sterling's sharp fall against the dollar last night reinforced the belief that US investors were moving on from gilts. The government cannot afford to see them go. It still has a lot of paper to sell.</p>

			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Philips in black but omits dividend PHILIPS, the Dutch electronics group, swung back into profit in 1991, the first full year of its far-reaching restructuring efforts, but the company omitted the dividend for the second year running. Net profit totalled Fl 981m (Pounds 302m) in 1991 compared with a net loss of Fl 4.53bn in 1990, when heavy restructuring provisions produced the biggest corporate loss in Dutch history. Operating profit, excluding restructuring costs in both years, rose by 35 per cent to Fl 3bn. Mr Jan Timmer, president, said that the increase in operating profits had been satisfactory but also noted that the company had faced disappointments and setbacks in its consumer electronics division. He declined to comment on when Philips would resume dividend payments. He also warned that increases in turnover and net profit from normal business operations would be limited in 1992 because an economic revival in many industrialised countries was not expected before the end of the year. In particular, there was little prospect of a recovery in the first quarter of this year in the consumer electronics division, the only core sector which did not see a profit increase in 1991. Operating profits in the consumer division, which was severely hit by continuing recession in leading markets, fell to Fl 1.01bn from Fl 1.50bn in 1990. However, Mr Timmer sounded a positive note on the impact of the restructuring programme. During 1991, Philips divested companies with combined turnover of Fl 2.2bn and cut 32,800 jobs, in line with forecasts. 'We are not dissatisfied with what we have achieved,' he said, but added that the company was 'still far removed from where we want to be'. Redundancies would continue to be necessary, but not to the same degree as in 1991. Philips intended to continue disposing of non-core businesses and those which did not meet performance targets. However, Mr Timmer said he did not plan to sell entire divisions - such as semi-conductors, communications or medical technology - or to reduce the group's stake in PolyGram, its 80 per cent-owned music company. The sale of Philips' mini-computer activities to Digital of the US helped account for the sharp rise in operating income in professional products and systems.</p>

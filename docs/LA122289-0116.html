			<p><P> December 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. APPAREL MAKERS HANG BY A THREAD;  </P> <P> MANUFACTURING: BIG RETAILERS' WOES ARE SPREADING TO LOCAL GARMENT MAKERS, WHO  ARE CUTTING PRODUCTION AND LAYING OFF WORKERS. SMALL CONTRACTORS ARE HARDEST  HIT.  </P> <P> The ills afflicting the nation's major retailers are also hitting the Los  Angeles apparel industry hard, throwing many workers out of their jobs and  apparently putting some manufacturers and contractors in jeopardy.  </P> <P> "It's a very shaky situation," said Menachem Treivush, head of a Los Angeles  firm that produces apparel under the Ton Sur Ton and Bonney Strauss labels.  </P> <P> From 1985 to 1987, apparel and textile production boomed in Los Angeles County,  and the industry cemented its position as the area's No. 2 manufacturing  employer. But now, jobs are being lost even as Los Angeles emerges as a fashion  design center.  </P> <P> The latest figures show that the county's apparel and textile manufacturing  employment in October totaled 87,600. That number has crept up somewhat from  the annual summer doldrums, but it is down 2,200 from October, 1988, and off  6,100 from October, 1987. Nationally, the job total has fallen a gradual 8%  over the past five years.  </P> <P> Some analysts say the local employment figure has declined partly because of  the movement of more apparel workers into underground sweatshops where,  unreported to government authorities, illegal immigrants and other employees  are paid exploitatively low wages.  </P> <P> But industry observers said there also has been a downturn recently in Los  Angeles' apparel industry because of the financial struggles of Campeau Corp.  and other major retailers, along with rising imports and expectations of  slowing sales to consumers.  </P> <P> Those developments have dealt another blow to a local industry that, analysts  say, was stung earlier by the loss of many apparel workers because of the  nation's immigration reform law and the increase in California's minimum wage.  </P> <P> Probably those hardest hit have been the hundreds of small contractors,  typically employing no more than 50 or 60 people, that are the backbone of the  apparel industry. Joseph Rodriguez, executive director of the Garment  Contractors Assn. of Southern California, said "dozens" of firms in his  association have laid off, or shortened the work weeks of, employees who sew or  cut fabric.  </P> <P> "Some (contractors) are even considering selling," Rodriguez said. "They're  scrambling around. Business is not good in the contracting world."  </P> <P> The list of victims also includes the likes of Jody Apparel, a dress  manufacturer that is scheduled to close in January after 27 years in business.  As recently as two years ago, it reported annual sales of $50 million and 250  employees.  </P> <P> Roger Miller, the Southern California regional manager for the California  Division of Labor Standards, said the downturn has sparked more complaints to  his agency. For example, Miller said, there has been a big rise in the past few  months in the number of apparel-sewing contractors alleging that they are not  being paid by their customers, the so-called manufacturing firms that actually  design and market clothing.  </P> <P> Other contractors, Miller said, complain that they are being put under extra  pressure to hold down costs. "It's leaving a lot of contractors in a bind," he  said.  </P> <P> Miller said his office also was contacted this month by two groups, each  consisting of about 20 to 30 apparel workers, who claimed that they had not  been paid by their employers for two or three weeks.  </P> <P> The most recent tremor to shake the local apparel industry has been the  decision by a growing number of credit companies, known as factors, to stop  approving garment makers' shipments to Bloomingdale's and other department  stores owned by Toronto-based Campeau. Over the past week, the nation's two  biggest factors -- CIT Group/Factoring and Heller Financial -- have halted  credit for new orders to the far-flung Campeau chains.  </P> <P> The factors, which collect payments for apparel makers and absorb the losses  when bills are not paid, have acted out of fear that the Campeau stores are  going broke. Campeau, wobbling under $10.9 billion in long-term debt mainly  from takeovers, disclosed last week that its department store operations --  Federated Department Stores and Allied Stores -- might seek Chapter 11  bankruptcy court protection by the end of next month to work out their  problems.  </P> <P> Many apparel manufacturers, consequently, are withholding merchandise and  cutting production rather than bear the risk of shipping goods without  protection from their factors.  </P> <P> "All the mergers that took place, we're paying for today," said Dina Bar-El,  co-owner of Hi-Tech Fashions, a women's sportswear maker that over the past  year has cut its staff from 38 to 25 people.  </P> <P> Added Corky Newman, president of corporate marketing and licensing for  Sunland-based Cherokee Group: "The factor allows us to ship X amount, and  that's what we ship. We're a highly profitable company, and we're a highly  disciplined company.  </P> <P> "There are certain risks you take in business every day. There are other risks  that, percentage-wise, never pay off," Newman said. "And when it's in the  papers that a company is talking about bankruptcy, we'll listen to the factors.  </P> <P> "What today's business environment proves," Newman said, "is if you're not  prudent, you won't be in business long."  </P> <P> Other firms, however, don't have as much flexibility because they are stuck  with merchandise that still needs to be sold.  </P> <P> Without approval from the factors, "you either ship at your own risk, or you  don't ship it. And if you don't ship it, you still have $300,000 of merchandise  to unload," said Eletra Casadei, owner and designer for the Casadei Group  women's wear firm.  </P> <P> "Either way, you're going to lose money on the deal."  </P> <P> Casadei said her firm so far has been able to avoid layoffs by shifting more of  its sales to specialty shops to offset the business lost with Campeau stores.  But she also is continuing to make some shipments to Campeau stores.  </P> <P> Los Angeles' biggest apparel maker, jeans maker Guess? Inc., said that about  15% of its $300 million in annual sales is with Campeau stores. For about three  months, the company has financed that business itself, without the help of a  factor.  </P> <P> But Maurice Marciano, president of Guess?, estimated that his firm would halt  about one-third of its sales to Campeau if Federated and Allied file for  Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and come under the control of a bankruptcy  judge. "I don't think you'll find one company doing business with Campeau whose  business is not affected," Marciano said.  </P> <P> For Guess?, the Campeau problems have been a "significant" setback that  ultimately could lead to the layoff of a small number of the company's roughly  1,000 employees. But things could be worse. "A lot of small firms," Marciano  said, "are not going to survive this crisis" because of their limited finances.  Small firms also are being hurt by the growing tendency of retailers to buy  from big manufacturers.  </P> <P> The future for some apparel makers could be determined at the annual market  week scheduled for the second week of January in New York, where retailers meet  with manufacturers to order new merchandise.  </P> <P> "If you're hanging on by your fingernails, you still make it to New York in  January," said Gary Freedman, a Beverly Hills lawyer who represents a number of  apparel makers.  </P> <P> "If there's going to be a big shakeout -- which people are predicting -- it'll  happen after market week," when firms return home without orders, he said.  </P></p>

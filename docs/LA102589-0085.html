			<p><P> October 25, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AT 33, IT'S STILL WORTH A SHOT;  </P> <P> PRO BASKETBALL: MARQUES JOHNSON WANTS TO FIND OUT IF HE'S STILL OF NBA CALIBER,  EVEN THOUGH HE KNOWS IT MEANS ACCEPTING A RESERVE ROLE.  </P> <P> They spoke face to face, Johnson to Johnson, last summer after another  afternoon of pickup basketball at UCLA. Marques wanted to hear it straight from  Magic, the unqualified truth:  </P> <P> "Can I still play?"  </P> <P> Marques needed to know. It had been three seasons since he had last played in  the National Basketball Assn. His once-flourishing career had ended, or so  everyone thought, 10 games into the 1986-87 season when he suffered a ruptured  cervical disk in his neck after running head-on into Clipper teammate Benoit  Benjamin's stomach.  </P> <P> Since then, Johnson had kept his distance from basketball, having received  varying reports from doctors about the degrees of danger if he were to play  with his neck condition.  </P> <P> Further, Johnson's 18-month-old son drowned shortly after that injury, and life  seemed difficult enough to handle without giving the NBA another stab. But last  summer, at 33, Johnson picked up a ball and a sense of purpose. Before he made  a move, however, he had to know whether he was fooling himself. That was when  he approached Magic.  </P> <P> The reply: "You can play. Not the way you used to play, but good enough to play  in this league."  </P> <P> Given that encouragement, Marques thought of a team that needed an older,  heavier, step-slower, 6-foot-7 swingman trying to revive his career.  </P> <P> Don Nelson, coach of the eclectic Golden State Warriors, seemed the logical  choice. Nelson had coached Johnson during his All-Star years with the Milwaukee  Bucks before Johnson was traded to the Clippers in 1984.  </P> <P> They are reunited now, and it appears that Johnson has earned the 12th, and  final, roster spot. Trying to switch to power forward on a team that can use  lineups either very tall or small, Johnson is struggling to adjust his game and  help the Warriors strictly in a supporting role.  </P> <P> If this seems quite a comedown for Johnson, a five-time All-Star and 1986  comeback player of the year who boasts a career scoring average of 20.3 points  a game, well, it is.  </P> <P> But even though he is 10 to 15 pounds heavier than during his halcyon days,  even though he has lost many of his dips and spins and other moves around the  basket, and even though he might not play much should he make the team, Johnson  wants to give it a try just to see if he still can do it.  </P> <P> Over the weekend, Johnson returned to Los Angeles with the Warriors for two  games in a four-team exhibition tournament at the Forum. He was not  particularly impressive, but he wasn't outclassed, either. He scored seven  points in 20 minutes against Cleveland Saturday and eight points in 23 minutes  against Philadelphia Sunday.  </P> <P> "He's done really well," Nelson said. "He's not there yet, but he can get  pretty close to where he was. I don't think there's anything magical about 33.  I think he can get back to the way he played when he was younger.  </P> <P> "At the start (of training camp), he was questioning himself. This isn't the  playground or UCLA in the summer against the Lakers. There are some killers in  this league who won't go easy. You won't see the change in two weeks. But in  one or two months, he'll be making those layups he's missing now."  </P> <P> Johnson, actually, seems less optimistic -- or more realistic -- than Nelson.  </P> <P> "I can't do the things I used to and I've come to terms with that," Johnson  said. "I just want to try and play again in the league.  </P> <P> "It was a struggle for me the first couple of years (after the accident). I was  uncertain whether I wanted to (play), whether I could play. It was also whether  my neck could hold up." Johnson's neck injury, which left him with temporary  paralysis, was the most serious concern. Clipper doctors recommended  corrective, albeit risky, neck surgery. Other doctors Johnson contacted,  however, determined that surgery was not required, but that playing with his  neurological condition might be risky, too.  </P> <P> "Everything is stabilized now," Johnson said. "The doctors I've seen have  assured me of that. There is no risk of paralysis. I feel confident about that.  I've been hit enough upside the head to know that I can take (the pounding).  </P> <P> "At first, I was real nervous. I didn't know whether I was going to reinjure  myself. But it got to the point where I've been hit enough that I don't even  think about it. When I play now, it's not a factor."  </P> <P> Three years of a relatively sedentary existence have created a problem, though.  </P> <P> Johnson played his first game since 1986 last July during Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's  tour of Australia with a group of former NBA players. It was not a success,  Johnson conceded. He was always winded and his skills were not sharp.  </P> <P> "That was more discouraging than encouraging," Johnson said. "That Australian  team we played against, they had been together for a long time and were in  playing shape, and we had a tough time.  </P> <P> "After that, I really questioned doing this."  </P> <P> Johnson returned to Los Angeles late last summer somewhat dejected but not  defeated. He started frequenting UCLA, where Magic Johnson, A.C. Green and  others play pickup games. Johnson said he held his own in those free-form  games, which heartened him.  </P> <P> Doubt still lingered, however. So, Marques asked Magic's advice.  </P> <P> "I just asked him point-blank, and he had a lot of positive things to say,"  Marques said. "His opinion helped, but the question is always going to be  there. I mean, it has been three years."  </P> <P> Magic said he did not want to discourage Marques but did not want to lead him  on, either.  </P> <P> "I told him what I thought, that he could still make it in this league," Magic  said. "Any time you take that much time off, you got to wonder. He kind of  caught me off guard when he asked me. I can't imagine what it is like to be a  (star) and then come back like this. But I know he is serious about it. He's  very dedicated, a true professional."  </P> <P> Marques Johnson simply hopes to be a professional again. He can accept not  being a star. He can accept sitting more than playing. He can even accept it if  Nelson cuts him. In his mind, though, he still believes he can play. Now, it is  up to his body to cooperate.  </P></p>

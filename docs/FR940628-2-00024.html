The purpose of the Notice was to request comments on environmental issues. On May 31, 1994, PGT filed an amendment to its original application. In a June 8, 1994 response to a FERC staff data request, PGT confirmed that no expansion of its mainline facilities is required to provide service to the Tuscarora Pipeline Project. From the standpoint of the environmental analysis, the important changes to the PGT Expansion II Project are:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The elimination of the additional compression originally proposed at the Sandpoint, Idaho and Rosalia, Washington Compressor Stations;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The removal from the above proceedings of three meter runs inside PGT's existing Malin Meter Station in southern Oregon; the meter runs will still be necessary to serve the Tuscarora Pipeline Project, but will now be proposed under section 157.208(a) of the Commission's regulations (18 CFR 157.208(a)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The elimination of one meter station proposed in Klamath Falls, Oregon;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The addition of two service taps on the Medford Extension Lateral;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Route realignments that increase the total miles of the Medford Extension Lateral (pipeline) to be constructed from 84.17 miles to 86.5 miles (see Table 1) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The table and appendices are not printed in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> , but have been mailed to all receiving this notice. Copies are also available from the Commission's Public Reference Branch, Room 3104, 941 North Capitol St., NE, Washington, DC 20426.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Route realignments that increase the total miles of the Coyote Springs Extension Lateral (pipeline) to be constructed from 17.71 miles to 18.5 miles (see Table 1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Prior to this amendment, the PGT Expansion II and the Tuscarora Pipeline Projects were being processed concurrently because of the inclusion in Docket No. CP93&hyph;618&hyph;000 of additional system compression and the meter runs at Malin needed to deliver gas to the Tuscarora Pipeline Project. However, the proposed amendment to eliminate the compression and the proposal to build the meter runs under separate authority make the PGT Expansion II Project a stand-alone proposal which can be considered separately from the Tuscarora Pipeline Project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the above changes, we have determined that an environmental assessment (EA), rather than an environmental impact statement, is the appropriate document for analyzing the potential environmental impacts associated with the PGT Expansion II Project. We are now preparing this document. Since the PGT facilities will be located outside the State of California, the SLC will not be a cooperating agency in the preparation of this EA. We are proceeding with a joint EIR/EIS with the SLC for the Tuscarora Pipeline Project. The three meter runs inside PGT's existing Malin Meter Station will be addressed as a related facility in that joint EIR/EIS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> The EA Process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires the Commission to take into account the environmental impacts that could result from a major Federal action whenever it considers the issuance of a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity. The EA we are preparing will give the Commission the information it needs to do that. If the EA concluded that the project would result in significant environmental impacts, the Commission would prepare an environmental impact statement. Otherwise a Finding of No Significant Impact would be produced.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NEPA also requires us to discover and address concerns the public may have about proposals. We call this ``scoping''. The main goal of the scoping process is to focus the analysis in the EA on the important environmental issues, and to separate these from issues that are insignificant and do not require detailed study. Although the scoping of the original project has already been completed, we are now asking for any additional comments only on the relocated or new portions of the project as currently proposed. Local scoping meetings have already been conducted for the original project. Additional scoping meetings are not anticipated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EA will discuss impacts that could occur as a result of the construction and operation of the proposed projects under these general subject headings:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Geology and paleontology. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Endangered and threatened species. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Visual resources. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Water resources. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Vegetation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Land use. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Air quality and noise. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Wetland and riparian habitat. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Cultural resources. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Fish and wildlife. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Socioeconomics. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Soils. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We will also evaluate possible alternatives to the project, or portions of the project, and make recommendations on how to lessen or avoid impacts on the various resource areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Our independent analysis of the issues will result in the publication of the EA which will be mailed to Federal, state, and local agencies, public interest groups, interested individuals, affected landowners, newspapers, libraries, and the Commission's official service list for these proceedings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Public Participation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> You can make a difference by sending a letter with your specific comments or concerns about the projects. You should focus on the potential environmental effects of the new portions of the proposal (see Table 1). You do not need to re-submit comments if you have already done so in this proceeding. We are particularly interested in alternatives to the proposals (including alternative routes), and measures to avoid or lessen environmental impact. The more specific your comments, the more useful they will be. Please follow the instructions below to ensure that your comments are received and properly recorded:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Address your letter to: Lois Cashell, Secretary,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 825 North Capitol St., NE.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Washington, DC 20426;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Reference Docket No. CP93&hyph;618&hyph;001;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Send a copy of your letter to:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ms. Alisa Lykens, Project Manager,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 825 North Capitol St., NE., Room 7312  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Washington, DC 20426; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Mail your comments so they will be received in Washington DC on or before July 28, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Becoming an Intervenor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition to involvement in the EA scoping process, you may want to become an official party to the proceedings or an ``intervenor''.

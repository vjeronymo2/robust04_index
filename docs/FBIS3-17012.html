			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moscow March 21 TASS -- There has been an  increasingly growing number of attempts of disinformation about  (President) Boris Yeltsin's health. Despite the press service  explanations that the president's health does not cause concern,  disinformation has been insistently repeated, a statement issued  by presidential spokesman Vyacheslav Kostikov on Monday said.    It becomes increasingly obvious that obtrusive attempts to  impose a thought upon the population that Boris Yeltsin is ill,  the desire to torpedo the president's attempts to strengthen  civic peace and accord, attempts to press for the revision of  the constitution in the part concerning the election of the  president, the increased aggressiveness of the irreconcilable  opposition and the amnesty itself -- these are the links of one  campaign. Its aim is to destabilise the situation in the  country and return to the tasks which the participants in the  October revolt failed to solve at the first attempt. It seems  like someone wants to make another one. The impression is that  the lessons of the October 1993 did not last long. Abuses of  the results of amnesty take place.    The president rejects the practice of psychological warfare  in the Russian home. He states that together with the healthy  forces of the Federation Council and the State Duma, supported  by the democratic public and somber-thinking leaders, including  leaders of the parliamentary opposition, he will continue  efforts to expand the social basis of civil peace and strengthen  Russian statehood, the statement said.</p>

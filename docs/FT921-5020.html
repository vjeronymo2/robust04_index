			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / Technology: Chip's a fast-talker There are few things more irritating than the android-like digitised voices that are used to give machine instructions. But until recently the only other way of recording and repeating a message has been the traditional audio tape. Now a digital rival has come along which enables conversation or music to be recorded in its original analogue form. The big advantage of this chip is that it gives excellent voice reproduction, says Karen Moores, product manager at Sequoia Semiconductor, the Reading-based distributor. And, say the companies that are using it, the chip, developed by Information Storage Devices, of San Jose, California, could find its way into everything from answering machines and mobile phones to talking dolls and even a talking scarecrow. London-based Voice Messaging Systems, for example, launched a package in January which has been incorporated, among other applications, in fire and security devices. Instead of just sounding an alarm, the chip can advise on the quickest route to a fire exit. Since the chip can be incorporated in packages as small as a luggage tag, it could be used to label suitcases with the traveller's name, flight number and destination, says Michael Hurlow, marketing and technical director of Voice Messaging Systems. When the next holiday comes around the traveller records over the last message by pressing a button - in the same way as recording on to a cassette. Each chip can take up to 100,000 re-recordings. Ironically, while the rest of the world is replacing analogue technology with modern digital techniques, the production of the analogue chip taxed the skills of engineers for years. Some even said it was impossible to produce. The difficult lies in storing a correct representation of the sound. With digital storage just a '0' or a '1' is required - represented by the presence or absence of an electrical pulse. ISD's chip, on the other hand, has to hold the information at varying levels between 0 and 2.5 volts. The trick, says Hurlow, is not only to store the sound but to be able to repeat it, and that involves precision in the chip's clock. 'If you get a drift in the clock you can sound very tired or very elated.' Limitations of the chip at the moment are that it can only store a maximum of 20 seconds of speech. But by the end of the year ISD will be selling a 75-second device, says Steve Stephansen, vice president of marketing and sales.</p>

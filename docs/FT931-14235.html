			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / International Company News: Mexico's revolution in retailing  -Larger store chains join forces with US groups SPEND a Saturday at Mexico City's Club Aurrera, the membership-only discount store half-owned by Wal-Mart, and you may never want to shop again. You will have to wait an hour to enter the car park, fight off customers to find a trolley, and spend another hour in the queue for a cashier. Inside will be thousands of businessmen stocking up on office supplies, merchants buying supplies for their own shops, and elegant housewives buying imported food and clothes. Company executives proudly say the Polanco Club Aurrera sells more per square metre than the most successful Sam's-Club (Club Aurrera's twin) in the US. Wal-Mart's outstanding success is the first sign of a revolution in Mexican retailing, spurred by competition in the sector, the opening of the economy to imports and the impending North American free trade agreement. Small corner stores are losing business to the supermarkets. In turn, small supermarkets are being swallowed up by a handful of large Mexican chains. And the large chains are forming alliances with the giant US retailers. Wal-Mart's partner is Cifra, Mexico's largest retailer: Price Club, the US warehouse club, has a similar venture with Comercial Mexicana, the third-largest Mexican retailer: Gigante, Mexico's second-largest retailer has formed a joint venture with Fleming, the largest US wholesaler. Not to be outdone, Liverpool, Mexico's up-market retail chain, announced in December a joint venture with K mart. They intend to invest Dollars 500m to build 100 K mart stores in Mexico. All these joint ventures have much the same purpose. As Mr Juan Carlos Mateos, planning director at Gigante, explains: 'They have the know-how and we have the know-who.' The US retailers are gaining access to an emerging, consumer-starved market of 85m people, where profit margins are around 6 per cent on sales - around double those in the US. The Mexicans, in turn, have immediate access to US technology, distribution and buying-power. The big winners are Mexican consumers, who can buy a vast array of (often imported) products at almost wholesale prices. But many, especially small, undercapitalised Mexican suppliers will suffer. The big retailers, unlike the corner stores, buy in bulk or not at all: are quick to import if quality and price are better abroad; and expect goods to be packaged to their taste, with bar codes added, and to be delivered at the time they say. Wal-Mart and Cifra have set the trend, opening their first Club Aurrera last March, with two more soon afterwards. They plan to launch another six before the end of this year. In June, Cifra and Wal-Mart extended their joint venture, and formed two jointly-owned companies. The first is administered by Cifra, and consists of new Cifra supermarkets under existing Cifra brands: the second is administered by Wal-Mart, and comprises Wal-Mart supercentres, Club Aurrera, distribution centres and an import-export company. Cifra says it will benefit from Wal-Mart's technology that should enable it to control stocks better and increase turnover. Longer term, it hopes Wal-Mart will help Cifra expand from its base in central Mexico by improving distribution channels, says a company official. Wal-Mart has 'the best distribution system in the US', says Ms Christine Aimer, an analyst at Baring Securities in Mexico City, and 'will help Cifra become a national retailer.' Gigante has already opened a non-membership 'price-impact' supermarket (called Supermart) with Fleming in the small town of San Juan del Rio, with another three expected to open by April. The company hopes to open about 10 Supermart stores a year, and to have 50 stores in operation in five years, with sales of Dollars 1bn. The company is aiming at middle-size Mexican cities, where there are fewer supermarkets and profit margins are higher. Fleming is helping Gigante scan goods as they enter and leave the shop, thus helping control stocks, and advises on the lighting and lay-out of the stores, says Mr Wayne Epperson, head of the joint-venture. But Mr Epperson is in little doubt that Fleming could not enter Mexico without help from Gigante. He, like Mr Mateos, hints one day the joint venture will be extended to include other Gigante stores. Liverpool's joint venture with K mart is perhaps the most incongruous, since Liverpool is an upmarket department store chain but will be managing K mart-style food and general goods stores. 'The joint venture,' says Mr Michel Marcos, Liverpool's director-general, of Liverpool 'will enable us to expand into different markets.' Like all US and Mexican retailers, Liverpool is betting that Mexico's economic reforms will raise the purchasing power of the middle- and lower classes, making US-style mass-market discount stores profitable. Significantly, Liverpool and Cifra are using their US alliances to promote Mexican goods in the US via jointly-owned export-import companies. Both companies know that unless Mexico's relish for consumer goods is matched by increased export revenues, the future for the retail sector is bleak.</p>

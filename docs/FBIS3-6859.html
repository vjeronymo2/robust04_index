The suspicions were directed at the United States and  despite  Washington's denials, the US was perceived as preparing to  exploit the occasion to exert pressure on various countries,  including Thailand, to open their financial services markets.    ASEAN delegates therefore resisted anything that might be  construed as commitments. APEC finance ministers' meetings  should not be "institutionalised" and the document issued at the  end of Saturday's meeting should be a "chairman's statement",  not a "joint declaration".    In the end, no binding commitments emerged but even  Malaysia's finance minister and deputy prime minister Anwar  Ibrahim was reported as saying the meeting was a success.    In several respects, the Honolulu finance ministers' meeting  was a repeat of last November's informal APEC summit in Seattle  when US President Bill Clinton (with the help of a media circles  totalling 2,000) charmed away all the doubts of ASEAN and other  Asian countries.    This time it was US Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen's turn.  Mr Clinton, in checked shirt and leather jacket, had brought  bright sunshine to a traditionally rainy Seattle autumn.  Similarly in Hawaii, Mr Bentsen, in his red-mauve shirt and  deep yellow slacks, succeeded in calming a 40 mph tempest so  that the finance ministers could play golf and speak to the  Press standing casually on a lawn with coconut trees and the  ocean as a backdrop.    Even reporters were instructed to dress casually, and their  press cards were printed in a seablue with pictures of the  Hawaiian islands and bright green coconut trees.    The result was just what the United States wanted. All APEC  ministers turned up as invited -- even the Malaysians -- and the  informality and total absence of any of the feared pressure  turned the event into a highly successful confidence-building  exercise. Mr Bentsen carefully avoided contentious issues.    As Thai finance permanent secretary Aran Thammano put it the  United States has plenty of other forums where it can be  aggressive such as meetings of the General Agreement on Tariffs  and Trade and the World Bank.    Now, however, after only one meeting of APEC finance  ministers, the group faces a problem: Where can it go from here?  It cannot continue to hold casual get-togethers at this level  showing no concrete results, without reinforcing accusations  that it is a waste of time.    But if concrete results are the objective, then controversy  may be difficult to avoid. At the same time, the coordination  of macroeconomic policy might not be a realistic objective for  so diverse a membership.    This time, the US was not alone in agreeing that the meeting  took place at all was in itself a concrete result. Mr Aran said  he found it beneficial to meet his counterparts and other  ministers from APEC countries to establish a personal  relationship as a foundation for future negotiations.    "Institutionalization" turned out to be the most  controversial word at the meeting. ASEAN was at the centre of  the discussion and even within ASEAN the cracks were scarcely  covered up.    Indonesia and Malaysia were most strongly against  "institutionalisation", which mainly meant committing APEC's  finance ministers to regular annual meetings, and generally  tightening a loose relationship.    Thailand's position was more relaxed. Finance Minister  Tharin Nimmanhemin said that institutionalisation might be  possible since the economies of APEC represent one of the most  important economic centres of the world.    He had no objection to the idea of closer cooperation on  macroeconomic policy and added that by his definition, the mere  fact that they were meeting was already a step towards  institutionalisation.    ASEAN members quickly closed ranks, fearing that if it  remained divided it would weaken its position as a major group  representing six of APEC's 17 countries.    The ASEAN position was informally defined at a dinner hosted  by Mr Tharin, representing Thailand's current chairmanship of  ASEAN. For reasons of protocol, he stressed that the gathering  was simply a "chat" and not a meeting.    Also emerging from the ASEAN dinner was the group's  opposition to a joint declaration and preference for a  non-binding chairman's statement -- again with Indonesia and  Malaysia assuming the strongest positions.    According to Thai sources, this made ASEAN appear  intransigent and unwilling to cooperate, particularly in the  eyes of Australian Treasurer Ralph Willis, who sought an  unscheduled meeting with Mr Tharin.    The result was a linguistic compromise that satisfied  ASEAN's  doubters even if most nondiplomats would have difficulty in  working out the difference -- the final document was neither a  joint declaration nor a chairman's statement but a "joint  statement".    ASEAN's linguists also succeeded in changing a reference to  "integrating" economies into "interlinking" economies.    ASEAN's concerns are not difficult to understand. When  joining a body with such large partners, smaller members are  naturally suspicious of being dominated, particularly at a time  when trade issues are becoming more contentious.    For many in Asia, the feeling remains that APEC should  remain  a consultative forum. The smaller countries believe that  anything beyond that would leave them vulnerable to pressure  from larger members.    The United States understood this and tried its best to  avoid  pressuring fellow-members. It has achieved another step in its  objective to draw closer to what it sees as an Asia Pacific  community. Washington estimates that by the year 2000, even  excluding Japan, seven million Asian households will have an  income comparable to middle-income Americans.    For the future, the question remains for APEC finance  ministers whether their meetings can achieve more substantive  results. More importantly is the question of whether APEC and  ASEAN organisations can remain unified.</p>

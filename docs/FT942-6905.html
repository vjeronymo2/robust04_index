			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / International Company News: BCI share price hit by L2,362bn issue plans Shares in Banca Commerciale Italiana, the recently-privatised Italian bank, fell by 4.4 per cent yesterday on news that the bank wants to raise up to L2,362bn (Dollars 1.5bn) through an issue of new shares and warrants. Although the proposal will not be approved by the bank's directors until June 1, the company decided to make a statement late on Wednesday because of increasing market speculation about an increase in capital. According to the statement, the board will also consider plans to seek shareholder authorisation for further capital increases of up to L2,000bn over the next five years, through the issue of bonds. BCI yesterday declined to comment on the reasons for the planned capital increases, but some of the funds could be used to help strengthen cross-shareholdings with other European banks. Earlier this week, the Italian bank announced it was negotiating to buy a 1 per cent stake in Commerzbank of Germany, which already has a stake in BCI and a seat on the board. BCI is also part of the consortium which yesterday proposed buying a large stake in Creditanstalt of Austria. Creditanstalt is represented on the board of BCI and has been a shareholder since the Italian bank's foundation last century. Yesterday, BCI shares fell from L5,341 to L5,105. If the plan is approved, BCI will issue 525m new shares on the basis of one new share for each pair already held, at a price of L3,000 a share. A further 262.5m shares will be issued for the exercise of warrants, convertible into shares at the same price. BCI was controlled by IRI, the Italian state holding company, until its privatisation in March. Since then, Mr Romano Prodi, IRI chairman, has expressed his disappointment that a few large institutions gained control of both BCI and Credito Italiano, the other newly-privatised bank.</p>

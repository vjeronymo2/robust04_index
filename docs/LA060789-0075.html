			<p><P> June 7, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> HOOVER PANEL URGES AID TO HOMELESS  </P> <P> Terming it "shameful" for such a prosperous state as California to allow up to  250,000 homeless people to live on the streets, the Little Hoover Commission on  Tuesday called for more aggressive leadership, improved program coordination  and less red tape for homeless aid applicants.  </P> <P> Noting that more than $780 million from a variety of sources is spent annually  on homeless aid services, the watchdog state government commission said it  found existing programs to be fragmented and poorly coordinated.  </P> <P> "The homeless are not a hidden or ignored problem in this state," Commission  Chairman Nathan Shapell said in releasing the findings of a two-year study.  "Yet the state's streets, parking lots, greenbelts, alleys and stairwells still  are hosts to thousands of homeless families and children nightly."  </P> <P> Two key recommendations contained in a 13-point program were proposals to  consolidate all programs for the homeless under the state Health and Welfare  Agency and to establish centralized "one-stop" county reception centers for  homeless aid applicants.  </P> <P> The report of the blue-ribbon commission said the one-stop reception centers  would sign up all newly homeless individuals, assess their needs and hook them  into all applicable aid programs.  </P> <P> Maggie DeBow, a spokeswoman for the State Health and Welfare Agency, said the  agency "would be willing to consider any and all proposals that the commission  has to offer to help reduce the homeless problem in California."  </P></p>

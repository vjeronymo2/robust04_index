			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Liu Xiaoqing [0491 1420 7230]] </F>   [Text] Chongqing, 29 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--With the  efforts made in the past dozen of years, the war industry in  southwest China has basically shifted production to turning out  civilian products. Last year, the output value of civilian  products turned out by the war industry in the southwest reached  over 8 billion yuan, accounting for more than 90 percent of the  total output value of the industry.    The war industry in the southwest is an important part of  the  war industry in China. The industry consists of over 50  enterprises, research institutes, institutions of higher  learning, and schools. It employs 250,000 staff members and  workers and has fixed assets amounting to over 4 billion yuan.  In the 1950's and 1960's, the war industry of the southwest  mainly produced military products and occupied a decisive  position in the war industry of China.    The war industry of the southwest began its strategic shift  to the production of civilian products at the beginning of the  1980's. This production has been expanding year after year and  at present, its scale is considerable. It now turns out more  than 10 categories of major products including mini-cars,  motorcycles, heavy-duty trucks, machines for oil production,  optical and electrical instruments, refrigerators, and cameras.  It has formed a production set up in which the production of  cars occupies a dominant position. By the end of 1993, the  southwest war industry had produced an accumulated total of over  5 million motorcycles, over 140,000 mini- cars, 800,000 cameras,  and nearly 500,000 refrigerators. Ninety percent of its  enterprises have their own leading civilian products.    Since it began its shift to the production of civilian  products, the southwest war industry has established ties of  cooperation with over 500 civilian product enterprises and over  300 rural enterprises in China. It has also strengthened its  cooperation with foreign countries and has imported a lot of  advanced technology and equipment from abroad. More than 20 of  its major projects have advanced technology and production lines  imported from foreign countries for turning out civilian  products. To date, the southwest war industry has over 50  Sino-foreign joint ventures for turning out civilian products  and agreements signed by these joint ventures involve investment  amounting to a total of over $1.5 billion. The export of  civilian products by the southwest war industry has exceeded 1  billion yuan.    It is learned from the Southwest Company that by the end of  the Eighth Five-Year Plan, both the output value and sales  volume of civilian products turned out by the southwest war  industry will reach 10 billion yuan. The company will use  various channels to introduce foreign capital to develop the  production of civilian products and is ready to make investments  and set up factories abroad.</p>

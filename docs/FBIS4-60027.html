			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Qusayy Salih Darwish: "Appointments in Algerian </F> Army To Strengthen Pro-Dialogue Trend"]    [Excerpts] President Liamine Zeroual has continued his  series of changes within the Algerian Army. He has appointed  Brigadier General Tayeb Darragi and Brigadier General Taghit as  advisers at the Defense Ministry. The two were previously Army  inspector generals. He also appointed Atiqi Lakhdar as chief of  staff of the National Gendarmerie, replacing Brigadier General  Ahmed Boustila, who was summoned for other duties. These  appointments show that President Zeroual continues to appoint  officers close to him to sensitive posts and to keep away  officers opposed to his political line by giving them  administrative posts as in the case of Brig. Gen. Taghit who is  considered to be close to the trend opposed to dialogue.  Furthermore, the removal of Boustila from the gendarmerie  command will completely destroy what is left of the influence of  Brigadier General Abbas Ghzayl who kept his post as Gendarmerie  Commander at the last moment, after a decision had been made to  dismiss him. Abbas Ghzayl's health is deteriorating and that  will enable Atiqi Lakhdar to become the real commander of the  National Gendarmerie which is very important to the regime as  far as security is concerned. [passage omitted]    Meanwhile, informed sources speak of sharp differences  between the [Islamic] Salvation Front [FIS] and the Armed  Islamic Groups [GIA] following the assassination of the French  priest and nun which was condemned by FIS and for which the GIA  claimed responsibility. According to the same sources, the  dialogue between the two stopped some time ago after the more  extremist "Afghan" group assumed control within the GIA. As  regards the dialouge with the authorities, FIS sources emphasize  that Cheiks Ali Djeddi and Abdelqadir Boukhamkham were not  allowed to visit Abbasi Madani and Ali Belhadj for consultation  as agreed when they were released. As a result, contacts  between the FIS leaders and the regime's officials were frozen.  [passage omitted]</p>

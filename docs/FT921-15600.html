			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / Bank poised to step in as sterling slides THE BANK of England went on alert last night after sterling ended the day within a whisker of its lowest permitted point in the European exchange rate mechanism and at its weakest close against the D-Mark since the UK entered the ERM 15 months ago. Should the pound continue to fall and intervention by the Bank fail to stop the slide, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, faces the politically damaging option of having to raise interest rates to increase sterling's value. Such a move would threaten the fragile UK recovery, and lead to more calls from Conservative backbenchers and anti-ERM economists for a sterling devaluation - an option which the government has ruled out. After a nervous day on currency and equity markets, sterling closed in London down a pfennig at DM2.8350, within roughly a quarter of a pfennig of its effective ERM floor of about DM2.8325. In late New York trading it fluctuated around the same level, at one point falling to DM2.832. Sterling's weakness was caused largely by a stronger D-Mark and lack of support from investors worried by signs of a long and slow recovery from the UK recession. On the London stock market, share prices suffered from concern about the world economy and reports of President Bush's collapse. However, the FT-SE 100 index of leading shares recovered from a 41-point loss to close at 2,467.0, down 15.9. The mood on markets was one of edgy calm. 'There is a marked absence of good news,' said Mr Mark Brett, currency analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, a London investment bank. Assuming sterling opens today weaker, Mr Lamont is thought likely to instruct the Bank to buy sterling on foreign exchange markets, rather than risk the much more unpalatable option of increasing interest rates from their current 10.5 per cent. If the pound hits its ERM floor, intervention by the Bank would probably be aided by similar moves by other European central banks to push up sterling's value. Also, since the pound's lower effective limit in the ERM is set by the peseta, the strongest currency in the system, the Bank of Spain would be called on to sell the Spanish currency, cutting its value and reducing the pressure on the UK unit. Should large-scale intervention be required, however, a question mark hangs over the readiness of the other ERM members to lend wholehearted support. Since the Bundesbank increased German interest rates just before Christmas, all the other countries, except Britain, have increased borrowing rates because of the strains in the mechanism. These nations might argue that the UK should do likewise, as part of the learning process associated with joining the ERM.

			<p><P> January 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Christmas decorations still glow nightly in downtown Delano. It's not that  residents remain captivated by the holiday; it's just that the Chamber of  Commerce does not have the money to store the decorations and pay for insurance  coverage. Because of the lack of funds, the chamber's board voted against  renewing a contract to have a Fresno-area firm store the green and red  decorations. They have been plugged into city light poles since mid-November,  and the lights turn on automatically every evening.  </P></p>

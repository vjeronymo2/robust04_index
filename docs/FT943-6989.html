			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Zinc smelters face feed shortage Zinc smelters face major uncertainty in the next 10 years in securing concentrate feed supplies due to an unprecedented number of mine closures, according to metals industry analysts Brook Hunt and Associates, reports Reuters. In its latest review of the zinc concentrates market, Brook Hunt said that a squeeze on miners' profits by low metal prices and high treatment charges had resulted in 17 mines, with a total capacity of about 500,000 tonnes of zinc in concentrate, closing in 1993. And it forecast the closure before 2005, because of reserve depletion, of another 58 mines with an annual capacity of some 1.9m tonnes. The magnitude of the mine closures meant that only 18 out of 54 primary zinc smelters had adequate feed cover to 2005 from mines now in operation, the report said. Brook Hunt suggested that the industry needed an additional 1.3m tonnes a year of contained zinc from new mine production to meet the feed requirements of existing smelters in 2005. It also needed a similar tonnage for the 1.2m tonnes of new smelter capacity required to satisfy a forecast market demand of more than 6.5m tonnes of refined zinc. New mine projects, re-activations and expansions might add 2.5m tonnes, Brook Hunt said, but start-up dates would be influenced by ruling metal prices. Over-production at western smelters since 1990 was forecast to push total stocks to 1.8m tonnes by the end of this year, fuelling an extended period of low zinc prices. That could accelerate mine closures and delay the start-up of new mine capacity. Lower mine supplies would also prompt fierce competition in a custom concentrate market enlarged by additional smelters in Brazil and Thailand because of the depletion of ores at local mines. Smelters in Canada, Australia and Mexico would lose feed from existing mines in the next five years which, directly or indirectly, would reduce availability to the custom market.</p>

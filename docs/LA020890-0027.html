			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHALL WE CLONE THE GLOBE, AMERICAN-STYLE?;  </P> <P> DEFENSE: BY CUTTING OUR ARMED STRENGTH SLOWLY, CAUTIOUSLY, WE CAN BE WHAT WE  WANT TO BE -- NO. 1 MILITARILY AND IN EVERYTHING ELSE.  </P> <P> Because Americans want America to be No. 1, we won't -- and we shouldn't --  make big, quick cuts in the defense budget.  </P> <P> From 1945 to the mid-'60s, our leaders told us that we were the most powerful  military force -- first in the world -- and we loved to hear it. Then, Soviet  military power grew and politicians began saying America was "second to none."  By 1980, hard-liners were saying what we did not like to hear -- that we were  "second," or "unless we rebuilt militarily, we would become second." Hmm.  First. Second to none. Second.  </P> <P> In the 1980s, America rebuilt. Partly as a result, some argue, the Soviets  began self-destructing.  </P> <P> Now we must decide what to do about defense. The doves have an answer: Cut it  back and reap a big peace dividend. At last, the dove case makes some sense. It  is, after all, rooted in the ancient hawk precept: "The American military  budget is set in the Kremlin." With the Soviets weaker, say the doves, we can  cut big and fast.  </P> <P> Why not? How could a hawk oppose such logic? There are some rational reasons.  And there is another reason that is mystical, yet known to almost all.  </P> <P> Rational reasons: Big Soviet defense cuts haven't happened yet. It's hard to  cut budgets quickly -- contracts have been let. Research and development take a  long time. We have other military responsibilities.  </P> <P> Then there is that other reason: If we play our cards right, we will be able to  wave our forefinger, as Americans do when their team wins a football game, and  yell: "We're No. 1 militarily!" Partly because of that, we'll probably be first  in everything else, too.  </P> <P> But is it good to be No. 1? It costs money, and it can periodically get you  into trouble.  </P> <P> On balance, it's fine. Throughout history, nations that had a chance at it,  tried for it. When you're No. 1, other folks don't usually mess with you in a  serious way.  </P> <P> Since Colonial times, Americans have wanted to be first. John Winthrop said  America would be "a city upon a hill . . . the eyes of all people are upon us."  Later, Andrew Jackson said America is "a country manifestly called by the  Almighty to a destiny." It soon got a little out of hand. James Gordon Bennett  wrote that "it is our manifest destiny to lead and rule all other nations."  President William McKinley used "manifest destiny" to justify annexing Hawaii.  President Ronald Reagan quoted Winthrop.  </P> <P> What do you do with it, if you're No. 1? Invade the world? Clone the globe,  American-style?  </P> <P> Of course not. If you have to ask the question, you don't understand it. But,  if we're lucky, we'll find out what being No. 1. The Judeo-Christian God,  remember, is a God that reveals himself as history unfolds. That's one reason  the West has always been oriented to the future.  </P> <P> Ask 100 Americans whether they want to be No. 1, and 90 will say yes. Why?  Because we peddle the American idea. Americans today want to offer the world a  kinder, gentler, optional manifest destiny. When you're No. 1, people pay more  attention.  </P> <P> We have an opportunity now to be first -- and on the cheap. (Just when they  were saying America was in decline!) The Soviet empire is unilaterally engaged  in a going-out-of-business sale. So we can all agree to cut back our military.  But by how much? How fast? We can do it in a spasm, increasing chances that  there will be a world with no leader. Or, by cutting our military only slowly  and cautiously, we can make it more likely that we will be what we want to be  -- No. 1.  </P></p>

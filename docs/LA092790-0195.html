			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: EL TORO;  </P> <P> CEREMONY FOR OLD, NEW COMMANDERS  </P> <P> Change-of-command ceremonies are scheduled for 3 p.m. Friday as Brig. Gen.  David V. Shuter, the commanding officer of the Marine Corps Air Station in El  Toro, retires and is replaced by Brig. Gen. Wayne T. Adams.  </P> <P> The outdoor ceremonies, with band music and troops in formation, repeat one of  the oldest military traditions: saying goodby to the old commander and  welcoming the new.  </P> <P> Shuter, 53, has been commanding general of the air base at El Toro since Oct.  6, 1987. He is completing 36 years of military service, and he and his wife  will retire in the Orange County area, military officials said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Adams, 50, was promoted to brigadier general -- one star -- on April 28, 1989.  He previously directed a division of the Marine Corps' Installations and  Logistics Department in Washington.  </P> <P> Adams is a native of southern Florida and received a bachelor's degree in  political science and economics from the University of Alabama. His 29-year  military record includes two tours of duty in South Vietnam during the war. He  has accumulated more than 3,600 flight hours piloting fixed-wing and helicopter  aircraft.  </P> <P> Adams and his wife have three children: Jeff, a Los Angeles County sheriff's  deputy; Allison, a flight attendant, and Rob, a college student.  </P></p>

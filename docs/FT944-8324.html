			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Call to put nuclear waste on tips The government should force local authorities to accept low-level radioactive waste on council rubbish tips, says an influential advisory body. The Radioactive Waste Management Advisory Committee says in a submission to the government's review of radioactive waste that it is highly unsatisfactory that waste producers are forced to use Drigg, a repository at Sellafield in Cumbria, because they are being turned away by councils. The committee says that Drigg is a national asset. Some of its capacity is being filled by material that is 'suitable to go elsewhere'. Greenpeace, the environmental pressure group which published extracts of the committee's submission yesterday, said it was unacceptable that an unelected body wanted to ignore the safety fears of elected councils. Ms Bridget Woodman of Greenpeace said: 'Even the smallest doses of radiation can be fatal. Low-level nuclear waste can remain radioactive for thousands of years, posing a threat to both ourselves and future generations.' Under the 1990 Environmental Protection Act local authorities must be 'persuaded' rather than directed to make landfill sites available for low-level radioactive waste. This reversed previous legislation which gave the government enforcement powers. The committee says there is little incentive for local authorities to be persuaded to take radioactive waste because of opposition from pressure groups and public fears. The committee says: 'It is obviously unsatisfactory from the waste producer's point of view to be pressurised to use Drigg, and therefore incur higher costs, because suitable landfill facilities are not available locally. 'The government need to ensure . . . landfill sites are available for appropriate low-level waste.' It adds that the government should adopt powers to enable it to direct councils and private landfill operators to accept 'appropriate' low-level radioactive waste on refuse tips and landfill sites. The Department of the Environment said the committee's submission was one of many which would be considered.</p>

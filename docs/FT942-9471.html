			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / Waves of concern spread through City over Crest: Norma Cohen on the Bank's proposal for paperless share settlements The Bank of England is in a tetchy mood over its proposed Crest system for paperless share settlements. Last week, executive director Mr Pen Kent lambasted the press for suggesting that the project 'will be late, over budget, disappointingly undersubscribed and insensitive to small investors'. So the Bank, which has generally received high marks from the City for its efforts to build Crest, is unlikely to be pleased about the criticisms contained in a prestigious legal journal which suggests that the project actually increases risks in the securities industry rather than helping to reduce them. Most significant among these risks, the article says, are those which will be created because Crest uses 'real time gross settlement' rather than the net settlement system currently in use. While gross settlement of equity bargains tallies up payments for each transaction separately, net settlement adds up all the bargains between two counterparties and calculates the 'net' payment, or balance, which one must make to the other. Bankers who have been very supportive of the Crest project say they share this concern. They have held meetings with the Bank of England and with their largest customers to discuss how much additional credit they will need to ext-end as the Crest project progresses. 'We are hearing estimates of marketmakers needing Pounds 20m, Pounds 30m, Pounds 40m,' said one banker involved in the talks. Net payments are a fraction of the value of all deals, and thus reduce the need for borrowing by participants in the market. This has particular implications for marketmakers - securities firms which are required to buy and sell equities at firm prices in all market conditions. Many of their bargains are among themselves and they have benefited from net settlement. In an article in the May 1994 edition of Butterworths Journal of International Banking and Financial Law, Ms Kathleen Tyson-Quah, a former Securities and Investments Board executive, wrote: 'Given the cost-effectiveness and capital efficiency of net payments it is likely to put market-makers in particular out of business.' The Bank has told bankers that 'risks must be recognised and they must be paid for'. 'Initially I don't think the Crest taskforce has considered the implications for the securities industry,' one banker said. A portion of the demand for increased credit also comes from the move to 10-day rolling settlement on July 18. This abandons the two or three-week account settlement period which had allowed for net settlement of trades on a single day. From July there will still be net settlement but only of a single day's trades at a time. The Bank is drawing up a matrix to help banks gauge how much extra credit their securities-house clients are likely to need. Gross settlement in the Crest system is expected to cause particular pain for marketmakers when, as many bankers expect, the Bank of England follows the US Federal Reserve Bank and begins charging interest on so-called intra-day borrowings from its own reserves. These are funds borrowed in the morning and fully repaid by the close of business. Gross settlement is likely to cause marketmakers to borrow heavily at various points during each day. 'If they go overdrawn we will have to charge them,' one banker said. The point is an obscure one which has eluded most of the City up until now. Bankers are also worried about the role they have been accorded in the design of Crest. Privately, the British Bankers' Association has expressed its concerns to the Bank. First, bankers are worried that they will in effect be the final arbiters of which securities firms are allowed to participate in Crest. Denial of credit facilities to securities firms or higher credit cost to customers will spark accusations that banks are driving firms out of the business, bankers fear. 'The banks are afraid they will be cast as the villains of the piece,' said one BBA official, adding that the Bank of England's response had been that 'it will be a public relations exercise'.</p>

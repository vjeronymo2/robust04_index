			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: BIG EAST CONFERENCE ADDS MIAMI  </P> <P> The University of Miami, a football power trying to improve its basketball  image, joined the Big East Conference on Wednesday and the conference  commissioner says that probably saved the league.  </P> <P> "To be very blunt with you, our future was at stake," Commissioner Mike  Tranghese said.  </P> <P> "If the Big East and the University of Miami could not have gotten together,  I'm not certain we had an answer that would have satisfied the football  concerns of Pitt, Boston College and Syracuse."  </P> <P> There was fear that those schools would have joined Miami and others with  Division I-A football programs to form an Eastern Seaboard conference.  </P> <P> Miami will become the 10th Big East member beginning with the 1991-92 seasons  in most sports.  </P> <P> Miami football will stay on its own until it can work out a commitment with the  three other Big East Division I-A members because the Big East does not compete  as a conference in football.  </P></p>

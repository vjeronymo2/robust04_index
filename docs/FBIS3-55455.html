Touching on the defeat of the  democratic forces in the parliamentary elections on December 12  Kostikov says, "one of the root causes of the failure of the  democrats in the elections is that neither their parties nor  their leaders have a taste or skills for conducting routine work  for the sake of true values for the state and the people." The  aim of the electoral campaign was not to promote ideas capable  of normalising Russia but "winning a deputy mandate and reaping  the interest on the success. The programme of none of the  electoral coalitions contained even a hint at the ways in which  national and not inner party or group problems will be tackled".    Explaining why the country needs a trial of the August 1991  coup plotters and of the totalitarian ideology as a whole  Kostikov writes: "Millions of people who suffered enough from  the omnipotence of the communist party of the Soviet Union will  only believe that the suppressed rebellion (in October 1993)  liberated us from the threat of communist restoration if the  admirers of the red-and-brown sauce, sickles, hammers and  swastikas have a firm and clear indication of their place in  society".    ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI lead with a report about the opening of  the  Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation on Tuesday. "This day  will open a new political year. Because everything that happened  between the elections and this day is no more than an  anticipation, a presentiment and guesswork".    Explaining why the bulk of the voters cast their ballots in  favour of the opposition electoral coalitions, the newspaper  notes that most people "voted for those who was active. There is  nothing can be done because we still believe in the strength of  speeches, convincingly sounding pronouncements and propaganda  push." Along with this, the newspaper writes, it would be  erroneous to think that the considerable number of voters who  favoured the communists, the agrarians close to the former and  especially the liberal democrats personifies radical left or  right wing public sentiments, although such sentiments  undoubtedly exist.    ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI see as a good sign the fact that even the  oppositional coalition leaders seek to convince the public that  they "are going to the parliament not to make war but to work  constructively". The confrontational political style, or at  least its rhetoric, is no longer in fashion, the newspaper  concludes. KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (Red Star) writes that there are more  questions than answers on the eve of the opening of the Federal  Assembly. The newspaper adds that only one parliament group --  that of the deputies from the communist party of the Russian  Federation -- gathered in the parliamentary centre on January 9.    The same newspaper comments on the presidential decree  (dated  December 22, 1993), which endorsed the regulation for the  federal civil service. It says this system of state power has  existed in Russia for centuries but was forgotten in recent  years. Civil servants of all ranks are known to present-day  Russians from historical tales and fiction.</p>

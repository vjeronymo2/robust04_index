			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Stocks climb relieved by economic data Wall Street US stocks moved higher yesterday, with investors consoled that a crucial measure of economic strength came in below expectations, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 21.87 better at 3,797.43, and the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was up 2.74 at 455.10. The American SE composite added 1.52 at 455.12 while the Nasdaq composite outperformed the lot with a gain of 5.77 to 749.96. On the NYSE, advancing issues outnumbered declines by a four-to-three margin on moderate volume of 284m shares. Amid a week of fretting in the financial markets, the Labor Department disclosed that fewer workers had been hired in September than most economists had forecast. Non-farm payrolls grew by 239,000, against a consensus estimate of about 260,000. Even though the August increase in payrolls was revised sharply higher, the tame headline figure allowed bond prices to stabilise and push higher late in the day. The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury issue receded after touching the worrisome 8.00 per cent level just before the release of the jobs data. But the relief was qualified, at best. The news seemed likely to avert an immediate move by the Federal Reserve to put up interest rates, but a tightening did not appear to be too far in future. Stocks opened with decent gains, but second guessing among investors quickly pulled the leading indices into negative territory. Towards midday, share prices followed bonds higher again, powered by across-the-board gains in oil-related issues. The sector's improvement had nothing to do with the economy or monetary policy. With reports of Iraqi troop movements near the Kuwait border and a subsequent upturn in crude prices, Exxon gained Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 58 1/4 , Texaco Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 61 1/8 and Chevron Dollars 1 to Dollars 48 5/8 . IBM, the NYSE's most active issue, also contributed to the Dow's advance. The stock jumped Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 71 1/4 on reports that the computer maker had sold out its new Aptiva line through the end of the year. On the Nasdaq, Broderbund Software surged Dollars 5 1/8 to Dollars 57 1/2 . Oppenheimer lifted its rating on the issue after the company posted a 51 per cent increase in earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter. Biogen was marked up Dollars 5 1/2 or 11 per cent to Dollars 54 3/4 . The big gain followed news that Schering and Rentschler, two German pharmaceuticals houses, had agreed to develop and market Beta-interferon jointly. The deal was viewed by Wall Street as beneficial to Biogen, which is developing a different form of the drug to treat multiple sclerosis.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, May 21 (CTK) -- The opposition Movement  for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) intends to lodge a complaint  with parliament, the Council of Europe and foreign human rights  organizations, concerning of the rejection of a petition drive  launched by the HZDS earlier this year and aimed at organizing  the first referendum in the country. This follows from a  session of the HZDS National Board held in Nimnica u Puchova,  west Slovakia, today.    The petition drive for the referendum, through which the  HZDS  wanted to solve the questions of the early elections, the  withdrawal of mandates from "disobedient deputies," and the  "purity" of money involved in privatization, was rejected in  mid-March by the Presidential Office, which argued that the  constitutional condition of gaining at least 350,000 petition  signatures which enable the president to launch the referendum,  had not been met. Signatures started to be collected in late  February, and on March 2 the petition committee handed to the  Presidential Office lists with 422,054 signatures. However,  after their verification only 232,957 were recognized as valid.    HZDS representatives said today that the party experts had  re- examined the lists and stated that more that 372,000  signatures were valid, it means more than required by the  Constitution. HZDS Chairman Vladimir Meciar insisted that his  former collaborator and current adversary, President Michal  Kovac, had breached his constitutional duty to call the  referendum.    Referring to the HZDS pre-election strategy, Meciar said it  was correct for its former partner in the government coalition,  the Slovak National Party (SNS), to enter the autumn  parliamentary elections separately. Nevertheless, the HZDS  counts on post-election cooperation with the SNS, he added.    Polls show that the HZDS and the SNS could gain more votes  if  entering the elections separately. But while the HZDS's  popularity among Slovak citizens is 27-32 per cent, the SNS has  less than five per cent of followers.</p>

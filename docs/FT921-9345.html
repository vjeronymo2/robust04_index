			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Case against the jury: Lord Roskill tells Robert Rice that fraud trials need rethinking Thanking the jury at the end of the seven-month Barlow Clowes investment fraud trial on Monday, Mr Justice Phillips, the trial judge, said: 'Until recent times, no one could have imagined that our legal system could place such a burden on anyone's time.' In the light of the abandonment last Friday of the third part of the lengthy and complex prosecution arising out of the 1986 Guinness takeover of Distillers, and the collapse yesterday of the second Guinness trial, his comments will refuel the debate about whether long and complex fraud cases are suitable for trial by jury. Yesterday Lord Roskill, the former Law Lord who chaired the three-year inquiry into the conduct of fraud cases which reported in 1986, added his voice to growing concern over the issue by calling on the government to rethink its decision to ignore his advice that complex fraud cases were unsuitable for trial by jury. 'I'm impenitent about non-jury trials for complex frauds. This view was right in 1986 and nothing has happened to change my mind.' This issue was central to the Fraud Trials Committee inquiry. The committee concluded, with one dissenting opinion, that complex frauds should be heard by a Fraud Trials Tribunal comprising a judge and two lay members with experience of business and finance. Most of the Roskill recommendations, including the establishment of the Serious Fraud Office and the introduction of special pre-trial procedures for prosecuting fraud, were adopted by the government in the 1987 Criminal Justice Act. The government, however, rejected a special Fraud Trials Tribunal. The committee's view was that many jurors were out of their depth in complex fraud cases and that society appeared to have an attachment to jury trial which was 'emotional or sentimental rather than logical'. Lord Roskill said in his report that the material he had encountered in commercial fraud cases had been uniquely complex. Yesterday, he accepted that the difficulties facing the juries in the recent cases were mainly the result of the volume of material. The issue of whether 12 ordinary men and women could understand complex fraud cases or needed to sit through trials of this length remains unresolved, he added. A further problem thrown up by the recent trials was their length. Not enough use was being made of pre-trial hearings to whittle cases down to manageable proportions before trial, Lord Roskill said. The Fraud Trials Committee had recommended that a trial judge should be nominated at the initial stage of a proposed prosecution and given the power to discharge the defendant at a preparatory hearing or to reduce the charges on the ground that the prosecution evidence was insufficient. Effective pre-trial reviews were a vital ingredient of the successful prosecution of fraud, the committee said. The system would only work if trial judges subjected the prosecution case to close scrutiny in pre-trial hearings, the former Law Lord said yesterday. 'The whole object was to cut down the length of the eventual trial.' The correct use of the pre-trial procedure in the Guinness prosecution had reduced the length of the first Guinness trial by an estimated 25 per cent, he said. Even then it had still lasted more than six months. In the Blue Arrow trial, which started on February 11 last year, a great deal of time had been spent arguing points in the absence of the jury (which was out of court for roughly 30 per cent of the total length of the trial). This suggested that the pre-trial procedures had not been properly used, Lord Roskill said. 'A very firm line must be taken at preliminary hearings so that the issues have been streamlined by the time the case gets to trial,' he added. Lord Roskill's views are still not accepted by the one dissenting member of his committee. Mr Walter Merricks, a solicitor and assistant secretary-general of the Law Society, said he had not changed his mind over the need to maintain trial by jury in complex fraud cases. He said there was an essential unfairness in distinguishing between murderers, drug traffickers, burglars and rapists on the one hand and financial fraudsters on the other. 'Why should the man who stole Pounds 1m from a bank using a shotgun be allowed the right to trial by jury, while the man who used a computer is denied the same right?' he asked in the report. A jury would almost always be more favourable to a defendant than a tribunal, Mr Merricks wrote. When a defendant was convicted, he would not say the jury was biased. But a tribunal of professionals could be accused of bias. If they acquitted a defendant, the public might say they were helping out their City friends. The presence of a jury also ensured that the case had to be comprehensible to the press and the average member of the public. The fundamental issue in fraud cases was dishonesty, and it was dangerous to entrust the judgment of this to experts, Mr Merricks wrote in the report. 'I still think it is wrong to single out one type of criminal trial and say 'somehow these cases are special',' he said yesterday. 'In my view you would never be able to define properly what makes a case so complex that it has to be heard by a special tribunal. You would end up spending more time in pre-trial hearings arguing whether it was a special case or not and appealing it than you would if you just got on and put it before a jury.' Lord Roskill's call for a reconsideration of the question of a special tribunal is likely to increase pressure on the government to act. With further cases pending - alleged frauds concerning the Bank of Credit and Commerce International and the Polly Peck fruit and electronics group, and potential charges from the collapse of the Maxwell empire - the government can no longer afford to ignore growing public concern that the UK seems to have difficulty in successfully prosecuting the perpetrators of financial misdeeds.</p>

			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report LME TIN prices closed near 25-month highs. Three-month tin's early test of support at Dollars 6,600 a tonne encouraged buying in the afternoon and the market quickly made headway to within a whisker of the Dollars 6,700 level. Dips continue to attract buying interest and sentiment is also aided by forward technical tightness. ZINC was again buffeted by waves of liquidation, three-month metal dropping below support at Dollars 1,210 a tonne at one stage to touch a 3 1/2 -month low of Dollars 1,206. The squeeze continued to unravel, exerting pressure, traders said. Traders were expecting LME warehouse stocks to rise again today. Comex COPPER remained lower at midsession on the heels of Chinese selling and falling equities markets. 'The Chinese selling was enough to cap the market,' said one New York analyst. Floor sources said many players took profits from Wednesday's rise to lifetime highs across the board. The slippage in the Japanese and US stock markets weighed on sentiment by pointing to lessening demand. New York raw SUGAR prices were lower at midday as profit taking emerged after Wednesday's advance above 11 cents a lb for the July contract. Compiled from Reuters</p>

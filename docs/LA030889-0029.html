			<p><P> March 8, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SOUTH COUNTY;  </P> <P> SADDLEBACK BOARD DELAYS BUS CUTBACKS  </P> <P> Parents worried about their children's safety persuaded the Saddleback Unified  School District board Tuesday night to postpone any cutbacks in free bus  transportation until at least the fall.  </P> <P> However, the board voted to reconsider the same plan, at a meeting April 4, for  the school year beginning in September.  </P> <P> Board members also said Tuesday that reducing the bus service now would  interrupt students' schedules and would cause confusion.  </P> <P> For 5 years, the district had charged $135 per student for bus service to and  from school. But last December the state barred school districts from charging  fees for bus service, following an appellate court ruling that those fees were  unconstitutional.  </P> <P> Currently, the district pays for bus transportation for students in  kindergarten through sixth grade who live at least three-fourths of a mile from  school, for seventh- and eighth-graders who live at least a mile away, and for  older students who live 2 or more miles away.  </P> <P> The plan shelved by unanimous vote Tuesday would have increased the minimum  distances for all age groups.  </P> <P> Some parents from the Portola Hills area who have teen-agers attending El Toro  High School on Toledo Way in El Toro said they were worried about their  children walking 3.5 miles along El Toro Road to get to school.  </P> <P> "He might as well walk on the San Diego or the Santa Ana freeway because they  go 65 m.p.h. there too," parent Suzanne Childress said before the meeting.  </P></p>

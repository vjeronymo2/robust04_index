			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The French soldiers yesterday pushed their  patrols forward as far as 20 km from battlefields in Gikongoro  Prefecture. According to Captain Emmanuel Ndahiro of the Rwandan  Patriotic Army [RPA], French soldiers found to be standing in  RPA's way will be asked to account for it.    Although Paris describes the present mission as a  humanitarian one, nobody is fooled by the real intentions of its  intervention which is to protect criminals. Moreover, these  criminals have started (?rejoicing). Prime Minister Kambanda,  the so-called prime minister, for example, announced clearly the  day before the French troops landed in Goma and Bukavu in  eastern Zaire, that his men had received new consignments of  arms which would enable them to celebrate the 32nd independence  anniversary in Kigali on 1 July.

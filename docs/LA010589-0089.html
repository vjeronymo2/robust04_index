			<p><P> January 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A STREET CRUISER TURNS COURT BRUISER;  </P> <P> SKATEBOARDER FINDS BASKETBALL BEARINGS  </P> <P> Paul Matijasevic didn't fit the bill as a skate rat.  </P> <P> At 6 feet, 5 inches, Matijasevic towered over his boarding buddies. His  skateboard resembled an emery board under his size-15 sneakers. He didn't even  like the pounding, discordant strains of the "thrash rock" that pulsed from his  friends' oversized boom boxes.  </P> <P> Still, one glance at Matijasevic's freshman report card at Crescenta Valley  High proved that he was spending far more time cruising the La Crescenta  pavement than pounding the books.  </P> <P> "After school I would just take the board and go," said Matijasevic, who posted  a 1.0 grade-point average his first semester. "My parents would ground me and  take my board away but I would end up buying a new one. It was a big quarrel."  </P> <P> Matijasevic's favorite game was to lie supine on his board and barrel down a  steep street in a position aptly dubbed "the coffin." Two years ago, he says, a  friend followed in a car and proudly informed him that the 6-5 inch missile was  traveling at 50 m.p.h.  </P> <P> One neighbor, John Goffredo, saw more than a gangly, apathetic kid in  Matijasevic. Goffredo, boys' basketball coach at Crescenta Valley, saw a  project.  </P> <P> Today, Matijasevic is 2 inches taller and his grade-point average is 2 full  points higher. The junior laughs about the times when his distaste for school  was rivaled only by his disdain for a haircut.  </P> <P> And although Matijasevic's skills on the hardwood are not as practiced as his  moves on a plywood skateboard, he has earned a position as a starting forward  for the Falcon varsity. He averages 11 points and 10 rebounds a game and  recently was named to the all-tournament team at the Eldorado tournament.  </P> <P> Basketball, however, was not an instant panacea for Matijasevic. In fact, he  almost quit his freshman season.  </P> <P> "He didn't care for the discipline," Goffredo said. "Now he realizes the end  product. Nobody likes to be yelled at, chewed on or pushed, but he  understands."  </P> <P> Matijasevic, who stood 6-4 as a seventh-grader, was lumbering up a hill --  skateboard in hand -- when he had his first encounter with Goffredo. The coach  asked him if he spent much time on the court, or was planning to do so. In an  attempt to stave off Goffredo's interest, Matijasevic said that he planned to  attend St. Francis High and did not intend to play basketball.  </P> <P> The coach did not push the issue.  </P> <P> "I knew I had to hook him first," he said. "I had to get him to like the  sport."  </P> <P> Matijasevic said that he enrolled at Crescenta Valley because his grades were  too low for St. Francis. Matijasevic cannot pinpoint a reason why, but he  decided to try out for the Falcons' summer league team.  </P> <P> Goffredo was eager to get Matijasevic on his varsity squad, but he knew the  youngster would need time to develop into an impact player.  </P> <P> He was right. Matijasevic wallowed through his freshman season with the zeal of  a garden slug. He played his sophomore year, too, with minimal emotion and  effort.  </P> <P> Matijasevic says that his laziness was attributable to the size disparity  between himself and smaller players.  </P> <P> "I felt like such a dominator," he said. But true domination was a long way  off.  </P> <P> Last spring, however, expecting to be bumped up to varsity, he approached the  sport with a new dedication. He got up at 6 each weekday morning and worked out  alone at the school gym.  </P> <P> Matijasevic was still second string when Crescenta Valley played South Pasadena  in a summer league game. Goffredo started the second unit and promised not to  pull the players unless they were overwhelmed. The second stringers did not  falter and Matijasevic has been a starter ever since.  </P> <P> Matijasevic has not climbed into the coffin lately, but he hasn't renounced his  wild past, either. In fact, he says the coordination he developed skateboarding  has benefitted him on the court.  </P> <P> "I used to do tricks like flipping the board up and grabbing it -- little  nicky-nacky tricks -- but it really helped," Matijasevic said.  </P> <P> Now, Matijasevic is hoping to help Crescenta Valley contend for a league  championship.  </P> <P> "He used to have long hair and hide behind it and now he's got something to  offer," Goffredo said. "The kid did a 180 (degree turn) because of basketball  and I'm proud of that."  </P></p>

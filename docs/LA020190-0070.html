			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DUMPING EXTENDED IN SUNSHINE CANYON  </P> <P> The Los Angeles City Council agreed Wednesday to allow dumping to continue  until March 1 in the southern area of the controversial Sunshine Canyon  Landfill.  </P> <P> The council is currently permitting the landfill owner, Browning-Ferris  Industries, to operate in the southern portion of the canyon on a  month-to-month basis as long as BFI shows it is taking steps to move all of its  dumping operations to the northern end of the dump by June 30, said Greig  Smith, chief deputy to Councilman Hal Bernson.  </P> <P> Bernson has been seeking to close the landfill adjacent to Granada Hills. Two  weeks ago, Los Angeles County Public Works Department officials urged that the  existing 230-acre landfill be expanded to permit dumping on 542 acres of  BFI-owned land in an unincorporated part of the county.  </P></p>

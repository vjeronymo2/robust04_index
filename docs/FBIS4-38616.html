			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Ivan Novikov] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 30 TASS -- "President Boris Yeltsin's  latest six decrees on economic policy create conditions for the  promotion of Russian entrepreneurship and for raising the  activity of foreign investors," Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin said  here today during his meeting with the parliamentary delegation  of Kuwait. "It goes without saying that these documents will  help promote business activity in the country," he noted.    Touching on relationships between the Russian Federation and  Kuwait, the speaker said that their cooperation "could be more  resultative and effective", including in the sphere of  parliamentary contacts. "Frankly speaking, both sides have  still not used all the available opportunities," he added.    Head of the Kuwait delegation Ahmad 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Sa'dun,  chairman of the Kuwait National Assembly, thanked Russia for its  stand of principle vis-a-vis Iraq, which had unleashed an  aggression against his country. "We want this stand to remain  immutable," the guest noted.    Rybkin assured the Kuwait MPs [members of parliament] that  the Russian attitude to the friendly Kuwaiti state was  irreversible. "We want all the resolutions of the [UN] Security  Council, linked with the Gulf war, to be fully implemented," he  stressed. "At the same time," Rybkin stated, "we are perfectly  aware that it is impossible to live in conditions when there is  no peace and no war. It is necessary to achieve a situation when  the two peoples would live in conditions of good-neighbourship  and peace. The Russian MPs, together with their Kuwait  colleagues, must do their best in this noble effort."</p>

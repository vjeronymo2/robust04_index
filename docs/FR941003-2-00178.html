			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 5. The Contracts are to be used in connection with retirement plans that qualify for favorable federal income tax treatment under Section 401 or Section 408 of the Internal Revenue Code as an individual retirement plan (``Qualified Plan'') or with plans purchased on a non-tax qualified basis (``Non-Qualified Plan''). The Contracts may be used for other purposes in the future, or offered only in connection with Qualified or Non-Qualified Plans. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. The Contracts provide for minimum initial purchase payments and permit additional minimum purchase payments and periodic payments, subject to certain limitations. The Contracts provide for the accumulation of values on a variable basis determined by the investment experience of the Divisions to which the Contract owner allocates Purchase Payments. The Contracts also provide four Annuity Options for the payment of annuity benefits on a fixed and/or variable basis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. The Contracts also provide for the payment of a death benefit. If the Annuitant dies prior to the date on which annuity payments are to begin (``Retirement Date'') and before age 75, the death benefit will be equal to the greater of either; (a) Contract Value less premium taxes, if any; or (b) total purchase payments made, less any partial surrenders of Contract Value, surrender charges, periodic payments, and premium taxes, if any. If the Annuitant dies prior to Retirement Date and after age 75, the Contract Value, less premium taxes, if any, will be paid to the beneficiary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Various fees and expenses are deducted under the Contracts. An annual maintenance charge of $27 will be deducted from the Contract Value prior to the Retirement Date to compensate Great-West Life for administrative services. This charge is guaranteed not to exceed the cost of services to be provided over the life of the Contract, in accordance with the provisions of Rule 26a&hyph;1 under the 1940 Act. Great-West Life does not anticipate any profit from this charge. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. Any premium or other taxes assessed by any governmental entity will be paid by Great-West Life. If the Contract Value is used to purchase an annuity under the Annuity Options, the dollar amount of any premium tax previously paid or payable upon annuitization by Great-West Life will be charged against Contract Value. The applicable premium tax rates currently range from 0% to 2.50%. The Separate Account and the Divisions will bear their own operating expenses and charges for federal income taxes, should such taxes be incurred by Great-West Life in connection with the operation of the Separate Account. No charge is made by Great-West Life for transfers of Contract Value among the Divisions. The Contracts also are not subject to any Contract policy fee. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. No sales charges are deducted from premium payments under the Contracts. A contingent deferred sales charge (``CDSC'') is deducted on any total or partial surrender of Contract Value prior to the Retirement Date that are attributable to Purchase Payments which have been credited to a Contract for less than seven years. Up to 10% of Contract Value as of December 31 of a calendar year prior to the year in which the amount is being surrendered can be withdrawn once per year without incurring the CDSC. Additional withdrawals are subject to a surrender charge equal to a percentage of the amount distributed according to the following schedule: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 2,L2,tp0,i1,s50,12 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> &blank; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Year completed <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Maximum surrender charge percent <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 7 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2 <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 6 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3 <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 5 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4 <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 4 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5 <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 3 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6 <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 2 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7+ <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 0 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </TABLE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Total surrender charges will not exceed 7% of Purchase Payments under the Contracts. No CDSC is assessed on or after the seventh year of the Contracts. Applicants are relying on Rule 6c&hyph;8 under the 1940 Act to deduct the CDSC. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Great-West Life does not anticipate that the CDSC will generate sufficient revenues to pay the cost of distributing the Contracts. If this charge is insufficient to cover the expenses, the deficiency will be met from Great-West Life's general account assets, which may include amounts derived from the charge for mortality and expenses risks, discussed below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11. A daily charge equal to an effective annual rate of 1.25% of the net asset value of the Separate Account will be imposed to compensate Great-West Life for bearing certain mortality and expense risks in connection with the Contracts and in connection with Future Contracts. Of this amount, 0.85% is allocable to mortality risks and 0.40% is allocable to expense risks. No deduction will be made for mortality and expense risks after the Retirement Date under Contracts electing certain Annuity Options that do not vary with the investment performance of the Divisions. The mortality and expense risk charge is guaranteed never to exceed 1.25%. This charge may be a source of profit for Great-West Life which will be added to its surplus and may be used for, among other things, the payment of distribution expenses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12. The mortality risk arises from Great-West Life's contractual obligations to make Annuity Payments where one of the Life Annuity Options is selected (determined in accordance with the Annuity Tables and other provisions contained in the Contracts) regardless of how long an Annuitant may live. The mortality risk under the Contracts is the risk that, upon selection of an Annuity Option with a life contingency, Annuitants will live longer than Great-West Life's actuarial projections indicate, thereby resulting in higher than expected Annuity Payments. Great-West Life also assumes a mortality risk if the Annuitant should die prior to the Contract anniversary nearest the 75th birthday. In that event, Great-West Life is at risk to the extent that the amount of the Purchase Payments made exceed the Contract Value, less partial surrenders and surrender charges as of the date notice of death is received. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

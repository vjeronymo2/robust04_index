			<p>BFN     [Text] The head of state, General Sani Abacha, today  rounded off his tour of military formations in the country with  a visit to Lagos State.    Addressing members of the Armed Forces and the police at the  Ikeja Military Cantonment, Gen. Abacha said his visit was to  emphasize the importance of the forthcoming constitutional  conference. He said the conference would examine central issues  such as revenue allocation, alleged cases of marginalization by  ethnic groups, power sharing, as well as the suitable form of  government to be adopted. Gen. Abacha said that from past  experiences, the presidential system of government was very  [word indistinct] and quite inconsistent with the present  economic realities of the moment. The head of state assured  military personnel in Lagos State that urgent measures had  already been taken to ensure their welfare.    On Liberia, Gen. Abacha said Nigeria would soon pull out of  the West African Peacekeeping Force, ECOMOG, in Liberia. Gen.  Abacha said now that the United Nations had indicated its  intention to send peacekeepers to Liberia, it was natural that  Nigeria pulled out. He said Nigeria had contributed and,  indeed, sacrificed a lot of human and material resources to  maintain peace in that country. The head of state confirmed  that Nigeria had begun the reduction of its military strength in  the ECOMOG, saying further contingents would not be sent to that  country. Gen. Abacha expressed optimism that the Liberian  warring factions would solve their problems in their own way.</p>

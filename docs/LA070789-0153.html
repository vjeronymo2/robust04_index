			<p><P> July 7, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAL POLY ON ENVIRONMENT  </P> <P> I read with interest Anne C. Roark's article "UCLA Identifies a Major Source of  Pollution -- Itself" (Metro, June 15). Cal Poly Pomona shares UCLA's concern  about the degradation of the environment. Furthermore, we are deeply committed  to dealing with environmental issues as part of our ongoing university  operations.  </P> <P> Cal Poly Pomona has been one of the pioneers in the use of recycled waste  water. In the 1960s and 1970s, we used reclaimed water to irrigate about 25% of  the campus. Today, we rely on reclaimed water for over 95% of our campus  landscape. We also used reclaimed water to grow tree fruits, vegetables, grains  and ornamental plants.  </P> <P> Cal Poly has demonstrated its commitment to significant environmental issues in  other ways as well. In 1985, the university signed a historic agreement  establishing the Spadra Landfill and Resource Conservation Project, a joint  project between the California State University, the L.A. County Sanitation  Districts, and Los Angeles County. Combined with adjacent campus lands, this  agreement authorized the creation of a 339-acre landfill and land resource  laboratory which we call "LandLab."  </P> <P> This sanitary landfill provides opportunities for the university to conduct  research on landfill, refuse recycling, and refuse-to-energy processes and  their effects.  </P> <P> As an active laboratory for experimenting with and demonstrating ways of using  and sustaining resources, LandLab supports a diverse range of activities to  serve the educational, research, and leisure needs of the university and the  communities we serve.  </P> <P> Universities have a unique role to play in addressing the environmental  problems our society faces. Cal Poly Pomona will continue to emphasize its  commitment to addressing these critical concerns.  </P> <P> HUGH O. LA BOUNTY  </P> <P> President  </P> <P> Cal Poly Pomona  </P></p>

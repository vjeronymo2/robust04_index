			<p><P> July 23, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PACIFIC NOTES  </P> <P> A spokesman for Japanese multibillionaire Masao Nangaku said the Tokyo  businessman has not abandoned plans to build the $90-million, 35-story Minami  Tower skyscraper in downtown Las Vegas.  </P> <P> Greg Nelson, the Minami Development Corp. executive vice president who was  overseeing construction of the office complex, resigned last week during a  meeting with Nangaku in Tokyo.  </P> <P> Nelson said he stepped down after the Japanese businessman announced his  intention to walk away from the project, leaving unpaid architects and  construction workers, torn-up sidewalks and damaged streets adjacent to the  construction site.  </P> <P> Nelson said Nangaku, who also owns the Dunes Hotel on the Las Vegas Strip, is  strapped for cash and is closing down or scaling back projects worldwide.  </P> <P> However, Minami spokesman Fred Lewis denied that the project, which would  become Nevada's largest office structure, is in trouble.  </P> <P> "Greg Nelson went to Japan, got into a beef with Nangaku and quit," Lewis said  Thursday. "What we have here is a disgruntled former employee."  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 11, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: SIMI VALLEY;  </P> <P> CITY DELAYS DECISION ON WATER LIMITS  </P> <P> The Simi Valley City Council has decided to wait for the Metropolitan Water  District's assessment of a statewide drought before it decides whether to  impose mandatory water rationing.  </P> <P> The council Monday delayed action until after the district's board of  directors' meeting April 17.  </P> <P> The district, a major supplier of water to Simi Valley and other Ventura County  cities, has pushed for adoption of mandatory water-saving measures before  summer to head off increased water shortages.  </P> <P> Council members said they would prefer to continue the city's voluntary  water-saving program because it is cheaper and easier to conduct.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Vicky Howard, however, said that if necessary, the city could  implement a series of water conservation recommendations drafted when the city  faced a drought in the late 1970s. City officials said if approved, the water  rationing ordinance could be in place within 45 days.  </P> <P> MWD's largest Ventura County customer is the Calleguas Municipal Water  District, which serves the cities of Simi Valley, Moorpark and Thousand Oaks.  </P> <P> Although the water districts cannot force their customers to adopt water  rationing ordinances, the agencies could substantially increase their water  rates or limit the flow of water to cities that do not cooperate in  conservation efforts, said Michael Kleinbrodt, Simi Valley's deputy director of  public works.  </P> <P> The city of Ventura adopted an ordinance last month that limits water use by  residential and commercial customers. The ordinance, which goes into effect  Friday, also places a moratorium on hookups for new construction. CARLOS V.  LOZANO  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Bohdan Kushnir, MOLOD UKRAYINY special </F> correspondent, from Mostyskyy Rayon in Lvov Oblast: "Major of  Ukraine's Security Service Anatoliy Lysenko Celebrated the New  Year in a Polish Prison"]    [Text] Relations between the special services of  neighboring countries have always had their own traditions:  They may be good-neighborly, even friendly, or, at least,  colleagues may always find a common language. The problem lies  in what they are after. Traditions are only just taking shape in  the relations between Poland and Ukraine, because, until quite  recently, the two countries were under control of the almighty  KGB, and their special services danced to the same tune. The  history of these relations has only started to take shape,  although not in the best spirit. Its first page is the fate of  Anatoliy Lysenko, major of the Mostyskyy Rayon (in Lvov Oblast)  Department of Ukraine's Security Service.    On 23 August 1993, the major of Ukrainian special services  was arrested on the territory of Poland and accused of  espionage. It is already the fourth month that Anatoliy has  been under investigation. The trial will be held soon. It is a  strange case -- the major was arrested not far from the border.  On his trip to Poland, Anatoliy was accompanied by his whole  family -- wife, student daughter, and a little son. He did not  receive permission to leave from his authorities -- for lack of  time. Doctors insisted on the fourth operation on his son, and  the parents decided to seek the advice of an experienced Polish  specialist. In addition, there was nobody he could ask  permission from -- the chief was away on leave, and his deputies  were afraid to take the responsibility upon themselves. The  Lysenko family decided to go to Rzeszow on their own, though  they did have corresponding documents for crossing the border.    Nowhere in the history of special services worldwide will  one  find a precedent in which a whole family would be engaged in  spying. The version maintaining that Major Lysenko collected  intelligence information seems, to put it mildly, doubtful not  only to professionals. It is a different matter that the Poles,  taking advantage of the distress of the Lysenko family, did  everything in order to lure the major to their territory. The  first officer, who was in charge of the Mostyskyy Customs House  and who, apparently, ensured free border crossings for more than  one cargo, could not but interest his Polish colleagues. The  Mostyskyy Customs House is the gate to Western Europe, and  officers of the local department of Ukraine's Security Service  are a Klondike of intelligence information. The "proofs" of  espionage about which Lysenko's wife writes in her appeal to the  Ukrainian president, are ridiculous. Lysenko allegedly asked one  Pole to bring a few newspapers from Poland; another time, he  asked about who was going to head the religious community in  Przemysl and when the clergyman there would be replaced.  Finally, the most serious accusation -- he helped a Polish  citizen to bypass Customs. Based upon a testimony of their  citizen, Polish special services charged the major with  espionage and applied to him an article of the Criminal Code  envisaging between five and 15 years imprisonment or capital  punishment.    Although, Major Lysenko has yet another choice -- to betray  his fatherland. The Poles are offering him a job in their  special services, to bring his family, and adopt Polish  citizenship.    Meanwhile, Ukraine's Security Service, having abandoned  their  colleague to the mercy of fate, maintains calm and pretends that  nothing has happened. The Poles show greater interest in  Lysenko's case, because they already repeatedly hinted that  Ukrainian leaders should come to his rescue. Judging by  numerous hints, it is not just a matter of Anatoliy Lysenko's  fate. It appears that we are dealing here with the worst  variant of relations between special services, where the rule  "tit for tat" is in effect. Consequently, Ukrainian special  services pushed their Polish colleagues to a decisive step, or  else the Poles decided that attack was the best type of defense.  As a result, Ukraine's Security Service Major Anatoliy Lysenko  celebrates the coming of the New Year in a Polish prison, his  wife Olena haunts the thresholds of high-ranking officials, who  can only help by appointing a lawyer. Perhaps, they do not want  to help? It only remains for us to wonder what kind of logic  the Polish special services adhered to by picturing a modest  rayon official as the greatest Ukrainian spy. It is possible  that Anatoliy does not even have an idea about this. Now, his  colleagues will welcome him as a hero....</p>

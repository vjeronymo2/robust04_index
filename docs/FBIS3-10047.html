			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Roberto Orozco B.] </F>   [Text] The Sandinist People's Army [EPS] will continue  offensive actions against groups of rearmed individuals who have  not accepted the demobilization of the 3-80 Northern Front,  including the groups led by "Charro" and "Northiel" [Roberto  Garcia Castro], EPS spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Jaime Wheelock  has said.    "Charro" and "Northiel" will be fought in spite of the  efforts by Jose Angel Talavera, alias Commander "Chacal," to  gather the troops of these two rebel chieftains and demobilize  them together with the 3-80 Northern Front. The EPS confirmed  yesterday that "Charro" and "Northiel" refused to attend a  meeting between the government and the 3-80 Northern Front in  Caulatu, Quilali, where both parties signed an agreement that  will bring peace in northern Nicaragua.    Charro's troops two days ago attacked the town of Mulukuku,  where the police had to flee when they could not fight them.  According to police sources, there were only five law  enforcement officers in this town. Mulukuku was attacked a  second time by the recontras under the command of "Aguila  Negra," "Arandu," and "Alacran," all of them subordinates of  "Charro." In the first attack in February 1993, three policemen  were murdered.    According to journalist Aurora Leyton Morales -- our  correspondent in Matagalpa -- the 19-year old Daniel Ochoa  Castro was killed in this attack when the rearmed men tried to  kidnap him. The following persons who had demobilized from the  Nicaraguan Resistance received bullet wounds: Rosario Suarez  Guido, 24; Miguel Angel Fernandez, 30; Justo Ortiz, 27; and  Gregorio Sanchez, 44. Charro's troops also looted some shops,  bars, and restaurants.    "The peace agreement exclusively protects the 3-80 Northern  Front. "Charro" and "Northiel" do not belong to that group;  they form part of another organization that has mixed political  and criminal connotations, Lt. Col. Wheelock pointed out.  "Nonetheless, the political banners being waged by `Charro' and  `Northiel' are disregarded because they refuse to demobilize.  They will be fought by the Army, just like it fights criminal  bands," Wheelock emphasized.    Wheelock also referred the agreements signed yesterday in  Caulatu. After making a summary of the same, he reported that  the EPS yesterday sent food for 400 men, and that the Health  Ministry sent a medical brigade to treat the wounded from the  3-80 Northern Front. That is all part of the agreements signed  yesterday at Caulatu. He added that the EPS, CIAV-OAS  [International Commission of Support and Verification-OAS], and  the rebel group will keep in contact and will coordinate actions  to prevent any incidents in the future, and that "when we have  to enter the enclave, they will be informed first."    He confirmed that the 3-80 Northern Front will demobilize in  three stages, beginning on 2 March when 100 men disarm. The  second stage will begin on 16 March, when 50 percent of those  remaining will demobilize, while on 8 April, the rest of the  fighters and the Council of Commanders of the 3-80 Northern  Front led by "Chacal" will rejoin civilian life.</p>

			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / California bill seeks to ward off UK tax retaliation CALIFORNIA'S Senate has passed a bill that legislators hope will settle the British government's complaints about the state's system of worldwide unitary tax assessment and ward off retaliation against California-based companies operating in the UK. The bill, which is expected to be considered by the state assembly's revenue and taxation committee today, would address the three main complaints foreign companies make about the operation of the California tax system. Since 1988, companies have been able to choose an alternative, known as water's edge assessment, to the controversial unitary system, but have had to pay a fee for this election. The new bill would abolish this fee and eliminate some additional paperwork. It would also remove the right of the California tax authorities to override a company's choice of the water's edge system. The US federal administration is hoping that the bill will enable it to avoid taking sides between California and the UK in a case brought by Barclays Bank against unitary taxation now pending before the Supreme Court. British business groups and MPs have said the new legislation does not meet their demands because it preserves elements of the unitary system, and are urging the UK government to maintain its threat to refuse Californian companies a tax credit they now receive if the issue is not settled by the end of this year. Under a unitary assessment California may tax a company on a proportion of its worldwide income, rather than only on income earned within the state. Because this method of assessment conflicts with the methods used by other countries and contained in the US's bilateral tax treaties, it can give rise to double taxation.</p>

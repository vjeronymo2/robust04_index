			<p><P> June 17, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HALT THE DECLINE AT MONO LAKE  </P> <P> Los Angeles should realize by now that it never will win its dogged legal  battle to continue its historic diversion of eastern Sierra streams that  naturally flow into Mono Lake. As long as the Department of Water and Power  takes as much water as it has over the years, the level of the unique lake 300  miles north of Los Angeles will continue to drop. At some point, the decline  must be halted. Now is an appropriate time because any further reduction is  certain to trigger additional environmental damage, according to a long series  of scientific studies that have been conducted over the years.  </P> <P> Curiously, the DWP argued in El Dorado County Superior Court last week that it  needs to lower the lake even further so it can conduct even more scientific  studies to see whether, indeed, there would be any environmental harm. But one  could follow that line of reasoning on and on, until the lake is a lake no  more. Mono Lake now is 6,377 feet above sea level, very close to its historic  low and the point at which Negrit Island, an important nesting area for the  California gull, is connected to the shore by a land bridge and thus becomes  accessible to coyotes and other predators.  </P> <P> Four studies have recommended that the lake level not be allowed to drop below  6,377 feet and that it be maintained at between 6,377 feet and 6,390 feet. The  Mono Lake Committee and the Audubon Society argued for an injunction to halt  the decline at 6,377 feet. There is plenty of evidence in the 10-year court  fight over Mono Lake to justify such a ruling. The lake level has dropped 40  feet since the diversions began in 1941.  </P> <P> The city, of course, will lose water -- an estimated 63,000 acre-feet during  the next year, or about 15% of the city's annual consumption. The department  also will lose the electric power generated as the water falls through the Los  Angeles Aqueduct en route to the city. Negotiations are under way to find  replacement water. Until that is achieved, the city can make up the loss from  its entitlement from the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California.  </P> <P> Both city officials and state Assemblyman Phillip Isenberg (D-Sacramento) are  right when they say the state and federal governments should help compensate  Los Angeles, since Mono Lake needs to be protected both as a statewide and  national environmental asset. Isenberg is sponsoring legislation to do that.  And he noted correctly in a recent speech: "If we don't step in, Los Angeles is  going to lose about 10 years from now, but the lake will be dead. And that will  be no victory at all."  </P></p>

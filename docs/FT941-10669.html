			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / International Company News: CanPac cuts loss as rail freight improves Canadian Pacific, the transport, resource, property and industrial group, reduced losses sharply in the fourth quarter and for the whole of 1993 following a considerable turnround on the freight rail side. CP, which also benefited from an improvement in shipping and trucks, recorded positive operating results and is forecasting further gains for 1994. Fourth-quarter net profit from continuing operations was CDollars 107m (USDollars 81.6m), up from CDollars 44m a year earlier. But after special charges there was a loss of CDollars 117.5m, or 37 cents a share, against a loss of CDollars 254m, or 80 cents. Revenues rose to CDollars 1.8bn from CDollars 1.6bn. For the full year, overall net profit from continuing operations was CDollars 267m, compared with CDollars 140m, but after special items the loss was CDollars 191m, or 60 cents, against a deficit of CDollars 478m, or CDollars 1.50. Revenues of CDollars 6.6bn compared with CDollars 7.2bn, mostly due to the de-consolidation of two units. The 1993 special items included a CDollars 203m share of write-downs by Unitel, the telecommunications unit. The rail system almost doubled operating income in 1993, with strong gains in traffic.</p>

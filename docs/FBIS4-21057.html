			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Renato Cordeiro: "More Violent Baixada"] </F>   [Text] The move by big traffickers from Rio de Janeiro to  extend their operations to shantytowns in Baixada Fluminense is  worrying police and threatening to reverse the trend in that  region's homicide rate, which has been declining for the past  five years. According to Police Chief Paulo Souto, director of  the Baixada General Police Department, the past six months have  seen a significant increase in the number of drug traffickers in  the area's municipalities, resulting in battles between "native"  outlaws and those migrating from Rio de Janeiro.    In the police chief's opinion, that explains the scare  caused  by last weekend's violence, during which 27 homicides were  reported in Baixada Fluminense--the highest figure in three  years. Souto said he had already identified Rio de Janeiro gangs  dominating the traffic in places such as the Lixao shantytown in  Duque de Caxias--which is constantly being invaded by  traffickers from Vigario Geral--and Vila Norma on the border  between Sao Jose de Meriti and Nilopolis.    Flight--According to the police chief, the outlaws are  trying  to leave Rio de Janeiro in search of more control or, in some  cases, to escape repression in the capital's shantytowns. "The  homicide rate had been falling thanks to our efforts to  prioritize repression of the extermination groups. What is  happening now is a new causative factor," Souto said.    Decline--January provided one indication of the rising  number  of murders in the region: 197 compared to 176 in December. The  data for February are not yet complete, but there were probably  176 murders that month, whereas March is showing another  increase. Over the past five years, police have been recording a  decline in the number of murders: 2,683 in 1989, 2,572 in 1990,  2,256 in 1991, 2,090 in 1992, and 2,040 in 1993. The  municipality of Queimados, which has the smallest population in  Baixada Fluminense, had five murders between Friday night and  Sunday night, making it proportionately the most violent  municipality that weekend.</p>

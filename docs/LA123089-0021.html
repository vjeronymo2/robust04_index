			<p><P> December 30, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BREA-OLINDA BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT;  </P> <P> STEWART GIVES BREA A RETURN TO THE FINAL  </P> <P> Brea-Olinda High School point guard Rodney Stewart made the most of his second  chance Friday night.  </P> <P> Stewart sent his team into overtime by missing the front end of a one-and-one  late in regulation. But he drilled an 18-foot jumper with a second left in  overtime to give Brea a 64-63 victory over St. John Bosco in a championship  semifinal of Brea's tournament.  </P> <P> Brea (10-3) will meet Compton (13-2), in the championship game at 8:30 tonight.  It will be Brea's fifth consecutive trip to the final.  </P> <P> St. John Bosco Coach Tim Haley must have had a scouting report on Stewart, who  had missed the front ends of a pair of one-and-ones in the final minute  Thursday night in Brea's victory over Fallbrook.  </P> <P> Haley had his team foul Stewart in the backcourt with 45 seconds left in  regulation and St. John Bosco trailing, 57-54.  </P> <P> Stewart's free throw clanked off the rim and St. John Bosco's Bob Mendoza  grabbed the rebound. With 10 seconds left, Mario Saucedo hit a three-pointer  from the baseline to force overtime.  </P> <P> The teams traded leads in overtime until St. John Bosco center Fidencio Saldana  put in a follow shot to give the Braves (6-8) a 63-62 lead with 12 seconds  left.  </P> <P> On Brea's final possession, Stewart looked to get the ball to leading scorer  Keith Walker, but he was double-teamed. So Stewart, who finished with nine  points, got free just inside the three-point line and hit the winning jump shot  with a second left.  </P> <P> St. John Bosco point guard Dashon Quiette made six three-pointers to lead his  team with 18 points.  </P> <P> Walker led all scorers with 32 points, but was held to just five after the  fourth quarter.  </P> <P> In other tournament games:  </P> <P> Sunny Hills 57, Buena Park 54 -- Buena Park forward Jamal Collins led all  scorers with 19 points. Sunny Hills was led by Dominic Carnesi's 16 and Kenny  Overby's 14.  </P> <P> El Modena 64, Sonora 52 -- Guard Greg Gottlieb of El Modena led all scorers  with 32 points.  </P> <P> Bakersfield Foothill 57, La Habra 35 -- Foothill was led by Kenzi Smith and  Fuzzy Robinson with 12 points apiece.  </P> <P> El Dorado 73, Whittier Christian 72 (OT) -- El Dorado guard Mike Bradach was  the game's leading scorer with 26 points, including a pair of three-pointers.  </P></p>

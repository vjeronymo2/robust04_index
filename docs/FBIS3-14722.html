			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Trade: Slight Decline"] </F>   [Text] The first estimates of Morocco's 1993 global trade  volume show a decrease of about 0.7 percent, from 96.764 to 96.1  billion dirhams[DH] .    Import figures are expected to decline by 1.1 percent, to  62.1 billion dirhams in 1993 compared with DH62.805 billion in  1992, whereas exports should remain stable at DH34 billion.    The trade balance deficit should slightly improve, from  DH28.846 billion in 1992 to 28.1 billion in 1993, i.e., a  2.6-percent decrease.    The rate of coverage of imports by exports should rise from  54.1 percent in 1992 to 54.8 percent in 1993.    The current account balance should show a deficit of DH5.5  billion, 46.7 percent more than in 1992. Foreign investments  should account for 90 percent of this deficit financing: they  are said to amount DHto 4.5 billion, 4.7 percent more than in  1992.    Revenues from subcontracting are said to have increased by  23.5 percent in 1993, to DH2.9 billion.    The balance of payments remains positive, at DH2.75 billion  dirhams, although the debt rescheduling cycle has ended.  Actually, the outstanding debt was reduced by 1.2 percent, from  $21.3 billion in 1992 to $21.05 billion in 1993.    Finally, foreign currency reserves should amount to about  DH36 billion, (a 14.5 percent increase over 1992) representing  seven months of goods imports, compared with six months last  year.</p>

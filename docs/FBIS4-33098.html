			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Rosa Icela Rodriguez] </F>   [Text] Yesterday, when the Movement for Democratic  Transition [Movimiento por la Transicion Democratica] was  created, it was announced that it would support Cuauhtemoc  Cardenas' campaign to conduct a democratic struggle to return  the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) to legitimacy  because it is currently being "held hostage by various  factions." Initially, the movement is expected to include some  100 PRD leaders and candidates for the Chamber of Deputies and  Senate.    A document that served as a basis for a discussion at this  meeting at PRD National Headquarters states that the government,  with the support of the media, "has unleashed a smear campaign  against Cuauhtemoc Cardenas and the PRD" -- a campaign to which  "PRD followers have not known how to respond" because "the PRD's  internal problems have hampered and to a great extent paralyzed  its political activity."    The document recognizes that "today's prevailing political  climate is one of division and confrontation," and what has  caused this is the way candidates for deputies and senators were  chosen -- "under the hegemony of internal factions that placed  group interests above national interests, thereby seriously  hurting internal stability and, moreover, hurting the party's  ability to provide the people with solutions to resolve the  country's great problems."    At the meeting, which was attended by PRD members Francisco  Kuri, Gilberto Rincon Gallardo, Rene Arce, Arnoldo Martinez  Verdugo, Cuauhtemoc Sandoval, and others, those in attendance  criticized the fact that "the PRD structure has been overrun by  interest groups calling themselves factions."    Likewise, they criticized the fact that "internal disputes  have lacked political foresight, programmatic formulas, and  tactics. But the most serious aspect of this situation has been  the casting aside of PRD members who do not belong to any  faction -- those who act separately within grass-root  organizations in municipal and district committees."    They stressed: "This is not the image of the PRD that is  sought or wished by those of us who have gathered together to  form this movement" and who have "shared with a large sector of  the party's grass roots our opposition to the methods and  behavior of these groups, which have made hegemonic decisions at  all levels of the party and have even placed at risk the  organized activities of the Executive Committee and the National  Council."    They continued: "In view of this situation, a group of us,  all PRD members who took part in the party's founding and have  devoted ourselves to the tasks of building the party and  developing its policies and programs, have decided to form a  group and become an instrument of political work within the PRD,  and, in this way, we will fulfill the goals that our statutes  establish."</p>

			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / International Company News: American Airlines forecasts greater loss Shares in American Airlines, the second-biggest US carrier, fell by Dollars 1 to Dollars 63 yesterday as the company confirmed reports that it was heading for worse-than-expected losses in its first quarter. The Texas-based airline refused to put a figure on the losses, but said they would be greater than the 24 cents a share being forecast by Wall Street analysts. In last year's first quarter the airline lost Dollars 22m, or 43 cents a share. Earlier the shares were suspended after the Dallas Morning News quoted American Airlines pilots as saying the airline's first-quarter net losses could exceed Dollars 100m. They said they had been told in a meeting by Mr Robert Crandall, chairman of American Airlines, that the carrier lost Dollars 59m in February after losing money in January. They also said Mr Crandall wanted to increase the airline's productivity and re-enter some of the markets it had left. American Airlines later disputed the figures, saying it lost Dollars 46m in February because of bad weather and low fares. It would not comment on the newspaper's report that airline executives were expecting full-year profits of Dollars 150m.</p>

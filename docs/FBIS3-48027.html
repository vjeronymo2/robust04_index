Justice Denis Ong Jiew Fook of the Miri High Court passed  the  sentence after hearing mitigation from Pairin's counsel, Raja  Aziz Adruse, and a reply from senior federal counsel Abdul Gani  Patail.    He took about an hour and 21 minutes to decide on the  sentence which was greeted with loud applause from the public  gallery.    The charge under Section (1) of the Emergency (Essential  Cases) Ordinance 1970, carries a maximum fine of 20,000 ringgit  or a jail term not exceeding 14 years, or both upon conviction.    Pairin, 53, was found guilty of using his position as the  chief minister to commit a corrupt practice by approving a  1.48-million ringgit contract for the Sabah Economic Development  Corporation's shophouse project in Tambunan to Rimkaya Co. Ltd.,  in which his relatives were the directors-cum-shareholders.    He committed the offence at his office in the Sabah  Foundation building in Likas here, on September 11, 1985.    During the trial, which lasted 96 days, the prosecution  witnesses testified that Justin Alip and Jude Edward Kessy were  Pairin's brothers-in-law and Rimkaya's  directors-cum-shareholders.    Pairin, in his defence, said he was not aware that any of  his  brothers-in-law was involved with Rimkaya which was given the  second phase of Tambunan shophouse contract.    He was defended by Anthony Scrivener, QC [Queen Counsel],  Raja Aziz Addruse, Douglas Primus, Datuk Chau Chin Tang, and  James Tsai, while Gani prosecuted, assisted by Ahmad Bache.</p>

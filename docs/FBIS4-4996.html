			<p>BFN     [Text] The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications [MOPT]  has started working on a project to promote the interconnection  of locally operated cable television networks and to support the  development of a multimedia services system which will link  cable television services with telephone and other  communications services. In addition to compiling a set of  technical criteria for the connection of networks, the MOPT  plans to conduct experiments into making practical use of  cordless phones by utilizing cable television networks and  eventually establishing cordless phone networks. Since the MOPT  eased regulations concerning cable television services last  December, it is possible that with the implementation of the new  MOPT project, more trading firms and foreign cable television  companies may now enter the market.    Currently, approximately 1.08 million households throughout  the nation have subscribed to cable television companies. This  network has drawn much attention because of the possibility that  it could compete favorably with the Nippon Telegraph and  Telephone Corporation (NTT) network as a new data communications  infrastructure. The MOPT's new project is aimed at encouraging  the joint development of new services which will merge  communications with broadcasting and the mutual provision of  such services by connecting cable television networks, which are  dispersed throughout the nation, with networks run by new  common-carrier companies.    According to plans, consideration will be given to the  process of standardizing the interconnection of cable television  networks, with the Cable Television Council (Kohei Kogure,  chairman), which consists of 158 cable television companies,  playing the major role. Studies will also be made of ways to  solve technical problems regarding the joint use of different  cable television networks in bidirectional services, such as  video-on-demand with which viewers can see video programs at any  time they want to.    By experimenting with cordless phones, it is hoped that a  new  business can be established whereby subscribing households and  other users can talk with each other by utilizing cable  television networks. The cordless phone system enables cordless  home phones to be used outdoors. Among its numerous advantages  are that the entire system itself is very simple, with  construction costs for automated transmission stations being  considerably lower than the costs of constructing such stations  for mobile telephone systems. One shortcoming of the system is  that cordless phones cannot be used when a user is traveling at  high speeds, but phone bills can be cheaper than for regular  mobile telephone systems.    Currently, experiments are being conducted primarily using  NTT's local telephone networks in Tokyo, Sapporo, and other  cities, but so far there has been no case of experiments using  cable television networks. The MOPT plans to first conduct  experiments by calling on cable television companies in Tokyo.  It then plans to connect cable television stations together in  the future to expand the areas of coverage.    As for plans to link cable television networks with  communications services, the Mitsubishi Corporation, Mitsui and  Company, Ltd., the Tokyo Electric Power Company, Ltd., and the  Tokyu Corporation have concluded a tie-up, in view of developing  the multimedia industry in the future. The MOPT's project is  expected to boost such moves among private firms.</p>

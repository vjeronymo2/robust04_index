			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / UK Company News: ICD mounts sharp recovery to Pounds 0.2m International Communications and Data, the marketing services group subject to a recent unwelcome bid, recovered from a Pounds 1.17m loss to report a pre-tax profit of Pounds 191,000 in the six months to November 30. Mr David Cicurel, chairman, attributed the improvement to a strong performance by ICD Marketing Services, the elimination of losses and the near-halving of central costs and interest. He hit out at PSB Group, the direct marketing concern, which he said 'had attempted to obtain backdoor management control of ICD without making an offer to all shareholders.' Resolutions put forward by PSB, which claims to control 23.6 per cent of ICD's voting rights, were defeated at an EGM in December. PSB had sought the removal of the majority of ICD's existing directors and their replacement by PSB nominees. Mr Cicurel said that associates of PSB had since indicated that they were considering making an offer for the company. 'If this were to take place at a fair price it would be a successful outcome to the upheavals of last autumn,' he added. In December PSB launched a counter bid for ICD, after IMC Industries, in which Mr Cicurel is a large shareholder, was forced into a mandatory bid after exercising a share option. The USM-quoted soft drinks and leisure company said it did not wish to gain ICD, however, and pitched its offer at the lowest price permitted under the takeover code. ICD received Pounds 486,000 from the share option. This gave IMC a 10.6 per cent stake in ICD and with its supporters, IMC now claims to hold about 40 per cent. The defence costs of the PSB bid amounted to Pounds 110,000 and were charged as an exceptional item against the half year profit. Turnover on continuing operations came to Pounds 2.91m (Pounds 2.44m), while earnings per share were 0.34p (2.05p losses).</p>

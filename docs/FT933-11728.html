			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Arts: Behind the gilded curtain - Theatre There is something irresistible about backstage plays. Being taken behind the scenes is like being shown how a clock works. And to give attention to the unhymned components of theatre - the dresser, the chorus line - is to cast judicious light on lives of the obscure. Though Richard Crane's Under the Stars is no great example of this genre, it is satisfying simply because it is all about understudies. Stella and Regina are covering two Great (and Old) Actresses of the London stage during a West End run. Out there, on the stage we never see, the two stars, 'Trixie' and 'the Dame,' are playing Helen and Clytemnestra, long after the Trojan War, in a preposterous trough of verse drama called Helen in Argos. Down here, at the other end of the tannoy system, Stella and Regina listen and wait. Stella is all method, motivation, and neurosis; and she never knows all her lines. Regina, who has understudied the Dame for 25 years, is an old pro who can duplicate everything the Dame does; but, since she never goes on, she concentrates on knitting and shopping at Sainsbury. For so plotless a set-up, Crane has worked too hard to provide a plot. (Trixie gets ill and faints onstage, only to recover and carry on, before Stella has a chance to finish identifying with Helen and to get onstage in her stead. The director, assuming Trixie will be hospitalised, brings in a Known Actress to cover the role of Helen.) And each character is too much of a theatrical cartoon. Stella's feckless clinging to method, Regina's dogged insistence on routine - these are too coarsely exaggerated. The director is merely a smug creep, the Known Actress merely the standard ambitious bitch. The Dame and Trixie, whose voices we hear over the tannoy, are equally ludicrous, but there is fun to be had in listening to the (recorded) voices of Patricia Routledge and June Whitfield intoning the ghastly verse of Helen in Argos. Routledge (as the Dame playing Clytemnestra) belts out her lines in a beefy basso profundo - con molto vibrato; Whitfield (as Trixie as Helen) quavers hers out in a tremolo so massive that it sounds like a trill spanning a minor third - or like yodelling. Connie Booth and Pam Ferris play Stella and Regina effectively, in diametrically opposed styles. Booth is fey, Ferris fierce; Booth all self-obsessed sensitivity, Ferris all practical sense. But, under Matthew Francis's direction, this backstage world hangs fire. Both (especially Ferris) occasionally follow the playwright into the temptation of hamming up straight material; the pacing (especially Booth's) is sometimes insufficiently natural and too pat. There is greater drama in this situation than Crane knew how to discover; and there is more truth in these roles than Booth and Ferris have yet disclosed. At the Greenwich Theatre, until August 28.</p>

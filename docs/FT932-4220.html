			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / Economic Viewpoint: Why German costs now look so high A spectre is beginning to haunt the European Community, that of Euro-competitiveness - or rather the lack of it. It is invoked by protectionists in industries such as steel, coal and textiles, who ask how western European industry can compete - to use the fashionable exaggeration  -with Czech workers on a 10th of the EC wage, or south-east Asian workers on a 40th. It is used as an argument against fuel taxes or other anti-pollution measures. The threat of 'Europe becoming uncompetitive' is even used in support of good causes such as flexible working hours, or when arguing against social chapter-type proposals which would raise labour costs. It is also likely that, for want of anything else, Euro-competitiveness will be the rabbit that the European Commission president, Jacques Delors, will pull out of the hat when he presents his own document on recession and unemployment to EC leaders at the Copenhagen summit. For it will appeal both to the protectionists and to the more superficial free market advocates. It will also give the Community a ragged flag around which to rally when trying to act tough in trade matters with the US or ex-communist countries. Yet it is mostly a muddle. There is a vague sense in which western Europe is losing relative position, and China and the other Asian developing countries are catching up - although that is not the same thing as lack of competitiveness. The average growth rate of the EC since 1975 has been about 2 per cent a year and that of the US a shade higher. On the other hand, Asian countries have been growing as a group by 6 to 7 per cent a year. The more successful developing countries will thus account, if they maintain their momentum, for a larger part of world output, relative to the older industrial countries. This is a natural and desirable catching-up process. A small group of North Atlantic countries cannot hope to stay in the lead forever. How about another conventional, if disputable, index of competitiveness, the current balance of payments? In the EC as a whole, a deficit has emerged equivalent to just under 1 per cent of its combined GDP with the rest of the world, and its financing causes no trouble. If there is a problem of uncompetitiveness in the mundane sense of a pattern of costs and exchange rates so high as to price products out of world markets, it is almost exclusively a German one. There have been many French business complaints about losing competitiveness to Italy, Spain and the UK as a result of recent devaluations. This, however, has been made up by the improvement of competitiveness against Germany which started in 1988 and has been increasing in momentum. The measurement of the real exchange rate is difficult and controversial. But IMF indices of normalised unit labour costs, adjusted for exchange rate variation, suggest France is just as competitive as it was two years ago - although slightly less than one year ago - and has retained most of the gains of the late 1980s. Germany, on the other hand, suffered an explosive increase in unit labour costs after unification. The adjoining chart may give an exaggerated impression because of the inclusion of rapidly rising east German wages unconnected with productivity gains. That surely, however, is part of Germany's problem. If the German authorities did not care about inflation, cutting interest rates sharply and letting the D-Mark fall would be a way of stimulating the economy in a short-term and superficial way. It would remove one source of tension with its neighbours by allowing European interest rates to fall, but probably gain another by giving rise to complaints of competitive depreciation. Of course, the Bundesbank has no desire for a D-Mark depreciation - a high real exchange rate helps to damp down German inflationary pressures. Nevertheless, the chart does make the case for a French depreciation against the D-Mark, on which so many market scribes were recently keen, seem ludicrous. Indeed a bigger, if slightly longer-term, problem is the risk of the D-Mark taking an undesired drop. The fact that George Soros has come independently to the same conclusion does not make it true. But it is at least a straw in the wind. Even with the present policy of small and stately cuts in German interest rates, there is clear downside risk on the D-Mark. But France and Germany's smaller neighbours have inflation rates up to 2 per cent less than Germany's, which makes their own real interest rates correspondingly higher and more painful at a time of general recession. Maybe the increase in German costs can be treated as once and for all, and the D-Mark can be kept high on the basis of a tough monetary policy offsetting a big budget deficit and swollen internal costs. Yet this is no basis for a stable European Monetary System. A comparison can be made with the strong dollar of President Reagan's early years, when Fed tight money was offsetting a large US budget deficit. The combination would have been no basis for a worldwide monetary system. Ideally, France should take over the role of anchor country from Germany. Taking over the anchor role is not something that can be done overnight by firing a gun from the Elysee Palace. The Banque de France has got away in recent weeks with periods when very short-term interest rates have been a tiny fraction below Germany's. But the tie-up with German rates is still close. What could happen in the period ahead is a gradual differential fall in the interest rates of the countries which form the hard core of the exchange rate mechanism. In other words, a sizeable interest rate differential could eventually develop against Germany, as French and other interest rates fall slightly faster. The interest rate gap would be the insurance premium Germany would have to pay to offset the risks of a D-Mark depreciation. This would be a sharp break with the image that people have formed of the German economy and currency. But stranger and sharper breaks have occurred in the past. Similar charts show that Japan has also had a sharp rise in its real exchange rate. In the past, Japan has been better than other countries at reversing such movements through a mixture of productivity gains and wage moderation. Its ability to do so is now more open to question, and the American campaign for a higher yen is singularly ill-advised. The Bank of Japan could, however, help to reverse at least part of the yen appreciation by still easier and cheaper money, and not assume that present 3.3 per cent short-term interest rates are necessarily rock bottom. The country that has gained the greatest competitive advantage is undoubtedly the UK. On an IMF unit labour cost basis, costs corrected for exchange rates are 15 to 20 per cent below what they were before departure from the ERM, and about 10 per cent lower than when the British government was shadowing the D-Mark in the winter of 1987-88. It is hard work persuading continental friends that this depreciation was forced on the government. Any further depreciation of sterling - whether intentional as the Red/Black coalition of critics on the government's left and right would like, or as a by-product of attempts to push recovery faster - would lead to accusations of competitive devaluation in earnest and could even put the single market at risk. The ERM may have had its fault lines, but these are nothing compared with the defects of unbridled currency nationalism.</p>

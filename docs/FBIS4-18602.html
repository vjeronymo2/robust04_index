			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report]  <H8>  Old Parties' Losses, Greens' Gains Viewed </H8>   German commentators widely remarked that the 20 March local  elections in Schleswig-Holstein demonstrated that any fears of  widespread voter apathy were unjustified, with some calling the  results a "warning" to the established parties, and others  seeing increased prospects for a Social Democratic-Greens  coalition in Bonn. Most analyses, however, also conceded the  dangers of drawing conclusions about national politics based on  local electoral results.  <H5>  High Turnout Welcomed </H5>   Several commentators pointed to the high voter turnout in  Schleswig- Holstein as a sign that concern over widespread  popular alienation from politics was misplaced. About 70.4  percent of eligible voters went to the polls--up slightly from  69.4 percent during the last local elections in 1990--and  turnout for the previous week's Lower Saxon state elections was  at a similar level. Peter Heinacher, writing in the 22 March  HANDELSBLATT, called the high turnout "the most apparent and, at  the same time, most reassuring" result of the Schleswig-Holstein  elections. A 22 March FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE commentary agreed,  pointing out that there was "no sign of the weariness with  voting" which had been predicted, and an article in the same  day's TAGESZEITUNG virtually repeated this theme, noting that  "the Germans apparently do not intend, after all, to tire of  voting."  <H5>  `Warning' to Old Parties Seen </H5>   Less reassuringly, however, Herbert Kremp opined in the 22  March DIE WELT that while "there is no frustration with  politics...there is massive frustration with the established  parties." All three traditional parties lost ground statewide  compared to 1990, with the Social Democratic Party (SPD)  declining from 42.9 to about 39.5 percent, the Christian  Democratic Union (CDU) slipping from 41.3 to around 37.5  percent, and the Free Democratic Party (FDP) dropping from 6.1  to about 4.4 percent. Several commentators remarked on this  development, contrasting it with the improved performance of the  Greens (up from 6.0 to 10.3 percent), the Danish-minority  Southern Schleswig Voters' Association (up from 1.6 to 2.6  percent) and the state's characteristic Independent Voters'  Associations (up from 1.2 to around 3.9 percent). Commentaries  or related articles in the 22 March editions of the SUEDDEUTSCHE  ZEITUNG, HANDELSBLATT, and DIE WELT described these results as a  "warning" (Denkzettel) to the traditional parties, although the  22 March FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE commentary was more cautious,  arguing only that such results could signal "a slight turn away"  from the "emphatically political parties."  <H5>  `Red-Green Signals' Detected </H5>   Some commentators highlighted the gains by the Greens--who  had also increased their share of the vote in Lower Saxony--and  pointed to them as a sign that an SPD-Green coalition at the  federal level was a real possibility. The FRANKFURTER  ALLGEMEINE commentary adopted the relatively understated view  that the Greens had succeeded in increasing their vote to the  "normal" level. Possibly referring to the perceived radicalism  of the Greens' national platform, the commentator remarked that  "apparently, a certain category of voter...cannot be prevented  from voting for the Greens." Kremp, in the 22 March DIE WELT,  saw a more dynamic trend with national implications, describing  the Greens' progress as a "breakthrough" which is "taking place  on a broad front in Germany," and specifically citing "red-green  earnestness" as one clear lesson from the Schleswig-Holstein  vote. Heinacher, however, drew the most explicit conclusions  for the election's impact on the federal campaign. "After the  Greens' successes in Lower Saxony and Schleswig Holstein," he  wrote in his 22 March HANDELSBLATT commentary, "Red-green  signals are going out from the far north toward Bonn."  <H5>  Interpretive Risks Noted </H5>   Most analyses, however, also pointed to the uncertainties  involved in divining national trends from the results of local  elections. "Regional particularities mix with countrywide  trends," noted the SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG commentator, diminishing  the vote's importance as a predictor of state or federal  elections. Kremp expressed similar reservations in DIE WELT,  describing any individual's vote as a combination of his  "impressions of the chancellor, the opposition, and [each  party's] local performance." A commentary in the 25 March DIE  ZEIT went a step further, criticizing efforts to force a  national interpretation on an essentially local event, "if  necessary with a crowbar." Seeing little connection between  local elections and national political trends, the DIE ZEIT  analysis concluded with the admonition that "a local election is  a local election is a local election."</p>

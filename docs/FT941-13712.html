			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / Economic Diary: Other economic news Monday: The Confederation of British Industry produces its quarterly economic trends survey, a far-reaching report on manufacturing industry, which should confirm that the improved pace of recovery continued into the first quarter of this year. It should also show that price and cost pressures remain subdued. Tuesday: November construction and new order figures for the UK are released. Recent figures have shown an improvement in the construction market, and industry will watch today's figures to check that the gains have been sustained. Friday: US GDP is forecast to have risen an annualised 5.2 per cent in the fourth quarter, while in the UK, non-European Union trade figures are forecast to show another slim narrowing of the deficit. MP Nick Budgen' private member's bill seeking greater autonomy for the Bank of England gets a second reading. France produces its visible trade balance figures for November. In October, there was an impressive FFr8.7bn surplus, with the recession producing a large fall in imports. Much the same picture is expected for November.</p>

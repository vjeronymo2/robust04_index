			<p><P> July 22, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PHOTOGRAPHY: AFRICAN SAFARIS CHALLENGE THE ABILITY TO PREPARE  </P> <P> Almost everyone likes to take photographs of animals, but after awhile they do  start to look the same. After all, how many pictures can you get of a bear  waving as the tour bus goes by?  </P> <P> If this is the case, you may be ready for the next plateau -- an African  safari.  </P> <P> The price -- $2,500 to $4,000 -- may be an obstacle for most, but the adventure  behind it is certainly appealing.  </P> <P> Those who decide to take an African safari should know that shooting Kodachrome  slides of elephants and lions in their natural habitats can't be done well  without proper advance planning and research.  </P> <P> "Most people think that going to Africa is like going to the San Diego Zoo,"  said Bob Greenburg, a nature photographer and Newport Beach  obstetrician-gynecologist who is planning his fifth trip to Africa.  </P> <P> "It is totally a misconception because wild animals are unique. They are alert,  alive, they have personality, they look at you and they interact with you.  Animals that are in a zoo, like any captive creature, have their spirit broken  and are nervous and circle their cages.  </P> <P> "African animals in the wild have to be alert because if they're not, they're  lunch."  </P> <P> Here are a few of Greenburg's recommendations for a successful safari:  </P> <P> Selecting a tour -- The best tour operator is one who comes recommended by a  friend or someone that has been on a recent safari. Don't be misled by  brochures making grandiose claims. Some of the better operators may be a little  more expensive, but the extra money will probably greatly increase your  comfort.  </P> <P> You should find out how many people will be in each van. The tour companies  usually have mini-vans that seat nine people, which, with luggage, can be a  tight fit. The maximum should be four or five.  </P> <P> Professional photographers leading the tour -- If there is a professional  photographer leading the trip, check his or her references. You will be paying  for his trip to Africa, so he can take photographs to fill his stock files. Be  sure the references are from a recent trip. Ask if the photographer caters to  both beginning and advanced shooters. The photographer should help you with  your pictures so when you come home the results are worthy of your investment  in the trip.  </P> <P> Equipment -- For the average traveler, Greenburg recommends a wide-angle lens,  28- or 35-millimeter up to a telephoto lens of 300-mm. at the minimum. For  animal photography, a 400-mm. lens is best.  </P> <P> A bean bag or a Steady Bag is a great way of steadying the camera and lens on  the van. Trying to use a tripod while shooting through the roof of the van  becomes awkward.  </P> <P> Those who don't wish to carry a Steady Bag should take an empty bean bag with  them and at the first market fill it with dried rice, beans or peas and use it  as a camera support. After the safari give the rice or beans to your driver.  Food is very expensive and will be appreciated.  </P> <P> Always take an extra camera body along. The African dust can ruin the moving  parts of your camera.  </P> <P> Film -- Double the amount of film you originally plan to take. Greenburg shoots  mostly Kodak's Kodachrome 64-slide film. He also shoots a lesser amount of  Kodachrome 200 for low-light situations. He takes the film out of the box, puts  it into a sealed plastic bag and has it hand-examined at the airports, making  sure it is not put through X-rays.  </P> <P> It's important to pace yourself. A rule of thumb is four rolls of 36 exposures  a day when shooting in the national parks. Greenburg says he has shot up to 25  rolls in one day at a lodge where a herd of elephants was approaching the water  hole.  </P> <P> Accommodations -- Tour operators offer accommodations ranging from very nice  lodges at the national parks with all the comforts to tents.  </P> <P> Mosquitoes -- They are probably the only insects you'll have to worry about.  Most of the camps and lodges at night provide mosquito protection and spray the  rooms at sundown.  </P> <P> Medicine -- Greenburg recommends taking protective products for the eyes and  lips. You may also need medication for sore throats, sunburn and scrapes.  </P> <P> Reservations -- Reservations should be made at least six months in advance.  </P> <P> Mornings -- You usually wake up at 5:30 a.m. and have coffee at 6 a.m. You then  drive to the game preserves until 8:30 a.m., stopping when you see animals.  </P> <P> The Safari -- In game parks it's a law that you have to stay in the vans.  Animals view you as no threat when you're in a van. The drivers are specially  trained for these situations. Some of the game lodges offer bunkers or verandas  from which to shoot. They can give you a different perspective.  </P> <P> Shooting Photographs -- The experience of shooting pictures is phenomenal. It's  an unbelievable feeling when you look through your camera at a lion roaring in  your face. Using a fast shutter speed such as 1/250 or faster can greatly  improve your nature shots. Also try to shoot a highlight in the animal's eye,  which can make a photograph come to life. Without this, the animal might as  well be stuffed in a museum.  </P> <P> Also drape a focusing cloth over your head and the camera to enhance your  ability to focus accurately in the bright sunlight.  </P> <P> Don't overextend yourself, because fatigue can make you rush your photographs  and cause you to get careless with focus and composition. Select a tour with  fewer parks so you'll be able to get more detail at each stop. Remember,  patience is a virtue while on safari.  </P> <P> Natives -- Try to establish a rapport with people you want to photograph.  Introduce yourself and ask their names. Don't just stick a camera in their face  and start snapping. Many times the natives will ask to have a photograph sent  back to them. Rarely do people ever keep their promise. So, Greenburg takes  along a Polaroid camera and just gives them that picture.  </P> <P> Music -- Most of the gift shops at the lodges sell recorded music of the local  tribes. Consider buying a cassette for background music for your slide show  when you return.  </P> <P> Recommendations -- Greenburg's favorite park is Mountain Lodge at Mount Kenya  National Park in Kenya. It's an opportunity to be in a beautiful rustic  building overlooking a water hole and salt lick.  </P> <P> It has an underground viewing bunker or you can shoot from the balcony of your  room or the roof of the hotel. It also has some rarely seen animals such as  bush pigs and giant forest hogs in addition to elephants, cape buffalo,  antelope and gazelles.  </P> <P> Another favorite is the Mara Serena Lodge at Masai Mara National Park in Kenya.  It was built as a replica of a Masai tribe's village, but with all the  amenities of a resort.  </P></p>

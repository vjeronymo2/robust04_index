			<p><P> August 3, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> MORE MONEY ASKED FOR INDIGENT CARE  </P> <P> After nine months of grappling with major issues in health care, a county task  force suggested some solutions this week, including more money for community  clinics.  </P> <P> Some of the issues in improving access of the poor to medical care must be  resolved in Orange County, others in Sacramento, said state Sen. Marian  Bergeson (R-Newport Beach), who organized and chaired the Orange County  Coalition for Health Care Solutions.  </P> <P> Bergeson noted that the recommendations "represent a majority opinion of the  members -- not necessarily a complete consensus." The 16-member group's  suggestions included:  </P> <P> * Asking the Board of Supervisors to provide more money to local community  clinics and consider "initiating county-operated clinics" to serve the poor.  Currently, the county provides prenatal care and health screenings for children  but does not offer general medical service to the poor.  </P> <P> * Encouraging arrangements between obstetricians, prenatal clinics and  hospitals for prenatal care for indigent women. Hospitals that accept Medi-Cal  are deluged with poor women at time of delivery who have had no prenatal care.  </P> <P> * Having Orange County declared an "open area" in the Medi-Cal system. Such a  procedure would scrap the current method in which some local hospitals sign  state contracts, agreeing to take indigent patients at a discounted rate.  Instead, every local hospital would take some poor patients.  </P> <P> The task force, whose vice chairman was Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez, included  an unusual mix of private and public leaders, some of whom had never met. They  included hospital administrators, doctors, health care advocate Ellen Severoni,  county Health Care Agency director Tom Uram and Clifford Allenby, secretary of  California's Health and Welfare Agency. The task force is to continue this year  as an advisory body to county supervisors. LANIE JONES  </P></p>

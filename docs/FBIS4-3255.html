			<p>BFN       [Editorial report] Lisbon RDP Antena 1 Radio Network in  Portuguese at 1732 GMT on 17 April carries a 28-minute recording  of an interview with Portuguese Prime Minister Cavaco Silva  conducted in Macao earlier in the day by Teledifusao de Macao  [TDM]. The interviewers are TDM's Mario Rui de Castro, Fatima  Cid, and by an unidentified local journalist.    Asked to comment on criticism levelled at him by the weekly  EXPRESSO and by the secretary of the Portuguese Episcopal  Conference for not speaking about human rights during his visit  to China, Cavaco Silva says: "Portugal, in terms of human  rights, has the same stance as the remaining 11 European Union  [EU] countries. There is no difference. In 1992 I had the  opportunity to speak with the Chinese prime minister about this  matter. And I did so once again in Beijing. It was very clear  that Portugal has a different position, interpretation, emphasis  -- as the Chinese say -- when it comes to human rights. I  believe this matter should not be discussed in public because if  it is, it will not be effective, therefore those who made such  statements in Portugal regarding my visit did so through  ignorance because they were not at the meeting and they do not  know what I told the Chinese leaders."    In connection with this question, the prime minister goes  on:  "I would like to add that it was I, myself, personally, who in  the last few days, almost in the last few hours, negotiated with  the Chinese authorities the possibility of the church of Macao  maintaining relations with religious organizations outside  Macao. With a view to preserving, obviously, relations between  the church of Macao and the Vatican."    The prime minister is then questioned about the matter of  the  nationality of the people of Macao. He says: "Those with  Portuguese passports are Portuguese now and in the future.  Portugal will not withdraw anyone's nationality. However I  knew that there was some concern regarding the implementation of  the Chinese nationality law in the future here in Macao and  therefore I broached this subject with the Chinese authorities.  The answer I was given by the Chinese leaders was that they do  not intend to impose Chinese nationality on Macanese people of  Portuguese descent."    When asked about the future of civil servants in Macao,  Cavaco Silva says: "It is essential for Macao that its special  characteristics and identity remain after 1999, that Macao's  character goes beyond the end of the Portuguese administration.  An important contribution to this can be made from those  working in the public sector. Therefore I believe it is in  Macao's interest, and I stress in Macao's interest, that the  current civil servants remain so after 1999 and nothing should  be done against this principle. It would be a terrible mistake  for Macao and even for Portugal if we were to create the  conditions for all the civil servants to leave Macao."    Later in the interview, Cavaco Silva speaks of the changes  in  China, saying: "I have noticed a significant change in China  regarding the economy. I believe it is difficult to describe  what is happening in China today. I said yesterday and I say it  again, the whole country looks like a construction site, with a  thirst for economic development and growth which I believe does  not exist anywhere else in the world. It would be a mistake for  Portugal and for the EU to ignore one of the largest world  markets in the very near future."    He is then asked for his opinion on whether the British are  defending the interests of Hong Kong in their dealings with  China. Cavaco Silva replies: "I think it is not up to the  Portuguese prime minister to comment on the Hong Kong transition  process. I answer for the Macao transition process."    Returning to the subject of the Chinese economy, he says:  "It appears to me that there is virtually total flexibility and  economic openness. The Chinese authorities say this is the  appropriate way to eliminate the poverty which still exists in  China. I was amazed. It is difficult to imagine before coming  here what is happening in the Chinese economy. I believe that  China will be an economic power in the 21st century if the  current rate of development is maintained. No one in the world  will be able to ignore China. I have been saying for a long  time that it would be a mistake for the western world, the EU,  the United States to ignore a country with 1.2 billion people  and which is fundamental for world stability and peace."    Asked to confirm that he advocates openness by the EU to  China, Cavaco says that "all economic restrictions have  disappeared, all financial restrictions. There are no  restrictions on visits by prime ministers, so it does not make  sense to maintain restrictions on visits by heads of state. I  would describe this as hypocrisy by Europe, so let us put an end  to it and let us fully normalize relations between the EU and  China."    Cavaco Silva goes on to confirm that the Chinese authorities  expressed the wish to have President Soares visit China. Later  he confirms that the Chinese have acknowledged the importance of  a Portuguese cultural presence, of the Portuguese language, in  Macao. He adds that it was important for more Portuguese to  speak Chinese, and he regrets the fact that so few people speak  Portuguese in Macao. "I would like the inter-penetration of  cultures to be more visible with regard to language -- with  Chinese speaking Portuguese and Portuguese speaking Chinese."    Questioned about the Portuguese Government's commitment to  joint ventures between Macao, Portugal, and China, Cavaco Silva  says that although the government backs these, "the Portuguese  Government cannot be too much of an umbrella for Portuguese  businessmen. We want them to have initiative and innovation,  and to take risks. But in this case we have decided to provide  special help. In May another business delegation will visit  China, Macao, and Guangzhou. Obviously, these will be private  initiatives. The Portuguese Government is not going to lead  businessmen by the hand -- they will have to act and show their  ability. You have to struggle here -- it has not all been done,  things have to be built. I hope they will not give up easily.  It would be a mistake if, after the political welcome which was  reflected onto the economic side, our businessmen do not insist  on being present here in Macao, Guangzhou, Zhejiang, Shanghai,  and Beijing."    He continues: "I have great confidence in the future, that  is why I brought to Macao a message of confidence in the future,  and this is what I asked the Chinese authorities to support.  The message from Beijing to Macao was clearly one of confidence  in the future."    Cavaco Silva then speaks of TAP-Air Portugal's plan to  integrate Air Macao: "The government will help, things are  going well. I cannot give details but I can say that the  negotiations saw some progress in Beijing." When asked if Air  Macao would have Portuguese investment, he says that "the signs  point to that, but first we need to have the airport. I have  not seen the airport so I don't want to talk about this yet."  He goes on to say that he believes that the airport would be  positive for Portugal because "it is the missing link to the  outside world for Macao. Macao will gain autonomy and a special  link with Europe and Portugal. That is why I said here in China  that we want and offer Portugal as a platform for China's, and  in particular Macao's, penetration in the EU."    Asked about the Portuguese economy, Cavaco Silva expresses  his belief that a recovery is under way; he is confident that  the inflation rate will stand at 5 percent, between 5 and 6  percent.    The prime minister goes on to reiterate that Macao should  come under the government's jurisdiction. "I think that more  than ever the question of Macao is a foreign policy issue and as  1999 draws near the foreign policy aspect tends to surface. It  is more a question of negotiating with China about the future of  Macao and about the Portuguese presence in Macao, than a  question of resolving administrative matters."    In conclusion, he leaves a message for the Portuguese and  Chinese who live in Macao. "My message is one of confidence in  the future. I believe there are reasons -- especially after the  talks in Beijing with the Chinese authorities and after  observing the evolution in the implementation of the Joint  Declaration during the last seven years -- I believe that are  reasons to think that Macao will continue to enjoy stability,  which is important, will continue to enjoy a strong economic  growth, and will continue to enjoy progress."</p>

			<p><P> June 1, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOTOR RACING;  </P> <P> SAM ERMOLENKO PUTS ACCIDENT BEHIND HIM, GETS BACK ON HIS BIKE  </P> <P> Sam Ermolenko, America's leading speedway motorcycle racer since 1985, has not  ridden seriously since an accident last July 17 nearly ended his career. But he  hopes experience and guile will see him through Saturday night in the American  Speedway Final at Long Beach Veterans Stadium.  </P> <P> The race is the first qualifying round for the 1990 World Finals for riders  from the United States and Canada. Ermolenko, 29, has won it three years in a  row.  </P> <P> But Sudden Sam fell during the world long-track championships last summer at  Herxheim, West Germany, and was hit by a trailing motorcycle. The impact broke  his leg in three places, and surgeons worked seven hours piecing it back  together. He was hospitalized for four weeks.  </P> <P> "I still don't have any idea how it happened," Ermolenko said this week while  relaxing at his mother's home in Cypress. "I was riding up front when something  happened in the third turn, and I went down and was hit by another rider. I  don't know what caused the whole thing, and it's not really been my main  concern to find out.  </P> <P> "I'm more interested in being able to ride Saturday night. I'm not 100%, but  I'm feeling OK and I think I can put it all together for one night. I know what  has to be done and I've been training my mind to do it."  </P> <P> Ermolenko tested the ailing leg last week in races at San Bernardino, where he  finished second in the main event, and at Ascot, where he fell in a heat.  </P> <P> "I wasn't really into the races," he said. "I was more interested in finding  out how I felt getting out of the gate. That's the important thing at Long  Beach, the start. When I fell at Ascot, it was because I was pretty tired and  my leg was sore from riding two nights in a row. It takes me a long time to  warm up because of the muscle damage, and there were some long delays at Ascot.  That hurt me, too.  </P> <P> "It will be easier on me at Long Beach because of the longer turns, where there  won't be as much force on my leg."  </P> <P> Twenty riders will compete Saturday night, and only four will advance to the  Overseas Final in Coventry, England, on June 24. From there, the path goes to  the Intercontinentel Final at Fjeldsted, Denmark, on Aug. 12 and the World  Final at Bradford, England, on Sept. 1.  </P> <P> "The American Final is the hardest single competition in the world," Ermolenko  said. "There are nine guys here capable of riding in the World Finals, and only  four of them will get a chance."  </P> <P> Six of the 20 have been riding this season in the British Speedway League,  which should give them an advantage on the 380-yard Long Beach track. The six  are Ronnie Correy of Fullerton, Greg Hancock of Costa Mesa, Rick Miller of  Reseda, Billy Hamill of Monrovia and the Moran brothers, Shawn of Apple Valley  and Kelly of Glendora.  </P> <P> Correy, a teammate of Ermolenko's on the Wolverhampton Wolves, has been  challenging world champion Hans Nielsen of Denmark for the individual points  lead in the British League this season and was the only American in the World  Final last year.  </P> <P> "Riding in England is a big advantage coming into a race like this," Ermolenko  said. "The weekly tracks in Southern California are so small that the riders  don't have much opportunity to adjust to the longer international-sized ovals.  They are only on the Long Beach track twice a year, and that doesn't give much  time to get the right setup on their bikes."  </P> <P> Stateside favorites who will be contesting for the four berths include national  champion Bobby Schwartz of Costa Mesa, Lance King of Fountain Valley, Mike  Faria of Riverside, Brad Oxley of San Clemente, Steve Lucero of Riverside and  Robert Pfetzing of Santa Ana.  </P> <P> Ermolenko, who lives eight months a year in Hatton, England, was released by  doctors to ride only two weeks ago. Because of his condition and his record,  Ermolenko appealed to the American Motorcyclist Assn. to be seeded into the  Overseas Final, but the appeal was rejected.  </P> <P> "The AMA said it might set a precedent, which they didn't want to do, but I  appealed on the grounds that I'd won three in a row and had the best record in  the World Finals since Bruce Penhall."  </P> <P> Penhall won the world title in 1981 and '82. Ermolenko tied for first place in  1985 but lost in a three-way runoff to Danish riders Erik Gundersen and  Nielsen. In 1987, he was in a runoff for second place but lost to Gundersen  again, as Nielsen won. He was sixth in 1986 and fourth in '88.  </P> <P> Last year, Ermolenko won the American Final and the Overseas Final but never  made it to the World Finals because of his crash.  </P> <P> Saturday's 20-race program will start at 8 p.m.  </P> <P> SPRINT CARS -- Ron Shuman, the defending California Racing Assn. champion who  did not have a victory in the first 10 races, has won two main events in a row  at Ascot Park and is in contention for a third consecutive championship. John  Redican still leads, but Shuman has moved into fourth place behind Redican,  former champion Brad Noffsinger, who won Sunday at Tucson, and Rip Williams.  All will be in Saturday night's 30-lap Ascot main event. . . . Saturday will be  Antique Race Car and Old-timers' Night, featuring cars and drivers from the  Western Racing Assn. era between 1930 and '50. Former Indy 500 and midget  racing champion Sam Hanks is expected to attend with his No. 5 midget, along  with two other 500 winners, Rodger Ward and Parnelli Jones.  </P> <P> SPEEDWAY BIKES -- Bitter rivals Bobby Schwartz and Steve Lucero will continue  their feud tonight at Costa Mesa, where sidecars will also run.  </P> <P> STOCK CARS -- Marcus Mallett, bidding to become the first black driver to win a  track championship at Ascot Park, will try for his fourth victory of the season  in Sunday night's pro stock feature of the Winston Racing Series. Mallett held  off John Kocsis last Monday night for his third victory and took a 32-point  lead over Chris Laney, with Kocsis two points further back. . . . Sportsman,  street stocks and mini stocks will compete Saturday night at both Saugus  Speedway and Cajon Speedway. . . . Dirt cars will run Saturday night at Santa  Maria Speedway.  </P> <P> DRAG RACING -- Spinal surgery for paralyzed racer Darrell Gwynn has been  postponed while doctors treat an infection and high fever in Miami. The six- to  eight-hour operation, which had been planned for Wednesday, will not take place  until next week, according to a spokesperson from the Miami Project to Cure  Paralysis. Frank Hawley will drive Gwynn's top fuel car for the remainder of  the season. . . . Top Gas West will hold a meet Saturday at the Los Angeles  County Raceway in Palmdale.  </P></p>

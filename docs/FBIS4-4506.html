			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By John McBeth in Jakarta] </F>   [Text] Nearly 18 months after influential Research and  Technology Minister B.J. Habibie bought much of the East German  navy in a post-Cold War garage sale, the ships have begun  arriving at a Surabaya naval base. But Indonesia's Defence  Ministry insists it still doesn't know what the final price tag  will be for the ships or what happened to the extras that were  initially included in the package.    Typically, the answers appear to lie at the office door of  Habibie, whose involvement in defence procurement goes back to  1980 when he convinced President Suharto that nurturing a set of  strategic industries with a high technological component was  crucial to accelerating and sustaining Indonesia's  industrialisation process. A key part of the plan was to turn  the navy and air force into a captive market for the state-owned  PT PAL shipyard and aircraft-maker, Industri Pesawat Terbang  Nusantara (IPTN).    Over the past two or three years, Habibie has gone one step  further and secured the final say in the purchase of almost all  major armaments. Leaving aside the loss of lucrative  commissions that once ended up in armed forces' coffers, the  heavy role played by the civilian Habibie in military  procurement has rubbed many an Indonesian general, admiral and  air marshal the wrong way. Says one analyst: "If you're trying  to develop a force structure and you're always being told to buy  this or that, then you'll always be having to rationalise what  that structure is going to be."    The difficult relationship between Habibie and members of  the  military leadership has taken on new relevance in recent years:  Habibie's political influence has been rising at the same time  as some of the military's most influential political figures  have been effectively sidelined. Habibie was appointed in 1990  to lead the Association of Muslim Intellectuals (ICMI), an  Islamic revivalist group.    Many senior officers see the ICMI as a potentially dangerous  counterweight to their own influence and a vehicle which could  be used to support a possible Habibie bid for the presidency  when Suharto, his life-long acquaintance and mentor, finally  leaves the scene. In the past 12 months, Habibie has acquired  valuable political experience by playing an important  behind-the-scenes role at the assembly which extended Suharto's  term as president and at the five-yearly congress of the ruling  party Golkar.    While Habibie has upset military leaders numerous times over  one issue or another, the purchase of East German warships  initially had the support of both then-Defence Minister Benny  Murdani and navy chief Adm. Muhammad Arifin. The two men soured  on the deal, however, in the final months before it was  consummated.    Acquired from the Germans for only US$12.7 million -- but  carrying an initial refurbishment estimate of US$640 million --  the 16 Parchim-class corvettes, 14 Frosch-class landing ship  tanks (LST) and nine Kondor-class minesweepers are trickling  into Surabaya under a delivery schedule that will extend into  next year. Four of the corvettes, one LST and all of the  minesweepers have arrived so far.    A senior Defence Ministry source said the cost of the refits  "will depend on the components to be put in by Habibie," but he  indicated the final figure could be as much as US$200 million  below the original estimate. Savings have been made by limiting  the work done in Germany's Peenewerft (corvettes) and  Neptunwerft (LSTs) shipyards, where labour costs are higher.    The source also sought to play down navy unhappiness over  the  purchase. "The conflict is between the Ministry of Finance and  Habibie," he told the REVIEW. "Of course, if the total budget  is amortised through our defence budget, then there will be a  problem." This stems in part from the actual side of the Defence  Department's annual budgetary allocation which, at Rps [rupiahs]  1.1 trillion (US$511 million) works out at only 1.5 percent of  GDP -- the lowest in the Asean region.    Defence officials say the navy will pay for the ship  refurbishment on an installment basis, starting with the 1995-96  budget. They describe Habibie's initial estimates as "planning  figures" and say they have been kept in the dark about the  status of the additional US$338 million he sought to tack on to  the package for the upgrade of navy shipyards a new port at  Teluk Ratai on Sumatra's southern tip, and two new tankers.    Some military observers point to the fact that the average  cost of US$20 million per ship is small compared with prevailing  market prices. But others are sceptical about the long-term  prognosis for a military already over-burdened with different  systems. The critics also note that while the deal may provide  PAL and its recently expanded facilities with much needed work,  it offers virtually nothing in terms of new technology.    The 1,200-tonne corvettes are a major acquisition for a  small  navy built around 16 Dutch, United States and British-built  frigates, nine fast patrol craft and two attack submarines.  Similar to the Russian Petya or Risha-class patrol vessels, the  corvettes carry twin, 57-millimetre and 30-millimetre guns, four  torpedo tubes, two antisubmarine mortars and two SA-N5  surface-to-air missile launchers.    The major problem for Indonesian naval officers is that  each corvette has three engines and a propulsion system they  have never worked with before -- and for which they have had to  buy all available spare parts. The minesweepers, delivered last  October, are in poor shape and most probably will serve out  their life on coastal patrol duties.    The 1,950-tonne LSTs may be the best buy for a navy with an  important role in nation-building. During any one year, the  navy is required to show the flag at all of the country's 165  ports. Much of that duty falls to the fleet's 30 assorted  landing ships, cargo vessels and coastal oilers which are used  to supply outlying islands and to move gear for civic action and  public works projects.    While Arifin, the navy's top officer, initially went along  with the deal, the same sentiments were apparently not shared by  other senior officers, among them current navy chief Adm. Tonto  Kuswanto, the then-commander of the Eastern Fleet. And even  proponents of the deal had a change of mind when it became  apparent how much would have to be spent on the refurbishments  and on Habibie's list of extras.    "In the end, they were all told it was a done deal and to  shut up and make it work, says one military source. "Navy  chiefs look at it askance. They're going to use the ships, but  they think they've been `had' by Habibie because they weren't  really involved." Said another source: "They don't like what  happened and they don't like the expense, but they do need the  ships to protect Indonesia's outer extremities."    More than any of the three services, the navy seems to have  been the most put out by Habibie's schemes. In 1984, for  example, PAL was given the job of repairing 18 navy ships. When  the shipyard said it would be unable to handle one of the  vessels -- an LST requiring a new engine and communications gear  -- it gave the Defence Ministry the go-ahead to get the vessel  repaired in Singapore instead.    Former officers say the LST was halfway through the refit in  Singapore when Habibie complained to Suharto that the navy was  not utilising PAL. Although it would have cost US$450,000 to  break the contract, a furious Murdani, then armed forces chief,  ordered the cancellation of the whole project. Suharto  subsequently rescinded the order because of the advanced stage  of the refit, but Habibie made few friends out of the episode.    In the mid-1980s Habibie may have learned a costly lesson  about market research when he sought to parlay the purchase of  six high-speed hydrofoils into a deal with Boeing to build as  many as 100 of the 40-knot craft under licence at PAL. The plan  fell through when the navy refused to have anything to do with  them because of their high fuel consumption and problems posed  by the unusual amount of flotsam in Indonesian waters.    Two of the hydrofoils were later bought by a privately  owned,  passenger-ferry operation, but the other four gathered rust at  PAL until late last year when the navy finally agreed to take  them on to their books for troop-carrying and search and rescue  work. One in fact has recently been seen around the disputed  Sipadan and Ligitan islands, located just off the east coast of  Borneo island.    Navy relations with Habibie reached such a low ebb in 1986  that the fleet air arm embarked on a programme known as  "Turbo-express" to re-engine and lengthen its five ageing C47  transport planes rather than replace them with new IPTN-built  CN235 turboprops. "That is an indication," says one source, "of  the lengths they were prepared to go to avoid being a captive  audience for Habibie."    As concurrent head of the Agency for Strategic Industries  (BPIS), which groups together, PAL, IPTN and eight other  concerns, Habibie supervised the early 1980s decision to buy  100,000 Belgian FNC assault rifles which, along with the  U.S.-made M16 and the Russian AK47, is one of three standard  infantry weapons now spread through vanous units of the  271,000-strong Indonesian armed forces.    Under a seven-year, transfer-of-technology arrangement, the  first 25,000 rifles were to be made in Belgium and the last  5,000 at PT Pindad, a munitions manufacturing company under the  BPIS umbrella. But sources intimately involved with the deal  claim that after four years, when army inspectors began looking  into the transfer of the assembly line, they discovered far too  much had been paid for the initial batch of rifles.    In the mid-1980s, Habibie caused further consternation by  proposing to establish a factory for British Scorpion light  tanks. At the time the plan was mooted, it was already clear  there would not be a regional market for the vehicles.  Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and New Zealand had  bought Scorpions, or as many as they were going to -- and almost  a decade later, manufacturer Avis is still actively trying to  sell the tank to the Indonesian army.</p>

			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Japan monopoly body orders end to building cartel JAPAN'S anti-monopoly Fair Trade Commission has ordered 166 construction and related companies to disband the largest bid-rigging cartel uncovered by the agency in its attempts to clean up the country's construction industry. The surveying, consultancy and construction companies are alleged by the FTC to have routinely rigged bids for contracts in the Nagoya area, in central Japan, by convening a meeting two days before a bid closing date. Commission officials said that the companies would decide among themselves which would apply for the contract and, if more than one company was keen, they would conduct a lottery. In the bidding process, the chosen company would bid lowest and inevitably win the contract. These cartels, or dango, are a serious point of trade friction between Japan and the US, which is attempting to improve access to the Japanese market for US contractors. Until this case, the largest dango was in Saitama, near Tokyo, where 66 companies had divided local government projects among themselves until this year. The FTC closed down the cartel, and the Ministry of Construction warned the companies not to renew their collusion. The 166 companies have until July 23 to notify the FTC of their willingness to disband the cartel. If they refuse, the commission could decide to take legal action, which would be the first formal anti-monopoly case against the politically-influential construction industry.</p>

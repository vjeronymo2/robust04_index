			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Indonesian aircraft rolls out Indonesia's first aircraft to be designed and assembled by the country's state-owned aircraft maker, PT Industry Pesawat Terbang Nusantara, was rolled out yesterday in an elaborate ceremony presided over by President Suharto. Development of the N-250, a 70-seater turboprop aircraft 10 years in the making, has been criticised by the World Bank which says the Indonesian government would do better to invest its money in industries where profitable returns are more certain. There are concerns that it will be difficult to sell the N-250 - a pet project of Mr B J Habibie, Indonesia's minister for research and technology  -on the international market where it will compete with the models and services of long-established turboprop aircraft makers. However, Mr Habibie said yesterday that IPTN, in which Dollars 950m (Pounds 580m) has been invested over the past 18 years, had signed a letter of intent with Gulfstream International Airline of the US for an order of four N-250s and an option on six more. Press reports earlier this year said FFV, a Swedish leasing company, signed a memorandum of understanding with IPTN for the purchase of 24 N-250s for delivery in early 1996. In addition, three domestic carriers, Sempati Air, Merpati Air and Bouraq Airlines, yesterday ordered 16 N-250s with an option to order a further 162. Mr Habibie said he was looking for a US location to set up an assembly plant for the aircraft and said General Electric of the US had agreed to take a 10 per cent equity stake in IPTN's US venture. Mr Habibie also said he was talking to Boeing, which was considering taking an equity stake in the planned US plant. The plant would be 40 per cent owned by IPTN and is expected to make its first delivery of a US-assembled Indonesian-designed aircraft in the second half of 1998.</p>

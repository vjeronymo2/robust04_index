			<p>BFN     [Text] The cabinet committee investigating the implication  of the KwaZulu land issue says it hopes to submit its report and  recommendations to the cabinet by the 14th of next month.    The minister of land affairs, Mr. Derek Hanekom, said  experts  had been appointed to assist the committee. He said that over  three million hectares of the former homeland had been  transferred to the control of the Zulu king. The transfer of  the land took place just before the election without any media  coverage.</p>

			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Survey of the Philippines (5): Doubts over democracy - The Military SIX YEARS ago a failed military coup triggered the popular uprising that brought President Corazon Aquino to power, ending 14 years of army-backed Marcos dictatorship. Seven attempted coups later it is clear that disgruntled sections of the army have not lost their taste for intervening in civilian government. While none of the coups has succeeded, the durability of the democratic institutions which President Aquino restored is still in doubt as national elections loom in May. Mrs Aquino has constantly had to look over her shoulder at a section of her military that sneers at civilian supremacy. Many of the officers with political ambitions look longingly at Thailand where the generals rule. But apart from their shared taste for intervention, similarities between the two countries are minimal. Thai generals go out of their way not to disrupt business. The Philippines rebels in the 1989 coup, however, seized and shot up hotels and offices in Manila's business district, stopping the country's faltering economic recovery dead in its tracks. There are some signs that the dissenters in the army are becoming less influential under General Lisandro Abadia, Chief of Staff of the armed forces. But it could take years before the military can be guaranteed to stay in their barracks at times of political tension. 'Marcos established a constitutional coup with the support of the military,' says General Rafael Ileto, National Security Adviser to the President, referring to the declaration of Martial Law in 1972. Then Mrs Aquino came to power in the aftermath of a bungled military coup against Marcos. 'The military have got used to coups,' says Gen Ileto. Perhaps the most important change since the 1989 coup is that financial and political support for the leading renegade officer, Colonel Gregorio 'Gringo' Honasan, appears to have dwindled. The army believes that a dozen rebel officers, including Honasan, and 100 enlisted men who took part still remain at large. Honasan's organisation - the Reform the Army Movement (RAM) - has also lost much of the credibility it once enjoyed. During the 1989 coup, this junior officers' pressure group that claimed to campaign for professionalism in the army, openly linked with right-wing Marcos rebels in a crude grab for power. To outsiders, the army's leaders still show an astonishing degree of tolerance towards these renegades. Gen Abadia, for example, feels able to describe Honasan as a 'gentleman officer' with whom he can sit and discuss surrender terms, even though the Colonel's troops bombed Mrs Aquino's palace during the last coup. It is only the latest display of army ambivalence towards its rebels. After right-wing Marcos loyalists launched a bizarre coup attempt in 1986 by taking over the Manila Hotel and swearing in a new president, General Fidel Ramos, then chief of staff, ordered the rebels to do press-ups as a punishment. Such is the residual distrust of the army that some observers believe the army might take over if the next president, competing against several other candidates, is elected with only a small minority of the vote. Gen Abadia says intervention is unlikely. Only if there is 'massive fraud or disorder' would the army 'restore order as mandated by the constitution', he says. Ironically, just as military unity appears to be returning, the departure of the US bases from the Philippines might rekindle dissent among the ranks. The issue is money. As part of the bases compensation package, the US pays about Dollars 200m in military assistance for helicopters, signals equipment, weapons and training. As part of the defence cuts as much as the ending of the bases agreement, the US military aid programme is likely to be cut by at least half. This will put enormous additional strains on an already creaking national budget. While the Philippines will continue to receive equipment for several years under this programme, Gen Abadia has said he will be requesting an additional 3bn pesos to fill the gap left by cuts in US aid. If the military does not get the funds, there is a good chance that leaders will claim the army does not have the tools to tackle the Communist-led New People's Army. In fact, the Communist challenge is already dwindling thanks to the collapse of Communist models in eastern Europe and internal divisions among the Communist party leadership. The army reckons numbers under arms have fallen to 11,000 from 16,000 a few years ago. And Gen Abadia is forecasting that by 1993 the army will have crushed the political backbone of the movement and the insurgency will be no more than a policing problem. This might be optimistic. Undoubtedly, current military tactics of combining military and propaganda offensives, are reducing NPA influence, even though the army is still too often linked to killing and torturing of innocent civilians. But the government is still not building enough rural roads, health clinics and local industry to encourage the kind of economic growth on which lasting victory over the NPA must be based. The generals in Manila are critical of the way civilian officials have failed many rural areas and made the army's task more difficult; it is the most convincing of their complaints against Mrs Aquino s administration. But as a result of luck (the collapse of European Communism), restored democracy and Mrs Aquino's residual popularity, the Communists are facing their most testing time. It is a far cry from the last days of martial law when US intelligence reports said Marcos had let the political situation deteriorate so much that 'ultimate defeat and Communist takeover' were on the cards.</p>

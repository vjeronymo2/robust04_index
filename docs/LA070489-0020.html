			<p><P> July 4, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PALMDALE UNPERSUADED BY ACTON'S PLEA ON FIREWORKS  </P> <P> Members of an Acton civic group, citing the potential for forest fires near  their rural community, canvassed fireworks stands in Palmdale during the  weekend in an unsuccessful effort to persuade the businesses to sell fireworks  only to Palmdale residents.  </P> <P> Palmdale is the only city in northern Los Angeles County to allow fireworks  sales. Unfortunately, said Acton resident Charles Brink, some of these  fireworks are purchased by people who take them outside the city. Brink is  chairman of a fledgling civic group that is trying to establish an Acton town  council to address local affairs.  </P> <P> Brink said his group asked the vendors to check the identifications of people  purchasing fireworks. "We're not trying to eliminate all fireworks sales, we're  just trying to restrict them," Brink said Monday. The organizations declined  his request, he said.  </P> <P> The move to restrict fireworks was prompted by unusually dry weather and by an  intermittent water shortage in Acton. Brink said Acton residents want to meet  with fireworks vendors and Palmdale city officials in hopes of clamping down on  fireworks sales by next year.  </P> <P> But Palmdale Mayor William J. Knight said he doubts the public would support  restrictions on fireworks sales. Knight said that many local charities, such as  service clubs and high school athletic teams, maintain that fireworks sales  account for as much as 90% of their annual budgets. Ten organizations obtained  licenses to run fireworks stands in the city this year, according to city  officials.  </P> <P> Knight said Palmdale does not endorse the illegal use of fireworks outside the  city limits. But he also said it is the responsibility of other cities and Los  Angeles County -- not Palmdale -- to police the illegal use of fireworks.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County Fire Department, under contract to Palmdale for fire  service, opposes fireworks and annually urges the city to ban them, Capt.  Ronald Hayton said. Through the years, some City Council members have tried and  failed to win support for a fireworks ban, he said.  </P></p>

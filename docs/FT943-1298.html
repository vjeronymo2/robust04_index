			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Motoring: Honda prepares to take on Europe's best This is the latest Honda Civic, designed and developed in Britain and Germany for European markets and about to go into production at Swindon, Wiltshire, writes Stuart Marshall. It will be unveiled in Paris in two weeks and will put Honda into contention with Europe's mainstream car-makers. At prices between Pounds 11,000 and Pounds 14,000, the Civic will compete with up-market versions of cars like the Ford Escort, Opel/Vauxhall Astra, Peugeot 306 and Volkswagen Golf. All Civics are fitted with power steering, and the top models have enough wood veneer interior trim to make former Jaguar owners feel at home. Four engines - of 1.4 and 1.6-litre capacity - will be offered, two of them with Honda's exclusive VTEC variable valve timing. Every Civic will have twin air-bags - a first in this class of car, according to the Honda company. Automatic transmission and air-conditioning will be extras, although priced reasonably. Sales start next month. A new, Civic-based Rover 200 will be launched early in 1995.</p>

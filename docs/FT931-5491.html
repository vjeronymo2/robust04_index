			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Bilston &amp; Battersea raising Pounds 750,000 BILSTON &amp; Battersea Enamels' decline continued in 1992 with a fall into full-year losses of Pounds 222,000, against profits of Pounds 120,000. The shares closed 4p down at 28p. The first-half improvement in sales was reversed in the second. However, the West Midlands-based company was confident that a new strategy being put in place would enable results to improve. It is making a cash call to raise a net Pounds 753,000 to help finance the plans. The company is issuing 4.22m shares on a 1-for-1 basis at 20p each. Most of the board are not taking up their entitlements, the majority of which are being taken by Mr Roger Foster, chairman and Mr Hugh Gledhill, managing director. Mr Lindsay Bury, or a company controlled by him, will take up the balance and is proposing to sub-underwrite the issue. The result will be that he will control between 10 per cent and 27.5 per cent of the enlarged equity. Turnover for the year was Pounds 3.96m (Pounds 3.99m). The pre-tax loss was after exceptional costs of Pounds 181,000. Losses per share were 4.1p (earnings 2p).</p>

			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Europe's health costs set to soar EUROPE'S health care costs will outstrip both inflation and economic growth over the next five years, according to a study published today. The growing demand for health care will lead to a fundamental restructuring of its provision, according to the survey which questioned more than 2,700 health experts in 10 European countries. The study concludes that public sector health spending will decline as a proportion of total health expenditure in all 10 countries. Private insurance, company schemes and household spending is expected to increase. European governments will need to balance what taxpayers can afford with constant political pressure to provide every citizen with ever-better access to higher quality care. Most will react by increasingly guaranteeing universal access to only a specified minimum level of care. This will mean patients will be obliged to contribute more for treatment and medicines. Simultaneously, governments will implement a range of cost containment strategies. These will include increased use of generic drugs and limited lists of reimbursed medicines, combined with increased contributions from patients for their treatments. Doctors will increasingly be forced to make decisions on the basis of cost. Patients will be moved away from expensive large hospitals to outpatient care, local treatment centres, and their own homes.

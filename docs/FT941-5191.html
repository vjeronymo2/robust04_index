			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / People: Racal chooses Richardson for data Racal Electronics, which has been dogged by bid rumours for months, is attempting to turn around its problem data communications operation by bringing in Martin Richardson, right, from elsewhere in the company to become chairman and chief executive of Racal Data Group. Tim Holley, the previous incumbent, was last October named chief executive of Camelot, one of the bidders for the National Lottery. Since then, Racal's chief executive David Elsbury says he has spent several months 'reviewing and validating the new-product pipeline and sharpening the focus of the research and development programme'. Richardson now has until May to produce for the board 'a detailed report on progress and plans for the business'. While Holley was based in the UK, Richardson has moved out to Florida, where much of the data group's business is located. Holley had spent more of his time on the other, newer, side of the division, the UK-based Network Services. Peter Blair, 56, previously in charge of the company's advanced development activities, has also transferred to Florida as technical director of the data group. Richardson, 49, a former Plessey executive who has been on the main board of Racal Electronics since 1985, earned his spurs recently by repairing the fortunes of Racal's specialised businesses, in particular turning software subsidiary Racal-Redac's large losses into respectable profits. He will have plenty of scope for action at Racal Data Group, where pre-tax profits in the year to March 1993 were just Pounds 12.6m despite sales of Pounds 370m. As Mike Styles, an analyst at Credit Lyonnais Laing puts it: 'Richardson's track record suggests he will (revive the operation). The question is how much time he has got.' Yesterday, the shares closed at 229p, up 7p on the day.</p>

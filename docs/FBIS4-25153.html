			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 6 (AFP)--A technical problem rather  than pilot error is likely to blame for the crash of a China  Northwestern Airlines Tupolev-154, in which 160 were killed,  airline sources and local officials said Tuesday. An airline  spokesman, speaking from the central city of Xian, emphasised  that the pilot "had not committed any mistake" in Monday's crash    The English-language official newspaper China Daily,  meanwhile, reported that three eyewitness said they heard "two  loud explosions in the clouds and then saw a fireball crashing  to the ground."    A spokesman for the government of Shaanxi province said the  two explosions were caused by the "breakup of the flight deck"  but denied there had been a fire. "The aircraft debris and  bodies recovered on the ground bore no scorch marks," he said.    The spokesman said: "It is more likely that it was caused by  a technical problem affecting the plane's structure."    The Tupolev-154 which crashed shortly after takeoff from  Xian  on a flight to Guangzhou, is an old Soviet-designed aircraft  with three turbo-jets.</p>

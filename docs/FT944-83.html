			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / On The Front Line: Carter's peace quest - War and Peace (Warmongers and Peacemakers) / The former president is waging a lone campaign Jimmy Carter is a naval engineer by training and, as such, believes there are few problems not susceptible to a practical resolution. If, apart from the Camp David Middle East accords, his presidency from 1977-81 was unexceptional in its achievements, his life after the White House has demonstrated that the peace-making fire is burning more vigorously than ever. It has been an extraordinary year for this independent-minded one-man moral band. In the summer he was instrumental in defusing a US nuclear confrontation with North Korea; in the autumn he led the US delegation that prevented, in the 59th minute of the 11th hour, a full American military invasion of Haiti; as winter dawned he took on the toughest problem of them all in attempting to stop the fighting in Bosnia. Between 1989 and 1993 he had led international election monitoring teams to five third world countries and helped broker the settlement in Ethiopia that led to the independence of Eritrea. Carter brings to any negotiating table rare talents, uncomfortable as they sometimes are to his own government and to others involved. His intellectual grasp of the minutiae of problems and his dogged persistence in pursuit of the goal of peace are widely admired, yet his independence and his tendency to speak his mind can take him down roads that make both his supporters and his critics cringe. His technique is built on the belief that the intractable may be subject to resolution if warring factions can somehow be assuaged, even if this means discarding past baggage. Thus he was complimentary about Kim Il-sung, the late North Korean dictator, who had never heard a kind American word in 45 years; he commended Lt Gen Raoul Cedras, leader of the Haitian junta that had so oppressed the island nation, as a simple and honourable military man, with a rather attractive wife to boot. Yet on both occasions his public emollience seemed to have helped produce agreements. This month he was so bold as to assure Radovan Karadzic, leader of the Bosnian Serbs, who stand accused, on solid evidence, of ethnic cleansing among other sins, that Americans had received a one-sided picture of the nature of the Balkan conflict. This may be accurate in the literal sense but was hardly politic and, for a man who, as president, had raised high the banner of human rights, it had the appearance of apostasy on a grand scale. Yet, to Carter, the dynamics of the negotiating table may have justified such statements. Nor did he apparently allow the fact that Karadzic might have been using him as a pawn to secure legitimacy for his own regime to get in the way of his pursuit of the overriding goal of a ceasefire and a negotiated settlement. Operating from the Atlanta-based Carter Centre, a combination think-tank and advocacy institute, the former president has a formidable network of contacts independent of the US government. In this year's intercessions, he acted after receiving approaches from North Koreans, Haitians and Bosnian Serbs and not on prior commissions from Washington. Because of this there has been tension between him and the Clinton administration - at one stage over Haiti palpably so with his old friend Warren Christopher, the secretary of state. But this very willingness to take on issues that governments themselves have failed to resolve, allied to the increasing respect in which he is held around the world, makes him impossible to ignore. There are those who spent the 1980s denigrating his presidency who now say, cynically, that he is only in it for personal redemption, and perhaps the Nobel Peace Prize. But this surely misreads the man himself. He left the White House at the age of only 56, sound in body and mind, deeply imbued with Christian beliefs and incapable of spending the rest of his life on the lecturing or golf circuits, as many ex-presidents do. What he has done at home, building low income housing, and in peacemaking abroad has brought him not only new regard from his fellow countrymen as a 'good man' but clearly a revived purpose in life.</p>

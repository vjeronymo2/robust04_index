			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): New Hong Kong high as Japanese stay sidelined INVESTORS remained on the sidelines on uncertainties over a factional row within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and a possible discount rate cut, and the Nikkei average finally closed lower after moving within a narrow range, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei ended 128.48 lower at the day's low of 17,013.04 after share prices lost ground on late futures-related arbitrage selling. Earlier, the day had been punctuated by falls on profit-taking, an afternoon recovery on foreign interest, and index-linked buying by investment trusts which pushed the index up to the day's high of 17,178.54. Volume rose to 210m shares from 168m. Losers outnumbered gainers by 488 to 380, with 218 unchanged, the Topix index of all first section stocks shed 5.06 to 1,293.27 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 2.91 to 1042.36. Traders said that some investors would remain inactive until the US presidential elections in November were over. 'The possible Clinton victory has not been discounted into share prices,' said Mr Ross Purdie at SG Warburg. He added that the currency market would be most affected, and that Japanese investors had not hedged their positions to gain from the outcome. Expectations of lower interest rates buoyed interest rate-sensitive, large-capital issues. Nippon Steel rose Y3 to Y295 and Sumitomo Metal Industries added Y1 to Y271. Dealers again focused on Interferon-related stocks. Inabata gained by its daily limit of Y200 to Y1,370, while Daiichi Pharma-ceutical gained Y60 to Y1,680. Financial issues were weaker on profit taking. Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank fell Y30 to Y1,470 and Mitsubishi Bank lost Y30 to Y2,090. Uni Charm, the diaper maker, surged Y130 to Y1,610. The company projects a 37 per cent rise in annual pre-tax profits for the year to March next year. Nikkiso also gained Y71 to Y620 on a firm earnings forecast. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 71.75 to 18,798.71 in volume of 11.4m shares. Pharmaceutical and machinery shares rose on small-lot buying. Ono Pharmaceutical rose Y100 to Y5,610. Roundup HIGHS in Hong Kong, Malaysia and Thailand enlivened the region yesterday. HONG KONG saw a torrent of institutional demand which took turnover up from HKDollars 4.19bn to HKDollars 6.34bn, just below the record HKDollars 6.42bn set on May 25. The Hang Seng index ended 128.27 or 2.1 per cent higher at 6,329.12. Hutchison Whampoa featured after a report, denied by the company, that it may close down or sell the overseas investments of its telecommunications arm. Hutchison topped the most active list, gaining HKDollars 1.90 to HKDollars 17.80. BANGKOK broke above the 900 mark on the SET index which closed 18.83 or 2.1 per cent higher at a new 18-month high of 902.76 in turnover of Bt15.52bn. The top five active stocks were all banks, and the banking group accounted for 46 per cent of total market turnover led by Krung Thai Bank, which rose Bt10 to Bt238, and Bangkok Bank, up Bt7 to Bt93. KUALA LUMPUR closed at its high for the year on strong buying by both domestic and foreign institutional investors, particularly from Singapore and Hong Kong. The composite index advanced 8.02 to 623.87 as volume rose to 173m shares after Tuesday's 112m. SEOUL closed firmer in active trading as strong buying outweighed surges of profit-taking. The composite index ended 9.26 higher at 568.97 in turnover of Won517.1bn after Won431.9bn. MANILA slid after Philippine Long Distance Telephone fell back in the US. The composite index lost 26.47 to 1,327.68 in combined turnover of some 263m pesos. PLDT fell 25 pesos to 920. AUSTRALIA saw heavy turnover in Foster's rights as the All Ordinaries index rose 4.3 to 1,448.2. Some 100m Foster's rights changed hands at between 14 and 16 cents each and the brewer's shares closed 5 cents higher at ADollars 1.24 in volume of 5.8m shares. Stocks with exposure to Papua New Guinea were calmer: they were affected recently after the government there said it might re-negotiate mining contracts. Placer Pacific and Highlands Gold each rose 1 cent to ADollars 1.75 and 85 cents respectively. NEW ZEALAND, pleased with the successful listing of Natural Gas, a division of Fletcher Challenge, saw the NZSE-40 index gain 7.89 to 1,381.21 in turnover of some NZDollars 26m. Natural Gas, which had an issue price of 90 cents, closed the day at 98 cents, while Fletcher Challenge closed down 4 cents at NZDollars 1.76. BOMBAY recovered on the last day of trading in the Hindu year, the BSE Index peaking at 3,002.16 before 52.63 higher at 2,987.29 after Wednesday's fall of 116.24.</p>

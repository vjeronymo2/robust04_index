			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / International Company News: Power Corp and Axa in Chinese insurance venture Great-West Life, one of Power Corporation of Canada's key subsidiaries, is linking with Axa, a leading French insurer, to establish an insurance arm in China. The Canadian company's move, which could involve investment from a Chinese partner, follows a Chinese government policy change allowing foreign companies into the financial services sector, according to Mr Paul Desmarais, who controls Power Corp. Great-West is one of North America's leading group life and health insurers. Mr Desmarais, who first went to China in 1979 and already has several joint investments with China International Trust &amp; Investment (CITIC), said the government has also asked Power Corp to plan a cable TV system for Beijing. Power Corp is negotiating with several potential international partners to set the system up, he said, but refused to identify them. Power Corp has joint ventures in China in property, electric power and gold exploration (with American Barrick Resources), with international and Chinese partners. It dropped a pulp and paper project two years ago because infrastructure was lacking. Mr Desmarais holds joint control of Pargesa in Europe with the Belgian Frere family. Pargesa controls Petrofina, Tractabel and other European industrial and communications interests. Besides Great-West, he controls Investors Group, Canada's biggest mutual fund (unit trust) distributor, a communications group, 18 per cent of Southam, Canada's biggest newspaper chain, and 1 per cent of Time Warner. Mr Desmarais, speaking after the annual meeting, said Power Corp had cash resources of nearly USDollars 2bn and very little debt. Power Corp's first-quarter profit was CDollars 46.1m (USDollars 33.5m), or 36 cents a share, up 55 per cent from a year earlier, on revenues of CDollars 1.6bn, little changed.</p>

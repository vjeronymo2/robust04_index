			<p><P> December 20, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> STUDIOS, RESIDENTS CLASH OVER BURBANK GROWTH  </P> <P> Burbank homeowners and film studio executives faced off at a Burbank City  Council meeting Tuesday night over proposals to control growth in the city's  Media District.  </P> <P> Studio executives asked the council for more flexibility to develop their  facilities, while homeowners complained that the restrictions on development  contained in the proposed Media District Specific Plan will not adequately  protect their neighborhoods from increased traffic, air pollution and noise.  </P> <P> "People don't want to look out their front windows and see massive high-rises,"  said Ted McConkey, a member of the Burbank Rancho Homeowners. "We're asking  that no building in the Media District be more than five stories in height."  </P> <P> Jack O'Neill, vice president of real estate for NBC, said the studios should be  allowed to build up to 20 stories high.  </P> <P> "The five-story restriction is an extreme position, which I think would just  cut off development completely in the city of Burbank," O'Neill said. "The  studios have a special role and a special economic base in the city and the  Specific Plan should respect that."  </P> <P> More than 100 people attended the meeting, at which the council was to consider  the proposed Media District Specific Plan. When the plan reaches its final  form, after a process that includes revisions, an environmental impact report  and more public hearings, it will guide development in the Media District.  </P> <P> The district, dominated by several motion picture and television studios, is a  1.2-square mile area bordered roughly by the Ventura Freeway, Oak Street,  Keystone Street and Clybourne Avenue.  </P> <P> Studio executives argue that they need to build more office and studio space to  keep up with competitive demands. But homeowners complain that the studio  properties are already overdeveloped.  </P> <P> All the studios that have offices there have said they want to expand their  facilities. The Burbank Studios, which include Warner Bros. and Columbia  Pictures, want to build almost 3.8 million square feet of space. NBC and Walt  Disney each want to build 1.4 million square feet.  </P> <P> For the past three years, Burbank officials have been attempting to formulate a  plan that will accommodate those landowners who want to develop their  properties as well as nearby residents determined to keep noise, traffic and  pollution from overwhelming their neighborhoods.  </P> <P> Included in the proposed Media District Specific Plan is what city officials  say may be one of the strictest building controls in the state. Under that  provision, developers might be allowed to build only one square foot of floor  area for every square foot of property they control.  </P> <P> Height limits on high-rises are also being considered, and developers who want  to build structures more than 35 feet high might have to apply for  conditional-use permits, which would require them to hold public hearings.  </P> <P> The Burbank Rancho Homeowners has also called for developers to be assessed a  special "neighborhood preservation fee" of $1.50 per square foot of office and  commercial space. The money would be used to mitigate increased traffic, noise  and other problems caused by the new development.  </P></p>

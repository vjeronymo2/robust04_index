			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Fears of foreign competition in solar race BRITAIN may eventually earn more than Pounds 700m a year from the export of an advanced form of solar power technology but is in danger of losing out to foreign competitors, a report for the Department of Energy warns, John Hunt writes. Advances in photovoltaics - in which treated glass plates convert sunlight directly into electricity - have led to the possibility of competitive electricity generation using such materials in the cladding and roofing of buildings. Yesterday Mr Colin Moynihan, energy minister, announced that his department was providing Pounds 250,000 for a two-year programme by the department's Energy Technology Support Unit (ETSU). It will assess the potential for photovoltaic (PV) electricity generation in the UK. Mr Michael Harper, Friends of the Earth's renewable energy campaigner, described the sum as 'peanuts' compared with the amounts being spent on PV in some other countries. The report warns that technological advances in PV by foreign companies, with the aid of government support, may make it increasingly difficult for the UK PV companies to compete in international markets.

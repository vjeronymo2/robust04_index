			<p><P> May 5, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HELPING YOUNG PEOPLE LOOK AT 'WHY' OF DEATH;  </P> <P> STAGE: SCR'S YOUNG CONSERVATORY PLAYERS FOCUS ON AGES 10 AND UP, RATHER THAN  THE USUAL MUCH YOUNGER AUDIENCES.  </P> <P> A play for children . . . about death?  </P> <P> The South Coast Repertory Young Conservatory Players, best known for upbeat  adaptations of familiar children's classics, is challenging its actors and  audience alike with Aurand Harris' "The Arkansaw Bear," opening today at the  Orange County Performing Arts Center.  </P> <P> Harris' critically praised play gently traces the stages of emotion felt by the  dying and their survivors through a fantasy odyssey undertaken by Tish, a  little girl whose grandfather is dying, and an aging performing bear. Together  they seek the "why" of death.  </P> <P> "When you get deeper into it, you realize we're doing a play about living,"  said director Diane Doyle, who noted that the work does not touch on specific  religious beliefs. "The little girl is a footprint, part of a cycle; she  carries on."  </P> <P> Doyle promised that the show is not shadows and gloom; it has a circus theme  with clowns, acrobats, a high-wire act, a fairy named Star Bright and the  dancing Bear.  </P> <P> "It's not a scary play," she said. "The message is subtle. It provokes  conversations, opens the door, so the subject doesn't remain undiscussed. It's  not a downer, either; Harris makes us laugh.  </P> <P> "It's so simple. It's just the carrying on of the family, the cherishing of  positive memories."  </P> <P> "The Arkansaw Bear" gives Doyle a chance to fulfill a longtime desire to  provide theater to older audiences, ages 10 and up, rather than the much  younger audiences who are most often targeted by children's theater.  </P> <P> She said what her company is doing "should be called theater for youth, not  children's theater. We want to do plays with words, thoughts and ideas and get  away a little bit from 'color and noise.' Older children (have been) missing  out."  </P> <P> Doyle admitted that there may be some difficulty in building that new audience,  when patrons in the past have felt Players' shows were appropriate for babies  and toddlers.  </P> <P> "We're marketing differently, using an older approach," Doyle said. "You just  grit your teeth and hope that older group comes in."  </P> <P> The cast features eight young people, ages 12 to 17, plus four adults. To  prepare her young actors for the sensitive subject matter, Doyle said: "We had  a lot of discussion before rehearsing; we really had to talk this all out. I  make sure my actors know why they're saying what they're saying."  </P> <P> Michael Miller, 17, a theater arts major at Fullerton College, plays the  World's Greatest Dancing Bear. He was surprised and intrigued by his role.  </P> <P> "In many ways," he said, "the Bear is both the comic relief and the serious  part of the play; one minute he prances around the stage with pretentious  monologues in a bad English accent, the next he's weeping at the feet of Death.  </P> <P> "Tish (played by Christine Farrell) helps him figure out what's happening as  much as he helps her."  </P> <P> Miller was surprised to find how closely he identified with the role. "The  Bear's a lot like me," he said, "because he's always on, always entertaining  everybody. I'm a lot like that in real life, I tend to walk around and make  incredibly bad jokes all the time."  </P> <P> The most difficult part of the role has been playing age, Miller said. "He's an  old bear, and I'm 17. A teen-ager tends to be all over the place -- the Bear  still has a lot of energy, but has to be more subdued. You have to focus more."  </P> <P> Miller relates to the play on a more serious level as well, saying that it  echoes the denial and finally the acceptance he felt at the loss of a close  family friend not long ago. "It's pretty much the process I went through," he  said.  </P> <P>  The South Coast Repertory Young Conservatory Players' production of "The  Arkansaw Bear" is in Founders Hall, Orange County Performing Arts Center, 600  Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa.

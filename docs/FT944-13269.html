			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Views sought on rail access charges Mr John Swift QC, the rail industry regulator, yesterday asked the railway freight industry for its views on how track access charges should be negotiated with Railtrack. He outlined in a consultation document his own proposals to allow the two sides to negotiate commercial rates while at the same time setting limits on charges to companies with no alternative. As part of the privatisation of British Rail train operations and track ownership have been split and train operators pay Railtrack depending on the number and type of trains that they run. In a departure from his earlier proposals for passenger train operators, Mr Swift said there was no clear case for requiring Railtrack to reduce charges to freight operators by a formula based on the retail price index minus a particular figure. Commercial pressures should ensure that Railtrack passed on any cost savings, he said. He proposed a method of calculating appropriate cost 'floors' and price ceilings which would allow Railtrack to cover its costs but not penalise customers. 'Railtrack's current approach to calculating ceilings may not provide users with adequate protection against excessive charges,' he warned. The regulator said he would require Railtrack to publish more information about its freight business so that he could see whether his guidance had been followed. Responses to the consultation document are required by November 25. Framework for the Approval of Railtrack's Track Access Charges for Freight Services.

			<p><P> August 10, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ROE RETURNS TO TAKE LEAD FOR LO-TEC  </P> <P> Three's Company co-founder Betzi Roe has made it her mission to collect modern  dance solos by talented yet underexposed choreographers. The style and artistic  focus among them varies considerably, but all of the dance makers have two  things in common.  </P> <P> "They're all women, and they all work in California," Roe said. "I felt  California women were making good work that doesn't get seen much. And I  thought (their dances) would make a good journey through the contemporary  woman's perspective."  </P> <P> Roe has performed this potpourri -- called "California Women Dancing" -- during  myriad guest appearances throughout the country. The dances have even been seen  in the Soviet Union, where Roe made historic inroads three years ago as the  first U.S. State Department "cultural specialist" in modern dance.  </P> <P> This weekend, when Roe goes solo in the Lo-Tec Series at Three's Company's  studio in Hillcrest, there will be three new works by California women on the  program. But there will also be a couple of premieres that are not part of the  collection.  </P> <P> "I'm doing two works by men," Roe said, "and not all the choreography is from  California. That's why I'm calling this concert 'The Next Step.' This time the  dancing is very different -- and very difficult.  </P> <P> "The women's (choreography) is very physical and the men's are gentle. But  these are all very idiosyncratic works. I have had to retrain, and my body will  probably give up on me, but I won't give up."  </P> <P> Going it alone for a full evening is taxing enough to discourage most young  dancers from programming solo concerts. But Roe, 42, feels she's in her prime  as a performer.  </P> <P> "I'm in the best shape of my life," she said. "I work out three hours a day,  running and weightlifting. But this concert is a real challenge because the  styles are all so difficult and unusual for me. I do back slips and jazzy moves  that I never used to do."  </P> <P> Taking on new challenges is not new to Roe. When she made her first of four  trips to the Soviet Union to teach modern dance, she was "the first female solo  performer in the Soviet Union since Isadora Duncan," who visited in the 1920s,  Roe said.  </P> <P> For Roe's "Next Step" concert, scheduled for Saturday and Sunday at 8:30 p.m.,  she will also showcase one of her own works, along with five designed by her  colleagues. All are San Diego debuts.  </P> <P> "I have a nice little piece from Suzie Goldman, a former Alwin Nikolais  dancer," Roe said, "and I'm doing Susan Rose's 'In the Works.' They've both  been critically acclaimed. Bill Conrow made a new dance and Lonne Moretton  created something for me. I don't know how it will turn out."  </P> <P> Stephanie Gieliland's slinky and sultry solo, titled "To a KD Lang," is also on  tap for Roe's return to Lo-Tec this weekend.  </P> <P> "I'm so delighted to be dancing in San Diego again after a two-year absence,"  Roe said. "But I have to admit, I'm very nervous about this concert. It's my  biggest challenge."  </P></p>

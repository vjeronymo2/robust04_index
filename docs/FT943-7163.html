			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / TV ratings row erupts AC Nielsen Company of Japan, the Japanese arm of the US television ratings group, is at the centre of a growing row within the country's closed television rating and advertising industries, Emiko Terazono reports from Tokyo. The company has been accused by Japanese television networks of creating 'confusion' within the advertising sector with its new rating system, which it plans to introduce in November. Nielsen wants to launch a system based on individuals, rather than households as currently offered by Video Research, a rating agency owned by television networks and leading advertising companies. The association of private television networks yesterday demanded that Nielsen retract its plans, saying that the new system was unreliable, and that a 'consensus had yet to be reached among parties concerned' . Although the Japanese television advertising market has become one of the largest in the world, it has been tightly guarded by a few large companies, and the television networks, which charge corporate sponsors with high fees based on the ratings. Companies placing advertisements have been increasingly frustrated with Video Research's outmoded ratings system based on households, where it didn't matter whether 'a cat or dog was watching as long as the TV was switched on'.</p>

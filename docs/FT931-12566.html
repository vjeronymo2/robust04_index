			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Clashes between Hindus and Moslems in New Delhi A SOBBING Hindu woman, searching for her children last night, walks past a burnt Moslem shop in the old walled city of Delhi after clashes between groups of Hindus and Moslems. At least one man was killed and five others injured in the renewed outbreak of inter-religious violence, writes Stefan Wagstyl in New Delhi. The clashes demonstrated that tensions between Hindus and Moslems are still running high in the wake of the destruction seven weeks ago of the mosque at Ayodhya in northern India, which prompted riots across that part of the country. The trouble yesterday started when young Hindus stoned a small mosque in the predominantly Moslem old quarter, and set alight nearby shops and homes. Moslems fought back and the police opened fire. The dead man, believed to be a Moslem, died of stab wounds, they said. Police imposed curfews in the surrounding area and in other Moslem districts, including north-east Delhi, where considerable violence occurred last month. Other parts of the city, including government and commercial centres, stayed calm. Meanwhile, in Bombay, police were out in force in a suburb where two people had been killed on Tuesday by police fire after Moslems stoned a Hindu crowd.</p>

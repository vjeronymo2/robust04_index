			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / International Company News: Europa Metalli tumbles into red EUROPA Metalli, the industrial arm of Societa Metallurgica Italiana, Europe's biggest maker of semi-finished copper and alloy products, plunged to a L67.4bn (Dollars 44m) loss last year owing to the recession and problems at its big French subsidiary. In 1991, net profits at the company, which controls Kabelmetal in Germany and Trefimetaux in France, amounted to L10.9bn. Sales in 1992 rose by about 3 per cent to L3,112bn, based on average exchange rates for the year. However, the decline in demand was reflected in turnover in Ecu terms, which fell by about 0.5 per cent. Mr Luigi Orlando, chairman and main shareholder, attributed the sharp fall in earnings to financial factors and the recession. Extraordinary items in 1992 resulted in a loss of L3.2bn, compared with earnings of L32bn in 1991. Operations in France reported a heavy loss, while activities in Germany, which had buoyed other parts of the group, also witnessed a downturn in the second half. Meanwhile, the group's defence business, principally ammunition, remained heavily in the red owing to stagnant demand. The group forecast an upturn this year thanks to a restructuring plan involving investments of L150bn over the next two years to improve productivity and product quality, and lift sales. It also plans to cut its workforce, now about 11,000. by 14 per cent, with the sharpest reductions in France. Net group debt rose to L1,043bn from L863bn in 1991, although much of the increase was due to exchange rate factors. New Holland, the farm and construction equipment business formed from the acquisition by Fiat of Ford's New Holland subsidiary, is buying 50 per cent of Fabrica de Tractores Agricolas, a leading Mexican farm equipment maker. No price for the deal has been revealed. FTA, owned by the Mexican Barrera group, had sales of about Dollars 100m last year and controls around 40 per cent of the Mexican farm equipment market. The deal envisages the transfer of Fiat technology to FTA for tractors of between 65-100 horsepower and offers FTA access to the international New Holland sales network for its products.</p>

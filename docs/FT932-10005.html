			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / International Company News: Portuguese supermarket bid battle A TAKEOVER bid by Jeronimo Martins, the Portuguese food retailer, for supermarket chain Ino-Supermercados has been contested by a minority shareholder in Ino, Reuter reports from Lisbon. The objection raised by a 19.9 per cent shareholder has led the Portuguese Stock Exchange Commission to suspend trading in Ino shares on the Lisbon and Oporto stock exchanges. Jeronimo Martins owns 51 per cent of Ino indirectly through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Inovacao. Jeronimo Martins, partly-owned by Booker of the UK and Ahold of the Netherlands, operates 40 Pingo Doce supermarkets and the cash-and-carry chain Recheio. Acquisition of Ino would give Jeronimo Martins a further 53 Ino supermarkets, seven cash-and-carry stores and three Feira Nova hypermarkets, making it one of the country's top three supermarket chains. Portugal's Es3,500bn (Dollars 23.82bn) retail food industry is currently dominated by Sonae Investimentos-SGPS, running the Modelo supermarket and Continente hypermarket chain, and Super Companhia Portuguesa de Supermercados, which owns the Pao de Acucar supermarkets and Jumbo hypermarkets.</p>

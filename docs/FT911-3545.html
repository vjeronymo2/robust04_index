			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / The Middle East: West to build up military forces in north Iraq AN INCREASING number of western governments prepared yesterday to reinforce their military presence in Iraq, Turkey and Iran as part of the international effort to save the lives of Kurdish refugees. Iraq, meanwhile, formally asked the United Nations to take control of the 'safe havens' being established by US forces in northern Iraq. Britain is to send the 29 Commando Regiment of the Royal Artillery to the Turkey-Iraq border to join other elements of 3 Commando Brigade, defence sources say. They will take 105mm guns which can be slung under a Chinook helicopter. US defence officials confirmed that the US had sent a naval battle group, including the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt, from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean as a warning to Iraq not to interfere with the refugee operation. In Paris yesterday, Mr Tom King, the British defence secretary, agreed with Mr Pierre Joxe, his French counterpart to instruct their military staff to look into the possibility of extending refugee operations further east towards the border with Iran. Iraqi forces have remained in the northern Iraqi town of Zakho, defying US orders to move away and increasing tension in the area around the sites of the proposed refugee camps. 'Intimidation levels are really growing,' US Marine Staff Sergeant Lee Tibbetts told reporters at Silopi on the Turkish side of the border. 'It's a very, very tricky situation. I'm telling you, it's getting wild over there.' It is estimated that hundreds of refugees are still dying each day in the mountains despite the increased flow of international aid, and US officials are hoping to start moving people back to their homes or to the camps in Iraq in the next few days. Several armies have started to contribute to the relief effort. French paratroopers have set up an outpost near Zakho; Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany said yesterday that German troops would build a refugee camp in northern Iran; Spain is expected to send 500 soldiers to the area within a week, and Norway is considering a US request to send troops; Canadian, Belgian, Dutch and Italian troops are also involved. The Iraqi government, while criticising the US-led relief effort in Iraq as an infringement of the country's sovereignty, has not so far intervened militarily and continues to negotiate with Kurdish opposition leaders and to talk of political reforms. Yesterday the Iraqi news agency reported that the ruling Revolutionary Command Council had decreed that the cabinet would take on constitutional powers previously reserved for President Saddam Hussein. The decision by Kurdish organisations to begin negotiations with Mr Saddam's regime has been sharply criticised by other opposition groups which say he cannot be trusted. In the south, Shia Moslems - whose uprising in early March was crushed by government forces - continue to announce guerrilla attacks. The Iranian news agency yesterday quoted refugees arriving from southern Iraq as saying opposition forces clash nightly with Republican Guards in Shia Moslem areas. Fighting over the previous two nights took place in Basra, Tanumah and Qurnah, with a number of government soldiers killed and military equipment destroyed, the agency said.</p>

			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Philippines to allow sugar imports on raised tariff THE PHILIPPINES is lifting restrictions on the importation of sugar, even though the country is a major producer of the commodity. Mr Fidel Ramos, the Philippine president, confirmed the move this week despite local producers' and millers' protests at sugar's inclusion among 43 items listed in an import liberalisation plan published last month. The protests had prompted a review by a government panel. The lifting of restrictions will coincide with an increase in the import tariff on sugar from 50 per cent to 75 per cent, which is expected to take effect in October. Last week sugar industry leaders presented a petition to Mr Ramos seeking increased import tariffs on sugar, both raw and refined, and on artificial sweeteners. Mr Ramos had declared that his government, installed on June 30, would move towards greater deregulation of domestic industries and privatisation of more state enterprises. He said last week, however: 'Some basic industries in the Philippines need time to become more competitive through the acquisition of newer equipment and the development of better processes'. Sugar Industry leaders say that prices of sugar currently being offered in the world market are lower by up to 60 per cent than the average cost of production in the Philippines. The 75 per cent import tariff on raw sugar will be returned to 50 per cent in 1995. The Philippines is expected to produce some 2.1m tonnes of sugar in the crop year ending this August. Domestic consumption is estimated at some 1.6m tonnes and the country's quota in the US, its traditional market for sugar, is now down to only 178,380 tonnes. Industry leaders say exports to the world market are inevitable.</p>

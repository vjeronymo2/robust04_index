			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Chris Yeung, So Lai-Fun, and Fung Wai-Kong] </F>   [Text] China made it clear last night that the merger of  the United Democrats of Hong Kong and Meeting Point would not  change its belief that core members of the United Democrats were  subversive. Only hours after the two key liberal factions  announced they would form the Democratic Party in October,  mainland officials said that if the move was aimed at "mending  the fence between China and core United Democrats members", the  attempt was futile. The alliance, however, puts China in an  awkward predicament because it has consistently frozen out the  United Democrats while wooing other liberal factions to the  cause of planning post-1997 Hong Kong.    Meeting Point chairman Anthony Cheung Bing-leung, who was  enlisted by Beijing in the latest batch of Hong Kong affairs  advisers, stood staunchly behind the merger yesterday, clasping  hands with Martin Lee Chuming and Szeto Wah, the two United  Democrats most distrusted by China.    Announcing the formation of the party, a move which  apparently took Chinese officials by surprise, Mr Lee said the  need for a strong and united liberal coalition was becoming more  pressing as 1997 approached. "This is a time when we must not  be intimidated by threats from Beijing. We must take a stand on  principle, take a stand on human rights, the rule of law and the  development of democracy," Mr Lee said. "We represent a very  wide section of the community and if China tries to isolate us,  China's really trying to isolate the people of Hong Kong," he  said, noting that the new party would comprise at least 17  legislators.    In its manifesto, read out by Mr Cheung, the new party  declares that it supports Hong Kong's return to Chinese  sovereignty in 1997 as an autonomous and capitalist Special  Administrative Region of China. "We care for China, and, as  part of the Chinese citizenry, we have the rights and  obligations to participate in and comment on the affairs of  China," the manifesto said.    Mr Lee said that although Meeting Point as a party and  individuals in the United Democrats were members of the Hong  Kong Alliance in Support of the Patriotic Democratic Movement in  China, the group branded as subversive in the months after the  Tiananmen Square massacre, the new party would not be joining it.    The plan, however, did not sway China's attitude towards the  United Democrats, who were also leaders of the Alliance. "The  behaviour of these people is self-contradictory," a Chinese  official said. "They are, on one hand, saying there should be  dialogue with us. But on the other hand, they said they have to  overthrow the present government," he said repeating an  allegation which Mr Lee and Mr Szeto had denied.    While stressing that they were surprised about the merger  plan the officials said they needed to study the plan.  "Although there has been some gossip about the merger for some  time, it (the announcement) is news to me. We knew nothing  about it," one official said. Another official in charge of  Hong Kong affairs said he needed more information, such as the  background of the merger and the party's future plan and  platform. "There will not be room for dialogue if they do not  abandon their stance towards China," he said.    Mr Lee described the merger which had been planned since  January, as "a milestone in the history of the Hong Kong  democratic movement". "From various policies and remarks from  Beijing, including the recent Xi Yang incident, we find that the  room for manoeuvring is getting smaller," Mr Lee said. "When we  look ahead, particularly towards 1997, both the Meeting Point  and the United Democrats feel there is a necessity for us to  stand together."    The new party would not give up pursuing dialogue with China  -- an objective that he said the United Democrats had failed to  achieve. He dismissed the idea that the new party was intending  to gain any advantage in seeking communication with Beijing by  the incorporation of Mr Cheung. "Whatever we do, the ball still  remains in the Chinese court," Mr Lee said.    Mr Cheung said he would be pleased to explain to China about  the new party, and he would play a role in pursuing in this  direction. He denied that the merger was aimed at countering the  growing pro- China forces in the upcoming three-tier elections.  "We do not intend to be confrontational to anybody. We believe  that the public can exercise their free will to choose suitable  representatives," he said.    Both he and Mr Lee pledged to welcome other democrats,  whether they belonged to other parties or not, to join them.  "Our doors are open and all those who share the same beliefs  are welcome in the party," Mr Lee said. The party would  approach a number of people to participate in formulating its  structure and platform. Mr Cheung said the new party would not  threaten the survival of other small democratic parties, such as  the Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood. But he  pointed out that it would be up to individual groups to assess  their situation.    Extraordinary general meetings will be held separately on  May  15 to gauge members' view on the move and the timetable for  dissolving existing parties. Both will continue to function  until then and their legislators will hold joint meetings to  streamline their differences on policies and their work in  Legco. They will step up co-operation in the coming District  Board elections though it was still undecided whether their  candidates in the next elections would stand under the new name.    The parties have not always agreed and there were cases in  which they voted differently. These included votes on the  approval of the Chek Lap Kok airport site preparation contract,  the Container Terminal No 9 project and China's Most Favoured  Nation status. Mr Lee said past differences should be shelved  and past decisions respected.</p>

			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / International Capital Markets: Czechoslovak bank loan terms set benchmark A Czechoslovak bank has broken new ground for east European borrowers by successfully obtaining a syndicated loan at a spread of less than 100 basis points over London interbank rate. A five-year loan of Dollars 50m for Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka, the Czech and Slovak foreign trade bank, has been heavily oversubscribed, arranger Sumitomo Bank said. Demand was strong in spite of the most aggressive pricing attempted by an east European entity, at just 70 basis points above Libor with fees ranging up to 35 basis points. Despite initial market concern that the spread was too narrow, Sumitomo Bank raised Dollars 120m and oversubscription was 140 per cent. Chase Manhattan Bank, JP Morgan, Lloyds Bank, Midland Bank, Mitsubishi Trust &amp; Banking Corp, and Tokai Bank joined the syndicate and acted as lead managers. Syndicated loan markets have seen an inflow of liquidity which has lowered spreads for a typical European corporate borrower with a Single A rating from 45 basis points to as low as 20. In the Czech case, the narrowing has been faster. Investors have digested the split of Czechoslovakia, and the Czech Republic's economic indicators have continued to outperform those of other former communist countries. Standard &amp; Poor's, the US rating agency, upgraded the Czech National Bank, the central bank, to Triple B plus in July this year. A bond issue by CNB in March 1993, soon after Slovakia became independent, was sold at a spread of 272 to 278 basis points over comparable US Treasuries. Spreads fell to 120 basis points over Treasuries in an April 1994 issue by the City of Prague. The CSOB transaction, the first time a Czech corporation has tapped the syndicated loan market, establishes a new benchmark. Other east European borrowers have been drawn to the syndicated loan market but none has achieved the pricing of the Czech transactions. Banks heavily oversubscribed a Dollars 100m syndicated loan by InvesTel, the treasury arm of Hungarian telecommunications company Matav. The deal raised Dollars 197m and banks were scaled back to Dollars 150m.</p>

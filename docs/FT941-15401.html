			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Clinton tunes into Europe It really does not make too much difference if it is Peoria or Prague, Malibu or Moscow, Bill Clinton, never an easy man to pin down, is developing a certain consistency of behaviour. For starters, he will play the saxophone wherever he goes. He did so at a bar in Prague on Tuesday, in Boris Yeltsin's dacha on Thursday in the middle of a meal appropriately featuring lip of moose and undoubtedly would have performed at Kiev airport on Wednesday had the Ukrainian army jazz ensemble been rustled up in time to accompany him. He no longer needs to pack his own horn on Air Force One. He was presented with a new one in Brussels (the saxophone was invented by a Belgian, Adolphe Sachs) and a signed one by Vaclav Havel, the Czech president once better known for making music with words. The Russian saxophone industry is underdeveloped but Mr Yeltsin managed to come up with a small porcelain figurine featuring Mr Clinton carrying his beloved instrument. Jazz, of course, is the great American indigenous art form, along with the movies, which Ronald Reagan, about as good an actor as Mr Clinton is a sax player, deployed to some effect. At least Summertime, a favourite in the Clinton repertoire and an antidote to snowy Moscow, is more uplifting than Bedtime for Bonzo, if less funny. Next, this president cannot resist crowds, especially if they are to be found in restaurants and food shops, preferably those he remembers frequenting as a student travelling in Europe 25 years ago. Raised since, like most US politicians, on the rubber chicken circuit, he was irresistibly and understandably drawn to bread and sausage establishments in Moscow, no longer having to jump queues to get in and paying, like all good Russians are now supposed to, in roubles. He is also an unstoppable talker. This may happen quasi-informally, as this week he strolled in the Grande Place in Brussels, along the Charles Bridge in Prague and in and around Red Square here, or in his favourite forum, the televised 'town meeting,' such as took place yesterday afternoon at the Ostankino studios and at the Kmart store in Prague. Eclectic though he may be, however, his message is also getting consistent. A constant throughout his week in Europe has been the virtues of continental integration; in the Czech Republic and Russia the emphasis has been more on the virtues of democracy and market-oriented economic reform. His legendary empathy seems to be applied equally to the high and low. The Russians may be liking Boris Yeltsin less and less but Mr Clinton and the Russian president appear to get on famously, hugging and clutching each other and cracking jokes, presumably about defence conversion. Stern western Europeans, like Jacques Delors and Manfred Worner, have been charmed out of their socks, Helmut Kohl was compared to a sumo wrestler and he delicately avoided any discussion of basic issues, even retrospective ones, with John Major. In other respects, it has not been an easy week for Mr Clinton. He is reportedly still grieving for his mother, who died last week, and must have had part of his mind on the Whitewater developments back home in Washington. This has been a particular frustration for the 200 strong and progressively exhausted travelling White House press corps as it debated whether or not to press him on Whitewater. The denouement finally came in Kiev when a network TV reporter broke the ice and asked the question. For the first, and only, time this week, Bill Clinton was not amused.</p>

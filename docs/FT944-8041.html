			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Schools' League Tables: Colleges step up the fight on A-level battleground Today's performance tables reveal significant changes in the pattern of English education for post-16-year-olds. Further-education colleges, for long the Cinderellas of education, appear to be competing fiercely in the marketplace for A-level education. Following incorporation in April last year, all colleges have been removed from local authority control and are run as independent organisations. They are funded in relation to their student numbers. This has given them a strong incentive to recruit students who might at one time have gone to schools. Several colleges are sizeable institutions with more than 1,000 candidates entered for different qualifications. Many authorities also wanted to establish sixth-form colleges simply to save money, a move recommended by the Audit Commission among others. Four local education authorities - Richmond-upon-Thames, Salford, Bury and Harrow - no longer have any school sixth forms and entrust all their A-level provision to sixth-form colleges. The government only publishes local authorities' average A-level results for schools, however, and excludes further education colleges, so it is difficult to judge whether these policies have been successful. Some policymakers are worried that too many colleges now offer A-levels, and that their traditional concentration on vocational qualifications means they do not provide adequate academic competition for schools. In the past year the Department for Education gave approval to several schools catering for 11-16-year-olds to start sixth forms. Mr John Patten, the former education secretary, had said that schools without a sixth form were like 'a body without a head'. The figures lend this some support, but it is only limited. Several colleges which would be viable if they offered only vocational qualifications have started entering significant numbers of candidates for A-levels, and several appear to have rather weaker results than the average of all schools. It is difficult to measure this, however, as the government is trying to encourage a 'mixed economy' of A-levels and vocational qualifications, which in many cases will be good for entry to new universities. Thus it is hard to compare schools which do only A-levels with colleges where academic qualifications are often a supplement to a much more time-consuming vocational course. The Department for Education's tables tackle these problems by quoting the average Ucas points for candidates who attempt two or more A-levels, and for those who attempt one. The idea is to separate those taking an A-level to top up a vocational course from students taking a fully academic course, therefore providing a fairer comparison. Candidates trying two or more A-levels at colleges - and therefore making A-level the backbone of their courses - fared less well at further-education colleges, but the gap was small. According to government data, the average points score in schools was 16.7, but when all further education colleges were included, this fell to 15.3. The table lists the 20 colleges which offered the most vocational qualifications, and in most cases they also offered sizeable numbers of wholly A-level courses. In most of the cases listed A-level performance was significantly below average. However, many of the colleges, such as Sheffield, enter large numbers of candidates, making it much harder to maintain a high average. Calculations for Colchester Sixth-Form College (pictured), which last year entered 678 A-level candidates, demonstrate the distortions large numbers of entrants can cause. The college's most successful 100 candidates this year gained an average of 33.07 Ucas points, a score which would have ranked them in the top five for the country, among selective schools which have about 100 pupils per year.</p>

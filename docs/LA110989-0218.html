			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> BANK BACKS OFF ALLEGHENY LOAN  </P> <P> Allegheny International Inc., the maker of Sunbeam and Oster brand appliances,  today said Wells Fargo Bank has withdrawn its $400-million financing commitment  for a bankruptcy reorganization plan.  </P> <P> Financial commitments are being discussed and other financial alternatives are  being explored, AI said in a statement.  </P> <P> Allegheny filed its most recent reorganization plans Oct. 11 under which it and  its subsidiaries would emerge from Chapter 11 protection.  </P> <P> The Wells Fargo capital withdrawal comes in the wake of an offer by the New  York investment group Japonica Partners to buy AI for $638.8 million. The offer  made late Wednesday is less than the $700 million Japonica bid last July for  AI. Japonica said it would consider paying more than $700 million for AI if it  is allowed to review certain undisclosed financial information.  </P></p>

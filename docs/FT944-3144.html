			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / International Capital Markets: Successful launch for Airbus Finance loan Airbus Finance, the finance company established by Airbus Industrie, the European aircraft-building consortium, has raised Dollars 1.5bn in its debut syndicated loan, which was signed yesterday. The loan, arranged by J. P Morgan, which also advised the company, launched as a Dollars 1bn deal but increased to Dollars 1.5bn after receiving an enthusiastic response from banks. It was syndicated among banks that already had a relationship with the company, which intends to return to the syndicated loans market and also to eventually tap the international capital markets. Airbus Industries' four shareholders, Aerospatiale of France, Daimler-Benz of Germany, British Aerospace of Britain and Construcciones Aeronauticas of Spain, have guaranteed the seven-year loan, which was launched with an interest rate of 30 basis points above Libor for the first four years of the loan and 35 basis points over Libor for the remaining three years. Using Airbus Finance to raise the loan eases the strain on the balance sheets of the four partners in the project, and eventually it is hoped the company, which will provide finance to Airbus Industries customers for the purchase of aircraft, will become a separately rated stand-alone company.</p>

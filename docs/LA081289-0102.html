			<p><P> August 12, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS: TWA REPORTS A $4.4-MILLION LOSS IN ITS SECOND QUARTER  </P> <P> Trans World Airlines Inc. reported Friday a net loss of $4.4 million for the  second quarter, which it attributed partly to expenses stemming from last  year's privatization of the carrier.  </P> <P> TWA, owned by takeover specialist Carl C. Icahn, said its second-quarter loss  contrasted with a net profit of $97.2 million in the same period in 1988.  </P> <P> The year-earlier results include a one-time gain from litigation between TWA  and the estate of the late Howard Hughes, a previous owner. The results for the  latest quarter do not include about $87 million in unrealized gains from TWA's  investment portfolio, the company said.  </P> <P> The latest loss occurred despite a 5.7% increase in second-quarter revenue to  $1.20 billion from $1.14 billion.  </P> <P> Late last week, TWA suspended contract talks with the machinists union because  of the possibility of a merger or change in management at the airline, union  officials said.  </P></p>

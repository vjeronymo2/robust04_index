			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Smithfield gets two council seats At least two meat traders from the Smithfield meat market are assured of places on the council which controls the City of London. The next election will take place on December 6, but the Smithfield tenants are already guaranteed at least two seats, because in one ward which has four seats on offer, four of the six candidates are traders. Smithfield candidates are standing in 10 wards as part of their campaign against the rents they are being asked to pay to fund refurbishment of the market. In a statement, the traders said two sitting members had withdrawn 'rather than face defeat by the Smithfield candidates'. This year's elections will be the most hotly contested for more than 50 years, with elections required in 13 of the 25 wards - normally only three or four wards are contested, and some have not had a contested election for more than 25 years. The Corporation of London, which has tried to encourage businesses to make use of the franchise, said the traders were quite entitled to take their stand, but added that the traders' campaign was 'quite inappropriate for resolving what is essentially a landlord-tenant dispute'.</p>

What are your views on nuclear  arms, and how do you explain the continued nuclear activities of  Pakistan against loud criticism and accusations that it is  weapon- oriented at a time when the world trend is towards  disarmament in the wake of the collapse of the Soviet Union?    A: Pakistan does not oppose the NPT. We have never refused  to endorse the NPT. However, as a matter of principle we cannot  accept discriminatory treatment vis-a-vis our neighbour India.  In fact, as early as 1979, Pakistan had proposed simultaneous  adherence by India and Pakistan to the Non-Proliferation Treaty.  In that year we had also proposed that the two countries should  simultaneously accept the IAEA safeguards. We have also called  for the establishment of a nuclear weapons free zone in South  Asia and a bilateral/regional nuclear test ban. Regrettably  India has taken a negative stance on all these fair and  constructive proposals which are aimed at preventing nuclear  proliferation in our region.    When the NPT was adopted in the U.N. General Assembly in  1968; Pakistan voted for it. We clarified then that Pakistan  would sign the NPT if our neighbour India did so also. Pakistan  has always been concerned about India's desire to develop  nuclear weapons. These fears were realised when India exploded a  nuclear device in 1974. Pakistan continues to maintain a  principled position that it will accept any non-proliferation  measure that is equitable and non- discriminatory between  Pakistan and India. Therefore, if India signs the NPT, Pakistan  will do so simultaneously.    On nuclear arms, let me state it categorically that Pakistan  fully shares the view that nuclear proliferation would be  destablishing and would threaten international peace and  security. This is more true after the end of the cold war and  the landmark agreements between the U.S. and Russia to reduce  their nuclear arsenals. Pakistan has resolutely supported  international efforts aimed at achieving complete nuclear  disarmament as well as nonproliferation, particularly through  the establishment of equitable and non-discriminatory regional  non-proliferation regimes.    Our position regarding the U.S. nuclear policy in South Asia  is that the Pressler Amendment which has created difficulties in  the Pak-U.S. relationship, is a discriminatory law as it applies  only to Pakistan and not to India or other countries which are  known to be seeking a nuclear non-proliferation as India feels  no compulsion to respond to the many constructive measures we  have proposed for keeping South Asia free of nuclear weapons.  The criticism against Pakistan over the nuclear issue is  unjustified.    We remain committed to using our nuclear programme for  peaceful purposes only.    While, in the development of this peaceful nuclear  programme,  we have acquired a certain technical capability, Pakistan has  taken a firm political decision not to use this capability to  produce nuclear weapons. Statements made by us reflectng this  position are meant as reaffirmation of the peaceful nature of  Pakistan's nuclear programme to preclude any misunderstanding.</p>

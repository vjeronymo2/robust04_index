Of the cases reported, 70 percent were male. A report from  the Director of Health Services, Dr Lovemore Mbengeranwa, tabled  before the council on Thursday said that 264 of the cases had  been diagnosed as sputum positive pulmonary TB and 42 as sputum  negative pulmonary TB.    A total of 676 notifcations were received and investigated,  and TB accounted for 544 of them, the director said.    There was a decrease in the number of sexually transmitted  diseases cases reported at primary care clinics compared to the  same period last year. The 20 to 34 age group, however, remained  the high-risk group.    Meanwhile, 12 cholera cases were reported during the same  period and measures were taken to prevent the spread of the  disease.</p>

			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Canadian Pizza Pounds 30m tag CANADIAN Pizza, the Salford-based maker of pizza bases which is coming to the market this month, is likely to be valued at Pounds 30m, according to its pathfinder prospectus - Pounds 10m less than the company estimated last month. Canadian Pizza, which forecast pre-tax profits of at least Pounds 3.15m (Pounds 2.21m) for 1993, said the Pounds 10m had originally been earmarked to build a factory in France: 'At that stage our view was that we would raise the money on the market place. 'Having done projections and cash flows, we have decided that we are cash generative, we are going to start off in an ungeared position and we will borrow at that particular time. So we have greatly reduced the amount of money we plan to raise', said Mr Reg Bolton, finance director. Some of the shares, due to be priced on November 3, are likely to be placed with institutions with the remainder placed subject to claw back in an open offer. The last date for applications will be November 10. Canadian Pizza said the flotation, sponsored by Robert Fleming with Hoare Govett as brokers, offered an exit to venture capital backers, Murray Johnstone, 3i and ECI Ventures, who supported the company in a Pounds 15.5m management buy-out from its founder shareholders in May last year.</p>

The offer was clearly welcome in Sweden,  while Finland and Norway were clearly less delighted.    Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto received a question about  this after he and Foreign Trade Minister Pertti Salolainen  yesterday briefed the Eduskunta Foreign Affairs Committee on the  situation in the negotiations. He did not exactly make an  effort to dismiss the "divide and rule" theory.    "The EU is a very skillful negotiator that exploits all the  factors it can make use of...."    Haavisto pointed out that the new EU offer is very different  from the views that the EU Commission has expressed in the past.  "The offer takes Sweden's special needs into consideration to an  exceptionally high degree," he said.    On the other hand Haavisto said that he does not think that  there "really exists any Nordic front." The reports of Nordic  cooperation on agricultural questions only mean that people have  backed the idea that each individual country's agreement will  build on the same components and be drafted in such a way that  it does not cause difficulties for any other applicant. These  components are the EU's own support arrangements, the  much-desired special Nordic support, and environmental support.  The foreign minister still believes that the EU is striving for  "parallel solutions" on agriculture in the case of all the  Nordic countries.    And even if the EU were trying intentionally to split the  Nordic front, Haavisto does not think that it is possible to  draw from this the conclusion that Sweden is being given  priority over Finland and Norway as a potential EU member. All  three countries are probably seen as attractive in this context.    As far as regional support is concerned, Haavisto said that  Finland still has the central goal of achieving regional support  under the Objective 1 classification. However, the new  Objective 6 model can clearly been discussed if it is possible  to "extend the regions covered in the same way that Sweden has  been allowed to do."    Thus the minimum demand is that Finland must be given  regional support that is as favorable as that which Sweden has  received.    According to reports, the ministers' main message to the  Foreign Affairs Committee was that a negotiated result can only  be achieved if the national leaderships of the 12 EU countries  now take an active part in the negotiations and give their  negotiators orders to strive in earnest for results. Foreign  Minister Haavisto described Finland's room for maneuver as  limited.    The committee members contented themselves with asking  questions of the of the ministers and Foreign Ministry  officials; according to reports, there was no suggestion of  giving the negotiators orders.    Social Democratic Party chairman Paavo Lipponen, who himself  is a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, said after the  meeting with the ministers that Finland cannot count on pushing  through all its demands on all the difficult issues.  Nevertheless he is expecting that it will be possible to  achieve a result in the negotiations.    According to Lipponen, the government's list of priorities  with regard to agriculture -- first an agreement on so-called  northern support, then the transitional arrangements, and then  production quotas -- is the right one, but it will probably be  necessary to compromise on all these points. Lipponen said that  the new regional support that has been offered "is not  necessarily impossible for Finland if it is possible to have it  adjusted." In his view it is also possible for Finland to make  an immediate transition to EU price levels. However, this would  presuppose financial support for Finnish agriculture for a  transitional period.    Lipponen seemed fairly satisfied with the information he had  received. However, he said it was sometimes difficult to know  whether it was the foreign minister or the chairman of the  Central Association of Agricultural Producers [Haavisto's former  position] who was speaking....</p>

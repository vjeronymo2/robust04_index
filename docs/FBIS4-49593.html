			<p>BFN     [Text] Jiang Chunyun, secretary of the provincial party  committee, convened a forum in Jinan on 5 May with the  participation of factory directors and managers of 12  enterprises from across the province to commonly discuss how to  successfully invigorate large and medium-sized, state-owned  enterprises.    Jiang Chunyun stressed: All levels of party committees and  governments should truly pay attention to invigorating large and  medium-sized state-owned enterprises by putting the endeavor in  this regard in an even more important and conspicuous position.  Such enterprises should depend on in-depth reform and greater  vitality to forge ahead continuously with a view to again  creating brilliant achievements.    Recently, Jiang Chunyun has convened forums one after  another  on the issue of invigorating large and medium-sized state-owned  enterprises and has gone deep into enterprises to conduct  investigations many times. The 5-May forum was held amid a warm  atmosphere. At that forum, factory directors and managers of 12  enterprises introduced their experiences and methods and offered  some good opinions and suggestions for successfully running  large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises.    At that forum, Jiang Chunyun pointed out: For a long time,  our large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises have made  tremendous contributions to developing the province's national  economy and have vigorously supported the progress of reform and  opening up as well as the modernization drive, thus becoming a  major and key force on which the province has depended to  maintain stability and promote development. In establishing the  socialist market economic structure, the foundation lies in the  modern enterprise system with public ownership as the mainstay.  In developing the socialist market economy, the main force lies  in large and medium-sized state- owned enterprises. The success  in invigorating large and medium- sized state-owned enterprises  has a bearing on the overall situation of the entire party and  the whole country and on the superiority of the socialist system  where public ownership is the mainstay, thus is very important  both in the economy and politics. Leaders at all levels must  list the endeavor of invigorating large and medium-sized  state-owned enterprises as a major item on their daily agenda  and actually pay attention to this work until results are  achieved.    Jiang Chunyun pointed out: The current situation in the  province's large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises can be  summarized as follows: Achievements are great, problems are  numerous, and the future is bright. At present, the state is  adopting a series of measures to invigorate large and  medium-sized state-owned enterprises, and such enterprises  themselves also have the superiority of being furnished with  good technological equipment and high-quality cadres, staff, and  workers. Therefore, we should not only face up to unfavorable  factors but also catch sight of favorable factors and  conditions, enhance confidence, and carry forward the spirit of  advancing despite difficulties in an effort to walk out of the  plight as quickly as possible.    Jiang Chunyun stressed: The fundamental way to invigorate  large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises lies in the  efforts to further deepen enterprise reform, accelerate the  establishment of the modern enterprise system, and change from  the planned economic structure to the socialist market economic  structure.    Jiang Chunyun pointed out: To invigorate large and  medium-sized state-owned enterprises, we should pay attention to  renewing and upgrading their products, increasing the content of  science and technology of products, and enhancing the  competitiveness of their products on markets. In addition, we  should pay attention to following the road of integration to  develop a number of transregional and transprofessional large  enterprise groups, with large and mediums-sized state-owned  enterprises as the mainstay, and with integrated property rights  as the main link. We should pay attention to improving  management, enhancing internal skills, tapping our potentials,  and foster the idea of quality first, beneficial results first,  and efficiency first. We should also pay attention to building  the ranks of workers and wholeheartedly depend on the working  class.</p>

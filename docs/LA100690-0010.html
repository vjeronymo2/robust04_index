			<p><P> October 6, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FRANKLIN STRUGGLES, BEATS MARSHALL, 10-7  </P> <P> In recent years, a game against Marshall High meant an easy victory for the  Franklin football team.  </P> <P> Franklin, the defending City Division 3-A champion, struggled to beat Marshall,  10-7, Friday in a Northern Conference opener at Marshall.  </P> <P> Under former Coach Armando Gonzalez, Franklin (2-2) won three City  championships in the last four years while compiling a 44-5 record.  </P> <P> "I'm upset at the way we played today," said Coach Ed Elias, a former Alhambra  assistant who replaced Gonzalez this year. "We played a terrible second half  and lost our intensity. This is a young team, and we're making young mistakes.  </P> <P> "It has been frustrating this season because we've had so many injuries and  academic ineligibilities. We're playing with a completely makeshift defense."  </P> <P> One key player missing was returning All-City linebacker Julius Rice, who is  academically ineligible and watched from the sidelines Friday.  </P> <P> Although Elias seemed most concerned with the defense, the offense struggled  against Marshall (1-3). After scoring 10 first-quarter points, the Panthers  never threatened. They finished with 152 yards of total offense -- 46 on the  ground -- and seven first downs.  </P> <P> Running back John Flores scored Franklin's only touchdown on a 13-yard run off  left tackle. Five minutes later Julio Merino, who also starts at quarterback,  kicked a 37-yard field goal to give the Panthers a 10-0 lead.  </P> <P> Marshall scored in the third quarter on Jose Rodriquez's four-yard touchdown  run that capped a 25-yard drive set up by a fumble.  </P> <P> The Barristers had a chance to win the game in the fourth quarter but lost the  ball on a fumble on the Franklin 27.  </P></p>

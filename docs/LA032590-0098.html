			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE BEST DRESS COMPETITION;  </P> <P> FASHION: THE ACADEMY AWARDS MAKE FOR TV'S MOST GLAMOROUS NIGHT. DESIGNERS AND  STORES WANT TO BE PART OF IT.  </P> <P> SCENE 1: Rodeo Drive, 1986. An actress wanders through the Torie Steele  boutiques, looking for a dress to wear to the Oscars. She admires a gown and  asks a salesclerk whether the designer can make something special for her. He  is delighted and sends an $8,000 dress -- made to her measurements -- from  Europe. Meanwhile, the actress makes the same request in three other European  boutiques on the street. She wears none of the four dresses on Oscar night, but  keeps them all. After several trans-Atlantic shouting matches, her agent is  presented with some whopping dress bills.  </P> <P> SCENE 2: Backstage at the Oscars, 1987. After presenting the Best Director  Oscar to Oliver Stone for "Platoon," Elizabeth Taylor heads through the barrage  of cameras and reporters that all presenters and winners must face. Only Taylor  isn't in the mood to talk. In fact, she looks as if she's going to charge right  through the press gauntlet, leaving a trail of public relations people in her  wake. Above the din, a reporter shouts, "Miss Taylor, who designed your dress?"  Taylor stops dead in her tracks, whirls around in her hourglass dress of pink  silk taffeta, smiles, and says: "Nolan Miller." Then she sweeps past the rest  of the crowd without another word.  </P> <P> SCENE 3: Mid-Oscar telecast, 1988. Two-time Oscar winner Olivia de Havilland is  scheduled to present an award late in the show, and she's been sitting in the  audience for several hours. Moments before she is scheduled to go on, costumer  Ray Aghayan sees that her beautiful red chiffon dress is terribly wrinkled. He  whisks De Havilland to a wardrobe room under the football stadium-sized  auditorium, where a crew works with cartoon-like speed to press the dress while  she's still in it. De Havilland, the consummate and dignified pro, is the only  one in the room who's fully composed.  </P> <P> Every year, Oscar lore is enriched by costume feats and fiascoes. But despite  the tension, the cost, the drama, the politics and the scams, the Academy  Awards make for the most glamorous night on television, and designers,  costumers and stores all scramble to be part of it.  </P> <P> It is such a plum that designer Gianfranco Ferre, for example, while in the  midst of presenting his fall ready-to-wear collection for Christian Dior in  Paris, stopped everything to make two dresses for Best Actress nominee Isabelle  Adjani, who is scheduled to attend Monday night's ceremonies. One is a gold  gown with embroidery; the other, a black dress with a white embroidered organza  jacket.  </P> <P> For the second year in a row, the Giorgio Armani boutique in Beverly Hills is  dressing a small army of men and women who will participate in the ceremony.  </P> <P> Armani himself has been quoted as saying he's dressing Best Actress nominees  Michelle Pfeiffer, Jessica Tandy, Jessica Lange and presenter Jodie Foster. In  addition, he's dressing Best Supporting Actress nominee Julia Roberts. But  Armani and his staff are characteristically mum about the specifics, saying  actresses often change their minds at the last minute. Indeed, Lange has  arranged to view dresses from Fred Hayman Beverly Hills on Monday morning.  </P> <P> (It is ironic that Armani would be the front-runner in the Oscar fashion race  because the Milanese designer is not known for his women's evening wear, but,  rather, his clean, spare and neutral-colored daytime clothes.)  </P> <P> Fred Hayman, a store that is in the midst of a nationwide perfume launch, has  taken on the task of being the official fashion coordinator to the show for the  second year. The store doesn't receive a fee, and Hayman does not believe that  the cash registers will ring more frequently after the two-second credit  flashes before the show's 1 billion viewers. "The residual effect is primarily  image," he says.  </P> <P> In general, stores call a nominated actress to ask whether she would like to  buy or borrow a dress only if she is already a customer. But that tradition is  starting to change. Hayman's store and the Armani boutique were the first  retailers to jump in with both feet. Others, like Amen Wardy, are ready to try  their luck. "I have a list of (nominees') names and I'm going to call them,"  says Wardy, who could pick up some of the notoriously last-minute Oscar  business.  </P> <P> In some instances, actresses will call up their favorite designers for advice.  When Glenn Close agreed to be a presenter this year, she called Geoffrey Beene  and they came up with a design for an outfit. Close was also savvy enough to  check in with the Academy Awards producer, Gilbert Cates, to ask him about all  the elements that might affect her wardrobe choice. "Glenn Close is hosting the  London portion of the show at the Ritz and she and I had a long conversation,"  says Cates. "She asked all the right questions, like, 'Do I make an entrance?'  and 'Are the shots head to toe?' We don't give actresses guidelines about what  to wear, but we will discuss everything with them."  </P> <P> Close will appear in a high-neck, long-sleeved black dress that Beene says was  inspired not only by her needs but also by Close's next role as Queen Gertrude  in Franco Zeffirelli's "Hamlet," which begins filming soon in London.  </P> <P> In other cases, an actress might pick up a dress right out of a designer's  private sample closet. Best Supporting Actress nominee Dianne Wiest went to  Carolyne Roehm's New York design studio and fell in love with a long navy  sheath. (The wool crepe dress has white georgette sleeves with a diamond spray  design.)  </P> <P> Typically, when an actress picks a sample, she usually just borrows the dress  for the night. Donna Karan spokeswoman Christy Hood says Karan doesn't mind if  actresses tuck, hem or do minor alterations on borrowed goods, but "cutting off  a dress wouldn't be allowed." Hood sent two samples to Karan devotee and Oscar  presenter Candice Bergen: a pink beaded dress and a gold Fortuny-pleated silk  organza tunic and skirt.  </P> <P> At Carolyne Roehm, public relations director Lisa Schiek says dresses are  loaned and returned. "We never say, 'Keep it.' The dresses are too expensive."  </P> <P> Schiek has called a nominee when she felt a particular dress would be perfect  for her, "but it's not the norm," she says. "They usually call us and it's not  unusual to get a call at the last minute."  </P> <P> The jewelry firm Harry Winston, whose relationship with Hollywood stars dates  to the days of Marilyn Monroe singing "Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend," is  also very liberal with Oscar night loans and will call stars to see whether  they need anything. Actresses who have accepted the offer this year include  Close, Wiest and presenter Geena Davis.  </P> <P> Solicited and unsolicited goods can pile up, as some actresses find. In 1988,  Best Supporting Actress nominee Anne Archer received four boxes of gowns, only  one of which was actually requested. She ended up sending everything back and  paying full price for a Vicky Tiel dress at Maxfield.  </P> <P> Stores like Maxfield and Amen Wardy insist that actresses buy, not borrow. The  Armani boutique loans clothes, but only from a special sample line, which is  later returned to the designer and never sold.  </P> <P> In the case of individual designers, Europeans will loan and give clothes,  while Americans tend to loan or sell.  </P> <P> "Valentino and lots of other European designers want American celebrities in  their front rows at fashion shows and they want them wearing their clothes.  They consider it a coup," says Valentino boutique manager Tom Bruno. "They love  the Oscars because they're shown around the world and it's good publicity.  American designers are more interested in the socialites like Pat Buckley and  Nan Kempner wearing their clothes."  </P> <P> Ray Aghayan, this year's Oscar telecast costume designer, says neither he nor  longtime business associate Bob Mackie give dresses outright to actresses.  </P> <P> Mackie customer Cher is very particular about her clothing arrangements with  the designer and even with the briefest of outfits, will pick up the tab, says  Aghayan. "She's very meticulous about that."  </P> <P> Actors and actresses who perform on the show are clothed at the Academy's cost.  Aghayan says there is no huge opening number Monday night, and that the musical  numbers on the show will have "a quiet elegance, as opposed to last year." His  dress for Diana Ross, who is singing on the telecast, is a long, bias-cut  column of white crepe. He collaborated with the singer on details such as the  neckline, the train and embroidery.  </P> <P> For those presenters and nominees who borrow dresses from Fred Hayman's store,  the arrangements are more complicated. As official Oscar fashion coordinator,  the store's staff wrote to numerous designers asking them to ship over dresses  to be loaned out. Hayman says he weeded out things that he considered too  simple or not glamorous enough, then wrote to all the actresses who are  nominated or presenting awards and invited them in.  </P> <P> Daryl Hannah, an Academy Award presenter, took advantage of the Fred Hayman  Oscar closet and selected a white, sequined, tea-length Vicky Tiel dress with a  satin bow placed strategically on her derriere.  </P> <P> Because this year's crop of actresses is spread out all over the globe, Fred  Hayman's task of reaching everyone was difficult. Polaroid photographs had to  be sent out to Best Actress nominee Pauline Collins because she wasn't due to  arrive in Los Angeles until the last moment. (Collins, like Lange, is scheduled  to view dresses from Fred Hayman on Monday morning.) A van of dresses went out  to presenter Melanie Griffith on the set of her movie "Pacific Heights."  Between takes she tried on clothes and narrowed them down to a black Vicky Tiel  gown with lace trim and an orange silk sheath with a matching beaded jacket by  Eva Chun.  </P> <P> If an actress finds a dress in Hayman's stock, she would be allowed to borrow  it and return it clean and undamaged. She signs a letter of indemnification  that says she's responsible for the cost if it's soiled, lost, stolen or not  returned.  </P> <P> Some of the Oscar attendees are still wavering about what to wear. Anjelica  Huston has picked out two dresses: a floor-length Bob Mackie frock, covered in  sequins and bugle beads from Fred Hayman and a short, sleeveless, python  printed silk dress by Eva Chun (a California-based designer) that she purchased  from I. Magnin.  </P> <P> Uncommitted dressers were still combing the racks last week. At mid-week Jane  Fonda was seriously considering something from the Versace couture collection  on Rodeo Drive but hadn't made her final choice.  </P></p>

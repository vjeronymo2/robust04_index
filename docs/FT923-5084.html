			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Classic blast at Radio 3 CLASSIC FM, Britain's first national commercial radio station, yesterday criticised BBC Radio 3 for moving towards Classic's position in the marketplace. Mr John Spearman, chief executive of the new station, to be launched on Monday, said the recent format changes at Radio 3 seemed to be taking it towards the position it thought Classic FM would occupy. There was plenty of room for both, he said. The new station, which will broadcast on a range of frequencies from 100-102 FM in different parts of the country, will open on Monday.</p>

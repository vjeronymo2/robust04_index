			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / Volvo chief denies he betrayed Gyllenhammar over merger Mr Soren Gyll, the chief executive of Volvo, yesterday denied he betrayed Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, who last week resigned as Volvo's chairman after Mr Gyll led a management revolt against plans for a merger with Renault of France. Mr Gyll in an interview with the Financial Times said: 'This is the worst decision I have ever been involved in. It is a serious one, of course, but I was prepared to take all the responsibility.' The days leading up to Thursday's Volvo board meeting were fraught. Mr Gyll decided a week ago that shareholder pressure meant the controversial merger with Renault was unlikely to succeed. But the crucial meeting was on Tuesday night when senior managers gathered at Mr Gyll's home. After two hours of discussion the managers from Volvo's car and truck divisions agreed the merger should not proceed. The following day 25 managers signed a letter asking Mr Gyll to recommend the board drop the merger plan. That day when Mr Gyllenhammar returned from the US, Mr Gyll met him in private. He told him that the senior management opposed the deal, which he believed was unlikely to be approved by shareholders on December 7. The following morning Mr Gyll warned his wife: 'This could be my last board meeting.' 'I didn't know when I went into the board meeting what the outcome would be,' he explained. 'They could have fired me. I could have been shooting myself in the head.' Mr Gyll reiterated his desire to continue a three-year old alliance with Renault, saying joint projects could still be constructed on a 50-50 basis. He said he would be talking with Mr Louis Schweitzer, the Renault chief executive, as early as last night, although he acknowledged time was needed for the two sides 'to cool down'.

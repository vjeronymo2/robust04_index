			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Civil service union votes against strike GOVERNMENT PLANS for a shake-up in civil service pay received a boost yesterday as members of the 114,000-strong National Union of Civil and Public Servants voted not to strike against them. The six-to-four vote significantly reduces the chances that any union will take action against proposals to extend performance pay, devolve pay determination to departments and agencies and keep this year's increases to around the rate of inflation. The 125,000 members of the Civil and Public Services Association have already voted to accept a deal similar to that offered to the NUCPS. The NUCPS vote, details of which were being withheld by the union's leadership last night, was in spite of the union's conference last month recommending a strike. Conference delegates and many of the union's leadership are opposed to the devolution of pay settlements to departments and to the extension of performance-related pay. They are also angry about the level of the offer, which will lead to basic pay rises of 4.1 per cent from April 1 and, taking performance pay awards into account, will add 4.5 per cent to the salary bill. Members of the NUCPS may be given a further vote on whether they think the union should sign an agreement with the Treasury.</p>

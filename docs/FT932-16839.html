			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / UK Company News: Isosceles deal close to agreement BANKERS involved in the Pounds 1.4bn refinancing of Isosceles, parent of the troubled Gateway food retail chain, are now confident that the deal is close to being agreed. The company is due to approve the arrangements at a board meeting early next week which will be followed by a formal presentation to the 38 banks involved. Agreement in principle is expected shortly after Easter subject to documentation. Isosceles, formed in 1989 through a Pounds 2bn leveraged buy-out, has a standstill agreement with its banks until May 28 but was keen to sign the refinancing well before then to reassure its trade creditors. The deal involves Gateway assuming Pounds 500m of debt, which it should be able to service from trading, and Isosceles having about Pounds 140m of debt. Lenders will also receive deep discounted bonds, preference shares and ordinary shares for their loans. The mezzanine holders are understood to have agreed the terms which will mean heavy losses for them.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Israel Atomic Energy Commission [IAEC] says  that 20 radioactivity monitoring stations are currently located  around the Dimona nuclear reactor. Since the reactor was  established, however, there have been no mishaps, leaks, or  radioactive contamination incidents. Our correspondent Shulamit  Schmerling was told by the IAEC that the monitoring stations  merely serve as a security valve, whereas the safety operations  are carried out within the reactor's laboratories. The IAEC has  implemented the lessons of the Chernobyl nuclear reactor  disaster relating to emergency preparations and relaying  reliable information to the public.</p>

			<p><P> March 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUR NUMBER WILL SOON BE UP IN GIRL SCOUT COOKIE SALE  </P> <P> Sorry, girls, but, in today's world, you've got to have more than just a  melting smile and a winsome ponytail to sell Thin Mints and Tagalongs and  Trefoil shortbreads. It takes perseverance, salesmanship, accounting -- and a  telephone.  </P> <P> For selling is serious business, and Girl Scouts of the USA is bound and  determined to turn out accomplished sales representatives. The wares are the  same, but the tools have changed.  </P> <P> For the first time in the Los Angeles Basin, the Girl Scout council is teaching  its oldest green-clad charges to function as sophisticated telemarketers,  transforming their dens into baked-goods boiler rooms and themselves into  silken-voiced saleswomen.  </P> <P> Tips, straight from the Girl Scout manual, include: "Save your telephone sales  cards. They will become valuable references for next year and following years."  And: "Careful selection of words and your tone of voice must generate the image  of someone that people trust."  </P> <P> It's too soon to tell how many members of the Angeles Girl Scout Council will  heed that advice and start selling over the phone, scout officials said. But  the practice could give the girls, ages 13 to 18, a new tool to replace the one  they invariably lose as they grow older.  </P> <P> "The older girls have the feeling that people don't want to buy from them,"  said Billy Vanderpool, a board member and cookie sales trainer for the Angeles  Council. "They're not cute little girls. And, also, it's embarrassing to go out  in your uniform when you're 16. And this gets the girls more involved in the  business aspects so they can apply it to their own career future."  </P> <P> Hawking Samoas and Golden Yangels and Do-Si-Dos still supplies most of the  money that keeps the 78-year-old organization afloat. But growing health and  safety concerns and changes in the American family have caused the group's 333  regional councils to turn to increasingly sophisticated marketing techniques in  addition to the traditional door-to-door sales.  </P> <P> Consider:  </P> <P>  -- Since the mid-1980s, Girl Scouts have been specially trained for  confrontations with the nutritionally correct. They are armed with written  pitches provided by the companies licensed to bake for the group, and they are  skilled, as these manuals say, at "turning negatives into positives."  </P> <P> A neighbor says cookies are bad for the health? If the scout is on her toes,  she'll answer: "Our cookies contain no preservatives and no artificial colors  and are made with 100% vegetable shortening."  </P> <P> And she'll tell that naysayer that Trefoil shortbreads have only 30 calories  each, that the chocolate chip cookies are rich in fiber, low in fat, sweetened  with real fruit juice and have 25% less sodium.  </P> <P>  -- The San Gorgonio Girl Scout Council instituted an 800 number in 1989, so  potential customers could place their orders directly at the group's  headquarters in Colton. Older Girl Scouts packaged the cookies for delivery by  United Parcel Service.  </P> <P> The result of this and a few additional modifications? A 28% surge in orders,  the biggest percentage increase for any council in the nation.  </P> <P> "We want everyone who wants Girl Scout cookies to get them," said Vern  Woodlies, director of fund development for the San Gorgonio group. "With both  parents working, it's not possible to have all the girls do door-to-door  sales."  </P> <P>  -- The Girl Scout Council of Greater New York has found that it pays to know  the market. As a result, the group takes cookie orders in February but does not  deliver the wares until late April or early May.  </P> <P> "We have to take Passover into consideration in the New York market," Kathy  Gallo, the group's spokeswoman, said. "(Many Jews cannot) have Girl Scout  cookies in the house, so we wait until the holiday's over. Our delivery date is  always contingent on when Passover is."  </P> <P>  -- To keep up with rising prices, Girl Scout cookies are getting more  expensive. Although the sweets can be found for as little as $1.75 in some  areas, they sell for $2.75 a box in others. Prices are set by the 333 separate  councils to reflect concerns such as delivery costs in different parts of the  country.  </P> <P> The 10 councils in Southern California -- along with groups that serve the  greater New York, Atlanta, and Columbus, Ga., areas -- raised the cookie price  this year to $2.50 from $2. For Southern California, it is the first price hike  in nine years.  </P> <P>  -- Girl Scout councils throughout the country began experimenting with  telemarketing three years ago with mixed results, and the Angeles Council is  the first in the Southland to push organized telephone sales.  </P> <P> In Orange, San Diego and Imperial counties, girls have been encouraged for the  last five years to telephone friends and relatives in order to sell cookies.  But they have yet to reach out and touch strangers.  </P> <P> "The technique of just going around and knocking on doors is seen by parents as  being potentially dangerous and unproductive," said Cece Sander, director of  product sales for the Orange County Girl Scout Council. "So we do encourage  telephone sales . . . to friends and neighbors. The more we keep children away  from people they don't know, the more we like it."  </P> <P> Three years ago, the Northwest Georgia Girl Scout Council, which serves the  Atlanta area, had its first "cookie seminar" to introduce a telemarketing  program. The strategy was dreamed up by the Girl Scouts of the USA and its  cookie licensees.  </P> <P> Angela Fuller, one of the area's top cookie sellers, saw the benefits  immediately. When the 15-year-old from Acworth, Ga. was "a little girl," she  said, she could sell between 300 and 500 boxes by knocking on doors, manning  cookie booths in her community and roping in her parents for assistance.  </P> <P> Then she turned 13 and found the telephone. Like any seasoned telemarketer,  Angela relies heavily on a good customer list -- the membership directory of  the Mars Hill Presbyterian Church and her family's address book.  </P> <P> "There's about 300 members in my church," she says. "I get in contact with all  of them, plus about 50 family members. I'm the only kid in my family and my  parents work late, so I have the phone all to myself. . . . I try to leave two  weeks where I have no homework at all. I sit down from about 3:45 till about 6  and make phone calls."  </P> <P> At 13, she sold 1,400 boxes. At 14, she sold 1,600 boxes. At 15, she figures  she will sell only 700 or 800 boxes, but not for lack of trying. There are more  Girl Scouts in her church now, and the competition for sales to church members  is much stiffer.  </P> <P> In Tuskegee, Ala., Girl Scout Troop 188 went even farther afield than the local  church, literally tearing up the telephone directory and handing a chunk to  each scout. Sales went up, said Carolyn Bland, one of the troop's two leaders.  </P> <P> "We are a rural area, and a lot of the girls don't have a lot of neighbors,"  Bland said. "The main contacts are by telephone."  </P> <P> The Girl Scouts of Southwestern Connecticut had mixed luck when it ran a pilot  telemarketing project in 1989. In the rural community of Westin -- an area of  weekend homes and affluent families -- the participating troop sold 456 boxes  in six hours. But scouts in the city of Danbury sold a disappointing 91 boxes  in four hours, said Lois Fusco, the council's director of public relations and  product sales.  </P> <P> The problem was delivery. When Girl Scouts sell cookies over the phone, they  are not allowed to deliver them but must set up sites for customer pick-ups. In  the city, that system didn't work. But Fusco said the experiment was worthwhile  and will be repeated soon.  </P> <P> "More valuable than the number of boxes they sold was the confidence they  gained in using their telephone skills," Fusco said. "We saw the shyest girls  in our troop gain confidence. That's what the Girl Scout program is all about."  </P> <P> And training doesn't stop with the older girls. Although Brownies, Juniors and  Cadettes are not learning to sell by phone, they are being taught sophisticated  sales pitches and the means to deliver them so they can increase their sales at  the door or in booths throughout the community.  </P> <P> Nineteen girls from 5 to 12 years old were put through their paces Tuesday  afternoon at the Westmoreland Girl Scout Center in Los Angeles in preparation  for booth sales in the downtown area.  </P> <P> The girls split into small groups and pretended to sell to each other, with  designated customers and saleswomen. The first skit went something like this:  "We sell cookies." "Oh. How much are they?" "Two-fifty." "I want this one and  this one and this one."  </P> <P> So, they weren't a passel of little Cal Worthingtons, but it was a start. Then  it was Delmy Hernandez's turn.  </P> <P> "Would you like to buy some Girl Scout cookies?" the 11-year-old asked her awed  partner. "They are tasty and delicious. You will never find them in the store.  This is your last opportunity."  </P> <P> Give that girl a phone.  </P></p>

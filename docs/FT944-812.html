			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / BAT wins go-ahead for US tobacco deal BAT Industries, the UK tobacco and financial services group, has won US government approval for its planned Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) takeover of American Tobacco, the fifth-biggest US cigarette maker. The US Federal Trade Commission withdrew its opposition to the deal in exchange for undertakings that BAT would divest some of American Tobacco's minor brands in the next 12 months. The acquisition will take place immediately. The US brands that BAT will acquire are Lucky Strike, Pall Mall and Carlton in the premium sector and Misty, Private Stock and some private-label brands in the lower-priced segment. BAT will also get the rights to sell Silk Cut outside Europe. BAT said the acquisition would result in a restructuring charge of about Dollars 150m-Dollars 200m after-tax for the year just ending, but expected to derive efficiency savings of Dollars 200m a year by combining American Tobacco's headquarters and sales organisations with those of Brown &amp; Williamson, the US tobacco company it already owns. BAT agreed to buy American Tobacco from American Brands, its US parent, in April, but the FTC sought to block the bid on competition grounds. During a federal court hearing, the FTC argued that the US tobacco industry was already highly concentrated with only six participants. BAT countered that a merger of Brown &amp; Williamson with its 11 per cent market share and American Tobacco with its 7 per cent share would increase the combined company's ability to compete with Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds Tobacco, the two industry giants, which together account for 70 per cent of US cigarette sales. The eight-day court hearing ended last week, with the judge reserving his decision. FTC lawyers later acknowledged that the case had gone badly for them: but BAT was under pressure to do a deal with the FTC because of the risk that the commission would appeal against an unfavourable decision, further delaying the deal. Yesterday's out-of-court settlement requires BAT to divest Montclair, a low-priced brand, and certain minor discount brands within 12 months. The acquiring company will also be given the option of buying Tareyton, a premium brand. As a result of the divestitures, BAT's share of the US cigarette market will rise to 17 per cent instead of the 18 per cent originally envisaged.</p>

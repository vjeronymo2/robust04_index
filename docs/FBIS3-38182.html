			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Chris Parkin, PRESS ASSOCIATION] </F>   [Text] Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew  tonight highlighted the chance of a positive IRA-Sinn Fein  response to the Downing Street Ulster peace declaration.    Marking an apparent Government change of tone about the  prospects of hard-line Irish republican acceptance of the joint  Anglo-Irish statement, he spoke of "a rational ground" for hope  about the Provisionals' reaction. "We believe we may yet see a  positive response from the provisionals," he said. "Of course,  there is a rational ground for hope, because it is so much the  will of and demand of the people of this island, north and  south, that after all the declaration calls for nothing to be  given up by anybody -- apart from violence.    "It simply says that constitutional principles shall be  based  upon consent and agreement, and nobody is excluded from that  process, save and except those who hope to bring a bomb or a  bullet to fortify their arguments."    Pressure on Sinn Fein mounted today when the U.S. government  effectively refused party president Gerry Adams a visa to visit  a New York conference.    A statement in Washington said the White House would only  consider his application if he publicly renounced violence and  threw his support behind the Downing Street peace declaration.    At the same time, the first of four Sinn Fein "peace  commission" hearings to gauge reaction to the London-Dublin  statement within the republican movement was being held in  Londonderry.    Sir Patrick -- speaking after a meeting in Dublin of the  Anglo-Irish intergovernmental Northern Ireland Conference --  also appeared to offer greater scope than before for  clarification for the republicans of the December 15 document  signed by Prime Minister John Major and his Irish counterpart  Albert Reynolds.    "I am not aware of any particular part of the document that  we have been asked to clarify," he said. "I am not inviting a  request for clarification, but it so happens that nobody has  said `Look, we don't understand paragraph three,' which is quite  interesting."    Sir Patrick claimed that a letter sent by Mr Adams to Mr  Major amounted to a request for negotiation rather than  clarification. He emphasised: "We will continue to make clear  what the document does and does not do. We continue to make  speeches that do just that. I do not believe there is anything  between the two governments on this and I certainly don't wish  to see anybody under any genuine misapprehension as to what the  declaration says. What I am not prepared to do is to negotiate.  I am not prepared to unravel something that has taken as long  as this has to put together, and which is very clear and  comprehensive. I will not gloss it and say it means something  it does not say."    The conference meeting, initially set to end early this  afternoon, went on for more than six hours.    In a joint statement afterwards, Sir Patrick and joint  chairman Dick Spring, Ireland's deputy premier and foreign  minister, condemned recent violence in Ulster, and said a range  of issues had been reviewed.    Sir Patrick relayed British disappointment at the Irish  government's recent decision to scrap a 20-year-old ban on  broadcasting interviews with members of the IRA, Sinn Fein and  other groups with paramilitary links. A similar ban continues  to operate in the United Kingdom.    Both Sir Patrick and Mr Spring appeared to rule out setting  a  deadline for the IRA and Sinn Fein response to the Downing  Street declaration after today's talks.    The Ulster Secretary said: "There is no talk of deadlines.  The principles are not going to cease to apply come the end of  month one, two, three or five." And Irish Foreign Minister Mr  Spring added: "What we are trying to do is of such importance  that a deadline would not help."</p>

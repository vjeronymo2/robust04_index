			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / First fall for five years in graduate unemployment Graduate unemployment fell for the first time in five years last year, government figures show today. Six months after completion of courses, the proportion of graduates who had entered full-time employment rose from 43 per cent for the equivalent period in 1991-92 to 45 per cent, while the unemployment rate fell from 11.6 to 10.5 per cent. This was achieved in spite of continuing expansion in student and graduate numbers. Overall, the number of students graduating successfully from 'old' universities - excluding former polytechnics - last year rose 6 per cent to 87,073 compared with 1992. The number unemployed dropped from 7,832 to 7,472 - having been as low as 3,079 in 1989 - while the number in full-time employment rose almost 10 per cent from 29,199 to 31,949. However, the proportion of graduates choosing careers in industry reached an all-time low of 21 per cent. In the academic year 1982-83 the proportion was as high as 33 per cent. Most of the extra recruitment came in white-collar service industries, with commercial jobs accounting for 34 per cent of employed graduates, compared with 31 per cent the year before. According to the Universities Statistical Record, which produced the figures, heavier recruitment by advertising and market research agencies accounted for most of the rise. The immediate prospects for women remained much better than those for men, with an unemployment rate after six months of only 7.7 per cent. Male unemployment was 12.9 per cent. This was in spite of a much sharper increase in the number of women graduating - up 9 per cent, compared with 5 per cent for men. Male graduates still outnumbered women graduates by more than 20 per cent, although the evidence from admissions services is that this gap will continue to narrow next year. Figures for individual subjects will deepen government concern that university expansion has avoided the mathematical and scientific subjects it wants to encourage - the number of mathematics graduates increased just 1 per cent compared with 1991-92, while the numbers graduating in creative-arts subjects rose 11 per cent. They could add to suspicions voiced by Mr William Waldegrave, the science minister, that science degrees are unpopular because employers are not sending the right signals to the jobs market. After humanities graduates, on 13.5 per cent, unemployment rates were worst for mathematicians (13.4 per cent), engineers (12.7 per cent) and physicists (12.5 per cent).

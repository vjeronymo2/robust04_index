			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Fitzwilton buys Isosceles' N Irish arm for Pounds 122m ISOSCELES, the investment vehicle which owns the Gateway grocery group, has finally agreed the sale of its Northern Irish Wellworth subsidiary to a consortium headed by Fitzwilton for Pounds 122m in cash. The move represents a significant expansion for the Irish Fitzwilton group, which acts as a holding company for a variety of investments including the 9-store M6 cash and carry business in northern England. Mr Tony O'Reilly, the flamboyant Irish businessman who chairs Fitzwilton, said the acquisition represented 'a major opportunity to invest in a highly successful well-managed retail business' with great potential. 'The acquisition will transform Fitzwilton and is immediately earnings-enhancing for our shareholders,' he said. Fitzwilton will control 42.7 per cent of the acquired company while a group of institutional investors, headed by County NatWest Ventures, is taking a 54.3 per cent stake. The remaining 3 per cent will be held by Wellworth's management. Wellworth has 33 grocery outlets and 21.3 per cent of the food market in Northern Ireland with a staff of 4,450. It reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 18.6m on turnover of Pounds 236m for the year ending April 25, 1992. Isosceles will use most of the proceeds from the sale to reduce further its Pounds 1.26bn debt although about Pounds 30m will go to fund expansion of its upmarket Somerfield grocery chain. Isosceles has opened 60 Somerfield stores so far which are said to be trading 'slightly ahead of programme'. Last week, Isosceles announced it had an agreement with its bankers and investors and ruled out out the possibility of any immediate refinancing. But yesterday Mr Alistair Mitchell-Innes, Isosceles' chief executive, said the company's future financing needs would have to be reviewed in the light of trading conditions. 'The future is a long time away. A lot will depend on factors outside our knowledge or control,' he said. Isosceles had intended to float the Wellworth business but recent market uncertainty persuaded it that a trade sale was preferable. The City expected Wellworth to fetch between Pounds 100m and Pounds 150m. Mr Mitchell-Innes said Isosceles had been able to achieve a 'good price' representing a multiple of 10 times earnings. The company plans to sell its Herman's sporting goods subsidiary in the US. Fitzwilton results, Page 22; Lex, Page 20</p>

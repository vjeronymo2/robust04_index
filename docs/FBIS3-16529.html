It is  called Accord for the Sake of Russia [Soglsiye vo imiya Rossii].    Its main tasks are to avert the final disintegration of the  country, to halt the destruction of production capabilities, to  protect the market and the national capital, and to prevent  unemployment and hunger, allowing every citizen of the country  to live at a proper subsistence level and in a dignified way.    Dmitriy Pinsker, our parliamentary correspondent, has asked  the authors of today's appeal to the citizens of Russia to  explain what the new movement is about.    [Begin Pinsker recording] The future belongs to this  movement  -- it is a force which consolidates all patriotic parties and  associations, Anatoliy Lukyanov told a correspondent from Ekho  Moskvy. He stressed that he had taken part in the drafting of  the appeal, but does not see any necessity as yet to sign it.  Mikhail Lapshin, the leader of the Agrarian Party, thinks that  the creation of the Accord for the Sake of Russia is not a step  towards confrontation with the president but, on the contrary, a  desire to achieve civic accord.    It should be noted that Vasiliy Lipitskiy, whose name is  given as one of the founders, told an Ekho Moskvy correspondent  that it was the first time he heard of this movement, never mind  his participation in it. [end recording]    Let me add that today's appeal to the citizens of Russia has  been signed by Valeriy Zorkin, Gennadiy Zyuganov, Sergey  Baburin, Aleksandr Prokhanov, Aleksandr Tsypko, Nikita  Mikhalkov, and a number of others.</p>

			<p><P> September 27, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ENTERTAINMENT;  </P> <P> UNION DIGS IN, NEWTON CROSSES LINE  </P> <P> Entertainer Wayne Newton, who gave up $500,000 in performance fees while trying  to resolve a summer-long strike by musicians, returned to the stage Tuesday  night while pickets marched outside.  </P> <P> Newton performed for a cheering sellout crowd of 1,700 at the Las Vegas Hilton  where he earns $250,000 a week. The return by the city's leading attraction was  seen as a major break in a strike by musicians against five Las Vegas resorts.  </P> <P> The return of Newton was seen as a signal that other musicians who have honored  the picket lines over the last four months might also return to the city's  showrooms.  </P> <P> The popular singer had been instrumental in setting up several meetings with  resort owners and union leaders while he refused to cross the lines during the  last two weeks. But he returned to the stage hours after a union leader called  a "final offer" by hotel management "a piece of garbage."  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 13, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> UTILITY MERGER ANTITRUST ISSUE SAID RESOLVED;  </P> <P> ENERGY: THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT REPORTEDLY HAS REACHED AGREEMENT WITH SDG&amp;E  AND EDISON OVER ANTITRUST ISSUES RAISED BY THE PROPOSED MERGER.  </P> <P> The U.S. Department of Justice has reached an agreement with Southern  California Edison and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric that "adequately resolves"  antitrust issues generated by the utilities' proposed merger, Edison Executive  Vice President John E. Bryson said Tuesday.  </P> <P> A Justice Department spokesman was not available late Tuesday for comment on  the agreement, but Bryson said that with the negotiated settlement in place,  "the Justice Department's antitrust division no longer has any concerns" about  the proposed merger's impact on utility competition in Southern California and  the West.  </P> <P> "These conditions adequately resolve any concerns they might have had about  competition," Bryson said.  </P> <P> The agreement was hammered out during negotiations that began in April, shortly  after the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission completed fact-finding hearings  on the proposed merger, Bryson said. While the Justice Department did not take  a formal position on the merger during those hearings, its antitrust division  subsequently raised anti-competition concerns, Bryson said.  </P> <P> It was uncertain Tuesday afternoon whether the agreement would eliminate  antitrust and anti-competition objections raised by state Atty. Gen. John Van  de Kamp and state Public Utilities Commission staff members.  </P> <P> "If this is indeed the case, then as we've said before, (Edison Chairman)  Howard Allen has friends in high places," San Diego Mayor Maureen O'Connor, who  had not yet seen the agreement, said.  </P> <P> Van de Kamp also had not yet seen the final agreement reached by the Justice  Department and the utilities, but "we were sufficiently concerned with a  previous version that Van de Kamp personally contacted the head of the Justice  Department's antitrust division," Special Assistant Atty. Gen. Mike Strumwasser  said Tuesday. Van de Kamp "spent an hour on the telephone . . . telling him why  (the department) doesn't seem to understand this case very well," Strumwasser  said.  </P> <P> Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers Action Network, a  San Diego-based consumer group, described the agreement as "a step in the right  direction" because "it's Edison's first concession that there would indeed be  anti-competitive problems associated with the merger. . . . But I don't think  the conditions are going to appease the state attorney general, the PUC's  Division of Ratepayer Advocates or the utilities in this region."  </P> <P> Bryson, however, maintained that the Justice Department agreement would "refine  and advance the pro-competitive elements of this merger (as described in) our  initial filings with" federal and state regulators.  </P> <P> The Justice Department will file its official version of the agreement with the  FERC later this week, Edison spokesman Lew Phelps said. Justice Department  officials believe that the conditions in the agreement "adequately resolve any  concerns" about antitrust and anti-competition issues, he said. "The adequately  resolve phrase is language that they have specifically authorized us to use in  our FERC filings."  </P> <P> The agreement reached would force the merged companies to give other utilities  limited access to the extensive web of transmission lines that Edison and  SDG&amp;E own in California and the West should federal and state officials  approve the $1.5-billion stock-swap merger.  </P> <P> The combined companies' transmission grid would play a vital role for utilities  that hope to buy and sell -- and then transmit -- electrical power that is  generated at coal-fired plants in the Southwest and hydropower plants in the  Northwest.  </P> <P> Under the agreement reached Tuesday, utilities would compete for available  transmission space on the combined utility companies' transmission lines  through a bidding system designed in part by a Justice Department economist,  Bryson said.  </P> <P> Edison and a group of municipally owned electric utilities in cities such as  Orange, Anaheim and Colton have been feuding about transmission access for more  than 20 years. Strumwasser on Tuesday suggested that it would be difficult for  the Justice Department's agreement to solve that longstanding argument.  </P></p>

			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / ERM does not need reform, say central bankers THE EUROPEAN exchange rate mechanism is not in need of fundamental reform, according to senior EC central bankers. Instead, they believe members of the European monetary system should pay more attention to the existing rules - particularly those which allow more frequent adjustments of European exchange rates within the ERM. The EC's monetary committee, which meets today in Brussels, is in the final stages of preparing a report on the workings of the ERM, to be submitted to finance ministers at their informal meeting in Denmark on May 22. The monetary experts' report could reignite the debate which raged in Europe in the aftermath of the September foreign exchange crisis. Since then, finance ministers, preoccupied with talks about how to encourage EC economic growth, have left the technicians to their work. But there is still a strong undercurrent of political concern about the risk of 'competitive devaluation' of EC currencies, and the need for greater co-ordination between Germany and other Community members on interest rate policy. The monetary committee of senior central bank and treasury officials, together with the European Commission and the committee of EC central bank governors, is examining what went wrong last September when currency turmoil forced the lira and sterling out of the ERM. Since then, Spain, Portugal and Ireland have had to devalue their currencies to stay within the ERM. At the time, Mr John Major, the prime minister, blamed 'fault-lines' in the ERM for the problems, and called for its reform. But central bankers say there has been little serious talk of reform at their meetings. The secretive monetary committee, which is unlikely to publish its analysis and recommendations, is believed to oppose significant changes. Mr Alfons Verplaetse, governor of the Belgian central bank, said: 'The lessons from the turmoil are very clear. I think there will be very little formal change to the rules. The solution will probably be a more rational and better implementation of existing rules. You can do a lot within the formal framework.' Another senior central banker said: 'One of the basic rules of the system is that rates are fixed - but adjustable.' Early action to adjust rates would have deterred currency speculation, he added, by reducing tensions in the system. But ahead of the crisis 'the possibility of making adjustments was simply ruled out for political reasons'. According to the same senior central bank official, too many governments have viewed the ERM as a precursor of European economic and monetary union. Meanwhile, the recent calm in the ERM should help France to make a symbolic cut in the least important of its two official interest rates in the next few days.

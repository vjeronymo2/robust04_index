			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kiev, 4 Feb -- Ukraine's Foreign Affairs Minister  Anatoliy Zlenko spoke at a news conference in the Foreign  Affairs Ministry on the attitude of the world community to the  trilateral agreement on nuclear disarmament signed in Moscow.  This attitude, he said, was absolutely positive, showing the  world community's appreciation of the historic step taken by  Ukraine. The minister noted that the resolution adopted by the  Supreme Council of Ukraine yesterday [3 February] was especially  significant, in that the Supreme Council appreciated the steps  made by the president and the government to follow the Supreme  Council's recommendations contained in the 18 November 1993  resolution.    "It is worth stressing," Anatoliy Zlenko said, "that the  Supreme Council, having withdrawn its reservations on Article 5  of the Lisbon Protocol, thus confirmed Ukraine's intention to  join the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] as soon as  possible, as a state that does not possess nuclear arms. This  way, failure to make a decision on joining the NPT should not be  regarded as the Supreme Council's negative stand on the treaty,  but only as the Supreme Council's intention to examine this  issue at a separate Supreme Council session."    The minister then said that the Supreme Council's decision  clears the way for exchanging instruments of ratification and  thus completing the process of the ratification of the START  Treaty.    Anatoliy Zlenko told journalists that bilateral and  trilateral talks between experts will be held in the near future  with regard to the practical implementation of the principles  laid down in the trilateral statement and its appendix signed on  14 January in Moscow. In the minister's view, the Supreme  Council's decision makes it possible to speed up talks with  international financial organizations, the European Union, and  the leading Western states on the granting of effective aid to  Ukraine for its economic reform.    In reply to journalists' questions, the foreign minister  said  that only three nuclear warheads had been transferred from  Ukraine to Russia so far, due to their unsatisfactory technical  condition.</p>

"Democracy is only applied when it is convenient to serving  certain parties' interests, said Deputy 'Abd-al-'Aziz Jabr  (Amman First district), who charged that some of the issues  raised by lawmakers in the form of questions to the government  were disregarded during the House's first ordinary session which  ended last week.    The IAF deputy told the JORDAN TIMES that some of the  "sensitive issues" addressed by deputies were deliberately  ignored by Mr. al-Masri who, he said, has failed to present them  to the government.    Mr. Jabr said he had questioned the government on why it had  allowed 30 Jews into Jordan, but denied entry to two prominent  Egyptian Islamists. He said Mr. al-Masri did not pass his  question on to the government.    The deputy also accused Mr. al-Masri of "overlooking" an IAF  legislators' bid to introduce a law banning the consumption of  alcohol in the country. A draft law on alcohol consumption has  been presented by the government to the House, which referred it  to its Parliamentary Committee.    Parliamentary sources told the JORDAN TIMES the House has  decided to "sit on the legislation" to avoid the controversy the  draft legislation is expected to raise.    The draft law puts some restrictions on the sale of alcohol,  but does not ban its consumption in the Kingdom.    The IAF wants alcohol prohibited in accordance with Islamic  Sharia and is expected to use religious clauses clearly  forbidding the use of alcohol by Muslims to embarrass deputies  who would not support its bid.    Other members of the House shared Mr. Jabr's discontent with  Mr. al-Masri's "casual brushing" off of their questions and had  demanded that all their queries be answered by the government in  the House's last meeting on March 22.    But that could not be done and many questions went  unanswered  by the government, Mr. Jabr said.    During one of the last sessions of the House, several IAF  deputies told Mr. al-Masri that he had nothing to "fear" in  presenting deputies' inquiries to the government as it would be  "pleased" to respond to all inquiries, some of which may be "too  important" to leave unanswered.    Mr. al-Masri, however, dismissed the deputies' accusations,  saying that these measures had to be taken because of the "lack  of time," and that new arrangements would be made to accommodate  deputies' requirements.    The disregard for democracy began long before this House  convened in November last year, Mr. Jabr charged. He said it  began when the government unilaterally introduced the one-person  one-vote formula into the Election Law, which the Islamists and  many other parties opposed.    Mr. Jabr added that deputies have demanded to be presented  with a new draft election law of what he termed was of a more  democratic nature, to be discussed in their extraordinary  session which, parliamentary sources said, is expected to  convene next month.</p>

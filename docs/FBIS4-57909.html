			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 19 May (PL) -- Official actions against  those who have enriched themselves illicitly will be taken  seriously and calmly, with emphasis on those who improperly took  advantage of state goods, a top leader of the Communist Party of  Cuba [PCC] said today.    During a meeting with the Veterans Association, Candido  Palmero, first secretary of the PCC in the agricultural province  of Havana, said several cases have been uncovered. Greater  emphasis will be placed on those who enriched themselves at the  expense of the state.    Explaining the need for Decree Law 149, Palmero noted that  the struggle against impunity has become a task of the people  and it will not be implemented in haste.    Referrring to cases of illicit enrichment already uncovered,  he cited the case of a citizen whose eight different kinds of  transportation and a large amount of money were confiscated.    Decree Law 149, promulgated by the executive at the request  of the Cuban assembly, is among the first official actions  against the so-called money hoarders, individuals who outrage  the citizens because of their accumulation of resources obtained  in a questionable manner.    The need to adopt measures against these individuals was a  continuous proposal during the workers' assemblies, meetings  held in all work places in the country in the early months of  1994.    Palmero noted that it is the people who have complained  about  those who, according to Havana's newspaper TRIBUNA, "filled  their coffers through speculation, theft, and shady deals."</p>

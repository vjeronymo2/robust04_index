			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Socialists Sacrifice Their </F> Positions. For the Sake of the State"]    [Text] At the news conference in Kiev, leaders of  Ukraine's Socialist Party were not as confident as Communists,  but they did not look too depressed either, as, according to  them, they had received 15 mandates in the parliament. Moreover,  leader of Ukraine's Socialist Party and twice [dvichi] deputy O.  Moroz stated that the party had been faced with two variants of  choosing their further fate. First, a variant that would be  advantageous for the party, which does not have a single  representative in the power structures and may, therefore,  quietly assume tough opposition to the present authorities that  have nothing much to be proud of. However, the Fourth  Extraordinary Congress of Ukraine's Socialist Party voted for  the other unremunerative variant in accordance with which the  party, for the sake of building the state and preventing the  economic collapse, will seek contacts with all political forces  capable of constructive compromise.    In O. Moroz's opinion, the main result of the elections is  an  open regionalization of our society in terms of political  convictions: The west -- in favor of Nationalists and National  Democrats; and the east, center, and south -- mainly supporting  left-wingers. "Not a single presidential candidate can bring  all of these moods to agreement," said O. Moroz and acknowledged  the fact that National Democrats (Rukh [Ukraine's People's  Movement for Perestroyka] and the Ukrainian Republican Party)  are also worried by the radicalization of the right-wing center.  O. Moroz tactfully failed to note that the same had happened to  the left-wing center. Nominated as a presidential candidate, O.  Moroz openly said this about his goals: "If we win, we will  implement the program of the Socialist Party. We will build an  independent and strong democratic state with a socially oriented  economy. We will build a people's democratic republic." He  also pointed out that Socialists were not against privatization  in general, but that they protested against its today's  antipeople variant, which does not promote economic efficiency,  but enriches a small group of dodgers.</p>

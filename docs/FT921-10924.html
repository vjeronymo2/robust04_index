			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Court forbids release of Pounds 6m in PPI-frozen account THE CENTRAL bank of the internationally unrecognised Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus yesterday lost an Appeal Court battle to be allowed to take Pounds 6m spending money from Pounds 23m frozen in its main UK account. The freezing order was imposed in October at the request of the administrators of Polly Peck International, the fruit and electronics group, who are seeking to recover funds allegedly improperly removed from the company. Yesterday's appeal was against a High Court ruling on January 14 by Mr Justice Harman, refusing leave to take out more funds. The bank argued that it was unable to discharge its obligations because of the freeze on its funds in the UK. Lord Justice Parker, sitting with Lord Justice Stocker and Sir David Croom-Johnson, said that it was plain that, since October, the bank had operated its account so as to defeat the protection given to the Polly Peck administrators and remove assets covered by the freezing order. The bank was ordered to pay the administrators' costs incurred in opposing the appeal.</p>

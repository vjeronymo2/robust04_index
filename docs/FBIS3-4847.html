Japanese Ambassador to Ukraine Shoji Suezawa signed the  agreement with Ukraine Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko, the  ministry said.    The committee will include representatives of the  Governments  of Japan and Ukraine, it said.    The accord follows Japan's announcement in April last year  at  a ministerial meeting of the Group of Seven (G-7) nations that  it would extend a grant-in-aid of 100 million dollars for the  promotion of nuclear weapons destruction in the former Soviet  Union.    Ukraine is one of the four former Soviet republics that  inherited nuclear weapons when the Soviet Union broke up in 1991.    Japan signed a similar accord on cooperation on nuclear  nonproliferation with Belarus in November. Japan has yet to  sign an agreement with Kazakhstan.    In January, U.S. President Bill Clinton, Russian President  Boris Yeltsin and Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk agreed to  scrap Ukraine's 176 intercontinental ballistic missiles and  1,800 warheads.</p>

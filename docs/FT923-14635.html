			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Diamond sales depressed 'but outlook brightening' DIAMOND SALES remained severely depressed in the first half of this year but the outlook was brightening and the industry had its stock levels and bank borrowing under firm control. That was the message yesterday from the Central Selling Organisation through which De Beers of South Africa controls 80 per cent of world rough (uncut) diamond trade. The CSO's sales dropped 14 per cent in the half-year compared with the same months of 1991 to USDollars 1.787bn. Sales were nearly 28 per cent below the peak of Dollars 2.477bn seen in the first half of 1990 and at their lowest since the first six months of 1987. In volume terms the fall was much steeper because there were price increases in March 1989 (15.5 per cent) and 1990 (5.5 per cent). Also the first half of last year was badly affected by the Gulf war, which cut sales to Israel, and by the Indian cutting houses being unable to pay for diamonds because of that country's temporary foreign exchange crisis. The first-half fall was in line with a forecast made by Mr Julian Ogilvie Thompson, De Beers' chairman, in April when he predicted a 15 per cent drop. The CSO said yesterday Mr Ogilvie Thompson still expected second-half sales to be better than the Dollars 1.843bn achieved in July-December 1991. Mr Michael Spriggs, analyst at the SG Warburg financial services group, suggested that the CSO sales 'look surprisingly good, given the state of the world economy'. The CSO said it restricted sales to clients in the early part of 1992 to stabilise the market. There were now 'encouraging' signs in the US retail diamond jewellery market but Japan was looking weaker. Each market accounts for about 30 per cent of diamond jewellery retail sales. European jewellery sales were unchanged. Recovery might be slowed, however, by the impact on market sentiment of smuggling from Angola. The CSO estimated that the unofficial flow of rough diamonds from Angola was running at an annual Dollars 400m. Most were ending up in Antwerp where the CSO was doing its best to mop them up to add to its steadily-increasing stockpile.</p>

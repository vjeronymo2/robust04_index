			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Moscow NTV in Russian at 1700 GMT on 12  June broadcasts a three-minute report by correspondent Aleksandr  Skachenko on the upcoming elections, including an interview with  Leonid Kuchma, former Ukrainian prime minister.    Skachenko begins his report by saying that the main battle  is  being waged in the press, where the current president, Leonid  Kravchuk, is leading. Polls have revealed that there are three  main contenders to the post--Leonid Kravchuk, Leonid Kuchma, and  Aleksandr Moroz, leader of the Socialist Party and parliamentary  speaker.    Skachenko asks Kuchma the following question: Support given  to you by western and eastern regions is totally different. Are  you not afraid that your election to the post of the president  will only increase confrontation between western and eastern  regions of the country?    Kuchma replies: "I do not want to think about it because I  think that in any situation, especially in a situation as  crucial as this, we need to look for things to unite us. The  economy and, naturally, the construction of a sovereign,  independent, and democratic state ought to become our uniting  factors. I am deeply convinced that only then will Ukraine be  able to hope that life will be better, as they say, tomorrow.  The economy will put everything in its place and this  confrontation will exist no more."    Skachenko then says that Leonid Kuchma became head of the  coalition government in October 1992 as a result of yet another  political crisis. His team tried to implement market reforms  and unsuccessfully fought against corruption. Market reforms  died down by the spring of 1992 because of constant  disagreements between the government and parliament. Opponents  accused Kuchma of being too fond of Russia, of lacking strong  will power and a united team. Kuchma resigned in the autumn of  1993 but did not lose his popularity. He is especially popular  with the Russian-speaking population in southern and eastern  parts of Ukraine.    Asked about the possibility of Ukraine joining a new union  with Russia, Kuchma says: "I do not know. But you know I am not  used to being a slave. I am used to being a master and I want  to be a master in my country, without anyone above me. I am  really not used to it."</p>

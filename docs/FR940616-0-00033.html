By amending &sect;214.103 to revise paragraphs (b) and (c) to read as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;214.103 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Fall protection, generally. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * * <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (b)(1) This section shall not apply if the installation of the fall arrest system poses a greater exposure to risk than the work to be performed. In any action brought by FRA to enforce the fall protection requirements, the railroad or railroad contractor shall have the burden of proving that the installation of such device poses greater exposure to risk than performance of the work itself. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) This section shall not apply to employees engaged in inspection of railroad bridges conducted in full compliance with the following conditions: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) the railroad or railroad contractor has a written program in place that requires training in, adherence to, and use of safe procedures associated with climbing techniques and procedures to be used; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) the employee to whom this exception applies has been trained and qualified according to that program to perform bridge inspections, has been previously and voluntarily designated to perform inspections under the provisions of that program, and has accepted the designation; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) the employee to whom this exception applies is familiar with the appropriate climbing techniques associated with all bridge structures the employee is responsible for inspecting; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) the employee to whom this exception applies is engaged solely in moving on or about the bridge or observing, measuring, and recording the dimensions and condition of the bridge and its components; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) the employee to whom this exception applies is provided all equipment necessary to meet the needs of safety, including any specialized or alternative systems required. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) This section shall not apply where employees are working on a railroad bridge equipped with walkways and railings of sufficient height, width, and strength to prevent a fall, provided that the employee does not work beyond the railings, over the side of the bridge, on ladders or other elevation devices, or where gaps or holes exist through which a body could fall. Where used in place of fall protection as provided for in &sect;214.105, this paragraph (c) is satisfied by: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Walkways and railings meeting the standards set forth in the American Railway Engineering Association's Manual for Railway Engineering; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Roadways attached to railroad bridges, provided that employees on the roadway deck work or move at a distance of six feet or more from the edge of the roadway deck, or from an opening through which a person could fall. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * * <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 3.

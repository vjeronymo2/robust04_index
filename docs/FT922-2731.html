			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / ILO alarmed at unemployment in West Bank and Gaza UNEMPLOYMENT and underemployment in the West Bank and Gaza Strip have reached 'alarming proportions' and the general economic situation has deteriorated markedly since the Gulf War early last year, according to a report by the International Labour Organisation (ILO). Unemployment in the West Bank is officially estimated to have risen to more than 10 per cent by end-1991 from 3.6 per cent a year earlier. But the United Nations body says unofficial estimates put unemployment in the occupied territories at anywhere between 25 and 40 per cent of the 320,000-strong labour force. The report, compiled before the latest clampdown in Gaza, amounts to a scathing indictment of Israel's economic exploitation of the territories to its own advantage, from the destruction of Arab lands and property to make way for Jewish settlements to employment of Palestinians as cheap labour and restrictions on Palestinian economic development. Per capita incomes in the occupied Arab lands are only one-fifth Israeli levels. Over 120,000 Palestinian workers - more than one third of the labour force in the occupied territories - commute to jobs in Israel, mostly in construction. All are employed on a daily basis, without job security or the social benefits enjoyed by Israeli workers, the ILO points out. During the Gulf war, many Palestinian workers, some of long standing, were summarily dismissed, often without compensation and sometimes without the wages due to them.

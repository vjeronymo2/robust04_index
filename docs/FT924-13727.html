			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Attempt to gain access to Polly Peck assets ADMINISTRATORS to Polly Peck International, the collapsed fruit and electronics group, are due to meet tomorrow with Mr Mentes Aziz, the personal lawyer of Mr Asil Nadir, the former chairman, in a bid to gain access to the assets still held in companies in the north of Cyprus. Mr Aziz confirmed he was in negotiations with Mr Richard Stone and Mr Michael Jordan of Coopers Lybrand following earlier meetings in Istanbul last week. He is also due to meet the Serious Fraud Office on Friday. On September 23 Mr Aziz appeared before Ms Laura Harris, the SFO director, and was issued with a 'Section 2' which requires a suspect to answer questions. Since the PPI collapse in October 1990, Mr Aziz has taken legal action in the Cypriot courts to prevent the administrators from gaining control of PPI assets on the island - Unipac, a packaging company in Famagusta, and Sunzest Trading, a fruit export concern. Mr Aziz said he was now discussing an amicable resolution of the dispute. However he wanted a formal undertaking from the administrators that the Cypriot companies would not be closed. 'Whether the companies are going to be disposed of, or retained, the interests of the company and the community must be taken into account,' he said.</p>

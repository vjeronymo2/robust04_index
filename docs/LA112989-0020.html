			<p><P> November 29, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A COTTONSEED ATTACK  </P> <P> Question: I've gotten into the habit of reading labels on food products, not  because I'm trying to avoid sugar or salt or cholesterol, but because I'm  worried about having an allergy attack.  </P> <P> I've been told that I'm allergic to cottonseed and that I should be careful of  this, particularly when I buy candy. What puzzles me is that I've used  cottonseed oil, and it has never caused me any problems. Why can I use the oil  but not the meal?  </P> <P> Answer: Cottonseed meal can produce an allergic reaction in susceptible  individuals. The product does not appear to be widely used, but it can be found  in candy and baked goods. However, cottonseed oil does not affect people the  same way, even those who are sensitive to the seeds.  </P></p>

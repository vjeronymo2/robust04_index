			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] MAINICHI SHIMBUN conducted an emergency opinion  poll by phone at the end of January. Regarding the  participation of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ],  the largest ruling party, in the coalition government, 31  percent of respondents said: "Its participation is desirable";  24 percent said: "It is better for the SDPJ not to  participate"; and 44 percent said: "It is hard to say."    It was a shock to the SDPJ that an accord was reached on  opening Japan's rice market at the Uruguay Round talks. The  party has become divided on the passage of the political reform  bills, and it has been questioned as to whether the party should  remain in the coalition. Moreover, the party will be asked to  undergo a "test for loyalty" in dealing with the issue of  raising the consumption tax rate. However, the number of  respondents favoring "the SDPJ's participation in the coalition"  exceeds that of respondents opposing it. And yet, when a poll  was held immediately following the coalition government's  inauguration last August, 44 percent of respondents favored its  participation while 11 percent opposed it. Therefore, when these  results are compared with those of the current poll, the number  of those who favor the participation has dropped by a large  margin while that of those who oppose it has increased.    A large number of those who support various ruling coalition  parties favor the SDPJ's participation in the coalition. In  particular, 59 percent of those who support the SDPJ favors its  participation while only 16 percent favors its secession from  the coalition. On the other hand, 23 percent of those who  support the Liberal Democratic Party favors the SDPJ's  participation while 37 percent opposes it. As for Japan  Communist Party supporters, 26 percent favors its participation  and 57 percent opposes it. Of those who support the Hosokawa  cabinet, 36 percent favors its participation while 22 percent is  against it. Of those who answered that it is "desirable" to  have the passage of the political reform bills, 34 percent  supports its participation while 24 percent does not. As for  those who answered it was "undesirable," 24 percent supports its  participation while 29 percent is opposed. This survey was  conducted by phone on 30 January to obtain answers from 1,000  eligible voters throughout the country.    With regard to this survey's results, SDPJ Chairman Tomiichi  Murayama said: "It reflects that the party has been forced to  make an agonized choice." However, he also stated: "We are not  trying to adversely influence the administration, but we must  have our party's view reflected in the administration's policy."</p>

			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Interest cut aids Derwent Valley After reduced interest pay-able, Derwent Valley Holdings, the property group, raised pre-tax profit from Pounds 425,000 to Pounds 603,000 in the first half of 1992. Despite the loss of income from the sale of a property in the second half of 1991 and a refurbishment, gross income remained virtually unchanged at Pounds 3.82m (Pounds 3.81m). Future opportunities for improvement of the port-folio had been pursued des-pite the conditions in the market. Interest charges this time were Pounds 1.58m (Pounds 1.75m). Earnings per share came to 5.2p (3p) and the interim dividend is again 2.9p.</p>

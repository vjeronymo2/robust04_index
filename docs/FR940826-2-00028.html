			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On May 5, 1993, the Secretary of Energy announced a number of safety and health initiatives stressing the need for the Department to operate on a par with private industry in the safety and health arena. One of those initiatives involved the commencement of consultations with OSHA with the aim of establishing OSHA regulation of all DOE facilities. The Secretary recognized, however, that OSHA is not now ready to undertake regulation of DOE activities, and in light of the significant issues that must be addressed prior to the implementation of OSHA jurisdiction, the Department anticipates that a transition period of three to five years is necessary. Nonetheless, the Department is currently obligated to implement the enforcement authority of section 3131(b) of the Act, and intends to do so as an interim measure pending the transition to OSHA jurisdiction. The Department believes that implementation of this enforcement authority during the transition period will help to ensure that the training requirements for contractor employees are met. DOE invites the public to comment on its plans to implement its enforcement authority pursuant to section 3131(b) of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Background and Legislative History  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 3131 of the Act contains two substantive provisions aimed at addressing the concern of Congress regarding the adequacy of worker safety training for employees handling hazardous substances, and responding to emergencies involving hazardous substances, at the nation's nuclear weapons facilities. Subsection (a) authorizes the Secretary to award grants to nonprofit organizations that have demonstrated (as determined by the Secretary) capabilities in providing safety and health training and in involving, in training, groups of workers whose duties include hazardous substance response or emergency response. The Secretary is required to give preference to employee organizations and joint labor-management training programs that are grant recipients under section 126(g) of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986, 42 U.S.C. 9660a, a program administered by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS). The Department has entered into an agreement with NIEHS to award and administer the grants provided under section 3131(a) of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 3131(b), the subject of this notice, provides that the Secretary shall assess civil penalties of up to $5,000 per day against any DOE contractor who, as determined by the Secretary, fails to provide training for employees engaged in hazardous substance response or emergency response, or who fails to certify to the Department that its employees are adequately trained for such response pursuant to DOE orders relating to employee safety training. Because of this statutory mandate, DOE does not intend to consider a reduction in contractor award fees in lieu of payment of civil penalties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary is required by section 3131(c) to prescribe regulations for the implementation of these requirements. The Department intends to proceed with rulemaking after completion of its review of the comments and materials received in response to this Notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 3131(d) provides that the term ``hazardous substance'' includes both radioactive waste and mixed radioactive and hazardous waste. The Department intends also to cover substances identified within the definition of hazardous substance in section 101(14) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) (42 U.S.C. 9601.101(14)). The statute does not define the term ``nuclear weapons facility.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Certification of Training  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 3131 places on the contractor the burden of conducting required training, certifying the completion of such training, and keeping records to document that the training requirement has been satisfied. In developing its implementing regulations, DOE is particularly interested in receiving comments on the following matters:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1_DOE intends to make contractors responsible for maintaining all documentation related to the hazardous substance and emergency response training of their work force. DOE will consider what, if any, data should be kept, and in what format. DOE's goal will be to provide easy review for DOE field inspectors while minimizing the burden on contractors. DOE also is considering requiring a wallet-sized photo identification card for each trained employee that would contain, among other things, the date of refresher training, giving DOE the opportunity to document training in the field.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2_Section 3131 permits DOE contractors to certify that employees have been adequately trained and do not need additional training. DOE seeks comment on the most effective and efficient way for the employer to certify that employees are adequately trained especially in those cases where the employer does not actually provide the training.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3_One objective of section 3131(b) is to ensure that all employees who are, or may be, engaged in hazardous substance response or emergency response at the Department's nuclear weapons facilities receive adequate safety training. DOE has the further objective of ensuring that any enforcement program is structured to provide appropriate incentives for DOE contractors to comply with DOE requirements applicable to this training, including self-identification, reporting, and prompt correction of deficiencies. Comments are requested on these objectives and on ways to achieve these objectives in an effective and efficient manner for both DOE and its contractors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

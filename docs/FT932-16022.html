			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Danes call for EC energy tax moves DENMARK is pressing for the European Community to take a political decision to move forward with a carbon tax in June, before the end of its six-month presidency, writes George Graham in Washington. Mr Svend Auken, Denmark's environment minister, said the new US administration's decision to levy an additional tax on energy offered 'a unique chance to speed things up' in the effort to reduce global carbon dioxide emissions. EC officials acknowledge, however, that they are unlikely to persuade Britain to go along with the energy tax, and are looking for a declaration of principle, with details to be worked out later. Six countries - Germany, Italy, Denmark, Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands - have backed the proposed carbon tax, while France, Portugal, Greece and Ireland have expressed concerns about how the burden will be shared. Only Spain and the UK are firmly opposed to it. EC officials said, however, that they believed Spain could be won over.</p>

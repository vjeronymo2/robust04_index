			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Texaco condemns N Sea tax changes TEXACO yesterday added its weight to the lobby against the government's proposed Budget changes to North Sea taxes. Mr Don Bennett, managing director of the US oil company's UK arm, said in a letter to MPs that amendments to the changes suggested by the Treasury last week were unnecessarily expensive and would not have the desired effect of saving jobs in the service sector. The letter came as the committee of MPs scrutinising the Finance Bill - which implements the Budget - prepared to debate the government's changes to petroleum revenue taxes today. The government has proposed cutting the PRT rate from 75 per cent to 50 per cent and abolishing tax relief on exploration work. Last week the Treasury suggested an amendment providing short-term aid for companies worst affected by the changes. British Petroleum, Shell and other large oil companies have supported the PRT changes. But Texaco said the changes would 'by discouraging the level of exploration in the next few years, have a serious effect on the jobs in the dynamic service sector which provides the key support services to the oil companies'. Texaco, with the Association of Service Sector Oil-Related Companies, supports an amendment by Mr John Watts, a member of the committee scrutinising the bill, to phase in the PRT changes over three years with a corresponding phased reduction in tax relief on exploration and appraisal activity.</p>

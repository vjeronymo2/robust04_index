			<p><P> January 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS  </P> <P> Caterpillar Inc.'s earnings slipped 4% in the fourth quarter to $163 million  despite better sales, but it still managed to earn a record profit for the full  year. Even with the dip in quarterly profit, Caterpillar said 1988 profit was a  record $616 million, up from $350 million in 1987. The Peoria, Ill.-based  heavy-machinery manufacturer said higher costs in the fourth quarter came from  a new labor contract, higher employment, factory modernization investment and  more expensive materials. During the final quarter, revenue rose 17% to $2.66  billion. For the year, Caterpillar said annual sales rose to $10.43 billion  from $8.18 billion in 1987.  </P> <P> Tables, Page 6  </P></p>

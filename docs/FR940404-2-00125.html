PMLIC is a mutual life insurance company chartered under Pennsylvania law and authorized to transact life and annuity business in all states and the District of Columbia. PLACA, a stock life insurance company chartered under Delaware law and authorized to transact life insurance and annuity business in the District of Columbia and all states other than New York and Maine, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of PMLIC. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. PML Securities, a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of PMLIC, is registered with the Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a broker-dealer, and is a member of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. PML Securities will serve as the distributor and principal underwriter for the Contracts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The PLACA Account was established by PLACA as a separate investment account under Delaware insurance law on January 6, 1994, as a funding medium for variable annuity contracts. The PMLIC Account was established by PMLIC as a separate investment account under Pennsylvania insurance law on January 4, 1994, as a funding vehicle for variable annuity contracts. Initially, the PLACA and PMLIC Accounts each will consist of five subaccounts: Equity, Small Cap, Managed, Bond, and Money Market (collectively, the ``Subaccounts,'' individually, the ``Subaccount''). The PLACA Account and the PMLIC Account each will be registered under the 1940 Act as a unit investment trust. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Each Subaccount will invest exclusively in the shares of a designated investment portfolio of the Quest for Value Accumulation Trust (the ``Fund''). In the future, PMLIC and PLACA may establish other subaccounts which will invest in specified portfolios of the Fund or other investment funds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The Contracts may be purchased on a non-tax qualified basis (``Nonqualified Contracts'') or they may be purchased and used in connection with qualified retirement plans or as individual retirement annuities that quality for favorable federal income tax treatment (``Qualified Contracts''). The Contracts require a minimum initial premium payment of at least $2,000. Subsequent premium payments must be a least $100 for Nonqualified Contracts, and $50 for Qualified Contracts. The Contract owner may allocate premium payments to one or more Subaccounts, each of which will invest in a corresponding portfolio of the Fund. Premium payments will be credited with the investment experience of the appropriate Subaccount(s). The Contract owner also may allocate premium payments to the PLACA guaranteed account or the PMLIC guaranteed account, depending upon which company issues the Contract, and such payments will be credited with interest as provided for in the Contracts. (The guaranteed accounts of PLACA and PMLIC are part of those companies' respective general accounts.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Prior to the earlier of the maturity date or the death of the annuitant, a Contract owner may transfer Contract account values between the Subaccounts. The Contract owner also may surrender all or withdraw a portion of the Contract account value before the earlier of the maturity date or the death of the annuitant. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> December 12, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Trial Date Set for Bush, Others: U.S. District Judge Sherman Finesilver  scheduled an Oct. 7, 1991 trial date for a $200-million civil lawsuit against  Neil Bush and other key figures in the collapse of Silverado Savings &amp;  Loan.  </P> <P> The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. filed the lawsuit against the president's  son and 12 other former Silverado directors, attorneys and executives in  September. The suit claims that the officials were "grossly negligent" in their  management of Silverado, which collapsed in 1988. The bailout of the thrift is  expected to cost taxpayers about $1 billion. The suit claims that the  defendants authorized excessive compensation to management and approved a  series of loans and other deals that drove the $2.3-billion thrift into  insolvency.  </P></p>

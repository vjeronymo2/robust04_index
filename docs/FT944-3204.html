			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / International Company News: Riva joins bidding for Ilva Laminati Piani Riva, the private Italian steel producer, has joined the bidding for Ilva Laminati Piani, the state-owned flat steels company up for privatisation, Italian news agencies reported yesterday. Riva is said to have renewed its alliance with Tarnofin, a group of entrepreneurs from Taranto and Novi Ligure, where ILP has its main plants. Neither Riva nor Tarnofin was available to comment on the report yesterday afternoon that they had submitted a bid to IRI, the state holding company which owns ILP, before Monday's deadline for offers. Riva-Tarnofin would have to beat the Franco-Italian consortium headed by Lucchini, another private Italian producer, and Usinor Sacilor of France. They submitted their own offer for ILP on Monday, in alliance with Bolmat, a private company formed by two Italian steel traders. No details of either offer have emerged. Riva was always considered one of the most likely buyers for ILP. Riva-Tarnofin submitted an offer to IRI two weeks ago, but withdrew it when IRI insisted on keeping the sale open to other potential buyers. Interviewed last week, Mr Domenico Cassalia, the president of Tarnofin and of Taranto's local employers' association, spoke of the local entrepreneurs' 'duty' to play a role in the future of the plant which dominates the southern Italian town. 'One era has finished and a new one has begun, and we have to give a signal of active involvement (in ILP),' he said. Directors of IRI are expected to meet tomorrow to discuss the offers. They do not have much time to agree the sale of ILP before the European Union deadline of December 31 for the full privatisation of Italy's state-owned steel industry. Mr Vito Gnutti, Italy's industry minister, said he hoped the EU timetable would be respected. Mr Gnutti also warned that the ambitious Italian privatisation programme was facing more difficulties than had originally been foreseen.</p>

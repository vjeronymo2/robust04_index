			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Royal Bank With its shares trading at a premium of 54 per cent to net assets, Royal Bank of Scotland has little need to worry about a bid from Lloyds or any other bank for that matter. The question is whether its performance will continue to justify a yield of only 4.2 per cent. On the plus side is Direct Line, whose first-half contribution more than trebled compared with the same period of 1992. RBS is adamant that it has no plans to float off Direct Line. Presumably, it could change its mind if flotation became necessary to support its own share price. Less clear is the message from its traditional banking business. A 32 per cent increase in operating profit before provisions is impressive and the bank expects provisions to fall in the second half. But there is also the prospect of a Pounds 35m charge from the sale of Charterhouse in the full-year figures as well as a possible hit from property revaluation. RBS managed a striking Pounds 650m increase in its mortgage portfolio, which helps employ its surplus capital. But costs have also grown sharply, while the quadrupling of spreads on mortgage lending is unlikely to be repeated. The trouble with having too much capital is that management has to work all the harder to produce a decent return. At less than 12 per cent, RBS has not reached that point yet.</p>

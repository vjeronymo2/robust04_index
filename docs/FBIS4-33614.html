			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "First Thing" program] </F>   [Text] The first well drilled by oil companies working with  Cupet [expansion unknown] in the search for new deposits has  yielded positive results. A deposit has been discovered with  research currently underway to determine its dimensions. GRANMA  reports that the discovery was made at Cardenas Bay, Matanzas  Province, in the area leased by Canadian companies Canada  Northwest Energy and Fortuna Petroleum, Inc. Tests reveal an  estimated daily production of 3,750 barrels of 16 API -- the  international unit to measure the oil's density -- oil. The oil  is considered heavy but of better quality than the oil extracted  at Varadero.</p>

			<p><P> January 9, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JOHN LAWE; HEAD OF TRANSIT WORKERS UNION  </P> <P> John Lawe, an Irish immigrant who rose from bus cleaner to become president of  the International Transport Workers Union, died at his Bronx home Thursday  after a long bout with cancer. He was 69.  </P> <P> A soft-spoken man with a lilting brogue, Lawe led transit workers in New York  City on a disastrous 11-day strike in 1980 that shut down the bus and subway  system and brought Mayor Edward I. Koch to the Brooklyn Bridge to announce to  thousands of commuters walking to work that he would refuse to give in to union  demands.  </P> <P> It was a costly walkout that saw the government impose $1 million in fines  against the union under a state law that restricts strikes in the public  sector. The union was all but broken and won few, if any, concessions.  </P> <P> The union eventually agreed to contract language that, in essence, gave up its  right to strike.  </P> <P> Born in Ireland, Lawe came to the United States in 1949 and got a job as a bus  cleaner at the now defunct Fifth Avenue Coach Co.  </P> <P> Despite his leading the 1980 strike, Lawe was considered a conservative force  in the once-militant union and was seen as part of the old guard of  Irish-American labor leaders in a union whose membership by the 1970s was  heavily black and Latino.  </P> <P> In 1985, Lawe became president of the union's international, only the fourth  TWU leader since it was founded in 1934. He will be replaced by the union's  executive vice president, George Leitz, union officials said.  </P></p>

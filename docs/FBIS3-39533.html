			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Alexis Papakhelas from Washington] </F>   [Text] The U.S. State Department leadership is putting  pressure on the White House to exchange ambassadors with the  Skopje government soon. The issue is currently being discussed  by the White House National Security Council and a decision  could be made by the end of the week.    Reliable sources say that Skopjean President Kiro Gligorov  unofficially assured the State Department that he will make a  vague statement promising to begin immediate negotiations with  his government and the parliament to cancel Skopje's flag if the  United States proceeds in establishing diplomatic relations and  Greece agrees to continue dialogue under the auspices of Cyrus  Vance.    The State Department believes that diplomatic relations  should be established by 1 March, arguing that the political  cost for Greece would be less if this happened now rather than  later. At the same time, the Americans do not want the exchange  of ambassadors to coincide with the Greek prime minister's visit  to the United States, which is scheduled for 22 April.    U.S. diplomats are also arguing that the crisis in Bosnia  and  the possibility of air raids makes it necessary to handle  immediately any pending issues in U.S.-Skopjean relations. The  United States has noted the nationalistic upsurge that has been  going on in Greece during the last few days but believes that it  will not turn into tangible, harsh measures against Skopje in  the economic relations sector.</p>

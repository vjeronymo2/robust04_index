			<p><P> November 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TANKER SPILLS UP TO 6 MILLION GALLONS OF OIL IN ATLANTIC  </P> <P> A Norwegian-flagged oil tanker spilled between 4 million and 6 million gallons  of crude oil when it hit rough seas in a storm in the Atlantic Ocean earlier  this week, the Coast Guard said Friday.  </P> <P> The tanker, named the Berge Broker, spilled Arabian light crude oil about 700  miles southeast of Nova Scotia on Tuesday, said Lt. Richard Gill of the U.S.  Coast Guard in Boston.  </P> <P> The tanker, bound for Newfoundland, apparently encountered an Atlantic storm,  but it was not known if the storm directly caused the oil spill, Gill said.  </P> <P> The captain of the Berge Broker apparently notified the Norwegian Consulate in  New York about the incident. Calls placed to the consulate and its spokesman  after business hours Friday were not immediately returned.  </P></p>

			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / Observer: Whitson's turn Midland Bank and its new Hong Kong owner are still enjoying their honeymoon, so nobody will be too upset about the abrupt departure from the Midland board of highly paid American, Gene Lockhart, and well connected Dutchman George Loudon. Evidently their faces just didn't fit any more. They had, however, proved themselves in the market place - more than can be said for Keith Whitson, Midland's new 49-year-old deputy chief executive. Having joined the Hongkong Bank from school, he has worked his passage and so has more in common with most Midland Bankers than Loudon or Lockhart. Nevertheless if Midland staff regard Whitson as just another safe pair of hands, they may be badly mistaken. In his days at Midland's new sister organisation, New York's Marine Midland, he helped reduce its assets by over a third and its staff by close to a quarter.</p>

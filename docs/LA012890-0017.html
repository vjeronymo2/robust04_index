			<p><P> January 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: *** THEY MIGHT BE GIANTS "FLOOD" ELEKTRA: ALBUMS ARE RATED ON A  SCALE OF ONE STAR (POOR) TO FIVE STARS (A CLASSIC).  </P> <P> And they might be big-time now that they're on a major label. Then again,  probably not. This third Giant effort from the New Jersey duo is quite like the  iconoclastic, independent gems that preceded it, full of socio-romantic musings  disguised as absurdist, minimalist, Dada demo-rock, not to mentionample,  accordion-accompanied power pop helpings of humorously opaque symbolism . . .  sorta like Joseph Campbell meets Weird Al Yankovic.  </P> <P> Public radio programmers, repentant intellectuals and very small children  should all love it.  </P> <P> Among the highlights (and among the four tracks produced by Clive Langer and  Alan Winstanley, with only slightly more instrumentation than usual): a revival  of the Four Lads' 1953 novelty "Istanbul (Not Constantinople)," a pointless  musing on cities' changing names that sounds like something drunkards might  sing in unison in a beer hall, if their lips could move that fast; and, more  seriously, "Your Racist Friend," an instant classic about suffering the idiocy  of fools for the sake of third parties.  </P> <P> Manic and deadpan whiny, They Might Be Giants aren't about to escape the  dreaded onus of novelty act with this brisk 19-ditty album, but geez, with  titles like "Someone Keeps Moving My Chair" (which is less easy to dissect than  it sounds) and the soon-to-be-a-college-radio-standard "Birdhouse in Your  Soul," they do still really bring it on themselves -- thank goodness.

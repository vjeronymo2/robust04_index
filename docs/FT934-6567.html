			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Allied-Lyons rises 15% despite fall in brewing Allied-Lyons, the UK drinks, food and retailing group, reported a 14.6 per cent increase in first-half profits in spite of a lower than expected contribution from brewing. Carlsberg-Tetley, the brewing joint venture formed last December, faced heavy discounting by competitors in a UK market in which volumes were still affected by recession and by cross-Channel shopping. Trading profits of Pounds 63m were up to 20 per cent below market expectations. Beer sales dipped well below the overall 3 per cent decline for the industry, partly because of a reduced number of pubs, and market share fell 0.5 per cent to 17.5 per cent. The results did not alter Allied's long-term confidence. 'We see brewing as a good long-term cash generator and we have been determined not to chase volume at all costs,' said Mr Tony Hales, chief executive. Allied's commitment to establishing Carlsberg-Tetley as a strong leading brewer was unaffected, he added. 'But that task will not be helped if the chancellor fails to deal with the impact of cross-border shopping. Latest estimates are that the current loss of duty and VAT revenue on drink is running at least at Pounds 340m, with Pounds 100m in beer alone.' Group pre-tax profits, excluding exceptionals, for the 28 weeks to September 18, rose from Pounds 267m to Pounds 306m, helped by a Pounds 10m gain from currency translation. On an FRS3 basis, taxable profits increased from Pounds 234m to Pounds 285m, after an exceptional loss of Pounds 21m on the disposal of the Chateau Latour vineyard. Trading profit was 7.2 per cent ahead at Pounds 400m on turnover up from Pounds 2.57bn to Pounds 2.73bn. The Hiram Walker spirits division raised its profits 3.4 per cent to Pounds 181m. 'Premium brand performance supports the view that spirits brands continue to have a bright future,' said Mr Hales. Leading Scotch whisky brands gained volume - Ballantine's in Germany, eastern Europe, Mexico, Venezuela and duty-free markets; Teacher's in northern and eastern Europe. Beefeater gin reaped volume and share gains in the UK and Spain; Courvoisier cognac became the brand leader in the UK licensed trade. Retailing profits increased 6 per cent to Pounds 121m. Average managed pub profits rose more than 12 per cent with food sales 10 per cent ahead. Baskin-Robbins and Dunkin Donuts planned to open another 150 franchise stores to add to the 2,098 outlets in 52 countries. Food manufacturing contributed Pounds 36m. Earnings per share grew 5 per cent to 18.9p and the interim dividend is lifted in line with earnings growth to 7.3p. Lex, Page 22</p>

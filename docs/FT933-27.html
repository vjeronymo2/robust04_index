			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of India (18): Poverty in a class of its own - Development is hampered by the world's worst illiteracy level AFTER years of neglect, India is beginning to take education seriously. But it will take many years to right the damage done to India's people, particularly the poor, by the long decades in which the ruling elites failed to make a priority of educating children. India has the doubtful distinction of having more illiterates than any other nation - almost half its population aged seven and over cannot read or write. About 20 per cent of all children never even enroll at school; 60 per cent of those who do drop out long before the end of basic education. Uneducated people have little chance of participating fully in the economic modernisation which Mr P. V. Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, and his colleagues are pursuing. Worse, the lack of literacy could itself become a serious block to further progress. With the exception of the oil-rich Gulf countries, no state has achieved industrial take-off with literacy levels below 60 per cent. The economic success of China and other east Asian nations, which all made a priority of primary education, has finally persuaded many Indians that they cannot go on as before. Mr Arjun Singh, the minister for human resource development, whose brief includes education, says that in the past education did not get the attention which it should have done because India faced other pressing problems such as building its industrial base. 'Now that other needs have been satisfied, the highest priority has been given to getting over the backlog in education.' India's target is to achieve 100 per cent literacy by the year 2000. However, this target seems unrealistic because India does not seem ready to commit to primary education the resources necessary to teach reading and writing even to all its children - never mind to illiterate adults. India spends about 3.8 per cent of its gross national product on education, about the same as other low-income developing countries, including China. However, India directs a disproportionate amount of its education budget on universities and colleges for the children of its tiny upper and middle classes. Indian education officials often argue that the reason so few children attend school is that their parents prefer to send them to work. The families need the money the children can earn. Eimi Watanabe, the former head of the Unicef office in Delhi, rejects this argument. She says parents would send their children to school if only the education on offer was better and more relevant to their needs. 'The problem in education is poor supply not poor demand.' Particularly in northern India, where illiteracy is especially high, teachers are poorly trained, have inadequate materials, and face classes of up to 80 pupils. Ms Watanabe says it is little surprise that the parents take their children out of school. Even in the poorest regions, such as the eastern state of Bihar, there are dedicated officials and teachers, some of them volunteers. But generally, in northern India, the commitment to teaching the poor is weak. Take the example of one state-level education official who explained to the representative of an international aid agency how he was able to manage his budget in spite of increasing enrollments. He said: 'Because of literacy campaigns we have high initial enrollment but fortunately we have a high drop-out rate.' The underlying reasons for India's neglect of primary education are much in dispute. Professor Myron Wiener, a US academic and author of a study of Indian education, pins the blame on the caste system. He says that the upper castes have little interest in educating the lower castes because their own position at the top of the hierarchy might eventually come under threat. Mr Wiener's Indian critics say this is nonsense. Some of them retort by blaming the British Raj for limiting high-quality education to a small elite of middle-class Indians who were trained to serve their rulers. This established a tradition of limiting access to schooling which independent India followed. Literacy levels vary widely but are generally low in the north and high in the south. In the coastal state of Kerala they come close to 100 per cent. In Bihar in the north it is less than 40 per cent. Coastal regions generally do better than in-land districts probably because they have long been exposed through trade to different influences instead of being bound by traditional caste and other ties. Also the south is more literate than the north because Christian missionaries were particularly active there at an early date teaching reading and writing as a way of spreading their faith. Hindu and Moslem teachers responded in kind - channelling competition among the religions into education. In the north, where Christianity had much less impact, competition between Hindus and Moslems was primarily military. So schooling was less well developed. But the blame cannot entirely be pushed back into previous centuries. Mr Singh, the minister, admits that for well-intentioned reasons post-independence governments put a higher priority on industrialisation than on education. Unlike other socialist-inclined countries, including the Soviet Union and China, India neglected basic schooling and basic healthcare. Also, India deliberately excluded the World Bank and most other aid donors from education arguing that foreign money was better spent on concrete projects like dams. Only in the late 1980s, did Indian officials begin to see that they were cutting themselves off from important developments in education. Only this year is the World Bank finally funding its first educational project in India - a Dollars 300m teacher training programme in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh. The picture is not altogether gloomy: as well as Kerala, which has long been seen as an exception in achieving early widespread literacy, other states are making progress, notably the relatively large southern state of Tamil Nadu, which this year pledged to build enough schools to make sure that one is within reach of every family. The state claims that 100 per cent of its six-year-olds are now enrolled. The literacy rate is 64 per cent. Unfortunately, India may still be moving too slowly towards widespread literacy. Without better education, particularly for women, it will be difficult to spread better health and hygiene standards and better knowledge of family planning. Without these, the population will carry on growing at 2 per cent a year. Eventually, millions of poor illiterates would swamp the economy, bringing growth to a grinding halt with a grave risk of widespread unrest. As Ms Watanabe says Indians are just beginning to realise the dangers. 'People are beginning to understand that education is a critical issue for population growth and economic development. They see that if they don't act they face a bleak future in the 21st century.'</p>

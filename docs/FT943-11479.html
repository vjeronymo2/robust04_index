			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Market Report London Stock Exchange: Treasury report helps calm interest rate nerves The favourable tone of the UK Treasury's monthly report calmed worries on interest rate prospects in the London stock market yesterday, and the FT-SE 100-share Index recovered more than 13 points in a determined attempt to regain the 3,100 level. The market was given a lead by strong gains in water industry stocks following an unexpectedly favourable pricing review from Ofwat, the industry regulator. A new bid from J. Sainsbury for William Low saw shares in the Scottish supermarket group immediately outstrip the terms as speculators anticipated an aggressive response offer from Tesco, the original bidder. At the day's best the FT-SE 100 was above 3,097, before closing at 3,095.9 for a gain on the session of 13.6. The September Footsie futures contract returned to a good premium, trading comfortably above 3,100 as the markets closed. Equities moved uncertainly in the early part of the session, easing at first with other European markets and then losing most of an 11.8 gain on the Footsie. But a steadier trend in the pound and sterling futures had already calmed nerves to some extent when the UK Treasury commented that all the latest data indicated steady economic growth, with no sign of input pricing pressures. Securities markets responded cautiously at first but gathered confidence in the second half of the session, helped by a brief upturn in British government bond prices. A firm start on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 12 points ahead in UK hours, reinforced analysts' perceptions that global equities still have further to run before interest rate pressures become negative. The strength of the water sector overflowed into the electricity stocks, which hoped for a similarly favourable regulatory climate to prevail in the power industry. The market had no immediate guide as to the implications of the rejection of Ofwat's ruling by South West Water. Heavy turnover in William Low shares as they topped the Sainsbury offer reflected the market view that Low's pivotal position in Scottish markets will not be taken over without a battle between the two monarchs of the industry. The final picture across the Footsie range was more mixed than the gain in the Footsie index suggested. Dollar stocks, including Glaxo, BAT Industries, RTZ and Reuters Holdings, were strong, and ICI moved forward after disclosing satisfactory first-half results, although with no change in the dividend payment. Oil shares were firmer in response to the dollar and the continued strength of crude oil prices. There was no great response from retail and consumer stocks to the easing of interest rate concerns. Banking shares continued to move confidently towards the profits reporting season, to be opened this morning by Lloyds Bank, and brushed off weakness in bank stocks in Germany in the wake of interim figures from Commerzbank and Deutsche Bank. In general, however, strategists were wary of expressing over-optimism ahead of the report today of the US second-quarter gross domestic product statistics. Market forecasts for GDP growth have been moving higher all week, and analysts now warn that growth above 4 per cent would revive all the old fears of action by the US Federal Reserve. Seaq volume increased to 657m shares, from 599.1m in the previous session; on Wednesday, retail business was worth Pounds 1.05bn, indicating that the interest rate worries dominating that session had inspired some selling pressure. But non-Footsie stocks were more active yesterday, making up nearly 58 per cent of the day's business. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index gained 9.9 at 3,642.8 as investors continued to search out growth stocks.</p>

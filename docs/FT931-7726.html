			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Letter: Chancellor should not ignore damage done by ACT Sir, Your leader, 'Budget for the supply side' (February 19), argues that the chancellor should not take action to relieve the double taxation of profits which arises from the operation of the ACT system, because the current arrangements lower the incentive for corporations to invest abroad. Fortunately, as he made clear in his 1992 Budget speech, Norman Lamont does not share your view that the current system is satisfactory. It is true that a company paying surplus ACT is encouraged to increase its taxable profit in the UK. But profit can be increased in the short term more quickly by reducing costs than by investment. So companies with surplus ACT will find tax advantages in moving administrative functions and research and development facilities outside the UK, reducing employment (and associated tax revenue) and eroding our manufacturing base. That is now happening. It is why the chancellor should not ignore the problem of 'surplus ACT' and should address it in his forthcoming Budget, before more damage is done.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Ivan Rodin report under the "Parliament" rubric with </F> general heading: "Boris Yeltsin Proposes That an Agreement on  Civil Peace and Accord in Russia Be Signed. However,  Representatives of PRES, `Yabloko,' and LDPR Were Absent at the  Kremlin Meeting With the President Yesterday"]    [Text] Boris Yeltsin's meeting with representatives of  "state, public, and business communities of Russia" (a quotation  from the statement that the participants in the meeting approved  in general) was somewhat strange, at least because people not  only from the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia], but  also the PRES [Party of Russian Unity and Accord] and "Yabloko"  did not attend it. Sergey Stankevich told your NEZAVISIMAYA  GAZETA correspondent that PRES leader Sergey Shakhray did  receive an invitation, but he was on a business trip, and other  representatives of the party were not welcome at the meeting.  Mr. Stankevich said that in principle the meeting was organized  for the purpose of reconciling the extreme ends of the political  spectrum, although it is hard to agree that the communists,  agrarians, and sectoral trade unions on one hand, and "Russia's  Choice" and the independent trade unions on the other, may be  considered as such. One may surmise, however, that someone  substituting for Mr. Shakhray as party leader was not needed  because the prime minister took part in the meeting.    Grigoriy Yavlinskiy was also passed over for an invitation,  maybe because he does not represent any of the extreme forces.  Mr. Yavlinskiy himself was calm, saying only that it seems  somewhat strange that people should be convened to reach an  accord precisely on the next day after a meeting with a former  U.S. President was canceled because the latter dared meet  opposition leaders.    The participants in the meeting adopted a statement agreeing  to the idea of drawing up and signing an agreement on civil  peace in Russia so as to create conditions for the Russian  economy to overcome the crisis and to stage a recovery in the  near future, to make policies more predictable and  understandable, and so forth. The statement, the authorship of  which is attributed to Georgiy Satarov, also has lots of other  grand, albeit somewhat sloppily constructed phrases.    Yesterday, State Duma factions considered its candidates for  the would-be working group to draw up the text of the civil  peace agreement. It has transpired that to all appearances,  none of those amnestied or their proxies will be part of the  group.</p>

			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / Treasury backs tax exemption on asset sales THE GOVERNMENT yester-day restated its determination that companies will continue to be exempt from capital gains tax on the sale of assets when they reinvest the proceeds in a related company. It held to its position in spite of a court decision on which an appeal is soon to be determined. Mr Justice Knox said in the High Court in March that the Inland Revenue's practice of granting roll-over relief to groups of companies was probably based on an incorrect understanding of current law. Defending long-standing Revenue practice, Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, backed the principle of granting roll-over relief between trading companies in the same group. 'The Revenue's practice seems to me to be sensible and to reflect how commercial transactions are commonly organised,' he said. 'We will ensure that it continues to apply.' He said he saw the need to make a statement following the judge's remarks, which had caused 'considerable commercial uncertainty'. Mr Dorrell's remarks suggest that the government may consider changing the law if the appeal judges find against the Revenue when they consider the case of Campbell Connelly &amp; Co Ltd vs Barnett. 'What needs to be done will depend on the outcome of the appeal,' Mr Dorrell said. Roll-over relief permits companies to be exempt from capital gains tax if the proceeds on the sale of an asset are reinvested in new assets. A statement of practice issued by the Revenue in 1981 said that roll-over relief would apply where one trading company in a group disposed of the asset and a different trading company made the acquisition. Mr Justice Knox's judgment suggested that this interpretation was wrong, and that the company disposing of the old asset had to be the same as the company acquiring the new asset.</p>

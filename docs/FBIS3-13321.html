			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] It was not easy for His Majesty King Husayn to  remain captive to the political equation produced by the Gulf  crisis, especially since the crisis has gotten worse and taken a  very serious turn. The crisis and its after effects have mixed  up politics and religion. Consequently, the political crisis  has enveloped Islamic shrines. King Husayn has repeatedly  cautioned and warned against mixing politics with religion.  Further, King Husayn has on more than one occasion called for  keeping holy places away from "political action". He said  sovereignty over those shrines, be they on the land of Hejaz  [Saudi Arabia] or in the Palestinian territories, should be for  God alone and not for any political side or state, whatever its  standing.    It can be said that his majesty's performance of the minor  pilgrimage on al-Qadr Night [27th of Ramadan] despite the  political crisis overshadowing Saudi-Jordanian relations, was a  practice of what his majesty has been preaching. Through his  pilgrimage, King Husayn sought to deliver a message that  sovereignty over holy shrines is for God and that the political  dispute between Riyadh and Amman does not mean his majesty will  remain deprived of his right to visit the land of Hejaz and the  tomb of his great grandfather, Prophet Muhammad.    Therefore, many observers viewed his majesty's pilgrimage  trip as a political step in religious guise. This step was  meant to separate holy shrines from politics, which always harms  the value, importance, and sanctity of holy shrines.    It can be further said that King Husayn's pilgrimage trip  last week has laid down a new principle and important tradition  in inter-Arab relations and in the link between religion and  politics. This new principle ends "the monopoly of politicians  over religious cards". It also opens the door wide to the  prospect of turning holy sites into public property, away from  the private standards set by the party holding monopoly over  these sites, especially since these private standards are  subject to change.    Observers think King Husayn's step will mark a precedent  that  can be depended upon to devise a new formula for relations among  brothers, based on a new principle stipulating that "political  differences should not prevent the parties to the dispute from  performing their religious duties. In fact, these duties could  improve ties when politics is unable to play its role."    Despite this image, which King Husayn's step created in the  minds of observers the world over, government sources have told  SHIHAN that when King Husayn decided to perform the minor  pilgrimage he had no political gains in mind. His aim was to  reestablish contact between himself and the land of Hejaz, with  which he is inseparably linked, avoiding "political complexities  and calculations."    The sources pointed out, however, that they had expected a  meeting to take place, on the sidelines of the visit, between  His Majesty King Husayn and King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz,  custodian of the two holy mosques. The sources said the  religious mission could have made political achievements had the  Saudis responded favorably.    Information available to SHIHAN suggests Riyadh still  rejects  full normalization with Jordan. The reason is not an incorrect  interpretation of Jordan's stand toward the Gulf crisis.  Rather, it is the wrong interpretation of Jordan's role in  bringing the views of the Yemeni parties closer and reconciling  them in Amman in line with the accord document. Information  also indicates that Jordan has refused over the past three years  to make a public apology to Saudi Arabia because of its  conviction that its stand toward the Gulf crisis and Iraq's  invasion of Kuwait was not biased toward Iraq, inasmuch as it  was championing an Arab solution.    Jordanian government sources told SHIHAN that Jordan did not  at all ask for U.S. intervention to mediate with Riyadh. Jordan  believes the natural framework to address the misunderstanding  resulting from the Gulf crisis is an Arab framework, be it  bilateral or trilateral. It is within this framework that an  open and frank dialogue can take place to reach genuine  reconciliation.    An official thinks Saudi Arabia agreed to normalize  relations  with the PLO in response to a U.S. desire to strengthen the  PLO's political and financial status in the wake of the Oslo  accord. Saudi Arabia also agreed to normalize relations with the  Yemeni Socialist Party -- Riyadh's archenemy before the Gulf  crisis -- to take advantage of the dispute between President  Salih and Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid and to serve Saudi  interests, which were completely neglected after the achievement  of political unity in 1990.    A Western diplomat in Amman thinks King Husayn's performance  of the minor pilgrimage, without it being crowned by an official  meeting with King Fahd -- not even a courteous meeting to show  good hospitality -- is a clear indication that normalizing  relations between the two sides is still far off and requires  major political efforts by several Arab and regional, and  perhaps international, parties. The special circumstances that  opened the Saudi gate to the Yemeni Socialist Party and the PLO  are still not available for Jordan, which the Saudi regime  regards as a regional peer on all levels.    This diplomat thinks, however, that King Husayn's pilgrimage  trip has exonerated Jordan from any obligations that could be  necessary to normalize relations with Riyadh, which is now asked  to respond positively to this overture, one way or another.</p>

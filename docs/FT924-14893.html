			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / Prison chief suspended after riot THE superintendent of the Sao Paulo prison where at least 111 inmates died in clashes with military police last Friday has been suspended, along with officers commanding the operation, writes Christina Lamb in Rio de Janeiro. Several official inquiries have been mounted into the deaths, which Mr Jose Roberto Batochio, president of the Sao Paulo Bar Association, has called a 'cold-blooded massacre by police'. Representatives from various international human rights organisations and the UN were flying into Sao Paulo yesterday to investigate the incident. A final death list has still not been published. Mr Mauricio Correa, Brazil's new justice minister, says he has information that more than 200 prisoners were killed in the police action to put down clashes between rival gangs in a maximum security block.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sergey Pepelyayev, candidate in juridical </F> sciences: "Instability of Tax Legislation Inhibits Foreign  Investors"]    [Text] The changes in the tax system and lack of  coordination between the standards of tax legislation and the  legislation on foreign investments are conditioning an arbitrary  approach in the actions of the local tax inspections. The  instructions of the Minfin [Ministry of Finance] and the  Gosnalogsluzhba [State Tax Service] still do not facilitate any  clarification of the situation.    Russian taxpayers learned the price of tax laws long ago.  Any  of their articles may be "interpreted" by the Gosnalogsluzhba or  Minfin in such a way that the initially intended meaning is  entirely lost. Some statutes may simply be ignored by the  agencies of executive power. This has happened repeatedly. For  example, this has been the case with the prohibition on making  the standard tax statutes retroactive.    However, the edict issued on 27 September 1993 by the RF  [Russian Federation] President, "On Improving Work With Foreign  Investments," was believed immediately and evaluated as the  issuance of a real legal guarantee for the effective  implementation of capital investments. The edict specified that  newly issued normative statutes regulating the conditions of  functioning of foreign and joint enterprises on the territory of  Russia shall not apply for a period of 3 years to enterprises  which existed at the moment these statutes went into effect.    Taxation is one of the significant conditions for the  functioning of enterprises, and the question of stability of the  tax legislation is a particularly acute one. With the issuance  of the edict, the problem, it would seem, has been resolved: On  most of the territory of the former USSR, the possibility of  planning activity several years in advance has once again  emerged. Foreign companies and SP [joint ventures] have  undertaken the compilation of long-term programs. However, once  again the enterprises have been betrayed by their faith in the  fact that the presidential edict is capable of withstanding the  onslaught of departmental instructions.    In December of last year, routine changes were introduced  into the tax system: The rates of a number of taxes were  increased, the procedure for filing and payment of taxes was  changed, and new payments were introduced. The foreign companies  and joint ventures were not overly worried by this event, since  they believed themselves (and many still do) protected against  any unfavorable innovations in the tax sphere. However, as  evidenced by numerous appeals by foreign companies and joint  ventures, the local tax inspections maintain that the 3-year  benefit on tax relations should not be applied, since "taxes are  not related to the conditions of functioning of the  enterprises." Since these statements bear a mass character, we  may speak of an official position of the Gosnalogsluzhba and  Minfin in regard to the edict, "On Improving Work With Foreign  Investors." However, this time they have chosen the tactics of  omission: In the letter of the Gosnalogsluzhba regarding the  procedure for applying the new tax regulations, the 3-year  benefit rule is absent.    Foreign and joint enterprises have been widely informed  about  the statutes of the edict and intend to make use of the benefits  which it grants. Therefore, many of them continue to pay taxes  at the old rates, refuse to pay the newly introduced taxes, etc.  The local tax agencies are in a state of confusion. After all,  they have not received any official written explanations in  regard to the edict. However, if the tax agencies do not follow  the statutes of the edict in the future and deem the application  of the benefit to be illegal, then financial sanctions will be  applied to the enterprises in a compulsory manner. The amounts  of these sanctions are considerable, and therefore there is not  much reason to hope that the foreign companies and joint  ventures will quietly pay the fines and that the actions of the  Russian tax agencies will not evoke a huge international  repercussion. Which, of course, will have a negative effect on  the process of investing funds into the Russian economy.</p>

			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Scottish &amp; Newcastle links with Mansfield to boost lager sales SCOTTISH &amp; Newcastle, the brewing and leisure group, yesterday announced a commercial partnership with Mansfield, the east Midland brewer. Under the agreement, Mansfield will stop brewing Marksman draught lager and instead supply its 426 pubs with S&amp;N's McEwans. In return, the Edinburgh-based group is selling 11 pubs to Mansfield for Pounds 2.2m and will stock the brewer's cask conditioned beers in some of its 1,871 outlets. Mansfield shares rose 17p to 702p on the news. Scottish &amp; Newcastle closed up 1p at 438p. Mr Jim Merrington, corporate affairs director at S&amp;N, said the deal would offer new outlets for McEwans while Mansfield, which has been seeking acquisitions outside its core Midlands region, would gain new pubs in Lincolnshire and Yorkshire. Although he declined to reveal the details of the financial agreement, Mr Merrington said: 'The Pounds 2.2m is the value of the pubs and does not represent a payment to S&amp;N' Industry analysts said the Midlands brewery is likely to have been offered an S&amp;N loan to buy the pubs and predicted the group would recoup the outlay through additional volume sales of McEwans. S&amp;N expects to sell an extra 30,000 barrels a year through Mansfield outlets at a profit of up to Pounds 20 a barrel. Mr Colin Stump, commercial and marketing director at Mansfield, said: 'We do have a finance agreement with S&amp;N to help us find the Pounds 2.2m which is on favourable terms. Our strategy is one of continual growth and we're very much on the acquisition trail.' Further big purchases would be financed through borrowing, he added. This latest acquisition follows a large expansion last year when Mansfield bought 115 pubs from Courage. Analysts, however, said the agreement was less significant for Mansfield than S&amp;N, which hopes to use an increasing number of regional outlets to boost lager sales and challenge Britain's top-selling brands.</p>

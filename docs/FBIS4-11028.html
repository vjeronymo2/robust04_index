			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Juan Manuel Diaz] </F>   [Text] Planning and Economic Policy Minister Delia Cardenas  said yesterday that obscure interests want to harm our  international banking center and the Colon Free Zone and that  some sectors of the U.S. Senate are attacking our country out of  ignorance.    The minister also said that a survey of the participants was  disclosed during the meeting [not further identified]. The  survey revealed that Panama and Nicaragua are the countries with  the worst economic growth forecasts.    The survey also showed that those surveyed pointed out that  the political stability of a country is the main factor to take  into account when investing abroad.    Cardenas underscored that during an Inter-American  Development Bank (IDB) assembly, U.S. officials attacked  Panamanian regulations for fighting money laundering and drug  trafficking. She added that this is because of the lack of  information on the country's measures against these two scourges.    The official pointed out that she defended herself from the  constant attacks that some U.S. senators made during the  meeting, because Panama's image abroad is not very clear.</p>

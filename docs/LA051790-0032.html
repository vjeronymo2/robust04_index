			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HIGH-SPEED RAILROAD  </P> <P> Your (May 4) article "High-Speed Rail Access Near Interstates Sought" describes  an apparently economical method to encourage high-speed railroad construction.  </P> <P> The federal government itself established a precedent for this during the 19th  Century by providing land grants to private-sector railroads for thousands of  miles of rights of way in order to encourage railroad construction.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, providing a right of way along a freeway will doom a 300-m.p.h.  train to operate not much faster than cars on the freeway -- less than 100  m.p.h.  </P> <P> The same laws of physics that apply to Southern California automobiles also  will apply to French, German or Japanese high-speed trains. If the high-speed  train operates much faster than freeway speed on freeway-style curves and  hills, the train ticket from Anaheim to Las Vegas will read "E-Ticket."  </P> <P> NEIL M.

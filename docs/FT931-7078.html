			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Further leak at Sellafield THE POLLUTION Inspectorate is becoming increasingly exasperated with disclosure procedures at the Sellafield nuclear site after British Nuclear Fuels yesterday reported a second leak of radiation within the past two weeks. BNF said yesterday more than seven times the usual weekly discharge of radio-active iodine was emitted from one of the site's main chimneys in the week ending February 13. The inspectorate, which was told of the incident only yesterday, has sent its second team in two weeks to Cumbria to investigate the cause. Senior officials were irritated that BNF had waited a day before notifying them of the first leak. BNF said yesterday the second reported leak, like the first, had not breached authorised limits and it had no obligation to report it, but had done so 'because of all the criticism we got over the first incident'. The second reported leak was three times greater than the one on February 10, but the beta radiation from the second reported leak is believed to be less damaging than the alpha radiation from the first. Environmentalists are concerned that iodine could enter the food chain and accumulate in thyroid glands. Dr Jack Cunningham, the shadow foreign secretary whose constituency covers the Cumbrian plant, said yesterday: 'The leak does not seem to have been of serious radiological impact, but it is yet another incident and it is unhelpful in terms of public and political confidence.' A spokeswoman for BNF said last night that as far as she was aware there had not been a similar iodine leak before.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The National Union for the Total Independence of  Angola [UNITA] and the Popular Movement for the Liberation of  Angola-Labor Party [MPLA-PT] continue to discuss peace in Lusaka  under UN mediation. Reports from the Zambian capital yesterday  said the two sides have finally agreed to review the Electoral  Law.    Independent sources have described that move as a  qualitative  step forward in the thorny Lusaka talks marathon. Meanwhile, UN  sources have said that there are not too many differences  concerning the points under discussion and that a plenary  meeting should be called soon.    The UNITA and MPLA-PT delegations have been discussing since  22 April the specific principles and modalities that will govern  the implementation of the electoral process. [passage omitted]</p>

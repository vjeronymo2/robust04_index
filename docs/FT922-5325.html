			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / International Company News: Hunter Saphir down 10% excluding claim money HUNTER SAPHIR, the fresh produce, herbs and spice group, suffered a 48 per cent drop in pre-tax profits to Pounds 2.5m last year due to the absence of insurance payments for losses arising from a fire at the company's main spice factory. Excluding the exceptional Pounds 2.1m insurance benefit in 1991, pre-tax profits for the year to February 29 fell by only Pounds 253,000. Profits were buoyed by lower interest charges of Pounds 2.2m (Pounds 4m), following a Pounds 15m preference issue in March. Turnover rose by 4 per cent to Pounds 181.5m. The dividend is cut from 5.05p to 2.5p with a 1.5p (3.7p) final. This is an attempt to bring the dividend back into line with the lower turnover since the fire in 1989, and after its virtual exit from food manufacturing. 'It would be wrong to pay a distorted high dividend,' said Mr Nicholas Saphir, chairman, 'because it will take another year to get (the UK spice factory) back to the profitability that supported a 5p dividend.' Taking into account the Pounds 1.7m in preference shares, the dividend was also uncovered. The British Pepper and Spice factory would continue to make losses in the current year, although they were expected to be lower than the Pounds 2m incurred - before insurance payments - in 1992. Orders in the new, larger factory had increased by 20 per cent since October, Mr Saphir said, although there was still about 50 per cent spare capacity. During the year, Hunter sold two businesses - Butterkist, the toffee popcorn producer, and Matthew Walker, Christmas pudding manufacturer - for Pounds 11.4m. Emile Tissot, the frozen food business, would be sold 'when we are offered the right price,' Mr Saphir said.</p>

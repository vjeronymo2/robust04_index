			<p>BFN     [Text] In an interview with INTERFAX Kazakhstan's Foreign  Minister Tuleutay Suleymenov said that each on its own, the  former Soviet republics would not be able to cope with their  problems. What they could do though, was uphold President  Nazarbayev's proposal for the creation of a Eurasian union.    According to Suleymenov, economics must in the long run  prevail over politics. In its present shape the Commonwealth of  Independent States failed to work. The 400-plus agreements  between its members were disregarded. But if two or three or  four republics interested in cooperation formed a Eurasian  union, the union would work.    Suleymenov said that although many were afraid that the  creation of supranational organizational structures would  infringe on their sovereignty, Kazakhstan had no fears of that.  And just because it was not afraid of that, President  Nazarbayev launched his call for a Eurasian union.    In the foreseeable future all Commonwealth republics would  --  one after another -- uphold the Kazakh initiative. Although  some failed to see working models for cooperation, Suleymenov  said, such models did exist and there was no need for inventing  them from the scratch. The European Union, with its concerted  customs and economic policies, and transnational banks and  payments, set an example to follow. The emergence of a  partnership on the order of the European Union would, among  other things, resolve the problem of dual citizenship. A person  who wanted to change citizenship would be welcome to do so.    According to Suleymenov, there was no wise alternative to  the  creation of a Eurasian union. The former Soviet republics would  never be able to separate. They needed each other. And even  now, they showed a higher degree of integration that the  member-nations of the European Union. So, concluded Suleimenov,  what they had to do, was join forces. They broke up only to  join forces on a new foundation.</p>

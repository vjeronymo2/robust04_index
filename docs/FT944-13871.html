			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Sanctions prove a thorny issue in US-Cuba talks Punitive sanctions slapped on Cuba by Washington in August have emerged as a point of contention in US-Cuban talks which opened in Havana on Monday. The talks, which end today, are intended to review a 45-day-old bilateral immigration accord under which the US agreed to increase the number of US entry visas granted to Cubans each year to a minimum of 20,000. This is to be done through accelerated visa processing, expanded criteria for refugee status and a visa lottery to begin November 1. Mr Dennis Hays, the US delegation leader, said restrictions on flights and dollar cash remittances to Cuba announced by President Clinton on August 20 were not part of the immigration issue. 'They will not be dealt with at this time,' he said. Cuba took the opposite tack arguing that the August package of sanctions contravened the spirit of the bilateral immigration accord signed on September 9 in New York. The US sanctions 'have as much to do with the accord and immigration as the air that we breathe,' said Mr Ricardo Alarcon, Cuba's chief negotiator. 'If you want normal, orderly immigration, you should not create obstacles to it,' said Mr Alarcon, president of Cuba's national assembly. Havana had hoped the immigration accord might lead to a wider dialogue on ways of solving the US-Cuban conflict. Mr Clinton introduced the latest sanctions against Cuba in August after Cuba's President, Mr Fidel Castro, temporarily lifted restrictions on Cubans fleeing illegally in boats and flimsy rafts to the US. Some 32,000 refugees, barred access to the US in a sudden change of policy by Washington, were sent to US bases in Guantanamo Bay in eastern Cuba and in Panama.</p>

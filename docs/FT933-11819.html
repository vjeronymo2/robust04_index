			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Bundesbank may cut interest rates GERMAN interest rates could be cut further this week even though inflation has increased again, economists in Germany argued yesterday, writes Christopher Parkes. The cost of living in western Germany rose at an annual rate of 4.3 per cent in the month to mid-July, compared with 4.2 per cent in June, the federal statistics office reported. Mr Martin Hufner, chief economist at Bayerische Vereinsbank, noted that in the previous three months prices had risen at a 'moderate' annual rate of 3.1 per cent, thanks partly to cheaper oil. Though money supply growth still exceeded the Bundesbank's target range, the rate of expansion was weakening. Mr Hufner said renewed tension in the European monetary system was an important argument for a rate cut at the central bank's meeting tomorrow, the last before the summer break. The Bundesbank announced yesterday it would accept variable bids from commercial banks for short-term funds in its weekly money market operation. Some dealers believe the cost of borrowing short-term funds should come down today by about 0.15 percentage points to 7 per cent. The Spanish peseta, Portuguese escudo and Danish krone came under some selling pressure yesterday afternoon. The French franc weakened slightly against the D-Mark.</p>

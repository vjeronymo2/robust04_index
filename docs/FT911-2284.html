			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / Parliament and Politics: King challenged on MoD estimates - Defence Questions MR Martin O'Neill, Labour's defence spokesman, yesterday challenged the government to deny reports that Ministry of Defence estimates for expenditure over the next ten years exceeded treasury forecasts by Pounds 21bn, Emma Tucker writes. He demanded to know why there had been a delay in the publication of the white paper this year and asked whether it was because 'long term costings were now indicating that over the next decade there will be an overrun of Pounds 21bn'. Mr Tom King, the defence secretary, said Mr O'Neill was 'muddled'. 'He knows that the chief secretary has already confirmed that the defence estimates for this year are likely to be Pounds 1.5bn above its originally planned level,' said Mr King. He said publication of the defence white paper had been delayed by the Gulf War and he hoped to publish it before the summer. Earlier, he said the war had cost Britain Pounds  1/2 bn. Total expenditure had been around Pounds 2.5bn but Mr King said the contributions made to those costs by other countries now exceeded Pounds 2bn. Mr King also said that 20 British officers were serving with the UN mission which would take full control of the demilitarised zone along the Iraq/Kuwait border tomorrow. Later, defence minister Mr Kenneth Carlisle said that the government was looking at the future of all naval bases. It had, in addition, not yet chosen the tank to replace the Chieftain as the army's main battle tank, but hoped to make an announcement soon.</p>

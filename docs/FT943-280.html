			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Refugees carry plague across India: New Delhi shuts schools and cinemas as cases soar to 1,800 The authorities in New Delhi yesterday closed schools and cinemas as plague claimed more victims in the city and northern, western and eastern India. The closures were the most serious precaution taken so far outside the epicentres of the disease in the western city of Surat, where pneumonic plague broke out last month, and in rural eastern Maharashtra, which was hit by bubonic plague last month. The Delhi authorities' action indicates the gravity with which Indian officials are treating the outbreak, even as they are trying to calm fears in the country and abroad. Mr Madan Lal Khurana, the city's chief minister, said the measures were a precaution and there was no need to panic. Schools are to close until October 15, and cinemas indefinitely. The number of suspected cases increased by about 400 yesterday to just under 1,800, mostly in and around Surat and in eastern Maharashtra, according to the government's National Institute of Communicable Diseases. The plague has also been spread to other places by a flood of people who fled Surat last week. Delhi yesterday reported 61 suspected cases, an increase of 30, and Bombay, the commercial capital, 69, up from 51. Officials are puzzled by the relatively low figure for Bombay, which lies close to Surat and where many of those fleeing Surat sought refuge. A handful of cases have also been reported in the tourist state of Rajasthan. In Calcutta, about 50 suspected plague victims were found to have been suffering from other diseases. The death toll remained unchanged at a revised figure of 46. Except in Surat, where the exodus of 300,000-plus people has left many streets, shops and factories deserted, life in the big cities continues as normal. Apart from sweeping antibiotics off chemist shop shelves, people have shown no signs of panic. Municipal councils have increased efforts to clean away rubbish. Meanwhile, foreign countries - notably India's neighbours - increased their precautions. Pakistan sealed all air, land and rail routes to India. The Gulf states, which had earlier banned flights, yesterday closed their ports to ships from India. Bangladesh is cancelling flights from India from today. European states and the US are screening travellers arriving from India. In the strictest travel warning issued by a western country, France has advised its nationals not to go to India unless necessary. Mitsui, the Japanese trading company, is repatriating the families of its India-based executives. Indian health officials insisted the plague was under control and accused some foreign countries, especially the Gulf states, of over-reacting. The government in Delhi called a meeting tomorrow of health officials from all state administrations to work out a comprehensive anti-plague strategy. Dr N K Shah, the World Health Organisation's representative in India, said India should be free of the epidemic in two or three weeks. Travel industry executives expressed concern that the plague was starting to affect trade, particularly package tours. However, hotels said very few business travellers were cancelling trips. India attracted 1.86m foreign tourists in the year ending March 1994, and expected 2.2m this year.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Zhang Yuqing (1728 3768 0615) of the Treaties </F> and Law Department, Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and  Trade: "New Trends in Foreign Antidumping Actions Against  China's Export Products"]    [Text] On 7 July 1993, the U.S. Department of Commerce gave  its final judgement on the antidumping case of nodular cast iron  tubes exported by China, deciding to levy a high antidumpting  tax of 127.38 percent on all such products of Chinese export  enterprises. Thus, this product of China's will be completely  squeezed out of the U.S. market.    Before 1988, on the antidumping issue the U.S. Department of  Commerce, because China was a country with a centrally planned  economy, decided to levy an antidumping tax in line with a  standard tax rate, on a Chinese enterprise that was ruled as  exporting a commodity in a manner that constituted dumping.  After 1988, changes were made in this U.S. policy: Provided that  a Chinese import or export company could prove that in a given  enterprise, in both law and fact, there did not exist government  control, the U.S. Government could, in line with the difference  in the export prices of the commodities of different companies,  separately lay down different antidumping tax rates. For  example, in the May 1991 electro-optical fireworks case and  other cases, the U.S. Department of Commerce gave rulings  according to separate tax rates. However, after Joseph Spetrini,  new acting chief of the International Trade Management Office of  the U.S. Department of Commerce, took his post, changes were  made in this policy. The signed ruling on this states: "In the  investigations and administrative reviews of the past, separate  tax rates were always applicable, but the Department of Commerce  has not yet differentiated on the basis of ownership and export  businesses; state ownerhsip is not a barrier to the obtaining of  a separate tax rate by an export company. We have now  reconsidered this policy and have decided that it is improper to  give separate tax rates to state-owned enterprises. We have  determined that an entity owned by the central government cannot  be completely divorced from the central government's control,  and that state-owned enterprises provide an opportunity for the  central government to control prices. Therefore, with regard to  future investigative cases and administrative reviews, the  Commerce Department will not consider the request of a  state-owned enterprise for a separate tax rate." This ruling was  filled with extreme discrimination against and unfairness toward  China's state-owned trade enterprises, and it also threatened  the destiny of China's export commodities on the U.S. market. In  this antidumping case, the Metal Products Company under the  China National Metals and Minerals Import and Export Corporation  engaged lawyers, provided a large amount of evidence, and made a  powerful counterplea, as a result of which the original  judgement on the antidumping tax rate was much lowered. However,  because the U.S. Department of Commerce, without exception,  would not give China's state-owned enterprises separate tax  rates, this company suffered serious adverse effects.    There were two main reasons for the antidumping tax rate on  nodular cast iron tubes being as high as 127.38 percent: 1) The  U.S. Department of Commerce had demanded that the Chinese  Government make a reply on a "standard questionnaire" issued by  the department, and the U.S. Government stated that it had not  yet received this reply from the Chinese side. 2) In China there  are a total of eight companies that export this product to the  United States, but with the exception of the China National  Metals and Minerals Import and Export Corporation, there was no  second company that agreed to act on behalf of the Metal  Products Company and make an appeal against America's  antidumping action. Therefore, the U.S. Department of Commerce,  when a ruling is made, makes use of the so-called "Best  Information Available (BIA)," which favors U.S. businessmen  (i.e., data provided by U.S. industrial appellants). The  antidumping tax rate in the U.S. final ruling was the tax level  put forward by the appellant on his first appeal.    The trend in this policy of the United States raises new  questions for the appeals made by import and export commerce  departments of China and its trading companies. At present,  China's products that have been the target of U.S. antidumping  actions are unsupported and unpermitted products, and their  export is lacking in orderly management. Their volume is sharply  increasing year by year, and enterprises are competing in  exporting them at low prices; but, when there is an antidumping  action, no one is willing to personally put up money to appeal  the action. U.S. law demands that the length of time for an  appeal be set quite strictly, and, therefore, this usually  causes the U.S. Department of Commerce to use the BIA for  China's export enterprises.    The Western countries, including the United States, have  always made antidumping a protectionist weapon to limit imports,  protect domestic industry, and promote trade. China's export  products have become the key targets of the West's antidumping  laws. Recently America and the EC carried out an antidumping  investigation of more than 20 products exported by China,  including color television sets, bicycles, computer diskettes,  cast iron tubes, carborundum, shoes, athletic shoes, fluorite,  microwave ovens, nitro-formaldehyde, (silicasolucate) [gui er  suan 8944 0059 6808], and aldose. Mexico has also made  antidumping investigations on more than 4,000 Chinese products  in 10 major categories (its export volume is 75 percent of  China's export to Mexico).    To solve the problem of foreign antidumping actions against  our export products, we suggest:    First, strengthen the coordination and management of export  products and enhance the capability and means for import and  export chambers of commerce and other societies for organiaing  appeals against antidumping actions.    Second, devise ways to penalyze exports at lower than cost,  and put a stop to the phenomena of high-price panic buying and  low-price competitive selling.    Third, set up a fund for appeals against antidumping  actions;  enterprises that are members of chambers of commerce or other  societies every year will pay a certain proportion of their  export volume value into the fund. The fund will be used for  appeals against antidumping actions as well as for investigation  and research.    Fourth, the economic relations and trade committees at all  levels must attach importance to the problem of foreign  antidumping actions against China's export products; and  supervise enterprises so that they get a good grip on the prices  and volume of export, and, after an antidumping case arises,  urge the enterprise to take the initiative in making a timely  appeal.    Fifth, the relevant government departments must make use of  all opportunities and channels, like delegation exchange visits  and mixed committee meetings, to negotiate with the governments  of Western countries to change their discriminatory practices  against China's export products.    Levying an antidumping tax on an export product is  equivalent  to squeezing it out of a foreign market. There are now more than  140 kinds of China's export products on which rulings have been  made to levy an antidumping tax. If things go on like this,  China's export potential is bound to be adversely affected, and  this should draw a high degree of our attention.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] National Assembly May 25 SAPA -- South Africa's  Parliament now belonged to everybody and the distinction between  parliamentary and non-parliamentary political groupings should  disappear forever, second Deputy President Mr F W de Klerk said  on Wednesday.    Speaking first in the debate on the president's opening of  Parliament speech, Mr de Klerk said he had no regrets about  events flowing from his February 1990 speech that unbanned the  African National Congress. "With your presence in this chamber  Parliament is at long last complete," Mr de Klerk said.  "Welcome to you -- and welcome to the millions of South  Africans, whom we all together for the first time in our  history, represent ?n this highest council of our country."    He said the National Party [NP] was prepared to play its  part  in putting South Africa first.    Mr de Klerk said the NP welcomed the theme of a  "people-centred society" which was a theme of Mr Mandela's  address. The theme had the potential to resolve a philosophical  debate.    The NP also supported the Reconstruction and Development  Programme [RDP] outlined by Mr Mandela. "The NP  enthusiastically supports most of the objectives of the RDP.  Many of the goals in the programme are also goals which have  for years been pursued by the NP. The main problem did not lie  in our willingness to meet the needs of the people, but in the  willingness of a large sector of our people to accept services  from a government which they regarded as illegitimate. This  problem has at last been removed," he said.    There was a risk, however, that the RDP would be  prescriptive  and invite government intervention.    Non-material needs like reconciliation, culture and security  were also important. There was broad consensus on these issues.  Progress was reflected by the relaxed manner in which the  elections took place, the spontaneous warmth generated by the  ceremonial activities, and the spirit of co-operation in the  government of national unity. Sentiment had to become reality.    The constitution protected the status of English and  Afrikaans and gave increased status to other languages. "It is  of the greatest importance that these measures are implemented.  And yet we find some government corporations not acting  according to the spirit and the letter of the constitution," he  said.    Minority rights were suspect during the apartheid era. "It  was associated with apartheid, racism and discrimination. In  the post- apartheid era, we South Africans will have to address  this issue fairly and squarely. The realities of our country  demand it -- the multicultural and multi-linguistic nature of  our great nation demands of us to focus on the question of  effective protection of minority rights."    Mr de Klerk quoted from the United Nations "Declaration on  the Rights of Persons Belonging to Ethnic, Religious and  Linguistic Minorities" and said the issue of minority rights  "will need to be addressed more fundamentally than is the case  in our present transitional constitution".    However, the Freedom Front's proposed "volkstaat" [Afrikaner  homeland] was not attainable and would lead to a new form of  discrimination which the NP could not support.    While the NP was committed to the concept of one-city, one-  taxpayer, there was a case for devolving control of some  government functions to the neighbourhood level. Local schools  and old age homes could be administered at the neighbourhood  level in the interests of the communities they served.</p>

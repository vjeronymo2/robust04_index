			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Letter: Print claim Sir, Your attention-grabbing headline, 'Printers win 3.7 per cent rise' (April 14), hides the true facts. Since national negotiations in this industry broke down on February 26, our member companies have been free to effect their own settlements in line with their own level of affordability. After six weeks of campaigning by the GPMU print union, only 20 printing companies have 'settled' at the level of the union's latest standard claim. There are several thousand other printing companies where no such settlement has been reached. Indeed, of those settlements recorded by the federation, more than two-thirds are below the level of the union's so-called 'minimum terms of settlement'. Colin Stanley, director general, British Printing Industries Federation, 11 Bedford Row, London WC1R 4DX</p>

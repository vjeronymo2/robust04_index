I am for the ban.  </P> <P> If we allow adults to smoke and not students, students will try to copy the  adults and start smoking themselves.  </P> <P> Smoking-related illnesses include heart disease, cancer, stroke and chronic  pulmonary disease. These illnesses kill about 390,000 people each year in the  United States.  </P> <P> So why would you want to smoke?  </P> <P> MARK BOLITA  </P> <P> San Fernando  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Radio Slavyanka" program of the Russian Defense </F> Ministry]    [Text] Pavel Grachev, Army general and Russian defense  minister, recently summed up the results of our servicemen's  peacekeeping operations.    [Begin Grachev recording] We act as peacekeepers in Moldova,  in the conflict between Moldova and the Dniester region; and we  act as peacekeepers in Transcaucasus and Tajikistan. The total  number of Russian peacekeepers is 16,000 men, more than all  other countries' peacekeepers combined. We are active  peacekeepers and we would like to settle conflicts in various  regions of the former USSR, not just by ourselves but by joining  forces with others. We are particularly interested in three hot  spots: Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Nagorno-Karabakh; Georgia,  Abkhazia and, South Ossetia, and the problem of Georgia's  integrity and its political future; and Tajikistan.

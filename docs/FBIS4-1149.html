			<p>BFN     [Text] In Togo the political crisis is back. Mr. Agboybo's  CAR [Action Committee for Renewal] and Edem Kodjo's UTD  [Togolese Union for Democracy] won the majority of votes in the  legislative elections and agreed that Mr. Agboybo should become  prime minister. Last night, General Eyadema decided to appoint  Edem Kodjo as prime minister. As a result, the largest party in  the coalition, CAR, is refusing to support this government. Mr.  Agboybo has just said this to our colleague, Adala Benraad:    [Begin recording] [Agboybo] Our concern is to do everything  in our power to safeguard the parliamentary majority resulting  from the elections. We hope that our colleague Edem Kodjo,  aware of the stakes, will reconsider his position so that we may  find a solution enabling us to maintain our majority. This is  our main concern. Therefore, in the present circumstances it is  out of the question to [words indistinct]. We want to do  everything in our power to safeguard the parliamentary majority.    [Benraad] In your opinion what would be the solution?    [Agboybo] I believe that the appointment took place in  unacceptable conditions, I do not believe that this appointment  could be considered as final. The parties concerned should meet  to reach a decision agreeable to all. [end recording]</p>

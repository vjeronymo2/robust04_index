			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Iraq arms ban loopholes 'allowed by Whitehall': Scott inquiry hears how Jordan was left off blacklist LORD JUSTICE SCOTT, the judge heading the arms-for-Iraq inquiry, yesterday questioned why Whitehall officials allowed 'glaring loopholes' in the government's restrictions on arms sales to Iraq. UK government documents made available to the inquiry show that at the end of 1991 Jordan was excluded from a British blacklist of countries which were subjected to more stringent export controls. This was in spite of the fact that British intelligence had provided what it told government departments was 'irrefutable evidence' that Jordan was diverting arms to Iraq. During intense questioning at yesterday's public hearing, Lord Justice Scott asked a witness, Mr Peter Vereker, head of the Foreign Office's arms control and disarmament department, whether he did not agree that the exclusion from the list had left open 'apparently glaring loopholes for material to get to Iraq'. Mr Vereker insisted that as far as the 'core interest' of his department was concerned, Jordan's exclusion was not important, as his department had 'other ways of catching equipment'. But, all the time referring to government documents, Lord Justice Scott implied that he was not convinced. 'What's the point of publishing a list if it hasn't got the right countries on it?' he snapped at one point. The inquiry has been looking at the export of munitions and defence-related goods to Iraq in the period up to the invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. However, in justifying his intervention yesterday, Lord Justice Scott told Mr Vereker he considered the circumstances surrounding the list of relevance since they could cast light on the strength of what he identified as a 'Jordan lobby' in the Foreign Office determined not to do anything that might upset bilateral relations. The Scott inquiry is examining the extent to which ministers, officials, or agencies may have acquiesced in allowing arms and arms-related material to reach Iraq . The inquiry heard yesterday that a list of militarily high-risk countries had been sent in November 1991 by Mr Peter Lilley, then trade minister, to Mr John Major, the prime minister, which left blank a line where 'Jordan' should have appeared. Mr Vereker said the list had been drawn up after officials from the Foreign Office's Near East and North African department, responsible for bilateral relations with Jordan had challenged intelligence assessments provided by the Ministry of Defence. Mr Vereker yesterday confirmed that an official of the Near East and North African department had handwritten over a copy of Mr Lilley's letter to the prime minister: 'Jordan's disappeared. Well done.'</p>

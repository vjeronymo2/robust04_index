			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / Chicago lawyer is brought in to head Clinton's Nafta drive PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday named Mr William Daley, a Chicago lawyer, to head the administration's lobbying for the North American Free Trade Agreement. Mr Daley - brother of Mayor Richard J. Daley of Chicago and son of the late Mayor Richard M. Daley, who ruled the city for 21 years - had long been widely expected to take the job. Nafta supporters were puzzled at the administration's apparent lethargy in getting its lobbying operation under way. Mr Clinton said Mr Daley's appointment could not be finalised earlier because he was waiting for Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, to negotiate side agreements aimed at protecting labour and the environment. The president had insisted on these before he would support the ambitious free trade treaty by the US, Mexico and Canada. The side agreements were concluded on Friday, and Nafta supporters are annoyed the administration has left the field clear for opponents of the treaty since then. Mr Daley said winning Congressional support for Nafta would be 'quite a challenge'. Being from the Midwest, his territory is home to much opposition to Nafta but he has close ties to trade unions, the treaty's most fervent critics. If the treaty is passed, it seems likely to do so with more votes from Republicans than from Mr Clinton's fellow Democrats.</p>

			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / International Company News: Dell withdraws from retail distribution Dell Computer, the US personal computer manufacturer, is withdrawing from the retail stores distribution channel in order to focus on direct sales via mail and telephone. It said retail sales 'have never been more than 10 per cent of our business' and the company had been winding down its retail distribution over recent months. Retail sales are expected to contribute less than 2 per cent of revenues in the current quarter, it added. The move reflects intense competition among the largest US PC companies for shelf space at computer 'superstores' and Dell's struggle to increase profit margins after losses in the last fiscal year. For the year ending January 31, Dell reported a net loss of Dollars 35.8m, or Dollars 1.06 per share, on sales of Dollars 2.87bn. Dell is the fifth-largest PC manufacturer, according to Dataquest, a market research company. Dell said direct sales 'offer the opportunity for more robust profit margins' and play to Dell's strengths. The Texas-based company pioneered mail and telephone sales of personal computers in the late 1980s.</p>

			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Soviet creditworthiness causes concern THE BUSH Administration is nervously eyeing declining Soviet creditworthiness before responding to a personal request from President Mikhail Gorbachev for Dollars 1.5bn in new food credit guarantees. Speaking at a press conference Monday, President Bush said he would like to be 'helpful' to the Soviets as well as to US grain producers but he was concerned about the country's ability to repay its debts. He added: 'Regrettably, the Soviet Union has not entered into the market reforms that I think Gorbachev aspires to.' In a rambling discourse on the credit issue, he seemed interested in linking the credit with Soviet economic reforms. He said he wanted to find ways 'to make the credit more secure'. Recent changes in US farm law make it necessary for the president to take creditworthiness into consideration in granting loans. According to Mr Steve McCoy, president of the North American Export Grain Association, the administration might have to design a new programme to come to Mr Gorbachev's aid. In Congress the debate over credit has gone from suggestions that the guarantees be granted directly to the Russian republic to ideas about 'securitising' the credit or linking it to economic reforms. Prime Minister Ivan Silayer of the Russian republic, on a visit to Washington last week, said he supported the Gorbachev credit initiative and downplayed the issue of who would get it. The Russian Republic would get 60 per cent of the grain purchased through the central government he said, according to an agreement with the Soviet authorities. 'We also informed the officials in the administration that next year we'll be having a possibility to conclude independently deals on importing grain from the US,' he said. 'We can be able to conclude agreements for three to five years. We would be able to do that independently next year.' On Capital Hill Senator Robert Dole, the Republican leader, has developed a revolving credit plan under which the Dollars 1.5bn would be granted in three tranches. He would seek firm assurances that the food be directed to the Soviet population, rather than the military or Communist party apparatus, and that it not be used to pressure the independence-minded republics. The first Dollars 500m of credit guarantees would be released immediately. The second and third parts would be paid only after Washington received reports of their proper use. Repayment of earlier credits could be required before the second and third tranche are released. Meanwhile the farm lobbies have begun to press for the credit guarantees. The US Feed Grains Council asked the president for an immediate allocation of Dollars 500m to meet import needs during May and June. Mr Duane Jones, the council's chairman, wrote in a letter to President Bush: 'Without these additional credit guarantees the Soviet livestock industry will collapse and US farmers will lose the Soviet Union as a feed grains and protein customer for many years it would take the industry to recover.' Mr Ron Rivinius, president of the National Association of Wheat Growers, warned the president that without the new credit, the USSR might default on its long-term grain agreement. This obliges Moscow to buy an average of 147m bushels of US wheat annually for the next five years.</p>

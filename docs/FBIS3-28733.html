Unlike former Ambassador Michael Armacost, dubbed  "Mr. Gaiatsu [Foreign Pressure]," while Mondale has done nothing  astounding, "he applies pressure through legitimate channels,  using his extensive personal connections (both in Japan and the  United States)" (according to a Foreign Ministry source). Thus,  he also proves to be a formidable foe.    Mondale, who served in the U.S. Senate for 12 years, was a  vice president, and also a Democratic presidential candidate,  took office in September 1993 as the second  politician-ambassador after former Ambassador Mike Mansfield.  Since then, he has held talks energetically with the heads and  influential members of all political parties, except the Japan  Communist Party, and executives of various economic  organizations and U.S. companies in Japan. In late January, in  a speech at a gathering organized by the Kansai Federation of  Economic Organizations, he argued for the need to reach an  agreement in the framework talks with the Japan-U.S. summit  meeting close at hand on 11 February. He said, "We need to  reach some sort of positive agreement quickly."    Many appreciate Mondale's style of doing things through  regular channels. Mondale, who has strong connections with the  core of the U.S. Administration, "is an ambassador who can call  the White House directly, and exercise influence on the U.S.  Government's policymaking" (according to a U.S. Embassy source).  Japanese Government officials also admit that "unlike  Ambassador Armacost, who relied on Mr. Ozawa (Ichiro Ozawa,  current secretary general of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]),  he does not provoke much ill will" (according to a Ministry of  International Trade and Industry source).    Officials both in Japan and the United States highly  appraise  Mondale's abilities. They believe the recently concluded  Japan-U.S. construction talks were the result of Mondale's  meeting with the embassy's economic section twice a week to come  up with ways to break the deadlock.    According to a U.S. Embassy source, with regard to the  present economic framework talks, Mondale has been "advising"  the U.S. Administration over the past three months that "instead  of the rhetorical arguments about whether or not numerical  targets will be accepted, the United States should negotiate on  the more concrete issues of what it wants and what it would like  Japan to do."    Mondale's remarks on the employment issue in relation to the  import and export of computers during the 1984 presidential  campaign made people think that he took a strongly anti-Japanese  stance. However, "(his reputation as a) champion of Japan  bashing is a thing of the past. He now behaves very moderately"  (according to diplomatic sources in Japan and the United  States). Mondale is also said to have favorable feelings toward  the Hosokawa administration, which upholds "reform" -- a cause  he himself has advocated.    Nevertheless, he is an astute politician. Some Japanese  government officials simply think that "he is merely being  careful now because he knows what came out of Mr. Armacost's  methods."    Mondale may leave for the United States temporarily on 8  February to give a direct briefing on the Japanese situation to  President Clinton. As the framework talks, which may have  serious effects on Japan-U.S. relations, enter a critical stage,  it is also an opportune time to see how this powerful ambassador  will exercise his leadership.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Two Hong Kong journalists have been harassed by  Chinese security police for allegedly violating China's law on  state secrets.    A book marked for "internal circulation" was found in their  luggage when security police searched their hotel room in  Wenzhou in Zhejiang province on April 4.    The police claimed the journalists had violated China's Law  on the Protection of State Secrets, saying that as "non-mainland  people" they should not possess books bearing the mark "internal  circulation".    The two women journalists from the Hong Kong  Chinese-language  daily The Express--who wish to remain anonymous in the wake of  the Xi Yang case--recently went to Wenzhou to report on  voluntary medical work by a team of Hong Kong doctors, nurses  and therapists.    The 12-person medical team were providing a free service to  500 rural patients.    On April 4, the two journalists--a reporter and a  photographer--visited the city's bookstores and made several  purchases, for which they were given receipts.    When the security police searched their hotel room they  found  medical documents provided by local medical officials at Wenzhou  city hospital.    Though the journalists proved they bought their books in a  local bookstore and the documents were given to them by a local  hospital for publicity purposes, they were still warned by the  police.    The books and other printed matter were confiscated.    Chiu Sin-tsang, the chief editor of The Express, yesterday  said he could not yet comment.    Daisy Li, chairwoman of the Hong Kong Journalists'  Association, said the Express incident posed a new threat to  normal journalistic activities.    "We are very concerned (about) this incident, which may  cause  tremendous anxiety among (the) local press," she said.    "China can have a very arbitrary definition of so-called  classified materials, which in this case are books and publicity  materials," Li said.    She said China should make clear which materials  "non-mainland people" should not hold.    This latest incident indicates China has not only hardened  its stance when dealing with the press in the capital, but has  extended its hardline policy to other provinces.</p>

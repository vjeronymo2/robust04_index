Denying reports that Japan had rejected U.S. requests for  the  meeting, Fujii said, "We have not received such a request yet."  But he said he considered the proposed meeting "positively" and  he told a press conference he wanted to "take the opportunity"  to meet Bentsen, indicating that Japan may propose the meeting.    Fujii declined to comment on what they might discuss, but  said he is "not in the position to negotiate" for the Japan-U.S.  "framework" trade talks in reference to recent U.S. demand to  meet with officials who can make political decisions instead of  bureaucrats.    Turning to domestic issues, Fujii indicated that the  government's new economic stimulus package will be launched by  month-end, but hinted that an income tax cut may not be  included. The compilation of the package is progressing  "substantially," and the completion will not be "so far away,"  he said.    Considering the tax issue, he said, "it's separate" from the  package that is now being formed by the Economic Planning Agency  because the decision is left to a joint economic problem forum  of the government and the coalition parties. But Fujii noted  that he wishes tax cuts to be included as an economic measure,  saying "that's more favorable."    Given the package, his ministry will compile a third fiscal  1993 supplementary budget along with fiscal 1994 budget, he said.</p>

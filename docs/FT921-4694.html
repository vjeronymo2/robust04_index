			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Tories pledge to launch national lottery by 1994 A NATIONAL lottery to raise up to Pounds 1bn for Britain's arts, heritage, sports and charities will be introduced by 1994 if the Conservatives retain power at the general election. The UK is the only country in western Europe without a national lottery and opinion polls suggest that more than 70 per cent of Britons would approve of one. A white paper published yesterday set out the form the lottery is likely to take, including the allocation of cash by an independent National Lotteries Board, management of the lottery by private sector contractors and prizes of up to Pounds 1.5m. Authorities in the UK have not always been hostile to lotteries: the British Museum was founded in 1753 with funds raised by public lottery. Recently there has been growing pressure for a national lottery as a way of raising money for sport and the arts, but it has faced strong opposition from Treasury ministers who feared a big loss of revenue from taxes on football pools and other forms of gambling. These doubts have now been overwhelmed by a powerful combination of ministers who see the promise of a lottery with big prizes as an election vote-winner. The proposal will feature in the Tory election manifesto, and legislation introduced in the first session of the new parliament if the Tories remain in government. Mr Kenneth Baker, home secretary, told the Commons that the lottery, with 50p or Pounds 1 tickets, should raise a gross Pounds 3bn or more each year. About 35 per cent of the total would go to 'good causes', 15 per cent would be used for administration and promotion, and the rest for prizes and tax. The level of tax and the means of collecting it would be up to the chancellor. Mr Roy Hattersley, shadow home secretary, condemned the government's failure to have talks with pools promoters before making an announcement 'primarily intended to cobble together a few votes'. But he added that a Labour government would give 'serious consideration' to a lottery. Mr Baker brushed aside the claims of Labour MPs that the football pools would be unable to co-exist with a national lottery offering such big prizes. One possibility he raised was that the big pools companies could form a consortium to bid for the franchise to run the national lottery. The Pools Promoters' Association, which represents Littlewoods, Vernons and Zetters, welcomed the government's acknowledgement of their special circumstances and said they were ready to play a constructive part in talks about the lottery. The three companies employ 6,500 people, mostly in the Liverpool area, and fear big redundancies. Both the arts and sports councils welcomed the white paper, while the Charities Aid Foundation said it backed the lottery but was concerned at some aspects of the proposals.</p>

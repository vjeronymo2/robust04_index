The resolution called on all countries  concerned to join the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and to  place their nuclear weapons under the supervision of the  International Atomic Energy Agency.    What makes this important step for consolidating world peace  in this sensitive part of the world more significant is that the  approval of Egypt's proposal to free the Middle East of nuclear  weapons was coupled with another resolution, which Egypt voted  for, on Israel's nuclear weapons. The resolution called  directly on Israel to renounce the possession of nuclear weapons  and join the nonproliferation treaty.    Egypt's call, which was backed by the UN General Assembly,  was not born accidentally or imposed by certain circumstances.  It stemmed from the Egyptian leadership's firm belief that  world peace is indivisible and that it is high time to end the  state of armed struggle in the Middle East so that the people  may give more attention to economic and social development to  create a better tomorrow for future generations. [passage  omitted]    The UN General Assembly's resolution calling for freeing the  Middle East of nuclear weapons is a practical way to help  promote the ongoing peace efforts exerted by the international  community. It will prevent those countries that possess nuclear  weapons from threatening their neighbors and imposing their will  on them. It will also prevent other countries from attempting  to obtain these destructive weapons in a bid to ward off the  nuclear threat against them. In addition, it will help put the  brakes on all types of arms races by the region's countries and  eliminate all potential hazards that may result from radiation  in the densely populated Middle East region. More importantly,  the resolution paves the way for the disputing parties to regain  confidence in each other, which would ultimately help them meet  half way to achieve a just peace that guarantees the legitimate  rights of all the region's countries.    Egypt's call to free the Middle East of nuclear weapons is a  new addition to the extensive efforts that President Mubarak has  been exerting for years to promote peace between the Arabs and  Israel at the international level. At the same time, it affirms  Egypt's deep belief in the strategy of peace as the only way for  reaching an understanding among the region's countries and  highlights the need for all countries in the region not to  violate it, regardless of the excuses they use as a facade.  Through the United Nations, Egypt has opened the door for all  regional countries to prove their goodwill and seriousness in  their quest for peace and to get rid of nuclear weapons. When  will the regional countries that possess nuclear weapons respond  to the world community's peaceful call?</p>

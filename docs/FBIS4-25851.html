			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Debbie Kuo] </F>   [Text] Taipei, June 15 (CNA) -- After laborious efforts  and negotiations, Taiwan flower growers finally have persuaded  Japan to run quarantine checks on Taiwan fresh-cut flowers  intended for the Japanese market here rather than in Japan.    Japanese customs authorities agreed Wednesday [15 June] to  apply the new quarantine procedure starting at the end of this  year, according to a Council of Agriculture (COA) official.    Currently, all Taiwan fresh-cut flowers are quarantined by  Japanese customs after arrival there. A majority of the  flowers, however, are fumigated with methyl bromide after  failing the stringent Japanese quarantine standards. Most  flowers exported to Japan are chrysanthemums, but also include  gladioluses and roses.    The fumigation seriously downgrades the appearance and life  span of the fresh flowers, thus reducing the profits of the  Taiwan flower growers and exporters, said Chen Chiu-nan, a  division chief of the COA's food and agriculture department.    Once the Japanese officials start conducting quarantine  checks in Taiwan, fewer fresh flowers will have to be fumigated  and losses will be minimized, Chen asserted.    According to customs tallies, Taiwan exports an average of  5,200 metric tons of fresh-cut flowers worth U.S.$11.27 million  a year, of which 5,000 metric tons go to Japan.</p>

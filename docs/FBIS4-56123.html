			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, May 25 (BTA) -- National Assembly Chairman  Aleksandur Yordanov called on Prime Minister Lyuben Berov to  resign. Only the prime minister's resignation would pave the way  for early elections on the basis of the Constitution and the  law, Yordanov said in a statement broadcast on national radio  and television tonight.    In two days only the prime minister had two proofs that he  does not enjoy parliament's political confidence, Aleksandur  Yordanov said. He referred to the sitting last Thursday [19  May] when the cabinet narrowly survived a no-confidence vote,  supported by a mere 25 MP's, as well as to last Friday [20 May]  when the MP's voted down Berov's proposals for structural and  personnel changes to the cabinet.    What is needed for early elections is not agreements but an  early end to the government's term; any other option is part of  the pre- Constitution stage and is of no legal import, Yordanov  said. He recalled that under the Bulgarian Constitution only  after the prime minister's resignation can the president show  constitutional initiative and assign the parliamentary groups to  form a government; should they fail to do so, the president  appoints a caretaker cabinet. Yordanov described any other  initiative as an "infringement on the authority of others"  which, in his view, destabilizes political life and the country  as a whole.    On Friday President Zhelyu Zhelev appealed to the political  forces to reach agreement, including the passage of a few key  acts of parliament, a date for the elections, and the  appointment of a caretaker cabinet by the president later on.  Prime Minister Berov proposed more or less the same to the  parliamentary forces two days later. "In the name of  parliamentarism and democracy, I appeal to the prime minister  and the president to refrain from such initiatives," Yordanov  said.</p>

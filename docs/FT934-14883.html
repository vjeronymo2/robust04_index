			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Attwoods moves back to basics - Analysts welcome disposal of US recycling business ATTWOODS' sale of its lossmaking Mindis recycling business in the US was widely welcomed yesterday as the necessary, if painful, removal of a nasty thorn. Mindis has proved, with hindsight, an extremely costly foray into recycling  -a business driven more by politicians than economics and, consequently, one that has struggled to take off. It was also a business exposed to wild swings - recently downwards - in base metal prices. However, the announcement of the Dollars 40m (Pounds 26m) sale and the Pounds 91m provision to cover the resulting loss was accompanied by a set of results for the year to end-July from which it was difficult to isolate the performance of the ongoing business. The headline figures were a preliminary pre-tax loss of Pounds 62.2m compared with a profit of Pounds 25.1m, on sales up 20 per cent at Pounds 410m, and losses per share of 25.25p (earnings 6.84p). Looking forward, Attwoods focused on pro-forma profits on continuing business, excluding Mindis, where the pre-tax figure rose from Pounds 27.2m to Pounds 33.1m. On this basis earnings per share rose from 7.98p to 8.96p. However, the picture is more complicated. Attwoods profits included a Pounds 5.4m exceptional profit from a well timed D-Mark currency hedge which will continue to generate cash on a monthly basis while the D-Mark remains at current levels. There was also a receipt of Pounds 2.9m from an insurance claim. The interest line was also affected by changes in the accounting rules that reclassify preference shares as debt for presentation purposes, even though Attwoods' banks consider them to be equity instruments. Interest on these shares now appears above the line. But the main change to interest is a Pounds 2.4m increase as a result of translation of interest on foreign denominated debt. There is also a Pounds 2.01m provision covering a US litigation, which under the FRS 3 standard now appears above the line as an exceptional item. Regarding the Pounds 91m provision, only Pounds 61.2m hits the balance sheet. The balance of Pounds 30m is goodwill on acquisition of Mindis which must be written back to the profit and loss account on disposal. Mr Ken Foreman, chairman, welcomed the opportunity for Attwoods to get back to its mainstream business of managing waste contracts. 'Mindis has taken a lot of our time,' he said. 'The sale will allow us to focus on the growth areas and getting better returns from the existing business.' However, the market may need some time to digest Attwoods' figures and the implications of the replacement of Mr Donald Jackson at the head of Laidlaw, the Canadian company that controls 38 per cent of Attwoods. Analysts yesterday welcomed the removal of the unpredictable Mindis business and a return to the comparative certainty of long term waste collection contracts. A strong start to the year in the UK and the US is only partly offset by the poor performance in Germany, where nevertheless, Mr Foreman says the group is still making higher margins than in the UK. Analysts said that Attwoods could therefore make pre-tax profits of about Pounds 36.3m this year, including profits from the foreign exchange hedge, giving earnings of 9.2p. Finding new contracts outside the US, the UK and Europe is not, however, going to happen overnight so growth from new markets may be some time off.</p>

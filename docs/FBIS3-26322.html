			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Fan Liqing (5400 7787 7230) and Fang Jin (2455 </F> 3866)]    [Text] Beijing, 4 Feb (XINHUA) -- The meeting on issues of  routine affairs between Tang Shubei, executive vice president of  the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits [ARATS],  and Zou Zhekai, vice president and secretary general of ARATS,  on the one hand; and Jiao Renhe [Chiao Jen-ho], vice chairman  and secretary general of the SEF [Straits Exchange Foundation],  on the other, which began on 1 February, ended today after  reaching a consensus. Both sides will hold the fourth round of  talks in late March this year in order to reach a consensus on  the text of the agreement on the three issues of routine affairs.    Following conclusion of the talks, Tang Shubei said that  after four days of earnest discussions and common efforts, both  sides had reached understandings on the following issues:    1. Both sides feel that they have reached a wide range of  understanding on three issues of routine affairs, including the  "repatriation of hijackers," the "repatriation of personnel who  enter the other side's territory in violation of relevant  regulations and other related questions," and the "handling of  maritime disputes in the Taiwan Straits." Both sides agreed  that this has laid a good foundation for the holding of the  fourth round of talks and the signing of a written agreement.  Both sides have agreed to hold a meeting at the vice secretary  general level in Beijing in late March in order to reach a  consensus on the draft agreement on the three issues. Jiao  Renhe hoped that Tang Shubei and his ARATS counterparts will  proceed to sign a formal agreement in Taipei on the basis of the  draft agreement.    2. Both sides have also agreed that during the fourth  working meeting to be held in late March between the two  organizations, both sides will hold formal discussions on other  topics included in the "Joint Agreement on the Wang-Gu [Ku]  Talks." The topics of discussions will include the protection  of intellectual property rights; joint operations against  maritime smuggling, robbery, and other criminal activities in  the Taiwan Straits; and economic, scientific, and technological  exchanges and cooperation.    3. Entrusted by ARATS President Wang Daohan, Tang Shubei  handed Wang's letter to Jiao Renhe on 1 February, inviting SEF  Chairman Gu Zhenfu [Ku Chen-fu] to visit the mainland this year.  Jiao Renhe said he would actively create conditions for the  second meeting between Wang and Gu. The time and venue of the  Wang-Gu meeting will be discussed at the March meeting.    4. The two sides also agreed to assist each other in the  handling of the inherited property of some of the personnel who  left the mainland for Taiwan [before 1949].    On the basis of reaching the above understandings, both  sides  will publish a news release tomorrow.    Tang Shubei said after holding discussions, both sides have  enhanced mutual understanding and promoted the formation of  consensus. This fact shows once again that high-level  face-to-face meetings are very important because it is conducive  to increasing mutual trust and reaching mutual understanding.  The current visit to Beijing by Jiao Renhe for discussions in  this meeting was absolutely necessary. He said it is in this  scene that President Wang Daohan has invited Chairman Gu Zhenfu  to visit the mainland.    After the conclusion of the talks, Jiao Renhe also said: The  method and attitude adopted by both sides for discussing issues  were conducive to their solution. After long hours of  discussions, both sides have reached an understanding. They  will proceed quickly to make arrangements for the next round of  consultations on issues of routine affairs.</p>

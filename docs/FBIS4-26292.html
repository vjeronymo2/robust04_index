			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 20 (XINHUA) -- South Korea Monday [20  June] proposed to meet with the Democratic People's Republic of  Korea (DPRK) on June 28 to discuss procedures for the  inter-Korean summit meeting.    The proposal, contained in a message from South Korean Prime  Minister Yi Yong-dok [name, title as received] to his DPRK  counterpart Kang Song-san, said that a three-member delegation  from each side headed by a deputy prime minister will meet at  the truce village of Panmunjom.    South Korean President Kim Yong-sam accepted a proposal by  DPRK President Kim Il-song to hold an inter-Korean summit  through former president of the United States Jimmy Carter here  last Saturday.    "I was authorized to let you know that we agree to the  proposal as it is the most ideal event considering the inward  and outward conditions of our country and the fervent wish of  our people," Yi Yong-dok said in the message.    He noted that the burden on both South Korea and the DPRK  has  been getting heavier over the past half-century because of  distrust and confrontation.    "We have been saying that a meeting of the top leaders is  favorable if it would quickly dissolve the south-north tension  aroused by the nuclear problem and settle a relationship of  reconciliation and cooperation by opening the door to peaceful  reunification of our country," Yi said.    Carter had visited South Korea and the DPRK from June 13 to  18 as "a private capacity" and exchanged views with Kim Yong-sam  and Kim Il-song respectively on the situation on the Korean  peninsula, including the nuclear issues.    Kim Yong-sam, upon hearing of Kim Il-song's wish to meet him  at any time, anywhere without pre-conditions at an early date,  told Carter on June 18 that he will accept the offer "without  any hesitation."</p>

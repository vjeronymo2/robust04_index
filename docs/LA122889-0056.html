			<p><P> December 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: MALIBU;  </P> <P> SAVINGS IN DRAINAGE PROJECT  </P> <P> With the county expected next month to select a contractor for the remainder of  a $13.8-million drainage project on Big Rock Mesa, some residents have  expressed hope that the project's cost may still be trimmed.  </P> <P> Mike Caggiano, a spokesman for the Big Rock Improvement Committee, said this  week that the group has persuaded about 60 Big Rock residents to grant the  county rights-of-way on their properties for the work, in what could save the  county up to $400,000 in legal fees.  </P> <P> "We've got maybe two-thirds of the property owners committed, and we intend to  keep trying for the rest," Caggiano said.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors last month approved a plan to tax  Big Rock Mesa homeowners up to $100,000 each for a drainage system to stabilize  the landslide-plagued community.  </P> <P> The supervisors are expected to award the contract for the remainder of the  project next month, with work to begin in March.  </P></p>

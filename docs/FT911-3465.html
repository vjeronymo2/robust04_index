			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil prices rise to nearly Dollars 20 then fall back sharply OIL PRICES fell sharply yesterday after rising almost Dollars 1 a barrel over the last two days in line with strong prices for gas oil in Europe and gasoline in the US. The price for North Sea Brent crude to be delivered in June slipped 0.2 cents to Dollars 19.425 a barrel yesterday after touching almost Dollars 20 a barrel at mid-session. North Sea prices were depressed late yesterday by a weaker New York market where the June futures contract slipped to Dollars 20.90 a barrel. 'There's been a lot of technical buying over the last few weeks and as we go down those people will be exiting the market, which will push it even lower,' said Mr Andy Lebow at ED &amp; F. Man. Gas oil prices have been boosted by the unseasonally cold weather in Europe which has given a temporary fillip to demand, particularly from Germany. At the same time, US petrol stocks have been run down to minimum operating levels, giving rise to fears of shortages as the nation enters its peak driving season in the next few weeks. Imports of petrol to the US have been low as higher prices have sucked deliveries into Europe. But cargoes are now arriving in the north-eastern US again and are starting to relieve any tightness in the market with the attendant depressing effect on prices. North Sea Brent traders rushed to buy oil on Monday when Chevron announced it would pull one of its cargoes from the May delivery programme in the North Sea. The company will start maintenance work on the Ninian pipeline next month. But Mr Peter Gignoux at Lehman Brothers said, 'there is plenty of foreign crude around and I think traders are beginning to realise this.' Iranian tankers that were anchored off the Bay of Cadiz near Spain are understood to have set sale, prompting traders to speculate that Iran is beginning to sell its oil in floating storage.</p>

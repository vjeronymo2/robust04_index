			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report over video showing soldiers patrolling downtown La </F> Paz, includes video statements of Bolivian Labor Federation, COB  leaders Vladimir Terceros and Oscar Salas identified by screen  captions -- recorded]    [Text] [Unidentified reporter] Several COB leaders have  lamented the administration's decision to order police and  military forces to take action against the demonstrators  throughout the country to prevent road blocks and street  marches. Vladimir Terceros, one of the leaders, stated that the  workers have the right to stage demonstrations in order to get  the government to pay more attention to their demands.    [Terceros] As we see it, the workers are taking steps to  compel the administration to heed their requests. Meanwhile the  peasants are also on the move and will stage their own  demonstrations because we believe that in a state of law we are  entitled to express our opinions and positions, especially since  we are enjoying a democracy which is an achievement of Bolivian  workers and people, not of the individuals who now claim credit  for it without having done anything to bring it about.    [Reporter] COB Executive Secretary Oscar Salas asked the  government not to pit police and military forces against the  workers and to prevent bloodshed.    [Salas] The Army must not be pitted at the people, nor  should  it be allowed to become an instrument of repression of the  people. We are asking the Army not to do this.    [Reporter] The union leaders are perfectly aware of all the  problems that the demonstrations can cause, but they also know  that the workers need a sizable salary hike.</p>

			<p><P> March 2, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> NORTH ISLAND EMPLOYEE BEING QUESTIONED IN PROSTITUTES' SLAYINGS  </P> <P> A young public works employee at North Island Naval Air Station was arrested  Thursday on suspicion of assaulting a prostitute, and authorities are  questioning the man in the slayings of dozens of other prostitutes in San Diego  County.  </P> <P> Sgt. Jim Cooke of the county Sheriff's Department said after the morning arrest  at the base that "we're not saying yet" that James Morris Jackson, 23, is a  suspect in the string of 40 slayings of young street women, most of them  prostitutes and drug addicts.  </P> <P> "But naturally, because of the nature of the crime, we're going to look at him  and see if there's any possible connection," Cooke said. "He may have been  involved in the other cases, but we don't know yet."  </P> <P> The special Metropolitan Homicide Task Force investigating the slaying first  became interested in Jackson when it was reviewing routine San Diego police  cases involving prostitutes, Cooke said.  </P> <P> It learned of a case in which a female prostitute was abducted in San Diego  early Monday morning and assaulted. Investigators identified Jackson as a  suspect, then began trailing him, Cooke said.  </P> <P> On Thursday morning, they arrested him after he drove over the San  Diego-Coronado Bay Bridge about 6 a.m. on his way to work at the air station,  where he is a civilian employee. Cooke said Jackson did not resist arrest, and  he was taken to police headquarters for questioning.  </P> <P> Police declined to release a photograph of Jackson; Cooke said detectives plan  to have him appear in a lineup.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Jackson was taken to County Jail and booked on suspicion of assault  with force likely to cause great bodily injury, false imprisonment and forcible  oral copulation in the Monday assault.  </P> <P> The arrest is the seventh made by the task force since it was formed in 1988.  Five of the cases have resulted in convictions. Cooke said the remaining case  goes to trial later this month. In that case, Alan Michael Stevens is charged  with murder in a November, 1988, slaying near Pala-Temecula Road in North  County.  </P> <P> The task force, composed of city police and sheriff's deputies, was created  after intense publicity about the series of prostitute slayings. Most of the  women were abducted in the city and their bodies found in remote parts of the  county.  </P> <P> The killings began in 1985, just after a similar set of slayings ended in the  so-called Green River series of prostitute murders in the Seattle area. Those  slayings also remain unsolved.  </P></p>

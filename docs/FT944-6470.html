			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / World Commodities Prices: Nervous selling hits prices at London Metal Exchange - Market report A bout of nervous selling and liquidation hit all London Metal Exchange contracts yesterday afternoon and only COPPER found support before the end of the session. Three months delivery TIN lost more than Dollars 200 a tonne, while ALUMINIUM was down Dollars 65 and ZINC Dollars 40. 'They lost some of their upward momentum last week and this was enough to get some investors to lighten their load. . . it just snow-balled,' a trader explained. Aluminium was hit in a thin lunchtime inter-office market by US selling, which took the three months price below Dollars 1,880 a tonne, triggering stop-loss selling down to Dollars 1,827. At the London Commodity Exchange, COCOA futures ran out of steam to close sharply lower as trade selling in New York triggered mixed selling and stop-losses in London, dealers said.

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Moscow Ostankino Television First  Channel Network in Russian at 1800 GMT on 30 December broadcasts  an item in the "Novosti" newscast in which Aleksandr Ukhov  reports from Moscow that the Russian Army will be getting a new  emblem next year. The Moscow Ostankino channel presents what it  calls "the first pictures" of the new emblem.    Ukhov says that the Russian Defense Ministry recently  organized a competition for a new emblem for the Russian Army.  Almost 300 proposals were submitted for consideration. The  results of the competition have recently been announced. The  new emblem will consist of a crowned double-headed eagle holding  a laurel wreath and sword. On an inset shield mounted on the  eagle's chest a horseman can be seen killing a dragon. The  eagle clutches the Russian national flag and the St. Andrew's  flag in its claws.    A brief interview with V.N.Medvedev, head of the insignia  department of the Ministry of Defense General Staff  Headquarters, is then shown. He says: "There are plans for  placing this unified emblem of the Russian Armed Forces on  military uniforms, banners of military units, military and navy  flags, identification marks on military equipment, documents and  identity cards."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Ivan Novikov] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 27 TASS -- The Russian State Duma Snubbed  President Boris Yeltsin on Friday by deciding to create its own  TV and radio service.    On Thursday Presidential Spokesman Vyacheslav Kostikov urged  the lower chamber on behalf of the Russian President to refrain  from such a decision, but the request was ignored.    The TV and radio service will employ 49 people and is to  daily report on activities of legislative authorities.  Representatives of various factions will have 30 minutes of  daily air time.    The Duma thus followed suit of the former Russian  legislature, the Supreme Soviet, which was dissolved by the  President last September. It had also created its own TV  service which appeared on central TV with the "parliamentary  hour" programme. The broadcasts were intended to provide  objective coverage of the work of the legislature which said  that state-controlled media was biased about it.</p>

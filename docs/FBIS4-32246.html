			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] The 23-24 April unification congress of  the Liberal Democratic Congress (KLD) and the Democratic Union  (UD) resulted in the formation of the Freedom Union (Unia  Wolnosci or UW). The name, suggested by former Deputy Prime  Minister Leszek Balcerowicz and evoking an element of  romanticism," a common aspect in Polish culture, was approved by  a vote of KLD and UD members present at the unification  congress. While the unification resolution itself was supported  by an overwhelming majority of the delegates, 130 amendments to  the newly adopted party statute were proposed at the congress.  <H5>  Leadership </H5>   Former UD leader Tadeusz Mazowiecki was elected chairman of  the new party according to a precongress arrangement by party  leaders. Despite the fact that the KLD's Donald Tusk received 10  votes more than Mazowiecki in the balloting for chairman, Tusk  was named to the post of UW deputy chairman, instead. The  congress also elected 100 representatives to the party's  National Council (Rada Krajowa), with 73 from UD and 27 from the  KLD, among them former Privatization Minister Janusz  Lewandowski, former Labor Minister Michal Boni, former Prime  Ministers Jan Krzysztof Bielecki and Hanna Suchocka, and  prominent Sejm Deputies Jacek Merkel and Jacek Taylor. The UW's  11-person presidium includes, in addition to Mazowiecki and  Tusk, Wladyslaw Frasyniuk, Hanna Suchocka, Jan Maria Rokita,  Bronislaw Komorowski, Bronislaw Geremek, Jan Litynski, Janusz  Lewandowski, Pawel Piskorski, and Waldemar Kuczynski--a mix of  left, right, and center, "just the way Tadeusz Mazowiecki  wanted," according to Dominika Wielowieyska, writing in the 26  April GAZETA WYBORCZA. Former Internal Affairs Minister  Komorowski, described in a 4 May RZECZPOSPOLITA interview as a  "Christian Democrat ideologue" by fellow UW member Wladyslaw  Frasyniuk, was elected UW general secretary. As reported in the  25 April GAZETA WYBORCZA, Mazowiecki and Tusk promised that the  new party would have "a clear, distinctive face."  <H5>  UW Profile </H5>   In the above-mentioned 25 April article, GAZETA WYBORCZA  described the new party as center-oriented, "with a slight tilt  to the right." Deputy Chairman Tusk emphasized that the party  should "steer a center course" and build "a strong, consistent  opposition" to the ruling coalition. He noted that "all we have  to do is say that we are the opposition that embraces all those  who are for freedom and against those seeking to strip us of  this freedom, that we are against collective farming and we are  for privatization, against socialist Poland and for the Third  Republic." Mazowiecki reiterated that only the UW can be an  alternative to the ruling coalition "that came to power only by  criticizing the governments of the past five years, while the  moral right to govern belongs to those who fought for the  freedom." The Freedom Union's unification declaration, as  reported in the 26 April GAZETA WYBORCZA, strongly criticized  the past six months of governing by the leftist coalition,  calling it "a lost time for Poland," underscoring the  government's "halt of privatization" and "increase of the debt,"  while it was "simultaneously centralizing power, creating new  privileges and alignments, and promoting political criteria in  administration.    In the economic sphere, the congress assured the  continuation  of the economic reforms begun by the Mazowiecki government in  1990. According to the 26 April GAZETA WYBORCZA article, the UW  is "against raising taxes and limiting competition," supports  reprivatization, and maintains that the state should not  differentiate economic conditions "based on political pressures  and tactical interests." In the 4 May RZECZPOSPOLITA interview,  Komorowski said that "there is not much difference" between the  UW's program and that of the precongress UD and KLD individual  programs because "it originated as a result of many discussions  between the two parties." Komorowski added that the "main  elements" of the program are "strong support for a free market  and democratic reform."  <H5>  "Social Liberal" Faction </H5>   In a move that clearly revealed the continuing ideological  differences within the party, Jacek Kuron, former labor minister  in Hanna Suchocka's government and an advocate of social  programs for the underprivileged, declined to participate in the  elections for the new party leadership, stressing that no party  should be composed solely "of friends of the market" (UD) and  "friends of the entrepeneurs" (KLD), "with no friends of the  people." Kuron said that the new party may still be capable of  creating an "ethos of civilization that might yet win the  support of other groups and of a broader electorate." He  expressed doubts, however, that the liberals (from the KLD) will  be able to think in broader terms of "the state." In  particular, Kuron opposes curbing the powers of trade unions,  saying "demands for decent pay are worth listening to." (GAZETA  WYBORCZA 25,26 April)  <H5>  Post-Congress Commentaries </H5>   Commentaries representing various points of view in major  publications assessed the chances of the new party. A commentary  in the 30 April POLITYKA by Mariusz Janicki highlighted the  congress's usage of "strong anticommunist rhetoric" emphasis on  unity, and confidence that "every educated, unprejudiced and non  pro-PRL [pre-1989 People's Republic of Poland] person will vote  for it." The Freedom Union has, in Janicki's opinion, a chance  to be an alternative to the ruling coalition, especialy now  when, in Mazowiecki's words, "the governing coalition cannot  hide its absurdities, ineptness, and rash decisions."    Boguslaw Mazur, writing in the 8 May issue of the Poznan  weekly WPROST, a magazine that entertains leftist views,  observes that "the Christian-democratic/liberal group has the  dominant role in the UW leadership," whereas that faction  represented by Frasyniuk and Zofia Kuratowska, more  social-democratic in tone, is in the minority. Mazur predicted  that the latter faction may yet leave the Union, allowing the  center-right group of Jan Maria Rokita, former chief of the  Council of Ministers in the Suchocka government, to become the  major force.    In the 6 May RZECZPOSPOLITA, Jan Szomburg, president of the  Gdansk-based Institute of Research on the Market Economy and a  KLD activist, cites some of UD and the KLD's past weaknesses,  asking why UD, "the strongest intellectual party in the  postcommunist world, was unable to communicate the sense of  reform to the average voter. Szomburg noted that recent polls  show that only 30-40 percent of the people consider themselves  advocates of the free market. He questions the UD's "lack of  communication, arrogant language, and absence of a clear  message" and asks why there was such an expectation on the  party's part that society would put its complete trust "in the  hands of an elite." Szomburg is also critical of the KLD,  calling it "a party that payed more attention to style than to  substance, too inclined to political pragmatism that somehow  watered down the party's identity." Szomburg added that a  proreform program with a clear strategic vision leading to the  completion of the economic and political reforms is necessary in  order for the Freedom Union to be succesful. Such a vision,  according to Szomburg, requires a dose of romanticism," to which  Freedom Union "is no stranger."    While the UD garnered just under 11 percent of the vote in  the September 1993 parliamentary elections, the KLD's 4-percent  support left the party under the 5-percent threshold required  for parliamentary participation. As reported by WPROST magazine  in its 8 May edition, recent polls show that Freedom Union  enjoys the support of 22 percent of the electorate, mostly among  people between the ages of 20 and 39.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Quito, 4 Feb (AFP) -- Ecuador began this Friday with  complete calm following a nationwide workers strike yesterday to  reject a recent 71.2-percent increase in gasoline prices. This  morning sanitation workers were removing debris left from the  barricades erected by demonstrators in the streets.    Activities were returning to normal as urban buses began  providing service. On Thursday the buses paralyzed a large part  of the country when they stopped operating to avoid being  damaged by demonstrators.    There were no major incidents as rightist Ecuadoran  President  Sixto Duran-Ballen confronted the third workers strike in the  first 18 months of his administration, which will conclude in  August 1996. On Saturday Duran-Ballen implemented a price  increase from 1,460 to 2,500 sucres (from $0.71 to $1.22) a  gallon (3.785 liters) for the most widely used gasoline in the  country. This measure was rejected by political, social,  student, and labor sectors. More than 12 demonstrators and 20  policemen were injured during the clashes, which also caused  heavy damage to public and bank buildings in Quito and the port  of Guayaquil.    The United Workers Front (FUT), which includes the most  powerful labor federations, ordered the 24-hour strike to demand  wage increases and the cancellation of the fuel price hike. It  announced it is planning another nationwide strike in the next  few days for an indefinite period, as well as an empty-pot march  by housewives and an Indian uprising [levantamiento de  indigenas], scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday respectively.</p>

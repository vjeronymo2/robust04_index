			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Strong first day for 3i Venture capital group 3i was a sprightly performer on its first day of trading following the flotation of 45 per cent of the equity. Heavy institutional demand ensured that the stock closed well above its issue price on turnover of 27.5m shares. The group is capitalised at Pounds 1.7bn and consequently expected to be an early candidate for entry into the FT-SE 100 Index. As such, it would be a vital component of investment institutions' portfolios. The bookbuilding process saw Pounds 1.2bn of demand for the Pounds 530m of stock issued to institutions at 272p a share. The remaining Pounds 180m of stock went to retail investors, and the shares, which began trading at 283p, ended the day at 292 1/2 p. Although the flotation was set at a 13.5 per cent discount to net asset value, there was a certain amount of relief at the level of demand. Analysts said the asset value was calculated at 314p a share at the end of March but had probably fallen since then, thus reducing the discount. Mr Hamish Buchan of NatWest Securities said: 'This is a very good result. Maybe the market is beginning to see 3i as a small companies' specialist, rather than a venture capital specialist.'</p>

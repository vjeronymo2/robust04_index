			<p><P> June 19, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IT DOESN'T TAKE A GENIUS: U.S. MUST WIN BIG TONIGHT;  </P> <P> GROUP A: IN ORDER TO ADVANCE TO THE SECOND ROUND, AMERICANS NEED TO DEFEAT  AUSTRIA BY AT LEAST THREE GOALS.  </P> <P> Asked Monday about his soccer team's chances to advance to the World Cup's  second round, U.S. Coach Bob Gansler acted as though it gave him a headache to  think about it. His subject when he taught at the University of Wisconsin  Milwaukee was history, not math.  </P> <P> "The mathematical possibilities would require Einstein at his best," Gansler  said.  </P> <P> Without Einstein at their disposal, U.S. players turned to one of their own,  defender Paul Krumpe of Redondo Beach, an aerospace engineering major at UCLA  who quit his job at McDonnell Douglas to play for the national team.  </P> <P> Using a computer at the training camp here, Krumpe discovered a scenario  involving six combinations of events and 18 teams that would enable the United  States to become one of the 16 teams in the second round.  </P> <P> "It's still within the realm of possibility, but it would be extremely  difficult," Gansler said.  </P> <P> So Gansler has spent the four days since a 1-0 loss to Italy in Rome preparing  his team for the only variable it can control, a three-goal or better victory  over Austria tonight in Florence.  </P> <P> Also winless after two games in the four-team Group A, the Austrians have an  equally long wish list. It starts with a two-goal or better victory over the  United States.  </P> <P> Soccer experts would say that Austria has a better chance of achieving its  desired result than does the United States.  </P> <P> But soccer experts also said before the tournament that the Americans would  score no goals in their three first-round games. It took them about an hour to  prove the experts wrong on a goal by midfielder Paul Caligiuri in a 5-1 opening  loss to Czechoslovakia.  </P> <P> That might not be much, but it is one more goal than has been scored by the  Austrians.  </P> <P> With forwards Gerhard Rodax and Toni Polster, the second- and third-leading  scorers in European professional leagues this season, Austria entered the World  Cup with one of the most respected offenses.  </P> <P> But in 1-0 losses to Italy and Czechoslovakia, the midfielders had difficulty  getting the ball to the forwards. That has resulted in frustration and  dissension that might lead tonight to humiliation.  </P> <P> According to Monday's Presse, a Vienna newspaper, the Austrians "are even  starting to fear the much-mocked Americans."  </P> <P> With speculation rampant in Austria that he will be fired if his team loses to  the United States, Coach Josef Hickersberger has announced two midfield changes  and added a third forward, Andreas Ogris.  </P> <P> Expecting an all-out assault from the Austrians at the beginning of the game,  the U.S. players said they will employ the same nine-men-back defensive tactics  that they used so effectively against Italy, but with more assertive  counterattacks.  </P> <P> "Austria came to the World Cup with high expectations," U.S. defender Desmond  Armstrong said.  </P> <P> "If we hold together defensively, we can frustrate them and then get a  counterattack going. If we score against them first, they might fold."  </P> <P> Armstrong, who did not allow Italian striker Gianluca Vialli a shot Thursday  night, draws Rodax, the No. 1 scorer in the Austrian League, for this game.  Defender John Doyle of Fremont, Calif., has responsibility for the larger, less  mobile Polster, the No. 2 scorer in the Spanish League.  </P> <P> "That makes you wonder about the Spanish League," Armstrong said. "Polster only  plays with his left foot."  </P> <P> Naturally, Doyle is more concerned about Polster.  </P> <P> "He's a proven scorer," Doyle said. "Maradona hasn't scored any goals here, but  you know he's a scorer. Polster will break out of this. I just hope he doesn't  do it against me."  </P> <P> Gansler said the difference in his team from the first game to the second was  its level of intensity. Based on practices this week, he said he believes the  players will maintain the intensity they displayed against Italy.  </P> <P> But he felt it necessary to call a team meeting Sunday night because he was  concerned the players might be distracted by questions about their future.  </P> <P> Six players -- midfielders Tab Ramos of Hillside, N.J., John Harkes of Kearny,  N.J., and Caligiuri of Santa Monica, forwards Peter Vermes of Delran, N.J., and  Chris Sullivan of Redwood City, Calif. and Doyle -- are in the preliminary  stages of negotiating to play professionally in Europe.  </P> <P> The U.S. Soccer Federation is negotiating a deal for Ramos with Roda, a  first-division team in the Netherlands. The player with the best prospects,  however, might be Caligiuri, who has had contacts with two teams, Parma and  Cagliari, in the Italian League.  </P> <P> "We've done a lot of talking about what guys are going to do after the World  Cup," said Vermes, who played for Volendam in the Dutch first division last  season and is talking with teams in Switzerland, Belgium and the Netherlands.  </P> <P> "But it's important that we do well as a team. We were all trying to do too  much individually against Czechoslovakia. Maybe we had professional contracts  on our minds.  </P> <P> "Against Italy, we realized that we'll look good as individuals only if the  team plays well. It's important that we keep that in mind against Austria."  </P></p>

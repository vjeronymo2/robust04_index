On Saturday in his interview with Interfax he expressed  opinion that people "who are in Matrosskaya Tishina and  Lefortovo will start an active political struggle against the  president, government, and existing regime immediately after  their liberation."    Lysenko qualified the resolution on amnesty, which, as he  said, was initiated by the leader of the Party of Russian Unity  and Concord Sergey Shakhray, as "a destabilizing factor." At  the same time he pointed out that if "an extremist wave is not  very high after the liberation of the October events  participants then Shakhray will bypass his major political  rivals of democratic orientation, Yegor Gaydar and Grigory  Yavlinskiy." "If the situation sharpens then the consequences  will be very serious both for Shakhray and for the Party of  Russian Unity and Concord headed by him. In this case the  president will dismiss the initiator of this document," he said.    Lysenko did not rule out possibility of "preliminary  contacts" between the State Duma speaker Ivan Rybkin and Boris  Yeltsin on the issue on amnesty. At the same time he declared  that "Shakhray was the first in this issue." "I am almost sure  that first of all Shakhray has coordinated this issue with  Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin," said Lysenko.</p>

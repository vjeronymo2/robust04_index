			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Motoring: Four wheels good, two wheels bad - The merits of getting a grip on winter driving THERE IS nothing like the first snowflakes of winter to turn a motorist's thoughts to four-wheel drive. Tyres lose grip. Wheels spin uselessly. Cars pirouette or slide slowly into kerbs. Family cars with fairly narrow tyres fare better than high performance models with ultra low profile tyres. Their treads, meant to resist the severe abrasion and heat build-up of very fast driving, can be next to useless in snow. The really high performers also benefit year-round from all-wheel drive. It has a wonderfully calming effect when driving them on roads that are merely wet and winding, not covered with ice and snow. Strangely, many buyers who really need all-wheel drive only when their local roads are snowy for a week or two every winter go for the knobbly tyred, on-off road kind of 4x4s. These are a compromise. To go well across country they must be high slung, have suspensions with a lot of vertical travel and transmissions with two sets of gears - one for the road, one for the rough stuff. If you think none of these features is of much use for driving on normal roads, whether snow-covered or not, you would be right. If you are going to drive on rutted farm tracks, massive ground clearance is essential. But if not, most buyers would be better served all year round by one of a number of otherwise normal cars with part-time or full-time four-wheel drive. There are a lot of them about, with prices starting from around Pounds 7,000 for a small Subaru Vivio or Justy hatchback. They go from front-wheel to four-wheel drive at the touch of a button on the gear lever knob. One of the latest to reach Britain is the BMW 525iX Touring - 'X' because it has an advanced and fully automatic four-wheel drive system. Routinely, the power is split 36 per cent to the front wheels, 64 per cent to the rears. But sensors monitor road speed and individual tyre grip. They can tell if the driver is accelerating or braking, instantly varying the power distribution to favour the tyres, front or back, left or right, with most grip. Full ABS braking is retained. The Pounds 27,350 525iX with manual transmission has the muscle and refinement one expects of a BMW. Tyre grip was so good that brutal acceleration on wet and muddy roads caused no wheelspin. As a bonus, it clung to slippery bends as though stuck to the surface. It would have been nice to have tried it on snow but I have not seen any in the south east of England for two winters and I pray this one makes it three. But four-wheel drive BMWs have been sold on mainland Europe for several years. When I was driving a Renault Espace Quadra over some exceedingly slippery alpine passes some time ago, the only car to overtake me was a Swiss-registered BMW. I was puzzled why a car with only rear-wheel drive was leaving me for dead. Then I glimpsed the 325iX badge on the boot lid as it stormed by in a cloud of snow. The BMW 525iX Touring estate car with manual gearbox gave me 24.5 mpg (11.53 l/100km) during a week of motorway and minor road driving. A 5-speed automatic transmission is a Pounds 1,150 extra. * * * Driving the new Pounds 39,995 Range Rover LSE to Paris for the motor show earlier this month confirmed impressions received when I sampled it briefly in Wiltshire (this column, October 3/4). It was splendid on the autoroute, though a slight rumbling vibration at around 80 mph (129 kmh) dictated an equally quiet cruising rate of either 75 mph (121 kmh) or 85 mph (137 kmh). In the anarchy that prevails around Arc de Triomphe and on the dreaded boulevard peripherique, its bulk, solidity and commanding outlook were great assets. The seats were comfortable, there was ample power to out-accelerate speeding small fry and I have no doubt it would have kept its end up on an autobahn. Due to its high gearing (only 2,750 rpm at 80 mph/129 kmh) the fuel consumption was 16.3 mpg (17.3 l/100 km). That was much closer to Land Rover's claim of a 17 mpg (16.6 l/100km) average than I had expected. This time the pneumatic suspension made no heavy breathing noises; the level-maintaining air compressor ran silently. The ride on smooth motorways was beyond reproach and it brushed aside the stretches of cobblestones still found in Paris. But I did not like its wriggly restlessness on the country roads between my home and Dover docks. I was surprised the cover had to be taken out before I could stow two golf bags in their trolleys in the load space. It is not as big as it looks. But the lengthened wheelbase provides rear seat legroom like a London cab's. Land Rover says a lot of people buy a Range Rover instead of a BMW 7-Series, Mercedes S-Class, Jaguar or Toyota Lexus. I am sure they do, but let us be clear about one thing. A Range Rover is an alternative to a luxury executive car, not a direct substitute. Whatever its virtues - and it has many - it simply does not drive like one. For me, unless you intend to make use of its off-road cap ability or at least pull a two-horse trailer, it loses much of its point.</p>

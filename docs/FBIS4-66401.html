			<p>CSO     [Text]    "Messaging systems" have recently been in the spotlight. A  messaging system is an easy-to-use voice mail system that  permits a customer to leave a recorded message for a responsible  person when he cannot come to the phone. Thus the job of  receiving and responding to phone calls is eliminated. Moreover,  the system can be used as a fast and sure communication network  for workers within a company utilizing the functions of batch  announcement or voice mail. With the rising mood of productivity  improvement, the system will be employed widely by on-site as  well as off-site employees enabling them to interface with  customers from inside and outside the company and its service  department.    A "messaging system" typically has a recording function  which allows a customer to leave a recorded message for a  responsible person when he is absent from the office, and basic  voice mail functions. The product that can be as simple as a  voice mail system is getting quite a bit of attention among  companies aiming at increased productivity. The system can be  interfaced with a combination of push button telephones or a PBX.    If the system's recording function is utilized, then the  overwhelming job of answering the phones will be nearly  eliminated. Also it is possible to use the system as a  communication network for employees including off-site workers  by using batch announcement and voice mail functions. Recorded  messages can be retrieved with human voice quality, close to  that of the speaker, from any place including outside the  company, at any time as long as a telephone is accessible.    The product will be employed largely by those companies busy  with answering calls from customers. The companies and  departments involved with on-site and off-site work such as  customer service will also likely use the system quite heavily.  <H5>  Reduction Of One Hour Overtime </H5>   Active users who make full use of the messaging system are  getting improved results.    For example, a trading company, Kyune and Nargel Japan  (headquartered in Tokyo, Japan) with a total employment of 50  people including on-site and off-site workers, uses the system  and they have "reduced overtime for each worker by at least one  hour a day." The initial investment including telephone  equipment was &yen;5 million, but the cost was recuperated in  about two months. After two months, the system reduced the  costs. "The business can no longer be managed without the  messaging system."    Air-conditioning installation company, Angei Industry  (headquartered in Tokyo), also evaluates the result by saying,  "productivity for on-site office workers has improved. The  efficiency for off-site workers is also improved greatly by  communicating using voice mail. Wasteful phone calls are reduced  and the amount of our telephone bill is lowered too."  <H5>  Market Participation By Each Maker Intensifying Product </H5> Variety    Since Matsushita Communication Industry introduced the  "Simple Messaging System 2 WAY" in April, 1991, which aimed at  market penetration for messaging systems, gradually each maker  has been entering the market. In 1993, each maker has come up  with a variety of products ranging from push button telephones  to PBX interfaces (see table 1 for product list).       Table 1.

Matsushita Communication Industry has already  delivered almost 6,000 units of the 2 WAY Series to customers.  Other makers are also saying, "for new push button telephone  sales, the market will grow at a rate of 20-30 percent and  installations will also increase" (Manager of Nittsu Industry).  "Within the year, over 1,000 systems will be sold," said the  Manager of Oki Electronics Industry. That is the overall  situation. Although there aren't makers other than Matsushita  that have sold over 1,000 systems, it is projected the day will  soon come when the combined sales of all makers reaches over  10,000 systems.  <H5>  Voice Is Digitized, Stored, And Processed </H5>   Looking at its configuration, the messaging system has a  built-in push button telephone in the main unit or connected to  a digital interface integrating a single system. That is because  incoming calls are set initially to connect to the telephone via  the messaging system when the telephone call is received by the  recorder.    The voice to be recorded is digitized (bit rate 16k -  64k/second, differs for each maker), stored, and processed.  Because of the digital sound processing, it became easy to send  the voice data to a specified address or to copy it, allowing a  voice mail function or batch announcement to be easily provided  to users. A messaging system has a built-in hard disk and memory  device, and the system is operated by establishing the same kind  of individual mailbox that is seen in the traditional model.    A call can be selected for either automatic recording,  meaning that when the telephone is connected, it will record  automatically, or for manual recording by which a caller can  choose to record by pressing a specified button. After  recording, if the address is specified by pressing a button,  then voice will be recorded into the specified mail box. Input  and output of voice mail from off-site is possible by entering a  user's ID or personal identification number or by calling a  separate telephone number to which the messaging system is  connected.  <H5>  Easy To Use Functions Have Been Added to the System </H5>   Also, even when voice mail (including recording) is  received, if a message indicating arrival of mail is not  displayed, the user may miss the message. For this reason,  messaging systems have various message announcement functions.  It is standard that for on-site use, a lamp will be turned on to  indicate the arrival of a message. The lamp will be turned off  once the message is retrieved. It is possible to verify the  status of mail sent to an off-site worker, that is, you can  determine whether or not the message has been received.    For the purpose of mail status verification, a wall  indicator on which the status of mail can be displayed is  available as an option (see table 1). To announce the arrival of  mail to off-site workers, a function connecting the system to a  paging system or mobile phone can be added as an option.    Messaging systems also include several other functions to  make them more user friendly. For example, when recording  messages, people sometimes speak for a long time. For this  reason, when the message is sent, an additional recording  function may add a comment to the content of the message (when  message is retrieved, comment is heard initially) or there may  be a skip function allowing the user to skip messages in order  to speed up playback. There is also a function to transfer the  call to some other extension number after retrieving the mail,  so that the caller can talk to a responsible party in the  company.    With the addition of these various functions which enhance  the system's recording ability, they can be more effectively  utilized in a corporate environment.  <H5>  Improvement of On-Site Work By Recorded Communication </H5>   A real effect of recorded communication can be found in the  good example of leaving mail for on-site workers who receive a  call for the absent responsible party at a company.  Traditionally, if an on-site office worker receives a call from  a customer, the following will take place: (1) memo will be  taken while call is received; (2) after the telephone  conversation, summary of telephone conversation is written and  message will be written; (3) the message will be delivered to  the responsible person; (4) a call is received from a  responsible person; (5) or go to the responsible person; (6)  deliver the content of the message. If an emergency call occurs,  then the person who receives the call must wait patiently for a  responsible person. Meanwhile, the work of an on-site office  worker is interrupted because he is waiting for a call from the  responsible person.    On the other hand, by using a messaging system, the on-site  office worker can record the message from the customer  (automatic or manual), and the voice mail can be transferred to  a responsible person by pressing a button. In the case of an  emergency, it is possible to immediately announce the arrival of  mail to an appropriate person by use of a paging system. After  paging, the off-site worker can listen to the message by  accessing the mail. Thus frequent calls that an off-site worker  must place in order to get a message at the office are  eliminated, and responsibility for the on-site office worker who  is sometimes obliged to deliver an emergency message to an  absent off-site worker is reduced. As a result the on-site  office worker can devote more time to his own work.  <H5>  Support the Telephone Interface For Operator Substitution </H5>   To support the telephone interface, various telephone  operator substitution functions are provided. For example, as a  standard function the messaging system can act as an answering  machine serving individual extensions or each user. Also, there  are quite a few products which are equipped with "substitution  call during busy line," or "substitution for non-responsive  call" in which the system substitutes for its operator function  to obtain the caller's message while the line is busy or after  several rings when an incoming call does not produce a response.    The answering machine function is especially effective for a  company which has business operations overseas involving time  differences. The "individual answering machine function alone is  quite helpful, and the use of a messaging system has become  quite important" (manager of Newsweek International).    Also another application of the answering machine function  is to receive orders during off-business hours. With NEC's  messaging system the caller can select a menu item by pressing a  button to provide voice information in order to retrieve  appropriate information based on the purpose of the call. For  example, travel agencies can use the telephone system as a  telephone-based guide system.  <H5>  Progression To Voice Mail And Batch Announcement </H5>   Although messaging systems have several enhanced functions,  "many companies decide to use it because of its recording  function" (Nittsu Industry). That is the real reason to decide  to use the system. As usage increases, "batch announcement  applications will increase too" (Matsushita Communication  Industry). Utilization will also change as demand increases. In  reality, batch announcement or voice mail are utilized, but "the  ratio of these applications is about 10 percent for the  announcing function, and information exchange among colleagues  at the site and voice mail is about 40 percent," said one of the  users at Angei Industry).    Applications for communication networking using voice mail  and batch announcing have been surfacing.  <H5>  Messaging Systems Do Not Do Everything </H5>   However, in order to smoothly operate a messaging system, it  is necessary for a decision maker to play a wise game to enforce  the system and to get user cooperation. For example, Kyune and  Nargel cited above, decided to eliminate all memo messages when  they decided to employ a messaging system. When a female office  worker received a phone call, memo pads were not accessible on  the desk so that voice mail use was enforced. Thus, if an  off-site employee calls, nobody will find any memos to read.  Such an environment forced the off-site workers to use the  messaging system.    In order to fully utilize the system, "the decision maker  must be prepared psychologically to become an expert for this  system" (Angei Industry). At Angei Industry, if off-site workers  would like to communicate with each other, and if a caller  forgets the other party's mailbox number, the individual mailbox  number is announced at the beginning of the call, so that the  call will be enabled. Unless a real user's situation is  witnessed, real problems will not be fully understood, and even  if the messaging system is understood, if utilization of the  functions is not fully grasped, it will be difficult to act on  the situation. In reality, "if the purpose of utilization is not  fully understood by the employees, full use may not be expected"  (unspecified company). Naive thinking may not bring effective  results.    Also if the recording function is utilized in the messaging  system, privacy considerations must be included. If a caller can  easily leave a message it may raise issues of personal privacy.  Each maker typically adds some note indicating, "please first  include brief introductory warning to a caller, and then start  recording." In real situations the recorded message, "your voice  message will be left . . .," which requires an optional response  from a caller, may be sufficient. In order to protect privacy  some makers are studying inclusion of an optional "periodic beep  during the call which signals the caller that their voice is  being recorded."  <H5>  Future Topic On the System Connections Between Distant Areas </H5>   As utilization of the system increases, problems increase  too. For example, if each department at the company employs a  messaging system, then the necessity of connecting between the  main office and branch offices to cover a wider area will arise.  Present messaging systems do not have an ability for such  integration connecting all local systems. For this reason, voice  mail can not be transmitted between each local system.    If a communication network which includes all the branch  offices and the main office is desired, then it will be  necessary to consider the voice mail service provided by VAN  companies such as Marubeni Telecom or Recruit. However, their  service does not include the recording function. Because of this  the decision maker must consider whether the recording function  or the voice mail function is more important.</p>

			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / World Trade News: EC victory in steel tube dumping fight EC producers of seamless steel tubes have won an 18-month campaign against allegedly unfair trading after the European Commission found four east European countries guilty of dumping tube in the Pounds 500m Community market. The Commission's verdict has been greeted with relief by the west European industry. Imports of seamless tubes, used widely in the engineering sector, had rapidly reached an intolerable level across the EC, but especially in Germany and Italy, the Commission said. The decision is important for seamless tube producers such as Mannesmann of Germany and Dalmine, part of Italy's Ilva group, Vallourec of France and British Steel. Over the past two years, the Commission said, 11 EC tube mills had closed, with 18,000 jobs lost in the past six years. Mr Raymond Barbier, secretary-general of the EC steel industry's liaison committee, said yesterday the east Europeans' share of the EC market had jumped from 7.8 per cent in 1988 to 13.4 per cent last year, reaching 18 per cent this year. The liaison committee lodged an anti-dumping complaint in May last year, and the Commission opened an investigation in December. It now says the case is fully justified, serious injury has been caused to the EC industry and dumping prices have been used. 'To try to resist the proven dumping of these four countries, Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia and Croatia, EC producers had to reduce sales prices on several occasions, without succeeding in reducing the flow of these imports,' the Commission said in its judgment. 'All the Community producers are in difficulties, and further plant closures and job losses are feared.' From November 15, all seamless tube imports to the EC will incur 21.7 per cent duty for Hungary, 10.8 (Poland), 30.4 (Czechoslovakia) and 17.4 (Croatia). The Croatian duty will be temporarily suspended because the civil war has severely disrupted exports. Seamless tubes are not covered by the 1951 European Coal and Steel Community treaty under which main European steel producers are seeking urgent action from the EC against allegedly subsidised east European imports. But the problems of the tube producers and the general steel industry are 'absolutely similar,' Mr Barbier said.</p>

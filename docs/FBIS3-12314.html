			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A responsible source at the Interior Ministry has  said that in the wake of the criminal massacre that took place  at dawn today at the Ibrahimi Mosque, some marches were staged  in Amman to protest the heinous crime committed by Israeli  settlers against pious worshipers in Hebron.    In a statement to the Jordanian News Agency, the source said  Khalid Husni al-Qurashi attacked (Lon Edwards), a British  tourist, at the Hashimite Square at noon today and stabbed him  with a knife. The tourist was immediately rescued. He is now in  a good condition. The assailant was arrested.    The Interior Ministry expresses its understanding of the  overwhelming feelings that accompanied the grave event that took  place at the Ibrahimi Mosque today. It, however, urges citizens  to exercise self-restraint and close ranks so the feelings of  support for our people in the occupied homeland will not turn  into irresponsible, instantaneous reactions that harm our  feelings and our just cause.</p>

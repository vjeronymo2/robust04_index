			<p>BFN     [Text] Cape Town May 23 SAPA -- Suggestions that the  KwaZulu land deal was intended to lure the Inkatha Freedom Party  into the April elections were "rubbish" and "nonsense", home  affairs minister Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi asserted on Monday.  "It was the legislation passed in Parliament that brought me  into the election," Chief Buthelezi said.    Answering reporters' questions on his way to joining his  cabinet colleagues for their first meeting at Tuynhuys, Mr  Buthelezi said the Ingonyama [kings'] Trust Act had been debated  in open session in the KwaZulu Legislative Assembly. In terms of  the legislation, the 1.2 million hectares of KwaZulu tribal land  -- that would have become state property under the new  constitution -- was ceded to Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini. The  legislation had been approved by former President FW de Klerk  "in the way that he signs all legislation".    Mr de Klerk approved the Ingonyama Trust Act on April 25,  four days after it was passed by the KwaZulu government. "All  communal land was always protected. It was to prevent it  becoming state land," he said.    The land was transferred to the KwaZulu government three  years ago. "I don't find anything controversial in it," he  said. Chief Buthelezi said the issue would not be discussed at  the cabinet meeting.</p>

			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / FT Guide To The Week Keating visits Indochina Paul Keating, the Australian prime minister, begins an eight-day visit to Indochina, incorporating stops in Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam. It will be the first time an Australian prime minister has visited post-war Vietnam. Mr Keating's visit follows strenuous efforts to shore up Australia's position in Vietnam, now that the US trade embargo against the country has been lifted. Australia currently ranks fifth among countries awarded investment licences in Vietnam, but is expected to face formidable competition for contracts in infrastructure and telecommunications from US corporations. Nato general in Romania General George Joulwan, Nato Supreme Allied Commander, Europe, begins a two-day visit to Romania where he will meet President Ion Iliescu and other senior officials. General Joulwan will discuss ways of improving military co-operation between Romania and Nato within the framework of the Partnership for Peace, which Romania signed in January. Last month President Bill Clinton lifted the US embargo on high technology arms sales to Romania. Talbott begins trip Strobe Talbott, US deputy secretary of state, begins a nine-day trip to India, Pakistan, Poland, Slovakia, and Nato in Brussels. Greece tackles tax evaders Greece's socialist government will consider a tax bill, aimed at cracking down on Greece's legion of tax evaders, at a special cabinet meeting. The bill will try to redress the injustice of easily taxed wage earners paying the largest share of Greece's tax burden. Premium Bond millionaire Ernie, the National Savings computer, picks the first Pounds 1m monthly Premium Bond jackpot prize. The UK's Premium Bonds, which have no capital growth but offer holders the chance of winning cash, used to have a Pounds 250,000 jackpot. Japanese trade surplus The Japanese current account surplus in February is expected to widen to Dollars 12.2bn, from Dollars 6.8bn in January. The strong yen is still boosting the dollar value of Japanese exports, and keeping the surplus high. However, this short-term effect may be followed by a downturn in exports and a reduced surplus as the yen makes Japanese goods uncompetitive. Budget tax rises bite The start of the new UK tax year means that Britons finally face many of the additional charges imposed in the two 1993 Budgets. A 1 percentage point rise in employees' National Insurance payments and the reduction in relief on the married couple's tax allowance will have the biggest effect on pay packets. The imposition of value added tax on fuel and the reduction in mortgage interest tax relief have already begun to take effect. Banesto deadline This is the last day for banks to register as potential buyers of Banesto, the troubled Spanish bank which is due to be auctioned. Sealed bids will have to be submitted by April 25. The front runners in the auction - Argentaria, Banco Santander and Banco Bilbao Vizcaya - have already registered.  .TX- Danish bond issue  .TX- Denmark will become the latest European sovereign borrower to lengthen the maturity of its bonds from 10 years, by introducing a 30-year government bond with a 6 per cent coupon. Since the bonds will be sold on a 'tap' basis it is not clear how much the Danish government intends to raise through this offering. Traders say the bonds will not remain liquid for long if the government issues less than DKr12bn-DKr15bn worth. The market is also unsure about the proposed pricing of the bonds. Traders are basing their forecasts on the yield differentials between 10-year and 30-year government bonds in France, the Netherlands and Germany where the spreads range from 50 basis points to nearly 70 basis points. Some traders expect Denmark's 30-year bond to yield just over 60 basis points over the 8 per cent bonds due 2003 which were yielding around 6.90 per cent late last week. Nazarbayev in Japan Kazakhstan's President Nursultan Nazarbayev, who has attracted western investment to help develop his country's rich oil and gas reserves, goes to Japan for a four-day tour. Nazarbayev, whose globe-trotting has enhanced his reputation as the leader of one of the more stable regimes in the region, recently called for the former Soviet Union's transformation into a Euro-Asian union. FT Survey: Dorset Hurd arrives in Brasilia British foreign secretary Douglas Hurd comes to Brasilia for talks after arriving in Brazil on Tuesday. He is due to stay until Friday, when he will fly on to the Falkland Islands. As well as cementing growing economic ties, Hurd may sign an extradition treaty. This is, however, unlikely to lead to the extradition of Ronnie Biggs, the escaped train robber, who lives in Rio de Janeiro. Balladur in Beijing Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, will travel to Beijing for a four-day visit aimed at setting the seal on improved relations between France and China. The visit follows France's announcement in January that it would no longer sell arms to Taiwan, a long-standing source of friction. UK economic figures UK manufacturing output and industrial production figures for February are unlikely to be as strong as they were in January, which saw month-on-month rises of 1.1 per cent and 0.8 per cent respectively. The figures are very volatile and some analysts are accordingly expecting manufacturing output to have fallen in February. However, recent Confederation of British Industry surveys have been positive and the average forecast is for manufacturing output to have risen 0.4 per cent and industrial production 0.5 per cent, indicating a continuing UK recovery. German jobless statistics In the middle of this week Germany releases March's unemployment figures. Observers are expecting the jobless numbers to rise further towards the 4.5m figure which Ulrich Castellieri, a Deutsche Bank board member, forecast for the end of this year. Although seasonal factors might affect the short-term outlook, the consistent upward trend can be counted on, if only because most of German industry - including the banks - are still in the middle of their rationalisation programmes. US Masters The Australian golfer Greg Norman should be the favourite to win this prestigious tournament in Augusta, Georgia (until 10 April) after clinching the Players Championship last month. FT Surveys: Danish banking and finance; International hotels. South African summit ANC leader Nelson Mandela, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the Zulu Inkatha party, Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini and South African President FW de Klerk will meet to try to resolve the impasse over Zulu participation in the April 26-28 election. The Zulu leaders demand guarantees on the king's status after the elections. Mandela and de Klerk seek Inkatha's agreement not to impede voting in Natal, which includes the Zulu homeland, KwaZulu, run by Inkatha. A state of emergency was declared in Natal last Thursday to try to control the escalating violence between ANC and Inkatha supporters. EU finance meeting European Union finance ministers meet in Athens for two days of informal talks. The main items on the agenda will be the operation of the European Monetary System and the prospects, if any, for a return to the old narrow fluctuation bands for member currencies; the financing of the trans-European networks in road, rail, telecommunications and energy; and the prospects for further cuts in European interest rates to lift the continental economy out of recession. Friendship Bridge opens The first bridge across the lower Mekong river will be officially opened by Australian prime minister Paul Keating, marking another step in the economic development of south-east Asia. The 'Friendship Bridge' linking Vientiane, the capital of landlocked Laos, with the northern Thai town of Nong Khai, was built with Australian aid at a cost of about USDollars 30m. Thailand and Laos expect the bridge to ease the increasing flow of tourists and trade between the two countries, although some Lao officials are worried that their once isolated country will become a truck stop between southern China and the maritime states of the region. Fourth Test match begins The fourth Test match between England and the West Indies begins in Bridgetown, Barbados (until 13 April). England's cricketers hope to salvage some pride after their disastrous batting collapse in the last Test, which gave West Indies the series. FT Surveys: Paints and the Environment; East Kent; Switzerland Argentina goes to the polls Voters in Argentina go to the polls on Sunday to choose a constituent assembly that will rewrite the country's 1853 constitution. Lifting the constitution's ban on consecutive presidential terms will allow President Carlos Menem to run for a second term in 1995. The polls forecast an easy victory for Menem's Peronist party. Ukrainian election run-off Ukraine faces a complete gas cut-off on Sunday as its citizens return to the polls for run-off elections for the nation's first post-Soviet parliament. Russia's Gazprom is demanding that Ukraine pay its near Dollars 1bn gas debt by Sunday. Ukraine is scrambling to put together a barter package of cars, food and machinery for Russian oil and gas. There is also a proposal to clear Ukraine's debt by giving Russia a stake in its gas industry. The Grand National Britain's most famous steeplechase takes place at Aintree, near Liverpool, on Saturday. Last year's race ended in chaos after a false start when several jockeys completed the course ignorant of attempts by officials to stop them. Gatt pact to be signed The long-delayed final act of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade Uruguay Round trade agreement is due to be signed on Tuesday, 12 April, in Marrakesh, Morocco. Trade ministers will be meeting from Monday to Friday and the US wants discussion to focus on the link between workers' rights and the world trading system. The signing will come a few days before the expiry of the 'fast-track' negotiating authority extended by Congress to President Clinton in April 1993. Under this procedure Congress must accept or reject a proposed trade agreement, and may not substantially amend it. Israeli pull-out deadline April 14 is the deadline for Israel to pull its forces out of the Gaza Strip and Jericho in the occupied territories. Recent progress in the talks between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation has meant this date may be met, though there is still disagreement over the size of the Palestinian police force.

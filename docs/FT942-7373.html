			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Work starts on Leuna plant Chancellor Helmut Kohl yesterday inaugurated construction in eastern Germany of one of the region's most modern oil refineries which is backed by Elf-Aquitaine, one of France's largest oil companies. The Leuna plant in Saxony-Anhalt is being built by a consortium headed by Elf Aquitaine, Rosneft, the state-owned Russian oil company, and Thyssen Handelsunion, a subsidiary of Thyssen, the German steel group. The consortium is investing more than DM4.3bn (Pounds 1.7bn) in the plant which will take three years to complete. The project nearly collapsed earlier this year after Elf decided to sharply reduce its stake to a minority holding, causing considerable embarrassment to Mr Kohl who had been persuaded by President Francois Mitterrand to give Elf access to petrol distribution and refining in eastern Germany. The project was salvaged after the Russians secured a stake at the refinery. Mr Kohl said the refinery represented 'a milestone for German-French co-operation' and 'symbolises the thorough change in our relations with Russia.'</p>

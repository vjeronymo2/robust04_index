			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (14): The engagement of money and finance THE NEW PALGRAVE DICTIONARY OF MONEY AND FINANCE Edited by Peter Newman, Murray Milgate and John Eatwell The Macmillan Press, Pounds 350 for three-volume set A GOOD NEW dictionary must fulfil three functions. It should inform, it should entertain, and it should stimulate new ideas by the freshness of its presentation and approach. The New Palgrave Dictionary of Money &amp; Finance, a three-volume heavyweight checking in at more than 2,500 pages, scores highly on the first two counts, and rather less certainly on the third. In the short time that it has been on my shelves, I have startled strangers with the depth of my recently acquired knowledge about the history of the Federal Reserve System. I have politely corrected a normally much better informed colleague about the record of the Super Bowl stock market predictor. I have found the answer to questions about the workings of monetary policy which I was too embarrassed to ask 20 years ago. The dictionary is built round more than 1,000 substantial essays written by more than 800 authorities from around the world, covering both the domestic and international aspects of money, banking and finance. As well as theory and doctrine, it also covers more empirical matters such as institutional analysis and the workings of financial regulation, together with the history of institutions, events and ideas. It is out of the same stable, and has the same editors, as the New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics published five years ago. The main geographical focus is on North America and the US, with two thirds of its contributors coming from the former region and a fifth from the latter. But efforts have been made to cover the monetary and financial systems of about 30 other countries, and Japan gets thorough treatment. When it comes to entertainment, the new dictionary is too big and too expensive for bath time reading. And some of its entries are daunting: the explanation of intertemporal portfolio theory and asset pricing, several pages long and laced with equations, is one of quite a few entries which are not for the faint hearted. But it is a real pleasure to browse through these volumes and come unexpectedly across an elegant essay on money by James Tobin, a sour piece on financial zoos by First Boston's Albert Wojnilower, or a full profile of the Bank for International Settlements by Alexandre Lamfalussy. Most entries are followed by a bibliography and there is a useful series of cross references to send readers to relevant essays elsewhere in the text. But will the dictionary achieve more than this? The editors' big idea is that it will help to bring together the study of the subject 'money'  - usually located in departments of economics in faculties of arts or social sciences - with that of the subject 'finance', which is more usually to be found in the universities' professional or business management school. They recognise that the subjects have converged in recent years with, for example, monetary theory being strongly influenced by an improved understanding of the workings of efficient financial markets. But the process has further to go. Only belatedly did the UK treasury come to understand that the process of financial deregulation had played havoc with the assumptions on which it had attempted to manage monetary policy during the 1980s. Perhaps the new dictionary will help. The editors hope at a minimum that it will make financial economics more important in the training of general economists. But it seems unlikely that such a densely structured work will have a broader impact on the thinking of policy makers, academics and market participants.</p>

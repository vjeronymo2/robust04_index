			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / Survey of the Canary Islands (7): Study in contrasting styles / Explore the eastern islands FUERTEVENTURA: The Spanish poet Miguel de Unamuno described Fuerteventura as 'an oasis in the midst of the desert of civilisation' when he was exiled there in 1924. Today, Fuerteventura can truly be described as one of the 'Fortunate Islands' in that it is relatively free of package tourists. The islands are home to more than 3,000 members of the Spanish Foreign Legion, whose reputation concedes nothing in toughness to that of their French counterparts. The legion was originally based there with the purpose of keeping an eye on King Hassan II of Morocco, who in the mid-1970s successfully and peacefully invaded Spanish Sahara and recovered the territory. The troops generally keep a low profile; the islanders do not have a great love for them. The second largest island of the group, at 1,725 sq km, Fuerteventura is a desert-like place whose capital, Puerto del Rosario, is a stepping-stone for the thousands who visit the island each year for its sun and sand. Pale Europeans riding on camels, soaking up a touch of Africa, mingle with the island's fishermen; Fuerteventura hosts some of the best of the Canaries' fishing. But although surrounded by water, the island still has to import much of its drinking water from mainland Spain. Rainfall generally comes to the island only once a year in a downpour which may last only one night. Mass tourism has not yet defaced Fuerteventura as it has some of the other islands; there are only 14,000 beds available to tourists on the whole island, a small proportion of the Canaries' total. That will change by the end of this year, when the Pounds 200m, 62 acre Puerto Ventura project and a 9,000 bed hotel complex opens. A village complex of hotels, apartments and entertainments, the development is a Swiss project by a Zurich based company, Alpha Generalunternehmung. The man behind the scheme, Mr Werner Bleiker, has convinced the Canarian authorities that his village will offer Swiss quality with Spanish culture. LANZAROTE: The volcanic arid island of Lanzarote (795 sq km, population 54,000) has become irrevocably linked in the minds of millions with cheap package holidays - the 'lanzagrotty' of down market sun-worshipping. Not for nothing has the island developed the myth - which may be true - that two BBC television executives dreamed up the soap opera 'Eastenders' while taking in the sun on Lanzarote; some 600,000 tourists come to the island each year. That does an injustice to the island's natural beauty and scenic attractions. But the bad image of the island has much to do with the down-at-heel appearance of the principal town, Arrecife. The wise traveller leaves Arrecife as soon as possible and heads off for places such as the Timanfaya National Park, a reserve which is doing its best to maintain in an unspoilt condition one of the world's youngest volcanic landscapes - the last eruptions were in the early 18th century, and covered a quarter of the island's most fertile land in a layer of lava between 6 and 10 metres deep. The heat generated is such that bushes still spontaneously combust and potatoes can be cooked by burying them just beneath the earth's surface. GRAN CANARIA: With 700,000 people living and covering an area of 1,533 sq km (making it the third largest island in the group), Gran Canaria is both the seat of government for the autonomous region and the most popular tourist destination within the islands. Its capital, Las Palmas, is both a major port and the centre of one of the island's most famous resorts, Las Canteras. But the Playa del Ingles and Maspalomas are equally well-known among the hundreds of thousands of British, German and Scandinavian tourists. Gran Canaria has been pillaged for tourist attractions, its coastline littered with ugly and badly designed mass-market resorts. Las Palmas retains an authenticity lacking in many of the ready-mixed resorts, thanks to its necessarily retaining all the functions of a working capital. Las Palmas was used by General Franco as his launching post for the 1936 Spanish revolution against the Republican government, which had exiled him to the islands following suspicion that he had been plotting a coup d'etat. Local wits say that the Canaries have only committed two errors; the first was to prevent Nelson winning the battle of Tenerife, the second, allowing Franco to leave.</p>

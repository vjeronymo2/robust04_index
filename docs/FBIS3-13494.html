			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "An Exposed U.S. Position"] </F>   [Text] Once again the Security Council deliberations over  the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre and the procrastination in  approving clear resolutions on this issue demonstrate the extent  of the U.S. Administration's full bias in favor of Israel's  leaders as well as its adoption of and total agreement with  their positions.    Perhaps what exposes this bias is the U.S. stance on  Jerusalem and the refusal to vote on a resolution that considers  Jerusalem to be part of the occupied Palestinian territories.  This, under the pretext of not interfering with what has been  agreed on in Oslo, namely that discussion on the Jerusalem issue  will be put off until the final stage of the talks.    With this unsound stance, the U.S. Administration is backing  down from its previous position on Jerusalem, which considered  the city to be an inseparable part of the occupied territories.  At the same time, the U.S. Administration is ignoring the fact  that talks over implementing the Oslo accord should be carried  out with the aim of applying Security Council Resolution 242,  which stipulates the inadmissibility of occupying the lands of  others by force. Clearly, this resolution applies to Jerusalem  as well.    Furthermore, the U.S. Administration's excuse about not  interfering with what has been agreed on in Oslo is a very  flimsy pretext, because all the evidence and facts indicate that  the United States is constantly interfering in the details of  what is happening in our region -- and always to the advantage  of Israel's leaders.    There is no better proof of this than the U.S.  Administration's position on Jerusalem and the recent Security  Council discussions, as well as its invitation to resume the  talks in Washington in a bid to deflect the massacre's  repercussions and neutralize any position opposed to keeping the  settlements in our occupied territories.</p>

			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> AILING COMPCARE OF IRVINE OKS OFFER TO MERGE  </P> <P> The acquisition of Comprehensive Care Corp., the nation's largest provider of  hospital drug- and alcohol-treatment services, by First Hospital Corp. was  approved Wednesday by shareholders of both companies.  </P> <P> At a special meeting to approve the $110-million deal, CompCare Chairman B. Lee  Karns told shareholders that the Irvine-based company needs First Hospital's  management capability and access to capital.  </P> <P> The new company will be known as FHC-CompCare Inc. and will have headquarters  in Virginia. It will employ 7,000 people, own $367 million in assets and  generate about $311 million in annual revenue.  </P> <P> Dr. Ronald I. Dozoretz, First Hospital's chairman, said he expects to gradually  cure CompCare's declining profits by eliminating CompCare's $15-million annual  media-advertising budget, emphasizing "hands-on" community marketing and  offering a wider menu of treatment plans.  </P> <P> As part of the merger, Karns will step down as chairman and Dozoretz will serve  as chairman and chief executive officer of the combined companies. Karns will  serve as a member of FHC-CompCare's board of directors.  </P></p>

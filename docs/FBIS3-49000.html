			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] From the cabinet of the president of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency we have just received President  Izetbegovic's letter to President of Croatia Franjo Tudjman. It  reads as follows:    Esteemed Mr. President: I reply to your letter of 23  December 1993. I agree that the humanitarian situation in  Bosnia-Herzegovina is very grave and this, it seems, is the only  thing we fully agree upon at the moment. We evidently perceive  some facts in relation to this situation in totally different  ways. First, your convoy for Nova Bila has reached its  destination. Our convoy has not reached Maglaj. This convoy is  waiting in hope in Zenica. You have been misinformed about this  matter.    It is true that the Nova Bila convoy was being considerably  delayed along its way but you are certainly familiar with the  reason behind this -- the military equipment hidden in it. This  is why I fail to understand your criticism of what you brand as  unjustifiable delays. It turned out, regrettably, that these  delays were entirely justified. On its way back the convoy  encountered problems because it was caught in crossfire near  Gornji Vakuf, where for months battles have been raging on a  daily basis. We regret the casualties but it was not us who  started this war in general or the one around Gornji Vakuf in  particular.    The Bosnia-Herzegovina army legally defends this town from  the Croatian Defense Council [HVO] paramilitary formations and  their attempts to take the town. They are responsible for the  destruction of this town and the deaths of hundreds of its  citizens. Every single word in the message, sent allegedly by  Djemo Merdan, deputy commander of the 3d Corps, is fabricated.  Our army does not kill women and children. What evidence do  you have to support such crude slander against the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army? I believe that it is entirely  inappropriate to include an unconfirmed and, I believe  fabricated statement in our correspondence.    As far as the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army is concerned, I want  to  be perfectly clear. The presence of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army  in every part of the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina is legal  and legitimate to the same extent the presence of other military  formations that do not recognize the supreme command of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency is unlawful and unacceptable. The  Bosnia-Herzegovina army cannot be an aggressor in its own  country. Only armies sent in from other centers withut  permission from the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency can be  aggressors.    Hence, the allegations made in your letter regarding the  Nova  Bila humanitarian convoy have no grounds. Nor do the  allegations about the Bosnia-Herzegovina army's conduct.    The following facts are, however, indisputable. First, the  field hospital donated by the South African Union to the  population of eastern Mostar has been waiting for as long as six  months in Ploce. It was stopped by Croatian authorities and is  now being slowly cannibalized. Who is irritated by a field  hospital? What is the justification for this inhumane act?    Second, in Medjugorje your forces confiscated and blocked  two  months ago two of our helicopters which had been sent in  agreement with UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] and given its  assistance to collect the wounded although Medjugorje is on the  territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Third, your police, in the course of the last campaign  against the citizens of Bosnia-Herzegovina in Croatia, without  any basis or explanation, confiscated 2,760 vehicles that were  the property of our citizens. This is a figure that can be  substantiated by documents in our embassy in Zagreb. The true  number of vehicles that were taken could only be larger.    We stated that the Croat authorities in Herzegovina founded  concentration camps and imprisoned in them tens of thousands of  innocent civilians. You have persistently rejected this  assertion as slanderous. A few days ago your minister of  foreign affairs, in a letter to the UN Security Council, boasted  that the Croatian authorities, and I quote, freed 5,600 Muslim  prisoners. How can prisoners be freed from camps that do not  exist?    I am intentionally not setting out here the historical  details of the conflict in Herzegovina that has been accompanied  by the brutal ethnic cleansing of the Muslim population in  Mostar, Stolac, Capljina, Livno, and other places, the  culmination of which was the barbaric destruction of the Old  Bridge [in Mostar]. Nor am I setting out here worrying reports  of the presence of significant elements of the Croatian armed  forces on the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina, something which  shows the open interference of Croatia in the internal affairs  of Bosnia-Herzegovina, because this is contained in our letter  to the Security Council.    Despite everything that has been said, and many negative  facts, I wish to convey equally seriously to you our sincere  interest in improving the relations between our two countries,  and in developing all forms of cooperation. For this to be  achieved, however, a true change in your policy toward  Bosnia-Herzegovina is needed.    Furthermore -- as I have stressed to you many times -- you  cannot expect us to improve relations by negotiating with people  who have been branded as executioners [djelati] of the Muslim  people. With my respects.    This is the content of the letter that Alija Izetbegovic,  president of the presidency, sent to Franjo Tudjman.</p>

			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / International Company News: Depressed domestic sales - Motors JAPANESE vehicle makers are struggling against a deeply depressed home market, as heavy depreciation charges eat into their earnings. The results for the 1992 financial year are expected to be littered with special sales of land and stocks to cover or reduce pre-tax losses. The yen's recent rise to about Y110 to the dollar will make exporting to the US unprofitable for many in the short-run. Nissan's shares have been outperforming the market in recent weeks on the strength of its aggressive restructuring programme launched in February. Mitsubishi has been the favourite among analysts, mainly due to its model range which is in tune with Japanese consumers' rediscovered taste for more conservative styling. The truckmakers Hino and Nissan Diesel may be the industry's main beneficiaries from a new public works programme. The company most likely to show a strong improvement is Suzuki, the small car maker, largely because it is well placed to exploit surging demand.</p>

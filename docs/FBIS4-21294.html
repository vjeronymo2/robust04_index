It demands of  them, among other things, effective policies for learning about  their clients, identifying parties involved in transfers of  large sums, exercising strict control over foreign currency  transactions, and identifying "suspect" operations.    It reminded the heads of private banks that these funds are  being laundered precisely to "conceal criminal or illegal  activities," such as drug trafficking and tax evasion.    It claimed that this laundering is done to hide the real  origin of the money, so that it may be used freely. Furthermore,  "it operates as a support service, allowing criminals to enjoy  the profits from their businesses." [passage omitted]    The CNB indicated that, in countries such as Mexico,  "narcolaundering" may be practiced involuntarily by banks,  because they offer a large variety of services and instruments,  such as cashiers' and travelers' checks, and electronic  transfers. These can be used to conceal funds accrued illegally.    In view of this situation, the CNB remarked, multiple  banking  institutions need to know how the money laundering systems  operate, and how they can detect suspicious operations. This is  necessary both to protect themselves and to continue cooperating  with the efforts being expended by the pertinent authorities for  prevention.    According to this public agency, the bank personnel can  cooperate to a great extent with the government's efforts to  avert this illicit practice. Of course, they will be obliged to  meet the established reporting requirements "in a timely  manner," and to adopt the guidelines stipulated in the pertinent  legislation.    The CNB noted that, on the management level, bankers must  cooperate in controlling and possibly solving the problem.  Hence, it "suggested" that they devise programs to meet the  following requirements:    To establish an internal monitoring system that will help to  prevent money laundering.    To ensure suitable training for bank personnel.    The CNB explained that what is entailed is having a good  bank  management that will "maintain suitable levels of discretion" in  its operations. This includes appropriate identification of  persons doing business with credit departments, as well as  demanding "professional, ethical" conduct on the part of bank  employees and officials.    It observed that all this certainly entails strict  cooperation with the judicial authorities, "within the bounds  established by the applicable laws."    This institution indicated that, in order to become fully  acquainted with clients, there must be a proper identification  of depositors and other users of bank services. At the same  time, measures must be devised for promptly detecting unusual or  suspicious operations.    In fact, financial brokerage institutions will have to spot  laundering activities and prevent them from being carried out  through transfers. If they cannot do so for reasons associated  with computerized systems, the National Banking Commission  recommends that the following be included in all payment orders:  a) name, domicile, and number of the person seeking the payment  order; b) the same information, but on the beneficiary's  account; c) identification of the first bank that accepts such a  payment order.    Private banking agencies will be required to prepare reports  on transactions in foreign currency made by, or in the name of  particular clients, "especially when they involve large sums,"  in the form of individual or combined transactions.    The official institution pointed out that, nevertheless, an  operation involving a large sum in cash does not necessarily  imply that illicit activities or foreign exchange contraband are  being committed. The banks must take into account the amount,  frequency, and nature of the transaction, "as well as the bank's  previous experience with the persons involved, whether they be  employees or clients."    In this connection, the CNB explained that there are  activities that could be suspected of laundering motives, such  as those carried out with "large sums" in cash, "deceptive"  transactions, the deposit or withdrawal of large amounts of  funds through electronic transfers; and, of course, teller  transactions involving considerable sums.    The National Banking Commission recommended that financial  institutions concern themselves with workers employed in banks  whose life style "is not in keeping with their salary," those  who "refuse to take vacations," and, of course, those linked  with sizable shortages of bank funds.    The members of credit institutions of any kind should  reinforce their connections with other banks, paying special  heed to "significant" changes in the normal pattern of  transmitting foreign currency among agencies.    The CNB stated that, when there are increases in the amounts  of cash handled, without a commensurate rise in the number of  operations, the banks will have to be particularly alert.    Finally, the National Banking Commission instructed bankers  to be very watchful of deposits made in the Central Bank "in  amounts that differ from those maintained in the other banks,"  or deposits made by those employed in other institutions of  similar size. And they must definitely suspect receipts showing  increases in the use of bills of small denominations, with no  indication of a decline in those of large denominations.</p>

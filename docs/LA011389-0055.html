			<p><P> January 13, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DARYL GATES' COURT FINE  </P> <P> I'm calling my lawyer to see whether it is possible to sue the City Council of  Los Angeles for deciding -- in closed session, yet -- not only to pay Gates'  $170,000 personal damage obligation but to appeal the judgment on his behalf at  the expense of the residents of the city. The City Council believes that the  chief's acts were within the scope of his city-paid duties and thus the  citizens should pay for his foibles.  </P> <P> But all this time and money could have been saved if only Gates, his minions  and others who are likely to exceed the bounds of decency through  overzealousness or prejudice would be required to buy, at their expense as part  of their jobs, insurance to cover the cost of their defense as well as any  damage awards against them.  </P> <P> Not only would this requirement bring us a better caliber of public servant to  begin with, but when those who water at the public trough realize that they  must pay the cost of this coverage and that if they're not good citizens they  may become uninsurable and/or they may cause the cost of coverage to escalate,  the abuses will grind to a halt and the good citizens will not have to suffer  any more than the cost of their paychecks.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, attorney Stephen Yagman should be accorded the blessings of every  citizen for insisting that the people of the city should not have to pay for  the acts of an employee who does not do what he was hired to do. We've been  punished enough in having Gates in office.  </P> <P> OLIVER BERLINER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

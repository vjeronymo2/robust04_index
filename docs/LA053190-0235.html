			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> U.S. NAVY HAVEN TO BOAT PEOPLE  </P> <P> Organized refugee smugglers have found a way to smuggle Vietnamese boat people  into Thailand by sailing them toward U.S. warships heading for Thai ports, an  Interior Ministry spokesman said today.  </P> <P> Spokesman Pathai Wichanpreecha said the ministry has observed that the  smugglers take Vietnamese refugees out to sea when U.S. Navy vessels are  scheduled to call on Thai ports.  </P> <P> "They seem to know in advance when the American warships planned to visit  Thailand so they could bring Vietnamese boat people out to the vessels," the  spokesman said. "The sea is so wide, they should not have met the warships so  often."  </P> <P> He said five U.S. warships have picked up 286 Vietnamese refugees at sea on  their way to Thailand since last June.  </P></p>

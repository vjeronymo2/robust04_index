			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Stable US inflation figures lift world financial markets The US economy grew strongly in the third quarter but inflation remained under control, giving a fillip to world financial markets yesterday. Gross domestic product increased at an annualised rate of 3.4 per cent in the July to September quarter, according to advance estimates released by the Commerce Department's bureau of economic analysis. This was slower than the second quarter's 4.1 per cent but much faster than the 2.8 per cent to 3 per cent growth anticipated by private sector economists. Although evidence of a still buoyant economy might have been expected to alarm financial markets, the signs of moderate inflation helped to lift bond and share prices. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 55.51 to close at 3,930.66, having triggered the trading restrictions on the New York Stock Exchange that automatically follow a 50-point move in one session. Bonds soared to send key 30-year bond yields below 8 per cent for the first time in a week. Wall Street's strength fed through to European equity markets, with the FT-SE 100 Index in London closing 54.2 higher at 3,083.8. In Paris, the CAC-40 index was up 2.6 per cent on the day, while in Frankfurt, the Dax index rose 1.9 per cent in after-hours trading. The GDP figures also buoyed the dollar, which rose 1 1/2 pfennigs to close in London at DM1.5094. Markets took heart from the implicit price deflator, which reflects changes in prices and in the composition of GDP. This rose by only 1.6 per cent, but was flattered by a sharp increase in import prices, which are not included in the domestic statistics. A more reliable inflationary indicator, the GDP fixed weight price index for domestic purchases, showed inflation remaining stable at an annual rate of 3.2 per cent. Personal consumption grew 3.0 per cent, after the second quarter's low 1.3 per cent rise.

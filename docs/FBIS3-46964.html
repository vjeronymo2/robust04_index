			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 7 (YONHAP) -- Japan proposed to North  Korea last autumn that they resume their negotiations on  normalization of diplomatic relations, suspended in November  1992, a senior official at the Foreign Ministry said Thursday [6  January].    "We proposed holding preparatory negotiations," he said.    This is a reversal of the Japanese Government position that  it would not propose resumption of negotiations because North  Korea one-sidedly broke them off. Tokyo seems to have changed  its position and made the proposition because it was felt that  postponing resumption of the negotiations recklessly was  undesirable in view of a possible breakthrough in nuclear  negotiations between North Korea and the United States,  according to diplomatic sources.    "Last autumn, a Foreign Ministry official officially asked  North Korean authorities stationed in a third country to have  preparatory negotiations with Japan for resumption of talks on  normalization of diplomatic ties," the Ministry official said.  North Korea has not answered Tokyo's proposition, he said.  Japan made the proposal as indirect aid to the United States in  its negotiations with North Korea on the nuclear problem, he  said.    "The Foreign Ministry could tap North Korea's position on  the  preparatory negotiations again if necessary," he said.    He had no comment on the results of North Korean-U.S.  contacts announced Thursday.    "It's too early to say anything about the negotiation," he  said. Blocking special inspections of North Korea's  non-declared nuclear facilities would affect the resumption of  Tokyo-Pyongyang negotiations, he said.</p>

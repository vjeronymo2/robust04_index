			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Britain's trade gap widens: Record imports push deficit to highest monthly level for 2 1/2 years RECORD IMPORTS in December pushed Britain's trade deficit to its highest monthly level for 2 1/2 years and inflated the annual current account deficit for 1992 to almost twice that of the previous year. The last full set of trade figures for six months showed the UK's visible trade gap widening to Pounds 1.74bn in December as the value of exports fell and the value of imports rose to their highest ever level, boosted by the lower pound. The figures compared with a Pounds 1.41bn shortfall in November. The monthly deficit on the current account - which includes a Pounds 200m surplus on invisible items, such as financial services, government transfers and dividends - was Pounds 1.54bn, the biggest since June 1990. In spite of the poor figures, the government could draw comfort from the fact that the growth in export volumes outpaced import volumes in the fourth quarter. The figures were broadly in line with market expectations. But analysts said the sharp rise in imports reflected more than the effect of sterling's devaluation, prompting concern that the UK does not have the manufacturing capacity to close the trade gap when the economy recovers. The figures provided some evidence of recovery with strong growth in imports of consumer durables and manufactured components. The message was reinforced by news that the narrow measure of the money supply - notes and coins in circulation - is likely to breach the upper limit of its Treasury target range this month. M0 is considered by the Treasury to be a reliable guide to underlying inflationary pressures. According to estimates based on Bank of England figures published yesterday, it has risen by a seasonally adjusted 4.2 per cent this month compared with last January. The upper limit of the Treasury range is 4 per cent. The December figures from the Central Statistical Office rounded off a dismal year for the UK's trade position. In spite of recession - normally expected to depress imports - the current account deficit last year was almost double the size of the previous year's shortfall. In 1992 it ballooned to Pounds 11.8bn, with imports at a record annual high of Pounds 120.4bn. This compares with a current account deficit of Pounds 6.32bn in 1991. The deficit on visible trade was Pounds 13.77bn compared with Pounds 10.3bn in 1991. At Westminster, the figures prompted opposition attacks on the government's handling of the economy. Mrs Margaret Beckett, Labour's deputy leader, said 'the country is still in deep recession and deep trouble'. Mr Tony Newton, standing in for the prime minister, Mr John Major, at question time, accused Labour and the Liberal Democrats of talking down the economy when the conditions for recovery were in place. The UK and other European countries now face a gap in the publication of intra-EC trade figures as a new system for measuring trade data, in line with the single market, is introduced. Although export volumes are expected to pick up this year as UK goods benefit from the devaluation of the pound, most economists expect the trade deficit to deteriorate slowly over the year. The exact position will not be known until June when the CSO publishes the new set of figures. Export volumes, excluding oil and erratic items, slipped by 1.7 per cent month-on-month in December while imports rose by 1.3 per cent. In the fourth quarter, export volumes rose by 4 per cent compared with imports which rose just 0.5 per cent. Details, Page 7 Lex, Page 16</p>

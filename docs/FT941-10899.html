			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Survey of Emerging Markets (29): Investors spoilt for choice  -Specialist funds The investor who decides to back his or her favourite emerging market is spoilt for choice. According to Micropal's emerging markets monitor, there were nearly 500 emerging markets equities funds at the start of 1994. Twenty-one funds were devoted to Indonesia alone. These funds are often based in 'offshore' centres such as Luxembourg or the Cayman Islands to maximise their tax efficiency. The majority are denominated in US dollars, although some are in sterling and some in the local currency. Emerging markets funds fall into three obvious categories: the global, the regional and the single country. The former have been both extremely popular and successful; they have a number of attractive arguments on their side. The first is that there are simply so many emerging markets that it is difficult for individuals, or even institutions, to keep track of them all. It makes more sense to sub-contract the task to a specialist manager. The second argument is that individual emerging markets are highly volatile. By investing in a spread of emerging markets, via a global fund, one can reduce this volatility. This factor is reinforced by evidence which shows that emerging markets are not correlated with each other: in other words, there is no reason why the Brazilian and the Turkish stock markets should move in the same direction. Therefore, an investor can benefit from the phenomenon of greater economic growth, and therefore faster increases in corporate profits, without increasing risk. Regional funds also have some advantages for investors who do not feel confident enough about choosing individual markets in Asia or Latin America. Single country funds have a more mixed reputation. Inevitably, they will be more volatile than global funds. But they offer a focused investment route for those who want to back the growth of a particular market, say, Mexico in the wake of the North American Free Trade Agreement. The reputation of the single country sector was damaged by the establishment of a number of closed-end funds in the late 1980s. These funds, often based offshore but with a London listing, were designed to tap institutional investor enthusiasm for individual, usually Far Eastern, stock markets. Problems arose because such funds were often launched when an individual market was the height of fashion. In some countries, a few authorised funds represented the only route for outside institutional investors to gain exposure to the market. In their early days, some funds moved quickly to stand at premiums to asset values. However, when such markets subsequently fell out of favour, the asset value of the funds dropped. Furthermore, the closed end nature of these funds meant that investors could only sell their shares in the market. A combination of illiquidity, and out-of-favour markets meant that shares dropped to discounts to asset values. These could be as wide as 35-40 per cent. In the early 1990s, there were rumblings of discontent from some institutions, who felt that brokers were neglecting the needs of existing investors. Some believed brokers were interested only in the substantial fees available for launching funds; they were less concerned about doing something to rescue investors when their holdings stood at a discount. One or two attempts were made to unitise closed-end funds which stood at a discount, a device which would allow investors to realise their holdings at asset value. But the discount factor was also attacked by a number of predatory investors, who built up large stakes in funds at high discounts, with the aim of provoking managers into action and earning a handsome profit. A general narrowing of discounts followed, enhancing investors' returns at a time of generally buoyant stock markets. City of London Emerging Markets, a unit trust which specialises in buying the shares of single country funds, produced returns of 236 per cent over the two years to January 1, 1994, (offer-to-bid with net income reinvested: source Hardwick Stafford Wright) making it the best performing international growth trust over the period. It is also top of its sector over one year, and second over three and five years. Nevertheless, the volatility of the discounts in the single country fund sector inevitably raises the question of whether it is better to construct such funds on an open- or closed-end basis. An open-ended fund, constructed as a unit trust or mutual fund, avoids the discount problem. However, were an emerging market to crash sharply, the open-ended fund manager would have a problem. His investors would be rushing to redeem their holdings and he would have to offload stock on to an illiquid and fast-plunging market. The manager of a closed-ended fund can sit tight, however, since his investors cannot sell their shares back to him. In essence, the closed-end structure passes the liquidity risk on to the investor, in the form of the danger of a discount. However, the fans of closed-end funds argue that the freedom given to closed-end managers should improve their performance (and thus the return to the investor) in the long run. The debate could become louder if the Securities and Investments Board goes ahead with proposals to replace its list of approved securities and derivatives markets with a general duty on unit trust managers to ensure that the markets in which they invest meet certain criteria. The old system has restricted the freedom of UK unit trust managers to invest in certain emerging markets, and thus has limited the number of onshore single country funds. The new system may help pave the way to a plethora of Brazilian and Argentine funds, aimed at the British small investor.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Nikolay Styazhkin] </F>   [Text] Mineralnyye Vody (Stavropol Kray), 27 May -- As a  result of negotiations held during the night, $4 million were  handed over to the terrorists who had seized the bus with over  30 passengers near Mineralnyye Vody yesterday at about noon.  Having received the money, the terrorists released four more  hostages but they are still insisting that the sum of $10  million be delivered to them.    The four terrorists spent last night in the bus with tightly  closed doors on the territory of the Mineralnyye Vody airport.  They are holding 14 people hostage.    It is thought that early in the morning the terrorists took  turns taking naps while keepng a close eye on the hostages and  making sure that no one could approach the bus.</p>

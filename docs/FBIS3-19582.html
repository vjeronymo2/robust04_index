			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Our policy on the issue of The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia [FYROM] is firmly set out, and will  produce the expected results, said Prime Minister Andreas  Papandreou today. The prime minister was replying to  correspondents' questions as he left the Chamber of Deputies  where Greece's 150 years of parliamentary life was celebrated.    Replying to a question on whether he believes that the many  open fronts and dangers around us could develop into unfortunate  situations for our region, Papandreou said he does not think  anything like this could happen. If we have our eyes open and  are united with a common goal to protect the nation and our  people, he said, I think we can overcome all difficulties.  Responding to another question on whether he feels that some  are trying to increase the tension in the region with the topic  of the Turkish troops' participation in Bosnia-Herzegovina,  Papandreou said: There are always circles who seek division,  disorientation and promotion of their own interests, but I do  not think they will succeed in their mission. Replying to  another question, Papandreou said that our democracy has been  sheltered long enough to face the problems in our country now.</p>

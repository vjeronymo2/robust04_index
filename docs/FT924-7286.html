			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee pact chief calls for more co-operation COFFEE EXPORTING countries will have to co-operate much more than in the past if a future international agreement is to be successful, African coffee producers were told yesterday. Mr Alexandre Beltrao, chief executive of the International Coffee Organisation, said profound differences had existed in the domestic policies of coffee producing countries. He cited the level of prices to growers, financing, stock policy, quality standards, and marketing. This had led to permanent tensions, he said in a statement to the Inter-African Coffee Organisation yesterday. 'If such tensions and disagreements are to be avoided or minimised, some co-ordination of policies on price, financing and marketing needs to be established with guidelines agreed and monitored.' Mr Beltrao was unable to attend the four-day African meeting yesterday as next week sees a crucial meeting of the ICO in London. Delegates from both producer and consumer countries will be meeting to discuss a renewed coffee agreement at a time when world prices have started to recover from 20-year lows struck in August. Yesterday the January robusta contract rose Dollars 21 to a fresh nine-month high of Dollars 980 a tonne, partly on the back of Friday's sharp rise in New York after talk that Colombia's crop could be 10 per cent down on the 1991-92 level of 17.5m bags following of disease, drought and power cuts. World prices more than halved after the ICO export quota system collapsed in July 1989. This had cost African producers USDollars 3.2bn in the past three years, Mr Beltrao said. 'To put these figures into perspective net transfers. . . by the World Bank to all African countries south of the Sahara (not just coffee producers) in the three fiscal years to 1990 to 1992 totalled Dollars 2.9bn, ie less than the losses suffered by coffee producers alone.' The last ICO meeting at the end of September agreed on a definition for a universal quota system and last month a working group drew up draft rules for a system of controls. Progress could be maintained next week if producing countries were driven not merely by low prices, but by 'a disposition to work jointly in a new framework that will eliminate the pitfalls of the past and build up a healthy worldwide coffee industry protected from the vagaries of a speculative market,' Mr Beltrao said. The Brazilian Coffee Committee, which represents the private sector, has proposed that the government sell coffee stocks when the internal price reaches Dollars 90 a bag (60 kg), Dollars 20 above the present level, said Mr Suelly Evandro Amarante, head of the coffee producers' council, said yesterday, reports Reuter from Rio de Janeiro.</p>

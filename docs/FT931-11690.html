			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equities near peak in higher volume THE LONDON stock market appeared in no doubt yesterday regarding the developments of last weekend, when the UK prime minister denied press reports of an impending 2 percentage-point cut in base rates, while devaluation of the Irish punt threw the ERM currencies into turmoil. Investors took the view that economic growth remains the UK government's top priority, with weakness in sterling and the consequent inflation risks lower down the agenda. The fall in the pound, an immediate benefit to export prospects, brought strong gains across the range of the blue chips, and belief that rates will be reduced at Budget time in six weeks drove interest rate-linked issues ahead. Share prices rose sharply in another well-traded session. The FT-SE 100 Index finished at 2,851.6, within 10 points of its all-time high, and showing a gain on the day of 44.4, or 1.6 per cent. At the day's peak, the Footsie touched 2,854.5, pressing hard on the all-time high of 2,861.5 achieved on January 4 this year. Investment demand finally spread across the full range of equities, and the FT-SE Mid 250 Index kept pace with the FT-SE 100 to record a gain of 1.2 per cent at 2,988.8. Turnover in non-Footsie stocks, slightly higher than last week, constituted just over 64 per cent of the day's Seaq volume total of 793.4m shares. The weight of investment activity in equities was signalled again by a high retail worth of Pounds 1.51bn in Friday's session. Equity analysts appeared ready to see sterling renew its fall, perhaps to the DM2.30 area which, according to some currency specialists, would have the same effect on corporate earnings as a one-point reduction in base rates. The currency effect was most noticeable in the oil sector, which heavily outperformed the rest of the market. Close behind were the building material, property and banking sectors, all three likely beneficiaries from lower interest rates. Out of favour, on the other hand, were the utilities, where the switch to growth stocks coincided with uncertainty among the electricity gener-ating issues in the wake of political calls for aid to Britain's coal industry. Pharmaceutical shares continued to suffer as investors reacted to possible shifts in the US medical market under the Clinton administration. The equity market put aside worries about the impending weight of rights issues which had restrained it at the end of last week. The new share trading account, which opened yesterday, appears likely to be dominated by currency and interest rate factors rather than by apprehension over equity and gilt-edged funding. Nomura Research Institute said its analysts are now expecting 22 per cent growth in share earnings on UK stocks this year. They also expect market earnings estimates to improve as the year progresses. The past two weeks have also seen a return to high levels of equity trading volume, which now exceed even the levels recorded in the final quarter of 1992, themselves a substantial improvement over the thinly traded sessions suffered earlier in the year. Securities trading houses yesterday reported increasing volumes of private investor business, as well as the continuing flow of institutional trading.</p>

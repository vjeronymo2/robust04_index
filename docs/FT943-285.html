			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Australian current account deficit soars to ADollars 2.14bn Australia's current account deficit, seasonally adjusted, surged to ADollars 2.14bn (Pounds 1bn) in August, the largest figure since the beginning of 1990 and way in excess of market forecasts. The revised July deficit figure stood at ADollars 1.81bn, and most analysts had been predicting a similar figure for the following month. Although many of Australia's economic indicators have looked healthy in recent months, there has been persistent concern that the country could experience a 'blowout' on the balance of payments front. Merchandise exports rose by 2 per cent, or ADollars 123m, although non-rural exports remained below the level recorded in 10 of 12 months of the 1993/4 fiscal year. This rise, however, was more than outweighed by a 7 per cent increase, amounting to ADollars 412m, in merchandise imports. Government ministers immediately played down the significance of yesterday's figures. Mr Kim Beazley, finance minister, said 'monthly volatility in the data should be treated with caution', particularly given the large increase in imports of a few very costly unusual items that occured in August. However, Mr Paul Keating, prime minister, admitted the deficit was 'higher than we would like', although he also warned about reading too much into one month's figures. Both Mr Keating and Mr Beazley denied that the August balance of payments figures would put pressure on the federal budget, or immediately influence monetary policy. However, the Australian dollar came under selling pressure, and closed at Dollars 0.73825, compared with the previous close of Dollars 0.73985. The long bond yield hit a three-year peak, but steadied later. Meanwhile, Mr Alexander Downer, leader of the coalition opposition, warned that the effects of the severe drought, which has hit key east coast agricultural areas and is expected to hinder rural exports, had yet to be felt, and could compound a surge in capital investment-related imports.</p>

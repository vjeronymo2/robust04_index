			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Construction Contracts: City of London Underground plan BALFOUR BEATTY CIVIL ENGINEERING has been awarded the Pounds 1m contract to replace the pedestrian subway roof at Bank Station by London Underground. This is not the first time Balfour Beatty has been commissioned to work on this site. At the height of the Blitz during World War II, a bomb fell on the main ticket hall of Bank Station, demolishing the roofing and, by the use of steel troughing infilled with concrete, the station was quickly repaired and made operational. Now some 50 years on, above the roof lies one of the busiest road junctions in the City of London and because of the increased traffic, it has become necessary to bring it up to current loading standards. To facilitate this, the roof needs to be demolished and replaced. Also included in the works are repairs to the existing brickwork and waterproofing. To ensure the station is operational at all times, the year-long programme involves careful phasing of the works.</p>

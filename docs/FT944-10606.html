			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / International Company News: Economic recovery helps Trimac double profits Trimac, North America's biggest road haulier of bulk commodities and the world's fourth-largest contract driller, doubled profits in the first nine months of 1994. Trimac, controlled by the McCaig family of Calgary, said the gain stemmed from the north American economic recovery and a strong market for oil and gas drilling rigs. Exploration activity in western Canada, for example, was running at record levels. Third-quarter net profit advanced to CDollars 14.5m (USDollars 10.7m), or 36 cents a share, up from CDollars 9.7m, or 24 cents. Nine-month profit was CDollars 31.3m, or 77 cents, against CDollars 16.3m, or 41 cents. Revenues for the nine months were CDollars 495m, up 10 per cent. Trimac said third-quarter trucking results were firm and drilling revenues were up 47 per cent. Its equip-ment leasing business also improved. CAE, the world's biggest maker of flight simulators, continued its recovery in the second quarter, although the US military training division was hit by US defence budget cuts. Second-quarter net profit was CDollars 10.9m, or 10 cents a share, against Dollars 6m, or 6 cents, a year earlier, on revenues of Dollars 265m, up 5.3 per cent.</p>

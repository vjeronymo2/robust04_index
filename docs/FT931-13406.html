			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Sterling under more pressure STERLING continued to perform weakly against the D-Mark yesterday, falling as low as DM2.4370, following the release of poor economic data in the UK this week, writes James Blitz. The pound came under strong pressure in the morning as dealers speculated on the possibility of the Bank of England cutting base rates in the wake of Thursday's very poor unemployment figure for December. The currency recovered up to DM2.45 in the early afternoon, but later fell back to close in London at DM2.44, 1 1/4 pfennigs down on the day. It closed more than 1 1/2 cents higher against the dollar, at Dollars 1.5345. There were disturbing indications yesterday that the pound could go down to DM2.40, which many dealers see as the next important support level. One of the leading banking counterparties in the London market said that it had seen almost no interest in buying the pound from UK corporates on Thursday, and that there was barely any improvement yesterday. Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank in London, is among those who believe that the mood of the market towards sterling has changed significantly. He says that sterling could see DM2.37 within a month, but that it will rise up to the DM2.45 level afterwards. In his view, the January money supply figures, due out on February 3, will be crucial to the decision on whether to cut rates. A meeting of the 'seven wise men' who advise the UK Treasury, on February 9th, will also be important. 'They will come out in favour of a cut in base rates,' he said. However, Mr Steven Hannah, head of research at IBJ International in London, said that the money markets were now virtually discounting a full percentage point off base rates before the March budget, and that the UK authorities could ease policy without depressing the pound any further. 'The only thing that might put pressure on the currency is if the rate cut comes too soon,' he said. The dollar also suffered a new bout of weakness against the D-Mark yesterday, dropping below the DM1.60 level against the D-Mark for the first time this year. It closed at DM1.59 in London, down 2 1/2 pfennigs on the day. The dollar's fall came on the back of a mixed set of economic data. A strong 5.5 per cent rise in December housing starts raised hopes for good GDP growth in the fourth quarter. However, jobless claims rose 17,000 in the week to January 9, fuelling concerns that employment and incomes were growing too slowly.</p>

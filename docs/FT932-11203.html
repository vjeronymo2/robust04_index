			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / International Company News: IBM personnel chief retires MR WALT Burdick, senior vice-president in charge of personnel at IBM, is to retire at the end of May after 38 years with the company. IBM did not name a successor to Mr Burdick. Industry analysts believe the personnel director will be critical to a successful transformation of IBM because the company must boost employee morale while cutting thousands of jobs. Dell Computer, the US PC maker, has promoted Mr Joel Kocher, US president of operations, to oversee worldwide sales, marketing and service operations, in a senior management shake-up. The company also said Mr Andrew Harris, president of Dell International, had resigned.</p>

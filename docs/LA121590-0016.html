			<p><P> December 15, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THERE AREN'T ENOUGH DRAVECKYS ANYMORE  </P> <P> The sports pages are filled almost daily with stories of whining,  multimillion-dollar-salaried baseball players, many of whom in another era  would not have been worthy enough to put on the uniform of a major leaguer, let  alone become one.  </P> <P> About the time one is ready to sour on the game for good, there comes another  chapter in the heart-wrenching saga of Dave Dravecky (Dec. 7).  </P> <P> If we are to use attendance figures and those insane salaries as a barometer,  the game has never been healthier.  </P> <P> Reality is, however, that types like Hall of Fame human being Dave Dravecky are  fast disappearing from the scene. With their departure, one is hard-pressed to  come up with a valid reason to maintain a passion for what is no longer "the  Grand Old Game."  </P> <P> DICK BANK  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

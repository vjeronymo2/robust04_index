			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / UK Company News: LBC saved but Crown goes into receivership THE FUTURE of LBC, the London talk radio station, has been secured for the rest of its franchise period, but its parent, Crown Communications, has gone into receivership with debts of Pounds 16m. LBC has floated clear of the wreckage and effective control has passed to Chelverton Investments, whose main shareholders are Mr Matthew Cartisser and Mr John Porter. Mr Porter is the son of Dame Shirley Porter, the controversial Conservative politician and Sir Leslie Porter, the former president of Tesco. The deal, which will take care of about 80 per cent of the Crown debt, values LBC at Pounds 14m, and a total of Pounds 7m new capital will be injected. Chelverton, which will invest a total of Pounds 2.5m - Pounds 500,000 now and Pounds 2m if LBC regains its franchise - will have 49 per cent of the equity with an option to go to 51 per cent. Much of the remaining equity is held by Crown's bankers, ANZ and the Bank of Scotland, in exchange for debt. 'For the first time we can offer LBC security for the future. We will keep LBC on the air and successfully regain its franchise,' Mr Porter said after months of negotiations finally ended in a deal. The London commercial speech franchise is expected to be advertised within the next couple of months by the Radio Authority. The current franchise runs out at the end of 1994. Neither LBC nor Independent Radio Sales, another Crown subsidiary, are in receivership. The end of the road for Crown was triggered by the decision of the CSA, the French broadcasting authority, to block the sale of its French radio station, RFM, in a deal that would have been worth some Pounds 3m. In the absence of a sale to a consortium that included another French radio group, NRJ, Crown's banks decided they could no longer support the group. Administrators from Arthur Andersen were called in at 10pm on Wednesday. The joint administrators, Mr Murdoch McKillop and Mr Martin Fishman, said they would be meeting with all parties as soon as possible. Mr David Haynes, the Crown chief executive, said last night that the company was taking legal advice both on the decision made by the CSA and about statements made by the French broadcasting authority. The CSA had claimed Crown built up its stake in RFM to 70 per cent, contrary to French law. 'We have been sellers for a whole year, and to say we have been trying to build our stake flies in the face of all reality,' said Mr Haynes, who insisted last night that Crown had never had more than 49 per cent of the voting shares of the French station. The Crown chief emphasised that the CSA had been kept fully informed of the shareholding position throughout. Mr Murdoch McKillop, the joint receiver, will go to Paris on Monday to see what can be salvaged from the RFM station, which is still on the air. It is thought unlikely that Crown will survive as an entity and that instead the remaining businesses, such as IRS and Business Information, which produces corporate videos, will be sold. Mr Christopher Chataway, the Crown chairman who is also chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority, is expected to remain chairman of LBC for the immediate future and Mr Charlie Cox will remain station manager. Mr David Haynes, chief executive, said last night he would be staying with LBC. He added that on the question of the CSA decision and statements made by the French regulatory authority, it had been fully informed at every stage about RFM's ownership. Less than three years ago Crown was trading at 250p. When the share price was suspended last year pending the LBC deal it stood at 8p.</p>

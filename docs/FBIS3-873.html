The  party was created on 1 March and was granted a license by the  appropriate department.    In a political statement to the press, ARDP Chairman John  Milala Mbono-Mbue explained that the ARDP gives priority to  national economic integration and productive efforts aimed at  ending the current crisis which the country is going through.  He called on all Zairian politicians to rise above  self-interest and to leave no stone unturned in putting the  country back to work. Furthermore, the ARDP leader called for  the launching of a nation-wide mass education campaign to atune  the masses to the new democratic process and to enable them to  take charge of their own affairs.    The ARDP chairman is assisted by Massoli Molo and Matamo  Kuaka as vice chairman and secretary general, respectively.</p>

			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Dubbing actors strike for a slice more of the action Talk is cheap. Too cheap, claim the actors who dub foreign films and television programmes for French audiences. Actors belonging to the three unions which represent France's dubbing artists have been on strike since Tuesday. They want recognition of their intellectual property rights which, they believe, entitle them to payments for repeats and reissues of films, television series and videos. The stoppage threatens television and film companies and at least one major film, Kenneth Branagh's Frankenstein, faces a potentially serious hitch in its preparations for the French market. 'The unions are holding us hostage,' said one official of the Chambre de Doublage et de la Synchronisation, the industry association for France's dubbing companies. All is not lost. A meeting tomorrow between union members, film and television companies and the industry body, is aimed at resolving disagreements and restoring the voices to foreign television stars and Frankenstein. But the various parties will have to solve a complex and protracted dispute. The actors claim that a law passed in 1985, which took effect in 1986, upholds their intellectual property rights and entitles them to be consulted and remunerated before their work is re-broadcast or re-sold. 'We own our interpretation of a role,' said Mr Jimmy Shuman, an actor and a member of the Syndicat Francais des Artistes-Interpretes, one of the actors' unions. He claims that a new collective agreement between the actors and the dubbing companies, signed in April, allowed for negotiations on additional payments for re-broadcasts. The failure to arrange negotiations and the 'ambiguous response' from management and industry companies forced the industrial action, Mr Shuman said. The dubbing companies and their clients have been taken by surprise. 'We were not expecting a strike,' said Mr Jacques Orth, president of the Chambre Syndicale. He denied that actors had an automatic right to repeat fees, and said that the complex legal issues about property rights needed government clarification. Mr Orth believes the current stoppage could be damaging for the French dubbing industry. 'Major film companies will be tempted to go elsewhere, maybe to Belgium, Switzerland or even Britain.' The unions respond that this possibility is blocked by a decree that non-European films must be dubbed in France for the domestic market. If the legal arguments are unclear, so are the financial implications. Neither the companies nor the unions have sought to quantify the potential costs, although some artists could have much to gain. 'If you take the case of the guy who did Hutch, in Starsky &amp; Hutch, then his work has been repeated eight times,' one union member said. But the stoppage may harden the attitudes of the dubbers. As one actor put it: 'With people staying at home, many will see their work being re-broadcast on TV, reminding them of the money they are losing out on.'</p>

			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Optimism over Christopher trip MR WARREN CHRISTOPHER, US secretary of state, completed his Middle East shuttle yesterday, declaring he had salvaged the Arab-Israeli peace process and made more progress during the trip than he expected. Israel, Lebanon and Syria endorsed Mr Christopher's optimistic assessment of his trip. However, in a sign of the continuing risks of violence in the region, Palestinian militants killed three Israeli soldiers in the occupied West Bank and Lebanese guerrillas pounded Israel's allies in southern Lebanon, drawing retaliatory fire from Israeli artillery. Mr Mordechai Gur, Israel's deputy defence minister, said Palestinian militants were trying to sabotage the peace process and hitting back for Israel's fierce bombardment of Lebanese civilians last week. In Lebanon pro-Iranian Hizbollah guerrillas fired 30 Katyusha rockets, Sagger anti-tank missiles and mortars into positions of the South Lebanon Army, Israel's proxy force operating in its self-declared security zone. The attacks, not covered by a ceasefire brokered by Mr Christopher last week, drew Israeli shells and tank rounds at villages, sending civilians fleeing for a second time in two weeks.</p>

			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets: Athens pauses after scaling new peaks - But opinion remains divided as to the market's next move After two months of frenzied activity, triggered by the flotation of six leading Greek construction companies, investors on the Athens stock exchange are pausing for breath. The Athens general index relinquished 0.4 per cent yesterday to close at 1,109, its fourth decline in five days. The index peaked at 1,194 on January 18, its best level for more than two years, although still well short of the bourse's all-time high of 1,684 set in July 1990. Brokers and market analysts attributed the fall to profit-taking by foreign investors, who drove the market up by some 20 per cent earlier this month, reflecting the current enthusiasm for emerging markets among US and international fund managers. The brokers estimate that institutional investors abroad accounted for at least 50 per cent of daily turnover, which has averaged more than Dr15bn (Dollars 60m) since the start of the year. The increased pace of trading is all the more remarkable given that average daily turnover in 1993 amounted to just Dr2.5bn. Yet opinions are divided about the market's next move. With the average p/e ratio at 20, Greek equities now look expensive, while overall economic prospects are gloomy. Greece shows few signs of emerging from recession, with growth for 1994 projected at only 1.2 per cent and the public sector deficit likely to worsen from last year's 13.9 per cent of gross domestic product. Mr Phaedon Tamvakakis, managing director of Hambros Hellenic Growth Fund, said: 'It is really quite hard to justify a continuing rise for the moment. The fundamentals are not encouraging and Greek equities no longer seem cheap.' However, Mr Yannia Tegopoulos, chief analyst at Midland Pantelakis Securities, sounded more sanguine. 'The rise has been based on liquidity rather than p/e ratios so far, and there is still lots of money around to be allocated.' With more than 30 Greek companies in a lengthening queue for listings on the bourse, there will be plenty of shares available over the next few months. The success of the construction sector listings, all heavily subscribed, has brought new entrants flocking to the market. The construction companies, all family-owned, were seeking funds to finance new equipment purchases and provide working capital as they prepare to bid for more than Dr6,000bn worth of infrastructure projects being co-financed by the European Union. Their example is being followed by other growth-oriented companies anxious to avoid high interest rates, still averaging above 20 per cent for working capital. Ms Katerina Ferentinos of BZW Hellas said: 'The market is now set to broaden considerably, with the arrival of companies from sectors that traditionally have shunned the stock market in favour of raising financing privately.' One such applicant is Teletypos, which controls Mega Channel, Greece's most successful private television station. Owned by a consortium of Greek newspaper publishers, the company intends to raise Dr10bn, including an international tranche of about Dr2.5bn. Two passenger ferry lines, Strintzis and Dane, keen to start rennovating their fleets ahead of the EU's deregulation of coastal shipping at the end of the 1990s, will be the first shipping concerns to join the bourse. At the same time, a number of blue chip companies are planning rights issues. Michaniki, until November the only big construction company on the bourse, has announced a Dr9.2bn rights issue. Credit Bank, the largest private bank, plans a capital increase of close to Dr30bn. The flow of new issues is likely to continue for much of 1994. Although the socialist government which came to power last October has radically curtailed Greece's privatisation programme, it still plans to float 15 to 20 per cent of OTE, the state telecommunications company, on the bourse this year.</p>

			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Observer: Piltdown purse And now, a word of warning to all those hapless European parents who have only just got around to junking Mutant Ninja Turtle, Batman, Jurassic Park (etc) T-shirts, pencil cases, underwear and so on, accumulated by their children from bygone ages. Go into hibernation now - the Flintstones are coming. The whole world - apart from Ulan Bator maybe - is about to be swamped with Flintstones' merchandising, coinciding with the release of a film based on the cartoon caveman characters. Turner Home Entertainment owns the rights; and wild pterodactyls won't stop the onward march towards merchandising sales estimated at Pounds 640m. And the profits? Prehistoric, by some US corporate standards.</p>

			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Survey of France (5): Not everyone can be a star - The next round of privatisations may be trickier The French government's privatisation programme is nothing if not ambitious. The four public sector groups already dispatched to the private sector and the 17 slated for sale over the next few years should bring more than FFr250bn to the state coffers - far beyond the anticipated receipts from other European privatisation plans. More significantly, the transfer of some of the country's most powerful financial and industrial groups, such as Elf-Aquitaine, the oil group, and UAP, France's largest insurer, should prompt a profound shift in the traditionally tight relationship between business and government. This is part of the government's incentive. 'We should not be in the business of making cars,' says Mr Gerard Longuet, industry minister, referring to his determination to privatise Renault. At least as important, however, are budgetary considerations. With the government's budget deficit targetted at FFr300bn this year, receipts from privatisation are necessary to curb pressures on the public purse. So far, the auction of the state's assets and the harvesting of receipts has progressed relatively smoothly. Elf, UAP, and Rhone Poulenc, the chemicals and pharmaceuticals group, have been sold since the hammer fell on Banque Nationale de Paris, the administration's first privatisation, in the autumn of last year. Demand from the French public and international investors, combined with a strategic pricing, has seen over-subsription rates of between two and four times for the various issues. But the easy part may now be drawing to an end. The sale of the state's silverware always looked likely to become trickier as the auction progressed. One-quarter of the way down the privatisation list, it is proving to be so. Part of the problem lies in the stock market conditions. The Paris bourse has lost more than 15 per cent of its value since its peak in February, as bond yields have surged higher. Most analysts expect some recovery in the second half of the year, but with most privatisation issues trading at or below their issue price, investors are adopting a more sanguine approach. 'There is still interest, particularly in the better-known companies,' says one analyst at a Paris brokerage. 'But there is also an awareness that there is little prospect of a quick profit.' But the increasing complexity of the privatisation programme also reflects the candidates themselves. The first four companies to be sold were, by and large, stars of the public sector. All were profitable, with dominant positions in their respective markets and reasonable expansion prospects. The same cannot be said for many of the companies lower down the list. Groupe Bull, for example, the computer group which is currently in the process of privatisation, has suffered losses of more than FFr15bn over the past three years. Pechiney, a victim of the depressed international aluminium market, reported a loss of FFr980m for last year. Air France, towards the bottom of the list, is fighting for survival after a deficit of FFr8.48bn in 1993, while Credit Lyonnais, one of the country's largest banking groups, will need to reverse a comparable loss before it can be sold to private investors. The complications are not just financial. Renault, one of Europe's most profitable car manufacturers, is faced with political obstacles to privatisation. The sensitivity of its sale, which springs from its historic role as a stronghold of trade unions and a spearhead of public sector industry, has combined with the collapse of its planned merger with Volvo of Sweden, to cloud its privatisation timetable with uncertainty. The government is considering a partial privatisation by the end of this year. In many cases, privatisation also depends on the implementation of restructuring measures. At Pechiney, the industry ministry has sought to merge the aluminium group with Compagnie Nationale du Rhone, a low-cost hydro-electricity producer, to render the company more attractive for sale. At Groupe Bull, industry partners, such as NEC of Japan or IBM of the US, need to be enticed to take or increase existing shareholdings to facilitate the computer group's shift to the private sector. Despite these various obstacles, the government of Mr Edouard Balladur has little cause to be alarmed. The successful sale of Elf and UAP this year means that the target of FFr55bn in receipts for this year has already been met - even without the estimated FFr15bn predicted from the sale of Assurances Generales de France, the insurance group which is next on the sell-off list. As a result, the government can afford to take its time in pushing the rest of its assets to market. Mr Balladur's economic officials can also take comfort from the level of international interest in the issues so far. Each issue has drawn strong demand from foreign institutional investors, seeking to take a share of French blue chip companies. 'We have seen a healthy appetite for French issues,' says one US fund manager. 'Many of our clients want to increase the weighting of European and French stocks in their portfolios and the privatisation is a good opportunity.' He notes, however, that the scaling down of share allocations to foreign institutions, resulting from clawback options for French individual investors, had caused some irritation. Industrial investors have also sought to acquire stakes, often as part of the so-called noyau dur of long-term stable investors. BAT Industries of the UK, for example, took a 0.5 per cent stake in BNP, in a move which most analysts see as a precursor to a more significant role by the British group in the privatisation of Seita, the French tobacco monopoly. The creation of a noyau dur for BNP, as for the rest of the privatisation issues, reflects the French government's strategy of easing its industrial assets into the private sector. The group of hard-core investors provide a measure of protection from predators and a degree of stability during the departure from state control. 'They are designed to create the minimum of security that is necessary,' says one economic official. 'The state cannot just abandon its companies to the private sector.' Maybe not. But if Mr Balladur can complete his privatisation targets, then the French state will be left with a much smaller public sector to feel protective about.</p>

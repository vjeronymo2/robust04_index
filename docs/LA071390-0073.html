			<p><P> July 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ITALIAN CITY SCURRIES TO PREPARE FOR FLOOD OF ALBANIANS;  </P> <P> REFUGEES: TOURISTS, TROOPS AND VOLUNTEERS BRACE FOR THE BOAT-LIFT. UP TO 5,000  PEOPLE ARE EXPECTED AT BRINDISI'S PORT.  </P> <P> An international legion of bronzed backpackers braved vacation plans gone  astray. Rail workers marshaled three of the longest trains ever seen in  peacetime Europe.  </P> <P> A platoon of Italian soldiers swapped its weapons for wire-cutters and  weed-trimmers. A Calabrian bishop in the Italian boot hustled volunteer  interpreters toward Brindisi from villages where Albanian has survived for  centuries as a local dialect.  </P> <P> Thus did this Adriatic port, and Italy with it, prepare Thursday for its first  direct encounter with the human consequences of collapsing communism in Eastern  Europe.  </P> <P> After watching, riveted for months, as a geography-insulated spectator while  revolutionary winds swept the East, Italy has been brought center stage by  trauma in Albania, a distant neighbor across the Adriatic.  </P> <P> Italian, French and German officials increased a boat-lift flotilla from three  vessels to five Thursday after it became clear that more Albanians than  originally thought were taking refuge inside their embassies in the Albanian  capital, Tirana.  </P> <P> In all, officials expected between 4,500 and 5,000 Albanians to embark on the  five chartered ferries late Thursday. The ships are due here this morning.  </P> <P> Albania's Communist leaders, scrambling to maintain control of Europe's last  stubbornly Stalinist state, agreed to the refugee exodus but ordered that it  come in the dead of night from the port of Durres, about 20 miles from Tirana.  </P> <P> West Germany alone expects 3,200 refugees, who have been dangerously jammed  inside its embassy, according to Friedrich W. Catoir, a German spokesman here.  One of the refugees was born Wednesday at the embassy. A number of others  require medical attention, Catoir said.  </P> <P> Three special trains stocked with food, medical personnel and German border  police wound their way from Germany, through Austria and down the Italian  peninsula to this port about 335 miles southeast of Rome on Thursday.  </P> <P> The plan was for them to leave almost immediately for Germany with refugees  aboard two chartered ferries that will dock about 100 yards from the train  station.  </P> <P> To accommodate them, European rules on the size of international trains have  been waived for the trip. The German locomotives will pull nearly twice as many  carriages as are usually seen in Europe.  </P> <P> About 500 refugees are expected on the ferry Orient Star chartered by France  from a company in Greece. Officials said the ferry would call briefly here and  then continue with the refugees to a French port, probably Marseilles.  </P> <P> Italian officials here said they thought the ferries might also bring about 500  Albanians who had found asylum in seven other foreign embassies in Tirana in a  stampede that began June 28.  </P> <P> To accommodate the influx, port officials ordered Brindisi closed to commercial  maritime traffic today, Prefect Giuseppe Mazzitello said. That will mean delays  for the hundreds of European and American tourists who wandered through the  port with backpacks and bottles of mineral water awaiting passage to Greece.  </P> <P> Lolling in the sun, they seemed neither particularly aware of the preparations  around them, nor upset at the prospect of delay.  </P> <P> For its part, Italy expects about 800 refugees from its embassy. Near the San  Vito U.S. Air Base outside of town, a disused Italian army depot was being  overhauled Thursday to accommodate them and up to 400 others. The Albanians  were to remain there less than a week before being resettled around Italy,  Mazzitello said.  </P> <P> Under the broiling sun at the camp Thursday, soldiers installed cots, bathrooms  and big kitchens. They whacked weeds, painted all that did not move and  clambered in brilliant yellow gloves atop foreboding walls to hack at rusty  rolls of barbed wire.  </P> <P> The Cold War wire, meant to keep out enemies, had been left to discourage  thieves and vandals. Clearly, it would not do for refugees from the tail thrash  of dying communism.  </P> <P> "We're taking down the wire because we don't want it to look like a  concentration camp," said Italian army Lt. Col. Michele Dodde.  </P></p>

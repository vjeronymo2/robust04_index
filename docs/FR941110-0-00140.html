			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two commenters said that, in the case of civil money  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> penalties, notice before an effective date is meaningless,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> since the fine may be imposed for a past violation that has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> already been corrected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter said that the ``not more than four days''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notice in &sect;488.402(f) conflicts with &sect;488.410, and another  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that paragraph (f) conflicts with &sect;488.330(e)(1)(i) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii). Another said that the clause, ``*&blank;*&blank;* the remedy could be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imposed anytime after the minimum 2 day notification period,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> but not later than the 10th day after the last day of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> survey,'' is confusing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, one commenter suggested that residents and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their representatives be notified of enforcement actions and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their implications at the same time the nursing home is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notified. Two other commenters said that States should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to compile, at least monthly, a list of facilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> against which they have taken adverse action and imposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sanctions. They suggested that this listing be sent to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> newspapers, to the State long-term care ombudsman, to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State protection and advocacy agency, to acute care  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospitals, and to public and private agencies that regularly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> make referrals of individuals to nursing facilities. They  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also suggested that States be required to develop poster  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notices for each intermediate remedy, and require facilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to post the notice in a prominent place.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We are revising &sect;488.402(f) to specify that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the time frames given are calendar days, and that they begin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> when the facility receives the notice, but in no event will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the effective date of the enforcement action be later than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 20 days after the notice is sent. We are not accepting the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggestion that the notices be sent via certified mail, with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> return receipt requested. This would preclude a valid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notice sent via other means, such as telefax, telegram,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commercial overnight delivery services, or other means that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may be faster. This becomes an especially important  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consideration in the case of immediate jeopardy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenter who asks for an expedited hearing process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> due to the short notice alleging immediate jeopardy seems to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be suggesting that the hearing take place before the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective date of a sanction to safeguard the facility's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ability to continue its business and protect its residents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from wrongful government action. In the case of immediate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> jeopardy, this would mean a hearing would have to be held as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> early as the first 48 hours after the survey. It is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entirely possible that, when a survey uncovers such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> jeopardy, the State or HCFA may immediately set an effective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> date at the minimum required time after notice, that is, 2  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> days. It is virtually impossible to set up a hearing this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quickly, and expanding the time between the notice and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective date of a remedy to make it possible to hold a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hearing before the effective date would not be in the best  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interests of the residents. The whole point of a short time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> frame is to safeguard the lives and the safety of residents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by taking immediate action. As discussed at proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;488.180 (now designated as &sect;488.330), Certification of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance or noncompliance, it is not necessary to hold a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hearing before the effective date of termination to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adequately protect a facility's right to due process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As noted above, we received comments saying our time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> frames were too short, and others saying that they were too  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> long. While we are mindful of the Act's requirement that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Secretary take immediate action in the case of immediate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> jeopardy (sections 1819(h)(4) and 1919(h)(4) of the Act),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and to minimize the time between the identification of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> violations and final imposition of the other remedies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (sections 1819(h)(2)(B) and 1919(h)(2)(B) of the Act), we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have chosen not to shorten them, except for the same day (if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary) installation of a State monitor in the case of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> immediate jeopardy. We believe that, for other available  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remedies when there is an immediate jeopardy deficiency, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility should be allowed at least 2 days before imposition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of sanctions. This is because we believe that even in cases  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of immediate jeopardy, providers are entitled to some notice  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> before the imposition of sanctions. We believe that, in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> case of non-immediate jeopardy, we should not allow any less  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than 15 days for similar reasons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

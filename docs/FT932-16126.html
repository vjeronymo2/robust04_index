			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / UK Company News: Isosceles restructure MR DAVID Simons, chief executive of Isosceles, used the pressure of worried trade creditors to speed up the restructuring process. If it had gone on much longer there was a risk that they might have refused to extend credit, knowing that Isosceles' debt standstill agreement runs out on May 28. In the event Mr Simons believes the restructuring is as good as he could have got. Yet questions remain about Gateway's future performance. The business plan forecasts that Gateway will record a Pounds 105m operating profit in the financial year to end-April, compared with a Pounds 187.4m profit in 1991-92. Profits are expected to fall again - by as much as Pounds 30m - before they recover. Although the expected interest charge of between Pounds 40m and Pounds 45m will be easily met by operating profits, it remains a drain on resources. Last year the like-for-like sales decline was 6 per cent steepening to 8 per cent in the past two months. The sales reductions in the core Gateway stores was in low double figures. Mr Simons blamed the sales decline on 'competitive attrition'. He conceded it was 'horrible' but remained confident that it would get better. 'We have five years in which to prove ourselves.' But most analysts do not believe there will be any significant improvement in the short-term. The 1992-93 figures will also bear interest charges, including rolled up interest, of Pounds 153m, and 'kitchen sink' provisions covering restructuring, property write-downs, fees for the refinancing and other items, taking the pre-tax loss to Pounds 335m. In response to the problems Mr Simons has reordered the investment priorities within the company. Most attention will focus on the 500 core Gateway stores. The Food Giant discount superstore chain will be doubled to about 40 stores, while the expansion of the Somerfield chain has been put on temporary hold. Mr Simons priority is to ensure the shops are properly stocked and pricing becomes more competitive. A rolling refurbishment programme of the main chain of stores is also underway. He plans to merge most of the different business units within Gateway's head office in Bristol to make a more efficient organisation. Even if the business plan proceeds as smoothly and efficiently as Mr Simons hopes, a possible flotation of the stores in three to five years in unlikely to raise more than Pounds 500m, although the company says it has no price in mind.</p>

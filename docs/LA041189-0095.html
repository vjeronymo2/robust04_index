			<p><P> April 11, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Vons Debt Rated: Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. has assigned a rating of B-minus  to $100 million of Vons' senior debt, and affirmed the B-minus rating on a  previous senior-debt offering of $245 million. Vons is a highly leveraged  company, and its earnings ability "remains somewhat vulnerable," but the  supermarket retailer is a solid operator and should overcome these difficulties  in time," S&amp;P said.  </P></p>

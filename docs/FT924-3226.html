			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Depressed economy needs shock therapy: Psychology and the recession THE UK is behaving like a depressed person immersed in the gloom of recession. The incentives offered by the government in the Autumn Statement are not enough to chivvy the nation out of its economic sluggishness. That, at least, is the diagnosis of a number of social psychologists. Collectively we are perpetuating the gloom of the recession, they say, with the media reinforcing harsh messages about the economy so that even people with safe jobs and financially secure homes have become nervous. This does not mean that cheerier news bulletins would jolt us out of our economic torpor. After all, the current lack of confidence reflects some brutal economic facts. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, has already learnt that attempting to talk the economy out of recession does not work. His promise in the autumn last year of 'green shoots' of recovery probably made things worse by increasing the cynicism among already wary consumers and businesses. Psychologists addressing the issue of consumer confidence believe it will be a while before the country can break out of its recessionary frame of mind. Dr James Thompson, senior lecturer in psychology at London University, believes we are heading for the decade of 'making do'. He says: 'At the moment people are frightened, confused and suspicious.' The classic 'freeze' response to fear has enveloped us as a nation. 'People have decided to cut their losses, pay back their debts and avoid frivolous purchases. In fact the cheapest thing to do is stay at home and watch programmes about the recession.' This retrenching behaviour makes sense to the individual because it maximises the feeling of personal security, but collectively it perpetuates the sluggishness of the economy. The insecurity, says Dr Thompson, is compounded by feelings people have that they have been conned by various statements about the economy. The government needs to address people's deepest fears. 'The message that it is all going to be all right is no longer believed,' he says. Caution among consumers is matched by extensive prudence in the financial and business world. Mr Nigel Nicholson, director of the Centre for Organisational Research at the London Business School, points out that risk-takers tend to retreat into the woodwork during a recession, leaving only the boldest of entrepreneurs to take risks. Here another vicious circle develops. 'Entrepreneurs go to banks which are peopled by non-risk takers,' Mr Nicholson explains. 'They become even more cautious during a recession, so it is very difficult to raise finance.' The problem of finding a way of pulling the UK out of its recessionary mind-set taxes psychologists. Mr Nicholson argues that emerging from the recession requires boldness on the part of people who are institutionally cautious, in other words bankers and other lenders. 'We can rely on entrepreneurs to get us out of recession, but only if they are supported by the people with the funds,' he says. 'Risk takers will still look for risks to take even in a situation where there are not many.' The success of the risk takers will gradually spread as more cautious members of society follow. He is confident the process will take its natural course. 'This will happen,' Mr Nicholson says. 'Indeed, we will probably look back and find it has already started. There are already people doing exciting and productive things in the economy.' Dr David Good, a social psychologist at King's College, Cambridge, is less certain. The situation has become too confused this time round for confidence to take its usual recovery course, he says. 'People's worlds have become muddied so that they no longer know the rules. They find they can be model employees but still lose their jobs.' Dr Good favours shock treatment as a remedy for the recession. 'If you want to change people's mentality, you have to do something big,' he says. 'It is no good cutting rates by a couple of points and buying up a few houses. But it is hard to see what would jolt us now.' One solution, suggests Mr Good, would be the classic Keynesian approach of spending on public works. 'If money is spent publicly it gets a wider appreciation and people's experience of public life - travelling, walking in the park, going to hospital - becomes less tawdry,' he says. 'They get a very real sense of life being nicer.' Dr Thompson is another exponent of radical change. 'One has to make quite a substantial change to make people confident again,' he says. 'I argue, as a psychologist, that the best way of getting confidence back is to show people there is a functional relationship between what they are doing and what the country needs.' In a fragmented economy this would not be an easy task, but Dr Thompson believes a switch away from service industries towards exportable manufactured goods would improve sentiment. In addition, national objectives would give people a greater sense of purpose - as it did during the second world war. But, fuel, food, housing and transport targets, are unlikely to become part of this government's policy. Meanwhile the authorities, with their three-point cut in base rates, devaluation and small fiscal tinkering, have administered roughly the equivalent of a couple of aspirin where electric shock treatment would be more appropriate. Many retailers have concluded there are no short-term solutions to the problems of the nation's damaged psyche and that we are in for a sober decade. Kingfisher, the stores group, has produced a report entitled Retail 2000, which examines the 1980s and considers the 'older, wiser and more cynical' consumer of the 1990s. 'No one has been immune from it, but the key 35-60 age group has been hit harder than most because they are the people suffering from the lingering effects of high mortgage rates and falling property values,' the report says. Kingfisher says the result will mean an ever more cautious approach to spending and a long period in which people live within their means and save more, and buy less on credit - and less on impulse.</p>

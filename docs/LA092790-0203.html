			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PREP FLASHBACK / THIS WEEK IN COUNTY PREP SPORTS HISTORY  </P> <P> 10 YEARS AGO  </P> <P> Running in the Shadows: Edison High was learning to live without running back  Kerwin Bell, who had graduated and went on to a successful career at Kansas.  Bell had led Edison to a Big Five Conference championship in 1979 and, despite  graduating the entire backfield from that team, the Chargers were ranked No. 1  by The Times at the start of the 1980 season.  </P> <P> In its third week, Edison struggled to defeat El Modena, 13-3. In that victory,  Bell's younger brother Dino gained 35 yards in 17 carries.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 5 YEARS AGO  </P> <P> The Times ran a series exploring the pressures placed on high school athletes.  One theory was the "Little League Syndrome."  </P> <P> Costa Mesa clinical and sports psychologist Richard Lister said the syndrome  occurred when parents tried to overcome their athletic deficiencies through the  glory of their children.  </P> <P> "There's a fine line between being zealous and being overzealous," Lister said.  "And when it happens, it kills the interest for the kids involved."  </P> <P> One notable parent that year was former Ram star receiver Jack Snow, whose son  J.T. was a quarterback at Los Alamitos High School.  </P> <P> "I do my best not to be an 'armchair quarterback,' " Jack Snow said. "You can  pick them out real easily -- they're usually the loudest."  </P> <P> Snow could have been excused for cheering loudly, though. J.T. Snow completed  12 of 22 passes for 259 yards and three touchdowns in Los Alamitos' 34-13  victory over Costa Mesa.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 1 YEAR AGO  </P> <P> Todd Gragnano and Erik Mitchell led Los Alamitos to a 42-8 victory over  Compton. Los Alamitos, which had been upset the previous week, scored 36 points  in the second half.  </P> <P> Mitchell had 106 yards and scored three touchdowns. Gragnano completed 16 of 26  passes for 248 yards and two touchdowns. Gragnano and Mitchell teamed on a  62-yard scoring pass play.  </P> <P> But the biggest numbers were posted by Rancho Alamitos' Dana Riddle. He carried  the ball 52 times for 248 yards and three touchdowns.  </P> <P> While Riddle was getting noticed for big numbers, Bolsa Grande's Sonny Nguyen  was getting noticed for little things -- his uniform. Nguyen at 5-feet-6, 120  pounds was the smallest starting varsity quarterback in the county and led  Bolsa Grande to a 16-14 victory over Pioneer. Nguyen completed six of 10 passes  for 122 yards and a touchdown, ran for one touchdown and kicked an extra point  and a field goal.  </P> <P> The little things counted for Marina too. It made a step in the right direction  by ending an 18-game losing streak with a 17-7 victory over Lakewood.  </P></p>

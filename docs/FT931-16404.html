			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / The Braer Disaster: Long-term fears 'may be unfounded' THE SHETLAND oil spill might kill thousands of birds in the next few months but studies of past disasters show that some environmentalists' fears about long-term ecological damage may be unfounded, scientists said yesterday. Mr Peter Taylor, of the Oil Pollution Research Unit, the Dyfed-based environmental consultancy, said: 'The Exxon Valdez (which foundered in 1989 off the Alaskan coast) shows that nature is a great recoverer.' The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds said last night that the bodies of 100 oil-covered birds had been recovered so far in Shetland and that it believed 10,000 birds could be at risk. The Shetland Islands are one of the UK's most important breeding grounds for seabirds and marine mammals, including nearly 800 otters, one of the largest groups in the UK. Many of the threatened birds are at sea but will return to nest within two months. The islands' 12,000 black guillemots, a third of the UK total, are beginning to arrive already. Mr Derek Niemann of the RSPB said: 'Guillemots are very competitive for the best space on cliff ledges and get clobbered by oil more than most other birds because they nest low down the cliffs.' Since the wreck of the Torrey Canyon off the south-west coast of England in 1967, much scientific effort has been devoted to assessing the environmental impact of oil spills, although US court actions have delayed the publication of some research. According to Mr Taylor, studies suggest that 'the effects last three months to 30 years, depending on the type of oil, the weather and the type of shoreline'. Although the light crude oil carried by the Braer evaporates more quickly than many other types, it contains complex hydrocarbons that are toxic to wildlife in many ways. Mr Paul Johnston, marine toxicologist at Exeter University, said: 'It poisons them by affecting their lung tissue if inhaled, or it is absorbed through the stomach into the blood and overwhelms the liver. Then between six months and two years you get more subtle effects, such as fish populations crashing because their larvae have been poisoned,' he added. 'Between two and 10 years you start to see more long-term effects - lesions on the bottom of flatfish or abnormal shell development in shellfish.' US studies of polluted waters such as the Great Lakes and Chesapeake Bay suggest that some chemicals in oil may be cancerous or cause genetic changes. A few may also bioaccumulate - they may stay in the organism's tissues without killing it, and so might be passed up the food chain, with eventual risk to human health, although several scientists emphasised that the tendency was many times smaller than with pesticides. Some long-term effects might be extremely hard to detect, Mr Johnston added. Although the wildlife numbers would eventually recover, 'you cannot obliterate that much of a community and expect it to regenerate exactly the same. The gene pool will be smaller, reducing the community's long-term ability to adapt to change,' he said. However, several scientists emphasised that long-term effects might be very small and the environment's own resilience underestimated. Waves and bacteria eventually break down oil and 'the conventional wisdom is that in 10 years an oil-fouled beach has cleared', Mr Johnston said. But experts are divided on the best techniques for treating the slick - and on whether treatment is effective at all. Greenpeace, the campaign group, last night criticised the decision to start spraying the Shetland slick with detergent. Mr Jeremy Leggett, Greenpeace scientific director, said that 'spraying just transfers the oil from the surface of the sea to the floor', with the risk of prolonging the pollution. While Mr Taylor agreed that 'the decision whether to use (spraying) can be complex', he added: 'I'm not against it, as it helps break up the oil into smaller particles.' Exxon's own report into the environmental impact on the Alaskan coastline a year after the spillage, which concluded that 'recovery was well under way', attributed that partly to the extensive beach cleaning operation, in which stones were individually scrubbed.</p>

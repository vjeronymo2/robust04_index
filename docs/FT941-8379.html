			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Fashion: The Global Wardrobe - Going Shopping / In the third part of our series on dress codes around the world, FT writers look at how the people of five major cities dress to go shopping Britain may no longer be the nation of shopkeepers Napoleon held in such low regard but it is certainly a nation of shoppers. It has embraced the American concept of shopping as recreation, hobby, part-time profession and all-absorbing topic of conversation. From department store to car boot sale, from designer boutique to Oxfam shop, the retail environment is home territory to Britons. So canny, so well-informed, in fact, are modern British shoppers that they have learned most of the techniques the marketing men use on them, and use them back. They do it chiefly through dress, grooming and manner. The weekly supermarket food shop, for instance, calls for dressing down, no lipstick and a diffident-aggressive manner. Flat shoes, jeans or a long skirt, an anorak or a Barbour make up the uniform. The shopping mall day out, rather like the car boot sale, calls for something altogether more rugged. It is here that the shell suit and trainers come into their own as serious shoppers work the halls and corridors, the fast food joints and the caverns of the car park. Here there is less respect for others' space, a greater wariness and sense of competition. This approach would, however, be useless in Bond Street or Knightsbridge. The British know that if they are not to be patronised or dismissed by up-market sales assistants, they must dress up, preferably in smart, fashionable clothes which excite the sales assistant's label-conscious envy. Here they cultivate a non-conciliatory manner, becoming demanding and capricious. Only when the assistant has succumbed and demonstrated the proper admiration and respect is any charm deployed. In between these extremes are subtleties: the knowledgeable country tweed look for antique shops and the dowdy-duchess in ancient Burberry, brogues and Hermes scarf for the Bond Street jewellers. When they're shopping, the Brits know what works.</p>

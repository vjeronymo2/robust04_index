			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Shadow of Indian unrest falls on Britain A fireman surveys the aftermath of a blaze that swept through the West Bromwich Shree Krishna Hindu Temple in the early hours of yesterday morning during a spate of attacks on Hindu centres in Birmingham, Bolton, Bradford, Coventry and Derby, Paul Cheeseright writes. An emergency meeting of Moslem leaders is being held in London today by the International Moslems Organisation. It is expected to appeal for calm after the attacks, which follow the destruction in India of an ancient Moslem mosque at Ayodhya. The organisation said: 'We don't want the violence to spread.' Yesterday in the areas where the attacks took place meetings were held by police and community groups that led to statements of inter-communal support. Police appeals for information about men seen close to the temples in West Bromwich and Coventry before and after the attacks indicated that little is known about the identity of the culprits. Police said two white men were seen near the Hindu temple in Harnell Lane, Coventry, around the time it was attacked, making premature any judgment that this incident was the result of tension between ethnic minorities. In the borough of Sandwell, of which West Bromwich is a part, the Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi communities make up more than 10 per cent of the population of 290,100. There are more than 9,600 Hindus and more than 7,700 Moslems. Damage to the Shree Krishna temple, which was attacked at about 3am, is estimated at millions of pounds. The fire was brought under control by 70 firemen before the interior of the temple was completely destroyed. A Hindu temple in Derby was severely damaged but attacks at the Vishwa temple in Bolton, the Hindu Cultural Centre in Bradford and temples in Sparkbrook, Birmingham, and in Coventry caused minimal damage.</p>

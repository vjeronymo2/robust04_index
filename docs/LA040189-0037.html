			<p><P> April 1, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'CULTURAL DIFFERENCES' AND FOOD  </P> <P> I agree the two Cambodian refugees should be persuaded to share our scruples.  After all, to paraphrase Mark Twain, we would only be adhering to that great  American principle that nothing needs reforming so much as other people's  habits.  </P> <P> The Cambodian methods are inefficient. They kill only one dog and have to do  the deed themselves. We Americans, on the other hand, have them killed by the  thousands in institutions where we can comfortably ignore their whimpers.  </P> <P> And killing for food? Really! Nothing so pedestrian as that here in America. We  kill our animals because they're a nuisance to us.  </P> <P> Those poor refugees have a lot to learn about our way of life. I hope that  after they've been here a few years they will understand. Maybe they can  explain it to me.  </P> <P> JON STREETER  </P> <P> Pasadena  </P></p>

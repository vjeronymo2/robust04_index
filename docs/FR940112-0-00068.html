			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Statutory Provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4003(a) of Public Law 101&hyph;508 amended the definition of ``operating costs of inpatient hospital services'' contained in section 1886(a)(4) of the Act to include the costs of certain services furnished prior to admission. These preadmission services are to be included in the Part A payment for the subsequent inpatient stay. For purposes of this interim final rule with comment period, we will refer to the provision as the ``3-Day Payment Window.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As amended, section 1886(a)(4) of the Act defines the operating costs of inpatient hospital services to include certain preadmission services furnished by the hospital (or by an entity that is wholly owned or operated by the hospital) to the patient up to 3 days prior to the date of the patient's admission. The inpatient operating costs definition contained in section 1886(a)(4) of the Act applies to both PPS and non-PPS hospitals. As an amendment to that definition, the 3-Day Payment Window provision applies to both types of hospitals as well. Further, this provision's placement in section 1886(a)(4) of the Act rather than in sections 1862(a)(14) or 1866(a)(1)(H) of the Act (each of which deals with rebundling_the practice of covering as hospital services those nonphysician services furnished to hospital patients by an outside supplier) indicates that the 3-Day Payment Window provision is separate and distinct from the rebundling requirement and, as such, may not be subject to the civil monetary penalties that apply to violations of the latter requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 4003(b) of Public Law 101&hyph;508 provides for implementation of the 3-Day Payment Window provision in the following three phases:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The first phase, effective from November 5, 1990 (the enactment date of Pub. L. 101&hyph;508) through September 30, 1991, includes any services furnished during the day before the date of admission regardless of whether the services are related to the admission. The Conference Report accompanying Public Law 101&hyph;508 indicates that this phase simply represents a statutory reiteration of the existing administrative policy. For this reason, the conferees did not expect that there was a need for any further administrative action by HCFA to implement this phase (H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 964, 101st Cong., 2d Sess. 701 (1990)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The second phase, effective January 1, 1991, involves diagnostic services (including clinical diagnostic laboratory tests) that are furnished during the 3 days immediately preceding the date of admission.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The third phase, effective October 1, 1991, includes other services related to the admission that are furnished during the 3 days immediately preceding the date of admission.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to adjustments to the DRG relative weights, the Conference Report states that, ``[n]othing in this provision requires the Secretary to take special action to adjust the DRG relative weights to reflect the additional services that would be covered by the DRG payment under this provision. The conferees expect that no adjustment will be made before [fiscal year] FY 1993 when Part a [A] billing data that would include the additional services would become available to recalibrate the relative weights.'' (H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 964, 101st Cong., 2d Sess. 701 (1990).)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 4003(c) of Public Law 101&hyph;508 specifically authorizes the Secretary to implement the 3-Day Payment Window provision through the issuance of interim final regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Provisions of the Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In this interim final rule with comment period, we are amending the Medicare regulations by adding new material to incorporate the provisions of section 4003(a) of Public Law 101&hyph;508 that amend section 1886(a)(4) of the Act and to apply the effective dates to these provisions as required under section 4003(b) of Public Law 101&hyph;508.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As indicated in section II of this preamble, the 3-Day Payment Window provision will be implemented in three phases. Phase one is intended simply to serve as a statutory reiteration of our existing policy as indicated by both section 4003(b)(1) of Public Law 101&hyph;508 and the Conference Report (H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 964, 101st Cong., 2d Sess. 701 (1990)). Phase two, effective January 1, 1991, specifies that payment for inpatient hospital operating costs includes diagnostic services that are furnished during the 3 days immediately preceding the date of admission. Phase three specifies that payment for inpatient hospital operating costs includes other (that is, non-diagnostic) services that are related to the admission and are furnished during the 3 days immediately preceding the date of admission. Under phase three of the new law, we needed to choose between two possible approaches to the treatment of non-diagnostic services furnished within 3 days before admission. (Phase two deals only with diagnostic services and, thus, is not relevant to this issue). Phase one of the 3-Day Payment Window provision and our existing policy for services furnished on the day before admission are both somewhat broader than phase three, in that they bundle all preadmission services into the inpatient payment, regardless of whether they are related to the admission. Thus, for the phase one period, we believe it is appropriate to follow the broader administrative policy, which is already in place. However, for the implementation of phase three (section 4003(b)(3) of Pub. L. 101&hyph;508) beginning October 1, 1991, we considered whether to apply this broader policy or impose a policy that follows the narrower wording of the new law, that is, include non-diagnostic preadmission services only to the extent that they are related to the admission.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

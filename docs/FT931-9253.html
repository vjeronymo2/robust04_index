			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / Bank ponders ways to lighten funding burden: Bond stripping IT is no secret that the Bank of England has a tough job ahead of it, with an estimated Pounds 50bn of gilt issues to carry out during the next financial year. It is no surprise then that the Bank is sounding out the gilt market for ideas as to how it might lighten the funding burden - including the development of a gilt strip market along the lines seen in the US, and to a lesser extent in some European markets. The development of a gilt strip market, involving the separation of a gilt into its coupon and principal repayment, would help to extend demand for the bonds, leading to an increase in prices and to a reduction in the cost of servicing the national debt, according to bond market analysts. The process of bond stripping is common in the US. Outside the US, the practice of stripping bonds is not particularly widespread. The French government has encouraged stripping of French bond issues, and with effect from this week, the Dutch will start the process of stripping the recently-issued 30-year bond. When the Dutch issued a new 30-year bond at the end of last year, several banks and brokers approached the agent of the Ministry of Finance asking for permission to strip the bond, claiming that insurance companies would be interested in buying the principal, while individual investors might want to buy the coupon stream. One London-based dealer in Dutch bonds says the move is likely to enhance demand for the bonds: 'For the big insurance companies, the principal provides a good match for their liabilities, and it is tax-efficient not getting the coupon stream -  it means you can tailor-make bonds from existing issues.' The agent has agreed to give licences permitting brokers to strip a specified amount of stock. There is about Fl 4.5bn of the 7.5 per cent bond due 2023 available, although the agent has said that it will continue to issue the stock during 1993. Mr Hank Bevers, agent of the Ministry of Finance, says that permission will be given for about half of the issue to be stripped, if there is sufficient demand. By awarding licences, he says it should be possible to ensure that liquidity in the bonds is maintained. News that the 30-year bonds would be stripped certainly helped lift the price of the issue. If the Dutch experience is a success, will the Bank of England feel more comfortable about introducing a gilt strip market here ? The Bank says that gilt-stripping 'does actually happen in a rather small, tailor-made way'. Some gilt-edged market makers point out that they have been able to ask the Bank for permission to strip gilts 'on an individual customised basis', although they add that it takes place rarely. Most of the investors who want to strip gilts are non-resident: for tax reasons, it simply is not attractive for the UK investor. For while the investor would normally hope to buy the principal and benefit from a capital gain, bond analysts point out that this part of the stripped bond would be taxed as a deep-discounted security. The 1989 budget saw the introduction of rules which were intended to 'ensure that discounts and premiums which take the place of interest are properly taxed as income'. One big US bond house says it would 'love to strip bonds, but it's just not realistic under the current tax regime'. An analyst at one of the big four gilt-edged market makers points out that if the tax situation could be resolved, the development of a proper gilt strip market would probably be welcomed by a lot of investors. 'Customers such as pension funds, which have relatively well-known, long-term, fixed liabilities want effective zero coupon bonds (ie, the principal) where they can create the duration that they want. And there would be demand for the coupons from insurance companies producing annuities,' he says. Mr Tim Lund, analyst at CS First Boston, believes the problems could be overcome: 'The development of a gilt strip market is desirable, but must be carefully thought through. We conclude that: UK taxation of zeros must be remodelled on US practice; stripped coupons should be paid only on a quarterly sequence of dates; and a fee, based on the market price spread between strips and bonds, should be charged or refunded as appropriate for stripping and recompositions.'</p>

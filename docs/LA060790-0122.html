			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FORMER GI GETS LIFE IN PRISON FOR SPYING;  </P> <P> WEST GERMANY: THE RETIRED U.S. ARMY SERGEANT WAS CONVICTED OF PASSING SECRET  NATO PLANS TO THE SOVIET BLOC.  </P> <P> In a case described as one of the most serious instances of treason in the  post-World War II era, a West German court Wednesday sentenced a retired U.S.  Army sergeant to life in prison for passing top-secret NATO battle plans to the  Soviet Bloc.  </P> <P> Clyde Lee Conrad, 42, from Sebring, Ohio, was convicted of passing wartime  deployment plans to East Bloc agents in such detail that Western defenses in  Germany would have collapsed before they could even form, according to Justice  Ferdinand Schuth of the Koblenz high court, which heard the case.  </P> <P> Schuth said the information passed by Conrad to the Hungarian and Czechoslovak  secret services "endangered the entire defense capability of the West." In the  event of a Warsaw Pact attack, it could have forced North Atlantic Treaty  Organization commanders almost immediately either to abandon the defense of  West Germany or order the use of nuclear arms.  </P> <P> "There has been no case of treason even remotely comparable in its  seriousness," chief West German federal prosecutor Kurt Rebmann said during a  summing-up last week.  </P> <P> Conrad is believed to have been paid more than $1.2 million for the material,  although no money has been found. In pronouncing sentence, Schuth described him  as "ice cold and unscrupulous".  </P> <P> The judgment followed a 24-day trial, in which the court reviewed over 5,000  pages of evidence.  </P> <P> The former sergeant first class, white-haired and dressed in a dark sports coat  and tie, was led away by police after the verdict. His lawyers said they will  appeal.  </P> <P> The seriousness of the security breaches caused by Conrad, who had a top-secret  clearance and access to the most sensitive of NATO material in his job as an  archive clerk at the U.S. Army's 8th Infantry Division headquarters in Bad  Kreuznach, 50 miles southwest of Frankfurt, recalled an earlier spy scandal  involving a U.S. Navy enlisted man, John Walker.  </P> <P> Walker, a communications specialist, passed Moscow secret codes used by Navy  vessels, enabling the Soviets to eavesdrop on highly sensitive Navy  communications.  </P> <P> Conrad, a Vietnam veteran described by those who knew him as friendly and  modest in his manner, reportedly had 13 years in the service and a clean  military record at the time he was granted his top secret clearance in 1978.  However, court documents indicated that he had already established contact with  Hungarian intelligence three years earlier.  </P> <P> The contact was made through Conrad's superior at the time, former U.S. Army  Sergeant 1st Class Zoltan Szabo, who himself was convicted last year of spying  by an Austrian court. Szabo cooperated with the prosecution by providing  evidence against Conrad.  </P> <P> Trial documents indicated that Conrad spied purely for financial gain, selling  alliance documents relating to nuclear and conventional battle plans to East  Bloc agents between 1975 and 1985, when he retired with an honorable discharge.  In those 10 years, Conrad passed information pinpointing the locations of NATO  unit deployments in time of crisis, their supply and ammunition dumps and the  lines of communications.  </P> <P> He was arrested in August, 1988, in the West German city of Kaiserslautern,  near Bad Kreuznach, where he lived with his German-born wife and 15-year-old  son.  </P> <P> His two Hungarian contacts, Imre and Sandor Kercsik, were arrested  simultaneously in Gothenburg, Sweden, where they worked as physicians. The  Kercsiks, who are brothers, either hand-carried the material back to Hungary or  delivered it to the Hungarian Embassy in Stockholm.  </P> <P> Conrad also passed documents to Czechoslovak agents, for which he was sentenced  separately to a four-year prison term.  </P></p>

			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / International Company News: BellSouth in multimedia trial plan for Atlanta BellSouth, the regional telephone company serving the southeastern US, yesterday announced plans for a trial of new interactive multimedia video services to 12,000 homes in metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia, starting next year. BellSouth has lagged several other large regional US telephone companies in setting up multimedia trials, but the plan it announced yesterday will have one novel element: it will combine existing analog cable television services with more advanced digital video services over a shared network. The use of analog technology means that customers in the trial area can choose to subscribe to the cable television service being offered by BellSouth, rather than their existing cable operator, without having to acquire the new set-top box required to receive the new interactive digital services on offer. Customers will be able to choose between a 60-channel cable television service and possibly more than 300 digital channels offering services such as games and movies. 'We believe our proposal represents the fastest, most economical and fairest way to make these services a reality,' said Mr William Reddersen, a senior BellSouth executive. Telephone companies like BellSouth are currently forbidden by law from providing cable programming within their own local service region. The company therefore plans to lease the cable channels it is setting up to Vanguard Cable, a subsidiary of a Texas-based cable company called Prime II Management. BellSouth is in the process of acquiring a stake in another Prime subsidiary. BellSouth has selected Hewlett-Packard, the computer and instrumentation group, to provide interactive video servers for the field trial. In January, Pacific Telesis, the California phone company, announced that it had selected HP's servers for commercial deployment in four California markets.</p>

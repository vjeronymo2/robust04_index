			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / Arts: LA at the Proms At a mere 75 years old, the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra may not have the venerable status of the Vienna Philharmonic or the Dresden Staatskapelle, but in its relatively short life it can boast a noble line of distinguished music directors, including Klemperer, Van Beinum and Giulini. Moreover, what it lacks in longevity it more than makes up for in the enthusiasm and expertise with which it delivers up a broad repertoire, including an enviably healthy proportion of contemporary music. The technical prowess of the individual players, their unanimity of purpose and the vivid immediacy of their playing are second to none, and were palpably evident during the orchestra's two visits to the Proms last Tuesday and Thursday. Much of the credit must go to Finland's musical wunderkind, Esa-Pekka Salonen, who was appointed the orchestra's musical director in 1992. An outstanding musician, a gifted composer as well as a dynamic conductor, one can sense the guiding hands of someone who knows music from the inside. The choice of a work tailor made for them to begin Tuesday's concert, Lutoslawski's Fourth Symphony, was particularly appropriate - and also poignant. Lutoslawski, who died last February, himself conducted the British premiere of this symphony at last year's Proms (it had been premiered in Los Angeles the February before). The beauty of its many lyrical passages is self-evident and its powerful climaxes are viscerally exciting; but certain stiffness characterises its more aggressive material, and the sudden upbeat ending seems a gratuitous afterthought. Nonetheless, Lutoslawski's fusion of an uncompromisingly contemporary musical language with genuine accessibility remains one of the most consistent triumphs of post-war music. Salonen's involvement with the nuts and bolts of composition is clearly a potent factor, too, in his attitude to the standard repertoire. His firm command of overall structure imprints his interpretations with beguiling logic as well as authority, traits amply demonstrated in a fluent, poised reading, of Mozart's D-Minor Piano Concerto, K466, with Emanuel Ax an eloquent and stylish soloist, and a taut, often ecstatic account of Hindemith's unjustly neglected though sometimes ponderous Symphony Mathis der Mahler. Inevitably, the greatest tests for an orchestra and conductor lie in the major symphonic repertoire. There have certainly been more expansive and searching readings of Bruckner's Third Symphony. Salonen's relaxed account, somewhat lacking in the customary Teutonic gravitas and spiritual fervour was, nonetheless, projected with blazing certainty, as was an immaculately turned Sibelius Second Symphony. In both cases there was scope for more subtlety and more expressiveness, though perhaps that may be too much to expect from an orchestra whose new home, scheduled for completion in 1997, is to be called The Walt Disney Concert Hall.

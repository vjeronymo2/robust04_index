			<p><P> April 10, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ROSENBACH WILL BYPASS REGULAR DRAFT  </P> <P> Timm Rosenbach of Washington State, the nation's leading passer last season,  will pass up the NFL's regular draft to take his chances on a supplemental  draft in early summer.  </P> <P> Rosenbach's agent, Gary Wichard, said today that he made the decision so that  the fourth-year junior would be treated -- and paid -- like a No. 1 draft  choice "rather than a guy taken sixth or seventh, depending on how things  fall."  </P> <P> Today is the deadline for players who still have eligibility remaining to  declare themselves for the April 23 draft. If they do not, they are  automatically excluded.  </P> <P> Rosenbach, who completed 67% of his passes and threw for 2,791 yards with 24  touchdowns and just 10 interceptions in 1988, is one of two prime junior  quarterbacks who have decided to turn pro this year. The other, Miami's Steve  Walsh, also is expected to bypass the regular draft.  </P> <P> For Rosenbach, the beauty of the supplemental is clearly in the money -- with  UCLA quarterback Troy Aikman sure to be the No. 1 pick, Rosenbach's value might  be diminished by the NFL's "slotting" system of salaries in which salaries go  down with each pick.  </P></p>

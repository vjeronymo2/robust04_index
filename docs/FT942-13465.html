			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: No sacrifices on altar of free trade Sir, Having returned to Europe after a period working in Japan, I feel it is my duty to combat the Euro-masochism that is no doubt heir to past British self-bashing, as expressed in Martin Wolf's recent feature ('A fortress would be no defence', April 15). It is easy to select certain statistics showing higher European wage costs per hour and public spending, and conclude that our tendency to regulate certain market excesses is harmful. However, if you look at other parts of the jigsaw, this fallacy becomes apparent. True, public spending and direct taxes in France are higher than in Japan. But the Japanese have to offset their lack of a social safety net with a huge savings rate, and no-one familiar with Japan would pretend that the Japanese standard of living is superior to that of their French (or British) counterparts. True, employment growth in the US over the past decades has outstripped that of Europe. But as Robert Reich, US labour secretary, himself points out, average non-farm private-sector real earnings have fallen more than 10 per cent in the last 20 years in the US. During the same period French and British real wage gains were well into double figures, and European productivity as a whole grew at an average annual rate more than twice that of the US's. This also corresponds to a dramatic fall in US manufacturing jobs and the decimation of whole industries once and for all (rather like Britain in the early 1980s). Perhaps US labour is competitive, but could Mr Wolf list what proportion of goods he owns or buys are made in the US? Free-trade is all very well as long as the playing field is level, which it is not. Why should we sacrifice our labour force on this altar when Asian workers are willing to toil under conditions analogous to 19th century Europe? Why should we give back a century's advance in average living standards (including its social element) by throwing the door open to those who will ruthlessly undercut us on price and social benefits, while resisting penetration of their own markets in industries where they are not yet up to speed? The closing years of this century are, as always, about economic survival. Asian countries have neither doubts nor qualms on that score. The US is, somewhat late in the day, waking up to the facts. Europe should learn the lesson and protect its interests. Otherwise, the recent signs of social unrest in France will seem like a tea-party compared with what is to come, Europe-wide.

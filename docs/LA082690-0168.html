			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TAKING SIDES ON INITIATIVES  </P> <P> To those Huntington Beach citizens who couldn't, or chose not to, attend the  three-ring circus on Aug. 10 in the council chambers concerning the Save Our  Parks initiative and a companion alternative, you missed a show.  </P> <P> The Save Our Parks proponents became so obsessed with their zeal to beat down  any opposition, they became paranoid.  </P> <P> The unjustified abuse that four of our more moderate council members were  exposed to was insulting, demeaning and a reflection on the mentality and  motivations of this spurious minority group.  </P> <P> As a representative member of the non-vocal, including the senior, sector of  Huntington Beach, if we let this loose-cannon Save Our Parks group prevail, it  would be a disaster and set Huntington Beach back 50 years for the benefit of a  small equestrian group.  </P> <P> J.R. OSTERLIND  </P> <P> Huntington Beach  </P></p>

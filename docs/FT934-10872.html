			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / International Company News: Time-out called as strains start to show - Delay to Renault-Volvo merger reveals differences in emphasis LIKE embarrassed mechanics rushing to fix a new model that stalls in the showroom, executives from Volvo and Renault were quick to insist yesterday that their ambitious plan to form a Franco-Swedish automotive powerhouse was suffering from no more than a temporary hitch. Both groups explained in soothing tones that Volvo's decision on Monday to postpone a shareholder vote on the proposed merger of its car and truck operations with state-owned Renault was simply a move to allow them more time to answer the concerns voiced by Volvo's highly sceptical Swedish shareholders. But despite the attempt at reassurance, there was little disguising that the postponement had revealed the strains involved in converting their three-year old alliance into a full-blown merger and carried no guarantee that Volvo will win a Yes vote from its owners at the re-scheduled meeting on December 7. A difference in emphasis was discernable between the French and Swedish sides yesterday. Renault and the French government stressed that clarification of the existing agreement, not renegotiation, was the order of the day. Volvo, however, did not rule out seeking at least some changes in the merger deal after it had ascertained more clearly what its shareholders  - mostly institutional investors - objected to. Working out what the Swedish shareholders are demanding is a more difficult task than it might at first sight appear. The opposition to the deal has focused on the timing of the privatisation of Renault - set to take place after the merger takes effect at the beginning of next year - and the French government's intentions concerning the use of a golden share which it will retain after privatisation. A director of one leading shareholder fund said yesterday that these questions had a vital impact on any analysis of the worth of the merger deal for Volvo, which is set to have a 35 per cent share in the new Renault-Volvo company. 'Renault is basically making a bid for Volvo's cars and trucks and paying with its shares,' he said. 'As Volvo shareholders, we cannot assess what those Renault shares are worth until Renault has a market value.' He said the French government's plan to retain a golden share not only contained a future threat to the level of Volvo's holding in the merged company. It also amounted to a 'poison pill' which would entail a discount in the share price of the merged company and thus also had an impact on the worth of the deal to Volvo. This shareholder would likely be satisfied by more information on the values imputed in the deal by Renault and Volvo and more details - hitherto not circulated by Volvo - of a mostly favourable 'fairness opinion' commissioned from Credit Suisse First Boston. However, some Swedish opposition goes well beyond this. It ranges from demands that the merger be postponed until after Renault's privatisation, to longstanding hostility to Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, the Volvo chairman, and his perceived sell-out to foreigners of Sweden's industrial crown jewels. 'Certainly there is a degree to which the privatisation and golden share issues are being used as a smokescreen for more basic opposition,' said a Stockholm investment broker. The French government and Renault believe that the failure to persuade Volvo's shareholders has been a problem of presentation rather than the terms of the agreement. Mr Gerard Longuet, the industry minister, promises that the merged group will be privatised as quickly as possible after the merger and that this should be achieved by the end of next year. The problem, however, is that such statements fall short of demands from Swedish shareholders for a fixed timetable. The French government says that because a successful privatisation depends on the conditions in the financial and car markets it is unwise to set a more precise date. 'Do you think shareholders would appreciate it if we went through with a privatisation which flopped?' asked one economic official. One solution would be to move the merger up the list of 21 publicly owned groups slated for privatisation, or even to launch the privatisation at the time of the merger - scheduled for January 3 next year. The problem with this approach, say French officials, is that it is necessary to establish a value for the merged company before it can be sold. It would also be politically difficult to bow to Swedish pressure on the timing of the sale of one of France's flagship public sector industrial groups. As for the golden share in Renault, the French government will retain the right to limit any investor to 20 per cent of the merged company's capital in the event of a breakdown of the shareholders' agreement. The government says that the golden share would only be used to protect the group from a hostile takeover. Nevertheless, it enables the French government to ensure French control of the group following privatisation - including, in theory, forcing Volvo's share down to 20 per cent. Hence Swedish objections. Persuading Swedish shareholders over the next month to support the merger seems certain therefore to require more than a stronger sell of the existing deal. At some point Volvo will turn to Paris for at least some degree of renegotiation, or new concessions. The importance of the deal for the French government and its privatisation plans may ensure the door is open. But yesterday was much too early to predict whether the new Renault-Volvo model restarts and makes it out of the showroom.</p>

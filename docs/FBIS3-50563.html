			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Luciano Suassuna and Daniel Stycer with the </F> "cooperation" of Raymundo Costa from Brasilia, Otavio Lage and  Sonia Neri from Belo Horizonte, and Francisco Alves Filho from  Rio de Janeiro]    [Text] On 9 December, President Itamar Franco left Brasilia  in a bout of rebelliousness. During his time in Rio de Janeiro  and Juiz de Fora, Franco demonstrated his mercurial temperament  by assailing journalists, cancelling speeches, bypassing  official security procedures, and commenting to his friends that  he wants to quit the presidency and settle down in Minas Gerais.  Unlike former President Jose Sarney [1985-90], Franco does not  like the ritual of the presidency -- the set of formalities with  which the president must necessarily comply. He made a point of  displaying this over the past 10 days. As one of Franco's aides  noted: "He likes to be treated like an ordinary citizen."    How can a president behave like an ordinary citizen or  overlook the damage this may cause the country at an especially  delicate moment? During the same week that Franco insisted on  behaving like an ordinary citizen, the Chamber of Deputies and  the Federal Supreme Court removed those guilty of corruption  from office. The Legislative and Judicial Branches thus  recovered part of the credibility they had lost. The  president's trip to Rio de Janeiro and Juiz de Fora was seen in  Brasilia as a lack of interest in power. "The Executive Branch  must exhibit an element of peace in the institutions," said Luis  Eduardo Magalhaes (BA) [Bahia], the PFL [Liberal Front Party]  leader in the Chamber of Deputies. Franco was holed up meanwhile  at the Gloria Hotel in Rio de Janeiro avoiding his main official  duty at this juncture, namely to negotiate the passing of  Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso's economic package in  Congress. He did discharge some less important duties, such as  installing two new ministers -- Social Security Minister Sergio  Cutolo and Culture Minister Luiz Nascimento Silva. These  appointments do not seem to have been preceded by substantial  politico-partisan negotiations. He also met Deputy Roberto  Freire (PPS-PE) [People's Socialist Party-Pernambuco], who  resigned as government leader in the Chamber of Deputies because  he disagreed with the economic plan. Free from the rigid  structure of rules and protocol at Planalto Palace, the  president ate pizza in the early hours in Rio de Janeiro and  played piano during the evening in Juiz de Fora. Thus began one  of the most astonishing weeks in his 15 months at the head of  the presidency.    Franco arrived in Rio de Janeiro on 9 December. The  following day he participated in a ceremony at the War College.  Before sunset he left the Gloria Hotel on his first rebellious  foray of the week. Accompanied by Minister Mauro Durante,  secretary general of the Presidency, and his nephew Ariosto  Franco, the president took to the road. After a nearly two-hour  drive he arrived at his apartment on Rio Branco Avenue in  downtown Juiz de Fora. By virtue of his post, these trips must  be made by plane, the presidential plane, or by car -- an  official car in a motorcade. The government delegation,  meanwhile, remained at the Gloria Hotel.    The absence of an armed escort for the head of state was  instrumental in causing the first major incident of his weekend.  Franco left his apartment of Juiz de Fora at 1600 local time on  12 December to visit his former mother-in-law, Zila, some 10 km  from downtown Juiz de Fora. Realizing he was being followed by  the press, Franco ordered the driver of his Monza car to go  faster. The driver ran a red light. Arriving at his  destination, Franco kicked the car door open. He lunged at  reporters, snatching the camera parasol of Rede Bandeirantes  Television and grabbing the flash from an O GLOBO photographer.  "Have you no respect for others?" growled the head of state.  "Please clear off, this is private property," he added.    This was Franco's second incident with the press in Juiz de  Fora. On All Souls' Day, he charged at a Rede Globo Television  cameraman filming Franco's visit to the tomb of his mother,  Italia Cauterio Franco. According to Ceara Governor Ciro Gomes  (PSDB) [Brazilian Social Democracy Party]: "This behavior shows  he is a tortured man," adding: "There is no excuse for this  behavior." Politicians have always been aware of the  president's oscillating behavior. But he has never exhibited it  with such force as he did over the last few days, thus  increasing the number of those who fear a disruption in the  democratic system of government and those who fear Franco will  resign. During an improvised news conference, Franco told  journalists: "If we manage to weather these three coming months  (until the end of March, by which time presidential candidacies  will have been defined) in democracy, respecting the  Constitution, and if I manage to hand over power to my  successor, I will be satisfied with myself." The fact that the  president included democracy in his conditional sentence  strengthens the conviction of those who exemplify the idea of  sutlers.    According to a group of friends and politicians, the fear  the president may resign -- which could trigger an institutional  rupture -- is also based on other indications. A friend of the  president from Brasilia said: "I talk with him every day and he  always says he is tired and going home." Franco talked about  this issue the week before he went to Rio de Janeiro. His  friend from Brasilia made the following interpretation: "It  does not necessarily mean resignation but these are the real  feelings of a man tired of power who lacks a private life." His  resignation is, however, possible. In his political career,  Franco resigned only once, when he left the presidency of a CPI  [Congressional Investigating Committee] on nuclear energy under  the Geisel administration. Every other time he held public  office, with the exception of one of the two times he was  prefect of Juiz de Fora, he talked about resigning every time he  faced a crisis. During the electoral campaign, he threatened to  leave Collor's electoral ticket three times. During the  presidency he talked about it when he completed one year in  office. In an interview, he admitted he was thinking of  resigning. Doubting that it was possible, leading politicians  checked the Constitution to find the legal alternatives to a  presidential resignation. Deputy Nelson Jobim (PMDB-RS)  [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party--Rio Grande do Sul] was  asked by military advisers about this possibility. The  Constitution establishes that Congress must indirectly choose a  name to complete the Collor/Franco presidential term. In the  Chamber of Deputies, some deputies already have their  candidates, among them, Senator Jarbas Passarinho (PPR-PA)  [Progressive Renewal Party--Parana Sate].    This is not the first time -- and will not be the last --  that the president has shown his lack of patience with the job  and his inability to move the pieces of the political game at a  time when Congress is weak. Two months ago when deputies and  senators installed the budget CPI, Franco told them he would not  oppose an agreement to hold early elections. The governor of  Ceara, surprised by the president's remarks, returned early from  Washington -- where he signed agreements with the Inter-American  Development Bank -- to meet Franco. The governor suggested that  Franco should fill the political vacuum created by the  accusations against congressmen. "Better not," said Franco, "it  may seem opportunistic."    For a group of the president's direct advisers, his apathy  has become an undeniable element. For example, the week the  budget scandal emerged, Franco prepared a 12-page speech that  was to have been delivered on radio and television network for  18 minutes. One individual involved in this project said: "It  was a speech to fill the institutional vacuum." The president  would have said: "The people have ethical values," unlike some  deputies and senators involved in the accusations. Franco also  was to have talked about education and other projects. One  adviser said: "He cancelled the speech because he was afraid of  touching members of the government." Two of his ministers were  on the list to be investigated. Following this first  cancellation, the president cancelled two other speeches.    In a week characterized by Franco's outspoken behavior, the  government also revealed its lack of political course because of  what the president did not say. In Rio, for example, Franco  canceled his participation in the ceremony to award swords to  the Naval School marines on 20 December. It was officially said  that the president's presence would not be necessary. The truth  is that Franco did not attend because he had prepared a dramatic  speech calling for a moderation of radical political positions.  Franco feared that his speech during a military ceremony would  be interpreted as something coordinated with the position  expressed by the Army chief of staff the week before. Franco  was unaware beforehand of the speech by General Benedito Leonel,  who referred to political issues.    His absence at the military ceremony seems to have  contributed to calming things down after the crisis that emerged  the week before. By issuing only a simple declaration supporting  the finance minister since the economic plan was announced two  weeks ago, the president cooperated with the criticisms made of  the economic team. Under pressure from the lack of political  support from Planalto Palace, Finance Minister Fernando Henrique  Cardoso already is thinking of carrying out the stages of the  plan ahead of time. For example, he could introduce the URV  [Real Value Unit] on 1 January, 30 days before the initial date.  Economist Edmar Bracha, the minister's special adviser, told a  friend in confidence that he has become the main target of  criticisms of the plan, and that he may leave the government  next month.    According to the presidential advisers, the president's  desire to resign reportedly came from a double disappointment in  addition to complaints from his family. In the political field,  he reportedly is disappointed with several people he knows whose  names are being investigated by the budget CPI. In the economic  field, Franco reportedly realized that nothing else remains for  him to do except support Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso's  economic plan. "Fire him to do what?" asked Franco during a  recent conversation with a congressman. He admitted: "I don't  have much time." For example, Franco disagrees with the  dollarization proposed by the minister and does not want to  suggest breaking up oil and telecommunications monopolies in a  constitutional reform. Therefore, he had to swallow the two  measures.    "I am personally against breaking up those monopolies, but I  will not oppose the measure if Fernando Henrique Cardoso  proposes it," Franco told journalists accompanying him to Brasao  restaurant in Juiz de Fora, where he had dinner at 0100 on  Friday after his speech at the Viana College graduation ceremony  at his daughter Georgiana's graduation from law school. The  family complaints come from the president's two daughters:  Fabiana and Georgiana. During his conversation with journalists  at the Brasao restaurant, the president was asked to request  Faviana's opinion, as an economist, about her father's  government. "Her comments are unpublishable," Franco said. "This  is why I have a sociologist instead of an economist at the  Finance Ministry." Both daughters demand more attention. They  have been to Brasilia only twice since their father took power.  On one of those occasions the president complained about not  being advised of his daughter's visit in time and because he was  afraid his private life would be exposed.    The most curious episode revealing Itamar Franco's  rebellious  attitude took place on Tuesday night. According to Attorney Jose  De Castro, president of Telerj [Rio de Janeiro Telephone  Company], Franco told his security guards at bedtime that he  would not leave the Gloria Hotel. The protection plan was  deactivated and only one guard stayed in the 10th-floor  corridor. At around 0100, Itamar Franco told the security  officer he would go to Mauro Durante's room. But it was a lie.  The president went to the lobby, where he met Castro. The couple  walked past two cameramen sleeping in the entrance and went out.  Franco jumped into Jose de Castro's car and drove toward the  pizza parlor in Botafogo. Franco ordered a tomato and cheese  pizza and drank two beers. Castro ate a tomato, cheese, and ham  pizza and drank four beers. They were not bothered, not even by  the couple kissing each other at one of the tables. "There was  no one around us. I believe the youngsters doubted the president  could have escaped from his hotel to eat pizza," Jose de Castro  said amusedly. "We left the pizza parlor at 0230 and returned to  the Gloria Hotel," Castro added.    Less than 48 hours later the president repeated the scene at  a Juiz de Fora restaurant. Twice after participating in his  daughter's graduation ceremony Franco walked to the piano where  professor Maria Tereza Laidersnaider, from the Music  Conservatory, was playing classical and romantic music, cheering  up the night at the Brasao Restaurant. At the end Franco played  together with the professor. He is convinced of the success of  changing habits and might repeat the experience in the coming  weeks. "Many people complained that he stayed in Brasilia too  much," Jose De Castro said. "Now he has gone to Rio de Janeiro  and he will return." The Gloria Hotel presidential suite has 500  square meters, five rooms, a dining room, a sitting room, a bar,  and a support kitchen. The walls are decorated with French silk,  the sheets are of special linen, and towels are hand  embroidered. The official cost is 50,600 cruzeiros a day.  Besides increasing his visits to Rio de Janeiro, Franco's  friends intend to work out a visit abroad. The official purpose  would be unimportant because the real purpose would be to give  Franco some 20 days of rest.    Whenever he has to have a tete-a-tete with somebody,  President Franco sits down on the person's right and stretches  his neck up a little. This is an old habit of his that goes  back to the time when he ran for governor of Minas Gerais in  1986. He told his friends then that he could not hear very  well. During the election campaign in 1989, he began wearing a  tiny hearing aid, strategically hidden under locks of hair, to  be able to face the election marathon. The hearing aid  disappeared after delicate microsurgery in Rio de Janeiro at the  beginning of 1990. "His hearing is normal and is being checked  by audiometric tests," states the president's physician at  Planalto Palace, Carlos Alberto Farias.    Besides this hearing deficiency, which has been totally  overcome now, the president's health does not have major  problems other than the ones common among 62-year-old people who  have an exacting work schedule and high stress levels. The  control of cholesterol levels, which is also common among people  his age, obliges the president to follow a spartan diet. Franco  takes vitamins A, B, and C, besides capsules of a vitamin  complex recommended for people his age, in order to prevent  possible stress crises. When he was a senator, Franco had  hepatitis-A, which left him with a liver condition.    The overtaxing situations the president has to confront by  virtue of the post he holds do not affect him clinically. But  they clearly disturb him emotionally, as noticed by some of his  friends from Juiz de Fora and Brasilia. One of them says: "In  private, he has never been different from the way he is at  Planalto Palace." "Itamar has always been very insecure and  prone to outbursts of anger. Sometimes he argued with me on  account of the most insignificant thing and the next day he  behaved as if nothing had happened," says Lisle Lucena, with the  authority of somebody who had a love affair with the president  for four years. Franco is a veritable romantic in his dealings  with women. He cannot restrain his jealousy, he writes poems,  and sends roses on special events. Lucena comments that Franco  did not want to become "emotionally involved" with his  girlfriends.    "That was the case with me; with Eleonora, Senator Jarbas  Passarinho's daughter; and even with his former wife, Anna  Elisa, who asked for a divorce because Franco did not share  anything with her," Lucena said.    His usual comment: "I wish I could change everything for a  net and a straw cigar," repeatedly mentioned by the president as  the subject of jokes by many, including some of his old friends.  "He is of Casa Jose Silva's type. Take three and pay for two,"  jokes a Juiz de Fora legislator. At parties, he hates to be  called president and when someone makes the mistakes of calling  him that he begs: "Please, call me Itamar."    Franco gives Palacio da Alvorada employees the same  provincial treatment and rejects the most human temptations. He  detests shrimp, lobster, and codfish. He loves Minas Gerais  cheese and never rejects a Campari -- his only alcoholic  concession besides the traditional draft beer in Juiz de Fora's  bars. He is a real frustration to gourmets because of these  gastronomic restrictions. His private cook, Helio Antion Alves,  is lauded only when he cooks chicken with okra or bug bear  Minas' style. "He only likes the usual steak with rice, beans,  and cold sweet potatoes," complains Alves. Every morning the  cook and housekeeper Raimunda Teles prepare the indispensable  presidential vitamin composed of papaya and orange.    The habit of leaving at the most inappropriate moments is  explained by Franco in a simple way. "I am like a bird who does  not sing when he changes. I need privacy and isolation," he told  a friend after scaring off the photographers in front of his  former mother-in-law's home in Juiz de Fora on 12 December. "The  day we started dating he was surprised when I asked him about  his car. He went to pick me up on foot and we ended up going out  in my Volkswagen," Lisle commented. When his former girlfriend  did not want to drive and the couple could not go out, Franco  would say: "Then we can sit on the sidewalk and talk."</p>

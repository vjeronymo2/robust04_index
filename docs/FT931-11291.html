			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Low EC growth threat to Emu: Warning from Brussels over risk to economic union plans LOW GROWTH in 1993 and 1994 threatens the EC's plans for economic and monetary union, Mr Henning Christophersen, EC economics commissioner, said yesterday. 'The big risk is that there is no growth. If there is nothing to improve the growth rate, there could be some doubts about the (economic convergence) criteria for some countries,' the Danish commissioner told reporters. He was commenting on the European Commission's annual economic report for 1993, published yesterday, which forecasts growth of 1.8 per cent in the Community next year, following 0.8 per cent this year. Britain has suffered the longest economic downturn in the post-war era, the report says. However, the UK economy is showing 'hopeful signs' of a recovery, with growth forecast at around 1.5 per cent this year and 2.6 per cent in 1994. The Commission also predicts that unemployment in the Community will rise to 11 per cent this year, and 11.5 per cent in 1994 - meaning that about 18m people in the EC could be out of work next year. Mr Christophersen conceded that the poor growth outlook raised questions about whether member states could meet the tough criteria on economic convergence outlined in the Maastricht treaty as a precondition for economic and monetary union. He repeated calls for Germany to cut its interest rates to stimulate a recovery. The Commission has generally avoided statements which could be viewed as challenging Emu's credibility. While Mr Christophersen said he was confident that a majority of states would be ready to sign up to Emu in 1997, he acknowledged there was a 'strong link' between EC efforts to promote growth and the implementation of the Maastricht's convergence programmes. The Commission's annual report, which was approved at yesterday's weekly meeting of the Commission, shows that only four countries - Denmark, France, Ireland and Luxembourg - met Maastricht's budget deficit criteria last year. The EC deficit average increased from 4.6 per cent of GDP in 1991 to 5.3 per cent in 1992. The UK public finances showed a marked deterioration, with the deficit shooting up from 2.8 per cent of GDP in 1991 to 6.2 per cent in 1992 and a likely 8.3 per cent and 8.2 per cent in 1993 and 1994 respectively. Differences between member states' inflation records narrowed by about 0.7 per cent to 4.6 per cent, but these were less favourable than in the US and Japan. Recent devaluations inside the European exchange rate mechanism threaten to revive inflation among member states, the report says. At the Commission meeting yesterday, several commissioners were reported to have expressed concern about continuing instability inside the ERM, and 'social dumping' - whereby workers' rights are downgraded to attract international investment. Mr Karel van Miert, EC commissioner for competition policy, said a balance had to be struck between liberal economic policies and social policy. His remarks reflected frustration over the UK's opt-out on Maastricht's social protocol. Mr Christophersen warned about the risks of 'renationalisation of macroeconomic policy' undermining Emu - a coded attack on the UK's decision to float sterling. Samuel Brittan, Page 18</p>

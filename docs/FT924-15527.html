			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Maxwell to continue SFO fight MR KEVIN MAXWELL is to continue his High Court challenge to have a judicial review of the rights of the Serious Fraud Office not to disclose documents to defendants before they are interviewed under its special section two powers. A High Court judge yesterday refused Mr Maxwell leave for such a review. However, his solicitors said afterwards that he would renew his application next week in front of two other judges. Mr Maxwell, who faces eight charges of theft and conspiracy to defraud, claimed that the SFO was failing in its obligations as a prosecutor and acting unfairly by not allowing him to see documents before he was interviewed under section two, which removes his right to remain silent. Mr Maxwell was due to have his eighth section two interview next Monday. That has now been postponed pending the result of next week's hearing.</p>

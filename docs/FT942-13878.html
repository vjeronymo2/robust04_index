			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / UK Company News: Plysu warns of halved profits Shares in Plysu fell 9p to 220p yesterday after the plastic container manufacturer warned that profits for the year ended March 31 would halve from Pounds 10.8m to about Pounds 5.4m, after charging reorganisation costs of Pounds 1.4m this time. Plysu said that in the light of recessionary conditions affecting its continental markets, it was making further significant reductions to its cost base, mainly in continental Europe. The dividend however, is expected to be maintained at 7p.</p>

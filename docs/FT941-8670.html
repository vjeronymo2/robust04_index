			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Observer: Wicked Britain's education secretary, John Patten, thinks kids are not sufficiently godfearing. Perhaps he should be directing his campaign at Japan - or specifically at a Japanese couple who tried to register their baby son with the name Akuma, which means 'devil'. The justice ministry was unhappy with this moniker and, after a seven-month tussle, Shigeharu Sato, the hitherto stubborn father, has given in. He is following his wife's suggestion. She has plumped for Jin, which means 'God'.</p>

			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Letter: Equal rank Sir, The word culture means many things to many people and therefore even in France not everyone might agree with Colin Amery that London is outclassed by Paris 'as an architectural and cultural city' ('A test for taste and political judgment', February 24). In Les Villes Europeennes, Mr Roger Brunet, the distinguished French geographer, uses a variety of indicators that exclude architecture and ranks London and Paris equal in 'la fonction culturelle'. Has Mr Amery become ensnared in the fashionable cult of London bashing? Terence Bendixson, 9a Gunter Grove, London SW1</p>

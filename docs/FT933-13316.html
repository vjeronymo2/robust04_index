			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / Neighbours with broken fences: The increasingly fractious relations between Russia and the former Soviet republics As though they were acting in concert, all the former Soviet republics are again in a ferment. North, south and west, the now independent states circling Russia are at least fragile, and often convulsed by civil war. In the three Caucasian states of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia, conflict between the political leadership and rebel movements over the control of land has become increasingly bloody, with both sides dependent on victory for survival. In the Baltics, Estonia and Latvia are struggling to enforce a new definition of citizenship that would reverse the post-second world war flow of Russians into their tiny populations, or at least assimilate them rapidly. In Moldova, the old struggle over control of the Trans Dnestr area remains barely quiescent - and Russian troops remain in place. In Belarus, the head of parliament (and of state) was almost dismissed by his own deputy for not being sufficiently 'pro-Russian'. In Ukraine, the prime minister demands, unsuccessfully, the proclamation of an economic state of emergency as the war of words with Russia over control of the Crimean region and the Black Sea fleet based there flares again. This follows the declaration 10 days ago by Russia's parliament of sovereignty over Sevastopol, the Black Sea port. In central Asia, the fighting which has reduced Tajikistan to dependence on Russian troops for the preservation of the government threatens to spill over into Uzbekistan, where an oppressive order is maintained. Both Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan are peaceful, but the latter is desperately poor and both fear a widening gulf between the large Russian minorities and the native Kazakhs and Kyrgyz. These diverse crises share two common characteristics. First, in each of the 15 former Soviet republics a bitter conflict is taking place for control of the nation. Even the best politicians of these young republics (and many are opportunist and ruthless) grope in a fog of ignorance which under-trained and inert bureaucracies do nothing to dispel. In each state, there is a 'nationalist' wing which wants to ensure the least involvement in the Commonwealth of Independent States - the umbrella structure covering the former Soviet republics - and a 'pragmatic' party which seeks to maintain minimal neighbourly relations, especially with the biggest neighbour of all, Russia. The second factor is the relationship all the former republics have with Russia. Russia dominates, not simply because it is the main provider of energy to many and a market for all, but because it retains hegemony over all former Soviet land space. Russia has troops loyal to it in every republic except Azerbaijan; some 25m ethnic Russians are scattered 'abroad' and concentrated in areas such as eastern Ukraine and northern Kazakhstan; and Russia retains the control systems for nuclear weapons based in three other republics. The Caucasian struggles are the bloodiest. Both Azerbaijan and Georgia have been left with malign legacies. Within their borders are autonomous areas which wish to adhere to states other than the ones which enclose them. In Azerbaijan, Nagorno-Karabakh, peopled now almost wholly by Armenians, has declared its sovereignty. In Georgia, the region of Abkhazia in the north-east aspires to become a Russian province - though the Abkhazians make up less than 20 per cent of the population. In the Abkhazian capital of Sukhumi, on the Black Sea, the two sides are engaged in a conflict which is shattering what was once an elite resort. Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, the Georgian leader, remains in the city in an effort to stiffen what has been a feeble defence by the untrained Georgian forces. Along the eastern borders of Karabakh, in the Azeri frontier towns of Fizuli, Agdam and Ter-Ter, the Karabakhers press into the outlying villages. A recent trip to two frontier towns revealed an Azeri 'army' of scared teenagers and local townsmen with a few ex-Soviet officers in command. In Baku, the capital, a president democratically elected 12 months ago fled as a former Azeri commander in Karabakh, Mr Suret Guseinnov, threatened to march on the capital. Mr Guseinnov is now prime minister. In these societies, democracy is often a shell and the economy - with the partial exception of oil-rich Azerbaijan - ruined. Armenia shivered through last winter with minimum power and little heat, its industry all but halted. Georgia is likely to be the same this winter. Prosperous enough in Soviet times, they have been reduced to international beggary. The Balts do not face poverty; they face problems of national self-definition. In Estonia and Latvia, the main obstacle to building the nation is the presence of hundreds of thousands of Russians of uncertain allegiance. Russians account for more than 30 per cent of the population in Estonia and some 34 per cent in Latvia. These postwar Russian settlers now exist in a limbo. Once the masters of their universe, today they are disenfranchised. Estonia is the first flashpoint, with a war of words under way between it and Russia over a law on aliens. The law, passed two weeks ago by the parliament, gives non-ethnic Estonians a year to pass a language exam as a necessary - but not sufficient - condition of being granted citizenship. The Russian-dominated city of Narva in north-east Estonia voted by a big majority in a referendum at the weekend for autonomy. This was immediately declared unconstitutional by Estonia, but the struggle will continue. The status of Russians everywhere in the former Soviet Union is at the heart of the crisis. Will that status be one of a minority loyal to their new homelands - or a potential fifth column, which could be mobilised by a Russian government with expansionist designs? The Baltic governments, with memories of the slaughter of their people after the second world war by Soviets, tend to the latter view; the Ukrainians, with a history of peaceful co-existence, inter-marriage and co-operation with the Russians, hope the relationship will survive. Yet in Ukraine, too, there are flashpoints. In the Crimea, Russia's parliament now lays claim to Sevastopol and the Black Sea fleet; much of Russian public opinion thinks the whole of the Crimea should be returned. The Russians of eastern Ukraine now have conservative, Russian nationalist groups in their midst, apparently gaining support in a region suffering from the economic crisis. The Ukrainian government is split. Distrust of Russia spreads, especially when its parliament claims Ukrainian territory; and there are increasing calls for retaining the nuclear weapons based in Ukraine as a safeguard against Russia. Yet, paradoxically, the prime ministers of Ukraine, Russia and Belarus signed a declaration 10 days ago stating that they would agree an economic pact tying more closely their parlous economies. These febrile moves reflect, too, the power struggles within Russia itself. President Boris Yeltsin and his government hold a wavering line which continues to lurch. To be sure, the government is not fully in command of the army, and has left the generals with too much freedom, especially in the Caucasus, to intervene in the local maelstroms. The generals openly wish Russia to remain the dominant power in the region - Mr Yeltsin said as much in a speech earlier this year - and will tramp heavily on those who threaten the perceived interests of the ethnic Russians 'abroad'. The end of great empires is evidently a slow business. Whether the ending will be peaceful is unclear and will depend greatly on how far the economic crises can be managed and how much support the rich western countries continue to give. For now, the signs are not promising.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- THE STRUGGLE FOR STATEHOOD  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Ethnic Russians outside Russia                               Russians              As % of                              (million)     local population  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Ukraine                           11.4                   22* Kazakhstan                         6.4                   38* Uzbekistan                         1.7                    8 Belarus                            1.4                   13 Latvia                             1.0                   34* Kyrgyzstan                         1.0                   22 Moldova                            0.6                   13* Estonia                            0.5                   30* Turkmenistan                       0.4                   10 Tajikistan                         0.4                    8 Azerbaijan                         0.4                    6 Lithuania                          0.3                    9 Georgia                            0.3                    6 Armenia                            0.1                    2  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Problem areas  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- AREAS OF FIGHTING  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Abkhazia, northern Georgia Nagorno-Karabakh The border region of Tajikistan and Afghanistan  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- AREAS OF HEIGHTENED TENSION  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- North-east Estonia Riga, Latvia Trans Dnestr, eastern Moldova Crimea, Donbass area of eastern Ukraine  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

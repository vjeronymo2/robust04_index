			<p>BFN     [Text] There has been an unexpected appointment to the  government's ranks. Nikolay Travkin, leader of the Democratic  Party of Russia, State Duma deputy and head of administration in  Shakhovskoy rayon [Moscow oblast], has been appointed a member  of the Russian Government. The relevant decree, INTERFAX  reports, was signed by President Yeltsin. Travkin's range of  duties is not specified. Here is what Travkin himself had to  say when interviewed by our correspondent:    [Begin Travkin recording] A consideration ever since 1992  and  the start of the reforms has been how to communicate between the  grassroots level, where the reforms take hold, and the level  where they are planned, conceived and designed, and how to speed  up the possibility of making adjustments and having direct  contacts between the rayon and the government so that it is  possible to respond promptly. It is in this connection that I  have been made a member of the government, but it is as minister  without portfolio. [end recording]    Nikolay Travkin did not rule out the possibility that the  heads of administration of other rayons would also be brought  into the government. However, it is necessary here, Travkin  said, to consider what the government will gain by this.  Indeed, Shakhovskoy rayon has shown in practice its approach to  reforms, and only in similar cases can the heads of other  administrations count on receiving government portfolios,  Nikolay Travkin emphasized.</p>

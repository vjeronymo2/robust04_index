			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Good idea - but will there be anyone working? Sir, Mr A Lister's suggestion (Letters, October 8) that the millennium should be celebrated in the UK by the government removing every traffic cone from every road by 4.30pm on December 31 1999 is admirable. However, whoever heard of any government department or associated contractor working between December 24 and January 3? Indeed, it is only to be hoped, because of the debate concerning whether the millennium should be celebrated at the end of 1999 or 2000, that public services and industry don't decide to bridge the entire year 2000. Tom O'Leary, Apdo 203, San Pedro de Aleantara, 29670 Spain</p>

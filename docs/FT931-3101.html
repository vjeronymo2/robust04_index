			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / VAT drop hits public finances A SHARP DROP in receipts from value added tax contributed to a deterioration in public-sector finances last month. The public-sector borrowing requirement in February was Pounds 5.4bn, Pounds 1bn higher than the market expected. The figure took the PSBR for the first 11 months of this financial year to Pounds 27bn compared with Pounds 7.4bn in the same period last year. The large monthly shortfall compares with a modest borrowing requirement of Pounds 963m in February last year. The increase in the PSBR could be explained partly by lower VAT receipts than in the previous two months, when a new collecting system brought receipts previously paid in February forward to January. Central Statistical Office figures showed that VAT receipts last month were Pounds 2.9bn compared with Pounds 4.3bn last February. In January receipts amounted to Pounds 3.34bn, contributing about Pounds 1bn to January's Pounds 3.83bn government surplus. Excluding privatisation proceeds - mainly the final call on British Telecommunications stock - the PSBR last month was Pounds 5.8bn. High government cash outlays also contributed to February's large borrowing requirement. Although central government spending of Pounds 20bn was slightly less than in January, it was Pounds 2.7bn higher than in February last year. The statistical office said that in the first 11 months of this financial year total cash outlays were 13.5 per cent higher than in the previous year. Income tax receipts were also lower, underlining the continuing impact of the recession. The government collected Pounds 3.8bn in income tax last month compared with Pounds 4.25bn last February. Corporation tax of Pounds 329m was little changed from February last year. Social security contributions amounted to Pounds 2.87bn, unchanged on last year. The statistical office said Inland Revenue receipts for the first 11 months of the year were 4.5 per cent lower than in the same 11 months of 1991-92. Social security contributions were 3 per cent higher.</p>

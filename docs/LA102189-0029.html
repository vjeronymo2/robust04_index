			<p><P> October 21, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> EL TORO SCORES EARLY, OFTEN IN VICTORY OVER DANA HILLS  </P> <P> Quarterback Steve Stenstrom passed for 271 yards and two touchdowns in the  first half to lead El Toro High School to a 41-21 South Coast League victory  over Dana Hills Friday at Mission Viejo High School.  </P> <P> Stenstrom completed 11 of 15 passes in the first half, including a 57-yard  touchdown pass to Reggie Watkins with 54 seconds left to give El Toro (7-0,  2-0) a 28-0 halftime lead.  </P> <P> El Toro Coach Bob Johnson removed Stenstrom early in the third quarter after  the Chargers made it 34-0 lead on Jerome Oakman's 1-yard run. Stenstrom  finished with 13 completions in 18 attempts for 277 yards. He was intercepted  once.  </P> <P> "I've said all along (that) Steve's the best quarterback in Orange County, and  he shows it every week," Johnson said. "He gets better each game."  </P> <P> Dana Hills (5-2, 0-2) tried to slow El Toro's passing game by double-covering  receiver Rob Johnson, Stenstrom's favorite target. That strategy left Rowe with  single coverage, which he beat for five receptions totaling 107 yards.  </P> <P> "Kevin's a great receiver," Stenstrom said. "When teams double-team Rob, Kevin  makes me look good because he always gets open."  </P> <P> El Toro finished with 461 yards in total offense, including 101 rushing yards  in the second half.  </P> <P> Dana Hills quarterback Grant Taylor connected with Chris Morgan on a pair of  24-yard touchdown passes in the second half. Taylor, who had only 14 yards  passing at halftime, finished with 265 yards on 15-of-20 passing with one  interception.  </P></p>

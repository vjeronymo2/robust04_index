			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, April 20 (XINHUA) -- NATO today backed a  UN request for new air strikes against defiant Bosnian Serbs to  protect UN-designated "safe areas" like Gorazde, but UN  peacekeeper commander say it is too late, reports reaching here  said.    The NATO ambassadors in Brussel held a meeting to discuss  the  latest situation in embattled Bosnian town of Gorazde. They  endorsed the UN request for air strikes, but delayed a final  decision pending military advice on options for using air power.    The allies agreed "we have got to find a way to respond  positively" to the request, Britain's Ambassador, Sir John  Weston, said Wednesday.    However, UN Commander Lt. Gen. Sir Michael Rose said it is  too late for air strikes around Gorazde because Serb troops are  too close and bombing would most probably endanger the 50,000  civilians huddling in the war-ravaged town.    "There is nothing we can do to sustain the fences of  Gorazde," rose told reporters.    In Gorazde, UN aid workers strongly pleaded for their lives  as Serbs relentlessly shelled the hospital and other buildings  in the Muslim enclave.    Workers said in a message to UN offices in Geneva that three  rockets hit the hospital, killing at least 10 people and  wounding more than 15. They spoke of despair after a three-week  Serb offensive that has reportedly killed at least 367 people  and wounded more than 1,000.    A new cease-fire agreement was signed by Serb leaders and  the  UN late Tuesday, but it appeared to be only the latest in a  string of broken promises.    Serbs' political leader Radovan Karadzic today issued a  statement saying: "The Serbian side unilaterally proclaims  peace in Gorazde. With this, the Gorazde crisis comes to an end."    He made the statement in an apparent response to appeals for  a cease-fire by U.S. President Bill Clinton and Russian  President Boris Yeltsin.    NATO planes launched three rounds of air strikes in the past  three weeks after serb offensive on Gorazde, one of six  UN-declared "safe area" in Bosnia. Two air attacks only  infuriated the Serbs while a third attack was thwarted Saturday  when a British jet was shot down.    Bosnian Serbs began the war in April 1992 after a  Muslim-Croat vote to secede from Yugoslavia. The Serbian armed  forces have seized about 70 percent of Bosnia in fighting that  has killed or left missing more than 200,000 people.</p>

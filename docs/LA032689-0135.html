			<p><P> March 26, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HOSPITALS AND PROBLEMS OF CARING FOR INDIGENT  </P> <P> Your editorial "Government Must Pay for Care of Indigent" (March 19) is very  timely. State and county governments point fingers at one another in blame and  nothing gets done. Then they blame physicians and hospitals and again, nothing  is done.  </P> <P> We are all to blame in our own way. But the problem of financing gets worse,  especially as it relates to care for the indigent and uncompensated care. Just  ask county officials whether they would want to see a county hospital operated  by the county. Why should they? Physicians and hospitals are absorbing the  costs. And they face severe financial problems as a result.  </P> <P> UCI Medical Center is the very large tip of the iceberg in Orange County. As  its percentage of uncompensated-for and Medi-Cal patients increases, it loses  more money.  </P> <P> Hospitals and physicians are responsible parties, but we cannot continue to  carry this increasing burden while the County of Orange and state of California  ignore their own obligations.  </P> <P> I agree with The Times that we are all ultimately at risk, and I hope that  members of the public will contact their elected representatives .  </P> <P> CRAIG G. MYERS  </P> <P> Santa Ana  </P> <P> Craig G. Myers is executive director of Coastal Communities Hospital in Santa  Ana.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] As a longer range priority, Crimea must be an  independent legal entity and form a closer union with Russia,  leader of the local Republican Party Sergey [Serhiy] Tsekov told  parliament on Tuesday. He believes the idea of such a union  must be legislated upon.    On Tuesday, the parliament's largest Russia faction holding  55 out of the 98 seats overwhelmingly approved Tsekov's  candidacy for the speaker's post.    Tsekov himself prefers a safer option providing for  appropriate agreements to be signed with Ukraine and Russia and  whatever laws needed to be adopted.    His rival Vladimir Klychnikov has called for a balance of  forces in parliament and the society.    On the diplomatic front, priority must be given to Russia  given that the emerging situation is good for Crimea's movement  towards Moscow, he said. Klychnikov thinks Crimea must take  advantage of the current situation when unification trends  pervail both in the Russian and Ukrainian parliaments.    The deputies are expected to elect a new speaker later  today.</p>

			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Motoring: A Mercedes to remember - Stuart Marshall laments the loss of his 190D 2.5 - a car of top quality built for adult motorists HAVING owned and driven cars for more years than I care to remember, I reckoned I could look at any of them dispassionately. They are, when all is said and done, steel boxes on wheels. But parting with the Mercedes-Benz 190D 2.5, almost exactly 12,000 miles (19,320 kms) and one year after driving it brand-new to Frankfurt for the motor show last September, has been a wrench. I shall miss the three-pointed star at the end of the bonnet, more than I had thought possible. The 190D 2.5 that has served me faultlessly is that rare bird, an automatic diesel. Engine and transmission are matched beautifully. Driven with a light foot, it changes up silkily at under 2,000 rpm. The 190D 2.5 is not particularly high-geared; 81 mph (130 kmh) on an autoroute represents 3,500 rpm. But the 2.5-litre, five-cylinder engine is so quiet that passengers often have needed convincing it is a diesel. Between 70 mph (113 kmh) and 100 mph (161 kmh), the noise level hardly changes. More than once, when enjoying music on a motorway, I have been surprised to find the speedometer needle has edged into the naughty 90s. Automatic transmission is near-essential for the business motorist and air-conditioning - a boon during the sticky summer - a most desirable extra. But both absorb some power and do nothing for fuel economy. So, I rate the 35.94 mpg (7.86 l/100km) I have averaged over the year most satisfactory. During that time, the Mercedes has had plenty of very short trips and cold starts as well as long motorway hauls. The engine is naturally-aspirated. (While there are turbo-charged Mercedes diesels, you cannot buy them in Britain because a right-hand steering column would get in the way of the plumbing). Its 94-horsepower output is modest for 2.5 litres - it is only marginally more than that of the 1.9-litre turbo-diesel in the Citroen ZX, and its torque (pulling power) is substantially less. A two-pedal 190D 2.5 would not appeal to an impatient, forceful driver. In a traffic lights grand prix, it is no match for a company rep in a Cavalier L. Does this matter? Not to me. I learned long ago that dashing from one hold-up to another is always pointless, sometimes counter-productive. The extra weight of the five-cylinder diesel compared with a standard 190's four-cylinder petrol engine does nothing for its agility on a winding road. But the up-side is that the car runs straight on a blustery motorway, brushes rough roads aside and, even by Mercedes standards, feels unusually solid and enduring. A 190D 2.5 is for adult motorists - for people who admire top build quality, want doors to close with a soft thud, and expect a car to drive like new when it has at least 100,000 miles on the clock. Mercedes virtues are more easily perceived than described. It is a bit like trying to put into words the difference between cast-iron and plastic baths; leather riding boots and the cleverest moulded ones; wood-grained laminate and oak panelling. The real thing simply feels, looks and works better and grows old more gracefully - and none more so than the 500SE bought new by a Cambridgeshire company director, Michael Davidson, in 1984. This week, it is heading for 320,000 miles (515,000 kms) and is still running well. Apart from two new front springs, a fuel pump, water pump, battery and new sets of tyres every 35,000 miles (56,000 kms), all it has cost to run is petrol (20 mpg/14.1 l/100 km) and regular servicing. He says it has become the family pet. I know how he feels. Many times in the past year, I have stepped out of some snappy, trendy test car and found that settling on the 190D 2.5's firm seat behind its big steering wheel was like being reunited with an old friend. Of course, it is not a perfect car, just a very good one. Even with the driving seat set as low as possible, the non-adjustable steering wheel's rim partly obscures my view of some instruments. A convex off-side door mirror (like the nearside one) would reduce a blind spot that can be awkward when joining a motorway. Rear seat leg-room is adequate rather than generous although the boot is enormous - it easily takes two golf bags in their trolleys and a weekend's luggage. And the car's nose-heaviness makes the front tyres work hard when cornering. Their outer shoulders are beginning to show enough wear to make tyre rotation worthwhile at the 12,000 miles service now due. Apart from that - and a boot lid scraped slightly by someone's luggage trolley in the Gatwick airport short-term car park - the Mercedes looks and feels as if it had just left the showroom. First cost of a 190D 2.5 is high. It is listed at Pounds 20,346, which includes power steering, electric windows and central locking. But its key-in-hand price with automatic transmission, air-conditioning, power sun-roof, stereo radio/tape, alloy wheels and exterior thermometer is closer to Pounds 27,000. That is not the whole story, though. Few used cars are more sought-after or command better prices than a Mercedes. Given proper servicing it will last longer, depreciate more slowly and provide better long-term value (as well as better motoring) than almost any other car.</p>

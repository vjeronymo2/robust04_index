			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / International Company News: Ares-Serono ARES-SERONO, the Swiss-based pharmaceutical group and world leader in human fertility drugs, expects sales to fall this year to between Dollars 820m and Dollars 840m from Dollars 854.5m in 1992, due mainly to the dollar's strength. Operating income last year was Dollars 80m, writes Frances Williams in Geneva. Mr Fabio Bertarelli, chief executive and principal shareholder, said yesterday currency movements were obscuring gains in product sales and market share. In May, the group announced an 8.8 per cent drop in sales in the first quarter, compared with a year earlier, but in constant dollar terms turnover rose 3 per cent.</p>

			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Brussels given electronics task: Divided EC ministers commission probe into troubled sector EC INDUSTRY ministers yesterday papered over their main differences on remedies for European electronics by asking theCommission to organise an urgent high-level investigation of the troubled sector. Ministers agreed that Brussels should, after consulting companies and governments, produce concrete proposals 'as rapidly as possible' to target EC-funded research more effectively, as France has demanded. But they also undertook to maintain competition in the sector, as Britain urged, and not to favour bigEC companies to the detriment of smaller or non-EC ones, as Ireland and other countries on Europe's periphery feared. Yesterday's council debate clearlyreflected concerns by Britain and some smaller countries that, in the wake of asupposedly secret meeting in France 10 days ago, certain commissioners were cooking up a package of financial aid/trade protection for the big French, Dutch, German and Italian electronics companies. Thus, the Commission was asked yesterday to widen its dialogue with industry. Mr Roger Fauroux, industry minister of France, which is pushing most insistently for EC action to ward off the Japanese challenge, stressed that keeping Europe in the electronics race was vital for civil and military reasons. 'The electronic fireworks seen during the Gulf war would not have been possible had all the chips been in Japanese hands,' he said. Referring to current Brussels scrutiny of his plans to aid state-controlled Bull and Thomson, he said that it would be 'very odd if one were to claim EC support for companies, and deny governments the means to help companies'. Ministers agreed that plans such as that discussed by Europe's three big semi-conductor producers - SGS-Thomson, Siemens and Philips - to merge theirresearch were for the companies to decide. But if they did so decide, Mr Fauroux said, he did not expect the Commission 'would brandish the lightning bolts ofEC competition rules to thwart such a merger'. The pricing of Japanese electronics deserved thorough investigation for possible dumping, he minister said. Though seeing no case for higher regular import tariffs, France sided with the Netherlands in wanting to maintain the 14.9 per cent tariff on semi-conductors. Germany was prepared to see only a modest cut in that tariff and could not agree to Britain's stress on the interests of European chip users, rather than producers. This was a response to Lord Hesketh, junior UK industry minister,who sought to ridicule Commission and French plans for trans-European electronic networks to benefit computer-makers, saying 'few would regard road investmentas something to be manipulated to serve the concrete industry.' Mr Michael Smith, the Irish technology minister, made an even stronger interventionfor free trade and non-discrimination. It was a vital national interest for Ireland, whose largely US electronics sector produces a third of total national exports, that the Community should not penalise non-EC companies.</p>

			<p><P> March 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAGAZINES: HARPER'S OFFERS UP A RISKY SPOOF  </P> <P> In what may prove to be a much-publicized and controversial package, the April  issue of Harper's magazine asserts that Jesus would need a comprehensive,  well-coordinated publicity campaign to make the Second Coming a success in the  '80s.  </P> <P> In a series of cover stories meant to parody today's obsession with the media  blitz, the magazine asked a variety of experts to "offer Jesus frank advice on  six tasks critical to winning over American public opinion: developing a media  strategy, writing a monologue for a guest-host appearance on 'Saturday Night  Live,' redesigning the cover of the New Testament and writing the jacket-flap  copy, designing a contemporary wardrobe, and developing a storyboard for a  one-minute television commercial."  </P> <P> Senior editor Jack Hitt, who came up with the idea, said the articles try to  answer the question "How would Christ get sold?" if he were to reappear on  Earth as predicted in the Book of Revelation. The point, Hitt said, is to  satirize the widely accepted notion that politicians, rock stars, denture  creams and, yes, messiahs, all must employ "the same basic tools" to get their  message, song or product across in today's interlocking, interdependent system  of print and broadcast media.  </P> <P> However, Ron Suskind, a former political campaign aide in state and national  races who wrote the main story for the package, acknowledged that the point of  the exercise may be missed by those who fail to see any humor in a satire that  uses religion as a vehicle.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Braced for the Backlash  </P> <P> "I'm waiting with bated breath to see what kind of treatment puritanical Boston  gives it," said Suskind, now editor of Boston Business magazine. ". . . I guess  we're all waiting to see what the reaction's going to be because it could be  very interesting."  </P> <P> He added: "We are not poking fun at Jesus but rather at ourselves. We are doing  a parody of this huge packaging machine in this country. . . . We are trying  not to underrate our fellow man and if he doesn't get it, it probably means we  have overrated him." He conceded that some will see the issue as "probably  sacrilegious and mean-spirited."  </P> <P> In his memo outlining strategy for Jesus' tour of the United States, Suskind  advised: "For the first three days, we've planned several miracles of the  modest water-to-wine variety that should verify Your authenticity but stop  short of conjuring up the divisive flood-and-fire imagery of Armageddon. We  want to show a willingness to perform miracles while, at least in the  beginning, respecting the existing laws of physics. To encourage spontaneity,  Your itinerary will note various 'miracle opportunities' -- miracle ops."  </P> <P> Suskind also warns that Jesus should beware of the Washington press corps.  "Leader of the corps is a man named Sam Donaldson, sardonic and versed in human  sacrifices," he writes, referring to the ABC television newsman. "He is trained  to ask the question You most wish to avoid. He will try to test and embarrass  You, probably with one of those theological chestnuts. Our sources indicate he  will ask: 'If you are omnipotent, can You create a rock You cannot lift?' Think  about it."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Rags to Heavenly Riches'  </P> <P> The new jacket-flap copy for the New Testament, written by Norton book  publishing's Gerry Howard, reports that "At the age of 30 Jesus was an obscure  Jewish carpenter in a backwater province of the Roman Empire . . . today,  countless millions in every corner of the world call Him Savior. In an age  devoted to the creation and near-worship of celebrity, His name recognition  worldwide is uncontested." Describing the work of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John  as "four novellas," the jacket copy says that each book retells "the compelling  personal saga of Jesus, a breathtaking rags-to-heavenly riches story of  struggles and triumphs, of faith and betrayal, of suffering and death -- and  Eternal Life."  </P> <P> Editor Hitt said he had a tough time obtaining articles suitable for the point  he was trying to make. "I  </P> <P> had to kill a lot of pieces because a lot of people assumed it was a lampoon on  Christ," he explained.  </P> <P> So far, Hitt and Suskind said they've had little reaction and most of that has  been favorable. But both expect response -- possibly even fulminations -- from  unappreciative quarters starting this week. Subscribers began receiving their  copies of Harper's last week, but the issue is only now showing up on  newsstands, according to Hitt.  </P> <P> "My brother likes it but he said he wouldn't recommend anybody reprint it in  the South," said Hitt, a native of South Carolina.  </P> <P> Of the two, Suskind seems to expect the more dire reactions, both short term  and long term. For one thing, when he asked eight major political media  consultants to help with the project, all declined, even though they expressed  initial delight with the concept. In general, the consultants told him they  were worried that their participation would "fall into the hands of my  opponents in the next race and it would be used against my candidate," Suskind  recalled.  </P> <P> As for himself, Suskind figures he isn't going to be able to work in politics  again for a long time, if ever.  </P> <P> "I don't think there's any realm where there are more peculiar resurrections  than politics," he said. "I will never say never. But I have no plans to return  to politics."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Travelers' Checks  </P> <P> Los Angeles was voted one winner and one loser in Entree's second annual  Excellence Awards based on the votes of more than 4,000 readers of the Santa  Barbara-based newsletter for upscale travelers. The Hotel Bel-Air was selected  as the best hotel in the United States while another local institution, Spago,  was voted the "most overrated restaurant."  </P> <P> Billionaire Donald Trump's Plaza Hotel in New York was voted -- for the second  year -- the "most overrated hotel anywhere" as Entree readers overcame "a  brainwashing plethora of publicity and advertising from the glitzmeister Donald  Trump."  </P> <P> The newsletter's readers also zinged the Beverly Hills Hotel, "proving that  even if you are the Sultan of Brunei with a zillion dollars it doesn't mean you  can have a top hotel." The sultan purchased the landmark hotel in 1987.  </P> <P> A San Francisco restaurant, Masa's, was voted the best restaurant in the United  States, while Taillevent in Paris was voted the best foreign restaurant. London  got the nod for the best foreign hotel, the Connaught, while the Mauna Kea  resort on Hawaii's Big Island was voted the "best resort anywhere." Singapore  Airlines was voted the world's best airline.  </P> <P> The magazine also reported other dislikes with airlines, particularly American  carriers, getting the "most thrashing." Entree's readers disliked airline food,  shrinking seat space, "babies and parents being bumped into first-class, excess  hand luggage, lack of safety, chatty captains" and "lack of service." On the  ground they hated "over-friendly waiters, hotel phone systems, customs,  mini-bar checks, pretentiousness, smoking, and sloppy, informal service."  </P></p>

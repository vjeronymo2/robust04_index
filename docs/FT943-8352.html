			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / Labour MP backs Bolger New Zealand's National government has doubled its parliamentary majority to two after opposition Labour MP Peter Dunne responded to Prime Minister Jim Bolger's warnings of political instability by agreeing to vote with the government until its term of office ends in 1996, writes Terry Hall in Wellington. Next month, new electoral boundaries will be announced in preparation for a switch to proportional representation and a reduction in seats from 90 to 66 may weaken loyalties across the parties.</p>

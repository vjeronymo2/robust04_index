			<p><P> April 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRITAIN'S SECOND SATELLITE TV SERVICE WILL DEBUT;  </P> <P> COMMUNICATIONS: THE NEW OUTFIT IS TAKING ON A COMPANY OWNED BY RUPERT MURDOCH.  THE WINNING FIRM MAY BE THE ONE WILLING TO LOSE THE MOST MONEY.  </P> <P> At the stroke of 6 p.m. on Sunday, British Satellite Broadcasting will launch a  $2.1-billion television programming service that will give Britain five new  national channels, advance the state of TV technology by a couple of notches  and threaten competitor Rupert Murdoch's dream of a satellite television  empire.  </P> <P> Premiere night viewers will first see a program about the company's operations  called "Around BSB in 80 Minutes." Then its five themed channels -- all  transmitted from the company's own satellite -- will split off in separate  directions. Subscribers will have their choice of the Movie Channel, which will  debut with the James Bond film "The Living Daylights;" the Sports Channel;  Galaxy, a general entertainment channel; Now -- The Channel for Living, which  will provide information and arts programming, and Power Station, BSB's answer  to MTV.  </P> <P> The grandiose debut is marred only by the fact that fewer than 500 households  in Britain have the special reception kits needed to pick up BSB's satellite  transmission.  </P> <P> Even when coupled with the estimated 300,000 homes capable of receiving BSB  through cable television, the viewership remains at an extremely modest level  that makes the launch mostly symbolic.  </P> <P> It's not that no one is interested. More than 40,000 people paid a $16.50  deposit to join a "Launch Club" that would supposedly give them first crack at  BSB receiving equipment. They're still waiting.  </P> <P> The problem is that manufacturing setbacks have created such a severe shortage  of reception kits that there do not appear to be enough even to supply  demonstration models for all the country's retail showrooms.  </P> <P> "I've got one," quips John Gau, the company's optimistic chief programmer. But  he admits, "We certainly have a slight temporary glitch. We'll have a month of  glitches."  </P> <P> He believes that the equipment will become widely available by late May or  June. From that point, according to the company's internal financial forecasts,  BSB will have to pick up 3 million subscribers in three years to break even.  That means one of every seven of Britain's 21 million television households.  </P> <P> "Obviously, that's quite a tough call but not impossible," says Gau, a veteran  of the BBC.  </P> <P> A consortium of investors led by Granada TV, entertainment and media giant  Pearson, Reed International, the French communications group Chargeurs and Bond  Corp. of Australia are betting heavily that it will work, but the obstacles are  formidable.  </P> <P> Most noticeably blocking the path to riches for BSB is Murdoch's rival Sky  Television, which already beams four channels -- news, sports, general  entertainment and a subscription movie service -- across the country. Besides  persuading consumers that they should invest in satellite TV in general, BSB  must persuade them to choose its channels over Murdoch's.  </P> <P> That won't be easy. Sky, operating for more than a year, claims to reach  720,000 dishes in the UK and Ireland. "We feel we have an important lead over  them," says Fiona Waters, director of publicity for Sky.  </P> <P> The big lead is significant not only for the early momentum it has given Sky  but because of the incompatibility of the rival satellite transmissions. Each  system has its own receiving dish that cannot pick up the other's signals. With  a minimum outlay of several hundred dollars required to buy the cheapest dish,  overlapping is expected to be minimal.  </P> <P> The BSB equipment, which transmits on a technologically advanced D-Mac  standard, will provide better quality pictures and is likely to offer  additional features down the road because of its high power and ability to  address individual receivers.  </P> <P> And BSB also is quick to point out that its range of dishes -- the most  publicized being a flat, square device nicknamed the "Squarial" -- are smaller  and less obtrusive than the Sky dish. Reports of neighborhood squabbles over  the alleged unsightliness of the Sky dish are not unusual.  </P> <P> But Sky, which transmits on the European standard PAL, has its equipment priced  at least $150 less than BSB's -- just over $400 for a unit with remote control,  compared to an average $575 for BSB. It remains to be seen how many people will  pay extra for a marginally sharper picture.  </P> <P> Ultimately, the satellite battle of Britain will probably be decided by  programming. If there's something viewers want to watch, they'll get it.  </P> <P> BSB seems confident that it has the overall formula and the individual hit  shows. The company has gone to tremendous lengths to push the notion that it  alone will be the British satellite system, a sort of BBC from outer space. At  the same time, BSB has tried to portray Sky as an Australian-American invader  that befouls the airwaves with mindless game shows, professional wrestling and  car chase movies.  </P> <P> While Sky's entertainment programming does contain a healthy share of cheap  American reruns and has been soundly criticized by the press, its Sky News has  received high marks. In addition to offering its news channel and Sky One, the  general entertainment channel, Murdoch's enterprise also includes Eurosport,  which is beamed across Europe, and Sky Movies, a pay subscription service.  </P> <P> For its programming, BSB also has included some American retreads but appears  to be reaching for a certain level of sophistication. Among the U.S. shows set  to air are "Hill Street Blues," "St. Elsewhere" and "China Beach" -- along with  "The Young and the Restless."  </P> <P> But much of the programming will be new shows commissioned from British  production companies or reruns of British hits.  </P> <P> "They've bought a lot of the classic BBC shows," says Graham Wilde, an  executive at CIT Research in London, which studies the telecommunications  industry. "I think that's significant. People prefer to watch programs that are  based in their own countries."  </P> <P> The most intense fighting between BSB and Sky is expected to come over their  movie channels. Sky Movies and BSB's Movie Channel, which both charge about $15  monthly, will bring each company about 70% of its revenue for now, according to  CIT. Advertising income is expected to be minimal.  </P> <P> With Hollywood at the core of both movie channels, Sky has struck exclusive  British pay-TV deals with 20th Century Fox, which Murdoch owns, and Disney's  Touchstone. BSB has exclusive rights to 2,500 films from Paramount, Universal,  Columbia, MGM/UA, Orion and Warner Bros.  </P> <P> "I think they've both put together attractive movie packages," says CIT's  Wilde. With BSB finally debuting, the satellite contest may ultimately rest on  which company is willing -- or able -- to lose the most money for the longest  time. Sky officials said they are losing a whopping $3.3 million a week, but  Murdoch has stated publicly he will stay in the game for at least five years.  </P> <P> BSB's backers also are investing the kind of money that would suggest that they  will wait out rough times. BSB will spend $363 million on programming during  its first year of operation. Another $330 million will be spent over the next  three years on marketing and promotion aimed at grabbing those viewers who may  sign up eventually but need "an extra push" to do it right away.  </P> <P> While no one can predict whether one or both satellite services will survive,  one scenario is that both companies will find it too difficult to continue  after spending such vast amounts of money, says CIT's Wilde. "It's difficult to  see how they're ever going to recoup that money," he says.  </P> <P> Jeremy Mayhew, a media analyst with Booz, Allen &amp; Hamilton in London,  envisions another possible outcome that would hinge on cable television.  </P> <P> Although the British cable industry is in its infancy, it could see explosive  growth over the next few years. If that happens, Mayhew says, "there is room  for two significant program suppliers."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Sky and BSB will battle for the great rewards that could result from  their gamble. Says BSB spokeswoman Alison Jackson, describing the lure of such  a risky venture: "Once you get rich in this business, you get very rich, and  you stay rich for a long time."  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FESTIVAL '90;  </P> <P> A MATTER OF PRIDE;  </P> <P> CONTROVERSIAL MURALS OVERCOME CENSORSHIP TO DEPICT L.A. HISTORY AND CHICANO  PRIDE  </P> <P> Some murals that bedeck the scene as Los Angeles Festival opens are going to  give streetside L.A. not only a new look, but also a challenging one. Two of  them, for that matter, are not new. Although Willie Herron's faded "Doliente de  Hidalgo," completed in 1976, was rescued by the Social and Public Art Resource  Center (SPARC) as part of its 1989-1990 Neighborhood Pride: Great Walls  Unlimited Program, Barbara Carrasco's "History of Los Angeles -- A Mexican  Perspective," first undertaken in 1981, is being reclaimed after being  concealed from the public eye on other, and controversial grounds.  </P> <P> Considering the issues concerning censorship that have made headlines for more  than a year, and considering Los Angeles' own history on censorship, such  action is a switch.  </P> <P> Censorship here peaked during the McCarthy era when city fathers were bent on  finding hammers and sickles in the most benign abstract or semi-abstract  paintings. In the case of public art, officialdom remained vigilant even into  the '80s as the Carrasco work testifies, in order to decide for citizens what  was and what wasn't suitable view.  </P> <P> It had been hoped that along with the Carrasco work, whose completion and  installation is sponsored by the festival, that the restoration of David Alfaro  Siqueiros' "America Tropical," which had been under way, would be completed in  time for the festival. As The Times reported earlier this month, completion  will not take place until 1991. Painted on a second-story wall on Olvera Street  in 1932 and hidden under coats of whitewash since shortly afterwards, it was a  prime target of official decree.  </P> <P> "America Tropical" reflected Siquieros' outrage against the exploitation of  migrant workers in the United States, and their mass deportation to Mexico, but  the depiction of a crucified Mexican Indian placed below a predatory American  Eagle outraged civic leaders, promoting them to take immediate action.  </P> <P> After an earlier attempt to restore the mural was abandoned in the 1970s,  "America Tropical" has been undergoing conservation work on the wall of the  Olvera Street building where it was installed. The 16-by-80-foot artwork may  still be obscured by scaffolding when the festival opens but should become  visible shortly afterwards, according to program director Claire Peeps.  </P> <P> The whitewashing of the Siquieros work is recorded on the Carrasco mural, whose  completion was blocked less than a decade ago. Now, the Chicana artist's work,  which has precisely the same dimensions (16 x 80 feet) as the Siqueiros --  coincidence, Carrasco says -- will go on view at Union Station, to beam down  from a wall in the main waiting room, only a stone's throw from the Siqueiros.  </P> <P> Commissioned by the Community Redevelopment Agency following approval of the  artist's sketch in 1981, the mural was rejected by the CRA a year later on the  grounds of its subject matter, especially for scenes depicting Chinese railroad  workers who were executed in the late 19th Century and the internment of  Japanese-Americans during the World War II.  </P> <P> After a court battle over ownership of its copyright, which the artist  ultimately won, the controversy did not prevent exhibition of a large section  of the unfinished, but luckily, portable, work at MIT in 1987. Critical praise  ensued.  </P> <P> Carrasco's mural has 51 panels, each framed in strands of hair flowing from the  head of a dreamy Queen of the Angels at the far left. Reading chronologically  from left to right, they portray historical events, landmarks and figures that  are not just meaningful to Chicanos but point to the contribution of the many  cultures that have played a role in making Los Angeles the city it is today.  </P> <P> They range from the building of the San Gabriel Mission to a contemporary  freeway scene; from the depictions of an unidentified Gabrielino Indian and the  first black mayor of Los Angeles, to murdered Times reporter Ruben Salazar,  "Zoot Suit" playwright Luis Valdez and its star Edward James Olmos, and the  Dodgers' Fernando Valenzuela. Carrasco's 17 young assistants, most of them gang  members, along with others involved in the project, are there too.  </P> <P> Born in El Paso in 1955 and raised in the Mar Vista Gardens housing project,  Carrasco has won global recognition. A UCLA graduate and currently a Master of  Fine Arts candidate at CalArts, she collaborated on the "Zoot Suit Mural" at  the Aquarius Theatre in 1979, and on murals in Armenia and Nicaragua, and in  addition, has created banners and other artworks for the United Farm Workers.  Another controversial work, "Pesticides," was shown last year on a spectacolor  lightboard in New York's Times Square.  </P> <P> The fresh, vibrant hues that emblazoned Willie Herron's "Doliente de Hidalgo"  in East Los Angeles when it was first completed will again beam down from the  Mercado (then Farmacia) Hidalgo at 4301 City Terrace Drive.  </P> <P> Herron's mural, 15 x 150 feet, wraps around the building's facade like a shaped  canvas, facing south, southwest and west, centered with a large-scale depiction  of the crowned Virgin Mary, and Father Miguel Hidalgo holding a flaming torch  in his right hand, his left raised in defiant gesture, to recall the movement  he organized to protest Spanish rule.  </P> <P> The work also portrays indigenous Mexicans of the last century, a contemporary  family of three and futurist Latinos traveling through space.  </P> <P> According to the artist, the mural symbolically attempts to address the  increase in Latin American contributions to the present and future that is  shaping and redefining Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Herron, who has also participated in Chicano music and performance  organizations, has exhibited internationally, and, as one-half the design team  of Herron-Roberts, is a graphic artist for the Chicano Art Resistance and  Affirmation (CARA) exhibition at UCLA.  </P> <P> "Doliente de Hidalgo," for which Herron was assisted by Ralph and Rene Ramirez,  is one of 15 murals sponsored by SPARC's Neighborhood Pride: Great Walls  Unlimited program, bringing the total to date to 24.  </P> <P> Directed by muralist Judith Baca, and housed in the old Venice Police Station,  SPARC is a nonprofit, multicultural, community-based arts organization  dedicated to producing, exhibiting and preserving public murals of Los Angeles.  Now in its third year, the city's Great Wall program commissions artists and  pairs them with youths from the neighborhoods in which their murals will be  seen.  </P> <P> Bus tours of Neighborhood Pride: Great Walls Unlimited are set Saturday and  Sept. 16 (half-day), or you can view them as part of a rear-projection slide  presentation of a national selection of Chicano murals on a large-scale screen  during the exhibition, "Chicano Art: Resistance and Affirmation, 1965-1985," at  the Wight Art Gallery, UCLA, Sept. 9-Dec. 9  </P></p>

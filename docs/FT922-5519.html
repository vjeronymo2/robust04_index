			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / International Company News: Top Finnish bank slips deeper into the red KANSALLIS-Osake-Pankki (KOP), Finland's largest commercial bank, has reported a loss of FM526.6m (Dollars 118.9m) for the first quarter of the year. It follows a deficit of FM1.64bn for 1991 and compares with a FM94.8m loss for the first three months of last year. Mr Pertti Voutilainen, chief executive, said the bank was 'working hard' to improve its performance but 'no major change will be possible until economic growth gains momentum'. KOP's operating income went into the red in the first quarter, to FM180.4m, a 180 per cent fall from the FM224.2m profit in the same period of 1991. The bank wrote off FM728.2m on lending and guarantees in the first quarter of 1992, a 212 per cent increase on the FM233.6m write-off for the same period of last year. Equity per share fell by 18 per cent in the first quarter, to FM48.47 on 30 April, from FM59.07 for the same date last year. 'Despite the grim environment, KOP has managed to strengthen its capital structure,' said Mr Voutilainen. The group's capital ratio is now 8.8 per cent calculated in accordance with the regulations of the Basle-based Bank for International Settlements. Mr Voutilainen said KOP planned a 10 per cent cut in the bank's payroll, a shake-up of the management board, and an increasing focus on basic banking services through a reallocation of capital from real estate.</p>

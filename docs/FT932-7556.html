			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Tax limit on gifts IF I CHOOSE to give my son money as a gift, what is the annual limit that I can give without having any tax liability? He has a National Savings number. Could I, for example, make over a maturing certificate to his number without difficulty or penalty? You are able to make an annual gift of Pounds 3,000 out of your annual exemption for inheritance tax purposes. If you have not made a gift in the previous tax year to April 5 1993, then you can double the gift to Pounds 6,000 to take account of the past year's relief. In previous replies, I have also made reference to the possibility of providing gifts out of income; but it would appear that you wish to make a one-off gift which might not fall into this category. It would be possible for you to make the gift by transferring the proceeds from a maturing National Savings certificate to your son. But if you are still holding the certificate, you should check the extension rate as it might not be competitive and it could be better to transfer the money into a new certificate.

All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p><P> January 14, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FAMILY SPOTS: DINOSAURS STEAL THE SHOW AT WEEKEND KIDS' EVENTS  </P> <P> If there's one topic that lets preschoolers rise above their preliterate  limitations, it's dinosaurs. Today's youngsters can rattle off four- and  five-syllable tongue-twisting names and identify dozens of silhouettes without  skipping a beat. Anything with a dinosaur theme elicits squeals of recognition  and delight. Two family events this weekend zero in on youngsters' fascinations  with the prehistoric:  </P> <P> Wonderworld Puppets presents "The Jerry Dinosaur Show" at the Torrance  Community Theater, 1522 Cravens Ave., Torrance, at 10:30 a.m. today and Sunday.  Froggie, Wonderworld's ongoing puppet hero, finds a dinosaur egg in his  backyard, and that leads to a wishful trip back in time, during which he meets  a Spinasaurus, Apatosaurus and Tyrannosaurus Rex.  </P> <P> After the show, puppeteers Ric and Julee Morton take down the curtain and  demonstrate how the show was done, and kids are encouraged to come up to the  stage and hug the puppets. Tickets are $4 and reservations are suggested: (213)  532-1741.  </P> <P> At the Natural History Museum's Ralph M. Parsons Discovery Center today, 1:30  to 3 p.m., Louise Cooper will show how to make origami dinosaurs by folding  colored paper into fanciful shapes. Kids will take their projects home with  them. The workshop is free with museum admission: adults, $3; seniors 62 and  over and students with ID, $1.50; children 12 and under, 75 cents. No  reservations are taken but space is limited, so an early arrival is advised.  Families who arrive early can tour the museum's dinosaur exhibits for  inspiration before the workshop. Information: (213) 744-3534.  </P> <P> SPECIAL EVENTS  </P> <P> The Rebel Ropers, a troupe of youngsters who perform heart-stopping,  choreographed jump-rope routines, will demonstrate their split-second timing  and incredible energy today at the Westside Children's Museum at 1 p.m. After  the performance there will be three simultaneous jump-roping workshops. The  museum is at 1302 11th St., Santa Monica, on the former Madison School site.  Admission: adults, $5; children ages 5-12, $2; plus $5 for the workshops.  Information and reservations: (213) 451-5524.  </P> <P> At today's marionette workshop at noon at the La Habra Children's Museum, 301  S. Euclid St., La Habra, Grace and David Kreps will begin with a short  performance to show kids marionettes strutting their stuff, followed by an  explanation of how the puppets are made: carving the heads and bodies, painting  faces and stringing them so they almost seem lifelike. Admission: $1.50,  adults; $1 for children ages 3-16 (includes the workshop and the continuing  special exhibit, "Under the Big Top"). For reservations, call: (213) 905-9793.  </P> <P> To celebrate our newest holiday, participants in this weekend's Sunday Open  Sunday workshop will create masks to commemorate Martin Luther King's spiritual  and creative work. Families can work together and may take their projects home  at the end of the day. The free workshop begins at 2 p.m. at the Junior Arts  Center, 4800 Hollywood Blvd., Hollywood. No reservations are taken.  Information: (213) 485-4474.  </P> <P> OUTDOORS  </P> <P> The birds that make their winter home at Malibu Creek State Park will be the  focus of Sunday's early morning Sierra Club walk. Beginners, adults and  children are welcome. Bring binoculars and bird books if you have them, but  don't let that be the deciding factor: There are plenty of birds visible to the  naked eye, especially with expert birders on hand to point them out. Meet at  the parking lot at 8 a.m. Bring snacks and water. The park is located on Las  Virgenes Road, one-fourth mile south of Malibu Canyon Road in the Santa Monica  Mountains. Information: (818) 888-3770.  </P></p>

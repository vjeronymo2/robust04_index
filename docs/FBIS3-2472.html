A news  blackout has been imposed on the controversy over the law, which  was to have been approved by the Standing Committee of the  National People's Congress in April. "It is now doubtful  whether the law can be passed before 1995," a member of the  drafting team said. "This has turned into a deeply political  problem."    A draft handed over to the National People's Congress legal  work committee in January contained provisions which would allow  shares in state-owned firms to trade freely on stock exchanges.  Backed by securities authorities, the head of the drafting  team, Professor Li Yining of Beijing University, argued that  "state shares should be tradable, otherwise they are dead".    Some senior leaders, notably Chen Qingtai, a vice minister  of  the State Economic and Trade Commission in charge of reform of  state enterprises, said enterprise reforms should first be given  a chance to work before the door is opened for state firms to be  privatised. "It's a debate about when this approach should be  taken," the drafting team member said. "Some people feel the  central government should take measures to make sure this does  not happen too fast."    While the public ownership issue has been looming since  drafting work began last year, a new ideological conflict has  arisen on winners and losers in the country's volatile stock  markets which has further complicated passage of the proposed  securities law, the member said. Beijing is afraid that the  rapid worsening of fortunes among China's relatively well  educated and informed new stock investors may set off protests  as more cases of insider trading and corruption are revealed,  the member said. A survey by the State Commission for Economic  Reform at the end of last year found that 43.2 per cent of  China's shareholders lost money, while only 23.8 per cent made  money and 32.4 per cent broke even.    The poor overall returns were explained by the fact that  more  than half of China's 25 million-plus shareholders bought shares  for the first time in 1993, when profits from share trading  suddenly became thin. "They have realised that the upstart  millionaires are usually of low cultural quality, but are  well-connected, while the bulk of those who lose money are  well-educated," the member said. "The central government has  become more cautious since secondary markets have been less  profitable," the source said. "The situation is different from  (the riots) in Shenzhen in 1992, when workers and peasants  protested because of corruption. Now it's a question of  middle-class people losing money."    More than 58 per cent in the survey felt the operation of  markets was not fair, with 86 per cent identifying  administrative interference, incomplete laws or insider trading  as the biggest problem. Beijing intends to sit on the new  securities law for most of this year while asking the Shanghai  and Shenzhen markets to continue improving trading, listing and  disclosure systems, the source said.    Big cases of corruption will also be rooted out to "pacify  the worries of the shareholders". Beijing last week sentenced  to death Shen Taifu, chairman of the Great Wall Electrical  Machinery Company, which illegally raised more than a billion  renminbi [RMB] (HK$888m) [Hong Kong dollars] from investors last  year, of which Shen embezzled more than RMB4m and handed out  RMB250,000 in bribes.    Last month a brokerage affiliated to the Agricultural Bank  of  China was heavily fined for making RMB6.72m on insider trading.  "The government feels the need to stabilise the worries of the  majority of shareholders before allowing any more development of  the stock markets," the member said.</p>

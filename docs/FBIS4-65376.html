			<p>BFN     [Text] Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's  alternate special representative, met President Glavkos  Kliridhis this morning. The purpose of the 45-minute meeting  was to brief Kliridhis on the Vienna talks at which the United  Nations gave clarifications to the Turkish side.    Answering questions afterward, Feissel said he had prepared  his report to the secretary general but avoided saying whether  he had already submitted it. Asked if the report contains any  ambiguities, Feissel said he does not usually repeat himself. He  added, however, that the content of the report to be submitted  to the Security Council is up to the secretary general, just as  the decision is up to the Security Council.    Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis said after the meeting  that from the briefing it followed that there is no prospect for  a change in the Turkish stance and that the UN efforts for the  confidence-building measures have failed.</p>

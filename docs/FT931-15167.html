			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Peace wins an 11th-hour reprieve: A last-minute turnround by Bosnia's Serbs has brought hope to the Geneva talks The spectacular turnround by the Bosnian Serb leader, Mr Radovan Karadzic, at the Geneva peace talks on Bosnia has, for the first time in many months, brought a glimmer of hope that a solution to that bloody conflict is on the horizon. Yet in spite of the conditional agreement on a future constitutional framework for Bosnia that was reached on Tuesday, only the most incurable optimist could ignore the very big obstacles to a comprehensive peace settlement that still lie ahead. The very fact that it required the combined forces of three presidents - Mr Dobrica Cosic of the rump federation of Yugoslavia, Mr Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia and Mr Momir Bulatovic of Montenegro - to change Mr Karadzic's mind on the international mediators' proposals showed how difficult he found that decision. Even then, Mr Karadzic considered it necessary to shift the responsibility for his acceptance of the plan, tabled early this month by Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, to the Bosnian Serbian assembly, which has either to approve or reject it within seven days. In spite of Mr Karadzic's optimism that it will do so - the Bosnian Serb leader's forecasts have frequently proved to be inaccurate in the past - there is absolutely no guarantee. It was, after all, the Bosnian Serb parliament which rejected the Vance-Owen plan in the first place and gave Mr Karadzic a mandate for intransigence at the Geneva talks which, until his last-minute turnabout, he respected to the letter. The best hope that the Bosnian Serb assembly will, in the last resort, swallow the constitutional principles, already formally endorsed by the Bosnian Croats and, in principle, by the Moslems, again lies in the pressure that can be exerted by Mr Milosevic and Mr Cosic, particularly the former. Mr Milosevic was invited to the last round of the Geneva talks by the two co-chairmen, in spite of his bad international reputation, in the hope that he could repeat his peace-making performance of January last year. On that occasion, he brokered a ceasefire agreement between Serbs and Croats, which opened the way to the presence of the United Nations Protection Force in disputed areas. It was a considerable achievement which has since been obscured by the continued fighting and slaughter which has cost some 17,000 lives in Bosnia. Notwithstanding scepticism about Mr Milosevic's fundamental desire to act as a mediator, he came up with the goods, albeit after the plenary negotiations had already broken down. In subsequent bilateral meetings with Mr Karadzic, Mr Milosevic and Mr Cosic are reported to have made it clear that they considered a peace settlement to be in the interests of Serbia, whose rapidly deteriorating economic situation could only be improved by a lifting of international sanctions. The Serbian president is also understood to have stressed that, if the Bosnian Serbs dug in their heels and became involved in a military conflict with western nations, they could not necessarily count on Belgrade's support. The implicit threat that Belgrade might cut the Bosnian Serbs' life-line by withdrawing military and economic support is Mr Milosevic's most powerful card, if he is prepared to play it. The fact that both Mr Milosevic and Mr Cosic have expressed their intention to defend their views personally before the Bosnian Serb assembly is a further indication that they are serious in their support for the mediation effort. Mr Karadzic's last-minute change of heart was announced not by himself, but in a communique issued by Mr Cosic's spokesman, which made clear that his decision had been made on 'the insistence' of the three presidents. This eloquently underlines the nature of the pressure that was exerted. It is the first time that any kind of rift has appeared in the greater Serbian camp and that must be considered good news for the peace process in the former Yugoslavia. Mr Karadzic, of course, has tried to make the best of a bad job by stressing that the co-chairmen's 'revised' proposals have fully taken into account his demands, repeatedly proclaimed throughout the negotiations since they started two weeks ago. Specifically, he claimed that the proposed division of Bosnia-Hercegovina into 10 semi-autonomous provinces would be tantamount to creating a system under which there would be 'many states within a state', thus giving the Bosnian Serbs virtual independence in both domestic and foreign affairs. That is precisely what Mr Vance and Lord Owen have studiously avoided in their constitutional plan for an independent and sovereign Bosnia-Hercegovina, whose territorial integrity will be guaranteed. Though their proposals make clear that the provinces of the new decentralised state will be largely self-governing for internal affairs, they emphasise that the provinces 'shall not have any international legal personality and may not enter into agreements with foreign states or international organisations'. In other words, the Serbian provinces will not be able to decide separately on their links with Serbia, let alone on secession from Bosnia-Hercegovina to join a greater Serbia. Such a constitutional provision would have been rejected outright by the Bosnian Moslems and is also unacceptable to the international community as a whole. The only minor concession that the co-chairmen made to Mr Karadzic's views was to condense two of the articles of their original 10-point constitutional framework. They amalgamated article 4, which states that the new constitution will recognise three 'constituent peoples', with article 1, specifying that Bosnia-Hercegovina shall be a decentralised state made up of largely self-governing provinces. This modification has given the concept of constituent peoples (Serbs, Moslems and Croats) greater prominence by moving it up to the top of the text of the constitution, but the substance of the document has not been altered. Mr Karadzic has signally failed in his bid to gain recognition for 'the three major ethnic groups as the constituent units of state', a formula which, in the eyes of the co-chairmen and Bosnian Moslems, would have opened the door to the eventual creation of an independent Bosnian Serb state. Mr Vance and Mr Owen have repeatedly made it clear to Mr Karadzic that the provision for semi-autonomous provinces in their proposals offer the Bosnian Serbs all the guarantees they need to preserve their identity. Yet even if the Bosnian Serb assembly endorses the new constitutional framework, that would leave some substantial hurdles still to be negotiated on the road to a comprehensive peace settlement. The mediators' package contains two other important elements: an agreement on the actual boundaries of the new provinces and an agreement on the cessation of hostilities and the pull-back of troops. It is widely recognised that the first of these will be extremely difficult to negotiate, given both the Serbs' demand for a corridor across the north of Bosnia which would link up the territories assigned to them, and Moslem demands for various adjustments to the proposed boundaries and a greater share of the total area of the new state. By contrast, there is already a wide measure of agreement on the military aspects of a peace settlement, with even Mr Karadzic, it is said, prepared to accept that the future Bosnia-Hercegovina should be demilitarised and Sarajevo declared an 'open city'. Be that as it may, the Bosnian Serb leader has already made it clear that he is opposed to the proposal under which all heavy weapons of the combatants would be placed under UN control or supervision. Mr Vance and Lord Owen have already shown that they are up to the task of overcoming even these complicated remaining problems. This week, when they were playing for very high stakes, the co-chairmen proved themselves to be poker players of the highest calibre. What they will find very difficult to do, however, is to deliver an agreement which will be fully implemented by all the parties. Too often, Bosnian peace hopes have been dashed. It is the durability of the Vance-Owen plan that will be its ultimate test.</p>

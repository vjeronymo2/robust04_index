			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Survey of Spain - Banking, Finance and Investment (10): A flush of Euro-funds / Spain is attracting large amounts of capital investment from the EU A visitor who ventures out of the urban environments of a Madrid or a Barcelona and takes to the Spanish byways will soon come head on with the circular constellation on a blue background that denotes European Union-inspired bounty. Anybody that is considering financial projects in Spain should first take aboard the fact that the country is a prime target for massive capital investment funds that, routed from Brussels, fall on the Spanish plain like manna from the sky. There is a growing business among those who match available funds with borrowers and there is also increasing expertise among those potential private sector investors who track the route blazed by Brussels' Ecus. At the begining of this month the European commission approved structural funds worth Ecu26.3bn for Spain between 1995 and 1999. This sum represented more than half the total structural funds approved for all the other 11 European Union members and it was more than double the funding that Spain's regions received between 1989 and 1993. Given such Brussels largesse it is not surprising that Spain should also be the largest borrower from the Luxembourg-based European Investment Bank (EIB). Last year EIB loans to Spain totalled Ecu4bn, a figure that was 44 per cent up on Spain's 1992 borrowing and which represented 22.6 per cent of the Ecu17.7bn loans made by the Luxembourg institution to all of the EU members. Sir Brian Unwin, EIB's chairman, claimed that the financing facilities routed by the bank to Spain in 1993 represented the biggest ever loan total made available to an individual EU member in a single year. The flush of Euro-funds into Spain is held up with pride by the Madrid government as a prize won by the negotiating skills of prime minister Felipe Gonzalez in successive European summits and as a tribute to the Spanish contingent's ability to drive a hard bargain in Brussels. There are some intelligent complaints being made about the Ecu flow, notably those that are voiced by economics Professor Pedro Schwartz of Madrid University, an acerbic deregulation lobbyist and member of that rare breed, the Spanish Eurosceptic. Mr Schwartz likens the onset of funds to Faust's pact with Mephistopheles and argues that the sudden arrival of a lot of structural funds to improve Spain's infrastructure will not necessarily make Spain less poor. A visitor to Spain cannot help noticing that while the Euro-financed highway schemes might have ensured quick journeys between the provincial capitals, they have also succeeded in by-passing largish towns between the departure and destination points. Service industries in such towns used to earn a great deal of income from their proximity to the former national roads that the new beltways have replaced. The less acceptable face of the EU's lavish funding to Spain is that it engenders a passive society. Because Europe is picking up the tabs for much of Spain's infrastructure, the Madrid government is able to 'afford' an unemployment level of 34 per cent of the working population in Andalucia. The southern swathe of the country, Andalucia is the equivalent of Italy's Mezziogiorno and it is also the chief political base of the ruling socialist party. Some 80 per cent of Andalucia's jobless population is now covered by unemployment benefits. Thirty years ago when there were no such unemployment benefits in General Franco's Spain, and long before structural funds had been thought of and the EIB created, Andalucia's jobless emigrated to work in the Common Market from where they sent home remittances, saved and eventually returned home to set up businesses. Whatever the political, economic and even moral arguments that might surround the sort of aid that the Madrid government receives, the fact is that Spain is an ideal recipient for such funds. It is a big country by European standards and it a poor one by that same yardstick. Spain has reached an intermediate level of development that requires the sort of specialised capital investment that the EIB provides and it has the political clout that carries weight when the share-out of the EU's structural funds is debated. Spanish officials have learnt the tricks of the borrowing trade and they have become adept at exploiting what in the EIB's case is a demand-driven business. 'The Spaniards are really looking for finance,' an EIB official conceded. There is also a great deal that requires financing in Spain. The Spanish recipients of the EIB loans range from small and medium-sized companies across the economic spectrum, to environmental initiatives, particularly in the water treatment sector which has major domestic deficiencies, and to the big infrastructure projects that deal with road and railroad transportation and electric cabling. It is no less true that the EIB is well below the ceiling it has set itself for loans and has considerable room for providing greater financial assistance in the years ahead. Loans this year to Spain, judging from those already signed and from those that are in the pipeline, are likely to be similar to 1993's record total.</p>

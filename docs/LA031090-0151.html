			<p><P> March 10, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Westport Savings Seized: Federal thrift regulators seized Westport Savings Bank  on Friday and put it in receivership, saying it was insolvent.  </P> <P> Its assets of $163 million were transferred to a newly created thrift called  Westport Federal Savings Bank, which was put under control of the Resolution  Trust Corp. In 1984, a group of South Orange County investors bought Westport,  which had opened in Hanford in 1979, and moved its headquarters to Mission  Viejo. The group later opened a branch in Laguna Beach. After a change in  directorship more than a year ago, the thrift moved its headquarters back to  Hanford.  </P></p>

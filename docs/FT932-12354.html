			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Hoover move to cut costs could threaten Scottish plant HOOVER EUROPE'S new president is re-examining controversial plans to close a French plant and switch production to Scotland as part of a sweeping management review intended to restore the company to profit. Mr Gerald Kamman said yesterday painful measures would be needed to ensure the survival of the company, which was continuing to lose heavily in the UK. He doubted that redundancies could be avoided and said some parts of the business might have to close. The review risks seriously embarrassing the British government, which last January applauded Hoover's decision to move vacuum cleaner production from Dijon to Cambuslang, near Glasgow, as evidence of the UK's competitiveness as a manufacturing base. The decision enraged French authorities, which threatened to take the UK to the European Court. If Hoover reversed the decision, it might re-inflame Anglo-French relations. The Scottish Office has offered Hoover Pounds 2.5m in regional aid, while Burgundy regional council said yesterday it was ready to make an extra financial effort to keep the Dijon plant open. Mr Kamman said no decisions would be taken until the review was completed next month. He emphasised that 'everything is being reviewed' and that he believed he was not committed to carrying out the planned transfer of production. 'These plans were put together by the previous management, and I have to make my own judgment on whether they make sense,' he said. 'We are going to have to do whatever is required for the viability of the company. If that means unwinding some things, we're going to have to unwind them. I wouldn't rule anything out.' Mr Kamman said he had not talked to government authorities in Britain or France. However, the Scottish Office said last night it was staying closely in touch with Hoover. 'Further developments at Cambuslang are a matter of considerable importance,' it said. The AEEU recently negotiated a no-strike deal with Hoover as part of the planned production transfer. Mr Jimmy Airlie, Scottish member of the AEEU's executive, urged his members to remain calm, saying he expected Hoover to honour its agreement. The three-week review is being carried out by four executives of Dixie-Narco, the vending machine subsidiary of Maytag, the US domestic-appliance manufacturer that owns Hoover. Mr Kamman headed Dixie-Narco until he was appointed president of Hoover Europe and UK managing director, after the dismissal of his predecessor as a result of the company's disastrous free flights sales offer. Mr Kamman said Hoover's losses, 80 per cent of which were in Britain, were not connected with the costs of the free flights promotion. Maytag had to make a Dollars 30m (Pounds 18.9m) provision to cover the costs of the campaign, leading the US company to report a Dollars 10m first-quarter loss. Although the previous management had reorganised Hoover and sought to improve its performance, costs were still too high and the UK company's budget assumed it would make a loss this year, Mr Kamman said. Hoover Europe lost Dollars 67.1m last year, after a Dollars 55m restructuring charge, on sales of Dollars 501.9m. Mr Kamman said the Dijon plant was close to making a manufacturing profit, and that Cambuslang was performing reasonably well. But overheads in much of the business had to be cut, and some product lines might have to be dropped. In a letter to employees, Mr Kamman said there was no option to reducing costs. 'The measures to accomplish this will have to be very strong and will require that we run our business in ways never considered before,' the letter stated. Task force may be Hoover's last stand, Page 31</p>

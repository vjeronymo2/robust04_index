			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Republicans promise new telecoms bill Senate Republican leaders are promising an all-out effort to pass new telecommunications legislation early next year. Sen Larry Pressler of South Dakota, who will take over as chairman of the Senate commerce committee when the new Congress meets in January, said he plans to meet other Republican senators, including Sen Robert Dole, the party's leader, to sketch out ideas for a telecommunications bill in the next two weeks. 'If we don't pass the bill next year I don't think it's going to happen in the election year,' he warned. Telecommunications legislation passed the House of Representatives this year. Although a similar bill was agreed by the Senate commerce committee, it never made it to the Senate floor, largely because of objections from Mr Dole. Companies in the telephone and broadcasting industries are increasingly anxious to have a new set of rules to replace the 60-year-old law which has been overtaken by technological and competitive changes. 'There seems to be unanimous agreement that if we could agree on a bill and get the rules set, everybody would be better off,' Mr Pressler said. The thrust both of this year's House bill and of the bill produced by Sen Ernest Hollings, the South Carolina Democrat from whom Mr Pressler will take over the committee chairmanship, was to let cable companies, local telephone companies and long-distance telephone companies enter each other's markets, though the different versions differed on how quickly this should happen in each sector. The activities of the Baby Bells, the regional telephone giants which have a near regional monopolies on local telephone service, are now restricted under terms of the court order which created them 10 years ago by breaking up the original AT&amp;T monopoly. Mr Pressler said he expected to produce a bill somewhere between the Hollings bill and the alternative proposed by Mr Dole, which leaned closer to the Bells' position.</p>

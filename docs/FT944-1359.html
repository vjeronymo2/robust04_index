			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / AT&amp;T wins UK licence for full range of telephone services AT&amp;T, the largest US telecoms carrier, has been given the go-ahead to offer a full range of telephone services in the UK, a move which will sharply intensify competition in the British telecoms market. The granting of a public telecommunications operator's licence to AT&amp;T was announced yesterday by Mr Ian Taylor, trade and technology minister, who also announced a similar licence for Concert, a joint venture between BT and MCI of the US. The announcement had been widely expected. AT&amp;T made its application in April 1993 and approval in principle was issued in the summer. The government's decision to award AT&amp;T a full licence, however, gives the US company an immediate advantage in its struggle with BT for the lion's share of the lucrative transatlantic business traffic. AT&amp;T will be able to provide domestic, switched voice and data services, private line and, importantly, 'international simple resale' services in the UK. International simple resale - a leased-line service which offers multinational companies cut-price transatlantic networks - is growing rapidly in importance. AT&amp;T's entry into the market is likely to bring lower telecoms costs for business customers on the transatlantic route where 'resellers' - US companies such as WorldCom or ACC - are already undercutting BT and Mercury Communications, the two largest UK telecoms operators. BT, however, is still waiting for the US Federal Communications Commission to give it approval to operate international simple resale between the US and UK. It already has partial approval and is hoping that the FCC will move quickly now that the UK has given AT&amp;T the go-ahead. Concert, based in Washington, aims to provide 'one-stop' telecoms services for multinational companies. It has been operating mainly in data services since the US authorities gave partial approval to the BT-MCI alliance in June this year. Mr David Quinn, AT&amp;T's European marketing director, said the company would be investing in the UK on a scale reflecting its ambition to be a force in the business and residential markets. He said the intention was not to double up on services available but build on AT&amp;T's technological strength and experience in the US to offer new services. Next year, he said, these would include frame relay  - a high-speed communications method between computer systems, international leased lines and advanced business networks. He said the company planned an orderly approach to the UK market. Services would first be provided over existing networks through partnerships with cable companies. In the long term, AT&amp;T would be prepared to build its own network including the 'local loop' between the exchange and the home or office.</p>

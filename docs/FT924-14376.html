			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Major takes pragmatic line on EC: Premier defends Maastricht treaty but pledges to protect Britain's national identity MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday sought to rally his party behind his personal brand of pragmatic Europeanism as the most turbulent Conservative conference since the 1970s ended in a more traditional display of public unity. In a closing speech designed to reconcile his determination to ratify the Maastricht treaty with the implacable opposition of the Tory Euro-sceptics, the prime minister pledged never to submerge Britain's national identity in a Federal Europe. But as he trod a careful line between the European enthusiasts and the sceptics in his party, Mr Major warned that reneging on the Maastricht agreement would mean 'breaking Britain's future in Europe'. The speech came as colleagues in Brighton said that a cabinet debate about whether sterling will rejoin the European exchange rate mechanism would be re-opened when the treaty had been ratified. In a relatively brief section of his speech devoted to the economy, Mr Major made only a passing reference to the ERM. But Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, has told colleagues he is ready to consider re-entry next year and several of the most senior members of the cabinet want to re-open the issue in the spring or summer of 1993. Without mentioning them by name, Mr Major dismissed the angry insistence of Lady Thatcher and Lord Tebbit earlier this week that Maastricht represented a blueprint for federalism. Accusing his opponents of tilting at windmills, he said: 'It is time to return the debate to reality and away from myth.' He then acknowledged the strength of opposition revealed by the emotive debates at the conference by stressing that his approach was guided by a single objective: 'a cold, clear-eyed calculation of the British national interest.' Reminding his audience of the dangers of division, Mr Major added: 'Unless we stay united, unless we stand together, as a party and as a nation, this country will never prevail.' His speech, which won warm applause from an audience exhausted by a week of public squabbling, was followed by confident forecasts from cabinet colleagues that the Maastricht treaty would now be ratified by the House of Commons. But after a week which saw open warfare among Tory party activists and a lukewarm reception for Mr Lamont's new economic strategy, ministers were acknowledging that the divisions over Europe would not disappear. The hard-core of Tory Euro-sceptics has promised a guerrilla war against the legislation in the Commons which may ensure that the treaty is not fully ratified until next spring. Cabinet ministers meanwhile are themselves divided on whether Britain should rejoin the ERM. The preference for managed exchange rates of Mr Douglas Hurd, Mr Kenneth Clarke and Mr Michael Heseltine is mirrored by the deep antipathy of Mr Michael Howard, Mr Peter Lilley and Mr Michael Portillo. Mr Major, who stressed the government's continuing commitment to low inflation, tight control of public spending and low taxation, was non-committal on the pace of economic recovery. But he emphasised that the sharp fall in the value of the pound gave British exporters a new 'competitive edge' in Europe. He signalled that the government would seek to ease the impact of a promised squeeze on public spending by encouraging joint public-private sector ventures to improve the nation's infrastructure. Mr Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, would also launch a drive to cut government regulation.

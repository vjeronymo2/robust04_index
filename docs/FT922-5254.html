			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / Barry ready to harry supporters of Militant: The man who today becomes leader of Britain's biggest Civil Service union THE TOP JOB at Britain's biggest Civil Service union changes hands today. But the elevation of Mr Barry Reamsbottom, a 43-year-old Scot, to the Pounds 43,000-a-year general secretary's post will inspire only limited envy, even among the most ambitious of trade unionists. In recent years internecine warfare between moderates and the far left at the CPSA has made the post one of the toughest and least rewarding among senior union jobs. Whereas most UK union general secretaries stay on until their retirement or near it, the two most recent incumbents of the CPSA have both left relatively early. Mr Alistair Graham quit in his early 40s and Mr John Ellis, who recently moved to head the Council of Civil Service Unions, is 53. Thus Mr Reamsbottom becomes the third man in a decade to take on the general secretary's job. He will make full use of the tough character his background and experience have equipped him with. Mr Reamsbottom learnt to fend for himself earlier than most when he spent eight years of his childhood in a Roman Catholic children's home after his parents separated. The experience also influenced his politics. 'Seeing the kids from problem families made me acutely aware of social injustice and I was out campaigning for the Labour party when I was 15,' he says. 'The nuns who ran the home considered me a communist.' The nuns were wrong if they thought he was developing into a political extremist: Mr Reamsbottom has always been in the mainstream of the Labour party. One of his first declarations on his election was that he would 'harry the alien influence of Militant' out of the organisation. That will prove virtually impossible. Militant has a stronger influence on the CPSA than it has on virtually any other union. It gained control of the executive in 1987-88 and will not give it up easily. However, for the first time for five years Militant has no supporter in any of the top six jobs at the union, and only three of the 26-strong executive are aligned to it. In addition, Mr Reamsbottom is perhaps better equipped than his predecessor to take on the left wing because he enjoys doing so. The latest edition of the union newspaper, which he edited, records with apparent pride how he was greeted with 'boos, catcalls and whistles' from the largely leftwing annual conference when it was informed of his election. Mr Reamsbottom would no doubt prefer not to have to deal with a conference which he describes as a 'crazy festival'. But he is adept at doing so, and with Mrs Marion Chambers, the union president, is famous for devising procedural and other methods to sidestep and thwart their wishes and motions if they are 'unrepresentative'. 'Barry is the archetypal machine politician,' says one admirer. 'Few people know the union as well as he does and is as comfortable operating within it.' Critics and even some of his supporters say he has yet to prove himself as a top negotiator. Such skills will be at a premium at a time when the government is planning profound changes through devolution of pay bargaining and contracting out of services to the private sector. The left wing, and not just in the CPSA, fear that Mr Reamsbottom will give too much away. Mr Leslie Christie, general secretary of the NUCPS Civil Service union, says: 'My concern is that he will collaborate with the employers almost at any price rather than fight back.' Mr Christie's fears have been heightened by the decision by Mr Reamsbottom and his executive to recommend this year's offer of a 4.75 per cent pay rise and a significant extension of performance pay. Mr Reamsbottom makes no apologies. 'We have doubts about performance pay, we would rather it wasn't there. But the government wants it and we are not going to fight the wind. 'By negotiating constructively, we have been able to ensure far greater protection for poor performers than was originally proposed. And we have a clause ensuring that devolution of pay bargaining will only happen with full consultation of the union.' Mr Reamsbottom promises a similarly pragmatic approach to competing with the private sector for tenders. 'We totally oppose the contracting out of services because of its effect on jobs and quality. But if it comes, we will negotiate the best framework possible and prepare ourselves to to win the contracts.' The threat to membership levels posed by contracting-out will be counterbalanced in part by opening regional offices, increasing contact with members and improving services. Mr Reamsbottom admits that none of that is particularly original. 'I do not have a great, grand strategy that no one has ever thought of, he says. 'But I do think that unions have become too remote from their members and that is a problem we can tackle by tried and tested means.'</p>

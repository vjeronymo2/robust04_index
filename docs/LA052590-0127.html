			<p><P> May 25, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SMALL BUSINESS: EVEN AT TINIEST COMPANIES, SAFETY PAYS  </P> <P> Bruce Hunter, service manager for Mike Thompson's R.V. Center in Santa Fe  Springs, knew he might have a problem if a state Occupational Safety and Health  Administration inspector visited his body shop. His technicians were sanding  and shaping fiberglass and metal without protective respirators.  </P> <P> Hunter's problem was solved when he bought a $900 respirator system. He acted  in the nick of time.  </P> <P> "Less than a month after I bought the system, the Cal/OSHA inspector arrived  and was really impressed with our respirator setup," said Hunter, who also  ordered industrial first-aid kits and oxygen bottles in case anyone has a heart  attack.  </P> <P> Small-business owners may think that they are too busy to worry about workplace  safety, but a single major accident can virtually cripple a small company.  Apart from the costs of workers' compensation benefits and medical bills, a key  worker's absence can be devastating.  </P> <P> The financial impact of workplace accidents is staggering. Each year, U.S.  businesses lose an estimated $42 billion to work-related illness and injuries,  according to the National Safety Council. Most on-the-job injuries are caused  by improper lifting, straining and twisting. Hitting or being hit by an object  is the second most common cause of injuries. Falls rank third, with  machine-related accidents fourth, the council says.  </P> <P> "Employees are demanding safer work environments," said Tom McKevitt, president  of Respond Industries of Denver, which has distributors in 23 states. "When  employers provide first-aid and pharmaceutical supplies, they find attendance  and productivity improves."  </P> <P> Ken Bray, vice president of direct operations for Zee Medical of Irvine, said  his staff tries to help small-business owners cope with the growing number of  workplace regulations. He said Zee, which sells oxygen bottles, first-aid kits  and other equipment, also offers a free on-site analysis to business owners  with no obligation to buy.  </P> <P> "We try to bring them as up to speed as we can and make recommendations as to  what they can do," said Bray. He said the company, which serves about 300,000  businesses in 50 states, offers a full accident-management program, including  training classes for employees.  </P> <P> Doug Schafer, facilities manager for Cassette Productions in Irwindale, said he  recently asked Zee to set up an earthquake preparedness and emergency first-aid  class for 10 of the audio cassette duplication company's 75 employees.  </P> <P> "We are not only meeting the OSHA regulations but keeping our employees safe,"  said Schafer.  </P> <P> OSHA requires all businesses to make first-aid supplies available to all  employees and to post safety instructions and warning signs. The rules also  call for businesses to keep a record of all workplace accidents in a log called  the "200 log."  </P> <P> First-aid and safety supplies are not as expensive as you might think. A small  business with 50 employees can buy enough basic first-aid supplies for about  $250 a year. Adding an oxygen bottle and a stretcher increases the cost to  about $500.  </P> <P> The success of any safety program depends on the total involvement of the  owner. Even the smallest company can create a safety committee.  </P> <P> The National Safety Council, an established, not-for-profit organization based  in Chicago, has thousands of booklets, posters, books and training materials  available to business owners and others. The group also has offices in Foster  City, Calif., and Syracuse, N.Y. For information write to: John Kaplafka, NSC,  444 N. Michigan Ave., Chicago, Ill. 60611. Or phone (312) 527-4800.  </P> <P> California business owners can call Cal/OSHA for free help from a safety  consultant. Unless the problem is life-threatening, the consultants are  prohibited from giving any information to the agency's compliance officers.  Cal/OSHA consultants are based in five offices. For information or an  appointment call:  </P> <P> Los Angeles: (213) 861-9993  </P> <P> San Diego: (619) 279-3771  </P> <P> San Mateo: (415) 573-3862  </P> <P> Sacramento: (916) 920-6131  </P> <P> Fresno: (209) 454-1295.  </P> <P> A SAFETY CHECK-UP  </P> <P> Create a safety committee to tour the company to check for hazards in every  department.  </P> <P> Make plans to correct the hazards before an accident occurs.  </P> <P> Develop ways to comply with all state and local health and safety regulations.  </P> <P> Investigate and record all workplace accidents.  </P> <P> Explore the need for protective clothing and equipment.  </P> <P> Make sure you have a fully stocked first-aid kit near each work area.  </P> <P> Post the address and phone number of the nearest hospital or clinic.  </P> <P> Offer your workers classes in first-aid and cardiopulmonary resuscitation  (CPR).  </P> <P> Keep track of how many work days were missed due to accidents or injuries.  </P> <P> Schedule regular safety meetings.  </P> <P> Prepare a written safety plan and circulate it to all employees.  </P> <P> Offer incentives for improved safety records, such as prizes or bonuses for  accident-free months.  </P></p>

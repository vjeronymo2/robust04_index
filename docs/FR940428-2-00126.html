			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The common stock of 19 of the 22 component companies is listed on the Exchange. The common stock of the other three component companies is traded through NASDAQ. At the outset, the common stock of each of the companies represented in the Health Care Portfolio will have equal representation. That is, the common stock of each company included in the portfolio shall be assigned a multiplier on the pricing date such that all component companies represent an equal percentage of the value of the entire portfolio on such date. The multiplier indicates the number of shares of common stock (or fraction of one share) included in the calculation of the portfolio. Thus, each of the 22 companies represented shall represent 4.545% of the total portfolio on the pricing date. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The multipliers assigned to the component companies will be adjusted for certain events such as stock splits, reverse stock splits, or stock dividends, and the value of the component securities will also be adjusted for certain events including a liquidation, bankruptcy, insolvency, merger, or consolidation involving the issuer of the underlying shares. For example, if the issuer of the shares underlying a component company has been subject to a merger or a consolidation and is not the surviving entity, then a value for such common stock will be determined at the time such issuer is merged or consolidated and will equal the last available market price for such common stock and that value will be constant for the remaining term of the Health Care Portfolio MITTS. <FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Merrill Lynch will not attempt to find a replacement stock or to compensate for the extinction of a security due to bankruptcy or a similar event. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based upon the reported prices of the common stock, a Merrill Lynch affiliate or an independent third party will calculate the value of the Health Care Portfolio on at least a daily basis and make those values available to investors. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> The Issuer <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Exchange has determined that the issuer of the Health Care Portfolio MITTS, Merrill Lynch, meets the listing criteria set forth in Section 703.19 of the Manual. The Exchange states that Merrill Lynch is an Exchange-listed company in good standing and has sufficient assets to justify the issuance of MITTS offerings of the size contemplated by the proposed rule change. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6 of the Act, in general, and with section 6(b)(5), in particular, in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B.

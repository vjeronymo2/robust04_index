He was responsible for organizing  the first loyalty oath to the Ukrainian people. He is the  codesigner of the first Ukrainian battle flag, and the military  unit in which he serves is the only unit in Ukraine that uses  this national (rather than the old Soviet) flag. He is the  author of the songs: "Return Me To My Homeland" and "The March  of the National Guard of Ukraine."    Oleksandr Lobashchuk is a registered candidate in the  election for the office of people's deputy in the Hvardiyskyy  Electoral District No. 260. His candidacy is supported by the  Union of Officers of Ukraine.    [Besyada] Lieutenant Colonel Lobaschuk, in your opinion, how  is the building up of the Ukrainian Army progressing?    [Lobashchuk] The building up of the Ukrainian Armed Forces  is  the most important and most difficult problem that our state  faces. Ukraine inherited her present military force from the  former Soviet Union, and, unfortunately, even today, its  sympathies are in large part pro-Russian, especially in the  highest command ranks. This is demonstrated in various ways. It  is revealed most strikingly in the military's attitude towards  the Ukrainian language, in the stubborn disregard of this  language, as, for example, by the generals. Even in Lviv, the  military procurator's office and military courts conduct all  their proceedings in Russian. As a result, the principal task in  building up an army that would be fully in line with the  people's interests requires providing it with genuinely national  cadres.    [Besyada] I fully agree with you. After all, is it  imaginable  for a true Ukrainian to declare that the rapid introduction of  the Ukrainian language in the army may provoke opposition among  the military, as Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy has stated?  And can we trust a man who has sworn loyalty to the Ukrainian  people, yet refuses to speak the language of this people?    [Lobashchuk] I believe that Mr. Radetskyy's statement  reflects his maneuvers aimed at simultaneously accomodating  Russia and benefiting Ukraine. This cannot be. The claim that it  is not possible to introduce the Ukrainian language in the army  quickly on the grounds that this supposedly requires special  programs and funds is completely unfounded. In any army (that is  the nature of an army) everything is determined by orders. I am  convinced that if a clear-cut order is issued, our army will be  able to switch completely to Ukrainian in the span of half a  year.    [Besyada] It seems that the situation in the Ukrainian Armed  Forces, just as in Ukraine as a whole, is not identical  throughout the country. We would therefore like to hear your  opinion regarding our Carpathian [Prykarpatskyy] Military  District, in particular.    [Lobashchuk] The population of Western Ukraine takes a more  responsible approach to the building up of a national Armed  Forces than do those living in the east or in the south. Here,  the idea of statehood is clearly defined in people's minds, and  this has a positive effect on the military. Consequently, the  Carpathian [Prykarpatskyy] Military District is in an  advantageous political and moral situation.    [Besyada] The Union of Officers of Ukraine played an  important positive role at the initial stages of the formation  of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. What are this organization's  objectives today?    [Lobashchuk] Yes. The Union did a great deal when the  building of the Ukrainian military began. It is also doing a lot  at present.    But with the coming of Mr. Radetskyy to office,  incomprehensible pressure began to be put on the Officers'  Union. At its fifth congress, held in December of last year, the  Union was forced to raise the issue point-blank: The UOU has to  send its members to parliament so that they can defend the  interests of what is indeed a national army within that  institution.    [Besyada] This brings us to a very important question --  elections to the Supreme Council. What is your election platform  based on?    [Lobashchuk] The substance of this platform is reflected in  its very name, for which I chose the famous lines from our Bard  [Taras Shevchenko]: "Our own law in our own house, our own  strength and will." I support a parliamentary-presidential  republic, a strong executive branch, and the elimination of the  local councils of people's deputies, which should be replaced by  a more traditional Ukrainian administrative organ, headed by a  supervisor [uporyadnyk] and a popular assembly [viche] elected  by the people at all levels -- ranging from the village to the  oblast. I am in favor of uniting all national-democratic parties  and movements as well as trade unions into a single political  force, which would implement the idea of a strong Ukrainian  state. The official language for everyone without exception in  government and military service is to be Ukrainian. I support  recognizing the Ukrainian Insurgent Army [UPA] as the fighting  arm in the struggle for Ukraine's independence.    I reject Leonid Kravchuk's statement: "We have what we  have."  I believe that we should have what we want, what the Ukrainian  people want. This requires a firm and resolute state policy that  would guarantee the people adequate food, housing, work, and  relaxation.    [Besyada] Naturally, your program devotes an important role  to the building up of the Armed Forces.    [Lobashchuk] This is an especially painful subject for me.  Because much that is being done in this sphere is not what the  people want. Even the date of Ukrainian Armed Forces Day was set  against the will of the people--not on the feast of St. Mary the  Protectress [Pokrova], but in traditional Soviet style, on the  date of the signing of the decree.    Ukrainian officers and ensigns [praporshchyky] and their  families need to be shown greater solicitude by the state. I  believe that in the very near future we must have a professional  army. This can only be done by applying the territorial  principle of military conscription. In other words, if a youth  lives in Galicia, he serves in Galicia. Incidentally, this is  the principle in effect in Germany.    In this, too, our Mr. Kravchuk has applied the old Soviet  exterritorial principle, which had only one goal -- to  intermingle various nations. The current justification given for  this system is couched in seemingly noble terms: Young men from  Western Ukraine will serve in Eastern Ukraine and thus spread  the use of Ukrainian in this region. This is pure bluff. Orders  are the only instrument by which the situation in the army is  determined.    I believe that our soldiers should serve only one year and  two months and be drafted only once a year in September and be  released from service in November. This would mean significant  savings for the state, and there are great social and economic  advantages to this. This would completely eliminate the shameful  phenomenon of "didivshchyna" [hazing of conscripts]. You should  have seen the faces of the soldiers when the Supreme Council  extended military service from one and a half years to two years  on 19 November of last year. The soldiers and their parents were  astonished by this swing in our state policy.    More attention needs to be devoted to the training of youth  for state service. Programs in schools and higher educational  institutions should include boot-camp type military training  [tabirnu viyskovu pidhotovku]. Young men should be given the  opportunity to become physically fit and become familiar with  military equipment and a military regimen. Then the army will be  receiving nearly fully trained professionals.    A great deal of pressure is being put on the National Guard  of Ukraine today, and there is an effort under way to eliminate  it. I, on the other hand, am for strengthening the National  Guard, because it is currently the best psychologically prepared  institution to defend Ukraine. Events in the Trans-Dniester  region and on the border with Belarus attest this.</p>

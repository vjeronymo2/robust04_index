			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Queens Moat asks banks for extension THE 65 banks owed Pounds 1bn by Queens Moat Houses, the hotel company suspended on the stock market last month, were yesterday urged to extend an interest and repayments standstill until the end of October. The company was supported by its bank steering committee, chaired by Barclays and National Westminster, and said the standstill would give Queens Moat time to arrange and propose a reconstruction to secure its longer term financing. Mr Andrew Coppel, appointed as consultant to Queens Moat last month, described the steering committee's support as 'extremely positive'. He said the company would be visiting its bankers over the next 10 days and a decision on whether they would back the standstill could come in the next few weeks. A statement from the steering committee last night pointed to 'very positive progress' in solving some of Queens Moat's problems. However, bankers expressed concern at a 'considerable reduction' in Queens Moat asset values, as revealed by a report from accountants Grant Thornton. The accountants also reported that Queens Moat made 'substantial losses' last year instead of profits of about Pounds 80m, as the City once expected. After a four hour meeting with the banks in the City offices of Allen and Overy, Queens Moat issued a short statement to confirm that Morgan Grenfell had replaced Charterhouse as its financial adviser and Coopers &amp; Lybrand had taken over as auditor from Bird Luckin. Mr Coppel, former finance director of Ratners, is expected to take over as chief executive if the banks agree to the standstill. Other board changes are likely. On Wednesday, Mr Martin Marcus and Mr David Hersey, formerly deputy chairman and finance director, resigned from the company. Coopers has begun work on a formal audit for last year, which suggests Queens Moat may seek to lift its suspension in the autumn. 'The board will address the question of the relisting when the 1992 results are available,' Mr Coppel said. Coopers is also reviewing the company's accounting policies, which have been heavily criticised since Queens Moat's problems became apparent, and blamed for some of the profits shortfall.</p>

			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Ministers feel long arm of the law The government has had a difficult week in the courts. On Wednesday, the Appeal Court ruled that Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, had acted unlawfully by introducing a new compensation scheme for victims of violent crime without referring it to parliament. On Thursday the High Court ruled that Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, had acted unlawfully in authorising Pounds 234m from the overseas aid budget for the Pergau Dam in Malaysia. The two embarrassing defeats underlined the growing willingness of the judiciary to curb abuses of executive power. Increasingly, it seems, where parliament has shown itself incapable or inept at placing adequate controls on the executive, judges are filling the void. Lawyers say there is nothing radically new in this. What this week's judgments show is the dramatic extent to which the ambit of judicial review has increased. Judicial review applications have risen from 160 in 1974 to 1,500 in 1987 and almost 2,900 last year. There were 1,851 applications in the first seven months of this year, against 1,728 in the same period last year. 'It's a continuation of a long-established trend,' said one leading public law QC. 'The courts more and more will look into areas which 20 years ago were regarded as the prerogative of the executive.' Twenty years ago, for example, the courts would not have intervened in the exercise of a minister's prerogative - non-statutory - powers as they did when overturning Mr Howard's criminal injuries compensation scheme. That bar to judicial intervention was removed by the House of Lords in 1985 in a case brought by the civil service unions against the government's attempts to ban unions at GCHQ, the government's listening post, at Cheltenham. As recently as 1984, when the government was attempting to prevent Sir Freddie Laker litigating against British Airways in the US, the courts took the view that they should support the government's stance on foreign affairs. No such sensibilities prevail now, as Mr Hurd discovered to his cost. The fact that the court was prepared to entertain a challenge from a pressure group, the World Development Movement, in the Pergau case also underlines the increasing breadth of judicial review. Until recently it proved difficult for groups to establish they had the necessary interest in a government decision to mount a court challenge. The courts took the view that an agglomeration of individuals each of whom had no interest in a decision could not, as a group, have an interest. That position has been discarded. The Law Commission, the government's law reform body, recently called for reform of the judicial review procedure to cut delays in handling challenges. The commission also endorsed the view that public-interest groups, as well as individuals, adversely affected by administrative decisions should in future have the right to apply for judicial review. The executive is more exposed to legal challenges than ever before - but for each government defeat in the courts, there are as many, if not more, victories. The lesson for ministers from this week's events must be to live within the law or risk a bloody nose in the courts.</p>

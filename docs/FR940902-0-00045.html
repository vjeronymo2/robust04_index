			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters thought that setting up Labor Management Committees should be listed as one of the allowable sole source criteria. The expenses incurred in the formation of these committees promoted by the State's Dislocated Worker Units would be a rapid response expense (section 314(b)(1)(B)), subject to the financial management and procurement procedures of the States. In most cases, it is expected that the costs of setting up a Labor Management Committee would not be great and that small purchase procedures may apply. Therefore, the regulations are not changed. If a committee were to apply to be a service provider, procurement rules would apply. If a committee, as a service provider, were to use JTPA monies to procure services for participants, procurement rules also apply.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 627.420(d) is reorganized by redesignating the subordinate paragraphs and including a new paragraph (d)(2), which authorizes units of State or local government or SDA and SSG administrative entities to pass through monies to like organizations, e.g., a public housing authority, and not have the procurement requirements apply. When monies are passed through, the receiving organization must either pass the monies through to a similar organization, or procure services in accordance with the procurement rules. The passing through of funds is a method of transferring monies to the actual entity doing the procuring which is practiced at the Federal, State, and local levels. The new language reflects this acceptable practice. The Department cautions that organizations which may receive pass throughs may also receive funds as service providers, in which case procurement rules will apply to awards to these entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A number of commenters submitted comments on &sect;627.420(e). Section 164(a)(3)(C) of the Act established the requirement that ``procurements shall include an appropriate analysis of the reasonableness of costs and prices.'' Several of the commenters disagreed with the use of the phrase ``cost or price analysis'' (as compared to ``cost and price analysis''). The Department interprets the requirement of ``an appropriate analysis'' to mean that recipients and subrecipients are required to do whatever analysis (price or both cost/price) is appropriate to their situation. This is supported by OMB Circular A&hyph;102, which requires a price analysis alone under very limited circumstances, and requires a price analysis whenever a cost analysis is undertaken. Additionally, the commercial reality is that in many cases you either cannot do both a cost and price analysis (when there are no market prices or historical contract prices available) or it would be superfluous to do both (when what is being bought is available at catalogue prices).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Concern was also expressed over the requirement that recipients and subrecipients perform a cost or price analysis in connection with every procurement, including modifications. Some commenters believed that the paragraph (e)(1) requirement for a cost or price analysis for all modifications should be changed to exclude non-monetary modifications. After consideration of this concern, paragraph (e)(2) is amended to reflect this exclusion. Care should be taken, though, in determining which modifications do not have monetary implications. For example, a modification to reduce the number of participants may, on its face, appear to be non-monetary. This is not the case. A modification to reduce the number of participants, without a corresponding reduction in funding, results in an increase in the cost per participant. Therefore, this type of modification is one which has monetary impact.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 627.420(e)(2) describes cost or price analysis requirements. This paragraph is revised in order to make it easier to read, but the requirements are not changed. This paragraph requires recipients and subrecipients to make independent estimates before receiving bids or proposals. This requirement, which also comes from OMB Circular A&hyph;102, appears to have caused confusion. A number of commenters felt that SDA's would not be able to develop such estimates, due to the fact that they do not know which specific activities will be offered by a service provider until offers are received in response to RFP's. In those cases where it is not known what specific services will be provided, it will be appropriate for recipients and subrecipients to develop ``rough yardsticks,'' such as cost per placement or cost per enrollee, for specific types of training. These independent estimates are used, in part, as a tool to determine whether or not the proposals are correctly responding to the technical requirements of the RFP. The estimates are also used to determine the reasonableness of costs/prices which are offered. An offer which is priced too low may be indicative of, among other things, an offeror who does not understand the requirements of the RFP. An offer which is priced too high may contain more expensive interventions than are required. Only through the comparison of the costs and prices contained in each offer with the estimate can these potential problems be identified. It should be stressed, however, that the independent estimates are not absolute barriers to accepting higher or lower cost proposals; the estimates are merely meant for internal guidance. An awarding agency may select for award a proposal that is more or less costly than the estimates, if it determines that the costs and price(s) are reasonable and that the services offered meet program requirements. The level of detail that recipients and subrecipients need in developing these estimates may be specified by the Governor in the State standards. Several commenters indicated that awarding agencies should include the independent estimates in the RFP. Under no circumstances is this to be done. Since the purpose of developing the estimates is for internal control, publicizing them would defeat the purpose for which they are developed and might also skew the bidding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

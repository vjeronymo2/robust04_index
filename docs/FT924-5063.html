			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Disposals aid Brown Shipley BROWN SHIPLEY, the merchant banking group, yesterday announced an interim pre-tax profit of Pounds 8.55m after disposals aimed at streamlining its stockbroking and investment management business. In the corresponding period the group had reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 13.8m. However, at the operating level the group incurred losses of Pounds 839,000 (profits Pounds 458,000). Last time continuing operations made losses of Pounds 2.3m and discontinued activities profits of Pounds 2.76m. The pre-tax turnround was achieved after an exceptional credit of Pounds 9.73m, derived from the Pounds 24.8m profit from the sale of Holmwoods, its insurance broking operation, less the Pounds 11.2m loss on the sale of the banking arm, a Pounds 2m write-off of fixed assets, Pounds 1.2m provisions against surplus office space, and Pounds 616,000 provisions for reorganisation. The exceptional debit last time of Pounds 11.5m was for bad debt provisions. Brown Shipley has also sold Leasing Management Services, its leasing business, for Pounds 5.9m. Mr Bill Dacombe, chairman, warned that further restructuring would involve write-offs and bad debt provisions of Pounds 3.8m. These moves would allow the group 'to develop a successful, integrated house providing investment advice and management to private and institutional clients'. At September 30 funds under management totalled Pounds 2.4bn, with Pounds 600m managed on a fully discretionary basis. Turnover was Pounds 8.82m (Pounds 19.1m), earnings 40p (losses 87p) and again there is no dividend.</p>

			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / Prince hits at lack of support for royal visits The Prince of Wales is frustrated at what he sees as lack of support from some powerful government departments for royal visits abroad which could help secure business for Britain. The prince wants more support for his role as a commercial and cultural ambassador for Britain when he goes abroad as part of his role as heir to the throne. The prince's frustration emerged during his recent tour of the Middle East when he visited projects involving British companies in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait. A Financial Times correspondent travelled with the prince and was given full access as he met the Gulf rulers, government and business leaders. The prince has tried with little success inviting UK government departments to co-ordinate a more strategic approach to getting the most out of his visits. Fresh attempts are being made by the prince's private office to improve links with Whitehall, particularly with the DTI, which has itself embarked on an ambitious programme to help boost British exports. The prince feels senior officials have underestimated the potential benefits for UK companies from his role as royal envoy. According to one of his inner-circle: 'Parts of Whitehall still see royal visits in an anachronistic way. A certain amount of re-education is required and is underway.' During his middle east trip, British businessmen and Arab ministers frequently endorsed the value of his visit. Mr Peter Marshall, managing director of John Brown Engineering, which is active in Saudi Arabia, said the visit should help it conclude a Pounds 110m project management contract.

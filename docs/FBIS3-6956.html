			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, March 23 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam  said Wednesday the government would keep open a dialogue channel  with Pyongyang, while increasing cooperation with the United  States, Japan, China, Russia and other countries in dealing with  the North Korean nuclear problem.    Kim made the remarks at a breakfast he hosted for Prime  Minister Yi Hoe-chang, other cabinet members and his senior  secretaries at Chongwadae [presidential offices] prior to  departing for Japan and China on state visits Thursday.    "North Korea is secretly developing nuclear arms despite its  promise of denuclearization and is increasing propaganda  broadcasts against the South to instigate people to topple the  government," he said. "What we can and must do now is win this  fight without a war."    Kim said he would use his meetings with Japanese Premier  Morihiro Hosokawa and Chinese President Jiang Zemin as an  opportunity to ask for their cooperation in settling the North  Korean nuclear row.    "North Korea has been insincere and perfidious in the  dialogue with us and I thus expected the dialogue to break down.  But the situation that developed last Saturday was far beyond  my imagination. I cannot help regarding the harsh language used  by the chief North Korean delegate while reading from a prepared  text, not as that spoken by the delegate himself but as words  uttered by the supreme authority of Pyongyang."    The government should tell the people the truth to help  develop its own national power, he stressed.    The government should not create a sense of crisis among the  people, as its predecessors did in exaggerating the threat posed  by a North Korean water attack, solely to establish its position  more firmly.    The chief executive noted that irresponsible remarks are  being made in certain quarters despite the fact that the people  are aware of North Korea's intention since they have access to  North Korean broadcasting through TV. He said the government  should inform all citizens of any developments pertaining to  their safety.    On the Patriot deployment, he said the anti-missile missiles  are an improved version of those used in the Gulf war and will  thus play an important part in the nation's defense.    Kim said he expects the UN Security Council will start with  a  mild resolution on North Korea, with the approach gradually  escalating depending on Pyongyang's response. "The government  will cooperate closely with the U.S. Government if developments  in the dispute at the UN Security Council warrant such  cooperation."    He said he had taken steps to ensure that he can receive  reports from the government 24 hours a day during his seven-day  tour of Japan and China.</p>

			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Leading Article: Route to success THE CONFEDERATION of British Industry yesterday produced a report on education and training for 16 to 19-year-olds which is a welcome reminder that, even in these ill-tempered times, sensible solutions to long-standing problems can be proposed and have some chance of implementation. Few people outside the educational/training cognoscenti are likely to read the report, which is weighed down with the usual acronyms, but its message is well known enough: the education system in Britain produces a small number of highly educated people with no training or work experience, and a rather larger number of people with training but little education. Business, as the CBI says, needs people who are numerate, literate and have core skills - the ability to communicate, to apply technology, work with others, solve problems and respond to change. The fact that it is not getting them in sufficient numbers is largely because of the Achilles' heel of education and training provision for 16 to 19-year-olds. The CBI has come up with some interesting ideas, not all of which are brand new, but which together amount to a coherent strategy. The most radical is the plan to extend the existing experiment with training credits to embrace all training and education for 16 to 19-year-olds. The CBI proposes that over the next few years young people should be using credits to buy their academic sixth-form education and their technical training at a further education college as well as a training place with an employer. The idea will meet with stiff resistance from the educational establishment but it has the potential to keep the educational providers on their toes and motivate young people. Through putting pressure on non-training employers it also goes some way to meet the critics of the voluntarist approach to training. Above all, providing the same form of finance for the high-status sixth-form, the low-status FE college and workplace training, it provides a boost to parity of esteem. A useful side-effect of a universal credit system would be to raise the status of careers guidance officers, who would become crucial sources of information on where to spend the credits. The CBI rightly says that additional government investment is required in careers guidance and recommends that every young person should have at least four hours of such guidance. The idea of a single framework of exams and qualifications stretching from vocational NVQs to academic A-levels and a system of awards mixing the academic and vocational called 'careership certificates' is more problematic. The principle may be right, but it would threaten the existing system with overload. The building blocks of the system - NVQs and GNVQs - are both in their infancy, while the last official attempt to produce a combined qualification, the Advanced Diploma, has not been a success.</p>

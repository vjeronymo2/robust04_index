			<p><P> April 14, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Lotus, Novell Sued Over Merger Plan: Two stockholders have gone to court to  block the proposed $1.4-billion merger of software giants Lotus Development  Corp. and Novell Inc., the companies said.  </P> <P> The class-action lawsuit in Delaware Chancery Court seeks an injunction against  the proposed merger, which sent shares of both companies tumbling after it was  announced last week. The suit, filed by Novell shareholders Stephen Maskaleris  and Herbert Podell, contends that Novell and its directors breached their  fiduciary duties to shareholders in agreeing to merge with Lotus. Novell said  it and Lotus believe that the suit is without merit and intend to defend  against it vigorously.  </P></p>

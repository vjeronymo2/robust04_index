			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / UK Company News: Wm Low shrugs off consumer spending decline with 9% rise WM LOW, the Dundee-based food retailer, yesterday announced an 9 per cent increase, from Pounds 10.49m to Pounds 11.42m, in pre-tax profits for the 28 weeks to March 16. Mr James Millar, chairman and chief executive, said that operating profit had been maintained at Pounds 11m despite only one new store opening and additional costs in distribution and information technology. The downturn in consumer spending had hit the small older stores but had only had a marginal effect in the majority of its outlets, he said. The Pounds 37.9m rights issue last December helped eliminate borrowings and net interest receivable totalled Pounds 403,000 (payable Pounds 590,000). Mr Millar said the results showed how crucial the rights issue had been in funding the group's development programme. 'Our decision to be one of the first companies to tap the market for cash - criticised by some at the time  -has been vindicated,' he said. Mr Millar said the group was only interested in expanding through organic growth. It had made two abortive attempts to expand through acquisition, including a plan to buy Gateway's northern stores from Isosceles, some of which were sold to Kwik Save yesterday for Pounds 26.5m. Low is using the cash raised from the rights issue to open more stores over the next two years. It has a large schedule of committed new openings which will add at least 155,000 sq ft by September 1992. The group incurred significant additional costs from the setting up of the new multi-temperature Livingston depot, which was recently brought on stream, and the programme to upgrade the information systems. This affected the operating margin which fell from last year's 6 per cent to 5.6 per cent. The group expects trading to remain static during the remainder of the year. Turnover rose to Pounds 198.45m (Pounds 185.05m) and fully diluted earnings per share edged up to 13.5p, compared to 12.86p. The interim dividend is raised to 2.7p (2.5p).</p>

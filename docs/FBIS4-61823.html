			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Viktor Litovkin report: "Until Black Sea Fleet Is Divided </F> Up, War of Nerves Continues"]    [Text] News agency reports are often like a psychological  machinegun burst. It is sometimes even terrifying to take hold  of them since you suddenly have another bomb on your hands.    Our correspondent in the Crimea had not had time to tell us  of a provocative report on an allegedly political attack on the  wife of the commander of the Black Sea Fleet before the  editorial office received another similar report from ITAR-TASS.  From the Ukrainian Defense Ministry's press service. They  accuse their Russian colleagues of "preparing to hijack to  Russia missile-carrying Tu-22 aircraft from Black Sea Fleet air  force regiments."    Ukraine claims that it is planned to make this flight  against  the backdrop of routine tactical air exercises I called one of  the leaders of the Navy's air forces and asked: Is this true?  The general was indignant: "It's out-and-out lies." And he  complained that pilots are not being allowed to fly because of  these persistent suspicions for which there is incidentally no  documentary corroboration. And a pilot, even a top-notch pilot,  who has spent a month or two on the ground, is no longer a  pilot, but at best a trainee. Well, he asked sadly, have people  now lost the right to a profession, to earn a crust, owing to  the political wrangling?    I had just cleared up the situation involving the aircraft  when television announced: Army General Vitaliy Radetskyy,  Ukrainian defense minister, has banned Admiral Igor Kasatonov,  first deputy commander in chief of the Navy, from flying to  Sevastopol to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the city's  liberation from the fascist occupiers, a ceremony to which the  Russian admiral was invited by 20 organizations in Sevastopol.    I contacted the admiral's aides. They confirmed that this  had happened -- Kasatonov stayed in Moscow while Vice Admiral  Ivan Vasilyev, Navy deputy commander for rear services, had to  fly to Sevastopol. His candidacy caused no particular  objections in Kiev's military-ministerial circles.    Admittedly, the fax machine has "fired" another mind-blowing  charge -- an open letter from his former fellow servicemen in  the Northern Fleet -- at another admiral, this time a Ukrainian:  Volodymyr Beskorovaynyy, commander of that country's Navy. What  epithets the admirals and captains first and second rank  directed at him. I cannot cite them -- the paper would not  withstand it. And all because Beskorovaynyy behaved unworthily,  according to the men of the Northern Fleet, during the conflict  with the Cheleken hydrographic ship.    Not only is it surprising that the open letter carries 30  signatures and names with posts ranging from deputy commander of  a formation of nuclear submarines to the commander of an  individual unit -- a few years ago you would have been flung in  jail for that kind of list -- but also that undoubtedly worthy  people hope that appeals of this kind today can stop a  particular political action.    I do not want to accuse anyone, much less defend anyone. I  just want one thing -- a truce in this war of nerves and  mind-blowing information. I realize that it is pointless urging  politicians to behave nobly, but perhaps journalists can do so  by declaring a moratorium on reports that cause political  explosions.</p>

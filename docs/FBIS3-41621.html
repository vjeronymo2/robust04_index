			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Moscow's government has passed a programme of  ecological measures in the city's power industry which will make  it possible to lower atmospheric pollution in the capital  considerably.    The implementation of the programme will make it possible to  lower the emission of nitric oxides 2-2.5-fold, sulphur dioxide  1.5-2-fold, oil products jointly with service water 8-10-fold,  sulphates 5-6-fold, while virtually, eliminating suspended  particles emissions, all by 2010. However, it is still unclear  whether it will be at all possible to implement this scheme. The  point is that nature-conserving undertakings are relatively  capital intensive in the power industry. The cost of purifying  installations in the West alone comes to 40 percent of the cost  of the basic plant. The programme makes provision for the  creation of a special-purpose section at the Moscow City  Ecological Fund which will be busy accumulating funds to  modernize the power industry. Energy producers insist on  introducing increments on electricity and heating tariffs by  approximately 1-3 percent. From the standpoint of consumers it  would be fairer if producers were to deduct a certain sum for  ecological measures from their payments for environmental  pollution.    This year power industry workers have been able to collect  1.5 billion roubles from different sources. On the other hand,  four billion roubles will be required annually for the  installation of catalytic nitrogen purification equipment for  Moscow's thermoelectric plants alone. Unless serious investments  in the programme have been found, Muscovites will have to  continue to inhale polluted air even in the 21st century.</p>

			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PERSONALITY  </P> <P> Elizabeth Townsend has been named vice president/general manager of Townsend  Leasing. She will be responsible for overseeing all leasing operations in the  downtown leasing office.  </P> <P> When Townsend joined her father and brother in the family-operated automotive  dealership a year ago, she became a member of the third generation of Townsends  to sell and lease cars in San Diego. Her grandfather started the business in  1927 selling Studebakers.  </P> <P> "My grandfather had a dealership on the corner of State and B downtown,"  Townsend said. "I remember the little jingle he had on the radio, and I still  run into customers of his who are now in their 70s and 80s."  </P> <P> Townsend, 32, is a graduate of Stanford University with a degree in history.  After living in Florence, Italy, for seven months studying art, she moved back  to San Diego and earned her master's degree in business administration from the  University of San Diego.  </P> <P> Despite family tradition, Townsend did not immediately jump into the automotive  business. Her first job out of college was assisting the vice president of the  Metro YMCA of San Diego County. Before her arrival at Townsend, she spent two  years as an account representative for the Adcentive Group, a San Diego-based  specialty advertising company.  </P> <P> "My father and brother came to me and said, 'You're selling ads, why not cars?'  " Townsend said. "My father had thought of starting a leasing company, and he  wanted to teach me the business."  </P> <P> Townsend said she wanted to get involved in what she sees as the "renaissance  of downtown." "Thirty years ago, there used to be all dealerships here in  downtown," she said.  </P> <P> "Our leasing company is geared toward the professional or downtown person.  Leasing is for everybody, but professionals in particular seem to like how it  fits into their life style of a new car every two years." CAROLYN LEMKE  </P></p>

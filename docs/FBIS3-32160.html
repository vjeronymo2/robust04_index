Mr. Penafiel, I  understand the National Committee of Transportation Workers met  today at 1400. Have transportation workers reached an agreement  with the national government regarding the subsidy that was  being negotiated during the past days? Welcome to Radio Quito.    [Penafiel] Many thanks to Radio Quito once again. Actually,  we were waiting for National Executive Committee members to  arrive in order to hold a meeting to discuss mainly if we were  going to accept and support the measure [words indistinct] for  tomorrow. We were planning to meet here in my home, but since  I am still ill, fellow delegates decided to meet at federation  installations. My colleagues have resolved to resume regular  activities tomorrow so long as the guarantees are still standing.    Now [word indistinct] they will take care of putting the  vehicles away in the garage of [word indistinct] to prevent any  possible attacks against us. So far we only have 37 vehicles  operating in the city of Quito.    Regarding the subsidy, 1 million sucres have been accepted  for vehicles that use gasoline engines and 700,000 sucres for  those that use diesel engines.    In view of this, we have confirmed that the government's  offer is not fair or complete. Fellow delegates have been  willing to sacrifice for Ecuadoreans' peace of mind. I believe  the government's offer is not fair because the highest fares  remain unchanged, and transportation workers will have to be  compensated by the transportation sector.    [Ramos] Many thanks, Mr. Penafiel, for your participation.  We reiterate the announcement that transportation workers will  resume their regular operations tomorrow.</p>

			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Brazil buys 7 UK warships Brazil's navy is to buy seven ships from Britain for about Pounds 100m in the second large arms deal between the two countries this year. Brazil is buying four type 22 frigates and three river class minesweepers which the British navy put up for sale earlier this year. The frigates, built between 1976 and 1980, are no longer needed following the post-cold war fleet reduction. In January this year Westland, the UK helicopter maker, won a Pounds 150m order for nine Super Lynx helicopters from the Brazilian navy. British officials hope the Brazilians will choose Westland again when they equip the newly acquired frigates. The frigates are the Broadsword, Brazen, Brilliant and Battleaxe and will be delivered over the next three years. The minesweepers Humber, Helmsdale and Ribble will be delivered next year. Several of the world's leading arms exporters are looking at Brazil as a potential growth market, even though its armed forces budget has suffered from years of cutbacks. Mr William Perry, the US Secretary of Defence, visited Brazil this week to discuss a number of potential defence contracts and Brazil is also looking to Russia and China for limited arms purchases. The British deal marks the end of a year of increased contact between the two countries, restoration of British export credit cover and several British ministerial visits to Brazil, including that of Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, in April. Britain is also close to finalising an extradition treaty with Brazil and discussions have started on a double taxation treaty. The contract was signed by Brazilian vice-admiral Armando de Senna Bittencourt and Mr Michael Robinson, assistant director of the UK's Defence Export Sales Office.</p>

			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Jobs blow for Stoke potters Redundancy notices were handed yesterday to 232 pottery workers at Ironstone Tableware in Shelton, Stoke-on-Trent. Mr Ian Powell of Price Waterhouse, one of the administrative receivers appointed to the company earlier this month, said he could not rule out job losses among the remaining 208 workers. There had been only 'limited interest' from prospective purchasers of the business.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tirana, May 31 (ATA) -- Eduard Selami, chairman of  the DP [Democratic Party], delivered a press conference on the  main results of the elections for the local government in five  zones of Albania. Mr. Selami declared that DP has won 66.4  percent against 18 percent of the previous elections, in  Greshice 67.7 percent against 17 percent against of the previous  elections, in Gracan 66 percent, in Rec of Diber, the DP won  55.7 percent of votes, while in Zallherr of Tirana they will  hold a second round of elections. Tritan Shehu, DP secretary  general, and Ali Spahia, DP deputy chairman, were also present  in the press conference.    The DP, declared Mr. Selami, has made significant progress  in  these elections, while the SP is marking decreases. The  comparison of the results is the best proof of the elections.  The votes which the electors cast for the DP candidates will  encourage the DP to implement strictly its program. Mr. Selami  said that the program of the democratic government is one of the  most successful of Eastern Europe.    The elections of the May 29th were the best answer for those  political forces, which have had the new elections their  political motto since March 1992. Mr. Selami considered the  victory of his party as very important also for the continuation  of the reform. The success has also been a result of the  realistic campaign conducted by DP, it had in an open dialogue  with the people.    Referring to the SP [Socialist Party] press conference on  May  29 and its declaration, Mr. Selami said the facts revealed in it  are not true. "I have stated," said Selami, "even before the  results of the elections that if there is any violation of  rules, competent bodies will adopt the necessary measures." Mr.  Selami said that for violations noticed in two zones,  responsibility should fall on the electoral commissions, whose  chairmen were members of the SP and not of the DP, and  unfortunately they have created conditions for  mis-interpretations and tensions.    Mr. Selami considered the focusing of the attention on the  Nano question as a factor which has influenced in the loss of  SP. He said that in all the meetings he had had with people of  the remotest communes, he had never been asked about Nano case.  The SP conducted its electoral campaign to defend Nano, which  according to Selami, was a question which made them aim at a  wrong target.    Answering the questions how he considered the lower results  of the SP, Mr. Selami said that SP policy has been a tensional  and nihilistic one, which served those who are in trial,  mentioning here the case of misinformation by the socialist  press and also the cases of insults and offense towards the  leaders of DP.    Asked about the non-participation of DA [Democratic  Alliance]  in the elections, Mr. Selami said that DA happened to be in the  Albanian political life due to the stolen mandate of DP. While  on the insignificant victory of the other political parties, the  DP leader said that Albania will continue to have for a certain  period of time the system of two big parties, while the other  parties will have it difficult to find their way.</p>

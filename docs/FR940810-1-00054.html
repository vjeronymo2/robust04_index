			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (3) In conducting performance reviews, HUD will rely primarily on information obtained from the recipient's performance report, records maintained, findings from on-site monitoring, audit reports, and the status of the line of credit. Where applicable, the Department may also consider relevant information pertaining to a recipient's performance gained from other sources, including litigation, citizen comments and other information provided by the recipient. A recipient's failure to maintain records in the prescribed manner may result in a finding that the recipient has failed to meet the applicable requirement to which the record pertains. A recipient's failure to submit a performance report in the prescribed manner may result in a finding that the recipient has substantially failed to meet the requirements of the program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 14.

Failure to so demonstrate in a timely manner will be cause for HUD to find that the recipient has failed to meet its certification. A complete and specific response by the recipient should describe:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Any factors beyond the control of the recipient that prevented it from following its CHAS and any actions the recipient plans to take to alleviate such factors; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Actions taken by the recipient, if any, beyond those described in the CHAS performance report to facilitate following the CHAS, including the effects of such actions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 15.

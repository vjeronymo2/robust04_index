			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / Business Travel: 'But which one goes first?' - The confusing choice of trains between London and Gatwick Business travellers arriving at London's Gatwick airport now have three choices of rail service into the capital. In theory, this should make it easy for weary voyagers to pick the first train heading in their direction. The reality is sadly disappointing. The choices are part of the run-up to the UK government's railway privatisation programme. The Gatwick Express, the non-stop link between the airport and London's Victoria station is to be privatised this year. It now faces competition from two divisions of British Rail - Network SouthEast and Thameslink. The problem with such variety is that, if it is to be useful, we have to know that there is a choice, and have enough information to make one. If you are travelling to Gatwick from central London, a flashing neon information board at Victoria station tells you which Gatwick Express leaves next. But what you really need is one that tells you which service leaves next, regard-less of the operator. Business travellers leaving the flight arrival hall at Gatwick, on the other hand, have to make their first choice as they move towards British Rail's booking hall. Two large posters stand over the entrance; one advertises the Gatwick Express, the other BR's Thameslink service to the City of London. Now here is a real, and useful, choice - between travelling on the Gatwick Express into the capital's Victoria station, with its excellent connections and proximity to the West End, or making your way via Thameslink to London Bridge, the City Thameslink station, and then King's Cross for stations to the north. But by the time you have reached the station booking hall this choice has probably been lost under an advertising onslaught from the Gatwick Express. The booking hall appears to have been decorated for a papal visit. Maroon banners hang from the ceiling promoting Gatwick Express. The first three booking windows, inevitably decked out in maroon, are for Gatwick Express. Beyond those booking windows are the ones for BR's Network SouthCentral service to Victoria. This service is three minutes slower than Gatwick Express's, but slightly cheaper. But what flight-weary travellers are probably most interested in is which will get them to Victoria first. When trying to buy a Network SouthCentral ticket, I was told by staff at the booking window that there was a faster alternative. I was not told I could choose an alternative destination, via Thameslink, or that the Network SouthCentral train might leave before a Gatwick Express anyway. The most useful information in the booking hall is a modest-sized, framed poster summarising the destinations available, the prices and the frequency of service. These are displayed by the booking windows - which means that after queueing for a ticket you may discover you have been waiting in the wrong place. Tickets are transferable between the services, but I could see nothing to inform the average traveller of this. Supplements have to be paid if you move to Gatwick Express. So how do the services compare? Gatwick Express's principal advantage is that it leaves every 15 minutes, and is clearly signposted at both ends of the journey. The trains are immaculate, with extra room for luggage. The price is Pounds 8.60, or Pounds 13 for club class (Dollars 12.72 and Dollars 19.24 respectively). SouthCentral has older stock, is less comfortable and has probably arrived from Brighton, or elsewhere in the south of England. It can therefore be quite full. Network SouthCentral plans to run a service every 15 minutes from May. The price is Pounds 7.50 (Pounds 11.30 first class). Thameslink currently runs twice an hour, but has plans for more frequent services. It charges Pounds 7.50 to London Bridge, Pounds 8 to City Thameslink. The trains are clean, roomy, but not as comfortable as the Gatwick Express. Thameslink is useful if you want to go direct to the City of London or to make a connection to the north at King's Cross. My Gatwick Express from Victoria to the airport was smart, clean and air-conditioned. At another platform was a Network SouthCentral train, which was crowded and grimy - but it left first.</p>

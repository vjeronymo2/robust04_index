			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, June 1, IRNA -- A morning daily here  Wednesday [1 June] recommended the Iranian authorities to  reconsider Tehran's relations with London and take a more  calculated and deliberate stance vis-a-vis Britain.    Criticizing the recent British charges against Iran  including  the alleged Tehran's support for the Irish Republican Army (IRA)  and the expelling of Iranian charge d'affaires from Britain,  `JOMHURI-E ESLAMI' wrote in a commentary that the British  officials have launched an "extensive propaganda campaign  against the Islamic Repulic of Iran with an aim to satisfy  American statesmen."    The article referred to the forthcoming visit to Britain of  the U.S. President Bill Clinton, scheduled next Sunday, and said  that the British mass media, by resorting to fabricated  allegations, once again are trying to accuse Iran of having  supported the IRA.    The British officials have created a smokey screen whenever  they had failed in their foreign policy, said the article adding  that the present propaganda ploy against Tehran comes in the  aftermath of the last month disclosure of Britain's  eavesdropping at the Iranian Embassy in London.</p>

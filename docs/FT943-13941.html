			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Property: When home is just a short iron away - So golf is your religion and heaven is living near your local course? Gerald Cadogan examines the possibilities Keen golfers moving house always want to know about the nearest course and how good it is. It follows that the best way to find out is for them to take their clubs and play 18 holes - as an essential part of househunting. As they watch the 123rd Open championship at Turnberry in south-west Scotland this weekend, they can dream of owning a house within a chipping wedge of any of the venues where the Open is played. Or any course, for that matter. A more costly option is actually to buy a working course, or acquire a greenfield site with planning permission for a course and develop it. Those with real money might even like to buy a house with its own private course. Agent Roger Pryor, of Strutt &amp; Parker, says the market for working courses has stabilised following the property boom of 1988-89 and the subsequent fall. As for new courses, planning applications in the south-east were, by 1993, more than 60 per cent down from their peak in 1990-91 - but 46 per cent of these were granted, compared with 25 per cent in 1991. The change has come about because land-owners, developers and local planners have become stricter in assessing the earnings potential of a course and its impact on the community and environment. The banks, which lost large amounts in funding grandiose schemes, are more circumspect too. Today, planning permission for a golf course does not provide an automatic premium over agricultural value, says Jim Bryant, of Bidwells' leisure team. Gone are the 1988-89 days of Pounds 15,000 an acre. Pryor agrees. Only prime sites are likely to achieve a top premium of Pounds 1,000 an acre - which equates to a total price per acre of about Pounds 3,000. That sort of figure is reflected in the Pounds 350,000 being asked by Savills of Banbury for a 121-acre site with permission for an 18-hole pay-and-play course at Cadmore End, near High Wycombe in Buckinghamshire. It is close to the M40, and 630,000 people live within 30 minutes' drive. A pay-and-play alternative nearby has a long waiting list, and Wycombe district council accepts there is continuing demand. Strutt &amp; Parker estimates that, at the end of 1993, there was an 18-hole course for every 15,332 people in south-east England (if those with planning consent are included). This is half the pre-1989 ratio of one existing course for every 31,555 people but, says the agent, not all the consents will be taken up. County ratios vary widely. Oxfordshire offers one course for every 21,267 people, Buckinghamshire 1:10,230 and Surrey 1:9,550 (using the total of existing and agreed courses). Developing a greenfield site can cost up to Pounds 1m, depending on the design and terrain. But it could be two years before members join and the cash starts to come in. At Cadmore End, the estimate for development costs is between Pounds 600,000 and Pounds 750,000 (to include a 4,000 sq ft clubhouse). In the first full year, the agent expects 35,000 rounds at, say, Pounds 10 apiece on weekdays and Pounds 15 at the weekend, plus club fees for 850 members. (At many courses, non-members can pay well over Pounds 20 a round.) For two similar sites - beside the A27 at Lancing in West Sussex, and at Welton near Lincoln - Clegg Kennedy Drew is waiting for buyers to suggest a price. In Devon, though, a site on the Kingsbridge estuary - now a farm with a five-bedroom house - is on offer through Stags at Pounds 395,000. According to Tom Marriott, of Humberts Leisure, pay-and-play courses and commercial clubs are taking over from the traditional private member clubs. Ten years ago, they made up only 10-20 per cent of all courses; now, Marriott estimates, they total 30-40 per cent. He says most courses appear to be trading reasonably; only a few are put on the market by receivers. If the course operates on a leasehold - as many do - the ground rent and its review date are important factors for potential buyers (Pounds 300-Pounds 400 an acre is the figure now, says Bryant). One working leasehold course, on offer from Humberts or the Glasgow agent Ryden, is Brunston Castle near Turnberry. It was designed by Donald Steel around the Water of Girvan that flows through the middle, with space for houses, chalets and a hotel. Offers of more than Pounds 1m are invited. For Pounds 900,000, Humberts is also selling the Mid-Dorset club in lovely downlands at Blandford Forum (its thatched farmhouse is extra) and (with Strutt &amp; Parker) is asking Pounds 1.75m for Woodbury Park near Exeter, with 27 holes. Designed by Hamilton Stutt, of Turnberry fame, it has been working on a pay-and-play basis and still awaits a proper clubhouse - perhaps even a hotel. So you would like a house adjoining a fairway? One such is Little Mingary, by the 15th at Worplesdon in Surrey (Browns, Pounds 400,000). Then there is Gullane (from Rettie, offers over Pounds 265,000) by the 1st at the famous Muirfield course outside Edinburgh which celebrated its 250th anniversary last weekend. A little further north are an apartment at Gleneagles, site of the recent Scottish Open (Bidwells, Pounds 180,000), and Broomfield, a substantial Edwardian house on Golf Course Road leading to the Rosemount course in Perthshire (Savills in Brechin, offers over Pounds 390,000). Cluttons in Ayr has a few houses well placed for the Turnberry, West Kilbride and Royal Troon courses at prices from Pounds 85,000 to Pounds 250,000 - quite cheap by southern standards. In Surrey, apartments for sale between Pounds 190,000 and Pounds 250,000 on the Pyrford course include lifetime membership of the club; Curchods is the agent. John D. Wood offers two houses in Coombe Park, Kingston upon Thames, beside the Coombe Hill course, for Pounds 535,000 or Pounds 850,000. The ultimate must be a course of your own, as at Sundial House near Farnham, Surrey. Apart from its nine holes, the owners have built a go-kart track in 13.5 acres. Offers over Pounds 800,000 are sought (down from over Pounds 900,000) through Hamptons or Knight Frank &amp; Rutley. Another with its own course is Great Swifts at Cranbrook, Kent, a 1930s' Georgian-style mansion for which Lane Fox set a guide price of Pounds 950,000. Offers came in at more than Pounds 1m. Finally, an agent near Turnberry said this week: 'The whole of south Ayrshire is off on holiday.' That is because householders who are prepared to surrender their four-bedroom homes to Open competitors or fans can demand Pounds 2,000-Pounds 3,000 for a nine-day let. And if the house is really big, they can charge well over Pounds 1,000 a day.

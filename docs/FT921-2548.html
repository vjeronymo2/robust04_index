			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Fed banks see improved economy: Beige Book survey reports little upward pressure on prices MOST Federal Reserve system banks see an improving US economy with little upward pressure on prices, according to the Fed's latest survey of economic conditions, known as the Beige Book, Reuter reports from Washington. 'Most Federal Reserve districts report some improvement in economic conditions,' said the report, prepared by the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. More house building and rising new car and other retail sales were most often mentioned. 'Business sentiment is described as modestly more optimistic in many parts of the country, though it remains cautious,' the survey said. 'There are few indications of significant upward pressure on retail and wholesale prices of goods,' the Fed report said. The Fed reports are issued at roughly six-week intervals. The latest one sets the most optimistic tone since last summer about the economy's prospects. It says manufacturing remains flat with many districts reporting layoffs and rising unemployment. 'Yet several districts report glimmerings of recovery in manufacturing, with improving expectations for future activity.' Bank loan demand 'is best described as flat', though home mortgage lending was often mentioned as a bright spot. 'Mortgage refinancing activity appears to be tapering off somewhat.' Wage and price pressures 'appear generally quite moderate,' the report said, though some mentioned lumber prices were rising because of more building and restricted supplies. Consumers were becoming more active. 'Most Federal Reserve districts report some improvement in retail sales so far and guarded optimism on the part of merchandisers.' New car sales were reported to be rising modestly in Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City and San Francisco. The only district where car sales were falling was Dallas, the Fed said. But prospects for manufacturing industries remain mixed, with New York, Minneapolis and San Francisco Fed banks reporting continuing layoffs and rising unemployment rates. Although, in Philadelphia, Dallas and Richmond, Virginia, there were modest rises in shipments or production rates. Richmond and Kansas City said inventories were still falling, but Cleveland said liquidation may have ended.</p>

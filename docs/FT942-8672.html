			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Pounds 4m Lufthansa/Business Air link Lufthansa, the German carrier, is to inject about Pounds 4m into Business Air of Aberdeen, the Scottish regional airline. The deal will be Lufthansa's first equity participation in a British carrier. Mr Ian Woodley, chairman and co-founder of Business Air, said yesterday that the injection, along with further investment from existing shareholders, would take the company's capital base from Pounds 4m to Pounds 10m. Lufthansa, which will hold up to 38 per cent of the company, signed a marketing co-operation agreement with Business Air last summer in order to develop traffic between the UK and Germany. Business Air's flights from Scotland feed into Manchester, where connections have been timed to catch Lufthansa flights. Business Air - 39 per cent owned by Swiss carrier Crossair - operates five turbo-prop 34 seaters, and a BAe 146, in partnership with Lufthansa, from London City Airport to Frankfurt. The company, which employs 170 people, was founded seven years ago. Last year it flew 140,000 passengers and had turnover of Pounds 20m. Mr Woodley said it had developed as a low-cost quality carrier offering business class service. Lufthansa was making a strategic investment after the success of last year's agreement.</p>

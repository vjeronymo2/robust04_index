			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / International Company News: UBS climbs 10.4% with trading lift UNION Bank of Switzerland, the country's largest, recorded a 10.4 per cent rise in net income last year to SFr1.34bn (Dollars 883m), as sparkling results from trading offset reverses in domestic lending. 'We can claim to be very happy,' Mr Robert Studer, the UBS chief executive, said yesterday, adding that 'we feel quite optimistic about 1993'. He forecast foreign operations would continue to flourish and the bank would overcome its problems in Switzerland. 'All sectors have budgeted for increases in income this year,' Mr Studer said. Return on equity rose from 7 per cent in 1991 to 7.4 per cent last year and the group was 'on track' to reach its target of 10 per cent by the mid-1990s. Foreign operations contributed about a third of group profit last year, up from a quarter in 1991, and the bank, one of the few remaining to enjoy triple A ratings from all leading credit rating agencies, benefited from a large influx of demand and savings deposits. Turmoil in foreign exchange markets in the second half of the year helped trading income soar 32.2 per cent to SFr1.68bn. Net interest income grew 3.6 per cent to SFr3.4bn thanks to improving margins. But provisions for bad loans were raised 6.2 per cent to SFr1.8bn. The directors are proposing to increase dividends from SFr27 to SFr29 per bearer share and from SFr5.40 to SFr5.80 per registered share. Bank Leu, part of the CS Holding group, has reported 1992 net profit of SFr30.7m after liquidating SFr11.1m in hidden reserves, 7.2 per cent lower than the 1991 result.</p>

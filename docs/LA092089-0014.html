			<p><P> September 20, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 64% OF DWP'S CUSTOMERS STEER CLEAR OF TAP WATER  </P> <P> In a stinging vote of no-confidence, nearly two-thirds of Los Angeles  Department of Water and Power customers use bottled water or water filtration  devices instead of drinking straight from the tap, a recent DWP customer survey  found.  </P> <P> A companion survey found that DWP employees are almost as likely as customers  to use bottled or filtered water.  </P> <P> Southern California has long been the country's top bottled water market, but  the findings show more distrust of tap water than previous surveys, apparently  reflecting growing fears of toxic pollution.  </P> <P> Fifty-four percent of the customers who said they used bottled or filtered  water said they did so for better taste, but 40% said they did for safety  reasons.  </P> <P> "Possibly the most distressing result seen in this survey is the fact that  bottled water use is on the rise," the report said. "Both bottled water and  (filtered water) are considered by users to be better tasting and safer than  DWP-supplied water."  </P> <P> DWP officials said they were disturbed but not completely surprised by the  findings, given the intense publicity about toxic hazards.  </P> <P> "We're just fighting an uphill battle to try to get out the correct information  about the water supply," said Dan Waters, DWP assistant general manager for  external and organizational services.  </P> <P> The DWP provides water and electric power to the more than 3.3 million  residents of the city of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The survey showed that fewer customers today believe that Los Angeles water  meets all state and federal standards than in 1987, when the DWP conducted a  similar survey. Sixty-three percent then thought that all standards were being  met, but that number has dwindled to 54%, with 24% now believing that the water  does not meet standards and the rest saying that they are unsure.  </P> <P> The findings also indicated that customers were nearly three times as likely to  believe that contaminated ground water is a problem than to believe that it is  not. Fifty-seven percent said contaminated ground water is a problem and 20%  said it is not.  </P> <P> The president of a bottled water trade group estimated that one of every two  Southern Californians is "into some sort of tap water alternative." Told of the  DWP findings, Douglas Nelson of the International Bottled Water Assn. said they  reflect the "highest incidence in the country" of bottled and filtered water  use.  </P> <P> The customer survey found that 53% use bottled water, paying an average of  $14.40 per month -- or about 800 times more per gallon than DWP water costs.  Nineteen percent used water filters. Because some use both bottled water and  filtration units, the total number who said they rely on alternate drinking  water sources was 64%.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Survey of Employees  </P> <P> Among DWP employees, 59% said they use alternate drinking water sources -- with  49% using bottled water and 18% using home filter units.  </P> <P> The survey included employees living in Los Angeles and served by the DWP and  those living elsewhere and served by different water systems.  </P> <P> But there were no significant differences between employees who were DWP  customers and employees who were not in their use of bottled and filtered  water, the survey found.  </P> <P> Waters said the trend is understandable in light of publicity about toxic  hazards.  </P> <P> "For every person that hears something about the water meeting all the  standards . . . they read eight stories about water-contamination problems  somewhere in the country," Waters said.  </P> <P> Some of that publicity has been about chemical contamination of DWP wells in  the San Fernando Valley that supply about one-sixth of the city's water.  </P> <P> Polluted wells have been idled or are being blended with clean supplies, with  the result that DWP's water meets all state and federal health standards,  according to officials of the California Department of Health Services and the  DWP.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Safety Guarantee  </P> <P> At the same time, health officials and some consumer and environmental groups  say there is no guarantee of greater safety in bottled water.  </P> <P> In a recent report, titled "Bottled Water: Sparkling Hype at a Premium Price,"  the Environmental Policy Institute, based in Washington, attacked the  "unfounded presumption" that bottled water "is invariably preferable to tap  water . . . from a health perspective."  </P> <P> Such critics point out that bottled and public water supplies typically are  drawn from sources that are equally at risk from pollution. Often, bottled  water is tap water that is filtered or treated again.  </P> <P> In 1986, California health authorities and bottled water industry officials  made the surprising discovery that tiny traces of methylene chloride, a  chemical solvent, were leaching into bottled waters from their plastic  containers. The state has since imposed a strict limit on methylene chloride in  bottled water.  </P> <P> Critics also argue that federal regulations do more to assure the purity of  public water supplies than bottled water. That is because the federal Food and  Drug Administration -- which regulates bottled water -- has failed to set  standards for some contaminants that the Environmental Protection Agency has  set limits for in public supplies.  </P> <P> But in California, new state regulations have nearly reversed the situation.  Legislation passed in 1987 requires bottled water -- including imported water  that is distributed in California -- to comply with stiffer standards for some  contaminants than public supplies. The law set lower bottled water limits for  lead, organic solvents and trihalomethanes -- byproducts of water disinfectants  that are suspected of causing cancer.  </P> <P> The DWP employee survey showed that workers are almost as nervous as ordinary  customers about the safety of public water supplies. Asked why a majority of  employees would prefer bottled or filtered water, Waters said the workers are  "pretty much typical citizens of the city of Los Angeles."  </P> <P> In one way, however, the employees are different than other city residents.  They are "less responsible" than regular customers "in the area of  conservation," the employee survey found. Specifically, it said, customers are  more likely than employees to cut their water use in response to DWP's higher  summer rates.  </P> <P> The DWP should try to educate its workers "on the need to set a better  example," Waters said.  </P> <P> The employees also were more convinced than customers that DWP water diversions  from streams feeding Mono Lake are having a negative environmental impact. This  is despite the DWP's unwavering position -- enunciated in litigation and public  statements -- that there is no proof of lasting harm to the lake, whose level  has dropped because its feeder streams are tapped for one-seventh of the city's  water.  </P> <P> Among customers, 32% believe that there is a negative impact on Mono Lake, 13%  believe there is not and 55% are not sure.  </P> <P> But 46% of the employees believe that there is a negative impact on Mono Lake,  compared to 30% who do not and 24% who are unsure. Said Waters: "I don't think  that the bulk of our employees are really aware of all of the facts."  </P> <P> The surveys did contain some good news for the DWP. Although most customers  thought that DWP service was comparable to that of other utilities, 31%  perceived a difference -- and by a 4-1 margin that group said the DWP does a  better job than other utilities.  </P> <P> The surveys were not intended for public release, but were provided in response  to a request from The Times. Waters said the studies, which together cost about  $120,000, were meant to serve as internal guidelines to improve the utility's  service and image.  </P> <P> For the customer survey, 1,001 water users throughout the city were interviewed  last February and March by researchers from Reichman-Karten-Sword Inc. of San  Francisco.  </P> <P> For the employee survey, 1,688 of the DWP's 11,573 employees were interviewed  by the Evaluation and Training Institute of Los Angeles, another research  organization. Waters said there was a 95% certainty that the margin of error  for the two surveys was no greater than 3%.  </P> <P> Last year, California accounted for 35.7% of U.S. bottled water sales,  according to the International Bottled Water Assn. Bottled water has always  sold more briskly in Southern California than elsewhere, due partly to hot  weather, aggressive marketing and objections to the taste of some public water  supplies.  </P> <P> The DWP surveys show that demand for bottled and filtered water is continuing  to grow.  </P> <P> In September, 1986, The Times reported that its own survey had found that four  of 10 Californians and half of Los Angeles County residents were using bottled  or filtered water.  </P> <P> The latest DWP survey also shows that more customers use bottled and filtered  water now than in 1987, when the utility conducted its earlier poll. In the  earlier survey, 47% of customers used bottled water -- compared to 53% now --  and 16% used filtration devices, compared to 19% now.  </P> <P> The impact of bottled water sales on DWP revenue is nil, since drinking water  represents only a fraction of 1% of water consumption.  </P> <P> DWP officials said they will not try to discourage use of alternate supplies by  those who can afford them and prefer the taste.  </P> <P> But they bristled at the thought that people buy bottled water as a necessity  rather than luxury.  </P> <P> If people would "rather be buying shoes for the kids or something, then I think  we have some concerns there," Waters said. "It's really not fair to the people  . . . because a lot of them are spending money to buy water that they really  don't need to."  </P> <P> </P> <P> BOTTLED WATER CONSUMPTION  </P> <P>  This chart shows the per capita consumption of bottled water in selected  states.

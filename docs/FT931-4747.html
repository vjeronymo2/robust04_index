			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Gold seized from offices of Kanemaru A TEAM of investigators yesterday seized 100kg of gold bars from the Tokyo office of Mr Shin Kanemaru, until last year a powerful figure in the Liberal Democratic party (LDP) and the godfather of Japanese politics. The Tokyo prosecutors' office, which is investigating Mr Kanemaru's alleged tax evasion, found gold bars worth about Y1bn (Pounds 5.84m) in the office in Nagatcho, close to the parliament in central Tokyo. As gold can be purchased anonymously, it is alleged that Mr Kanemaru accumulated his holdings to avoid paying income tax. Mr Kanemaru faces allegations that he used some of the political funds he collected for his personal purposes. He and his private secretary were arrested on Saturday over alleged tax evasion between 1987 and 1989 which could amount to more than Y400m. Mr Kanemaru resigned from parliament in October after being fined Y200,000 following his admission that he received an illegal political donation of Y500m from Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin, a scandal-tainted trucking company. During the late 1980s Mr Kanemaru established his position as the most powerful figure within the then Takeshita faction, which dominated the ruling LDP, through his legendary ability to raise money. Estimates of Mr Kanemaru's liquid assets, largely held in forms which do not need to be registered with the authorities, vary. However it is estimated that in addition to the Y1bn in gold bars, he also held between Y2.8bn and Y5bn in discount bank bonds. NHK, the broadcasting corporation, reported that Mr Kanemaru's hidden assets are thought to be worth Y7bn. Discount bonds, which Mr Kanemaru began to buy in 1984, can be purchased anonymously. Opposition party leaders alleged that Mr Kanemaru's decision to keep such large sums in unregistered bonds and gold bars was evidence that he was trying to avoid paying tax. Investigators disclosed that in the days before his arrest Mr Kanemaru's aides, aware that an investigation was under way, moved large quantities of bonds, gold and cash between Mr Kanemaru's house, offices and other locations. Mr Kanemaru and his secretary are due to be charged by March 13 and could remain in custody at the Tokyo detention centre until March 17.</p>

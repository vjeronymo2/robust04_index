			<p><P> August 14, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWS ANALYSIS;  </P> <P> CONFRONTATION WRECKS U.S. EFFORT FOR ISRAEL-PLO TALKS;  </P> <P> PEACE PROCESS: ARAFAT'S SUPPORT OF THE INVASION ADDS STRAIN TO THE TENUOUS  RELATIONSHIP WITH WASHINGTON.  </P> <P> The burgeoning Persian Gulf confrontation has administered the coup de grace to  the Bush Administration's already badly damaged effort to bring about peace  talks between Israel and its Palestinian adversaries.  </P> <P> No matter how the current crisis plays itself out, U.S. Middle East diplomacy  will be changed radically and probably irrevocably. Paradoxically, both Israel  and the Palestine Liberation Organization may emerge as net losers.  </P> <P> "The peace process was dead in the water anyway," said Samuel L. Lewis, former  U.S. ambassador to Israel. "These events really have put a strong period after  the whole (U.S.) effort that has been going on over the last year."  </P> <P> The PLO and its chairman, Yasser Arafat, may have written themselves  permanently out of the diplomatic script by supporting Iraq's invasion of  Kuwait. The PLO was one of only two members of the Arab League that voted  against a resolution last weekend condemning Iraqi aggression.  </P> <P> The sight of Arafat embracing Iraqi President Saddam Hussein must have  gladdened hearts all over Israel because it makes it far more difficult for the  United States to resume its dialogue with the PLO. The talks were broken off  last month after the organization refused to condemn an abortive attack on a  crowded Tel Aviv beach by a PLO splinter group.  </P> <P> But the crisis also will strengthen the bonds between the United States and the  Arab countries standing with it against Iraq. Washington has long maintained  cordial relations with Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Morocco, three moderate Arab  states that have lined up with Washington.  </P> <P> In addition, Syria has announced that it will join the anti-Iraq cause,  possibly improving its long-strained relationship with the United States. Many  Middle East experts believe that the Administration will come under increasing  pressure to provide some subtle rewards to its Arab allies by showing more  sympathy for the Palestinian position.  </P> <P> Most regional experts said that full-scale war is not likely, although it is  difficult to predict the precise course of the crisis. But they said that the  impact on the U.S. approach to the Arab-Israel peace process will be much the  same, no matter what happens, provided there is no war.  </P> <P> "Looked at from the Israeli perspective, the crisis helps Israel in terms of  its security but poses some problems on the diplomatic front," said Geoffrey  Kemp, a National Security Council expert on the Middle East during the Reagan  Administration.  </P> <P> "No matter what happens, it will be much more difficult for Iraq to get the  high technology it needs to produce nuclear weapons and advanced missiles,"  said Kemp, now a senior associate of the Carnegie Endowment for International  Peace. "Even if there is an early and peaceful resolution, there will be a  tightening of the screws" on military and technological assistance to Iraq.  </P> <P> Also, Kemp said, Israel's argument that Arab armies are more dangerous than  Palestinian rock-throwers will take on added credibility.  </P> <P> However, he said that once the gulf confrontation ends, there will be an added  urgency to "get on top of the peace process," something that might require  Israel to take steps that it has long been reluctant to take, such as  face-to-face meetings with Palestinian representatives.  </P> <P> William B. Quandt, the National Security Council's Middle East specialist in  the Carter Administration, said that after the crisis, the Arab regimes that  supported the United States will expect some rewards.  </P> <P> "We will have to do something that gains a bit of credibility with the Arab man  on the street and gives the pro-Western regimes room to maneuver," Quandt said.  "When the dust settles on this, the Palestinian-Israeli issue will still be  there unresolved.  </P> <P> "So far, Bush has incurred no debt whatsoever to Israel," Quandt said. "He has  not talked to (Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak) Shamir, and there has been no  talk of the strategic relationship. Israel seems irrelevant to this crisis. On  the other hand, Bush will be somewhat indebted to some of the Arabs."  </P> <P> At the same time, the crisis has put additional strains on the already bankrupt  relationship between the United States and the PLO. Arafat's support for  Hussein would seem to preclude any resumption of the U.S.-PLO dialogue.  </P> <P> However, some Administration officials are remarkably tolerant of Arafat's  position, describing him as a "weather vane" who embraced the Iraqi leader  because he seemed to be winning and who can be expected to shift his support to  Egypt or Saudi Arabia if the allied position seems to be prevailing.  </P> <P> One senior official said that Washington's conditions for resuming the dialogue  with the PLO are unchanged as a result of the crisis. By condemning the Tel  Aviv raid, the PLO could restore its tattered relationship with the United  States.  </P></p>

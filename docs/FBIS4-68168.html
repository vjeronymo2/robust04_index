			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Ibrahim Humaydi report: "Hamas Demands Its Founder's </F> Release"]    [Excerpts] Damascus -- The Islamic Resistance Movement  (Hamas) has demanded the "immediate" release of Shaykh Ahmad  Yasin, the movement's leader, who has been in the occupation's  jails for five years. It renewed its rejection of the  "undertaking statement" which the occupation forces want the  detainees to sign before they can be released from detention  centers.    A statement issued by Hamas, a copy of which AL-HAYAH's  Damascus bureau has received, says: [passage omitted] "We  condemn the obstruction of his receiving medical treatment and  undergoing surgical operations and the enemy government's  persistence in refusing to allow a national team to supervise  Ahmad Yasin's treatment. We hold the Rabin government  responsible for anything that may happen to him."    The movement renewed its absolute rejection of "the  humiliating document (the undertaking statement) which the enemy  authorities" say must be signed. The movement said that "while  Hamas salutes the steadfastness of Palestine's Shaykh and his  brothers detained in the occupation jails, it stresses that  their detention will lead only to further escalation and  resistance against the occupation."

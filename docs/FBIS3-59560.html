			<p>Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Maciej Kociecki, director, Office of Additional </F> Services at Polish Telecommunications Ltd (S.A. = Ltd)]    [Text]  <H5>  Characteristics of POLPAK Network </H5>   The public teleinformation network "POLPAK" has been built  with equipment of the French firm ALCATEL CIT and is entirely  compatible with the international CCITT X.25, X.75, X.28, X.32  standards.    The POLPAK network consists of 18 exchange offices located  in  Poland's principal cities (Warsaw, Katowice, Krakow, Lublin,  Wroclaw, Poznan, Szczecin, Gdansk, Olsztyn, Bialystok, Biala  Podlaska, Rzeszow, Nowy Sacz, Bielsko, Lodz, Jelenia Gora,  Zielona Gora, Koszalin). The total capacity of this network is  1200 ports. Its management center is located in Warsaw. At this  time the network has 4 analog direct (X.75) links to the U.S.A.  France, Germany, Great Britain respectively and more than 40  tandem links to practically the whole world. Sequential  connections are made in the coordinating channel. Subscribers to  the POLPAK network can be connected to it directly through a  permanent line or remotely through a switched telephone or telex  network. In the case of synchronous direct links (X.25) the  transmission speed is up to 9600 bit/s and in the case of  asynchronous ones (X.28) the transmission speed is 600 bit/s,  1200 bit/s, or 2400 bit/s. Remote subscribers can in the case of  synchronous transmission (X.32) count on a speed of 2400 bit/s,  in the case of asynchronous transmission the speed also being  2400 bit/s.    The transmission speed along international links is now 9600  bit/s, but plans for transmission at a speed of 64 kbit/s have  already been purchased. The throughput capacity of the exchange  offices is 1400 packets per second.    Basic technical parameters of the POLPAK network: standard  packet length - 128 symbols standard frequency of packet receipt  confirmation - every second packet maximum number of closed  groups of users a subscriber can belong to - 3 large selection  of network facilities access by authorization only to  subscribers with necessary identifiers.    As has already been indicated, the POLPAK network covers the  entire country and, through international links with packet  networks in other countries, facilitates data transmission to  and from practically all subscribers to these networks  worldwide. Unlike other telecommunication services, moreover,  the rate for switched virtual connections within the "POLPAK"  network does not depend on the distance between subscribers. The  bill for calls depends on the time of day: It is much smaller  for calls made during night hours and non-business days.  Therefore data transmission is cheaper over a packet network  than over leased or telephone lines, especially when the  distances are longer. The advantages of the "POLPAK" network are:    - certainty of error-free data transmission    - possibility of transmitting data of various lengths and at  various speeds    - possibility of protecting data against unauthorized access  from outside    - availability of network facilities such as closed groups  of  users    - blockage of incoming and outgoing calls    - possibility of reverse charging    - automatic readdressation of calls    - transmission of brief messages (alarms)    - access to network for mobile subscribers    - negotiation of transmission parameters    If very high reliability is required, a subscriber can  become  a multiple one. Such a subscriber is connected to at  least two POLPAK exchange offices. When there is trouble in one  of them, the subscriber can continue making and taking calls.  Using the POLPAK network, the subscriber can thus communicate  with any other subscribers at any time.  <H5>  Outlook for Development of "POLPAK" Network </H5>   Development of the POLPAK packet switching network will be  oriented toward its technical characteristics and availability  of services. Improvement of technical characteristics and  better coverage of Poland's territory will be achieved in  several steps. The first step will be installation of new  exchange offices in cities such as Bydgoszcz, Radom, Kielce, and  Czestochowa. In other cities requiring it (like Warsaw, Gdansk,  or Katowice) growing into larger clusters, there will be  installed X.25 concentrators. The second step will be raising  the speed of digital interoffice or intranetwork transmission  between the POLPAK's principal exchange offices to 64 kb/s.    Toward the end of 1995 there will be started up a digital  skeleton (tandem) network with 2 Mbit/s capability covering  Poland's principal cities and operating by the Frame Relay  protocol. It is to be kept in mind however that, from the user's  point of view, access to the network at the 9.6 kb/s level will  for X.25 subscribers still remain the principal bottle  neck for a rather long time, because of the characteristics  of the existing access network, even though channels with 64  kb/s capacity will be made available to users wherever a city  network is in good technical condition. One way to avoid  problems of the access network will be the planned hand-over by  the Polish Telecommunications Ltd of their VSAT terminals. The  user of such a terminal will be able not only to reach the  POLPAK network, and a maximum speed of 64 kb/s to wit, but also  to build private networks with the aid VSAT facilities.    The only services now provided by the POLPAK network are  "pure" transmission. By the end of 1993, however, Polish  Telecommunications Ltd intends to introduce Electronic Mail  X.400/X.500 accessible (connected) to all network subscribers.  Purchase of a new user-friendly system which will facilitate  cooperation with ISDN network and will include an electronic  document interchange (EDI) module.  <H5>  Cooperation between Electronic Mail and Other Facilities </H5>   Interconnections between packet switching network, telephone  network, telex network, ISDN network through a E-Mail computer.  <H5>  Economics of Data Transmission over POLPAK Network </H5>   Services obtained by use of the POLPAK network subscribers  are billed on a monthly basis.

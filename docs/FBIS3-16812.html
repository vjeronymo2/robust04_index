The  residents are to fill in special questionnaires and have their  passports stamped. The move was made necessary by the refusal  of the Russian military authorities to hand over the militia  registration files. The registration is to concern the Russian  military as well.    The joint Estonian-Russian staff exercise concerned the  evacuation of the nuclear fuel from Paldiski and also studied  the "black scenario" connected with possible escape of  radioactive material. The Estonian side has agreed that 200  additional Russian experts with equipment be allowed to arrive  in case of emergency.</p>

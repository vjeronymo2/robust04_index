			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Sport: Learners and earners - Tennis WITH THE soft spring sunshine bathing the scene once again at Key Biscayne on Thursday, Jim Courier looked pretty relaxed. He had just beaten Mikael Pernfors of Sweden to reach the fourth round of the Lipton tournament. Even though he would have to play a second singles that night (a match he was destined to lose), because of the severe storms in south Florida which had delayed progress at the ten day event, the world No. 1 could afford to smile. The 22-year-old American has already won three tournaments this year and banked Dollars 621,809 (Pounds 438,000) to add to career earnings which had reached almost Dollars 5m by the end of 1992. Just up the coast at Boca Raton, life had a harder edge for four impecunious young Britons. Thursday was the first day of qualifying on the opening leg of the four week Florida Satellite Circuit. For Tim Henman, Nick Gould, Barry Cowan and Dan Sanders this was a life or death mission, a quest for points. Computer points. They alone measure a player's progress. They alone are the passport to a place in the draw and potential prosperity on the whirling multi-million dollar roundabout that is men's professional tennis in 1993. After winning the British Junior Championships last September, Henman's reward was to be part of a British junior squad sent for a four week apprenticeship on the Morocco circuit followed by one week each in Zambia and Botswana plus two weeks in Zimbabwe. That was his first taste of the professional scene. 'I qualified and won two rounds in Morocco to earn my first points - it was an unbelievable feeling.' he remembers. 'People have no idea what it's like at the qualies. The competition is so fierce. After we'd reached the quarter finals of the Sunshine Cup team event last December we went off to spend four weeks on the satellite circuit in Portugal. Every man and his dog showed up that first day - 223 guys signed in. It was a zoo out there. But at least I earned a few points. It was a start.' Sanders has not yet made that start. 'It will be a huge weight off my shoulders when I win my first point' he says. 'There's so much pressure these days, but I don't mind that, now that the LTA are helping me with the cost of competing.' Along with Henman, Gould and Cowan, Sanders is part of a national squad formed last July and managed by LTA coach David Felgate. Sanders, from Yeovil, in Somerset, came to the fore by reaching the semi-finals of the 1991 national Junior Championships in his penultimate year as a junior. Before he earned help from the LTA life was a struggle for his parents. Dan recalls his attempts to follow the path he had chosen: 'They wouldn't let me play tennis at school so I left at 16 and joined John Hicks' squad in Wrexham, playing tennis four days a week and going home at weekends. But each year that cost my dad Pounds 3,000 for just six months and he was also having to pay for my sister at university. Then there was the huge expense of travelling round the tournaments.' Thanks to the efforts of Billy Knight, the former British No. 1 who guides the fortunes of Britain's best youngsters do at last have a realistic chance of making the difficult transition from junior to senior tennis. Not simply because there is financial help available. There is also an improvement in the whole area of development. As Henman says 'There is a much more professional attitude to training, practice and preparation for matches. I have just had a full medical at the Olympic Medical Institute. I realise just how much stronger I need to be and I now have a full training programme to work at.' Henman has no illusions about the task he faces. 'I have to rate myself against people like (Andrei) Medvedev, he's the same age as me and already ranked 21 in the world. . . that's just 759 places higher than I am'. If heredity has any influence, Henman must have a chance. His grandfather, through his mother Jane, was the pre-war British Davis Cup player, Henry Billington. 'I've been playing since mum and dad started me off at the age of two-and-a- half. We were lucky to have a court at home so it was always possible to practise.' When David Lloyd started his Slater Squad some five years ago, based on Reeds School and his Raynes Park club, Henman was in the original intake. Tim says Reeds played an important role in keeping a balance to his life. 'There was nothing special about being a tennis player there. When you went back after practice at the club you simply joined the other kids in normal school activities.' Henman believes the man he must thank for his sound technique is former Davis Cup player Steven Shaw who accompanied James Bailey and Jamie Delgado on their successful trip to Australia in January. Shaw was deputed by David Lloyd to instil a professional attitude in his charges. With healthy competition between the many squads that now exist around UK, both at the centres built as part of the Indoor Tennis Initiative (ITI) and at others in private hands, there are the beginnings of the long-awaited British tennis boom. Much has still to be done. As Davis Cup captain Tony Pickard said this week in Key Biscayne, where he was working as usual with Stefan Edberg, 'We are still not getting the co-operation we need from some of the coaches in coming along with their best youngsters - even though most of them don't have a clue what it takes to exist in this environment.' His arm swept in an expansive arc to embrace this makeshift tennis centre, built on a former rubbish tip, where the world's best men and women, an exclusive band of wealthy athletes, will divide Dollars 3m this week. Perhaps the far away look in his eye is a reflection of how long it will take before Henman and Delgado can expect to amass enough points to join the charmed circle.</p>

			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Court backs Fininvest investigators Investigations by Milan magistrates into the affairs of Mr Silvio Berlusconi's Fininvest empire have resurfaced just as the media magnate begins the final stages of consultations to form a government. Yesterday a civil liberties court approved a request by the Milan public prosecutor for an arrest warrant to be issued against Mr Marcello Dell'Utri, head of Fininvest's advertising arm Publitalia, and two other senior officials in the group on charges of alleged falsifying accounts. Mr Berlusconi immediately described the court's move as a 'huge mistake'. Mr Dell'Utri's lawyers have challenged the decision and the matter now goes to the appeals court. But the incident has underlined that magistrates are still investigating Fininvest, controlled directly by Mr Berlusconi at least until last autumn and whose chairmanship he only relinquished in January. Mr Dell'Utri, a long-time associate of Mr Berlusconi, was the principal figure behind the organisation of the businessman's Forza Italia political movement which relied heavily upon Publitalia's contacts and offices. The charges emerged in March during the election campaign and relate to alleged illicit payments made for transfers of football players to Mr Berlusconi's AC Milan. A lower court rejected the validity of the arrest warrant requests. Yesterday, the civil liberties court claimed there was a risk of evidence being tampered with. It also cited documents sequestered from Mr Salvatore Sciascia, head of Fininvest's central tax department, which showed compromising close links between the latter and a senior official in the finance ministry dealing with tax breaks on pay-TV. The civil liberties court's decision came two days after two Milan magistrates publicly rejected overtures from Mr Berlusconi to join his new government. In particular Mr Berlusconi had been trying to persuade Mr Antonio Di Pietro, the best known of the anti-corruption investigators, to accept the interior ministry, justice ministry or become head of the police. Opinion polls consistently show Mr Di Pietro to be the most popular figure in Italy. But equally Mr Di Pietro, along with his fellow magistrates, possesses the most sensitive and exhaustive information on corruption in Italy. In announcing the refusal to switch to politics, the anti-corruption magistrates reiterated their commitment to pursue investigations. They backed this up by issuing a request to send 37 politicians, businessmen and intermediaries for trial for involvement in the 'mother of all bribes' - the L150bn (Pounds 62m) paid out to permit the Ferruzzi-Montedison group run by the late Raul Gardini to pull out from its Enimont chemicals joint venture with Eni, the state oil concern. The politicians include former Socialist leader Bettino Craxi and Mr Arnaldo Forlani, the former Christian Democrat party secretary, as well as Mr Umberto Bossi, the leader of the Northern League. In a separate move last Friday, Milan magistrates requested that Mr Berlusconi's younger brother be sent for trial for three alleged bribes totalling almost L1bn paid to facilitate property deals with Cariplo, the Milan-based savings bank. One of these payments was allegedly made in 1982, before Mr Berlusconi formally transfered his construction and property interests to his younger brother. All this suggests that, if Mr Berlusconi gains a vote of confidence for his government next week, he will continue to be dogged by investigative problems related to Fininvest. The broader issue of conflict of interest between Fininvest and his role as premier is also far from resolved. Mr Berlusconi said last Thursday he had selected three jurists to act as watchdogs to prevent a conflict of interest and draw up special legislation if necessary. Since then his choice of jurists has been roundly criticised.</p>

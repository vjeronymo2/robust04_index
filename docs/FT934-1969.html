			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Campaign king cashes in his contacts book - Lucy Kellaway meets Des Wilson, champion of causes, who now works for the world's biggest PR company December is shaping up to be a triumphant month for Des Wilson, the irrepressible campaigner. Last week he helped win British shoppers the right to spend their Sundays in the supermarket. This week he launched Richard Branson and Lord Young on their altruistic bid for the National Lottery licence. At his new office at Burson Marsteller, the public relations company, Wilson is very busy, and is running late. His secretary appears, bearing a Des Wilson fact file, containing lists of his campaigning successes, and press cuttings with the most flattering passages highlighted. It appears that, since joining the world's biggest PR company less than a year ago, he has established a thriving a public affairs department with clients including the Training and Enterprise Councils, Mencap, and Investors in People. Wilson is in high spirits. 'I've gone from one success into another,' he says. 'Every agency in London would have liked the lottery business'. He claims that Branson and Young - like nearly all his other clients - were so intent on having Wilson work for them that they did not even ask other agencies to pitch. The man who says this looks a little shambolic. He has twinkling eyes and talks in a flat low voice, a bit like John Major with a New Zealand accent. The combination of unassuming manner and bragging script is effective: you listen to the tales and are inclined to believe them. One of his latest stories is how the joint founder of Shelter, the charity for the homeless, and the ex-chairman of Friends of the Earth, came to be working for Burson Marsteller. 'I always said that when I reached 50 I would move into the private sector. I had no pension and no savings and I had reached the end of the road. You can't go on raising one cause after another.' He was just ready to move two years ago when he was invited to lead the Liberal Democrat election campaign. 'It was like an athlete who thought he was at the end of his career being approached by the Olympic committee,' is how he puts it. He took the job, declined payment, writing a couple of novels and doing a bit of consultancy on the side to fund his nomadic existance in London hotels. The campaign may have lost him the support of those Liberal Democrats who felt his ego had got in the way of their own, but it won him an award from the magazine PR Week for his 'outstanding individual contribution' to the industry. It was when he picked up the prize at a black tie dinner last year that he hatched the novel plan to auction his services. The following day he called the bosses of the six biggest PR agencies. All agreed to see him, and all, he says, expressed interest in his plan. In selecting his future employer, Wilson says he took four things into account: pay, a seat on the board, interesting clients, and a clause stating that he could turn down any work that clashed with his campaigning past. The last clause was a typical piece of Wilson media manipulation. He knew that any employer would allow him to refuse accounts on ethical grounds, yet he wanted the clause for his own personal PR. 'All the newspapers referred to it,' he says. Burson Marsteller scored on all four counts, offering a salary which he says makes him 'one of the highest paid public affairs consultants in London'. Des Wilson is in no doubt that he deserves it. 'I am selling 25 years of making the political system produce the desired result. 'I also have an exceptional range of contacts. The reporters I knew when I started at Shelter in 1966 are now editors. The back benchers are now ministers. The people I knew in TV are now director generals. I know them all.' He describes himself as an 'advocate in the court of public opinion', and, on his own admission, works best when the case is a clear one. On Sunday shopping he realised that the most important thing was to get consumers to write to their MPs, and get store managers to persuade MPs to come and see for themselves. He composed much of the advertising copy himself, unmoved by the apoplectic reaction of the advertising agency. For the National Lottery, he argues, the first task is to make the bid look credible. So there will be no razzmatazz: this week's press conference was a simple affair held round Richard Branson's hearth. 'The usual flamboyancy attached to Richard's or my own campaigns will be lacking,' he says. Amid all these triumphs, has anything he has ever worked on gone badly? He shakes his head and looks apologetic. 'Sorry,' he says. The growing client list is not merely the result of Wilson's skills and his 90-hour-plus working week. The market for public affairs is growing, and an increasing number of ex-politicians are finding a good living to be made there. Yet Wilson claims he is feeling no chill wind of competition; instead he is hatching some fancy plans for the future. This New Zealander would like to sell a new idea of Britain, and make the country great again in the eyes of the world. Needless to say, he believes he is just the man for the job.</p>

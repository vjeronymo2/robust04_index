			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE OBMUDSMAN OF CHINA;  </P> <P> A HIGHER KIND OF LOYALTY BY LIU BINYAN (PANTHEON BOOKS: $22.95; 304 PP.)  </P> <P> "Whenever he writes something, chaos ensues." The complaint is registered by a  distressed bureaucrat who has fallen victim to the expose journalism of China's  most widely read and respected author, Liu Binyan.  </P> <P> Liu, presently in exile in the West, has been an "investigative reporter" in a  country where that phrase is close to an oxymoron. In the People's Republic of  China, journalists know that the word propaganda has no negative connotation,  at least not in officialdom. Censorship is taken for granted. "The press should  unconditionally propagate the party line and policy and should perform the role  of the prty's spokesmen," central committee directives unblushingly dictate.  </P> <P> When Fox Butterfield went to Beijing as correspondent for the New York Times in  1979, the Chinese were baffled to find that he had a room in the Peking Hotel.  "Why don't you live in the American Embassy?" they asked him, unwilling to  believe that the New York Times was not part of the American government.  </P> <P> Not surprisingly, Chinese newspapers lack credibility. In a survey taken by one  newspaper -- published in the relatively open atmosphere of the mid-'80s --  readers agreed almost unanimously that the most useful information in the print  media was the weather forecast. About 10 years ago, the nation's editors  addressed the public's complaints of distrust of, and near-terminal boredom  with, the daily fare of happy news about soybean crops and socialist rectitude.  </P> <P> The result was a flurry of stories highlighting strange phenomena, articles  that were designed to please readers without offending censors. There were  reports of a mermaid, of Chinese children who could read with their armpits,  and of tall, hairy primates who built campfires and knew how to weave bamboo.  </P> <P> More important, a genre of writing known as "literary reportage" (baogao  wenxue) was inaugurated. And with the blessing of the party a small coterie of  muckraking reporters was commissioned to uncover corruption in high places. It  was here, beginning in 1979, that Liu Binyan was to make his mark as a writer  for the People's Daily, the nation's and the party's flagship newspaper and his  entree to institutions everywhere.  </P> <P> It is not so strange that the party would encourage tough investigative  reporting. In addition to revitalizing popular interest in the official press,  it would demonstrate that the leadership cared. In 1979, Deng Xiaoping  possessed only a shaky control over a bureaucracy that was still riddled with  Maoist ideologues and other holdovers of the Cultural Revolution era. Deng's  new power base would be strengthened in direct proportion to the unmasking of  these retrograde elements. Naturally, however, exposing shortcomings in the  system must not be confused with criticizing the system itself.  </P> <P> But who could be more reliable than Liu Binyan? Liu was at once an ardent party  man and a long-suffering victim of Maoist excesses.  </P> <P> Born in 1925, Liu was still a teen-ager when he began printing and distributing  anti-Japanese leaflets in occupied China. At 20, he was accepted into the  party, where his writing talents were soon recognized.  </P> <P> In 1955, at age 30, he was attacked for the first time by the literary  watchdogs of the party. He survived, but in 1957, during Mao's "Hundred  Flowers" campaign, launched to encourage greater freedom of expression, Liu's  writings were found to "exaggerate" the party's defects. He had gone too far,  crossed the line and produced "poisonous weeds" instead of flowers.  </P> <P> Labeled a rightist counterrevolutionary and expelled from the party, Liu  entered a 22-year period of internal exile and forced labor. "I had been at the  height of popularity, considered a 'vanguard' of our age," he writes. And then,  "overnight, I became the detested 'enemy of the people.' "  </P> <P> From 32 years old until 54, he was not allowed to write. Compared to those who  were tortured or sentenced to long jail terms or hounded to death, "I was  lucky," he says. Still, there was tedious and exhausting manual labor, dragging  660-pound night-soil carts from city to countryside. And there was the endless  humiliation of self-criticism sessions, and separation from his wife and  children.  </P> <P> Like many other intellectuals, Liu was rehabilitated, returned to his  profession and to the good graces of the party after Deng Xiaoping's rise to  power. The lost decades of his life did not jar his faith in Marxist ideals,  and in 1979, Liu was once again championing the cause of the wronged and  helpless.  </P> <P> His "People or Monsters?" which appeared in the September, 1979, issue of  People's Literature documented the corrupt machinations of party cadres in  Binxian County near Harbin in the northeast. "The party controls everything;  the only thing it does not control is itself," Liu wrote.  </P> <P> The article brought down a squalid dynasty of local power holders who had been  immune from criticism for 34 years. Reprinted and broadcast on the radio  throughout the country, Liu's story created a sensation. Letters poured into  his office saying, "You write about Binxian, but the same thing is happening  right here where we are!"  </P> <P> Throughout the early 1980s, Liu became a kind of one-man journalistic ombudsman  settling scores for victims of the system. Long lines of petitioners crowded  the entrance to greet him at the People's Daily each morning, and besieged his  apartment in the evening. Approximately half of "A Higher Kind of Loyalty" is a  riveting case-by-case narrative of Liu's investigations of the petty and  not-so-petty tyrants, profiteers, embezzlers, confidence men and zealots, who  represent the seamy side of China's socialist elite.  </P> <P> Some of the cases involve bureaucratic venality that gives extended meaning to  Orwell's "1984." When a corrupt band of provincial party leaders could not  silence the criticisms of a certain Wang Fumian, and could not make criminal  charges against him stick, they had him put away in a mental institution for  life. Liu interviewed Wang, found him both sane and logical, and discovered  that he had been diagnosed as suffering from "mania" by a panel of physicians  led by a veterinarian turned psychiatrist.  </P> <P> Incredibly, it was the provincial Security Bureau that provided guidelines for  the medical board. In its "Criteria for Diagnosing Mental Diseases," mania was  defined as a "rare kind of mental disease." Its symptoms: "overconfidence,  extreme willfulness, found mostly in people of advanced cultural background. .  . . Taken for normal at an early age, the patient gradually asserts his (her)  willpower more and more forcibly, (and) he (she) rushes about offering  petitions, writing endless letters of accusation." This is the exact language  that the party had used for years to condemn anyone with "independent  thinking," Liu notes.  </P> <P> But, as the author observes, the political climate of China is uncertain --  "sunshine one day, rain the next" -- and Liu's career seems to be an all too  reliable barometer of the changing weather. In 1987, Liu was again accused of  going too far, or promoting chaos. More specifically, hard-line party officials  charged him with helping to inspire student protests.  </P> <P> Once again, he was dismissed from the Party. This time, the results were not  personally so destructive to Liu. When Harvard University offered him a Nieman  fellowship in 1988, Liu was able to accept it -- "thanks to the persuasiveness  of Harrison Salisbury" is all that he says by way of explanation.  </P> <P> Nearly every page of this moving book expresses the moral fervor of Liu Binyan  and the gradual erosion of "one kind of loyalty" that had been misplaced in his  youth. "My generation has thrown itself into the struggle led by the Communist  Party," Liu concludes, "in the hope that our children will lead a better life,  and now it is precisely the best and brightest of their generation who had died  at the butcher's hands, or are fugitives fleeing from arrest."  </P></p>

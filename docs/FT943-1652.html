			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Clinton renews sanctions threat President Clinton yesterday warned Japanese Foreign Minister Yohei Kono that unless agreement was reached by September 30 on opening up the Japanese market he would have to resort to sanctions. At the same time US and Japanese negotiators headed into the last lap on talks covering procurement of telecommunications and medical equipment, insurance, glass, vehicles and vehicle components. Agreement is reportedly close on insurance and procurement; reports of at least a partial deal in the making have begun to emerge. This would not preclude sanctions for the remaining issues, particularly the car sector which is responsible for a the greatest share of the Dollars 60bn trade deficit and on which agreement seems most unlikely. President Clinton and his advisers met recently to consider potential sanctions if no agreement is reached. With the president still to prove he can be as tough as his predecessors in military and trade confrontations, threats of sanctions have a ring of authenticity. Around Washington, administration officials had a consistent hard line message. Mr Lawrence Summers, treasury undersecretary for international affairs, said the 'turn-the-other-cheek' approach, demonstrated by the US after the second world war, is no longer acceptable. 'It is absolutely critical that the US be prepared to combat egregious trade practices in Japan or any other country,' he said. Mr Ron Brown, US commerce secretary, said: 'It would be irresponsible for any administration to sit on its hands and do nothing in the face of those facts.' Administration trade adviser Clyde Prestowitz yesterday released a report calling for use of 'legal remedies available under US trade law'. Mr Prestowitz called for a programme to monitor price data in Japan and a task force to advise the president and Congress on 'the feasibility of utilising multilateral processes,' bilateral remedies or whether additional remedies are needed.</p>

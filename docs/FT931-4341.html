			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Cost cutting helps GKN rise to Pounds 122m  -Automotive and engineered products assumed growing importance for the group STRINGENT cost-cutting helped GKN, the motor components and industrial services group, increase pre-tax profits by 77 per cent, from Pounds 68.7m to Pounds 121.8m, in the year to end-December. The improvement was made on turnover only 3.8 per cent higher, at Pounds 2.53bn from Pounds 2.43bn. The profits rise is pared to 23 per cent on a pre-FRS 3 basis, reflecting much larger below-the-line losses incurred in 1991 on the sale or closure of businesses. Nevertheless, Sir David Lees, chairman and chief executive, was able to present a picture of improving prospects for the group in the UK and North America, coupled with a caution about deteriorating markets in continental Europe. The net effect, said Sir David, is that any financial progress GKN makes this year will once again depend mainly on the group's ability to make further progress on cost-cutting and productivity. The group is setting aside Pounds 10m for further restructuring compared with a higher-than-expected Pounds 13m last year. A maintained final dividend of 12.5p makes an unchanged total of 20.5p compared with earnings per share of 18.6p (4.1p). With GKN's industrial services and distribution businesses being hit by a variety of recession-related problems, automotive and engineered products last year assumed growing importance for the group. They accounted for Pounds 1.52bn, or 76 per cent, of turnover, up from Pounds 1.41bn previously, with trading profit rising from Pounds 60m to Pounds 95m. In contrast turnover on industrial services and distribution fell to Pounds 471m from Pounds 512m, and trading profit to Pounds 31m from Pounds 35m. The group's share of sales by associated companies, at Pounds 532,8m, was Pounds 25.9m above 1991, but the share of profits down marginally at Pounds 24.2m (Pounds 28.5m), largely as a result of a Pounds 3m loss at UES Holdings. Further progress on reducing debt has cut gearing to 23.3 per cent from 26.4 per cent, said Sir David. However GKN's tax bill rose sharply, from Pounds 41.3m to Pounds 56.8m, prompting Sir David to call for legislative changes to reduce the burden of unrelieved Advance Corporation Tax. He protested that ACT now accounted for 12 percentage points of the tax charge. COMMENT GKN has won considerable credit for the way it has managed recession so far. However, the restatement of last year's figures under FRS 3 show just how much pain it took in 1991 when pre-tax profit fell to a third of 1989's Pounds 206m peak. It is worth emphasising the 'so far' because European car sales are expected to fall by 1m this year from last year's 13.4m total. Fears are commonly expressed about the potential for severe competition, particularly from German suppliers. While US recovery should provide a cushion, the speed with which manufacturers have increased output ahead of actual sales suggests there could be some hiccups. Whatever the quibbling over market prospects and over the quality of some of GKN's non-auto earnings, you have to admire the cash management. Net debt has virtually halved since December 1989. This has been achieved without a rights issue, whereas T&amp;N has had two. This year a pre-tax profits forecast of Pounds 150m gives a prospective p/e of 19 on yesterday's 485p close. After rising by nearly 50 per cent in six months, the price derives some support from the 5.6 per cent yield.</p>

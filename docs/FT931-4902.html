			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Snub to the establishment: The message of protest from voters in the German state of Hesse Mr Bjorn Engholm, the pipe-smoking intellectual who heads Germany's opposition Social Democrats, is prone at the best of times to more than a touch of pessimism. Yesterday he had good reason to be miserable. His party, which should be riding high in popular esteem, as the ruling coalition, headed by Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats, totters into a deepening economic recession, had just received a terrible snub from the voters of the prosperous west German state of Hesse. And it looked as if the prime beneficiaries were the far-right, racist Republicans, a party of neo-Nazi inclinations which has so far remained just on the right side of the law. In local elections for all the city, town and local authorities of the state, including the gleaming business and banking centre of Frankfurt, the SPD suffered an 8.4 per cent slump in its vote, down from 44.8 to 36.4 per cent since the last local poll in 1989. Mr Kohl's Christian Democrats did little better: from a disastrous low of 34.3 per cent back in 1989, the party lost a further 2.3 per cent. As for the Free Democrats, the junior partner in the Bonn government, they only managed a paltry 5.1 per cent of the votes. It was a resounding snub for the entire political establishment in Bonn. And yesterday it unleashed a predictable round of soul-searching and bickering. The winners were all on the extremes: not merely the far-right Republicans; also the left-wing, environmentalist Greens; and the biggest party of all, the non-voters. The Republicans, who only stood in two small council districts at the last elections in 1989, managed to grab 8.3 per cent of the poll overall. In Frankfurt city, with the largest immigrant population in the country (roughly 26 per cent), they won 9.5 per cent of the votes, and in one of the most depressed inner-city areas, no less than 14 per cent. As for the Greens, the minority partner in the Hesse government with the SPD, they also benefited significantly from the mood of disillusionment with the political establishment, pushing up their share of the vote from 9.1 to 11 per cent. The turnout was down by 6.7 per cent, from 78 to 71.3 per cent: a result which would have delighted local election officials in other European countries, but which is regarded with gloom in Germany. The same mood of despair has been true across the political spectrum of political comment, with the notable exception of the unflappable Chancellor Kohl. Mr Engholm was in little doubt about the meaning of the vote: 'This result is an expression of a deep crisis of confidence towards the two great popular parties,' he said, referring to his own SPD and Mr Kohl's CDU. 'We must ask what future, and in what circumstances, the two big parties will have.' He even went so far as to express concern - 'not a little concern, but great concern' - over the stability of the German democratic state. Across the road at the CDU headquarters, the chancellor was more sanguine. He reminded his audience that they had all cried doom in 1989, and yet he had come back to win the unification election in 1990. And he restated his absolute conviction that the far-right Republicans will not win a single seat in the German Bundestag when it comes to the national elections next year. Given the international reaction of horror to the slightest hint of a revival of nationalism and neo-Nazism, as well as the domestic soul-searching, how can Mr Kohl be so cool? He may be wrong, but there are indications that the right-wing revival has peaked. In neighbouring Baden-Wurttemberg last April, the Republicans shocked the establishment by polling no less than 10.9 per cent across the state. They might have been expected to do even better in Frankfurt with its high immigrant population. The National-Democratic party (NPD), the Republicans' predecessor as standard-bearer of the far right, already polled 6.6 per cent in Frankfurt in 1989, before the latest wave of immigration was under way. Today the NPD has faded to an insignificant rump. The Republicans themselves have seen their support drop sharply in the past three months, as tens of thousands of Germans have demonstrated against attacks on foreigners. The fear of the political establishment with regard to the Republicans, headed by Mr Franz Schonhuber, a former SS officer, is that they may succeed in making themselves salonfahig or, roughly translated, 'house-trained'. Then it may become acceptable for more disgruntled electors to vote for them. In the meantime, however, they are a symptom of protest against the creaking consensus politics of Bonn, against rising unemployment, the inadequacy of housing, and the pressures of immigration on west Germany's prosperous lifestyle. They are not yet a coherent political movement.</p>

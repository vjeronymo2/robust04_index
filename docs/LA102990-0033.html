			<p><P> October 29, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BILLS GO TO WORK EARLY IN A 27-10 VICTORY;  </P> <P> AFC: AFTER THREE GAMES OF HAVING TO RALLY FOR VICTORIES, BUFFALO SHUTS DOWN  PATRIOTS QUICKLY BY BUILDING A 24-POINT LEAD.  </P> <P> Buffalo didn't need any miracles against the New England Patriots.  </P> <P> The Bills, who won their previous three games with improbable fourth-quarter  comebacks, were cruising by that time Sunday to a 27-10 victory over the  Patriots.  </P> <P> "We had to come from behind even though we played well (in the last three  games)," Buffalo Coach Marv Levy said. "We knew we had to get off to a good  start (against New England.)"  </P> <P> Don Smith scored on a one-yard run to give the Bills a 7-0 lead on their first  possession. Thurman Thomas, who rushed for 136 yards, scored on a three-yard  run midway through the second quarter and Buffalo (6-1) had a 14-3 lead at  halftime.  </P> <P> The Bills put the game away by scoring on three consecutive possessions in the  third quarter to make it 27-3.  </P> <P> The Patriots (1-6) have lost their last five games and are off to their worst  start since 1970.  </P> <P> "It serves no purpose (to discuss the poor start)," New England rookie Coach  Rod Rust said. "(The Bills) did what they wanted to better than we did what we  wanted to."  </P> <P> For the first time in six games, the Bills never trailed. They outgained the  Patriots, 353 yards to 262.  </P> <P> The memory of last year's 33-24 loss in which a poor Patriots' team scored 20  points in the last nine minutes at Foxboro spurred the Bills.  </P> <P> "This team was very aware that last year's game slipped away," Levy said.  "We're not taking anything for granted."  </P> <P> Jason Staurovsky's 32-yard field goal 12 seconds before intermission cut the  lead to 14-3, but the Patriots didn't score again until they trailed by 24  points.  </P> <P> "We're asking too much of the defense," New England tackle Bruce Armstrong  said. "We're asking them to stop the other team time and time again and that's  not fair."  </P> <P> Thomas, who missed most of a 30-27 victory over the New York Jets last week  with a right knee injury, returned to the lineup and picked right up where he  left off.  </P> <P> "Thomas had a very good game," said quarterback Jim Kelly, who completed 14 of  20 passes for 208 yards and a touchdown. "The offensive line gave me time to  throw."  </P> <P> Leading, 14-3, the Bills punted on their first possession of the third quarter,  then scored on two 35-yard field goals by Scott Norwood and a 20-yard pass from  Kelly to Keith McKeller.  </P> <P> The Patriots made it six consecutive games with just one offensive touchdown  when quarterback Steve Grogan, who missed the previous four games with a neck  injury, threw a 19-yard scoring pass to Sammy Martin with 3:19 gone in the  fourth quarter.  </P> <P> For the fourth time in five games, a New England opponent scored on its first  possession when Kelly led the Bills on a 12-play, 68-yard drive lasting 7:08.  Kelly completed all five of his passes for 60 yards, with Smith's touchdown  capping the drive.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 15, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ENTERTAINMENT;  </P> <P> STING'S 'THREEPENNY OPERA': A 'DUD'  </P> <P> Rock star Sting suffered the slings and arrows of outraged theater critics  today for his stage debut in "The Threepenny Opera," but he was a smash hit  with Soviet Ambassador Yuri Dubinin and Yulia Sukhanova, the Soviet Union's  first beauty queen.  </P> <P> With President and Mrs. Bush watching from box seats above the National Theater  stage Thursday night, Sting made the best of a daunting, three-hour performance  as Mack the Knife in the pre-Broadway premiere of Bertolt Brecht's biting  musical satire.  </P> <P> The critics, however, agreed that Sting's best wasn't good enough.  </P> <P> "Slow and turgid stuff," complained the Washington Post's David Richards, who  said Sting's "acting has little resonance and his singing voice is surprisingly  thin."  </P> <P> "If you're going to see Sting, prepare to be stung," said Hap Erstein of The  Washington Times, who said this "Threepenny Opera" proved "to not be worth 2  cents."  </P></p>

He said:  Talks with President Bill Clinton were the most important stage  of the visit and determined the prospects for the development of  bilateral relations. An accord has been reached to take  additional practical steps in order to promote these relations  in many spheres. Signing of the charter on democratic  partnership between Kazakhstan and the United States means a new  stage of cooperation aimed at ensuring peace and stability in  the entire Central Asian region. As the result of the talks, a  number of other documents have been signed which regulate  contacts in the fields of science, technology, defense and  military relations, and nuclear safety, and open up broad access  for foreign investment in the economy of our country.    Nursultan Nazarbayev answered numerous questions from  journalists. He stressed that in new Kazakh-U.S. relations, not  a single step has been taken that contradicts previous  agreements between the CIS states.    This is what the president said when answering a question on  what the United States will get from economic cooperation with  Kazakhstan:    [Begin Nazarbayev recording] I tell you again -- I have been  saying this for three years -- nobody in the world, not a single  businessman, not a single billionaire, will give a cent to  anyone for nothing, besides, of course technical help,  educational help, international funds, humanitarian aid and so  on. Any person will come here only if he will earn more than he  is earning in America. Is this [words indistinct] in the  transition period we have to create favorable conditions for  them so that they will come here. We will have to lose  something in order to gain something. Some people in our  country sometimes say that we are selling these resources and so  on and so forth -- every state sells what it has. Kuwait is  selling its oil and living normally, developing production.  Saudi Arabia is selling its oil and living normally. Iran and  Iraq are selling their oil and living normally. What we are  planning now is for 100 years to come. I hope that in 50 years  mankind will find a source of energy that will not pollute the  streets with gasoline and [words indistinct]. Japanese cars are  using batteries already. That is why it is not right to say  that we have to save all these minerals. Who will need them?  We must sell what is sellable now in order to get currency and  to develop Kazakhstan, to build up living standards for all our  citizens. That is what we must do. [end recording]</p>

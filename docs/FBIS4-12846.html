			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 13 Apr (INA)--Oil Minister Dr. Safa' Hadi  Jawad has said that Iraq is making preparations to sign new oil  deals with several European firms next month.    In a statement to the newspaper AL-JUMHURIYAH published here  today, Jawad added that the cooperation talks between Iraq and  European oil corporations have reached an advanced stage, noting  that preparations are currently under way for signing several  contracts with these firms after the recent conclusion of  cooperation agreements with French oil firms.    The minister addressed the issue of oil cooperation between  Iraq and Turkey, saying that the Turkish side has demonstrated  an urgent desire to reopen the Iraqi oil pipeline across Turkey,  particularly since the latter is suffering from an unemployment  that is having political and economic effects.    The minister asserted that the oil pipeline that runs across  Turkish territory is ready for operation once the Iraq sanctions  are lifted.</p>

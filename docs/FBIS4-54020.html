			<p>CSO     [Text] The Telecommunications Council, a Ministry of  Posts and Telecommunications [MOPT] advisory organ, published a  draft report on 12 May which will serve as the guide for  establishment of an advanced information society and envisions  "optical fiber cable to homes" by 2010 with an optical fiber  network which encompasses households on a nationwide basis. The  concept can be considered as Japan's version of Vice President  Gore's "information superhighway concept," but there are many  problems to be resolved when one considers the details of how  and who will raise the necessary capital. The issues will  certainly inspire renewed future debate together with arguments  in favor of breaking up Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT)  which is considered too powerful.    The draft report published by the Telecommunications Council  on 12 May reflects the strong desire of the MOPT to build a  next-generation communications network and reflects ambitious  goals which call for both the government and private sector to  take more extensive actions than ever envisioned in the past.    However, as the report indicates, installation of the  optical  fiber cable network alone will require a vast investment of  33-53 trillion yen by 2010. The critical business organization  to handle the installation work itself remains to be  established. The reality is that many hurdles must be overcome  in implementing the project.    The initial passage of the introductory paragraph of the  draft report states, "Japan now stands at a crucial crossroads."  These words reflect a sense of crisis wherein strong concern is  being expressed about the reversal of Japanese-U.S.  competitiveness in the high-tech arena and the potential that  Japan will be outdistanced by the rest of the world in the  communications sector. The report is configured so that it  reflects strong awareness of action being taken in the United  States, such as the installation of optical fiber networks  encompassing schools and hospitals by 2000.    Chapter 4 of the report comments, "We observe more than just  a few cases where so-called new media didn't succeed in the  past." Officials of the MOPT Communications Policy Bureau state,  "Wording like this is unprecedented and merely provides a strong  indication of the lessons we learned from experience with past  projects." Put another way, those words merely reflect an honest  acknowledgment of past failures of "teletopia ideas" and a  determination to create a visionary but practical concept for  the future.    Actually, the Telecommunications Council has held over 30  subcommittee meetings during the past 14 months. MOPT councils  normally operate for two to three months and meet only three or  four times, but the duration and frequency of Telecommunications  Council subcommittee sessions were of an unprecedented magnitude.    On 11 May, the day before the draft report was submitted to  the Telecommunications Council for review on the 12th, more than  20 representatives of the financial world gathered secretly at  an MOPT facility in Tokyo. The group included adviser Yoshihisa  Tabuchi of Nomura Securities and director and advisor Osamu  Sakurai of Sumitomo Trust and Banking Co.. The gathering marked  the launching of the "Communications Business Policy Council"  (chaired by Chairman Sho Nasu, Tokyo Electric Power Company),  whose members come primarily from the private sector and which  is attended by the directors of the Communications Policy,  Teleommunications, and Broadcast Bureaus of the MOPT as  observers.    It is a fact that the business world has strong expectations  for the growth of the information sector and that the draft  report takes the position that the private sector will play a  principal role in the construction of the information  infrastructure, amidst an absence of signs of a full-scale  economic recovery.    However, on the other hand, the MOPT embraces the strong  hope  that the momentum inspired by emerging movements of the above  nature will serve to favorably influence funding decisions.  Speaking of MOPT budgets, major budget categories such as  postal, postal savings, and simplified insurance are covered by  special accounts. The initial fiscal year 1994 budget for MOPT  public works projects provided only 5.3 billion yen. The reason  is that the MOPT had a burning desire to acquire general  accounts budget funding for the information-communications  sector.    However, even some sources at MOPT express fear that the  "required funding estimates" found in the draft report "are not  based on sound data." Basically, the Ministry of Finance [MOF]  is negative on the use of fiscal funds for construction of  communications infrastructure because such funding would be  inconsistent with the privatization of NTT and some sources  express the opinion that, if conditions remain unchanged, an MOF  which faces difficulties with tax revenues is unlikely to  increase budgets for sectors that lack any meaningful  performance record.    Now that the draft report has been published, attention will  be focused on how competition will be encouraged among  businesses in the installation of optical fiber cable networks.  Pending resumption of debate on the break up of NTT some time  next year, the draft report strongly launches the idea of "fair  competition." The idea seems to reflect the goal of restraining  NTT, which launches business operations on an overwhelming scale.    The draft report shows strong signs of competing with the  U.S. "information superhighway idea." A look at the schedule in  which Japan is to complete installation of optical fiber  networks by 2010 shows that Japan will be progressing on a  shoulder-to-shoulder basis with the United States.    To begin with, the question is why has Japan fallen behind  the United States. The MOPT and the communications industry  state that the reason rests with the fact that Japan sits far  behind the United States in terms of personal computer  installations, cable television [CATV] subscribers, and cellular  telephone hookups. They attribute the creation of an information  boom based on the Gore concept to the maturity of the U.S.  computer software industry.    As a practical matter, it was the CATV companies in the  United States which took the initiative in providing two-way  communication services in response to the Gore concept. Further,  Internet, which is a grassroots network, is drawing much  attention now as a principal role player among next-generation  communications networks.    Private-sector business logic would seem to dictate that if  "actual demand" does not exist in Japanese markets, it would be  advisable to delay investments in optical fiber cable networks,  but the draft report for whatever reason places emphasis on  completing such investments simultaneously with the United  States. Although the draft report speaks of the user being the  primary driving force, it persists in the concept of placing  supply before demand.    On the other hand, the draft report stresses private-sector  competition, but in Japan the situation is such that NTT could  well become the sole winning player with a predominant role,  compared to the United States where CATV firms have grown to  levels equalling communications firms and actively engage in  competition and business affiliations. Although the report  speaks of competition under such circumstances, it lacks in  providing a real sense of competition.    In the final analysis, the MOPT will probably endeavor to  maintain a competitive market by assisting in the development of  a force to counter NTT in the form of CATV and newly formed  electric power company-affiliated telephone companies. MOPT in  December 1993 launched a plan to promote CATV participation in  the communications sector. At one time, the MOPT extended lower  priority to new electric power company-affiliated telephone  companies because they came under the jurisdiction of the  Ministry of International Trade and Industry, but they have no  choice now but to nurture organizations of that nature. Fiscal  year 1995 will see a rekindling of the debate on a split-up of  NTT. The draft report which calls for fair competition among  various businesses could potentially induce a renewed call for  breaking up NTT.</p>

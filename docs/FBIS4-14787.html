			<p>BFN     [Text] Tallinn, 1 April -- A soldier of the Russian Border  Troops was killed on Friday [1 April] morning on Estonia's  border with Pskov Oblast.    As BNS has learned at the Estonian Border Guard Information  Department, on 1 April around 0400, three soldiers of the  Russian Border Troops detained two unidentified individuals.  During an identity control, one of the detained individuals  pulled out a gun and opened fire on the soldiers, killing one of  them and wounding two others. Following this, the unknown  individuals escaped.    The Russian Border Troops put all its reserves on alert, and  are currently searching for the criminals. Also participating  in the search are local units of the Interior Ministry Troops,  the Militia, and the Counterintelligence Service.    On Friday, Estonian Ambassador to Moscow Juri Khan was  summoned to the Russian Interior Ministry, where he was given an  appeal to the Estonian law enforcement authorities to render  help in searching for the criminals. According to Khan, the  Russian side believes that the suspects can be hiding on  Estonian territory.    Khan has told BNS that the conversation at the Russian  Interior Ministry was very "friendly," and that he was assured  that the Russian side does not regard the accident as a  provocation. According to Khan, the Russian leadership does not  have any doubts that the incident was of a criminal nature.  Khan also reported that, according to the Russian side, the  criminals spoke Russian without a foreign accent.    The press bureau of the Russian Border Troops has neither  confirmed, nor denied the report that the criminals spoke fluent  Russian, or that they hid on Estonian territory. A press bureau  official has also said that the Russian side regards the  incident as a criminal offense.    The duty officer at the Pskov Border Troops Unit has refused  to reveal to BNS any information about the incident, explaining  that everybody is busy searching for the criminals.</p>

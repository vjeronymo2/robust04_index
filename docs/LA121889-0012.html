			<p><P> December 18, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 49ERS BENEFIT FROM BILLS' GIVEAWAY  </P> <P> Once again, the Buffalo Bills have gone ice-cold in December.  </P> <P> Handed two big opportunities Sunday -- Miami's loss to Indianapolis and San  Francisco's decision to rest quarterback Joe Montana's injured ribs -- the  Bills bobbled away five second-half turnovers and lost to the 49ers, 21-10.  </P> <P> Roger Craig rushed for 105 yards and the go-ahead touchdown for the  opportunistic 49ers, who were outgained 301 yards to 283 but turned their  opponent's misplays into a victory for the second straight week.  </P> <P> Steve Young was unspectacular in place of Montana but still passed for one  touchdown to Jerry Rice and rushed for another as San Francisco relied on its  ground game for a change.  </P> <P> "We really wanted to establish the running game," said Rice, who caught just  three passes as the 49ers ran the ball 43 times. "If we really can balance  everything out with the running and the passing, we're going to be hard to  stop."  </P> <P> The game meant little to the 49ers, 13-2 and assured of the home-field  advantage throughout the NFC playoffs, and everything to the 8-7 Bills, who are  now in a three-way tie for first place in the AFC East.  </P> <P> But the difference wasn't apparent as the Bills lost for the fourth time in  five games and fourth straight on the road.  </P> <P> "All the last few games have been in our grasp," Bills nose tackle Fred Smerlas  said. "How many teams beat us this year? None -- we beat ourselves. . . . When  you keep cutting your throat, eventually you run out of blood."  </P> <P> The Bills could have clinched their second straight divisional title with a win  following Indianapolis' 42-13 rout of Miami.  </P> <P> Instead, they left here tied with the Colts and Dolphins and pondering another  late-season slump -- they've hurt their postseason prospects by losing three of  their last four in each of the last three years -- heading into Saturday's road  game against the New York Jets.  </P> <P> They still will win the division with a victory, but could miss the playoffs  with a loss.  </P> <P> The Bills set up a 21-point San Francisco burst in 5:10 of the second half by  losing the ball in their own territory on three straight possessions.  </P> <P> Beleaguered Bill quarterback Jim Kelly was 26 of 42 for 265 yards, but threw  three interceptions, two in the second half. He scored Buffalo's only touchdown  on a one-yard run with 7:49 remaining before Andre Reed's fumble and another  interception killed any comeback hopes.  </P></p>

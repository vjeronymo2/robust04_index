			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yelena Matveyeva; first paragraph MOSCOW NEWS </F> comment]    [Text] A string of barges hauled along by a mighty tugboat  is now icebound in the lower reaches of the Amur.    The vessels frozen in the middle of the river threaten an  ecological catastrophe, not only in the lower Amur but all along  the great Far Eastern river, because the barges carry tons of  toxic chemicals destined for use in some technical operations at  the Mnogovershynnyi ore-dressing plant.    At the start of the navigation season some local inept  ``managers'' dispatched the caravan from Komsomolsk-on-Amur to  Nikolayevsk, on a long trip down the river, unmindful of the  consequences. As we know, the expedition never reached its  destination, finding itself stuck in ice. Ecologists insist that  the hazardous cargo must immediately be removed from the river.  But in order to do this, it is necessary to lay a winter road to  the barges from the settlement of Mnogovershynnyi that would  span 200 km and stretch across ice-covered bogs and ice hummocks  on numerous smaller rivers. The project will require a lot of  machinery and quite some time. Special motor vehicles will have  to be laid on to evacuate the toxic reagents. The locals are not  yet ready to mount this kind of large-scale rescue operation.  Meanwhile, residents of coastal settlements have started  ``appropriating'' the cargoes, according to a time-honoured  Russian custom, in the belief that they can come in useful in  the household. A goodly proportion of the hazardous load is  already scattered across Amur ice and coated with snow banks and  drifts. In the spring all that will find its way into the river  which until recently was believed to have the world's largest  fish population. Today the Amur is in the fourth category of the  water pollution table for major rivers which means its waters  cannot be used, and much, less, consumed by man.</p>

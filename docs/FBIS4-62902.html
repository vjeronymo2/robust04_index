			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Moscow Mayak Radio Network in Russian at  0522 GMT on 19 May carries a live report by correspondent Heimar  Lenk from Tallinn on the government crisis in Estonia.  Reception is good.    Lenk says: "Late in the evening the government gathered for  an emergency closed sitting. I can tell you that at this moment  the Fatherland Party government is still in power in Estonia.  However, the party, which has been in power the past year and  one-half, has an exceptionally low popularity level among the  public. It has been reported that five ministers tendered their  resignation at last nights meeting."</p>

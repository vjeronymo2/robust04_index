			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / International Company News: Norway watchdog under scrutiny NORWAY is preparing for the merger of its central bank and the Banking Insurance Securities Commission (BISC) - a government-funded watchdog - as pressure mounts on Mr Svein Aasmundstad, the controversial head of BISC, to step down. The finance ministry has set up a four-person committee to study the feasibility of such a merger. A decision is expected in early May when the revised national budget for 1992 will be unveiled. A merger would end the autonomy of the BISC, set up five years ago, but it would strengthen its credibility, which has been called into question on several occasions because of Mr Aasmundstad's public outspokenness. In a recent outburst, a local news agency quoted the BISC chief as saying that the government was considering a write-down of the value of Den norske Bank's shares to zero. Afterwards, trading in DnB's volatile shares was suspended on the Oslo bourse for several hours on February 28. Before the suspension they plunged NKr1.70 to NKr5.30 on concerns over the bank's capital adequacy. The finance ministry quickly issued a statement confirming that DnB's capital adequacy met legal limits. In a separate incident, Mr Aasmundstad last June warned that the government could intervene in Fokus Bank, the third biggest bank, until a bigger Norwegian bank was found to take it over. At that time, Fokus enjoyed a bourse listing and its future nationalisation was not yet known. The BISC chief's candour on stock-sensitive information is understood to annoy bourse and other finance officials. The idea of a merger of BISC and the central bank was first floated last June by Mr Hermod Skaanland, the central bank's governor, in a speech on the occasion of the bank's 150th anniversary. Mr Skaanland said then that a synergy could be derived from integrating the two institutions. Mr Aasmundstad's future was discussed last Friday with Mr Arne Oeien, secretary-general of the finance ministry. The ministry said the issue would be clarified in consultation with Mr Aasmundstad.</p>

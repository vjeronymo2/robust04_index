			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by B. d'Armagnac: "An American Ally for France </F> Telecom and Deutsche Telekom"]    [Text] International competition is forcing the two  operators to seek out alliances. A Franco-German alliance  presupposes changes in the European laws regulating competition.  Parallel discussions with AT&amp;T reportedly are under way...    France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom are discussing a  possible  strengthening of their strategic alliance. Charles Rozmaryn,  France Telecom's general manager, told 01 INFORMATIQUE that  relations with Germany are "the keystone of international growth  strategy" for the French communications operator. But to  intensify their cooperation and conclude alliances, France  Telecom and Deutsche Telekom must overcome several juridical  obstacles. First of all, their charters must be reformed, with  employee status and entitlements promising to present  particularly thorny problems on both sides of the Rhine. Next,  they will have to lobby to ensure their rapprochement is not  blocked by current European legislation governing competition.  Recently, top-level executives of France Telecom and Deutsche  Telekom have held meetings at the European Commission with  Commission President Jacques Delors. "The basic problem is to  re-examine the framework of competition in the Community, which  needs to be modernized," says a high-ranking official in  Brussels, adding that "Europe needs large groups, of the sort  that eventually could develop from partnerships between big  enterprises such as these two [telecommunications] operators."  Jacques Delors's activities in this area already represent the  first informal steps toward rethinking that framework.    The Franco-German duo also needs support outside Europe. In  late 1991 the two partners created a joint subsidiary, Eunetcom,  for LAN [local area network] outsourcing. But if Eunetcom is to  offer services on a truly planetwide scale, it needs allies.  Hence the rumors of discussions with AT&amp;T. "Everyone is  talking  to everyone else. As we have already said, we're looking for a  partner in the United States and another one in Southeast Asia.  The BT-MCI alliance simply means there is one less partner for  Eunetcom," Rozmaryn concludes.</p>

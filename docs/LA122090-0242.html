			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> STATE;  </P> <P> TRAUMA DAMAGES FOR JOB BIAS BANNED BY STATE SUPREME COURT  </P> <P> The state Supreme Court struck a severe blow to California's civil rights  commission today, barring it from awarding damages for emotional distress or  other personal harm caused by job discrimination.  </P> <P> The 5-2 ruling eliminates the ability of the Fair Employment and Housing  Commission to order damages for most victims of sexual or racial harassment,  who commonly suffer no losses in salary but sue for the trauma and humiliation  caused by employers' mistreatment.  </P> <P> Victims could still go to court and sue for a full range of damages. But suits  are available only to those who can afford a lawyer, and generally take far  longer than the commission's proceedings, which are prosecuted by a state  lawyer.  </P> <P> The court said the commission is authorized only to order back pay and  reinstatement for wrongfully fired employees and to require employers to  prevent future discrimination.  </P></p>

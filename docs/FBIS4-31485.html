			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 8/6/1994 -- "A deep crisis  erupted in the main political force of the opposition," said  politician Silviu Brucan in an interview with the LIBERTATEA  daily newspaper speaking about the events of the past week  related to the Democratic Convention of Romania [CDR]. He  declared that the two points of view expressed by Dinu Patriciu,  the leader of the Liberal Party '93 [PL-93] and by Corneliu  Coposu, the leader of the PNTCD [National Peasant  Christian-Democratic Party] can be considered as a "dynamite  fuse" inside the CDR.    At the end of May Dinu Patriciu assessed that the only  chance  for the CDR to be successful in the next elections was to turn  itself from a coalition having its own right-wing ideology into  a party, but his proposal was fully rejected by all members of  the CDR. "It was a reaction easily to foresee, as the CDR was  the umbrella for many parties that avoided to disclose their  ideology and state their extraction," said Silviu Brucan. He  said that the CDR has made its option so far for a quick  political reckoning by saying that they will receive the  population's ballots as a result of their discontent with the  decline of living standard and consequently the CDR could exist  more as an election forum rather than an option for a government.    The statement made a few days ago in Paris by Corneliu  Coposu, the leader of the PNTCD, namely that in the event his  party will take the power they will amend the Constitution and  bring back the monarchy, proves, said Brucan, "lack of political  thinking and strategy." As long as there are powerful forces  within the CDR which do not agree to the idea of monarchy, it is  unlikely, so said Brucan, for them to draw up joint tickets and  program platforms for the elections. As the majority of the  voting people are republican supporters, Corneliu Coposu's  assertion "severely" diminishes the votes to be possibly granted  to the CDR.    The crisis generated within the CDR by the declarations of  the two politicians has affected "negatively the whole Romanian  political life, as a strong opposition is badly needed for a  democratic system to work."</p>

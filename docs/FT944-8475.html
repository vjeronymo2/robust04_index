			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Inntrepreneur For Grand Metropolitan, the refinancing of Inntrepreneur Estates (IEL) is good but not ideal. Good, because GrandMet is to be repaid a net Pounds 332m as a result of the tidying-up exercise and is set to shed day-to-day management responsibility for the 50 per cent-owned operation. Far from ideal, because GrandMet is not making a complete withdrawal from the pubs business. It still has Pounds 212m of equity tied up in IEL and may have to wait for three or four years before it can extract itself fully - probably by means of a flotation - from what is no longer a core business. It is just possible that an exit route will present itself before then. Courage, the brewer which owns the other 50 per cent of IEL, is widely rumoured to be up for sale. The precise intentions of Foster's Brewing Group, Courage's parent, remain inscrutable but the IEL refinancing is a small pointer to a possible disposal. Courage's willingness, along with GrandMet, to inject Pounds 28m of fresh equity into IEL looks strange in the light of Foster's questionable commitment to the UK market: unless, that is, the investment helps sort out IEL's finances to the point where the whole operation would look more attractive to a buyer. Sentiment towards GrandMet, whose shares have underperformed by nearly 10 per cent in the past six months, would improve if it could remove the IEL millstone from around its neck sooner rather than later.</p>

			<p><P> May 9, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ART  </P> <P> Comedian Jonathan Winters, in San Francisco to receive a doctor of humane  letters degree from the Academy of Art College, also showed off some of his  oddly titled paintings. "Pathetic Black Moon with Awful Vase with Dead Flowers  in It," is what Winters calls a "put-on of a large white canvas with a little  red dot on its center that the Museum of Modern Art in New York paid 200 grand  for." Then there's "Two Birds Watching Doris Day's Cat and Dog Drown." Winters  said that while Day is involved in various animal protection causes, the  painting has nothing to do with her. Instead, it's "just my black humor at  work." Winters, 63, studied art at Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio, and the  Dayton Art Institute. He holds a bachelor of fine arts degree from Dayton.

			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / Reagan no longer a judicial target in Iran-Contra case FORMER President Ronald Reagan is no longer a target in the criminal investigation being conducted into the Iran-Contra affair. His lawyer said yesterday he had received a letter from Mr Lawrence Walsh, the Iran-Contra special prosecutor, stating that he was now regarded only as a witness, and not a subject, in the investigation. Mr Walsh has said other indictments against senior figures in the Reagan administration might be brought by the end of the summer. So far only Mr Caspar Weinberger, the former defence secretary, has been charged. He is accused of concealing from Congress his knowledge of the White House scheme to sell arms to Iran and use the proceeds to finance the Contra rebels in Nicaragua, in defiance of the congressional ban on such assistance. Last week, Mr Donald Regan, former treasury secretary and White House chief of staff, said he had been advised by the prosecutor that he was no longer under scrutiny. Less clear is the status of Mr George Shultz, former secretary of state, and Mr Edwin Meese, attorney general when the Iran-Contra scheme was in operation. The New York Times reported yesterday that Mr Frank Carlucci, national security adviser to Mr Reagan at the time, had been questioned recently by the prosecutors.</p>

			<p><P> September 28, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWS ANALYSIS;  </P> <P> SOVIET LAWMAKERS FACE TEST OF DEMOCRACY -- AND DUCK;  </P> <P> REFORM: DEPUTIES, UNABLE TO DECIDE ON AN ECONOMIC COURSE, PASS THE ISSUE TO  GORBACHEV.  </P> <P> Soviet democracy, so young and fragile, was facing its biggest challenge this  week -- restructuring the country's entire economic system -- and the nation's  lawmakers reverted quickly to political tradition by yielding to the leadership  most of their powers to decide and act.  </P> <P> The Supreme Soviet, the country's legislature, was asked to choose between two  reform programs, one that aims at developing a market economy in the next year  and a half, replacing the failed system of state socialism, and the other that  foresees a far more gradual transition.  </P> <P> More was at stake, however, than the tempo of reform, for the two programs are  based on entirely different political philosophies. The gradual approach  largely seeks to preserve socialism and the radical stance abandons that  ideology entirely.  </P> <P> For the Soviet Union, forged by the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution and seven decades  of Communist leadership, the choice would be historic and fateful, reshaping  one of the world's great powers as it moves into the 21st Century. Only rarely  is such a momentous question posed so directly to a parliament.  </P> <P> It was a decision toward which perestroika, the five years of political and  economic reforms under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, had been aimed, one that  could determine the success or failure of those reforms and one that would  project the authority of the Supreme Soviet as an institution of the new  democracy.  </P> <P> It was also an issue that the people's deputies, as the lawmakers are known,  had debated frequently in the 16 months since the Supreme Soviet was  reconstituted on the basis of the country's first free elections in 70 years.  </P> <P> But the deputies were not ready. Study, they did; debate, they did, but decide,  they could not. In the end, they delegated their legislative powers to  Gorbachev, enabling him to rule the country by decree in order to promote the  reforms.  </P> <P> The Supreme Soviet's inability to decide such a crucial issue dismayed many,  and it has now raised serious questions about the future of democracy here.  </P> <P> The deputies did approve the radical reform program "in principle" on Monday,  but they asked Gorbachev to combine it with the rival program and modify the  result according to comments and criticism received from around the country.  They will review this "unified program" in mid-October.  </P> <P> The legislators then authorized Gorbachev to take almost any actions he thinks  necessary to carry out the reforms, subject only to a possible veto by the  Supreme Soviet. His extraordinary powers will run until March 31, 1992.  </P> <P> The deputies, while committing the nation to reforms meant to democratize and  decentralize, have reverted to the old system of top-down commands; after  assuming decision-making authority from the Communist Party, they handed it  over to the president, who himself appeared paralyzed with indecision.  </P> <P> They also weakened their own institution by avoiding what was clearly a hard  decision for many of the 522 active deputies, but a decision that would have  clearly established the political authority of the Supreme Soviet.  </P> <P> And, by wavering on the scope and speed of the reform program, they failed to  end the crisis of confidence that many Soviet political commentators see as  threatening to turn the country's political and economic problems into chaos,  anarchy and even civil war.  </P> <P> "The deputies displayed a shocking incompetence and unwillingness to assume  responsibility," Nikolai Y. Petrakov, Gorbachev's economic adviser, said,  describing the decisions as a "defeat" for the Supreme Soviet as the nation's  legislative body.  </P> <P> "The deputies should be the most in tune with the people, and yet here the  president had to set the pace and take all the responsibility onto his  shoulders. This was not his desire, but the nation could not wait."  </P> <P> A legal commentator for Komsomolskaya Pravda, one of the most widely read  newspapers, called the action "a virtual freeze in the development of the  law-governed state" and "a step back from the separation of powers toward their  concentration in the person of the president."  </P> <P> Other commentators, who had written of the nation's "hour of choice," lamented  that the deputies had avoided making a choice themselves.  </P> <P> And radicals in the Inter-Regional Group of Deputies, many of whom voted  against granting Gorbachev the extraordinary powers or abstained on the  measure, caucused Wednesday to express their dissatisfaction with the  legislature's failure to act decisively itself on the economic reforms.  </P> <P> "A failure of political will," one commented. Another called it "a shameful  abdication of power."  </P> <P> But Yuri V. Golik, chairman of the Supreme Soviet's committee on legislation,  defended the moves as necessary so Gorbachev could act immediately to stabilize  the political and economic situation. He compared the authority given Gorbachev  to the emergency powers that Congress granted President Franklin D. Roosevelt  during the Great Depression of the 1930s.  </P> <P> "The Supreme Soviet should exercise control over what the president does,"  Golik said. "Much still depends on the Supreme Soviet."  </P> <P> Other crucial issues lie ahead. Gorbachev will submit the "unified" program in  two weeks, and the deputies may be asked for their endorsement. The Soviet  Union's future as a federal system is under discussion after the declarations  of "sovereignty" by virtually all 15 constituent republics. Other far-reaching  legislation is pending.  </P> <P> There are now serious doubts, however, about the ability of the Supreme Soviet  or its parent body -- the Congress of People's Deputies, which as the national  parliament has ultimate authority -- to deal with fundamental or complex  issues. There is even discussion in the press about whether they should be  dissolved and new elections held, or simply disbanded as failures.  </P> <P> Many radicals, paradoxically, appear as ready to accept strong presidential  rule as do conservatives, seeing in Gorbachev a surer and faster means of  achieving fundamental reforms. While committed to democracy, they have grown  increasingly fearful that perestroika has lost all its momentum and has  stalled.  </P> <P> Amid the worried discussion in recent months about whether the armed forces are  planning a coup, perhaps in conjunction with elements of the Communist Party's  leadership, some liberal commentators have argued that Gorbachev might do well  to use the military in this way to establish a market economy, since soldiers  would follow orders where bureaucrats have not, and they would impose order  where chaos looms.  </P> <P> Stanislav S. Shatalin, the principal author of the radical economic reform  program, acknowledged the legislators' actions as "a failure for democracy,"  but he attributed it largely to the sheer youth of the Supreme Soviet as an  institution and the inexperience of its members and called for patience.  </P> <P> "Imagine yourself a deputy, and you will see you are living in a system that  has nothing to do with the tasks before you," he said in an interview  Wednesday. "Yet, you have to be ready to make decisions on a new system that  you do not know or understand. . . . Everyone of us is still learning. . . ."  </P></p>

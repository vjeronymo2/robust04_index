			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Zhang Hongtou (1728 3163 3447)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 18 Jan (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)-- Mr. Zhang  Tong, president of the China Great Wall Industry Corporation,  said today that there is no reason to continue sanctions on his  company by the United States and that he regrets this.    Zhang Tong said this to reporters after a signing ceremony  held here between the China Great Wall Industry Corporation and  Asia-Pacific Satellite Telecommunications Company on a  commercial launch service for the Asia-Pacific Sat-2 satellite,  saying that the China Great Wall Industry Corporation's  commercial launch services for international satellite clients  are a useful supplement to the international satellite launching  market and provide options for international satellite users.  He said that we welcome the U.S. Government's recent  announcement to lift the ban on three satellites that will be  launched by China, though regrettably this did not include the  sanctions on the China Great Wall Industry Corporation. With the  imminent dissolution of COCOM [Coordinating Committee for  Multilateral Export Controls], the U.S. Government should adjust  its current space policy, issue other satellite permits, and  revoke sanctions on the corporation. This would not only  benefit international clients, but would also protect the  interests of U.S. satellite makers. Furthermore, he said, with  the expiration at the end of this year of the memorandum on  commercial launch services and international trade problems  signed between the Chinese and U.S. Governments in 1989, we hope  that the U.S. and Chinese Governments can begin talks on the  issue of extending the memorandum as soon as possible in order  to facilitate a good environment for normal space trade between  the two countries.    Zhang Tong revealed that since China announced the  introduction of its self-made Long March carrier rocket series  to the international market in 1985, the corporation, in joint  efforts with its domestic partners -- namely the Research  Institute of Carrier Rocket Technology, which researches and  produces rockets, and the China Satellite Launch Detection and  Control System Department, which takes charge of launch  operations, detection, and control -- has steadily eased, after  years of arduous work, China's carrier rockets into the  international commercial satellite launching service market.  The Great Wall Industry Corporation has successfully launched  many satellites for international clients. Other launch services  under contract include the International Communications  Satellite 7A, Asia-Pacific Sat-1, Asiasat 2, Iridium and Echo  Satellites, and a resources satellite in cooperation with  Brazil. As it has done in the past, the China Great Wall  Industry Corporation will, with its good reputation and quality  work, offer its clients reliable services.</p>

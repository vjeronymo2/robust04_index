			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Lower interest costs aid London &amp; Clydeside With the help of much lower interest charges, London &amp; Clydeside Holdings, the USM-quoted housebuilder operating throughout Scotland, reported an 84 per cent rise in pre-tax profits in the year to September 30. Lower turnover of Pounds 21.2m was because last year's figure of Pounds 21.98m included the sale of an office block for Pounds 2.5m. After interest payable of Pounds 913,000 (Pounds 1.58m), pre-tax profit came to Pounds 742,000 (Pounds 404,000). This year's result would have been higher but for a write-down connected with a Glasgow office block developed by an associate company. Earnings per share rose 79 per cent to 5.2p (2.9p) and the final dividend has been increased to 3p making 4.8p (4.5p) for the year.</p>

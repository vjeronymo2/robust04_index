			<p><P> November 7, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> LONDON CLUB ALLOWS TALK AT BREAKFAST; MEMBERS SHOCKED  </P> <P> Members of an exclusive London gentlemen's club expressed shock and outrage  after a new rule was introduced allowing the "American custom" of talking at  breakfast.  </P> <P> Reporting on the end of one of the most cherished traditions of the  111-year-old Savile Club, the Sunday Telegraph, a pillar of the British  establishment, said the death knell was sounded in just 13 words.  </P> <P> "The general committee has agreed to a trial period of conversation at  breakfast," a club announcement said.  </P> <P> Club secretary Peter Aldersly said members had liked to be able to read their  newspapers in peace, but times have changed.  </P> <P> "There are some members who want business breakfasts. It's an American custom,"  he explained.  </P> <P> But historian Lord Dacre, a member for nearly 50 years, reacted angrily. "Good  God! I shall resign at once," he said.  </P></p>

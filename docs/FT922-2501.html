			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Moscow offers India weapons joint ventures MOSCOW has offered to set up joint ventures in India to manufacture and export tanks and aircraft to Third World countries, a Russian embassy spokesman said, Reuter reports from New Delhi. 'Arms sales are a very important means of hard currency for Russia and India has been a durable defence partner with tested manufacturing capability,' Mr Vladimir Grachev said. Mr Grachev said that under the offer India, currently manufacturing tanks and MiG-21, MiG-23 and MiG-27 jet fighters under licence from the former Soviet Union, could become a fully fledged partner in a joint venture with Moscow. He said India, a key non-communist political ally of the former Soviet Union, continued to have strong defence ties with Moscow. An Indian defence ministry spokesman said that he had no knowledge of the offer and would not say whether one would be considered. Two months ago, Russia extended a Dollars 830m defence credit to India. 'It's not an easy time for us to give credits, but India has always been the special exception,' Mr Grachev said. He said Russia saw a lucrative market for its arms in developing countries. 'A little updated version of MiG-21s would sell like hotdogs.' Russia has also agreed to sell India rocket engines for its space programme, which had its first important success last month when an Indian-made rocket took an Indian-made satellite into orbit.</p>

			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Breakthrough near in BA-USAir talks A breakthrough appeared imminent last night in talks between the UK and US governments which would clear the way for British Airways to acquire for Dollars 750m (Pounds 436m) a 44 per cent stake in USAir, the sixth largest US airline. Mr Andrew Card, US transportation secretary, is due to hold an unscheduled meeting today in London with Mr John MacGregor, his UK counterpart. The meeting is widely seen as a sign that the Bush administration is keen to reach swift agreement with the UK on a new, more liberal, bilateral aviation agreement and approve BA's investment in USAir. The White House has come under intense pressure from the three largest US carriers - American Airlines, United Airlines and Delta Air Lines - to block the BA-USAir deal unless it can secure an open skies agreement between the two countries and greater access for US carriers into the UK market. The big three US carriers appeared concerned last night at the surprise visit of Mr Card, fearing it could lead to a hasty agreement which they claim could damage their competitive positions. US and UK negotiators began a new round of talks on this controversial issue in London yesterday. Until Mr Card announced his decision to fly to London it was widely felt the current round of talks was unlikely to produce a concrete result. The big three carriers suggested this week they did not expect an agreement until after the US presidential election on November 3. But the BA-USAir deal was brought to the forefront of the US political debate on Monday by Mr Ross Perot, the independent presidential candidate, who attacked the venture during the final television debate between the three election contenders. He claimed the deal could damage the domestic airline industry and Mr Bill Clinton, the Democratic candidate, also suggested the US should only approve the deal if it received equal market access to the UK. The Bush administration and Mr Card are believed to favour the BA investment in USAir as it would help secure the US carrier's future, protect domestic jobs and encourage foreign investment. The White House has indicated it is prepared to consider the UK's proposal to phase in liberalisation in air transport. But the UK has also insisted the US approve the BA-USAir deal before agreeing to a new aviation regime between the two countries. During the presidential debate Mr Perot used the BA-USAir deal to reinforce his complaint that US interests were hurt by the presence of too many lobbyists in the big party campaigns. But the Texas billionaire neglected to declare his own substantial financial interest in the airline industry. The Perot Group donated land for the recently opened Alliance Airport between Dallas and Fort Worth and then lobbied for millions of dollars in federal money to build the airport. The group stands to benefit from development of an estimated 18,000 acres of land it owns around the Alliance site. In addition, one of Alliance's main customers is Dallas-based American Airlines, whose payments for Alliance facilities underwrite some of the airport's debt and which is leading the lobbying fight against the BA-USAir deal. A dispute has broken out over whether the US government is glossing over an impending financial crisis in the banking sector, which could cost billions of dollars in federal money, writes George Graham in Washington. During the 1988 US presidential election neither Democrats nor Republicans drew much attention to the looming savings and loan crisis that is expected to end up costing taxpayers Dollars 195bn (Pounds 113.3bn). In the last of three televised presidential debates, on Monday night, Mr Ross Perot, the independent candidate, raised the prospect that in the immediate aftermath of the election perhaps 100 problem banks might have to close at a cost to the taxpayer of about Dollars 100bn. This scenario is based on a study by Mr Roger Vaughan and Prof Edward Hill, published earlier this month by the Washington Post Company. The study, entitled Banking on the Brink, argues that 1,150 banks are so weakly capitalised that they are likely to fail or be forced into mergers in the next few years. While many of the banks meet current international capital standards, the authors argue that the book value of assets such as property loans overstates their real worth. 'If their assets were valued at what they would fetch today in the market, these banks would be shuttered on the spot,' the study says. Other analysts make similar predictions of a banking collapse, although some lower estimates of the likely cost. Federal officials, backed up by their analysts, reject the pessimistic calculations. 'The notion that we are hiding some kind of commercial banking bailout is utter nonsense. Stories of a December collapse are simply ridiculous,' Mr Nicholas Brady, the treasury secretary, told the American Bankers Association in Boston this week.

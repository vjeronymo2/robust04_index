			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / International Company News: HK's superman finds warmer winds from China - Simon Holberton examines Li Ka-shing's developing business relationships with the mainland IT WAS a scene that summed up just how far Mr Li Ka-shing, the Hong Kong property tycoon and much else besides, has come since 1989. This April, the man whom Hong Kong's citizenry likes to call 'superman', was on hand to lend his lustre and support at the launch of New China Hong Kong, an investment company that marries impeccable mainland connections and Hong Kong money and which is fronted by Mr T. T. Tsui, another local tycoon. On the dais at Hong Kong's Hilton Hotel, Mr Li rubbed shoulders and joked with Mr Zhou Nan, head of the New China News Agency, Beijing's unofficial 'embassy' in the colony, and Mr Guo Fengming, China's top negotiator in talks with the UK about Hong Kong's transfer of sovereignty in 1997. In 1989, after the Tiananmen Square protests, Mr Li was openly hostile to the Beijing regime. He talked of diversifying his assets away from Hong Kong, and he was also critical of local businessmen who publicly justified Beijing's suppression of the demonstrators. 'If you bend with the political wind, if you have no principles, probably you'll have an easier time doing business around here,' he told the Asian Wall Street Journal in November 1989. 'I would much rather keep my mouth shut than say what I don't believe to be true.' Mr Li is still keeping his mouth shut, but since China re-embraced economic reform more than a year ago he has judged the political wind to be warming. He is now spending most of his time on the China-related business ventures in which his two main listed companies - Cheung Kong and Hutchison Whampoa - are engaged, and in the task of developing contacts with Beijing's power brokers. Mr Li has forged links with a son and a son-in-law of Mr Deng Xiaoping, China's frail senior leader, and with Shougang Corporation, the third-largest Chinese steelmaker headquartered in Beijing and backed by Deng. His latest foray into the Hong Kong stock market - the attempted takeover of Miramar Hotel and Investment - is with Mr Larry Yung, the son of Mr Rong Yiren, China's vice-president, and the head of Citic Pacific, Beijing's premiere investment company in Hong Kong. As befits a cautious man, Mr Li has not placed all his eggs in the same basket. Although he has spent most of his time cultivating the children of Mr Deng, he has also given assistance to the children of Mr Chen Yun, Mr Deng's ideological opponent and chief rival for supreme power. Last December, he helped China Venturetech, a company controlled by Ms Chen Weili, to acquire a Hong Kong listing. His Cheung Kong joined with Venturetech to take over Public International, an investment company which is China Venturetech's listed vehicle in the colony. Mr Li's cultivation of China's top leaders and their offspring, is simply the conventional Chinese approach to business. As Mr Li and other Hong Kong tycoons know, in China the way to get deals done is through personal connections with powerful people. Says Miss Pauline Loong, China analyst at brokers Jardine Fleming: 'The fact is that Deng's children are all important people. They know other important people, and their power will survive the death of their father.' But there is also a pattern emerging in the deals Mr Li is doing. Shougang, in addition to being an important steel producer in China, also has a large construction business. Last week, Mr Li strengthened his connections with China's metals industry when he joined with China National Non-ferrous Metals Corp (CNNC), the vice-president of which is Mr Wu Jianchang, a son-in-law of Mr Deng. Last month, Mr Li joined with Mr Deng Zhifang, Mr Deng's son, and Shougang to take over Kadar Investment, a local Hong Kong property company. The Kadar takeover appears to be more akin to Mr Li's tilt at Miramar which, in an unusual development for Hong Kong, has run in to problems with a counterbidder. But the mainland tie-ups seem to serve an important strategic interest in China. 'I think that one of the important lessons Mr Li has learned from his 30 years in business is the importance of control of the market you operate in,' says Mr Archie Hart, director of research at brokers Crosby Securities. 'He has made a lot of money in Hong Kong by controlling the property market and the container port. He wants to apply that principle to his business interests in China.' In China, Mr Li is involved in projects worth HKDollars 129.2bn (USDollars 16.7bn), of which his attributable interest is HKDollars 19.7bn. Investments are wide ranging and include ports development and power station construction, but most of his investments are in property. 'He knows he can not exercise the same control over land in China as he does in Hong Kong so he has opted for tie-ups with companies that are important to the construction process,' says Mr Hart. With building materials' prices in southern China rising by more than 50 per cent in the first three months of this year compared with a year earlier, access to materials has become a priority for developers. Mr Li's new found friends in Beijing just might be able to help.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                   LI KA-SHING'S BEIJING CONNECTIONS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Target              K S Li's      Chinese      Leadership                   interest (%)    partner      connection  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Kader Inv.             9.1      Sifang Grand   Deng Zhifang, son                                 Development    of Deng Xiaoping                                 Shougang Corpn Zhou Guanwu, chairman;                                                member of National                                                People's Congress; Deng                                                protege  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Oriental Metals       18.0      China National Wu Jianchang,                                 Non-ferrous    Deng's son-in-law                                 Metals                                 Metals Corp  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Public Intl            9.2      China         Ms Chen Weili, daughter                                 Venturetech   of Chen Yun  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Tung Wing Steel       21.0      Shougang      Deng-endorsed company  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Santai Mfg*           16.3      Shougang      Deng-endorsed company  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- *Subsequently sold.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: stock exchange announcements  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

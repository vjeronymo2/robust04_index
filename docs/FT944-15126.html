			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / State SPD may defy party line Social Democrats in the east German state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern are determined to keep open the option of forming a government with the Party of Democratic Socialism, the reformed communists, in spite of strong pressure from the federal SPD leadership to form a grand coalition with the ruling CDU, state officials said yesterday. The SPD won 29.5 per cent of the vote, giving them 23 seats in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern in Sunday's state election, just above the PDS, which won 22.7 per cent and 18 seats. The CDU, which won 37.7 per cent of the vote and 30 seats, formed the last government in coalition with the Free Democrats but the FDP failed to get re-elected to the state parliament. Mr Harald Ringstorff, leader of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern's SPD, has been told by the party's federal leadership to start coalition talks with the CDU. 'We will start talks with the CDU tomorrow,' an SPD spokesperson said. 'But if we do not succeed, we will keep the door open to the PDS despite pressure from Bonn.' The SPD federal leadership has since June tolerated the SPD/Green coalition in the eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt, whose minority government relies on the support of the PDS, but it is unwilling to allow formal coalition with the former communists.</p>

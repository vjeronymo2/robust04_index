			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa at a joint </F> news conference with ROK President Kim Yong-sam held at the  State Guesthouse in Tokyo -- live]    [Text] I would like to give my remarks first. It is a  great pleasure to welcome President and Mrs. Kim Yong-sam as our  state guests this time, following our recent talks in Kyungchu.  At the current summit talks held following the last talks, we  were able to have a broad exchange of views in a frank way on  relations and cooperation between our two nations.    As one who is also engaged in reforms, I would like to  express my sincere respects to President Kim Yong-sam for his  continuous efforts in carrying out reforms at home with his  excellent leadership.    It goes without saying that to promote development of  Japan-ROK relations, it is important to further deepen the  understanding between peoples of our two nations on the basis of  lessons learned from past history. And, it is based on this  concept that we have recently decided to provide new support for  ROK students studying in Japan.    To enable Japan-ROK relations to mature further, I would  like  to talk with the president on the need for the diversification  and internationalization of bilateral relations.  Diversification means promoting exchanges in various fields and  between the people of various generations. As for  internationalization, this means that Japan and the ROK should  promote cooperative relations between our two countries in the  international community. I believe that with the approach of  the 21st century, our cooperation in the international community  will become more and more extensive. And, I feel that through  such cooperation, we will be able to actually realize that Japan  and the ROK are two irreplaceable partners for each other.    The issue of North Korea's development of nuclear weapons  has  now become the most serious concern in Northeast Asia, where our  two countries are located. We have discussed this issue at the  current talks, and President Kim and I share the view that it is  important to settle the issue through close cooperation with  China, the United States, and other concerned nations.    I am convinced that through President Kim Yong-sam's current  visit to Japan, we have been able to further develop the  friendly relationship between our two nations. And I believe it  is important for us to solidify this friendly relationship for  the future of the peoples of our two nations as a whole, and  with the president, I would like to do my best for this purpose.    Thank you very much.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Vasil Vasylyovych Onopenko, minister of </F> justice of Ukraine, by Galina Khmilevskaya, KRIMSKAYA SVITLITSYA  special correspondent; place and date not given: "Which Way Is  the Crimean Peninsula Drifting"]    [Text] On 24 February 1994 the Supreme Council of  Ukraine passed a decree "On the Status of the Autonomous  Republic of Crimea in Accordance with Legislation of Ukraine. It  emphasizes that "the Crimea is an autonomous constituent part of  Ukraine and therefore is not a bearer of state sovereignty and  cannot enter into political relations with foreign states." The  Crimea does not have its own citizenship separate from that of  Ukraine. It cannot have its own military formations and its own  monetary system.    The Supreme Council of Ukraine proposed that the  Crimean leadership bring the legislation of the autonomous  republic into conformity with the legislation of Ukraine.    Galina Khmilevskaya, a special correspondent of the  KRIMSKAYA SVITLITSYA newspaper, met with Vasyl Vasylyovych  Onopenko, minister of justice of Ukraine, on the eve of an  examination of the Crimean question in parliament. We present  the interview with him.    [Khmilevskaya] It is being suggested to Crimeans that  supposedly independent Ukraine, in contrast to the Crimea, does  not have its own constitution, and that it is therefore living  according to the old constitution, specifically the Constitution  of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. What is this--a  propaganda trick? Counting on the people's lack of legal  information?    [Onopenko] I am amazed by such a statement. Ukraine has its  own constitution--the constitution of an independent,  democratic, and rule-of-law state. And this, in particular, is  indicated in paragraph 1 of Article 68 of the Constitution of  Ukraine and other articles.    [Khmilevskaya] Consequently, owing to amendments that were  made, we have a constitution that is new in content...    [Onopenko] Yes, we are living according to the Constitution  of Ukraine and not according to that of the Ukrainian Soviet  Socialist Republic, as was the case at one time. Dozens of  amendments have been made, according to which the Basic Law has  been brought into conformity with current requirements.    It is true that there are some old laws that we are  compelled  to use, inasmuch as Ukraine has not prepared and has not turned  out all of the necessary laws. This is so, but the Constitution  of Ukraine operates and regulates the basic social processes in  the state, in particular, Ukraine's administrative-territorial  system as well...    [Khmilevskaya] ...Also establishing the status of the  Republic of Crimea?    [Onopenko] In accordance with the Constitution of Ukraine  (Article 75 superscript 1), "The Republic of Crimea is a  constituent part of Ukraine that must operate on the principles  of administrative autonomy." The legal status of the Republic of  Crimea is determined not only by this article of the  Constitution, but also by other laws, in particular, by the Law  of Ukraine of 29 April 1992 "On the Status of the Autonomous  Republic of Crimea," and the Law of 30 June 1992 "On Making  Changes and Additions to the Law of Ukraine 'On the Status of  the Autonomous Republic of Crimea,'" and also the important Laws  "On Demarcation of Powers between the Organs of State Authority  of Ukraine and the Republic of Crimea," etc.    [Khmilevskaya] Thus, no matter what we call ourselves: the  Republic of Crimea, or the island state of Crimea, we will still  be a constituent part of Ukraine according to its Basic Law?    [Onopenko] Based on the Constitution of Ukraine in effect,  this is precisely the case.    [Khmilevskaya] Then why is the "Crimean question" so  critical?    [Onopenko] The fact is that the Crimean parliament has  adopted many laws that do not agree with the basic laws and the  Constitution of Ukraine.    [Khmilevskaya] Can you name them?    [Onopenko] Listing them would take a long time. But some can  be mentioned. For example, the Constitution of Ukraine affirms  the position on associations of citizens and political parties.  This is a constitutional provision. The Constitution of Crimea  also has such a concept; moreover, a law has been passed "On  Association of Citizens." If you analyze Article 9 concerning  the association of citizens, it states that political parties  with an all-Ukrainian status can be established on the territory  of Ukraine. In the Crimean Law "On Association of Citizens" it  is an issue of some other kind of status, specifically--an  all-Crimean status... So here is your first contradiction.    [Khmilevskaya] It is this exact contradiction that blocked  the path to the Crimean parliament for branches of Ukrainian  parties operating on Crimean territory and compelled them to  unite into one (but now Crimean) party--the Ukrainian Civic  Congress of Crimea [UGKK]. The pro-Ukrainian (ruling) forces  were drawn into a registration trap, which made it practically  impossible for members of the Ukrainian Civic Congress of Crimea  to take part in the elections to the Crimean parliament on party  lists. The party was registered a week before the end of the  campaign to collect signatures. No opportunities remained. Here  is a significant fact for you that indicates in whose favor the  contradictions of the Crimean laws are arranged and operate.  Obviously, not in favor of the state-creating forces in Ukraine.    [Onopenko] It is a pity, but even the very concept of an  international political party or an international public  association are treated absolutely differently in the law of  Ukraine and the law of Crimea. After all, an international  political party is a party that has its own cells in some other  country.    We find another contradiction between the legislation of the  Crimea and Ukraine in the law on property, and even in the  terminology. In particular, Article 75 of the Constitution of  the Republic of Crimea recognizes private, collective,  municipal, state, and other property on the territory of the  republic. According to the Ukrainian law on property of 7 July  1992, private property and collective and state forms of  property exist in Ukraine. That is, there is an incongruity even  in this.    The concept of a judicial system is very dear to me.  Therefore, in accordance with the Constitution of Ukraine that  is in force, and in accordance with the laws on the judicial  system and the law on the status of judges, the Supreme Court  and the oblast court are elected by the Supreme Council of  Ukraine. If you look into the Constitution of Crimea you find  one more contradiction that works to weaken Ukrainian statehood:  The oblast (now) court of Crimea is elected by the Supreme  Council of Crimea. This is a very fundamental divergence,  inasmuch as we cannot talk about a single judicial system on the  territory of Ukraine, which can lead to very negative  consequences.    [Khmilevskaya] Vasyl Vasylyovych, does it not seem to you  that after 5 May 1992, when the Constitution of the Republic of  Ukraine was adopted, and later its operation was suspended,  nevertheless, all actions of the Crimean parliament were openly  or in a veiled way directed at separating the Crimea from  Ukraine and making it independent?    [Onopenko] You are touching on a very serious problem.  Actually, if you analyze some very important acts adopted by the  Supreme Council of Crimea (in particular, the "Act on  Proclamation of State Independence of the Republic of Crimea"  was adopted on 5 May, and later the decree "On the Conduct of an  all-Crimean Referendum" and certain other acts), they actually  denoted that the process for the legitimate secession of the  Crimea from the Ukrainian structure was being started.    [Khmilevskaya] At that time, Kiev reacted...    [Onopenko] Actually, the recent acts of the Supreme Council  of the Republic of Crimea associated with the proclamation of  state independence and the conduct of an all-Crimean referendum  were declared to be contradictory to the Constitution and laws  of Ukraine in a decree of the Supreme Council of Ukraine of 13  May 1992. It was recommended to the Supreme Council of Crimea  that it revoke the aforementioned acts. Unfortunately, it must  be said today that the Supreme Council of Crimea in fact ignored  the decision of the Ukrainian parliament and did not revoke its  constitutional decisions.    [Khmilevskaya] Who in this situation was supposed to stand  guard over the Ukrainian Constitution? Who was supposed to be  the supreme observer looking after implementation and observance  of the law?    [Onopenko] The best solution for Ukraine would be the  establishment of a Constitutional Court whose jurisdiction would  include the resolution of precisely such problems and questions.  Unfortunately, there is no Constitutional Court in Ukraine yet.    [Khmilevskaya] Who was slow with this? Why did the law on  the  Constitutional Court not pass?    [Onopenko] You see, it was the Supreme Council that was  involved in the discussion of the composition of the  Constitutional Court. Incidentally, the proposed standard for  the establishment of this court has already been included in the  current constitution. Therefore, we have a legal basis for the  creation of a Constitutional Court of Ukraine.    [Khmilevskaya] But tell me, who under these conditions is  supposed to give an evaluation of the decisions of the Supreme  Council of Crimea?    [Onopenko] The Supreme Council of Ukraine was supposed to do  this (and it actually did do so). Although a mechanism did not  exist for implementing the decree of the Ukrainian parliament  about bringing Crimean laws into conformity with Ukrainian laws.  Therefore, the decree of the Supreme Council of Ukraine of 13  May 1992 actually remained unfulfilled.    [Khmilevskaya] Of course, this situation could not help but  be exploited by those forces that are in power today... It is no  secret that five out of six candidates for president ran under  the slogans "Crimea in Russia!" and "The Ruble Zone, the  Motherland, Russia!" Although purely economic problems here were  of no small importance; after all, a crisis has enveloped  Ukraine, and the impoverishment of the people is growing.  Nevertheless, separatist aspirations played a definite role.    [Onopenko] The situation in Ukraine is really not simple.  There are extremely complicated questions of an economic,  social, and political nature. We can only ascertain that the  people decided precisely in the way that they did decide.  Therefore, when it is a question of the will of the people and  the actions of one or another leader, one or another person,  then I would like to differentiate a little between the will of  the people and the responsibility of individual officials for  one or another action. People want to live better.  Unfortunately, the situation is now such that it is not easy to  live in general either in the Crimea or in Ukraine. But when it  is a question of citizens of Ukraine who live in the Crimea,  individual persons, then we can talk about juridical and, in  particular, criminal responsibility, if premeditated actions  take place that are associated with changes in the territory of  Ukraine or its borders and are aimed at changes in the  constitutional system and structure of Ukraine. Criminal  proceedings can be instituted here that are envisioned in  Article 62 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine.    [Khmilevskaya] It is personally insulting to me that in the  course of two years some leaders uttered these criminal slogans  at every rally, and one of them even permitted himself to call  Ukraine "a neighboring state" at meetings of the Crimean  parliament. And official Kiev observed all of this calmly, so no  energetic actions were undertaken. Today these leaders can  defend themselves with the will of the people. The situation, as  you see, changed. Behind them are the people who gave them their  votes, who voted for those slogans which are in themselves  criminal to a certain degree.    [Onopenko] You are right in saying that the situation has  changed, and that the will of the people is present. But there  is also the will of the people of Ukraine. Constitutional  principles of an independent Ukraine as a legal democratic state  exist. Therefore, here, if we are to conduct a policy with  respect to the Crimea, it is impossible to use only legal  language from the standpoint of legal norms only. In my opinion,  Ukraine should have conducted a more subtle and flexible policy  with respect to the Crimea: economic, political, and social.  After all, where Ukraine and its state structures did not do  enough work, this gap was inevitably filled by someone, which  led to those shortcomings that are present now.    As for the responsibility of certain specific persons,  including criminal responsibility, I would not want to  concentrate attention on this, inasmuch as the question of one  or another legal responsibility of each specific person should  be resolved only in the established order, and only on the basis  of collected evidence can a court declare a specific person  guilty of one or another act.    [Khmilevskaya] But if there is no such evidence, then it is  also impossible to institute proceedings against one or another  person...    Dear Vasyl Vasylyovych, I have already said that the heads  of  a good half of Crimeans have been zombie-ized or stupefied by  the idea that the Crimea is "a separate state" (three years of  psychological information "conditioning" have had their effect).  This is what people write to me: "When will you finally stop  conducting an antistate policy in the Crimea." But I stand on  the official position of Ukraine!    [Onopenko] You see, it is necessary to take into account  what  is put into these concepts. After all, if it is a question of  broadening some powers of the Republic of Crimea that are  established by its legislative, executive, and judicial organs,  then this phenomenon is normal. But if the question concerns  additional powers of the Republic of Crimea as an autonomous  republic in the structure of Ukraine, then these questions  should be resolved on a legal basis. Therefore, if the Republic  of Crimea had broader powers for the benefit of the residents of  Crimea and in their interests, and I do not rule this out, and,  obviously, it will be necessary to take this path, then this is  a normal phenomenon. I will say only that everything must occur  within the scope of existing legislation and, specifically, the  existing legislation that is in effect in Ukraine. If  contradictions exist between legislation in effect in the  Republic of Crimea and the legislation of Ukraine, then it is  necessary to bring Crimean legislation into conformity with  Ukrainian laws.    [Khmilevskaya] What will be the attitude toward a Crimean  referendum, if one is held?    [Onopenko] I am only the minister of justice of Ukraine, and  I cannot give any guarantees, let alone predict how specifically  the state authorities of Ukraine will treat this. This falls in  the jurisdiction of the Supreme Council of Ukraine. And it must  react in an appropriate way to specific decisions.    But I do know something else. And, unfortunately, I was  unable to meet with President of Crimea Yuriy Meshkov when I was  in the Crimea recently to review the work of the institutions  and organs of justice (we missed each other at the time). I know  that he is a lawyer, and I also am a lawyer, and therefore I  hope that Yuriy Aleksandrovich, as a responsible person to whom  the people entrusted an exceptional amount of authority, and,  first and foremost, I emphasize, as a lawyer, he will respect  the law and will be guided by the laws of both Ukraine and the  Crimea.    [Khmilevskaya] Well, as our great countrywoman said in  difficult moments, "contra spem spero!"--"I am hoping against  hope!" Thank you for the interview.</p>

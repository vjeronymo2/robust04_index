			<p><P> October 24, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SENATE BARELY UPHOLDS BUSH VETO OF RIGHTS BILL  </P> <P> The Senate today upheld by a single vote President Bush's veto of the major  civil rights legislation of 1990, and supporters of the bill vowed to return  next year with an even stronger anti-discrimination measure.  </P> <P> The Senate voted 66 to 34 -- one vote short of the necessary two-thirds  majority -- to sustain Bush's rejection of the bill. The President has vetoed  16 bills, and Congress has failed to override any of them.  </P> <P> All 55 Democrats and 11 Republicans voted to override the veto. Thirty-four  Republicans voted to sustain.  </P> <P> Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.) said the Administration and the bill's backers are  still "very, very close" to agreeing on a substitute measure, and Senate  Republican leader Bob Dole promised a White House Rose Garden signing ceremony  this week if Congress adopts the Administration alternative.  </P> <P> But Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) said the issue is dead for the year and  predicted that Congress next year will pass a "stronger bill" and will have the  votes to override a veto by Bush.  </P> <P> Asked if something could be worked out on the Administration alternative bill,  Kennedy said, "You can't compromise on discrimination, and that's what the  President was trying to do."  </P> <P> The debate prompted a scathing personal denunciation of Bush by Kennedy, who  accused the President of taking "the low road on civil rights."  </P> <P> Kennedy said the veto "contravenes the basic principles for which George Bush  has stood" during his long career, adding, however, "When the chips are down,  President Bush -- like candidate Bush -- is willing to divide the nation for  narrow or partisan advantage."  </P> <P> President Arthur Kropp of People for the American Way, which pushes civil  rights, said the bill was the "casualty of an unrelenting White House smear  campaign," but Kirk Fordice of the Associated General Contractors of America,  said, "I fervently hope that today's action will be the first of many to rid  our society of other quota-inducing laws and regulations."  </P> <P> The legislation, approved by overwhelming majorities in the Senate and House,  would have overturned a series of Supreme Court decisions that have made it  more difficult for women and minorities to prove discrimination in hiring,  promotions and job-related activities.  </P></p>

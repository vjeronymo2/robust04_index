			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina with </F> unidentified domestic correspondents in Cartagena de Indias,  Colombia; date not given; from the "Exclusive" newscast; first  paragraph announcer-read introduction -- recorded]    [Text] Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina has told Cuban  correspondents at the fourth Ibero-American summit that Cuba  believes that it is most important for the summit to maintain  unity, validity, and continuity. Robaina also stressed the  importance of the summit and contacts with other Ibero-American  delegations:    [Robaina] We have highly diverse views, as President Fidel  clearly explained last night. We have no problem with  discussing democracy and human rights. Cuba has much to say  about democracy and human rights. There are many points of  view. If this is discussed at a closed door meeting, we will  make our point at a closed door meeting no matter the subject.  Cuba has its own opinions and views.    [Correspondent] Yet, that discussion has wasted time that  could have been spent on the summit's main issues.    [Robaina] It is not a matter of wasting time that could have  been spent on other issues. Actually, an overloaded agenda  could be wasting the time that could be spent on other issues.  In that sense, the summit has a broader agenda.    No other summit matches this one. Just as we make an effort  to [word indistinct] Fidel's contacts with different presidents  -- such as the presidents of El Salvador, Honduras, Mexico,  Spain, Colombia, and Bolivia -- as well as the other presidents  who are also in the process of bilateral discussions. The  foreign ministries' technical teams, as well as the foreign  ministers, are working hard.    The first two sections of the final draft of the final  document were completed recently. This request, which it now  seems will not be necessary to include, is currently the only  component of this draft. The document is expected to be  approved this afternoon.    When so many presidents gather for such an important  meeting,  it is often the case that we do not have enough time to get to  everything.    [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, do you think the paragraph on  the U.S. blockade against Cuba that was included in the final  document will be altered during the afternoon session?    [Robaina] I do not want to get ahead of myself. That  paragraph has already gone through many processes. I can say  that it is one paragraph that was approved with the least  resistance. That paragraph already exceeds what was  accomplished in Cartagena...[pauses] in Salvador-Bahia.    Participants were asked if they objected to any of the  document's points before it was presented to the Colombian  Foreign Ministry for completion. Not one country objected to  that particular paragraph. That paragraph...[pauses] The  meeting, regardless of yesterday's [words indistinct], is to  improve. Some may even be astonished that we approved the  paragraph and that [word indistinct] the word blockade does not  appear because there seemed to be a problem with its definition.    Some of the people who spoke yesterday have as strong an  opinion on this matter as we do. The great majority of those  present voted in favor of Cuba at the UN General Assembly on  something that is much more significant than this paragraph.  Therefore, I do not think this will mean anything to us. The  rest of the proposals are all included in the document.    The most important thing was for us to have the opportunity  to express our views during the time allotted to us and to have  opinions and points of view on issues that would make way for a  debate and take advantage of the Colombian Government's proposal  of turning this meeting into a real debate rather than the  reading of speeches brought from outside.    [Correspondent] We have heard many opinions by foreign  ministers on yesterday's [word indistinct] by the commander.    [Robaina] Yes, and I believe that you were more surprised  than we were. There are many opinions. Undoubtedly, when one  explains positions...[pauses] For example, I have found many  people who say that issues were brought to the table once and  for all, as they should be. I believe there are those who do  not share his views because they may not feel at liberty,  perhaps, to express the things that our president has expressed.  Undoubtedly, they might be concerned.    Nevertheless, Cuba did not come for the other 22  participants  to share its views unanimously. Cuba has come so that its point  of view is included in the analysis. We have all the authority,  morale, history -- especially our president -- to express our  points of view clearly and plainly. That is very important to  me.    Many people congratulated the Cuban delegation and Fidel  last night for having brought the issues to the table. We will  have to get used to the fact that some will like what we say  while others will not.    We do not say things just to get others to agree. We express  our positions and principles. That is why they have been  expressed with strength. Several people have approached Fidel  to congratulate him on his actions and to say...[pauses] The  best indicator was the room filling up so quickly, unlike  anything else that had happened during the day. There was a  special silence when our president expressed his views.    It is important that you realize that harsh, strong, and  firm  statements such as those will not have unanimous backing from  those who do not want to commit to what we are discussing. We  should not doubt this because the absence of opinions does not  necessarily mean that they disagree. It could also mean that  they prefer not to be publicly sympathetic in light of other  types of pressure. Many public statements have been made on  Cuba's participation in the summit despite all of this.    [Correspondent] Does the final document include the economic  and trade agreements reached at the summit?    [Robaina] The final document includes an important part of  our recommendations. It still does not constitute a true  platform for the integration that should follow. It is  unrealistic to think that the potential for economic integration  that we see in America can be met during just one summit.  Today, the Cuban delegation will be able to present its views  on Cuban reality, how investments are progressing, and how we  are less united and less integrated than ever today. That is  the phenomenon that we face. We will not achieve this kind of  integration with one strong document. We can achieve a stronger  integration if all the presidents and delegations leave here  willing to put these things into action.    [Correspondent] Speaking of these small meetings, perhaps  Cuba can enter the Group of Three easier than any of the other  groups?    [Robaina] Cuba did not come -- people have constantly been  asking me this in the halls -- to seek membership in the OAS or  any other specific regional or subregional group. The fact that  we did not come for that purpose, however, does not mean that we  are excluded. We have not closed the door on any possibility.  Because we do not talk as much about [words indistinct]. We  wish Latin America had a true [word indistinct]. That is what  we want to accomplish. Cuba has not closed the door on any type  of bilateral review with any country, even though at this moment  and in midst of such a complex program you can understand that  we have other priorities.    Economic advancement will allow us to enter into any group  based on the principles that we respect, love, and defend. Cuba  wanted...[pauses] That's why we were dissatisfied last night.  How is it possible for such a meeting to be called and for  Latin America not to have a common position with or without  Cuba? Once again, this demonstrates how, before this meeting,  which we salute and respect, we put aside our participation and  our particular interests as a country.    Many have called to express their satisfaction with Fidel  saying that he salutes the summit with very good intentions and  that he respects the rights of others to have their own  opinions, as some do. This is all that is needed to discuss  true dialogue, unlike what the press, which has been following  us around the hallways, has said, namely that we come here to  express our views and do not accept contradicting views. That  is not true. We accept and listen to anything they want to say.  They, however, must listen to us as well. That is the  phenomenon. Some began talking and thought that no one would  refute those views. Of course not. We spoke yesterday, and we  may have to speak today.    [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, I just want to point out that  everyone praised Fidel at yesterday's news conference. My  question is: Has anyone said anything about the U.S. observers  at the summit?    [Robaina] The matter has not been discussed. We should not  have to address [deshacer] an issue that torments us. U.S.  observers have been mentioned basically because they are  preparing the famous summit. The observers will take with them  what we think of the summit. In other words, why make an issue  of this? In this way, no one has to bring them Cuba's message  on this summit being unnecessary. Cuba is not afraid. They are  here primarily to learn about how to organize a summit. It  seems that this is motivating their presence. I am sure they  have a positive impression of what has taken place here.    [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, the media has been making a  great deal about the commander's attire.    [Robaina] He was asked about this in public yesterday. I do  not believe...[pauses] This generates all the speculation on  whether it is a new style or if it is the beginning of something  new. Let there be no doubt: He will continue wearing his olive  green attire. The fact of the matter is that we are honoring  the summit organizers' request despite response to the uniform  being positive everywhere, including Cuba. We received a  written request for the presidents to dress informally, in a  guayavera or shirt. Our president honored the request, proving  even more that he is not an obstinate man when it comes to  history, a promise, or the olive green uniform. The host  country requested informal dress, and Fidel came informal.    It was big news. Rest assured that he did not do it to make  news and that [words indistinct] in olive green. Although this  left a magnificent impression on Havana, let us not get carried  away. Some have said that it marks the beginning of the end.  If changing Cuba were as easy as changing into a guayavera, we  would have sewn many guayaveras a long time ago.    [Correspondent] The guayavera is a symbol of Cubanism.    [Robaina] Yes, but it is superficial. To those who say that  Fidel is incapable of this or that, there you have it. This  also demonstrates Fidel's ability to adapt to the place, the  moment, and the conditions. Some said this was impossible. The  people in Havana with whom I was talking say they are  traumatized by the guayavera. They cannot wait to see if he  will wear the guayavera in Havana. That is a phenomenon. He is  wearing a guayavera and blue slacks today. Let us not start  describing his socks, etc...[laughs]    [Correspondent] How did Cuba receive Bolivia's statements  following the commander's address?    [Robaina] Many expressed satisfaction with Fidel's address.  Brazilian President Itamar Franco and many others expressed  satisfaction. Fidel's statements were obviously not in  agreement with some of the addresses presented there. If you  review past summits, you can see that many others begin to  publicly express themselves in favor of Cuba, in addition to  those who are concerned and sympathetic toward Cuba. Even  though we are not where we would like to be at the moment, the  number of people who dare speak out is much higher than in past  years.    [Correspondent] [Words indistinct].    [Robaina] Regarding diplomatic relations with Honduras, I  must point out that we do not have diplomatic relations with  three or four of the countries that are present. Nevertheless,  the absence of formal diplomatic relations does not keep us from  having contacts that allow us to talk about our relations even  if they are not diplomatic.    I wish to stress that Cuba is neither preoccupied nor  obsessed nor [words indistinct] steps that have been taken. We  express this to everyone. President Castro himself expressed  that to President Reina today. We do not want the Honduran  people to feel any pressure from Cuba to establish diplomatic  relations because we already communicate with them. Honduras  must determine when conditions are appropriate because on our  side there are no conditions.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The accident which occurred with solid radioactive  waste products being stored on the Pacific Fleet in Kamchatka  was brought under control, the Russian Ministry for Emergency  Situations (RMES) told INTERFAX.    On June 26 two plates encasing a store of solid radioactive  waste sagged as a result of a flash flood. The RMES said that  after experts examined the background radiation it was exceeding  the acceptable level at only two sites.    Before the concrete cover could be restored, the site of the  accident was covered with lead sheets in order to minimize  possible leakage of radiation. The RMES said that the sagged  encasing plates had been changed on June 29. The radiation  background had been normal at that time.    The department for control over radiation security of  military and defense facilities under the State Atomic Control  Committee (Gosatomnadzor) told INTERFAX that the department had  practically no ability to control nuclear facilities under the  Defense Ministry as the Defense Ministry was not observing the  provision on interdepartmental state control.    According to nonofficial information, a high-ranking  official  from Gosatomnadzor said that no people had been affected and  that the environment had not been polluted during the accident.    The same sources said that solid waste of low radioactivity  was kept in the storage facility namely special uniforms, spare  parts and equipment affected by radiation.    This store has received no waste since 1975 and during this  period of time all fast-decaying isotopes had dissociated, the  official said. He stressed that there would never be any  catastrophe with this store of waste.</p>

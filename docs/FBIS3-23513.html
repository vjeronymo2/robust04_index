Filippov under the rubric "Aviainform": "Accident of a  `Stealth'"[.sup]1[/]]    [Text] The new YF-22A fighter suffered an accident on 25  April 1992 at the U.S. Edwards Air Force Base (California)  during plant testing. The ATF program, under which the aircraft  was being developed to replace the F-15, was partially  classified, but for a certain circle of specialists it was no  secret that the work is being conducted in order to create an  advanced tactical air-supremacy fighter. The requirements posed  toward it are also convincing in that regard--high effectiveness  in aerial battle outside of visual contact with the enemy, use  in good and bad weather conditions and in day or night, and  support for double the number of aircraft-sorties per day with a  reduction in support personnel. The aircraft should also have  supersonic cruising speed in non-afterburner engine operating  mode, low detectability and the possibility of being operated  from runways 450--600 meters long.    Lockheed and Northrop, with experience in the development of  the F-117 and B-2 Stealth aircraft, were selected first for the  realization of the project in 1986. After the first flight tests  of the experimental aircraft (the YF-22 and YF-23) in August and  September of 1990, however, the working design engineering for  the pre-series-production aircraft was entrusted to Lockheed.  The firm's product had advantages in maneuverability,  controllability and detectability indicators. The latter quality  was attained thanks to the fact that essentially all of the  achievements of the Stealth technology--low-reflecting shapes,  radio-absorbing materials and electronic-warfare gear, among  others--were employed on the fighter. The radar signature (EPR)  of the YF-22 in some aspects from the forward hemisphere,  according to some assessments that leaked to the press, is about  one percent of the EPR of the F-15. This, in the intent of the  designers, should reduce by 5--10 times the effective range of  missiles against it.    Engines with non-controllable air intakes and flat nozzles  fitted with a system to divert the thrust vector have been  installed on the aircraft. They develop thrust equal to roughly  156 kN in a static afterburning mode. An excellent aircraft by  all measures, whatever one may say. The failure that occurred,  however, has somewhat reduced the optimism of its advocates.    That day, going around after a missed approach, the fighter  unexpectedly dropped to the runway and caught fire after several  cycles of powerful vibrations on the vertical plane. Test pilot  Tom Morgenfeld, even though he sustained burns, was able to get  out of the cockpit in time.    The precise cause of the accident has not yet been  established, but specialists have already advanced a number of  options. The assumption arose that changes in the magnitude and  direction of the thrust vector in afterburner mode of engine  operation could occur. Such a situation had not been studied  before.    U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff General McPeak holds a  different opinion. Insofar as it was established in the initial  stages of study that the stabilizer of the YF-22A has larger  angles of deflection when the landing gear is down than when it  is up, it is namely for that reason that the electronic control  system should be subjected to careful checking. General McPeak  at the same time does not conceal the difficulties in  determining the cause of the accident, owing to the destruction  of a considerable portion of the aircraft during the half-hour  fire. The flight data recorders and the data of telemetric  measurements, all of which remained intact, save the situation.    It has been established that the vibrations of the aircraft  on the vertical plane began after the pilot, when going around,  turned on the afterburner and retracted the landing gear.  Significant vibrations in the stabilizer, typical of the  unsteady operation of the electronic control system, were  recorded at that time. The deflection of the nose of the  aircraft from the trim position reached 20 upward and  5 downward for obviously that reason as well. The landing  was also at an angle of attack greater than that allowed.    Specialists have determined that the speed of the fighter  was  within allowable limits, and no signs of a separation of the  airflow on the wing were observed.    Many, however, feel that the possibility cannot be dismissed  of the consequences of flaws or specific features of the  behavior of the aircraft that had simply not been studied in  this stage of testing. Turning on the afterburner in conjunction  with controlling the thrust vector, for example, had only been  done before at high altitude and, naturally, not during the  process of retracting the landing gear. The possibility of the  appearance of aircraft rocking owing to the imprecise actions of  the pilot with the control stick, which on the YF-22 is mounted  on a side panel and has a range of motion of just three quarters  of an inch form the neutral position, had not been checked out.    Answers to all of these questions would seemingly be  provided  by more profound study, both of this particular incident and by  further testing of the undoubtedly successful craft. As for this  particular copy, it is not subject to restoration, since 20--25  percent of its structural elements were destroyed by fire.    The report of the U.S. Defense Department that this accident  will not entail serious delays in the deadlines for the  completion of testing sounds entirely justified. More than three  quarters of the planned program of test flights had already been  made successfully before it happened, after all, and the  characteristics of the aeroelasticity of the aircraft had been  obtained and the interference of the weapons systems had even  been measured. Data had been obtained even earlier regarding  vibration and acoustic loads on a special aircraft.    The second of the two YF-22 aircraft built, however, is  evidently not suited for flights, and the flight testing will be  able to be renewed only after the building of an experimental  F-22 in 1995.

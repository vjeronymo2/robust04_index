			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POPEYE: JEFFERSON AIRPLANE SET TO TAKE OFF AGAIN  </P> <P> Twenty-two years after the Summer of Love, the Jefferson Airplane is revving up  its rusty propellers and eyeing the pop skies again.  </P> <P> The seminal San Francisco psychedelic band, which hadn't released an album  under its original name since 1973 (the group partially re-formed in 1974 as  the Starship), is going into the studio in a matter of weeks to begin recording  a new album.  </P> <P> "If you'd told me we were going to do this two years ago, I'd have said you  were crazy," said Grace Slick, phoning from Marin County where she was nursing  the flu. "(Co-founder) Paul Kantner and I were still at each other's throats,  and everyone else was pursuing other interests. . . . But time heals all  wounds."  </P> <P> Slick said Airplane members Jack Casady and Jorma Kaukonen, who perform as Hot  Tuna, recently played some dates with Kantner, who in turn invited Slick to a  show in San Francisco. She sat in, singing a few songs, including an acoustic  version of "White Rabbit."  </P> <P> "It was very casual, but we all enjoyed it -- and better still, the audience  seemed to enjoy it," she said. "So we took that as a promising sign." (The only  original member still holding out is Marty Balin, who "might" become involved  as the project unfolds.) Slick said the band has a new manager -- HK  Management's Trudy Green -- and is about to sign a one-shot record deal, with  RCA Records (the group's original label) as a possible contender.  </P> <P> If the Airplane was the enfant terrible of '60s rock outfits, then Slick was  the psychedelic era's most colorful media quote machine. Even in middle age  (she turns 50 in October!) she still displays an appealingly irreverent  attitude toward careerdom.  </P> <P> "Honey, getting this band back together is a mind-boggling procedure," she  said. "For the last four months, we've been making phone calls for three hours  a day, talking to managers and lawyers and accountants and more lawyers, either  trying to infiltrate or extricate ourselves from all sorts of crazy contracts.  </P> <P> "Everyone has all these old ties. Even me. I have to detach myself from the  Starship because we owe RCA one more album." She laughed. "And I own 51% of the  stock in the group so I just can't walk away from it."  </P> <P> In recent years, the Starship had largely relied on outside songwriters whose  material brought the band three No. 1 hits, but little respect. "I'm sure it  was very gratifying for those hotshot L.A. songwriters, but I missed being  involved something terrible," Slick said. "When I started writing again last  summer, I realized how much songwriting meant to me."  </P> <P> Still, it's hard to imagine the Airplane recapturing much of its former glory.  In recent years, a wide variety of oldster bands -- from the Doobie Brothers to  CSN&amp;Y -- have re-formed, with depressing results. "As far as I'm concerned,  we're going for the music," said Slick. "We're not trying to recapture the '60s  -- that would be pretty nauseating. We're not trying to tear down the walls  anymore."  </P> <P> But is Slick comfortable hanging onto her rock identity at 50? "I'm not  comfortable with anything. When I was 25, I made a lot of pronouncements. I  read some quotes I'd made recently and I thought, 'Oh, you fool!' But that's  the beauty of rock. It's still so young as an art form that there aren't a lot  of specific rules -- and you can always break the ones that are there. I don't  feel old at 50. I'd just like another 100 years or so!"  </P></p>

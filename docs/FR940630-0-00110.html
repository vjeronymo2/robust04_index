However, whenever a contract for materials includes the installation of the materials, the contract constitutes a section 3 covered contract. For example, a contract for the purchase and installation of a furnace would be a section 3 covered contract because the contract is for work (i.e., the installation of the furnace) and thus is covered by section 3.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 3 covered project <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  means the construction, reconstruction, conversion or rehabilitation of housing (including reduction and abatement of lead-based paint hazards), other public construction which includes buildings or improvements (regardless of ownership) assisted with housing or community development assistance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 3 joint venture <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .

Section 3(b)(2) of the 1937 Act defines this term to mean families (including single persons) whose incomes do not exceed 80 per centum of the median income for the area, as determined by the Secretary, with adjustments for smaller and larger families, except that the Secretary may establish income ceilings higher or lower than 80 per centum of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the median for the area on the basis of the Secretary's findings that such variations are necessary because of prevailing levels of construction costs or unusually high or low-income families; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> A very low-income person, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  as this term is defined in section 3(b)(2) of the 1937 Act (42 U.S.C. 1437a(b)(2)).

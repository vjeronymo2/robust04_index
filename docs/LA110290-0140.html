			<p><P> November 2, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> Rohr plant in Texas -- A wire service story in the Business section on Tuesday  erroneously reported that a new Rohr Industries plant in San Marcos, Tex., is a  joint venture with General Electric. Actually, the plant is operated by a  wholly owned Rohr Industries subsidiary. The plant's correct size is 168,000  square feet, not 140,000 square feet, as reported by United Press  International.  </P></p>

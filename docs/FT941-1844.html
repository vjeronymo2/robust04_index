			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Underbidders hope for Chilean deal Magma Copper of the US and Broken Hill Proprietary, Australia's biggest company, still hoped to win control of the El Abra project in Chile, one of the world's biggest undeveloped copper deposits, Mr Burgess Winter, the president of Magma, said yesterday. Codelco, the state-owned Chilean copper group, put 51 per cent of El Abra out to tender last year and in October Cyprus Amax of the US with its partner Lac Minerals of Canada, was first past the post offering USDollars 404m and an undertaking to spend Dollars 307m on the project. However, in February, Cyprus and Lac said tests they had made to confirm previous estimates showed reserves at El Abra might be significantly lower than previous data suggested and they might have to renegotiate the deal. Codelco has given them until May 15 to complete. Mr Winter said that, if negotiations between Codelco and Cyprus-Lac broke down, Magma-BHP would press for El Abra to pass to them as the second-highest bidders rather than be put out to tender again. He said Magma-BHP had bid high for El Abra, offering USDollars 240m, some Dollars 10m ahead of RTZ of the UK, third past the post. The gap between the Magma-BHP and Cyprus-Lac bids was explained by the fact that Magma-BHP's test work suggested that El Abra could support annual output of 160,000 tonnes of copper whereas the highest bidders were looking originally for 225,000 tonnes. 'We thought that was impossible,' said Mr Winter. Under the rules Codelco set for the tender, failure to conclude a deal with the highest bidder was to have resulted automatically in the start of negotiations with the underbidder. However, Mr Winter pointed out that Chile's recently-elected new government had changed virtually all of Codelco's senior executives 'so at the moment it is difficult to find someone to talk to'. Some analysts have suggested that the disagreement over El Abra is extremely embarrassing for Codelco as the deal, the first sale of a big ore body by the group, was supposed to set a pattern for other privatisations. It also coincided with revelations that a relatively junior executive had lost USDollars 207m in copper futures trading. Mr Winter, in London to speak to investors, said Magma expected the copper price to reach Dollars 1 a lb by the end of this year against last night's London Metal Exchange three-month price of 88.6 cents.</p>

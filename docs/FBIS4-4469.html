			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 1 KYODO -- The Japanese business  community expressed regret Friday [1 April] at a U.S. threat to  take retaliatory action against Japan and other nations to pry  open their markets for American goods and services. A U.S.  Government report released Thursday accused Japan and other  countries of trade barriers against American goods and services,  warning that Washington might take action against them.    Takeshi Nagano, president of the Japan Federation of  Employers Associations (Nikkeiren), said the U.S. stance shows  that Washington has a "lack of understanding" of Japan's  willingness to be a good partner of the United States.    Kohei Abe, president of the Federation of Electric Power  Companies, said the U.S. accusation was "surprising," noting  that the report argued that the Japanese industry's procurement  from U.S. suppliers was insufficient. Abe said the industry  will continue to purchase necessary equipment in a fair manner,  without discrimination against foreign suppliers.    Kosaku Inaba, chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and  Industry, said Japan should carefully examine the contents of  the report and take necessary steps to avoid possible U.S.  sanctions.</p>

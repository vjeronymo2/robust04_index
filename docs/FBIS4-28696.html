			<p>BFN     [Text] Answering reporters' questions at the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs this morning about news reports that the United  States has sent military officials to provide training for  Cambodian officials, Foreign Minister Squadron Leader Prasong  Sunsiri said the United States is entitled to do so. That is,  he said, because a request may have been made by the new  Government of Cambodia, which is in the stage of national  rehabilitation. The provision of assistance in the form of  training courses or the supply of military uniforms, which is  aimed at making Cambodian officials perfect soldiers, is  acceptable. The practice is the same as Thailand's assistance  to Cambodia in the field of public health and military uniforms,  which were requested by the Cambodian Government. Therefore,  there should be no problem.    On the question of the Khmer Rouge opposing such assistance  by the United States, the Thai foreign minister said the Khmer  Rouge may have been incorrect in their opposition because the  assistance was made in the form of training not arms supplies.    The foreign minister also reiterated that ASEAN countries  have maintained their stances supporting a solution to the  Cambodian problem through compromise and not by supporting armed  conflict.    Regarding the news that Malaysia will provide weapons to  Cambodia, Prasong said he had received no facts nor information  about this and therefore does not want to comment on it.    The foreign minister was asked about the Burmese dissident  students at the Maniloi camp in Rat Buri Province, who are  calling for the rights and freedom of Burmese people and who may  wish to protest the presence of Burmese Government  representatives attending the ASEAN ministerial meeting  scheduled for July in Bangkok. The foreign minister said the  Burmese students, who were placed in the camp provided by Thai  authorities, have lived quite comfortably. Therefore, they  should not make any political moves in Thailand. He thought that  officials and agencies concerned, such as the Ministry of  Interior, should prepare measures to prevent the Burmese  students from using Thai territory to commit illegitimate acts.  Regarding security measures for the ASEAN ministerial meeting  which Thailand will host in July, authorities are believed to  have worked on it and do not think there will be any problems.</p>

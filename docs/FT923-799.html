			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Strains over Europe test Tories' fragile unity THE Conservative Party's fragile unity over Europe came under strain again yesterday as a Commons motion welcoming sterling's departure from the European exchange rate mechanism continued to attract support beyond the more than 60-plus backbench MPs who had already signed it. Dissatisfaction with the government's performance over the past few weeks has even led some senior backbenchers to acknowledge publicly that Mr John Major's leadership is now in the spotlight. Some have also called for ministers to provide more direction and to present, with more style, 'newer and tougher' policies. Sir Marcus Fox, the chairman of the powerful 1922 committee of Tory backbenchers, delivered a thinly-disguised warning, when he emphasised the pressures that Mr Major had been under in recent weeks and expressed the hope that he would be 'refreshed' when parliament resumes its normal session in October. The broad contentment among backbenchers at the floating exchange rate policy was reflected as Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, won a warm reception at a private meeting with Tory MPs for his caution about the prospect of sterling's return to the ERM, as well as for his commitment to a strong anti-inflationary policy. No longer subject to speculation about his immediate future, Mr Lamont used his opening remarks to the meeting to highlight Mr Major's achievement in the general election and to stress how much the prime minister deserved the loyalty of the party. Mr Lamont also signalled yesterday he would use his annual Mansion House speech on October 29 to spell out the monetary framework the government now intends to follow. As party managers welcomed the MPs' support for controls on public spending, fresh evidence of the hard decisions these will mean came as Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, cancelled plans for the new prison service headquarters in Derby. The contract for constructing the building was signed only recently. Yesterday's meeting of the cabinet committee on public spending examined an 'illustrative break down' of the ways in which the Pounds 244.5bn spending target could be met. Earlier, some 70 to 80 backbenchers applauded Mr Lamont as he stressed the need for the government to maintain its anti-inflationary credentials and emphasised the role that tight controls on spending would have in that, especially with sterling outside the ERM. Euro-sceptic MPs claimed that the Commons motion welcoming the 'abandonment of fixed exchange rates' was charting the way forward for government economic policy. Moving to play down talk of division, ministers emphasised the similarity between the terms of the motion and the government's approach as set out byMr Major and Mr Lamont in Thursday's emergency debate. Mr Tony Newton, leader of the Commons, said on BBC radio: 'We are all agreed that we want to see a Europe in which more emphasis is put on the development of co-operation between national governments rather than doing things through centralised bureaucratic structures'. There are signs, however, that the Euro-enthusiasts among the Tories are not prepared simply to concede to the Euro-sceptics the argument over where government policy should be going. In a speech to be delivered today, Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, the foreign office minister, will say that the government would have no truck with the 'political nihilism' involved in tearing up the Maastricht treaty. The Euro-sceptics insist, however, that they all agree not only that sterling should not return to the ERM, but also that the Maastricht should not be ratified. The Euro-sceptic campaigners intend to use next month's Tory conference to press their case. Lord Parkinson, a former Tory party chairman, highlighted the pressure on Mr Major when he warned about the dangers of a 'vacuum of leadership', though he insisted that the prime minister still had 'enormous credibility and support in the party'.

			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Observer: Realms of gold 'Were it not for gold and women, there would be no damnation.' Elizabethan dramatist Cyril Tourneur might have had a point about gold. Timothy Green, a former editor of the Illustrated London News, who this week reissues his book, The World of Gold, reckons that a good many souls have been lost in the cause of gold smuggling. But smuggling is not what it was; once, at least half the world's gold output ended up in smugglers' hands. But Green says they are now being driven out of business by many important markets - such as India - liberalising trade to the point where smuggling is becoming pointless. The nostalgic, though, can still find smugglers who talk of 'a jacket' - rather than ounces - of gold, a reference to a stout canvas jacket, with pockets deep enough to fit 100 bars, or 375 ounces. More practically, today's smuggler usually resorts to internal rather than external concealment; the ideal 'biscuit', or bar, now requiring softly curving corners.</p>

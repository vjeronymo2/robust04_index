			<p><P> February 2, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> QUEEN'S PREGNANT COUSIN MARRIED TO PHOTOGRAPHER  </P> <P> Marina Ogilvy, a close relative of Queen Elizabeth II whose pregnancy out of  wedlock brought the British Royal Family unwelcome publicity, was married today  with the queen's blessing.  </P> <P> The 23-year-old bride, four months pregnant, did not wear a traditional white  dress, and there was none of the lavish spectacle normally associated with  royal weddings.  </P> <P> The private ceremony ended a dispute between Ogilvy and her parents, the  queen's cousin Princess Alexandra and businessman Sir Angus Ogilvy, who she  claimed had cut her off after she became pregnant.  </P> <P> Ogilvy, 24th in line to the British throne, married Paul Mowatt, a 26-year-old  photographer, at a 19th-Century church near her parents' home.  </P> <P> About 100 photographers and reporters jostled outside as the dark-haired Ogilvy  arrived in a rust-colored bolero and mid-calf black velvet dress with matching  hat.  </P> <P> Sir Angus met his daughter with a kiss and asked, "How are you, darling?" She  smiled and he led her down the aisle.  </P> <P> Their embrace signaled the end of a dispute which hit the headlines after  Ogilvy told a newspaper in October that her parents tried to trick her into  having an abortion or marrying by special license.  </P></p>

			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / Gatwick Express to dilute adverts Gatwick Express, the train operating company which runs Gatwick station, is to tone down its advertising and give greater prominence to the activities of competing services following an investigation by the rail regulator, Charles Batchelor writes. Mr John Swift QC, the regulator, said yesterday that he accepted that Gatwick Express was taking 'the appropriate management action' to ensure its staff acted impartially. He will continue to monitor the situation. The investigation was requested by the franchising director, responsible for selling rail franchises to the private sector, to establish rules of good practice before companies moved into the private sector.</p>

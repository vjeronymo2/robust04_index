			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / International Company News: S&amp;P downgrades General Motors STANDARD &amp; Poor's, the US ratings agency, yesterday revised its outlook on General Motors to negative from stable, writes Karen Zagor in New York. S&amp;P affirmed its ratings for the company, including senior debt at triple B plus and preferred stock at triple B. It warned, however, that ratings could be lowered within the next two years unless the company's North American automotive operations improves its financial performance significantly and the liability on the unfunded pension is reduced materially. S&amp;P noted that GM's market share performance has been disappointing in recent quarters. It added that the company's labour contract will not contribute to cost-cutting efforts at GM's core North American automotive operations, as had been expected.</p>

			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Analysts warn about council tax levels AVERAGE council tax bills are likely to be much higher than the government hopes in spite of more stringent controls on local authority spending, according to analysts at Robert Fleming Securities, the stockbrokers. Figures published by Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, suggested that the average council tax bill on a Band D house in England - one valued at between Pounds 68,000 and Pounds 88,000 - would be Pounds 494. Robert Fleming says it could be as high as Pounds 540 as councils boost spending above targets set by the government. The government's suggested local authority spending total for 1993-94 is less than 1 per cent above what councils expect to spend in 1992-93. Robert Fleming says that if spending next year is 3 per cent more than the government's standard spending assessments then the average Band D tax bill in England would be Pounds 540. While many councils will not be able to increase spending by as much as 3 per cent, others will be able to increase it by more than this because their current spending is well below the standard assessments. The government is sceptical about the suggestion that overspending will average 3 per cent more than its assessments. While accepting that there will be some overspend, it says that the current overspend is less than 3 per cent and the limits on capping budgets for the next financial year are tighter than for this year.</p>

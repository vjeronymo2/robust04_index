			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (20): Currencies and the case for intervention / Finance DOES FOREIGN EXCHANGE INTERVENTION WORK? by Kathryn M. Dominguez and Jeffrey A. Frankel Institute for International Economics / Longman, Pounds 14.99 192 pages AFTER THE events in the currency markets in the last year, it is a surprise to come across a book that dares to ask whether foreign exchange intervention can work. It is an even greater surprise to find its authors coming up with an answer that sounds like 'Yes.' There are times in the last 12 months when central bankers in the leading industrial countries must have thought they were in the throes of a hideous nightmare. Most of them have pledged to defend exchange rates within stated or unstated boundaries. Few have succeeded. Concerted intervention failed to stop the dollar falling to new historic lows against the D-Mark in August 1992. Intervention by the Bank of England failed to stop sterling falling out of the exchange rate mechanism the following month. And intervention from the Bundesbank and the Bank of France failed to prevent the effective suspension of the European Monetary System. All that the latter did was to leave the French with a negative reserves position, and the Germans with a fouled-up money supply. But that does not mean that the principle of central bank intervention to support or depress an exchange rate is dead. One forgets all too easily that that late 1980s saw many successful operations by central banks first to depress and then support the US dollar. More recently, the Federal Reserve managed to confound the markets and prevent the yen falling through the Y100 level against the US currency, at least for a while. And, as Kathryn Dominguez and Jeffrey Frankel say in this timely book, central banks do not need huge reserves to outwit the speculators, even if global currency turnover is now at a trillion dollars a day. 'The foreign exchange market is a herd of steers, and central banks are herd dogs,' they write, using an analogy from the American West. 'They bark and nip at the heels of the steers, with the aim of moving the herd in the desired direction.' How, then, can the central banking dogs get the best performance out of the pack? The authors first ask why any governments should want to intervene in foreign exchange markets at all - why the dogs have gone herding in the first place. It is a reasonable question. Leading monetarists have argued that the price of a foreign currency reflects demand and supply in the market. By definition it is the 'correct price.' Any attempt to subvert it ought to be doomed in the long run. Dominguez and Frankel partially concede this point when they say that intervention is unlikely to work when it runs against the grain of prevailing monetary policy. Intervention could not keep the French franc within its former ERM bands because of the perception that French interest rates were too high, given the level of unemployment in the country. Conversely, the recent US intervention to depreciate the yen has only worked because dealers believe that the Japanese government will introduce fiscal measures to stimulate its economy. If Tokyo fails the dollar, the dollar will fall. However, intervention can sometimes be necessary - and succeed - whatever the prevailing monetary policy. The authors believe serious misalignments in exchange rates can occur because of factors which are not related to underlying trade and investment flows - and that central bankers need to respond. They argue that a currency's exchange rate can 'overshoot,' for example, after a change in money supply. In theory, a currency should depreciate by an amount that is consistent with the injection of money into the market. In practice, the currency falls further because international investors are immediately discouraged by the prospect of investing in a currency with lower short term interest rates. Moreover, markets are prone to speculative bubbles which have little to do with fundamental economic data. 'Distressing as it is for economists to admit, many professional exchange rate forecasters and some traders do not base their forecasts on any model based on money supplies or fundamental economical variables,' they say. Instead, dealers use charts to extrapolate past trends in price movements, and this can produce bandwagon effects. These excessive currency fluctuations should worry governments: they make trade relations more uncertain and can destabilise other markets. But what can central banks do to ensure that their intervention is successful? Much depends on the manner in which central banks intervene. Using data released by the German, US and Swiss central banks, the authors discovered that intervention was most effective in the 1980s when the authorities made public statements to the news media, explaining exactly what they were doing. Moreover, if central banks want to manage exchange rates, Dominguez and Frankel think they will have more luck if they operate flexible target zones. 'A target zone is more likely to be sustainable when the central parities are allowed to change over time in line with the fundamentals,' they argue. There, in one sentence, is the epitaph on the ERM's gravestone. The research that has gone into reaching these conclusions is highly detailed. Beware of phrases like 'autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity.' Beware, too, of the algebra that stares from many pages. Nevertheless, the book should be useful to anyone who deals in, or writes about, currency markets. It is a mine of intervention on the intervention policies by central banks in the 1980s. And it traces the main arguments over whether or not to influence exchange rates.</p>

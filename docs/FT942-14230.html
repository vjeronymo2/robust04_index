			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / Accountancy Column: Britain: an audit society in the making  -A critique of an over-dominant approach People who spend too much time trying to measure the volume of smoke end up being consumed by the flames that cause it. Those who gaze too intently at columns of detailed figures lose sight of the wider issues at stake in the organisation they are examining. Since the early 1980s, accountants have achieved a new position in British society more dominant than ever before, applying their skills more widely and, in particular, disseminating in all directions one of their most powerful tools: the audit. From the fairly narrow application of traditional financial auditing, the notion has spread into an ever increasing number of areas in contemporary society. There are: environmental, value for money, data, medical, stress and democracy audits. Entities such as the National Audit Office, the Audit Commission and the European Court of Auditors have all helped to expand the role of auditors. Even after the boom of the late 1980s, about 8 per cent of all university graduates are still being swallowed by the traineeships offered by accounting firms. Britain has become an 'audit society'. This 'audit explosion' is the subject of an important new booklet published today by Demos, the independent think-tank, and written by Michael Power, an academic at the London School of Economics*. Ironically, most other professions - such as teaching, medicine and more recently law - have come under attack and have been forced to change and become more accountable in the last decade. Yet accountants - who are often held in lower esteem than other occupations  -have escaped virtually unscathed. They have received little extra scrutiny, yet all the while their power, influence and income has grown substantially thanks to audit in its widest sense. 'Audit processes have been implicated in the new market culture,' says Power. 'There is enormous blind faith in their benefits. What's really been going on is a massive experiment. It's time to take stock.' In his booklet, he warns that auditing has firmly seized the public imagination and has had a tendency to shift notions of control and accountability from what he calls 'Style B' to 'Style A'. Style B involves qualitative, multiple measures, local methods, autonomy, high levels of trust and 'real time' control. Style A is quantitative, more focused on a single measure, using external agencies, long-distance methods, private experts, and involves little trust. Its approach has become so entrenched and powerful that it is difficult to find an audience for an alternative view. Power sketches out a number of arguments. He says that auditing has involved the spread of a distinct mentality of administrative control, a pervasive logic in which organisations and individuals increasingly come to regard themselves as subjects of audit. While the word audit is used very loosely in many different contexts, he suggests that there is a common thread. It relies on bureaucratic procedures which can be used for independent verification. The documents created by these processes can then be applied outside their original context. Audit is often seen as a series of uninteresting technical and operational practices, but it is also an idea - and one that reflects a certain approach to values and control. He argues that it reflects a shift in concepts of administration and governance, at a time when society has moved from being primarily industrial to being increasingly conscious of the production of risks. The growing dominance of auditing reflects a period when government has withdrawn from the direct provision of services to take on instead a regulatory or supervisory role. The consequence has been a shift in the role of the state from debating broader values towards focusing on more abstract financial and quantitative issues. Power argues that auditing is focused not on primary activities - such as quality - but on other systems of control, such as the mechanisms an organisation has in place to maintain quality. As a result, they provide a more remote level of assurance than many people imagine. It also focuses excessive energy into an abstract 'economy of compliance'. He says that auditing may be driven by demands for greater transparency, but ends up making organisations more obscure. Even when there is extensive public disclosure, it can simply pacify rather than encourage further inquiry. It displaces trust from operatives within organisations and on to auditors. It may in fact spread the distrust it was meant to address, while failing to give power to those it was intended to serve. Power also flags up a 'remarkable' capacity of audits to be invulnerable to their own failure. For example, the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International and the Maxwell empire were 'particularised'. They led to calls for more and better auditing through more detailed rules designed to respond to the particular events. They did not trigger a more general analysis into the limitations of auditing itself. The consequence of all these trends is that there has been growing focus on a narrow set of measurable and controllable factors which represent only a very limited perspective on accountability. 'Efficiency is about measuring outputs compared to inputs,' says Power. 'But what counts as outputs? In so many areas they are difficult to measure, but the tendency is to drift towards a few simple ones. I think we need multiple measures.' Audit has become a dominant influence with little scrutiny, and scant discussion on the unintended side effects such as executive stress, a breakdown in trust and organisational loyalty and a risk that it may be addressing the wrong issues. However, he suggests that audit may well be a passing phase like so many other fashions in management thinking even though at present it seems to be the 'natural' solution to problems. One of the strengths of Power's analysis - and one that makes it stand out from the work of some of his rivals in the small group of social scientists and theorists who have explored auditing - is that he does not start from a negative or nihilistic standpoint towards accountants and their firms. 'I am not interested in conspiracy theories,' he says. 'Accountants can't be blamed for seeking new opportunities, though I do have questions about the absorption of the nation's brightest and best graduates into the audit process.' More generally, his study represents a rare attempt to stand back and question the very notion of auditing and the place it has assumed in society. The price is that anyone reading the booklet has to be prepared to wade through some fairly abstract and theoretical notions often divorced from specific examples. Frustratingly, there is relatively little discussion of alternatives. Power calls for the need to consider a broader range of approaches such as public access to organisations, and whistleblowing. He says he wants to re-establish trust and focus on internal rather than external measures of accountability. But he devotes little space to developing these alternative models. Equally fundamental, he does little to explicitly explore whether and how accountability and control themselves are desirable objectives. As the starting point for a wider debate, it certainly deserves a wide audience. * Michael Power. The Audit Explosion. Demos, 9 Bridewell Place, London EC4V 6AP. Pounds 5.95</p>

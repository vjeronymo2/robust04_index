			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Team Aer Lingus out of examinership Team Aer Lingus, the aircraft maintenance subsidiary of Ireland's national airline, has come out of examinership after its trade unions accepted new work practices. An examiner, the Irish equivalent of an administrator, was appointed to Team Aer Lingus two weeks ago after its parent refused to advance it any more funds following unions' rejection of proposals on more efficient work practices. The unions then reballoted members and the proposals were accepted, leading to renewed support from Aer Lingus for the subsidiary, which lost IPounds 32m on turnover of IPounds 86m last year. Team Aer Lingus has started to re-employ some of the 1,138 workers - out of 1,900 - laid off since the industrial dispute began five months ago. It is not expected to return to profit for at least two years.</p>

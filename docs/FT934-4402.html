			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / International Company News: Shuwa sells stake in Tokyo retailer Shuwa, a Japanese stock and real estate speculator, is to sell its 26.7 per cent stake in leading department store Isetan, built during the Tokyo stock market boom of the late 1980s. The country's retail industry has been closely following developments surrounding Shuwa's stake in Isetan, after leading supermarket operators and department stores wanting to expand their businesses offered to buy the shares off the ailing stock specu-lator. Before its downfall, Shuwa invested heavily in leading retailers - much of which has been bought by Daiei, Japan's largest supermarket chain. Mr Kazumasa Koshiba, president of Isetan, said Shuwa would sell the 58.8m shares to 41 companies at Y1,300 per share. The announcement, made after the market closed, may pull down Isetan's share price, which finished at Y1,780 on the Tokyo stock exchange yesterday. Mr Koshiba said the price was decided on the advice of Nikko Securities, its leading underwriter, and was based on prices of other department store shares. Shuwa will receive Y76.4bn (Dollars 70m) from the equity sale. Of the 41 companies which will take on Isetan stock, three are financial and 38 non-financial. Although Mitsubishi Bank, Isetan's main creditor and shareholder, will not buy any of the shares, eight companies belonging to the Mitsubishi keiretsu, or corporate grouping, will be among the purchasing companies.</p>

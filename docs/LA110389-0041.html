The winner between Dominguez Hills (18-2) and Keene (13-3-2)  will play the winner between host Barry (15-0-2) and Adelphi University of New  York (8-6-1) for the national title Nov. 12. Barry is ranked No. 1 and Adelphi  is ranked 6th.  </P> <P> Keene is very physical, a non-stop team and well-coached, said Dominguez Hills  Coach Marine Cano. "We will have to force them to make key mistakes," he said.  </P> <P> Both Dominguez Hills losses were to UC Santa Barbara, a Division I team.  </P></p>

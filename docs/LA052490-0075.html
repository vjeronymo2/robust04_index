			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE VEGETARIAN: RATATOUILLE IS A VERSATILE ENTREE  </P> <P> Ratatouille is ideal for the undisciplined cook, since it doesn't involve  adhering to a formula. By definition, the dish calls for eggplant, zucchini,  tomatoes, peppers and olive oil, but proportions and seasoning are a matter of  whim. What's more, the dish can be sauteed, stewed or even baked in a terrine,  as follows, then sliced and served warm with soup or salad, or chilled, in a  sandwich.  </P> <P> RATATOUILLE TERRINE  </P> <P> 1 large bunch collard greens  </P> <P> 2 medium zucchini  </P> <P> 4 Japanese eggplants  </P> <P> Salt  </P> <P> 2 shallots, minced  </P> <P> 3 cloves garlic, crushed  </P> <P> 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil  </P> <P> 1 large sweet red pepper, seeded and thinly sliced  </P> <P> 1 large yellow pepper, seeded and thinly sliced  </P> <P> 1 1/2 pounds tomatoes, peeled, seeded and chopped  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons minced fresh basil or 1 teaspoon dried, crumbled  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons minced fresh oregano or 1 teaspoon dried, crumbled  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon fennel seeds  </P> <P> Freshly ground black pepper  </P> <P> 1 1/2 cups fine dry bread crumbs  </P> <P> 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese  </P> <P> 1/2 cup cottage cheese  </P> <P> 1/4 cup milk  </P> <P> 3 eggs, lightly beaten  </P> <P> Cut away stems from collard leaves. Wash greens thoroughly. Steam leaves until  bright green, about 2 minutes. Remove carefully from steamer and set aside.  </P> <P> Slice zucchini and eggplants into 1/4-inch thick rounds. Place in colander and  season to taste with salt. Let drain 40 minutes.  </P> <P> Heat 1/4 cup olive oil in large skillet. Saute shallots and garlic over low  heat until shallots are tender and translucent. Add peppers and saute until  tender. With slotted spoon or spatula, transfer mixture to bowl.  </P> <P> Pat zucchini and eggplants dry. Add remaining 1/4 cup olive oil to skillet.  Saute zucchini and eggplants until tender. Return shallot and pepper mixture to  skillet. Stir in tomatoes, basil, oregano, fennel seeds and season to taste  with pepper. Cook uncovered over low heat, until most of liquid evaporates,  about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.  </P> <P> Line bottom of lightly buttered 8x4-inch loaf pan with collard leaves, allowing  leaves to overlap enough to encase filling. Sprinkle bottom with 1/3 bread  crumbs and 1/3 cheese. Top with half of vegetable mixture. Cover vegetables  with another layer of bread crumbs and cheese, then repeat, layering final  portion of vegetables with last of bread crumbs and cheese.  </P> <P> Puree cottage cheese with food processor or hand beater. Beat in milk and eggs.  Slowly and evenly, pour mixture over layered vegetables. Fold collard leaves  over to encase filling, using additional reserved leaves to cover gaps.  </P> <P> Cover terrine with foil. Place in larger baking pan, adding enough hot water to  come halfway up side of loaf pan.  </P> <P> Bake at 350 degrees 2 hours, checking water level often. Let cool on rack at  least 15 minutes before inverting on platter to serve. Or chill and serve cold.  Makes 6 to 8 servings.  </P></p>

(``PHLX'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' OR ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Currently, PHLX Rule 101, ``Hours of Business,'' provides that the foreign currency option (``FCO'') trading session will be conducted between 1:30 a.m. and 2:30 p.m. each business day. The PHLX proposes to amend PHLX Rule 101 to provide that FCO trading will be conducted between 2:30 a.m. and 2:30 p.m. each business day. Thus, the PHLX will move the opening of FCO trading from 1:30 a.m. to 2:30 a.m. Eastern time (``ET'') for all PHLX-listed FCOs except the Canadian dollar, which will continue to commence trading at 7:00 a.m. ET each business day. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The text of the proposal is available at the Office of the Secretary, PHLX, and at the Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> According to the PHLX, the Exchange's FCO trading hours for the last nine months have commenced at 1:30 a.m. ET each Monday through Friday and terminated at 2:30 p.m. ET on the afternoon of each trading day. The PHLX states that over the past nine months, less than one percent of the PHLX's FCO volume was generated during the 1:30 a.m. ET to 2:30 a.m. ET time period. Upon the recommendation of the Exchange's FCO Committee, a standing committee of the Board of Governors (``Board''), the Board approved the proposed adjustment in trading hours to change the commencement of FCO trading from 1:30 a.m. ET to 2:30 a.m. ET. The proposal is designed to ease the staffing burden on current registered FCO specialist units as well as floor brokerage units and registered option trader firms. The PHLX proposes to implement the adjusted 2:30 a.m. ET commencement of FCO trading on October 31, 1994, to coordinate with the resumption of trading during Eastern Standard time, as October 30, 1994, will mark the end of Eastern Daylight savings time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The PHLX believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6 of the Act, in general, and, in particular, with Section 6(b)(5), in that it is designed to further promote the mechanism of a free and open market and to protect investors and the public interest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The PHLX does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any inappropriate burden on competition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No written comments were either solicited or received at the time of the filing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Within 35 days of the date of publication of this notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period to be appropriate and publishes its reason for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents, the Commission will: (a) by order approve such proposed rule change, or (b) institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV.

			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Global warming pact agreed: UN's draft accord attacked for lack of a binding timetable on emission cuts THE DRAFT of a treaty to curb emissions of greenhouse gases which threaten to change the earth's climate has been agreed by a 143-country United Nations committee. The document is likely to become the centrepiece of next month's Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. The text, approved late on Saturday after long and painful negotiations, should also open the way for the attendance at the summit of US president George Bush, though only at the cost of a weaker treaty than was originally sought. After the agreement, unusually for the UN, delegates broke into prolonged applause, and some left their places to hug and kiss colleagues. But this quickly gave way to streams of criticisms of an accord that many called too weak because it contains no legally binding deadlines. Others denounced it as a product of the collusion of a few industrial powers. The Framework Convention on Climate Change will commit states that sign it at the Earth Summit to limit emissions of gases responsible for raising the earth's temperature. But because of US opposition, and against the wishes of EC members, negotiators failed to agree on clear targets or a timetable to stabilise concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and other heat-trapping gases. Instead, the treaty calls on states to try to hold emissions to 1990 levels while recognising that a return to 'earlier levels' by the year 2000 would advance the main objective. It establishes machinery to review climatic change and advise whether more stringent measures might be necessary. Aid for developing countries to meet its goals would be provided through the Global Environment Facility recently created by the World Bank and other UN agencies, but no amount is specified. Hailing the result as a 'very strong' agreement, Mr Robert Reinstein, chief US delegate, rejected charges of US foot-dragging and compared the American record favourably with that of other nations. 'Europe is frankly in many areas not quite as advanced as the US has been,' he said, adding that the Europeans' stance reminded him of 'our idealism of the 1970s on the environment'. Japan also had not been known as a 'great protector of the environment'. The first sour note after adoption of the treaty was sounded by Malaysia, which said it was 'fundamentally flawed' and Malaysia could not participate in any resolution emanating from it. Environmental groups offered mixed reviews. The World Wide Fund for Nature's Mr Richard Benedick termed it 'a very important first step in a process that is going to take us out of fossil fuels'. But Mr Paul Hohen of Greenpeace International blamed Mr Bush for a meaningless convention that was 'the most expensive ticket to Rio in history'. Editorial Comment, Page 14</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Network Africa" program presented by Max Gerard] </F>   [Text] Lesotho is a tiny mountainous state surrounded by  South Africa, where there seem to be pretty strange things  happening at present. You may recall the interview at the start  of the week on Network Africa, with the country's minister of  natural resources, Monyane Moleleki, who had been briefly  detained and released along with three other ministers by  dissident soldiers. They also shot dead the deputy prime  minister, Selometsi Baholo. Well, it now seems that these  ministers and others may well have left the country for nearby  Botswana. Veronique Edwardes is in Lesotho at the moment, and  on the line to Maseru I asked her what she has been able to find  out about the ministers' whereabouts.    [Begin recording] [Edwardes] The government came out with a  statement saying these ministers had actually left to go to this  country on ministerial duties and will be returning back to the  country as soon as they finish what they were supposed to do.    [Gerard] So, you are saying that the government has now  actually commented on the ministers leaving?    [Edwardes] Yes they have, and this leaves a lot of questions  unanswered, because most people are asking the questions, if  these ministers were supposed to go out on ministerial duties as  the government now has now has come out with a statement to this  effect, why did they leave in such a hurry, and why leave at  night, and why were the officers not informed? Because I went  to most of the offices of these ministers, apparently their  secretaries did not even know that the ministers were out of the  country, and at some point I even met some of the bodyguards of  some of these ministers who had dutifully turned up for their  duties and did not even realize that theirs ministers were not  available.    [Gerard] So, just to clarify, Veronique, are we talking  about  five ministers who have gone to Botswana?    [Edwardes] I noticed about five or six ministers that are  unaccounted for, the minister of natural resources, Mr.  Moleleki; the minister of education, Mr. Mosisili; the minister  of information and broadcasting, Malie; the minister justice,  Mr. Albert Malope; and then the minister of trade, industry and  tourism, who is the brother of the prime minister, Mr. Shakhane  Mokhehle, and the prime minister is away. The minister of  health is away, so you have a skeleton of a cabinet left,  with?three ministers and a junior minister who was just employed  last week.    [Gerard] So, where did the statement from the government  come  from? Who actually made it?    [Edwardes] The information came from the permanent secretary  from the Ministry of Information last evening, and it was very  short, and nobody really expanded more on what he had to say  other than that these ministers were out on official duties and  that they will be returning.    [Gerard] Can you describe first the atmosphere in Maseru at  the moment, given these rather strange goings on, and still in  the aftermath of the shock of the assassination of the deputy  prime minister?    [Edwardes] In the towns and cities people do not care much  as  long as they are not directly by it, or if they are not  personally affected by what is going on. This is what is really  amazing, because on the surface of it, the people look very  docile as if they don't care about what is going on, but deep  down, when you talk to people you would know that they are  worried, they are afraid, they don't know what is going to  happen, and there are so many questions that they would like the  government to answer.

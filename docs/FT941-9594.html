			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / Moscow softens stance on Bosnia air strikes Russia has significantly softened its opposition to air strikes on Serb positions in Bosnia a week before the United Nations deadline for withdrawal of their artillery around Sarajevo expires. Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, said at the weekend that Russia would agree to air strikes - but only 'as a last resort'. He said they would have to be called for by UN forces on the ground and cleared through the security council by Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general. Mr Kozyrev's remarks came after a telephone conversation between President Boris Yeltsin and President Bill Clinton on Friday night, at which - according to the Russian president's spokesman - the two had agreed to 'step up work' with the opposing groups on whom they had most influence. Mr Kozyrev himself talked by telephone on Saturday to Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state. Mr Kozyrev, who had earlier refused to countenance air strikes under any conditions, said on Saturday that he now viewed them as 'conceivable'. Senior US officials emphasised yesterday what Mr William Perry, defence secretary, described as the 'new energy' being devoted to diplomatic negotiations. But Mr Perry conceded that negotiations might take 'months' to come to fruition. Meanwhile, he said Nato was intent on 'raising the stakes' for those who continued to shell Sarajevo after the deadline expires on February 21. The solidarity of the alliance was also a prime consideration in US policy, he added. In a television interview, he said military options excluded the presence of US ground troops but included intensified air strikes if shelling persisted. Mr Perry did not rule out bombing Serbia itself, although he cautioned against 'widening' the hostilities. Mrs Madeleine Albright, US ambassador to the UN, said in another interview there would be 'no extension' of the ultimatum. She conceded that if a settlement were reached, the US remained committed to providing peacekeeping troops. But they would total less than half the 50,000 said to be needed to police any settlement. US embassy families left Belgrade for Budapest yesterday as a precaution against reprisals. British embassy dependants left on Saturday and the Germans are also recommending their embassy families to leave. New hope for Bosnia talks, Page 2 International press review, Page 4</p>

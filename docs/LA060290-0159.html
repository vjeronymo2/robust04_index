			<p><P> June 2, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: REAL ESTATE  </P> <P> Rising in the Ranks: Newport Pacific Development Corp. has broken into the top  rank of apartment builders nationally, placing 10th on Builder Magazine's most  recent list, for 1989.  </P> <P> Newport Pacific started 1,998 apartment units last year.  </P> <P> That, combined with 49 single family units the company began, also earned the  firm the magazine's ranking as the country's 34th largest residential builder  overall.  </P> <P> Many local builders are heading for Riverside, San Bernardino and San Diego  counties to do their thing, but Newport Pacific Chairman Magdy Hanna said his  company did 95% of its work in Orange County last year. Not only that, but,  eschewing the fashionable South County, Newport did most of its work -- 66% of  all the units it started -- in Anaheim.  </P></p>

The taxi filled with commuters was driving slowly  along MC Drive in the East Rand township when the gunmen  ambushed it.    East Rand police spkokesman Lt Deon Peens told SAPA three  men  and two women died inside the vehicle as other commuters fled  the scene. The gunmen kept firing at the fleeing passengers and  several bullets hit the walls and windows of a nearby shopping  centre.    The blood-splattered taxi was still standing at the roadside  by 9am on Friday. Glass was scattered on the scene.    Inside the minibus gym bags, video cassettes and  blood-spattered shoes were scattered across the floor and seats.  The area around the scene was cordoned off by members of the  police Internal Stability Unit.    Lt Peens said more than 50 AK-47 catridges had been found on  the scene. Markers were placed around the spent catridges.    The township was tense on Friday morning and residents  appeared stunned by the shooting after a week of relative calm.</p>

			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> DICK CLARK REVEALS HIS SECRET  </P> <P> Dick Clark has kept the company of millions during his 43 years in broadcast.  </P> <P> But he always plays to an audience of one.  </P> <P> "I visualize in my mind, I learned this from my idols of years ago, that  there's only one person listening or watching and you direct yourself to that  person," Clark said in an interview.  </P> <P> "It's a secret that Arthur Godfrey knew very well, Garry Moore knew very well  -- the pioneers learned that lesson years ago."  </P> <P> On Wednesday, Clark was counted among the pioneers. He accepted membership in  the Emerson Radio Hall of Fame along with Charles Osgood, Paul Harvey, Harry  Caray, Bob Hope and Frank Stanton.  </P></p>

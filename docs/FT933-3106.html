			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / International Company News: American Airlines to cut 5,000 jobs MR Robert Crandall, chairman of American Airlines, underscored continuing cost-cutting in the loss-making US airline industry yesterday when he announced that the company planned to eliminate 5,000 jobs by the end of 1994. The job losses, to come through attrition, early retirement and lay-offs, include cuts of between 200 and 300 managers which the airline announced recently. American currently employs 97,000. Mr Crandall also told an analysts' conference in New York that the company would be grounding 11 more DC-10 aircraft, in addition to 31 it recently grounded. Four would be in 1994 and the remainder in 1995-96. However, it did not expect this to involve any charges against earnings. American's capacity, measured in available seat miles, would be down 4.5 per cent in 1994, compared with this year. Mr Crandall said American would welcome an employee stake in the company. This would presumably be in return for concessions by labour, following the lead set by troubled Northwest Airlines, where employees have agreed to make some Dollars 886m in concessions in return for stock. At United Airlines, labour leaders are considering a buy-out bid for the company which would also involve large cost concessions. Mr Crandall said it would be 'a good thing' if investors and employees in AMR - the parent of American Airlines - were one and the same. However, he added that the company had not been approached by any of its labour groups for a stake in the business. On Monday, the carrier's pilots told analysts that structural problems, not labour costs, had caused the large losses suffered over the past two years. They said the airline should consider modifying the so-called 'hub and spoke' route system which most of the US airline industry uses.</p>

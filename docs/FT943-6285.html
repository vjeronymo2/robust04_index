			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / International Company News: Little reward for a Digital Risc  -US group's link with Olivetti has come unravelled Digital Equipment's decision to sell its 7.9 per cent stake in Olivetti of Italy at a heavy loss should not have come as much of a surprise. Apart from the US company's pressing need to restructure its investment portfolio, the shareholding was the last tangible evidence of a strategy which has failed to work for either company. Digital, once the world's second largest computer manufacturer but now losing money heavily, took an initial 4 per cent stake in Olivetti in 1992 as part of a complex deal designed to give Digital a broader market for its products and provide the Italian company with a financial and technical lifeline. It subsequently increased its holding to 7.9 per cent. Digital first bought 20m Olivetti shares at a premium to the market price in June 1992, and then increased its stake gradually with further market purchases, for a total of Dollars 287.8m. Digital has not specified the price at which the shares were sold during late July and August, although it has had to write down a large part of the investment. Wall Street analysts estimate that the sale of the stake would have raised between Dollars 140m and Dollars 150m. Two years on, it is clear that neither objective has come close to being achieved. There were warning signs that the match was far from ideal. Digital paid more than twice the market price for a share of a troubled company whose hopes of returning to profitability were not bright. Olivetti lost Dollars 297.5m in 1993, and is still struggling. Why? Both companies talk about the broad benefits of a technological and commercial alliance, but the deal was mostly about a single technology - Digital's Alpha microprocessor, claimed to be the world's fastest. The computer industry is changing dramatically. It is moving from mainframe-based systems to new designs based on networks of personal computers and mid-range machines called 'servers', which offer better price performance. The heart of these new client-server networks is a kind of microprocessor, known as reduced instruction set computing (Risc), which is simple and very fast. All the large manufacturers are trying to establish their Risc microprocessor as the standard. For this they need volume sales and have therefore sought alliances with other manufacturers. Sun Microsystems, a leader in Risc technology, has openly licensed its Sparc designs and has an alliance in Europe with ICL, the UK-based company owned by Fujitsu of Japan. IBM, Motorola and Apple Computer are jointly developing the PowerPC, and IBM has underlined a sales agreement with Groupe Bull of France by taking an equity stake in the company. Digital's stake in Olivetti had the same objective. Sales of Alpha technology have not so far met expectations, although Digital says it is beginning to see real growth with some Dollars 1bn worth of Alpha systems sold. Last quarter, it said, sales of Alpha technology outsold its older minicomputer technology and now contribute 39 per cent of its computer systems revenues. Olivetti has not made much of a contribution, however. Although it introduced some Alpha-based workstations and servers in June, analysts reckon that it has sold only a few tens of millions of dollars worth of these systems to date. In Olivetti's defence, analysts say that Digital has failed to establish Alpha as an industry standard, and that it has not become a reference point in the Risc market. More significant, they point out that Olivetti's chief interest in Alpha was to become the heart of its personal computers. Olivetti is the largest maker of PCs in Europe. Digital, however, has decided to use Alpha to power its network servers rather than PCs. Both companies have dragged their feet in the market place. Digital has been slow in delivering essential software while Olivetti discovered that moving its existing customers to Alpha technology would take longer than it had anticipated. What is left of the alliance? As things stand, Digital will continue to buy from Olivetti laser printers, where the Italian company has developed first-rate technology. It will also continue to be Digital's principal supplier of laptop computers. Digital no longer relies on Olivetti for PCs for the European market, although it will continue to buy the Italian machines in small numbers. The two companies have pledged to work together on PC technology. Digital also points out that Olivetti has launched products based on Alpha technology, although it agrees that sales, at an early stage in the product cycle, are insignificant. Digital has substantial cash, inherited from its successful years in the late 1980s. Does it need to raise more money? Probably not in absolute terms, although it still has substantial restructuring charges to meet. But its senior executives have to be seen as putting their house in order. Talks with Oracle Systems, a database company, about the sale of Digital's database software, are thought to be close to a conclusion. The sale might raise a further Dollars 100m or so. What effect will the loss of Digital as an equity partner have on Olivetti? It says it is not looking for a single large partner but is prepared to consider several smaller alliances in areas, such as telecommunications and multimedia which it has identified as its best opportunities. The Digital-Olivetti deal is the first of the Risc alliances to come unravelled. It remains to be seen whether the others will prove more stable.</p>

			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Observer: Clearing Kavan Jan Kavan can afford to smile again; he has been officially cleared by a Czech court of the charge of collaborating with the StB, communist Czechoslovakia's equivalent of the KGB. In March 1991 a parliamentary commission said Kavan's name had been found in StB files. Kavan had been a famous dissident, indeed the opposition's main link with the west, while he lived in exile in London between 1969-89. The accusation was based on meetings he had in 1969-70 with an StB agent based in London's Czechoslovak embassy. The ministry of interior says it will appeal against the latest judgment, though Kavan is confident there is no further evidence. He is now standing unopposed for the chairmanship of the Czech Social Democratic party foreign affairs committee - effectively making him shadow foreign minister.</p>

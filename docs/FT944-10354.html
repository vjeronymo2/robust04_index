			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Strasbourg delays change of guard in Brussels The European parliament has forced a delay in the inauguration of the new European Commission until late January, it emerged yesterday. The delay means that Mr Jacques Delors will lead a caretaker regime probably until the last week of January, some three weeks after he was due to step down as Commission president. One unexpected result is that he will have a cast-iron excuse for remaining silent about whether he intends to run for the French presidency in late spring. Most observers believe this will help Mr Delors, whose high standing in the polls is attributed partly to his absence from an increasingly messy battle for the Elysee. The immediate impact, however, is that next week's planned Euro-parliamentary hearings to screen the new 21-member Commission are to be postponed until the first two weeks in January. The Strasbourg assembly is expected to vote on whether to approve the full Commission, including Mr Jacques Santer, the new president, on January 18. The hold-up is the result of a judicious muscle-flexing exercise by Mr Klaus Hansch, the new president of the assembly. It underlines his determination to use the leverage over the Commission and the member states offered by the Maastricht treaty, one of whose powers is to give Strasbourg the right to approve or reject the Commission as a whole. During legal exchanges, the parliament insisted that the new Commission must be endorsed by an assembly drawn from all member states, including Austria, Finland, Sweden, and Norway. All four countries are due to enter the European Union on January 1, assuming that voters in Sweden and Norway approve EU membership in referendums this month and the accession agreements are ratified by all 12 member states. The parliament argued successfully that MEPs from Austria and the three Scandinavian states - who are temporarily designated by their national parliaments pending Euro-parliamentary elections scheduled for next year - would have no legal status until January 1 when enlargement takes place. The hold-up is something of a blow to Mr Santer who had hoped to get off to a fast start with the new five-year Commission. Late last month, against expectations, he succeeded in allocating portfolios to the new commissioners with a minimum of controversy. More broadly, the parliamentary delay is part of an institutional logjam which also threatens to delay ratification of the EU's five-year budget. Member states were due to enshrine the spending plans into domestic law by the end of the year, but a combination of weak governments and political opposition in national legislatures could hold up passage.</p>

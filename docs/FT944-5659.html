			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / The FT Interview: Game player of the right - Gianfranco Fini It takes a chess player to en-hance his reputation during political turbulence. And with a game in progress on a large chess board by his office desk, Mr Gianfranco Fini is as dedicated a player as one is likely to find in the Berlusconi government. The 42-year-old leader of the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance, a key partner in Italy's rightwing coalition government, is playing the long game: cleverly, strategically and with a cool nerve. He plans to be the leader of the Italian right. His immediate mission is to gain respectability for the MSI, long treated as the pariah of Italian politics because of its identification with the fascism of Mussolini. Always affable and immaculately neat, Mr Fini thrives on politics. He came to prominence last year, when he narrowly lost the fight to be mayor of Rome. His party has since moved into the mainstream thanks to its alliance with Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and his Forza Italia movement. It has also begun working on a new identity. In January it will drop its Italian Social Movement (MSI) label, and retain only the less emotive National Alliance (AN) adopted earlier this year. 'The right in Italy has always been linked to fascism, which itself is an Italian phenomenon. The MSI grew out of fascism,' he says. But he describes himself as a post-fascist, and says: 'I'm trying to reposition the party to be the new right, but certainly not by linking it to fascism.' Nevertheless, Mr Fini faces serious problems in marginalising the hardliners who control much of the party organisation, especially in the south. Several still use the fascist salute, and have made no efforts to distance themselves from the hooliganism of nazi skinheads. He has been urged to force these elements out, rather like the former communists who created the Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) and left the hardline rump to establish its own party, Reconstructed Communism. But Mr Fini takes a more pragmatic view. 'Some activists will certainly leave' when AN is formally inaugurated, he says. 'But I don't think they would form another parliamentary party . . . If the proportional voting system had remained, this might have happened, but I think the new majority voting system forces the formation of large groupings - rassemblements - that contain often widely differing views.' Mr Fini claims it was the need to transform his party and explain it to the electorate that led him to refuse a ministerial position in the government. 'It may sound presumptuous but, if I hadn't decided to dedicate many hours of the day to this problem, it would be more difficult to end the existence of the MSI and give birth to the AN.' He omits to mention this also allows him to keep his hands clean and plot from outside. Mr Fini and his party, with 12 per cent of the national vote, have become an essential prop for Mr Berlusconi, providing much of the government's political knowhow. The MSI has also been astute in occupying key administrative positions in government, state entities and state companies. In so doing, the coalition has been pulled away from the centre to the right. With his support base in the south, where the MSI picks up as much as 20 per cent of the vote, Mr Fini is concerned that the government's policies 'must not have a negative social impact' on the region. He insists he does not share Mussolini's corporatist view of the state, and endorses privatisation and the winding up of IRI, the giant state holding company created in the 1930s. But he is concerned that jobs are not lost in the south. 'Voters don't want state hand-outs; but they want the state to put in the essential infrastructure and services, and ensure that business can compete on the same conditions as in the north. This means combating organised crime, ensuring the cost of borrowing is the same and that the transport system works.' Mr Fini recognises that he could extend his support if Mr Berlusconi falls, by inheriting a slice of the Forza Italia electorate. But the situation is double-edged. With Mr Berlusconi gone, no one else might consider Mr Fini an acceptable ally, and he could be marginalised. He wants the embattled coalition with its five MSI ministers to survive. 'This is the only viable government: if it falls we will either have to find another government within the existing parliamentary majority or hold fresh elections.' He thinks it unlikely the coalition can be enlarged. 'It can only move towards the Popular party (which contains the bulk of the former Christian Democrats) - but this is split between those ready to ally with the right and those who want to go to the left.' Mr Fini does not mince his words about the third partner in the coalition government, the populist Northern League, which he describes as 'an indispensable but at times impossible ally'. 'Either the League reaches an agreement that allows the government to govern, or it leaves the coalition and there is a crisis.' He reckons Mr Umberto Bossi, the League's leader, may seek to leave the coalition in January once the 1995 budget is approved. He sees the fact that Mr Berlusconi is under investigation for corruption as a lesser issue. 'The threat of him being under investigation has been there since the first day of the government; now that this has happened, the negative impact has already been absorbed. 'Besides, the main flank on which he has been attacked was his dual role as businessman and prime minister. This he is now resolving and the high point of the polemic has passed.' Whatever the fate of the government, Mr Fini sees a period of political instability ahead. 'Italy is on its journey from the first to the second republic. We are in the middle of the river . . . I hope there are no piranhas,' he says with a laugh, knowing that he may be one of them.</p>

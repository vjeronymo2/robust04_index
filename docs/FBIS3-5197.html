			<p>Language: <F P=105> Vietnamese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [First of three installments of an article by Political </F> Bureau member Vu Oanh: "Great National Unity in the New  Situation and Tasks"]    [Text] On 17 November 1993, the Political Bureau issued a  resolution on promoting great national unity and strengthening  the unified national front. Keeping the entire party and people  thoroughly informed of the essential points of this resolution  and transforming the resolution into life now constitute an  urgent and essential demand.    Great national unity is a highly valuable tradition our  people have followed during their history of national  construction and defense. The Political Bureau resolution says:  "Taking up and developing this tradition right from its  founding, our party has always paid attention to strengthening  and broadening the universal national unity bloc; developing  national strength; and combining national strength with  international, traditional, and contemporary strengths. It is  because of this that the party won many great victories during  the struggle for the independence of the fatherland and the  freedom and happiness of the people.    It is thanks to the promotion of great national unity during  the struggle for national independence, construction, and  defense that our party -- since assuming its leadership role  over a half century ago -- has led our people to one victory  after another. Yet this tradition has not been promoted in  certain localities and at certain times. This is why the  revolution has had to cope with many difficulties. This is the  lesson learned from the reality of the revolution.    If we are united, we will be able to overcome any  difficulties in any revolution, regardless of how hard they may  be. If we are divided, we will go bust. This is a great lesson  of experience that is illustrated by the following quotation by  Great President Ho Chi Minh: "Unity, unity, great unity;  success, success, great success."  <H6>  Part One </H6> <H3>  The Party's Renovation Policy and the Great National Unity  as Seen in the Past </H3>   In the situation where the party is the ruling party, its  role in the great national unity bloc is a decisive factor.    Since the liberation of the south and the unification of the  country, our country has been faced with a profoundly changing  domestic and world situation. This has created new  opportunities and new challenges in the cause of defending the  Vietnamese fatherland.    Under such circumstances, our party has enjoyed great  advantages. As noted in the resolution of the eight party  Central Committee's eight plenum: "Founded and trained by  President Ho Chi Minh, the Communist Party of Vietnam led our  people to fight as a united body. This made it possible for the  August Revolution; the war of resistance for national  independence, freedom, and unification; and the struggle for  national construction and defense to achieve successes and  become successful.    "These achievements were the result of the following  factors:  The party had a correct political line. It had support from the  people and a contingent of party cadres and members who, during  the fight, associated themselves closely with the people.    "The close relationship between the party and the people has  become a source of strength and a very valuable tradition of the  Vietnamese revolution."    Entering the new revolutionary stage, the party has promptly  detected and corrected the mistakes in its political leadership.  Only a few years after the liberation of the south and the  unification of the country, the sixth party Central Committee's  10th plenum, held in October 1979, criticized the system of  bureaucratic and subsidy-based centralism. It advocated  building a multi- component economy, with South Vietnam having  five economic components, to enable production to flourish from  the grass roots.    Based on the guiding thought of the party Central  Committee's sixth plenum resolution, the party Central Committee  (fourth and fifth terms) has formulated a series of lines and  policies aimed at fulfilling various set tasks. These include  Directive No. 100 on the end-product contractual system for  laborers in agricultural cooperatives (January, 1981); Directive  No. 35 on implementing and developing the family economy;  Directive No. 29 on allocation of land and forests to  cooperatives and households; Directive No. 65 on developing the  sea and coastal economy; Government Decree No. 25-CP on granting  autonomy to state-run enterprises; and so forth. Afterward, the  sixth and seventh national party congresses set forth new,  fundamental, and comprehensive lines and policies to build the  market-based multisectoral economy under state management and  expand and diversify diplomatic activities. This was followed  by party Central Committee Political Bureau Resolution No. 10 on  renovating the management mechanism for agriculture, and many  other resolutions of the sixth and seventh party Central  Committees. All of these are aimed at consistently carrying out  the renovation process from the higher down to the lower levels,  in order to unleash the labor force and further strengthen the  people's right to mastery.    In implementing the renovation process, at certain times we  have faced acute difficulties within the party as well as among  the people. We have also experienced clashes between the  conservative and renovation concepts. Because our people's  creativity and dynamism -- especially that of the peasants --  has been condensed and formulated into national lines and  policies by our party, however, we have overcome numerous  difficulties and ordeals. We have also been able to combine the  "party concept with the people's feeling," thus creating a  vigorous driving force for developing the rural areas and  agriculture and resolving the most fundamental issues; namely,  the peasants' rights to use the land and the laborers' rights to  ownership in production and distribution. This has motivated  tens of million of peasants to participate in the implementation  of party policies for their own benefit, thus revitalizing the  potential of land and labor, promoting our people's diligent  characteristics, and producing remarkable economic results.    For instance, the grain shortage and the import surplus were  two acutely difficult issues that we failed to overcome, despite  great efforts over many years. Yet since early 1981, the first  year we implemented agricultural renovation, we have achieved an  unprecedented pace of development in this regard.    The gross grain production output during the 1976-80 period  was 13.3 million tonnes, an average increase of 200,000 tonnes  annually. During the 1981-88 period, however, gross grain output  was 17.5 million tonnes, an increase of 810,000 tonnes. During  the 1989-92 period, the output was 22.2 million tonnes, an  increase of 1.5 million tonnes, while gross grain production  output in 1992 and 1993 was 24.5 million tonnes annually. The  export value also increased from $700 million during the 1976-80  period to almost $2 billion at present.    The rapid increase in grain production output and export  value has created favorable conditions for other economic  sectors. Animal husbandry, industrial crops, forestry, and  maritime products have developed remarkably, thus stabilizing  and improving people's daily lives, especially in rural areas.  This has contributed to helping the country overcome very  dangerous ordeals while consistently implementing the renovation  process.    Against the background of the complicated international  situation that greatly effected global stability, the United  States continued its trade embargo against our country. After  the war, our country faced numerous difficulties as a result of  its consequences. We also experienced difficulties caused by  past mistakes in formulating our lines and policies. As a  result, our renovation undertaking calls for efforts to overcome  difficulties while correcting our mistakes. We have,  nevertheless, made the abovementioned achievements. This is  testimony to the fact that our party's renovation line is  correct and our revolution is advancing in the right direction  of maintaining national independence and ensuring freedom and  happiness for our people in accordance with the socialist  orientation.    Our country, however, is still rife with many difficulties  and shortcomings.    As far as the socialist reformation and construction process  is concerned, our party committed mistakes due to haste,  dogmatism, and voluntarism. It did not pay due attention to the  laws governing the formulation of action programs, failed to  take into account the fact that ours is an agriculturally  backward country with a predominantly small-scale production,  and belittled efforts to make use of the strengths created by  the tradition of great solidarity to formulate correct policies  and lines. Prompted by the desire to quickly get rid of all  other economic sectors, including the individual economic  sector, and retain only the socialist and semisocialist economic  sector, it eliminated a substantial number of talents and  inviduals with wisdom and skills who can be used to serve the  national construction and defense goals.    In implementing the party-initiated renovation line, our  people have scored initial yet very important results.  Nonetheless, the national economy still depends entirely on  agriculture. The scale of industrial production remains small,  and material and technical bases are not enormous in size. The  level of economic efficiency is very low. There still remains  enormous budget overspending and substantial foreign debt. Many  people are unemployed or underemployed. Corruption, smuggling,  and extravagance continue to develop seriously and in a  complicated manner.    Only slow efforts have been made to renovate the state and  cooperative economies. Though the private economy has  developed, its growth rate is not high enough. The lives of the  people, especially ethnic minority people in high altitude  regions and remote areas, are still rife with many difficulties.  The pace of renovation and consolidation of the political  system is slow. Party members and the people still do not  display a truly firm ideological stance. The situation  concerning political stability and social security and order is  not good.    Our nation is still listed as one of the poor countries in  the world. The gross domestic product per capita is much lower  than that of many countries in the region, and the average  annual growth rate is even slower. The danger of lagging  further behind compared to many countries in the region has  exerted an adverse impact on employment, living conditions, the  people's confidence in and support for our regime, and national  security and defense capabilities... Meanwhile, many hostile  forces are trying by all means to undermine our people's  revolutionary undertaking.    Over the recent past, our party has made due efforts to  resolve social problems. Nonetheless, there are still many  shortcomings and difficulties which, in turn, have exerted a  not-too-slight impact on the people's idelogical and political  singlemindedness. Now that the national economy has effected  changes for the better and the new mechanism has created  favorable conditions for resolving social problems, let's ensure  social justice through the distribution of production means and  let's combine this move with efforts to adjust the income  distribution system. It is necessary to create conditions for  everyone (by means of land allotment, selling of shares,  contracting, bank loans...) so they can earn their living,  enrich themselves, and bring about prosperity in society.  Nonetheless, economic development and the application of a new  mechanism alone cannot provide solutions to all problems. We  should try to resolve social problems according to the party's  policy on human resources development under which the human  factor is regarded not only as the target of but also the motive  behind the national defense and construction cause. At the same  time, we face a series of major social problems that have  reached an alarming level both in the short and long terms.  They include the deterioration of educational, public health,  and cultural services and the growing development of illiteracy,  school dropouts, diseases, moral degradation, corruption, and  smuggling, thereby causing our efforts to cope with challenges  to become more difficult and complicated.    Given the new development stage of the revolution, the  party's leadership skills, the political background and  singlemindedness of all party members, and the moral ethics of  cadres and party members constitute the preliminary conditions  for rallying the entire people around the party.    Thoughout history, our party recorded a very glorious  achievement by providing leadership for national liberation and  fatherland protection. In recent years, the party has quickly  initiated the renovation line and led the reform undertaking,  gaining important initial victories. However, in the new  situation, it has shown weaknesses in keeping par with the  revolution's current requirements. Moreover, the government's  management role from the central to local and grassroots levels  governments has been far too low for the demand, despite its  successes in building a law-governed state of the people, by the  people, and for the people; in enforcing the law; in improving  foreign affairs work; and in controlling inflation and prices.    Mass organizations have been relatively quick in developing  their economic, scientific, social, and professional  associations to meet the new situation and duties. Traditional  organizations have exerted many efforts to broaden democracy and  reform their structure and working methoda. They, however, are  still more or less in a vicious circle of stagnation,  inflexibility, and disparity, especially at the grassroots level  where the systems of mass organizations have not really been  integrated and taken root in the grassroots and the public....    Since the party became a ruling party in the entire nation,  particularly since the country entered its renovation, the  socioeconomy has been moving and progressing very quickly;  international relations have been changing; the party's contact  with current affairs and social realities has not been renovated  quickly and accordingly; and the political and moral degradation  in some cadres and party members has brought about serious  effects to the party's fighting spirit and reputation. The  party has not thoroughly understood the people. The people have  not really become attached to the party. Lower level cadres do  not dare tell the truth to higher cadres. The atmosphere of  democracy and fair discussion to discover the truth has been  limited. The principle of democratic centralism, which is the  party's vitality, has not been maintained. The practice of  bureaucracy and authoritarianism has existed together with the  devils of indiscipline, sectionalism, and clannishness. In many  places, the party's internal fighting has been very weak and the  clarification of correctness and incorrectness has been  prolonged to an extent that clarification becomes impossible.    If the party, state, and mass organizations do not improve  their knowledge and if their management is not corrected to make  them cleaner and stronger, there will be difficulties in  gathering the intellectual essence from the party, the national,  and the current world, leading to the weakening of their  attraction to the public.    This situation arises for different reasons. But the most  fundamental reason that needs to be clarified and corrected is  that the party has not been absolutely correct in defining its  relations with the national political system and with society in  the new revolutionary condition, situation, and duties.    From a party of the workers' class leading the revolution to  seize power and protect the government, our party has become a  ruling party in the entire nation. It is leading the  undertaking of national construction and protection in a  multisectoral economy with a market mechanism with state  management; with the government of the people, by the people,  and for the people; and with the broadening and diversifying of  multilateral international relations. This special  characteristic requires the party to combine the strength of the  workers' class with national strength, national strength with  international strength, and traditional strength with temporary  strength. The liberation of the workers' class must be preceded  by national liberation. The settlement of sectional interests  must be in harmony with national interests. The party's goal  and duty must be the goal of all society as well.    Therefore, the party must be renovated. The party must lead  the revolution. It must be a party of the workers' class and  represent the interest of the workers' class and the national  interest. It must be the vanguard team of the workers' class  and the nation as well (with no sexual discrimination and not  standing above the nation). It must place national interest  above everything else to unite people of all strata and  religions for the implementation of President Ho Chi Minh's  spirit of the great national unity and to create a strong force  for "the construction of a Vietnam of peace, unification,  independence, democracy, and prosperity" (from President Ho Chi  Minh's Testament).</p>

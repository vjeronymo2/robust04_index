			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> EL SEGUNDO, UPS BATTLE OVER PROPOSED FACILITY;  </P> <P> TRAFFIC: CITY RETRACTS APPROVAL OF NEW SITE AFTER STUDY PREDICTS GREATER-  THAN-EXPECTED CONGESTION.  </P> <P> In a dispute clouded by possible litigation, El Segundo and United Parcel  Service are at odds over how much new traffic a proposed UPS facility will  bring to an already-congested industrial and office park east of Sepulveda  Boulevard.  </P> <P> After Chevron USA Inc. subdivided undeveloped property in the park three years  ago, UPS bought 23.7 acres for a $35-million facility to serve its growing  South Bay and Westside business. The purchase for an undisclosed price was made  after the El Segundo Planning Commission concluded that the already-busy area  could handle 2,604 daily vehicle trips in or out of the UPS center.  </P> <P> But after a later environmental impact report on the facility postulated daily  traffic at the 5,310-trip level, the commission balked. Last January, it denied  the UPS project, despite a UPS offer to institute such traffic reduction  measures as employee ride-sharing.  </P> <P> "The traffic volume was unacceptable," said Kendra Morries, city planning  manager.  </P> <P> In a sometimes-testy appeals hearing before the City Council last month, UPS  offered a legal guarantee to keep its traffic below the 2,604 daily trip level  or pay fines for the excess. Arguing that the project meets all laws and  conditions controlling the Chevron subdivision, UPS attorney Maura O'Connor  said city approval is required. If it is not, she said, UPS "has to pursue  legal remedies."  </P> <P> Although the matter remains unsettled pending completion of new traffic studies  by both sides, Councilman Scot Dannen said negotiation is difficult under what  he termed a "give-it-to-us-or-else" legal threat.  </P> <P> Dannen termed the UPS legal posture "a cheap act of terrorism."  </P> <P> Jim Passolt, UPS regional real estate manager, characterized the flap with the  city as a "misunderstanding and miscommunication" that the company is working  to reconcile without litigation.  </P> <P> However, City Atty. Leland Dolley said he has received a preliminary document  from UPS attorneys challenging the city's ability to reject the project. UPS  officials refused to comment on the document.  </P> <P> The traffic dispute focuses not only on the widely varying average daily  traffic projections, but also on the impact of the UPS center on streets and  major intersections during peak morning and evening driving time.  </P> <P> UPS presented its traffic guarantee based on a 24-hour period, but the council  has labeled this meaningless without knowing when the greatest amount of  traffic will occur and what that volume will be.  </P> <P> Councilman Alan West said he can visualize hundreds of brown UPS vans on the  road. "If it happens at 2 a.m., OK, but if it all happens at 7 a.m., we're in  trouble," he said.  </P> <P> Councilman J. B. Wise said he is concerned about not only peak-hour traffic,  but also about the size of the UPS vehicles. In addition to its familiar large  brown vans, the company uses tractor-trailers for major customers.  </P> <P> The city traffic engineer and UPS are surveying selected UPS facilities  comparable to the proposed El Segundo center to determine when -- and to what  extent -- most traffic occurs. Another council session on the UPS issue is  scheduled for July 17, when the study results are expected.  </P> <P> According to the city and UPS, the proposed El Segundo facility -- which would  be next to the long-established golf driving range on Sepulveda -- will have  749 employees, along with 300 vans and 20 tractor-trailers for delivery of  parcels and documents.  </P> <P> David Shockley, UPS real estate representative, said vans and trucks will leave  in staggered fashion between 8:30 and 9:15 a.m., returning between 5:30 and 7  p.m. He said average daily traffic -- including vans and trucks, employees and  customers -- is not expected to exceed 2,529 trips. Most would occur between 6  a.m. and 7 p.m. (A trip is defined as a movement in or out of the facility; the  movement of a tractor-trailer counts for two trips.)  </P> <P> To lessen the traffic impact, he said, UPS vehicles will avoid congested  intersections and will operate a satellite customer facility during the holiday  package rush.  </P> <P> UPS officials have criticized the environmental impact report that projected  the center would generate 5,310 daily traffic trips as greatly exaggerated.  </P> <P> The projection was based on operations at the company's Anaheim office, which  was included in a list of facilities comparable to the proposed El Segundo  center that UPS gave to the city. But Passolt, the UPS regional real estate  manager, said that in doing the report, the city failed to take into account  that Anaheim is a district facility with a larger customer counter and more  employees.  </P> <P> City Manager Ron Cano said UPS did not challenge the environmental report when  city officials certified it. But Shockley said UPS sent a letter protesting the  count, which was attached to the report.  </P> <P> UPS said that with its business growth, the El Segundo center is needed to  reduce trip lengths and augment overcrowded Gardena and West Los Angeles  facilities that serve the area.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 10, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / INSURANCE COMMISSIONER;  </P> <P> WILL SEND QUESTIONNAIRE TO CANDIDATES, NADER SAYS  </P> <P> Consumer advocate Ralph Nader said Monday that he will send a questionnaire to  every candidate in the race for California insurance commissioner at the end of  this month and by May 12 make public the answers, along with his own  comparative scoring of them.  </P> <P> "The questionnaire will not be a very conventional one," Nader said. "It will  be a detailed series of questions to determine what the candidates' various  positions are, how they view the role of insurance commissioner and to what  degree they are prepared to enforce Proposition 103. . . . If they say, 'who  the hell am I to send out such a questionnaire,' then they ought to be aware of  the thousands of Californians who are asking me how they should vote in this  contest."  </P> <P> Nader's sponsorship of Proposition 103 in 1988 was credited in many quarters  for being highly influential in the insurance reform measure's narrow victory.  </P> <P> Indicating that he would make no personal endorsement in the race, Nader  declared in an interview: "The results of the questionnaire, the scores given,  will speak for themselves."  </P> <P> Nader, speaking from his organizational headquarters in Washington, said he  will make public all the questions, all the answers and how he scored each  answer, thus affording Californians the possibility of deciding for themselves  whether he had been fair in scoring the candidates.  </P> <P> In Monday's interview, Nader was critical of one leading candidate in the early  polls in the crowded race for the Democratic nomination, state Sen. John  Garamendi. And he was noncommittal on another candidate, television commentator  Bill Press, who over the weekend received the official endorsement of the  state's Democratic Party.  </P> <P> Nader said he is convinced that when Garamendi's voting record as a legislator  becomes known, it will become clear that, by backing limits on medical  malpractice and other lawsuits, Garamendi had frequently done "what the  insurance industry wanted him to do."  </P> <P> As for Press, he said: "He's sort of Mr. Bland so far. There are two things we  have to ask about him, or any candidate, for insurance commissioner: what he  believes in, and what determination and guts he's going to bring to the job."  </P> <P> A spokesman for Press said he would answer Nader's questionnaire. A spokesman  for Garamendi had no immediate comment.  </P> <P> In any case, Nader added, it is premature to predict a winner. "There's a huge  undecided, and we're not down to the nitty-gritty yet," Nader said. "The  campaign is going to heat up. . . . The issues will be joined. Right now,  everyone's blowing his own horn without anything but an echo."  </P></p>

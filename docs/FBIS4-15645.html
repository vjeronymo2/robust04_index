The State Duma  received a statement signed by STOLITSA magazine journalist  Aleksey Pyatkovskiy, whose dictophone and glasses were broken  and trampled upon by Zhirinovskiy. State Duma Chairman Ivan  Rybkin instructed the committee on the internal organization of  the Duma to investigate the incident. Rybkin stressed that he  would personally hand over the journalist's statement to the  bodies of the democratic state which is being formed together  with the State Duma.    [Announcer] When asked by our correspondent where the  Chairman of the State Duma would send the assaulted journalist's  statement, the State Duma chairman said:    [Rybkin] I will definitely -- it is my duty -- pass the  paper from your colleague Pyatkovskiy to the procurator general.</p>

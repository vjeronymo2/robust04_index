			<p>Language: <F P=105> Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] For 30 years, the Cambodian nation and people, like  the peace-loving countries worldwide and especially the Third  World countries in Southeast Asia and Latin America, have been  mercilessly victimized by the United States' secret  organization, the CIA. The latter has carried out all manner of  the most poisonous activities against the sacred wish of diverse  countries desiring to live with unity and in peace within their  territorial integrity.    Our nation and people were victims of the 1970 coup d'etat  organized by the CIA, which has continued to destroy Cambodia's  independence, peace, and neutrality. Now there are reports that  the United States has decided to send a Peace Corps, which is a  division of the worldwide notorious CIA to Cambodia to continue  destructive activities against our nation and people.    Our nation, people, and the patriotic forces will in no way  remain idle and allow the CIA or its Peace Corps to do away with  Cambodia at will. We will certainly continue our struggle to  restore Cambodia's independence and peace within its territorial  integrity.</p>

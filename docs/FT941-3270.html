			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / IMF chief steps into Russia's gathering economic storm These are hard times in Russia, and fears are growing that the country is becoming ungovernable, or governable only with an iron hand. Mr Michel Camdessus, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, arrives in Moscow today for a five-day visit whose rarity testifies to the urgency of the times. It is a crisis compounded of political drift, a largely absent president and a swathe of problems untackled and festering: at root, however, it is economic. The credit squeeze of last year has worked. Inflation came down last month to 10 per cent, half of January's figure. But industrial production was also down, by 24 per cent against February 1993 as a result of the squeeze. This may continue. Russian officials say Mr Victor Gerashchenko, the central bank chairman, has massively undershot the credit targets recommended by the government's Credit Committee, advancing only 40 per cent of the total agreed. Though the motives of one who has always called for large credits in order to prevent industrial collapse are unclear, the result is that the squeeze is likely to continue. The budget agreed by the government  - but not yet passed by parliament  - is similarly tough. It proposes expenditure of around Rbs180,000bn, and an income of Rbs120,000bn  - the deficit is as much as 10 per cent of gross national product (on IMF calculations, more like 16-17 per cent). But on these figures, say the main powers in the land, there is no way of maintaining social order or production. General Pavel Grachev, the defence minister, yesterday publicly complained that the Rbs37,000bn put by for the military on the 1994 budget was less than half of what they needed. 'If the situation does not change, there can be no talk not only about reforming the army, but about providing for Russia's security as well.' He estimated that if the sum were not increased, the arms ordered would have to be cut back by one quarter  - decimating the already fragile military industrial plants. The energy, agricultural and regional leaders have not yet made their demands public in this way  - but they will be of the same order. The possibility of holding the line looks slim. Yet on the income side, the picture is worse. Budgeted revenues of Rbs120,000bn now look impossible to attain  - since government income is now running at Rbs70,000bn-Rbs80,000bn a year and, in the words of one western financial expert, 'there is no reason why it should get any better'. This is the potentially horrifying situation into which Mr Camdessus steps today. Russian officials say he is now under pressure from the Group of Seven industrial countries to deliver aid: senior G7 officials say this is not so, pointing to a discussion in Frankfurt last month at which it was agreed that the Fund should make up its own mind and insist on the observation of conventional criteria. Certain it is that the managing director brings no panacea: however, he does bring a slender lifeline of the second half  - Dollars 1.5bn  - of the Dollars 3bn systemic transformation facility set up after last year's Tokyo IMF summit to provide rapid loans to Russia, though he may not be able to throw it if the government cannot convince him and his officials that the budget is credible. Mr Camdessus is deeply concerned with Russia  - the largest and most intractable problem the Fund has to deal with. But while IMF officials have found their engagement with the Russian government earlier this year wearing, they and other western finance officials have been impressed by the seriousness of the Russian leadership's approach to reform. These people now acknowledge that the prime minister, Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, conventionally viewed as a conservative, energy-lobby man, has become a convert to tight budgets. This message was conveyed to Mr Camdessus, and to senior World Bank officials, earlier this year by the Swedish financier and investor, Mr Peter Castenfelt, whose company, Archipelago Enterprises,is actively involved in the Russian market. After their meeting in Washington, Mr Camdessus was invited to Moscow to see for himself. Mr Castenfelt, named in February as an unpaid adviser to the Russian prime minister on enterprise issues, said yesterday: 'I believe these people are very tough and want to continue enterprise reform. They are faced with huge problems, and this budget is murder for the companies - but I am sure they will go to great lengths to stick to it.' If they do so, they risk a great deal. The Russian power structure has at its apex  - President Boris Yeltsin  - off at the Black Sea resort of Socchi for a two-week recuperation from flu after two and a half months of exceptionally low profile. Many in the parliament, including relatively sympathetic figures such as Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, head of the Yabloko group, point to the dichotomy between a president with exceptional powers in the constitution and no apparent will to use them. Calls for a firm hand have reappeared. A Yeltsin ally, Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, chairman of parliament's upper house, has proposed a state of economic emergency. This is the deepest economic crisis Russia has yet faced: it will make the next few months dangerous indeed.</p>

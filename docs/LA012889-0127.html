			<p><P> January 28, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ELDER-CARE NEEDS OF ORANGE COUNTY WORKERS STUDIED  </P> <P> For nearly 2 years, Gayle Thompson spent part of her workday at National  Education Corp. in Irvine worrying not about business, but about a family  member who needed constant attention.  </P> <P> Thompson was trying to take care of her frail, elderly mother at home and hold  on to a full-time job at the same time.  </P> <P> Sometimes she called her house as many as five times a day. "And if my mother  didn't come to the phone, I panicked and would drive home to make sure she  hadn't fallen or become unconscious," said Thompson, 49, an NEC benefits  administrator. Several months ago, Thompson had to put her 79-year old mother  in a Lake Forest nursing home.  </P> <P> Thompson is one of the millions of working Americans searching for ways to  balance the demands of the workplace and the responsibilities of caring for the  elderly. On Friday she joined about 150 Orange County health-care  professionals, social workers and corporate representatives at a conference to  discuss potential solutions.  </P> <P> Participants agreed that care for the elderly is a growing problem that  employers eventually must address. But so far, few companies in Orange County  have been willing to even consider the issue.  </P> <P> Recent studies indicate that employee concerns about elderly relatives have  increased absenteeism and turnover and lowered productivity at big and small  businesses alike.  </P> <P> "The cost to companies is astronomical," said Roy Azarnoff, director of  Eldercare Management Group, a Dana Point consulting firm. "Only recently have  some of them begun to realize it."  </P> <P> The Travelers Insurance Cos. has found through surveys that one of every five  employees older than 30 are trying to care for an elderly relative.  </P> <P> The surveys show that those workers on average spend 10.2 hours a week to care  for those relatives, with 8% spending 35 hours or more. Often, this goes on for  years.  </P> <P> "This is an issue that must be addressed," state Sen. Marian Bergeson told  participants at Friday's conference. "It's not just going to go away."  </P> <P> The most common types of assistance being provided by younger family members  include transportation, shopping and companionship. Sometimes those needs must  be addressed during working hours.  </P> <P> "Obviously, employees can't fully concentrate on their work under those  conditions," said Mike Shore, an IBM spokesman in Armonk Village, N.Y.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, IBM will celebrate the 1-year anniversary of its elder-care  program, the first of its kind in the country.  </P> <P> The computer giant put together a national network of 175 community-based  organizations to assist IBM's 223,000 employees in finding care for their  elderly relatives.  </P> <P> For instance, IBM could put an Orange County employee in touch with the  appropriate agency to help him find a home nurse for his mother in Chicago. The  referral service is free.  </P> <P> IBM won't say what the program has cost, but it claims productivity is up among  the 8,000 employees who have used it. "There is a bottom-line benefit for us in  doing this," Shore said.  </P> <P> So far, however, none of Orange County's larger corporations has adopted a  similar program. And at least one survey says they probably won't anytime soon.  </P> <P> Personnel Journal, a Costa Mesa publication, reported in June that nine out of  10 personnel directors in a national survey said their companies had no plans  to develop an elder-care program, even though seven out of 10 said it affected  worker output and morale.  </P> <P> About 8% of those surveyed said care for the elderly as a potential corporate  benefit should be "ignored because it's not a real issue."  </P> <P> Those who believe that corporations should adopt elder-care programs say the  situation is only going to worsen as the number of senior citizens increases  and as more women enter the work force.  </P> <P> Conference participants are calling for companies to survey their work forces  and set up focus groups to work on the problems they find. Some say businesses  should set up adult day-care centers or offer employees flexible working hours.  </P> <P> "Some people prefer to work 10 hours a day, 4 days a week so they have an extra  day to take care of mom," Azarnoff said.  </P> <P> Several organizations provide counseling to people with elderly relatives. They  include the Orange Regional Resource Center in Fullerton, which sponsored  Friday's conference, and the Senior Citizens Information and Referral in Santa  Ana.  </P></p>

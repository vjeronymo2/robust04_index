			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME IMPROVEMENT;  </P> <P> NOTHING BORING ABOUT VERSATILE ELECTRIC DRILL;  </P> <P> POWER TOOLS: ATTACHMENTS ENABLE DRILL TO BE USED TO SAND, SHARPEN, MIX PAINT,  CUT METAL AND TURN SCREWS.  </P> <P> Every homeowner and apartment dweller should have an electric drill in his  toolbox.  </P> <P> Whether you opt for the extra power and range of uses of a corded electric  drill or the convenience of a rechargeable battery-powered cordless model, you  will find that the electric drill is dozens of tools in one because attachments  make it so versatile.  </P> <P> Power drills come in a variety of chuck sizes (the chuck holds drill bits and  other attachments) and turning speed ranges (revolutions per minute or rpm). In  general, the smaller the chuck the higher the rpm and the lower the turning  power, and vice versa.  </P> <P> The most practical electric drill for basic home improvements is one that has a  three-eighth-inch chuck with a variable and reversing speed range. This means  that the rpm increases as the trigger is pulled harder, and that there is a  switch that allows the drill to turn in the opposite direction. Corded drills  have an "on" lock feature on the switch.  </P> <P> Prices start at about $40 for a good-quality corded drill and about $70 for a  rechargeable battery-powered cordless model. When instructions are followed  carefully and goggles are worn, either type of drill is safe to use, even by  the novice.  </P> <P> Look for electric drills at most large hardware stores, home centers or tool  supply stores. Either domestically made or imported models are acceptable, but  avoid any brand that is noticeably less expensive than average.  </P> <P> What can an electric drill do?  </P> <P> Aside from drilling holes in about any material one finds around the house,  including wood, metal, glass, plastic, concrete, brick and ceramic tile, the  electric drill performs lots of other jobs. Here are some of the more common  examples:  </P> <P> Screwdriver. Once you have experienced the ease and speed of driving screws  with an electric drill, and especially a cordless model, it is hard to go back  to turning them with an ordinary screwdriver.  </P> <P> Most hardware stores sell an attachment called a "magnetic bit holder" which,  when used with a variable-speed and reversing drill, allows you to turn most  any type and size of screw you will find.  </P> <P> The built-in magnet holds the screws at any angle until they are driven into  the work. Phillips-type screws work exceptionally well with this drill  attachment.  </P> <P> Sander. With the use of an attachment called a "sandpaper disk holder," or an  attachment called a "drum sander," your electric drill becomes a very good  electric sander. Large sanding jobs are better suited to a corded drill. Use  the "on" lock.  </P> <P> The sandpaper disc holder can be used for rough sanding or paint removal, while  the drum sander is ideally suited for smoothing edges and for curved surfaces.  </P> <P> Polisher. Most sandpaper disk holders can be fitted with a bonnet for waxing  and polishing. Excellent with car wax.  </P> <P> Wire brush. For removal of rust and paint from metal, wood and concrete  surfaces, there is a wire brush drill attachment that does the job quick and  easy.  </P> <P> Grinder. When goggles are worn, any electric drill can become a reasonable  grinder with the proper attachment. Use a grinding wheel to sharpen drill bits,  chisels knives and other tools. Hold the drill to your workbench with a special  clamp called a "drill stand" (available at most tool or hardware stores). Use  the "on" lock feature of a corded drill.  </P> <P> A grinding disk attachment can be used to quickly remove paint from wood and  metal surfaces. This attachment looks like the sandpaper disk holder but is  metal and has sharp perforations.  </P> <P> For smoothing "tight" spots on irregularly shaped objects or for removing sharp  edges on most metals, use a "grinding stone." Grinding stones come in a variety  of shapes and sizes and are mounted on a shank to fit any drill.  </P> <P> Paint mixer. This attachment allows easy thinning and mixing of any type of  paint without removing it from the can. It is a long rod with one or two  four-point blades on the end. The drill turns the rod and the blades mix the  paint just as a blender mixes food.  </P> <P> Be sure to put the blades into the paint before turning on the drill, and turn  the drill off before removing. Either a corded or cordless drill is fine for  paint mixing.  </P> <P> Hole saw. An attachment called a "hole saw" allows you to make holes in wood  larger than is normal with standard drill bits. Hole saws are generally sold in  sizes from three-quarter-inch to 4 1/2 inches and can bore through wood up to  about 2 inches thick. Adjustable "hole cutters" are a single unit that adjusts  to cut holes from about 1 inch to 2 1/2 inches in diameter in wood up to about  three-quarter-inch thick.  </P> <P> Circle cutter. Circle cutters are also adjustable and allow holes to be cut up  to 12 inches in diameter. Both hole saws and circle cutters work better with  corded electric drills.  </P> <P> Metal cutter. With yet another attachment called a "carbide impregnated metal  cutoff disk" a corded electric drill can be used to cut steel, aluminum or  copper. Use a drill stand to anchor the drill to a work bench. Wear goggles and  stand to one side.  </P> <P> Auger. An excellent way to drill holes in the earth for bulb planting or  fertilizing shade trees and shrubs is with a large drill bit called an "auger."  This device allows you to easily drill down 12-18 inches.  </P> <P> Kite string winder. My personal favorite drill attachment is a make-it-yourself  kite string winder for a cordless drill. Take a piece of 2-x-2-inch, 1-x-2-inch  lumber or round dowel 1 inch or 2 inches in diameter and cut an 8-inch section.  </P> <P> At either end of the 8-inch piece, drive in a 2-inch nail so that three-quarter  inch of the nail sticks out. Cut off the head of the nail with a wire cutter or  hack saw. Now insert the three-quarter-inch "stem" into the drill chuck and  tighten.  </P> <P> Presto! An instant kite string winder that beats anything you can buy.  </P> <P> Even if you rarely work around the house, an electric drill is a must-have  tool. It is the type of possession that, once owned, you wonder how you got  along without.  </P> <P> VERSATILE ELECTRIC DRILL  </P> <P> Geared chuck: Holds drills and other attachments to be turned by the drill.  </P> <P> Nameplate: Lists amperage and voltage, often rpm, but rarely horsepower.  </P> <P> Housing: Should be of insulating material if drill is not the grounding type.  </P> <P> Switch: Should have smooth action, some means of locking in the "on" position.  Should also be variable speed and reversible.  </P> <P> Cord: Check on length. Better drills have longer cords. Chuck key holder should  be attached to the cord. Cordless models have battery pack in the handle.  </P> <P> Paint mixing attachment mixes paint in the can.  </P> <P> Hole saws cut holes 3/4 of an inch to 4 1/2 inch to about 2 inches thick.  </P> <P> Mount drill in "drill stand" for sanding small object.  </P> <P> Grinding wheel attachment is used with drill stand. For sharpening drill bits  and tools. Wear goggles.  </P> <P> Drill attachments: grinding stones, hole saw, adjustable hole saw, for Phillips  screws, for slotted screws.  </P></p>

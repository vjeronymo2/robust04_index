			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / The Cadbury Report: Proposals receive boardroom backing MANY boardrooms welcomed the Cadbury committee's proposals and said they were already far advanced in carrying out its main recommendations. There was general recognition of the need for a greater role for non-executive directors, and backing for a code of practice widely seen as having struck the right balance between prescription and the flexibility required within individual companies. Most companies believed the code would prove acceptable and had sufficient teeth to ensure that it was widely implemented. It was hoped that it would help minimise the prospect of legislation in areas covered by the code. Mr Graham Mason, director of company affairs at the Confederation of British Industry, said the committee had put forward practical answers to some of the key issues of corporate governance. It built on the concept of the unitary board and the existing means of promoting the accountability of directors. Mr Blenyth Jenkins, director of corporate affairs at the Institute of Directors, said the majority of companies already practised many of the recommendations but there remained 'a tiny minority which cocks a snook at good corporate principles and which need to be brought into line'. He said some companies were finding it increasingly hard to raise capital because of shareholder concerns about elements of their management policy. The document provided a clear framework against which they could be judged. Imperial Chemical Industries was confident that it operated according to most of the recommendations. Sir Denys Henderson is both chairman and chief executive but the company has appointed Mr Ronnie Hampel as chief operating officer. ICI already provides a breakdown between executive pay and bonuses, and all members of its audit and remuneration committees are non-executive directors. Sir Christopher Hogg, the chairman of two Courtaulds companies and of Reuters, said the findings would not present difficulties of compliance within his companies. He was relieved that it was not a revolutionary document and added: 'There was a danger it could have gone overboard in proposing new rules and regulations, making it hard for companies to work in a flexible way. I am mightily relieved it has not.' Mr David Prosser, chief executive of Legal and General, said his company, as an investor, believed in good corporate governance and 'ought to achieve it in our own house'. Legal and General complies with most of the proposals on non-executive directors. Mr Prosser added: 'Our interim report is discussed and reviewed by the auditors, although it is not fully audited. We do not publish a half-year balance sheet and do not really think it is necessary for most companies, but it would not be a problem for us.' Sir Nicholas Goodison, former Stock Exchange chairman and now chairman of TSB Group, said: 'I broadly welcome it. I think it is positive and I think it improves the level of corporate practice.' He said that since joining TSB he had introduced most of the practices recommended by Cadbury, particularly relating to non-executive directors. TSB audit and remuneration committees were entirely composed of non-executive directors, full details of all directors' salaries were published, with names, and divisions of responsibility between directors were made clear. Sir Patrick Meaney, who holds six non-executive directorships, including the chairmanship of Rank Organisation, said: 'There is nothing in it so outrageous or costly to provide sound reasons for rejection. They are par for the course for any self-respecting company.' Mr Tony Mitchard, chief executive of Avon Rubber, said the proposals 'made good sense' and his company, which already complies with some of the recommendations, would be happy to comply with its findings. Mr Mitchard said that audited interim statements 'would obviously cost rather more money by way of audit fees, and it would take a bit more time, but I do not think it would be too burdensome'.</p>

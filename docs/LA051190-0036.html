			<p><P> May 11, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 'ENDANGERED' PESTS  </P> <P> As a child born and raised in Hollywood, one of the rites of fall, along with  getting new shoes for school, was to call the "Rat Man," which is what he  called himself.  </P> <P> Our street was lined with large palm trees, and colonies of kangaroo rats lived  in them.  </P> <P> When fall came and the weather cooled, they all came into our house and those  of our neighbors. Hence, the necessity for a visit from the cheerful "Rat Man"  to rid the neighborhood of these filthy, disease-carrying pests. We all got to  know him well.  </P> <P> So you can understand my disbelief -- my disgust -- at seeing in the paper that  these pests had become an "endangered species" and so had to be protected and  preserved. Can fleas, cockroaches or termites be far behind?  </P> <P> It is such idiocy that will make the whole environmental movement look foolish  and thwart perfectly logical and necessary actions with which no right-thinking  person can disagree.  </P> <P> BARBARA MCCARTHY  </P> <P> Capistrano Beach  </P></p>

			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Nippon Shinpan to securitise car loans NIPPON Shinpan, Japan's largest consumer card services company, will securitise part of its car loans to diversify ways of acquiring cash, Reuter reports. This will be the first time a Japanese company has securitised car loans. The first lot of securities, totalling Y3bn, will be sold in a few months. Each one-year note is worth Y10m and the minimum investment size will be Y50m, yielding around 6 per cent interest. Nippon Shinpan plans to acquire ratings on these notes from foreign firms such as Moody's Investors Service, in order to protect investors, he said. Orix, Japan's largest leasing company, recently securitised part of its leasing business and finished selling the securities last week.</p>

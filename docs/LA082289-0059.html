			<p><P> August 22, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VALLEY ROUNDUP: HOH WATER TECHNOLOGY'S TRADING SYMBOLS CHANGE  </P> <P> HOH Water Technology in Newbury Park said its stock trading symbols were  changed by the National Assn. of Securities Dealers to indicate that HOH is  again in compliance with the NASD's minimum capital requirements.  </P> <P> HOH's securities trade on the over-the-counter market, which is governed by the  NASD. HOH is developing a water-filtration system for the housing and  industrial markets.  </P> <P> In April, the NASD had added a "C" to the trading symbols of HOH's three  securities, which are its common stock, units that consist of common shares and  warrants, and the warrants alone. The "C" indicated that the NASD, although  finding HOH's capital to be too low, believed that HOH would soon bolster its  capital to meet minimum levels.  </P> <P> Now HOH is again in compliance and the NASD dropped the "C" from HOH's  securities. The common stock symbol is now HOHI, the unit is HOHIU and the  warrant is HOHIW.  </P></p>

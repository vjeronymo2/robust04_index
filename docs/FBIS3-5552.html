			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] After the North-South working-level contact ended,  Vice Unification Minister Song Yong-tae, our side's senior  delegate to the contact, said that the North side had shown a  positive sign by proposing an amendment to the agreement  regarding the procedures for the exchange of special envoys, but  the North and South failed to make any practical progress in the  discussions because the North side has continued to insist on  resolving four issues in advance.    Delegate Song Yong-tae said that senior delegates from the  two sides met separately and frankly exchanged their views for  approximately 20 minutes after the working-level contact ended.  He did not comment in detail on the contents of the meeting,  but said that the sixth North-South contact, which will be held  on 12 March, would likely be a turning point in determining the  success or failure of the exchange of special envoys.    Delegate Song Yong-tae said that at present, he cannot be  pessimistic nor optimistic on whether the exchange of special  envoys is held before 21 March, the day the third round of  U.S.-North Korean high-level talks is scheduled. He stressed  that our government's position remains unchanged, and added that  the North side is likely to be aware of the fact that the third  round of U.S.-North Korean talks cannot be held without the  exchange of special envoys between the North and South.</p>

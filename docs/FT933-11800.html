			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Chipmaker files patent complaint NATIONAL Semiconductor, the US chipmaker, has filed a complaint with the US International Trade Commission against Mitsubishi Electric of Japan. The complaint relates to a patent infringement suit also filed by the US company, Louise Kehoe reports from San Francisco. National charges that Mitsubishi's semiconductor products infringe several broad patents covering basic semiconductor technology. The complaints were filed against Mitsubishi after 'exhausting all possible negotiations for a cross-licensing agreement,' National said. National is asking the ITC to halt imports of semiconductor products that allegedly infringe its patents.</p>

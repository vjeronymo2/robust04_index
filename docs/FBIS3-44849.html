During the two-day meeting, members discussed the  termination  of the Hong Kong British authorities' last Legislative Council,  two municipal councils, and district board. Members unanimously  believed that the Hong Kong British authorities' administration  over Hong Kong will end on 30 June 1997, that the legal basis  enabling them to maintain their power will also disappear, that  the original political structures embodying their administration  will as a matter of course terminate at the same time, and that  neither can the Hong Kong British authorities' administration  continue to exist after 30 June 1997 nor do the Hong Kong  British authorities have the right to make any decision on the  continued existence of these structures after 30 June 1997. In  addition, the subcommittee meeting studied and discussed the  election system for the first Legislative Council and district  organizations of the Hong Kong SAR.    It has been learned that the fourth and fifth meetings of  the  PWC's GAS will be held in Beijing from 28 to 29 January and from  24 to 26 February, respectively.</p>

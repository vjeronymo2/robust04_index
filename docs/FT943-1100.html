			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Company News (This Week): Hammerson - Other Companies The stock market will be waiting to see if Hammerson provides details of the planned sale of its Pounds 175m Australian property portfolio along with its interim results today. With around 50 per cent of its assets overseas, Hammerson is among the most international of UK property companies, so its comments on market conditions in Australia and Canada - where it acquired three shopping malls in July - will be watched closely. Analysts are expecting pre-tax profits of around Pounds 22m, against Pounds 15.2m last time, and a dividend unchanged at 3.5p.</p>

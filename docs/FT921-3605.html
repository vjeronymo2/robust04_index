			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brazilian orange growers faced with harvest delay THE HARVESTING of Brazil's 1992-93 orange crop will be delayed until July or August, instead of the usual late May or June, because of lack of rain in the flowering period, industry officials said, reports Reuter from Rio de Janeiro. Mr Roberto D'Andrea, director of external relations at Citrosuco Paulista, one of Brazil's biggest producers of frozen concentrated orange juice, said the delay would cause the industry's carryover to fall substantially. By the end of March the industry should have a better idea of the length of the delay in the harvest, one trader said. 'A two- to six-week delay is possible,' he added. 'If the harvest is delayed it could cause stocks to be drawn down.' Last month the AB Citrus industry association said that the Brazilian FCOJ industry's carryover world-wide would fall to 157,000 tonnes by June 30, 1992, from 331,000 tonnes a year earlier. Mr D'Andrea, who is also head of the National Association of Citrus Industries, called those figures 'reliable'. In recent weeks weather in the citrus region has been favourable to the crop and rainfall has been sufficient, industry officials said. Brazil's biggest producers of FCOJ made a preliminary estimate for the 1992-93 crop of 262m boxes (40.8 kg each), up from 240m boxes in 1991-92. The Brazilian Association of Citrus Juice Industries (Abrassucos), which represents small and medium size processors, made a preliminary estimate of 225m boxes.</p>

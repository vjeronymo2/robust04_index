Speaking at the day of Orthodox and Slav unity event  organised in central Belgrade by the international Serbian  community and the Belgrade-based non-governmental White Rose  anti-racist organization, Buha said that the international  community was advocating "a dual plan of a federation and  confederation," instead of trying to separate Bosnia's three  warring nations which can no longer live together.    Under strong U.S. pressure, Bosnian Croats and Moslems  signed  an agreement last Tuesday undertaking to form a Moslem-Croat  federation in the former Yugoslav Republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, and subsequently enter into a loose  confederation with neighbouring Croatia.    "The Croats and Moslems cam unite without us, if they want  to, but they cannot unite against us," said Buha and added there  could certainly be "no return to any sovereign and integral  Bosnia-Herzegovina."    The concept of Moslem-Croat federation is intended by  Washington to make it possible for the Moslems to preserve an  integral Bosnia-Herzegovina, enlarge the territory under their  control and gain access to the sea. Last, but not least, it  should create a firm negotiating and, possibly military, bloc  against the Bosnian Serbs.    President of the White Rose organization Radomir Smiljanic  said that the "Serbs are demonstrating their desire for a speedy  signing of just peace for Bosnia-Herzegovina" and added that the  day of Orthodox and Slav unity was being held simultaneously in  all world capitals which have Serb communities.    "The world has met with Islamization, Germanization,  conversion to Roman Catholicism, but it has never heard of  conversion to Orthodox Christianity, because nothing like that  has even been practiced," Smiljanic said. He added that "Serbs  have never in their history waged crusades, they have only  defended their peace and freedom."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statements by Supreme Council Chairman Ivan Plyushch and </F> New Ukraine leader Volodymyr Hrynyov; place and date not given:  "Let Us Light New Year Candles for Fulfilling Our Wishes"]    [Text] [Plyushch] This past year has not been easy for our  country and people. However, those who believe that the current  hardships and economic crisis have been originated exclusively  during the years of Ukraine's independence are wrong. I would  like to recall that from 1985 [to 1990] the USSR foreign debt  increased from $28 billion to $55 billion, and hard currency  reserves decreased two-fold. This "spending" took place over  some five years. In other words, we have come to the crisis not  alone, but along with our brothers and sisters from the Union,  during several years. By the way, they also, as well as an  array of countries from the former socialist camp, are  experiencing difficulties caused by the processes connected with  economic reform.    However, we are not without sin. One could provide many  examples of our own mistakes caused by the extreme complexity of  the state-building process, our lack of experience, and our  evident shortsightedness.    Nevertheless, we should not seek the guilty today, as we  used  to do, but we should jointly find a solution. One such  solution, in my opinion, is to liberate producers of industrial  and agricultural goods. In place of the Moscow government,  today we have the one in Kiev. Certain voices can being heard  saying that it is necessary to establish tough administrative  structures in the oblasts, and that they should take everything  in their hands and restore order. But a producer should only  obey the law and by the law be connected with the state.    In politics, there is a priority task for us today --  elections for the new legislature formed along professional  lines.    Certain people predict that the people will not participate  in the elections, because they do not trust anybody. But, this  is an incorrect opinion. They want to trust somebody, but they  do not know whom.    I believe that it is impossible -- and sociological surveys  confirm this -- for our people to elect a dictatorship, and this  will lead the country away from the edge of the precipice. The  people must elect legislators who will endorse centrist  approaches to the most acute problems. Only such legislators  will be able to form an efficient government.    I believe that not a single man, for sure not a dictator or  yet another secretary general, but a centrist bloc that will  develop a national platform, not a narrow party one, will become  Ukraine's leader in 1994.    [Hrynyov] I believe that 1994 will see the introduction of  intensive reforms in Ukraine. I do not expect any new political  forces to appear and assume responsibility for carrying out such  reforms. I think that the harsh reality will force Ukraine to  reform its economy.    We have wasted the opportunity to do so over the last two  years. We have not even tried to actually introduce reforms, but  spent our time on uncomprehensible policy which follows the  principle of "neither a plan nor a market." This has led to the  sharp deterioration of basic preconditions that are necessary  for the introduction of market reforms.    Two years ago, one could assess our situation as dramatic,  today -- as tragic: We are beginning reform while in a state of  complete economic destruction, a lack of control over economic  processes, and the collapse of the financial system. Despite  these facts, I repeat that 1994 will be the year of beginning  economic reforms.    Guarantees for success do not exist. Failure to proceed on  the path of transformations means losing Ukraine.    I am very aware of public opinion polls, and they indicate  that the psychological atmosphere in Ukraine is that reforms are  considered as not one of the variants, but as the only one  possibility, and that there is no other path but the path of  market reforms.</p>

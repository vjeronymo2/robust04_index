			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by station commentator Yun Pyong-son: "Why Do </F> They Keep Silent?"]    [Text] Members of Greenpeace, an international civilian  environmental organization, arrived in Samchok port, South  Korea, on 12 April, at the invitation of the Environment  Movement Alliance, an antinuclear movement organization in South  Korea. They waged various forms of antinuclear movements,  including exposure of the criminal nuclear weapons development  maneuvers by the puppet clique.    On 14 April, about 20 members of this organization held an  antinuclear rally in Samchok together with 1,000-odd members of  environment protection and antinuclear movement organizations in  South Korea. They warned of the danger of leakage of  radioactivity from South Korean atomic power stations, and  strongly demanded suspension of construction of atomic power  stations to the puppet authorities.    Nevertheless, the South Korean puppets have yet to reply and  are keeping silent. This is nothing but a foolish trick to  conceal their criminal act of dumping nuclear wastes, conceal  the truth about nuclear weapons development maneuvers, and evade  international denunciation.    It is a universal desire of mankind to live in a world free  from nuclear radioactivity. This is why the Greenpeace members  carried out an anti-nuclear movement by visiting South Korea,  and why the South Korean environmental movement organizations  waged the struggle with them. However, the South Korean ruling  bunch, going counter to the people's desire, developed nuclear  weapons and indiscriminately dumped nuclear wastes into the sea,  thus shocking the people. According to the material, the nuclear  wastes that the South Korean puppets dumped into seas for the  past seven years from 1986 to 1992 reach as much as 10 million  billion and 1,000 trillion becquerels.    Such an act of dumping nuclear wastes is still continuing  under the rule of the Kim Yong-sam traitorous regime. The  puppets' act of dumping nuclear wastes is not only an  antinational act of reducing the Korean peninsula and its  surrounding seas into a wasteland by contaminating them with  nuclear material but also an intolerable criminal act of  severing the nation's lifeline and destroying nature's  ecological environment. This act is also a flagrant  infringement of international laws and treaties that totally ban  the dumping of nuclear wastes into oceans. Moreover, one cannot  think of the act of dumping nuclear wastes without having the  puppet clique's nuclear weapons development maneuvers come to  mind.    As is known to all, nuclear weapons development maneuvers  that began in the early seventies are being accelerated in a  very grave stage. It is an already-exposed secret that the  puppet clique brought in a large quantity of plutonium from  overseas for production and stockpiling, and that the  heavy-water reactor now in operation in Wolsong, and the  multipurpose research reactor in Taedok, are reactors for  nuclear weapons development.    Today in South Korea, the disastrous situation in which  people are suffering various types of cancerous diseases and  losing lives, continuously takes place, and the number of cases  of pregnant women giving birth prematurely after eating fish  caught from the sea, and giving birth to deformed children or  miscarrying, is drastically increasing. All this is not  accidental.    Thus, while damages from nuclear radioactivity have reached  a  grave stage in South Korea, the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique has  not taken any step nor shown any response to the just demand by  Greenpeace. This is because the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique is  fearing that its criminal act would be exposed to the world,  like a thief fearing discovery of his theft. This also shows  that the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique will continue accelerating  the development of nuclear weapons to ruin fellow countrymen and  that it will destroy the natural environment by continually  dumping nuclear wastes into seas to threaten the life of fellow  countrymen.    As long as the Kim Yong-sam traitorous clique remains  intact,  the lands will be reduced into a wasteland and the people cannot  evade nuclear calamities. The Kim Yong-sam traitorous clique  which inflicts disaster on the people by indiscriminately  dumping nuclear wastes while accelerating nuclear weapons  development and contaminated environment, must be made stand  before court and must be sternly judged by the nation.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial report: "Petition of Legion's `Agitators' Stirs </F> Defense Ministry"]    [Text] The petition of the Rakovski Bulgarian Officer  Legion, regarding the inadequacy of the military budget adopted  by the National Assembly one week ago, prompted meetings and  discussions at the Ministry of Defense.    Minister Valentin Mikhaylov sharply reacted to the petition  and in a 28 February letter to the initiators he stressed that  the legion's activists have crossed the limits of democracy, and  that agitators will not be tolerated in the Army. On the same  day the president discussed the situation in the Army with his  military advisers.    On 1 and 2 March the leadership of the Ministry of Defense  had a working meeting with commanders and officers from the 1st,  2d, and 3d Armies, the Press Center of the Ministry of Defense  announced on 2 March. Later, at a "special meeting," the  ministry's leadership and the General Staff discussed the issues  posed at the meeting related to the structural reform in the  Army, the officers' wages and housing conditions, and the  everyday life of the soldiers.    The same issues have been repeatedly posed in the past by  the  Rakovski Legion which, in recent weeks, energetically insisted  on adopting the 37-billion-leva military budget requested by the  General Staff. The parliament voted only 12 billion leva for  defense needs.    Despite the limited budget possibilities, the defense  minister ordered that proposals be prepared on resolving the  most acute problems.    The Press Center of the Ministry of Defense noted that  "violations of the military regulations and discipline on the  part of certain officers," were discussed at the meeting.  However, the written announcement does not indicate whether the  petition's initiators will be punished.</p>

			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / World Trade News: EC and US go for broke on cutting tariffs  -Negotiators zero in on stumbling block to Uruguay Round a traditional focus of international trade talks - has now become the key to success or failure of the six-year-old Uruguay Round. Agreement between the US and the European Community on a tariff-cutting package is needed to provide the framework for duty reductions by other participants in the 108-nation Round. But negotiators believe progress in this area could also induce Washington to soften its demands elsewhere in the negotiations, especially regarding anti-dumping and anti-subsidy actions, in the interests of a speedy settlement. The race is on for at least the broad outlines of a Uruguay Round accord before US President-elect Bill Clinton takes office on January 20. His untried and inexperienced trade policy team will not be in a position to conclude the necessary agreements before the US administration's negotiating authority expires on March 2, thereby setting back the timetable for the talks yet again. However, trade officials in Geneva admit they face an uphill struggle in their attempt to secure a framework tariff deal by Friday, when senior trade negotiators meet to review progress in the Round. This is partly because the tariff negotiations are enormously complex as they involve changes in tariffs on thousands of individual items. The main reason that the US-EC discussions on industrial tariffs have made such little progress over the past two years is because the two sides differ fundamentally in their approach to and implementation of tariff-cutting. Washington wants to achieve the Uruguay Round target of a one-third cut in tariffs mainly by a selective lowering of duties, including a number of sectors in which the major traders would agree to reciprocal duty-free access. The US zero-for-zero list covers pharmaceuticals, construction machinery and medical equipment, to which the EC has agreed, along with harmonisation at low levels of duties on chemicals. There is also agreement in principle to phase out tariffs on steel, though the US is making this conditional on reaching a still-contentious multilateral steel agreement that would also eliminate most state subsidies for steel producers. However, Washington is having little success in persuading the Community to go along with zero-for-zero agreements for paper and wood products, non-ferrous metals, electronics, fish and alcoholic drinks. The revised US tariff offer presented to trading partners last Friday amounts to cuts averaging just over one third - but this includes zero-for-zero deals the EC and others have not agreed. The EC dislikes this sectoral approach to tariff cutting, stating that it contradicts the essence of trade bargaining - the trade-off between concessions in one area against gains in another. 'Zero-for-zero deals are unbalanced by definition,' says one senior EC negotiator, because the sectors put forward are always the ones which most benefit the demander. The EC wanted the negotiations to adopt a formula approach, in which all tariffs would be reduced but high ones would come down more steeply than low ones. This would have simplified the talks greatly , but the US refused to accept a formula, largely because it does not want programmed cuts in very high tariffs on textiles and other sensitive goods. These 'tariff peaks', which for textiles range up to 36 per cent, have been a principal target of EC negotiators, who have offered harmonised tariffs on textiles with a maximum duty of 12 per cent. Officials from the US argue that they are prepared to cut high tariffs on textiles, ceramics, footwear, glass and dyestuffs, provided they have a satisfactory zero-for-zero package. However, the EC says it is not prepared to concede more zero-for-zero deals unless Washington puts its 'tariff peak' cards on the table. Even then, Brussels could face problems in agreeing, say, duty-free entry for electronics goods, where the EC's 14 per cent tariff on semiconductors helps protect what remains of a European chip manufacturing presence from American and Asian competition. When the US and EC settled their farm trade spat at the end of November, they also agreed to aim for a 'maximum package' of tariff cuts going well beyond the one-third Uruguay Round target. Now that target, while achievable, is probably the maximum on offer. And even if Washington and Brussels reach a market access agreement between themselves, the Uruguay Round cannot end until all participants have drawn up tariff schedules. Though concessions swapped between the two biggest traders are automatically generalised through the operation of the Most-Favoured-Nation clause of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (requiring Gatt members to offer all countries the most favourable trade terms available), there are many goods they do not trade between themselves. Thus, if the US cuts tariff peaks on textile products of interest to the EC, it need not offer similar cuts on textile products which matter to third world exporters. Developing countries, which are themselves under pressure to cut their generally higher tariffs, say the results of the market access negotiations will be decisive in determining whether the overall Uruguay Round accord is acceptable.

			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Nigerian rivals in meeting over poll NIGERIA'S Social Democratic Party (SDP) is considering further talks in Abuja today with its rival, the National Republican Convention (NRC), and the National Electoral Commission (NEC) as civilian politicians search for a peaceful end to the eight-year military rule of President Ibrahim Babangida. The presence of both parties at the meeting could revive plans for an interim civilian government, which Gen Babangida proposed early this month, then rejected after both parties had agreed to take part. The SDP stands by the claim to victory by its candidate, Mr Moshood Abiola, in the June presidential elections, which the government annulled, and rejects Gen Babangida's proposal for new polls before the scheduled handover of power on August 27. Although the party's national executive plans to attend the tripartite meeting merely to state its opposition to fresh polls, it has a powerful fringe group, many of them former governors and presidential candidates, who are sceptical about the validity of direct talks. The positions of all the factions in Nigeria's political deadlock have appeared so intractable in the past week, that the government has prevailed on groups of traditional chiefs to counsel moderation.</p>

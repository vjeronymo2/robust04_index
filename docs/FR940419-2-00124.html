Discussion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange and with the requirements of Section 6(b) of the Act. <FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>  In particular, the Commission believes that the proposal is consistent with sections 6(b)(1), (3), and (5) of the Act. <FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>  Section 6(b)(1) requires that an exchange be organized and have the capacity to carry out the purposes of the Act and to comply, and to enforce compliance by its members and persons associated with its members with the Act, the rules and regulations thereunder, and the rules of the exchange. Section 6(b)(3) of the Act requires, among other things, that the rule of an exchange assures a fair representation of its members in the selection of its directors and administration of its affairs. Section 6(b)(5) requires, among other things, that the rules of an exchange be designed, in general, to protect investors and the public interest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 15 U.S.C. 78f(b) (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 15 U.S.C. 78f(1), (3), and (5) (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The Commission believes that the proposed rule change to limit Governor monetary liability to the Exchange and its members is consistent with the requirements of the Act. <FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>  In reaching its determination to approve this rule change, the Commission has considered the potential impact that the proposal will have on the special role and responsibilities of the Board of Governors of a registered national securities exchange under the Act. <FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> The Commission approved the same rule change for the CHX in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 27625 (January 16, 1989), 55 FR 2470 (January 24, 1990); the Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc. in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 27466 (November 22, 1989), 54 FR 49380 (November 30, 1989); and the Midwest Clearing Corp. in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 27446 (November 16, 1989), 54 FR 48707 (November 24, 1989). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 12 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> The Powers and responsibilities of the CHX's Board of Governors are set out in the Exchange's Constitution. Under Article III, Section 1, the Board of Governors is authorized to manage the business of the Exchange and is vested with all powers necessary for the government of the Exchange, including the regulation of the business conduct of members and member organizations and the promotion of the welfare, objects and purposes of the Exchange. Furthermore, Section 1 provides that the Board may establish Rules governing the qualifications for membership and the requirements for remaining a member in good standing. The Board is also given the power to fill vacancies in any office, including the Board of Governors, but excluding the Nominating Committee, until the next annual meeting. The Board also has the power to interpret the Constitution and Rules of the Exchange, and any interpretation made by it remains final and conclusive. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The Board of Governors of a national securities exchange has a crucial role in ensuring that the exchange meets its responsibilities as a self-regulatory organization under the Act. In view of this, the CHX proposal is limited so that the exemption from monetary damages is not available where liability is based, directly or indirectly, on a violation of the federal securities laws. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the same time, the Commission recognizes that national securities exchanges, such as the CHX, are incorporated under state law and, as such, are generally entitled to take advantage of provisions under state corporation codes to the extent they are consistent with the federal securities laws. The proposed rule change adequately balances the need to retain the special responsibilities of directors of national securities exchanges with the desire of the Exchange to adopt state law provisions pertaining to its corporate structure. The rule change allows the Exchange to take advantage of section 102(b)(7) of the Delaware Corporations Code as would any other organization incorporated in Delaware, except where the imposition of monetary actions involves a violation of the federal securities laws. Accordingly, Governors of the CHX will still be subject to the full panoply of damages in actions involving violations of the federal securities laws. <FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 13 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> To the extent there is any concern that the imposition of monetary damages against Board members for violations of federal securities laws would deter persons from acting on CHX's Board of Governors, the Commission notes that Article X of the CHX's Constitution and Article Eleventh of the CHX's Certificate of Incorporation allows the Exchange to provide indemnification to members of its Board of Governors, within the limits permitted by Delaware law, to safeguard them from expense and liability for actions that they take in such capacity in good faith in furtherance of, or without belief that such actions are opposed to, the best interests of the CHX and is members. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The Commission believes that the CHX's proposal to split its annual meeting and provide for an annual election meeting and an annual report meeting will allow Exchange members to better concentrate on the respective issues. The annual election meeting will be held to vote for Governors and the Nomination Committee. The annual report meeting will be held to provide management, the Board, and members an opportunity to discuss the previous year's results and current issues facing the Exchange. Because each of these meetings is of extreme importance and may involve lengthy discussions, the Commission believes holding two separate meetings is appropriate and consistent with section 6(b)(3) of the Act which requires that the rules of the exchange assures a fair representation of its members in the selection of its directors and administration of its affairs. <FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 14 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> The Commission notes that the proposal could allow the annual election meeting to take place prior to the annual report meeting. Before setting the meeting times, the Exchange should consider that the report meeting may provide information to members that is relevant to their election of Governors at the annual election meeting. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

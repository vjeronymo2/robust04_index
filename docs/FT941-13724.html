			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / World Bond Markets: Danish rhetoric becomes reality - Capital &amp; Credit Mr Erik Hoffmeyer, Denmark's veteran central bank governor, must be singing in his sauna. He is the toast of the financial markets following his success in restoring confidence in the Danish krone, one of the main casualties of the collapse of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism last August, a feat which has given him the freedom to cut Danish interest rates independently of the German Bundesbank. Indeed, the 69-year-old tree lover, who is due to retire at the end of this year after 29 years at the helm of the central bank, has such confidence in the krone's renewed stability that he said on television two weeks ago Danish interest rates could drop as low as US levels - now around 3 per cent. His predictions, coupled with the rosy outlook for inflation and economic growth in Denmark, had the same effect on the Danish government bond market as waving a red flag in front of a bull. According to Unibors Securities, yields on 10-year Danish government bonds dropped 25 basis points to a record low of 5.89 per cent soon after Mr Hoffmeyer's comments. At the same time, the yield differential between German and Danish 10-year government bonds narrowed to less than 30 basis points from 55 basis points two weeks earlier. However, the market appears to have cold feet now Mr Hoffmeyer's rhetoric is starting to become a reality. After last week's widely-expected quarter-point cut in Denmark's discount rate to 5.75 per cent, which brought it in line with Germany's discount rate, yields on 10-year Danish government bonds widened to 6 per cent. In addition, the krone failed to strengthen following the rate cut, breaking a trend to which the market had become accustomed since the ERM collapse. Mr Richard Gilhooly, international economist at Kidder Peabody in London, points out that a further independent rate cut in Denmark could prompt investors to switch into German government bonds, attracted by the higher yield and greater currency stability. Analysts at Unibors have also taken the view that the short-term limit for the Danish bond market has been reached. 'Irrespective of the current positive features of the Danish economy, most economic fundamentals point to a widening of the Danish-German yield spread and not to a further narrowing,' Unibors says in its latest weekly review of Scandinavian bond markets. They believe the Danish central bank will use any bouts of D-Mark weakness to ease monetary policy further, which would push the Danish discount rate through the German level. But they warn that this situation would be reversed once the German economy showed signs of recovery, which would strengthen the D-Mark's status as the anchor currency within the ERM. Other analysts are confident there are more gains to be made in the Danish bond market this year. Mr Neil Williams, senior economist at Daiwa Europe in London, forecasts a further cut of 150 basis points in the Danish discount rate by mid-year, which would result in Danish government bond yields dropping below Germany's by five to 10 basis points. 'Denmark is likely to be a rising star in the first half of this year,' he says. Mr Keld Holm, head of research at Bikuben Securities in Copenhagen, expects the narrowing of the yield differential between Germany and Denmark to stabilise at current levels in the short term but to narrow to about 25 basis points by mid-year. Mr Holm is pinning his hopes on the Danish central bank's ability to safeguard the krone's stability and to pursue its aggressive monetary policy. In light of Mr Hoffmeyer's recent comments, which suggest he might want to have some fun in his final year, they could well come true.</p>

			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: Income fund THE DESIRE of many investors for a high income continues to prompt financial services groups to launch products to satisfy that need. Morgan Grenfell has produced a fund with a similar structure to Hypo Foreign &amp; Colonial's Higher Income Plan, which attracted Pounds 270m earlier this year. It will pay 10 per cent a year, which can be tax-free in a Personal Equity Plan. The High Income Trust will invest in a combination of UK shares, cash and loan securities - these are the heart of the product. They are, in essence, a 'cover' for the trust's real business - writing options against the fund's shares in order to earn extra income. An option gives the buyer the right to buy, or sell, a given commodity at a set price over a set period. In return for this right, the option buyer pays a premium to the seller, or writer. These premiums will represent the extra income of Morgan Grenfell's trust. The loan securities are designed to get round unit trust regulations, which do not allow managers to distribute option profits to unitholders. The 'interest' income on the loans will effectively be the premium income repackaged. Writing options means that the trust is giving up future capital gains for immediate income. But if it can deliver 10 per cent a year, many investors will probably not mind. The normal rule of thumb is that a high return, such as 10 per cent, can only be achieved at a high risk. Although Morgan Grenfell is not offering any guarantees, it says the fund will provide protection against a sharp fall in the market, and the product will not eat up capital to get income. If Hypo F &amp; C and Morgan Grenfell can earn 10 per cent for investors (after charges) without taking much of a risk, it suggests there is a pricing anomaly in the market, which might eventually disappear. But private investors cannot hope to understand the intricacies of the options market; they simply have to trust that major groups such as Morgan Grenfell and Hypo F &amp; C can deliver what they have promised. Certainly, nothing has gone wrong with the Hypo F &amp; C fund so far. For those prepared to take a lower level of income, Morgan Grenfell is offering a balanced investment, with 50 per cent in the Higher Income fund and 50 per cent in its existing UK Equity Income fund. This option will pay 7 per cent and give the investor the chance of capital growth; the UK Equity income fund achieved growth of 90.8 per cent over the five years to September 1. The minimum investment in Morgan Grenfell's 10 per cent plan is Pounds 1,000 (Pounds 2,500 for Peps). The charges will be 5 per cent initial and 1.5 per cent annual. For those who want the 7 per cent income (also Pepable), the minimum investment is Pounds 2,000; the charges are 5.25 per cent initial and 1.5 per cent annual. In both cases, income will be paid quarterly. Meanwhile, Hypo F &amp; C is offering an offshore option of its Higher Income plan. This will pay income gross and non-taxpayers can thus earn 10 per cent on sums far larger than the annual Pounds 6,000 Pep allowance. The minimum investment is Pounds 5,000; initial charge is 5 per cent and annual is 1.5 per cent.</p>

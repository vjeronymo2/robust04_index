			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Arif Useinov: "The Mirage of Kuwait"] </F>   [Text] Baku -- The Caspian could turn into a settling tank  if, in the quest for foreign contracts, the champions of  national interests do not concern themselves with the fate of  its ecosystem.    A meeting of leaders and experts from oil companies in  Istanbul was devoted to the development of oil and gas deposits  on the Caspian shelf. Azerbaijan intends to sign it in the next  few weeks [sentence as published]. However, within the flow of  news anticipating the upcoming ceremonies, notes of alarm and  bitterness have appeared in the local press in the past few  days, going as far as the stunning news that the deal might not  take place at all.    Attention is focused on commentary concerning the Russian  Federation's official position in respect of the legal base of  the agreements being concluded with foreign companies in states  around the Caspian in the absence of a status for the Caspian  itself. The matter boils down to questions which Russia raised  both a year ago and two years ago: It is necessary to determine  the status of the Caspian -- legal, economic, environmental, and  other norms for the joint use of this unique body of water and  the rights and responsibility of all the Caspian states and each  of them individually. The problem is undoubtedly debatable,  extremely complex, and historically unclear. It appears that  the most reasonable thing to do is to convene an international  conference on the Caspian under the aegis of the United Nations,  which would in fact settle all the controversial questions,  including the most burning one -- whether to consider the  Caspian to be a sea or a lake.    It is quite lawful that, following the first contract of the  century -- the "Tengiz" deal -- Russia deemed it necessary to  express its stance on the second one, work on which is now being  conducted in Istanbul. In principle, this concerns all  agreements on the Caspian which have been concluded or are in  the preparation stage, because the worsening environmental  crisis, the high concentration of harmful substances, and  likewise the uncontrolled fishing, equally concern Turkmenistan,  Kazakhstan, Iran, and Azerbaijan. Russia is not making an  exception for itself: It has temporarily closed down the  already developed oil deposits in the waters of Dagestan until  the status of the Caspian is determined and a principle for  dividing its wealth is elaborated.    That is roughly how the Russian Federation embassy in Baku  explained the situation, expressing regret that the normal  notification through diplomatic channels of one state's stance  to another -- a major company of which, British Petroleum, will  conduct the development of deposits on the Azerbaijani section  of the Caspian shelf -- was greeted with excessive suspicion.  Furthermore, the opposition press was bursting with indignation,  trying to accuse Russia of putting pressure on Azerbaijan and  wanting to confirm its diktat over the Caspian. And, as usual,  this question is being seen in the context of a Russian plan to  settle the Karabakh conflict. The point of the reaction is  clear: Pressure is being applied from the left and from the  right. The official point of view, which leaves no room for  doubt, is: It is more obvious to us with whom we should conduct  talks, and what contracts should be concluded and on what terms.    The British Petroleum office in Baku also did its bit,  explaining that before the talks began the company studied all  the visible and invisible legal aspects connected with the  preparation of the contract.    Observers, however, are unanimous in their opinion: Russia's  position should not be ignored -- it concerns the fate of the  Caspian as a whole, which is incomparable with the advantage of  any one of the contracts. It is no secret that the closed  ecosystem is gradually turning into a scrap heap and settling  tank. During the latest storm everything is getting muddled up.  Just try to distinguish where the most dangerous substances  have been discharged -- in Sumgait or on the Turkmen coast. Not  one Caspian state wants to bear the responsibility for the  damage done. That is precisely what has dictated Russia's  entirely reasonable concern about how the new developments,  which notably rule out environmental control, will affect the  state of the Caspian. Iran and Turkmenistan, remember, are also  conducting work to develop the oil deposits on its parts of the  Caspian shelf.    Yes, the temptation of competing with Kuwait in terms of  wealth, obtaining fantastic profits, and reviving the national  economy is great. All this, however, should not rule out  responsibility for the fate of the Caspian. Russia, as one of  the Caspian states, (for the sake of the common good) does not  want the sea shores to turn into a settling tank. However, the  champions of national interests, who have been carried away by  discussions on geopolitical themes, have not paid due attention  to this. What are the interests of future generations to them:  After all, all their time, it appears, is being spent in  conjecture about renewed Russian expansion. Obviously, this is  a shame.</p>

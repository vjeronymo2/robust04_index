If  the U.S. president really made this statement, and there are  indications that he did, this means that the current U.S.  Administration has adopted a stance contrary to official U.S.  positions on Jerusalem advocated by previous administrations.  In addition such a stance is a flagrant violation of  international legitimacy and resolutions relating to the  Arab-Israeli conflict.    This stance also affirms that the U.S. Administration cannot  play the role of honest broker in the peace talks, especially  when the Palestinian-Israeli accord has clearly specified that  the status of Jerusalem will be at the top of the list of issues  to be discussed during the final stage talks between the  Palestinian and Israeli sides.    This position, attributed to Clinton, was preceded by the  U.S. abstention in the Security Council vote on a clause  affirming that Jerusalem was part of the occupied Palestinian  territories. The vote was within context of a resolution on the  al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. On this basis, Clinton's recent  statement is not separate from the U.S. position's farce in the  Security Council during the deliberations over the massacre and  from what he stated during his election campaign.    Therefore, those voices which considered Clinton's  statements  during the election campaign as being mere lip service to gain  the American Jewish vote in the elections should now realize  their mistake. They should also realize that what is happening  now is a clear shift in the U.S. position -- one that seeks to  be in harmony with the Israeli position and that ignores and  denies the rights of the Palestinian people and the Arab and  Islamic nations in Jerusalem.    In sum, a U.S. stance that is so clear and grave on a  central  problem in the Arab-Israeli conflict calls for a serious  assessment of the U.S. role in the peace talks. The U.S.  Administration's continued fulfillment of the sponsor's role in  the peace talks while adopting Israel's positions means that it  has lost any credibility in playing such a role and that it has  lost the legitimacy of intervening in the talks, especially as  it has defied international legitimacy and its resolutions, on  which the foundations of the peace process are based.</p>

			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / International Company News: KIO plans write-off of Grupo Torras debt The Kuwait Investment Office (KIO) plans to write-off Pta184.4bn (Dollars 1.4bn) to bring its Spanish holding, Grupo Torras, out of receivership under the terms of a settlement proposed to minority creditors. The development represents the formal acknowledgement by the KIO and by its parent, the Kuwait Investment Authority (KIA), of Kuwait's continued interest in Grupo Torras despite a legal feud between former and present managers of the company that led to an application by Grupo Torras for protection against its creditors in December 1992. The proposed write-off is the equivalent of 90 per cent of the Pta205.4bn owed by Grupo Torras to KIO/KIA, a debt total that represents 93.5 per cent of the total sum owed by the Spanish company to its creditors. The remaining 6.5 per cent of the debt, representing Pta14.4bn, is highly dispersed among financial and public institutions and among bond holders. The settlement proposes a sliding scale: minor creditors, owed less than Pta1m, would be repaid 97 per cent of their loan to Grupo Torras within three months; Creditors who lent between Pta100m and Pta1bn are being asked to write-off 80 per cent of their loans and will be repaid the balance within six months. The creditors have until January 21 to approve the settlement but this approval is a mere formality for under Spanish law such an agreement requires a favourable vote representing 75 per cent of the debt owed, a proportion that is well below the threshold of the direct Kuwait loans to Grupo Torras. The chief beneficiaries of the KIO's proposed write-off will be Torraspapel, a paper group owned by Grupo Torras, and Ercros, the holding's fertiliser division. Both companies were placed into receivership before Grupo Torras itself collapsed and they have since received considerable financial backing from the KIO.</p>

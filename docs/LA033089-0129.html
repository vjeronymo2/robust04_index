			<p><P> March 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. WAIVES TENANT LAWS TO AID VIRGINIA BATTLE AGAINST DRUGS IN PUBLIC HOUSING  </P> <P> Troubled by the growing prevalence of drug trafficking in housing projects, the  Bush Administration Wednesday officially exempted the state of Virginia from  federal tenant-protection laws as part of an aggressive new effort to evict  drug dealers from the nation's public housing.  </P> <P> The unprecedented move, among the most far-reaching of the Administration's new  anti-drug initiatives, faces an almost-certain legal challenge. But  Administration officials defended the action, saying that it affords tenants  adequate legal protections.  </P> <P> As Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Jack Kemp proclaimed that the  eviction of drug dealers is among his "top priorities," sources close to him  said that it is likely the new tactic will be extended far beyond Virginia,  which was granted an informal exemption late Tuesday night.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Response to Shoot-Out  </P> <P> That action came in response to a shoot-out in Alexandria that left a policeman  and a drug suspect dead and a neighborhood traumatized in an outbreak of  drug-related violence that officials fear has become all too characteristic of  the nation's housing projects.  </P> <P> The exemption from the federal statutes gives Virginia public housing officials  the power to evict drug dealers and users without first resorting to  administrative proceedings that can delay action for months. Tenants who seek  to challenge eviction orders must now appeal directly to the courts.  </P> <P> Civil libertarians and tenants' rights advocates denounced the move, saying  that it could deprive innocent people of shelter. They noted that a federal  court in Washington last year overruled a Ronald Reagan Administration attempt  to streamline the eviction procedures and charged that the latest move violates  that court order.  </P> <P> But public housing administrators across the country welcomed the move and many  said that they would ask Kemp for similar powers.  </P> <P> "As long as we've got drugs," said Chicago Housing Authority chairman Vince  Evans, "life in the projects will be hell."  </P> <P> Authorities in Alexandria used their new power immediately to evict 41  suspected drug dealers and their families. "I just want them out of the city,"  said Mayor James P. Moran.  </P> <P> Administration officials said they would decide whether to grant further  exemptions after considering proposals from cities and states as part of a  review conducted by Kemp and William J. Bennett, director of national drug  control policy.  </P> <P> They said that the government would move to speed the eviction process only in  areas in which state law provides tenants with adequate protection. A spokesman  for Kemp, Mary Brunette, emphasized that the federal exemption "certainly does  not exempt states from going through the normal appeals procedure" to address  tenant grievances.  </P> <P> The goal of the new crackdown, Kemp said in a statement, is to "clean the drugs  out of public housing and to help reclaim these communities for law-abiding  public citizens."  </P> <P> Public housing officials interviewed Wednesday said that the pervasiveness of  drugs and violence in housing projects across the country has come to dominate  life within them. Even in affluent Alexandria, Moran noted, "tenants feared for  their lives and had difficulty keeping their children from being involved in  drugs."  </P> <P> At the Hopkins-Tancil Court housing project there, where the shooting took  place, residents said Monday that while they want drug dealers to be evicted,  they worry that residents not involved in drug activity also could lose their  homes.  </P> <P> "Innocent people could get thrown out," said Pernell Taylor, who has lived in  the project for 12 years. "It's ruination to them."  </P> <P> In most states, authorities can move to evict a suspected drug dealer from  public housing on the basis of a single arrest on a drug-related offense and  need not await a conviction. In most cases, the evicted individual's family  also loses the right to housing.  </P> <P> Until now, such action could be appealed first in the federal administrative  process and then in the state courts. Because Wednesday's decision on Virginia  removes the federal step from the appeals process, housing advocates said they  were concerned that housing authorities might now be encouraged to act too  hastily.  </P> <P> "It's one thing to bypass the grievance process when you're trying to evict an  individual who is selling drugs," said David Bryson of the National Housing Law  Center. "It's another thing when you try to evict the whole family because an  individual in the family has done something wrong."  </P> <P> The law center successfully blocked the previous effort to speed evictions,  winning a temporary restraining order in federal court here early this year  that invalidated new regulations proposed by the Reagan Administration.  </P> <P> Bryson said that he believes the Bush Administration's granting of exemptions  was merely a new attempt to implement the rules rejected by the court. But  Brunette, the Kemp spokesman, said that the Administration is confident its  action will be upheld.  </P> <P> Staff writer Brian J. Couturier contributed to this article.  </P></p>

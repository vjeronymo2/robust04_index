Between late last year and Jan. 22, Radio Pyongyang aired a  10-part lecture by a Kim Il-song University professor on  "Several Problems Found in South Korea's Labor Movement,"  according to the official North Korea watcher, NAEWOE press.    The lecture was apparently aimed at stirring up social  unrest  in South Korea, as South Korean workers showed signs of  cooperating with their employers to achieve industrial peace in  support of President Kim Yong-sam's policy on increasing  international competitiveness of South Korean products under his  new five-year economic development plan, analysts say.    The lecturer, noting "a temporary retreat by the South  Korean  labor movement," said different views and theories voiced in the  course of making a decision on the movement's direction should  be blamed for this retreat and stressed the need for "a militant  strike struggle."    Also, the Workers' (communist) Party newspaper, NODONG  SINMUN, in a commentary carried in the Jan. 31 issue severely  criticized President Kim Yong-sam for seeking industrial peace  in recent meetings with business leaders, and urged South Korean  workers and citizens to launch a struggle to overthrow the Kim  Yong-sam government.    The Radio Pyongyang lecturer, defining workers as "the  leaders of a South Korean revolution," said the South Korean  proletariat's political line of action should be based on  Korean's "chuche" (self- reliance) socialism rooted in the  masses, adding that "chuche" thought should be "the guiding  ideology of South Korea's labor movement."    Claiming that South Korea's labor movement has problems due  to conflicting opinions in the leadership, he said "Kim  Chong-il, the sagacious revolutionary leader, has provided the  most scientific solutions to these problems."    In the fifth part of the lecture, noting that there are two  theories in the South Korean labor movement--one for national  unification based on proletariat liberation and the other for  democratization before unification--he said both are wrong  because they belittle the importance of the unification issue.    South Korea's labor movement should focus its political  struggle on the unification issue because in South Korea's  "colonial society under foreign imperialist rule, proletariat  liberation and democratization cannot be achieved without  national liberation from the imperialist colonial rule."    North Korea, seeing "the struggle for national unification"  as being on a par with "the struggle against foreign aggressors  and proletariat liberation struggle" calls on South Korean  workers to fight for national independence and proletariat  liberation. It also calls for united front of "all patriotic  forces through struggle against foreign rule and dictatorship,"  as seen in the eighth part of the lecture.    According to this lecture, South Korea's labor movement  should practice sabotage, strikes, demonstrations and riots,  which should be employed not only in political and economic  struggles but also in violent and non-violent struggles, lawful  and unlawful struggles and large-and small-scale struggles.    The preference for one of the political and economic  struggles over the other is "a leftist tendency," which South  Korean workers must cope with "by equipping themselves with the  labor movement methodology based on 'chuche' though to combine  both political and economic struggles on an equal footing."    "The enthusiasm and mood of the masses aroused through the  economic struggle must be directed to the struggle for political  objectives," the lecturer said.    For instance, South Korean workers must direct the struggle  for economic goals, such as wage hikes, improved working  conditions and tax cuts, to that for the political goals of the  release of political prisoners, revision of labor laws, freedom  to organize trade unions, withdrawal of U.S. troops and  overthrow of the government, he said.    To lead such a labor movement, the lecturer stressed the  need  for South Korea's workers to develop leaders of such dissident  groups as the National Council of Trade Unions, the National  Association of Industrial Unions and the Hyundai Group Trade  Union Federation as a strong driving force.    This will help develop South Korea's labor movement into a  strong political force, an important strategic goal, under the  influence of the workers' party.    In the face of "the Fascist puppet regime's oppression," the  South Korean proletariat must employ lawful, semi-lawful and  unlawful approaches to organizing its own political party, he  stressed.    In the final and 10th part of the lecture, the lecturer said  strikes are the basic instrument for workers to achieve their  objectives and commended South Korea's dissident unions for  their leadership in past strikes.    The lecture was designed to create social and economic  confusion and unrest in South Korea by instigating South Korean  workers to take to the streets in a struggle against the Kim  Yong-sam government's plan to increase competitiveness of South  Korean goods in overseas market.</p>

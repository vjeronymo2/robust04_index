			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Small steps into export markets - Stephen Halliday explains how everyone can afford vital market research SMALL enterprises throughout the EC are less well prepared for the single market than their larger brethren. A survey in Germany indicates that even in Europe's biggest exporting nation, small to medium sized enterprises are less well prepared than larger companies. In the last four years there have been many schemes in the UK designed to increase awareness of the implications of the single market. The DTI's 'Business Initiative' campaign has been the most heavily promoted but there have been many others inspired by trade associations, chambers of commerce, small companies groups and some of the Training and Enterprise Councils. The proliferation of such schemes may be a problem in itself. There is evidence that businesses are confused by the multiplicity of information sources available. Even large companies have difficulty finding their way through the maze of information sources, so it is scarcely surprising that smaller organisations prefer to stay at home and shun export trade missions, letters of credit, currency hedging and joint ventures. The situation is easier for small businesses in France where Chambers of Commerce, with their roots in local communities, are responsible for much of the activity which in Britain is spread across many different agencies. In France all but the smallest traders are obliged to belong the Chamber of Commerce to which they must pay a levy. The Chambers run business schools, conduct market research, organise conferences, act as lobbyists for industry and promote exports. A chamber will, typically, have responsibility for a certain industry and a certain part of the world. Thus, 22 of them specialise in the UK market. The decision of the DTI to fund six 'one-stop shops' for advice is an attempt to overcome the problems caused by the proliferation of advice centres. Any small company which is considering breaking into an export market is well advised to engage experienced consultants to carry out the preparatory work. This will include assessing the market potential, discovering regulatory or technical requirements of the proposed market and evaluating possible distributors, agents or partners in a joint venture. Many small firms are put off by the costs associated with such consultants, although the DTI will, in many cases, pay half the cost of such research when it is undertaken by firms with fewer than 200 employees. The cost can be further reduced by employing some highly professional, low cost market research enterprises which are run in conjunction with university courses. The oldest of these is Scanmark at Buckinghamshire Business School, a college of Brunel University, which has been undertaking export market research for 20 years. It was conceived as a method of sharpening the marketing and linguistic skills of students on a post-graduate course in export marketing. Past projects have included a survey of molecular biology techniques in three European Countries; an appraisal of the European market for artificial sweeteners and the identification of suitable joint venture partners for a small company distributing pharmaceuticals in Europe. Fees have ranged from less than Pounds 200 to Pounds 20,000 - the latter for a study of the European market for artists' materials. They so low because the fees cover travelling and living. Students with government grants would jeopardise their status if they worked for profit. One disappointing feature of the operation is the reluctance of smaller companies to undertake market research. Most Scanmark customers are large companies such as Pepsi-Cola, Gillette and Chubb. There seems to be a deeply held belief among small businesses that market research is something only large companies can do, especially if it involves talking to foreigners. It can be difficult to convey that big companies grew big by undertaking research into market opportunities. Good market research is within the reach of any business that is serious about exporting because of The DTI's Export Marketing Research scheme. There are two other options. One is to go ahead without doing the research which will probably lead to failure and possibly to ruin. The second is simply to ignore the opportunity of breaking into new markets, which is what most smaller companies do. Sue Rush, who completed the Scanmark programme in 1984, said: 'It's not only the giants of industry who need to understand their customers' requirements but all those who are in business to make money'.

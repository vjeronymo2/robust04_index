			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As required by 49 CFR section 543.6(a)(4), the agency also finds that BMW has provided adequate reasons for its belief that the modified antitheft device will reduce and deter theft. This conclusion is based on the information BMW provided on its device. This information included a description of reliability and functional tests conducted by BMW for the antitheft device and its components.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 49 CFR section 543.9(h)(2)(ii) permits the agency to establish an effective date for the modification of the antitheft device earlier than ``the model year following the model year in which NHTSA issued the modification decision'' upon a showing of good cause by the manufacturer that an earlier effective date for modifying its exemption is consistent with the public interest and purposes of 49 U.S.C. section 33106. In its petition, BMW stated that making the modification of its antitheft system effective beginning with MY 1995 is in the public interest since it would permit expeditious manufacture and sale of vehicles with the modified antitheft system as standard equipment. BMW stated the 1989 theft data published by NHTSA in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (56 FR 7444, February 22, 1991) show that the BMW 7 Car line had a theft rate of 3.9505 per thousand vehicles stolen, somewhat above the 1983/84 median theft rate of 3.2712. BMW stated its belief that the antitheft device proposed for the MY 1995 7 Car line, with improvements that enhance the effectiveness of the antitheft system, will lower the 7 Car line's theft rate. NHTSA has reviewed this showing of ``good cause'' and finds that making the modification of BMW's petition effective beginning with the 1995 model year is consistent with the public interest and 49 U.S.C. section 33106.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the foregoing reasons, the agency hereby exempts the BMW 7 Car line that is the subject of this notice, in whole, from the requirements of 49 CFR part 541.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If, in the future, BMW decides not to use the exemption for the car line that is the subject of this notice, it should formally notify the agency. If such a decision is made, the car line must be fully marked according to the requirements under 49 CFR section 541.5 and section 541.6 (marking of major component parts and replacement parts).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency notes that the limited and apparently conflicting data on the effectiveness of the pre-standard parts marking programs continue to make it difficult to compare the effectiveness of an antitheft device with the effectiveness of compliance with the theft prevention standard. The statute clearly invites such a comparison, which the agency has made on the basis of the limited data available. With implementation of the requirements of the ``Anti Car Theft Act of 1992,'' NHTSA anticipates more probative data upon which comparisons may be made.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA notes that if BMW wishes in the future to modify the device on which this exemption is based, the company may have to submit a petition to modify the exemption. Part 543.7(d) states that a Part 543 exemption applies only to vehicles that belong to a line exempted under this part and equipped with the antitheft device on which the line's exemption is based. Further, section 543.9(c)(2) provides for the submission of petitions ``(t)o modify an exemption to permit the use of an antitheft device similar to but differing from the one specified in that exemption.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency wishes to minimize the administrative burden which section 543.9(c)(2) could place on exempted vehicle manufacturers and itself. The agency did not intend in drafting Part 543 to require the submission of a modification petition for every change to the components or design of an antitheft device. The significance of many such changes could be  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> de minimis.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Therefore, NHTSA suggests that if the manufacturer contemplates making any changes the effects of which might be characterized as  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> de minimis, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  it should consult the agency before preparing and submitting a petition to modify.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Authority: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  49 U.S.C. 33106; delegation of authority at 49 CFR 1.50.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Issued on: September 13, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Ricardo Martinez,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Administrator  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;23093 Filed 9&hyph;16&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;59&hyph;P <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

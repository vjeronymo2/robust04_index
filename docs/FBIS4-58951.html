			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Amjad Mu'alla] </F>   [Text] A senior Yemeni official has accused foreign  quarters of interfering in Yemeni affairs in an attempt to  strike at Yemeni unity and kindle the fires of sedition by  supplying the warring factions with weapons and encouraging  fighting. He appealed to the political forces in Aden and the  Governorate of Lahij, stronghold of the Yemeni Socialist Party  [YSP], to move in order to decisively settle matters in favor of  the Armed Forces. He stressed that the current fighting is an  internal affair and there is no room for foreign mediation.    Reached by telephone in Sanaa, Mazhar al-Taqiy,  undersecretary of the Yemeni Information Ministry, told  AL-DUSTUR that large quantities of weapons were seized at sea  and airports. He added that the Yemeni authorities confiscated  military communications equipment, bugging devices, and certain  missile batteries aboard a Boeing 707 about one month ago.  Everything was purchased from a British company and the plane  belonged to an Ugandan airline company. He said large  quantities of light weapons were found and confiscated from the  Yemeni Socialist Party headquarters in Sanaa in the last few  days.    Al-Taqiy questioned the YSP motives behind the possession of  these quantities of weapons and said no state can allow a local  party to import weapons for itself or form its own army and  militias. He said that importing weapons in such quantities  clearly indicates that foreign quarters do not want to see unity  or democracy in Yemen as these act like an earthquake to foreign  forces.    Regarding the latest developments in Yemen, al-Taqiy said  the  Armed Forces are on their way to end what he termed a rebellion  led by an adventurous group in the YSP leadership. He added  that the Armed Forces, which represent the constitutional  legitimacy and belong to the various governorates in the  Republic, are 15 km from the city of Aden and will enter and  take control of it.    Mazhar al-Taqiy added that yesterday a large number of the  forces that had been stationed in the southeastern Sunaywah  [name as transliterated]. Governorate joined the Yemeni Army,  bringing their equipment and weapons.    Al-Taqiy said Yemen still rejects mediation to stop the  fighting, citing the statements of Yemeni President 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih to the House of Representatives on 7 May,  deeming the situation in Yemen an internal affair.    The Yemeni Information Ministry under secretary cited  President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's assertion that unity will not  be abandoned, whatever the cost, and that the rebellious  leadership in the YSP should surrender to the legitimate  authority.    He said: We expect the unionists in the YSP and other Aden  residents to take control of the situation, arrest the rebels  and hand them over to the legitimate authority.    Answering a question as to whether there have been attempts  by some Arab parties to mediate, al-Taqiy said: "Mediation  between whom? What is happening now is that a group that has  defied constitutional legitimacy has ignited a war in several  regions in Yemen. We ask any side that wants to mediate if it  would accept mediation if one of its parties were to ignite an  internal war."    He added: We think that this is purely an internal affair  and that the rebels should respect constitutional legitimacy and  the state institutions established in accordance with the  elections on 27 April 1993. They should submit to legitimacy,  and then everything will return to the way it was before.    While observing the developments in fraternal Yemen,  AL-DUSTUR has also tried to contact Yemeni officials in Aden.  However, they could not be reached because telephone links with  Aden have been cut.</p>

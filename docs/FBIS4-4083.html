			<p>BFN     [Text] In the first quarter, our province's economy  maintained its proper growth. From January to March, the GDP of  the whole province reached 23.855 billion yuan, an increase of  9.5 percent over same period last year, if calculated in terms  of comparable prices. Primary industry increased by 5.2  percent, secondary industry by 13 percent, and tertiary industry  by 8.4 percent. Our reporter learned this from a news briefing  held by the provincial statistics bureau.    During the first quarter, industrial production and sales  maintained a faster growth. Total production output value of  industrial enterprises at and above the township level reached  21.183 billion yuan, registering an increase of 13.3 percent  over same period last year. Output value of light industry was  8.65 billion yuan, up 12.9 percent. Output value of heavy  industry reached 12.533 billion yuan, a rise of 13.6 percent.    Total production output value of agriculture reached 7.51  billion yuan, an increase of 9.2 percent over the corresponding  period last year. During the first quarter, total production  output value of town and township enterprises amounted to 27.324  billion yuan, 90.1 percent more than that of the same period  last year. The increase in fixed-asset investment rose to 2.229  billion yuan, an increase of 50.1 percent over the same period  last year.    The consumer goods market was very active. During the first  quarter, retail sales of social consumer goods reached 13.642  billion yuan, up 21 percent over the corresponding period last  year. Buying and selling was down on the means-of-production  market.    During the first quarter, the following problems also  existed  in the economic situation throughout the province: 1)  Consumption funds grew too rapidly, causing commodity prices to  increase by a wider margin; 2) Enterprises' economic efficiency  dropped, the deficits of industries with poor performance  increased, and the amount of their losses rose by a wider  margin; 3) Contradictions between supply and demand of funds  still existed, affecting the production and operations of some  enterprises.</p>

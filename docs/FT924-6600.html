			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Barrett brothers lead Pounds 15m buy-out THE CORE businesses of Henry Barrett Group, the Bradford-based company which went into receivership last week, have been sold in a management buy-out worth Pounds 15m. A new company, Barrett Steels, has acquired the group's steel stockholding and steel buildings businesses, employing 450 people and still trading profitably, with a combined annual turnover of Pounds 62m. Mr James Barrett and his brother, Richard, members of the group's founding family, will lead the buy-out, which has been backed by Granville Development Capital and Apax Partners. The team is paying the receivers, Grant Thornton, Pounds 12m. The new company has been financed by Pounds 6m equity, Pounds 6m in term loans and a Pounds 3m working capital facility. Mr Allan Griffiths, one of the receivers, said that as well as paying the purchase price, the new company would assume about Pounds 17m of the parent group's total debts of Pounds 40m-Pounds 45m. Mr Griffiths said it was an unusual situation, in that talks regarding sales of the two businesses were well advanced when the receivers arrived, keeping the companies out of receivership. The two companies had been extensively marketed over the summer and received several bids, of which the existing management's was the highest. The receivers soon hope to sell Lindapter, the group's special fastenings company, which was also kept out of receivership. Touche Ross in Leeds acted as lead financial advisers to the management and Simpson Curtis were legal advisers. KPMG Peat Marwick gave financial advice to the investors and Evershed Hepworth and Chadwick were legal advisers. Henry Barrett was floated in 1987 and undertook an aggressive diversification policy to reduce its dependence on steel. The buy-out team said the parent company's financial difficulties were due largely to the underperformance of these acquisitions.</p>

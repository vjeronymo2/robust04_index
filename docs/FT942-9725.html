			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Rumours push drachma down The Greek drachma came under strong pressure yesterday, losing ground against the D-Mark following rumours that the government plans to lift controls on short-term capital movement ahead of its July 1 deadline. The market has been jittery for several days as reports emerged of discussions between central bank and economy ministry officials in preparation for lifting foreign exchange restrictions. The drachma closed at DM148.10, down from Dr147.5 the previous day. Dealers said it had cost the Bank of Greece some DM500m (Pounds 200m) to prop up the drachma yesterday after the German currency reached record levels elsewhere in Europe on Thursday, when Greek markets were closed for a public holiday. Greece was granted an 18-month extension on lifting all foreign exchange curbs in line with European Union rules. The main restriction still to be removed is a ban on drachma lending for periods of less than three months. The government is concerned about both speculative attacks against the drachma in the run-up to July 1 and the possibility of a sudden capital outflow as soon as restrictions are lifted. It faces difficulties in financing a rising public deficit. It currently has to raise more than Dr150bn each month through issues of short-term Treasury bills. Greece's public debt is the highest in the EU, at almost 140 per cent of gross domestic product. However, a senior Bank of Greece official said yesterday that the July deadline was 'still in place, with neither delays nor an early lifting of restrictions in sight'. The interbank three-month rate briefly touched 26 per cent yesterday, against 21.6 per cent on Wednesday. The timing yesterday of the central bank's announcement that it was imposing a 9 per cent reserve requirement on bank deposits held by public sector enterprises, in accordance with EU rules, contributed to the overall anxiety. The Athens stock market was also affected; the index fell 1.74 per cent yesterday.</p>

Thus, a new alliance between the  Muslims and Serbs is possible. It would be a logical alliance,  because the Serbs and the Muslims are to a certain degree  natural allies since they have both a mutual enemy (the Croats)  and a mutual long-term interest, which is an outlet to the  Croatian sea [as published]. [passage omitted]    This is why the pressure to obtain this outlet on the  Croatian sea will become more pronounced and more intense. The  sea has a mythical significance; it is an unavoidable element in  the process of creating statehood. For the Serbs, it is indeed  a century-old dream which today could possibly be achieved. In  1878, when Serbia was recognized as an independent state, it was  still very far from the sea--it was separated from it by  Sandzak, Montenegro, Kosovo and Metohija, Albania, and Macedonia  (Turkey). The same year, Austria occupied Bosnia-Herzegovina,  and Serbia lost the possibility of resolving the issue of access  to the sea through this "Serbian land." Thus, the moment of  Serbia's greatest affirmation (creation of the state) was linked  to its greatest frustration, which Serbia has carried as an  undescribable burden until today. For the Muslims, too, the  outlet to the sea means a final affirmation of their statehood,  and they will not renounce this goal very easily. [passage  omitted] The Muslim-Serb alliance will thus receive a special  momentum when the republic of Srpska, with the Muslims' consent,  leaves Bosnia-Herzegovina. Then the Muslim-Serb conflict and  problem can be viewed as resolved, which means a new possibility  for their alliance. [passage omitted]    This is why the Republic of Croatia and the Croats in  Bosnia-Herzegovina must, above all, be decisive in not  surrendering the sovereignty of their coast and must be ready to  defend this sovereignty even with military force. Likewise, in  the political sense, the Croats must, during the negotiations,  be on the offensive, i.e. they must request part of Sarajevo,  because "they need it," and, of course, that part of Sarajevo in  which there are no Croats at all, just as the others are  demanding a part of the coast where there are no Muslims or  Serbs. Does this sound strange? No, not at all--it only sounds  logical and just.</p>

ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI recalls that "the leaders of parliamentary  groups who voted for a political amnesty explained the need for  it by striving to maintain civil peace".    However, "it appears evident that the release of the  'political prisoners' not just stimulate the activities of the  hardline opposition -- it will entail the emergence of quite a  number of organisations whose activities would be quite capable  of destabilisiing the situation in the country".    In addition, the situation is also being compounded by the  fact that the Lefortovo investigation ward inmates and forces  supporting them have no representation in parliament, for  well-known reasons. "This is precisely why their struggle for  the division of political space may become particularly fierce".    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA frontpages an analytical article under  the headline "The Opposition Has Got Competitors From Lefortovo.  The President Begins To Regroup Forces".    Recalling the events of the October last year in Moscow, the  newspaper points out that "the developments connected with the  release of the 'Oktobrists' have vividly shown the extent of  contradictions that tear the presidential team asunder".    "Of course, the State Duma decision about an amnesty hardly  gave pleasure to the president. However, there is every  indication that those presidential team members who believed  that the 'Oktobrists' are much more dangerous in the symbolical  image of martyrs than in the image of real political figures  gained the upper hand".    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on former Vice-President Aleksandr  Rutskoy: "As a politician, he undoubtedly enjoys a considerable  prestige. But one should take into account that he became the  leader of the entire opposition and a real alternative to Boris  Yeltsin by virtue of his high position, in the extreme situation  of a coup d'etat". "At present, however, opposition politicians  (Zhirinovsky, Zyuganov and Baburin) should view him, rather, as  a potential competitor: for, according to people close to  Rutskoy, he intends not only to return to politics but also  participate in the future presidential elections".    TRUD on a probable development of events in Russia following  the amnesty.    The newspaper believes that "if the political struggle  unfolds in uncivilised forms, those factions which voted for an  amnesty on the plea for a quest for civil peace would find  themselves in a rather difficult position.    "This primarily applies to the Party of Russian Unity and  Accord, whose votes enabled the duma to pass the decision on the  release of the 'Lefortovo inmates'.    "It is not ruled out that in the event of a flare-up of  extremism, the parliament will have to take some additional  measures if it comes to realise the danger posed to the country  by such a development of events".    KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA on the same subject:    "It is already evident to everyone that there can be no  question of any 'civilised forms' of political struggle.  "Moscow, which became somewhat calmer recently, will again be  divided into zones of influence while the president loses time  irretrievably and together with it the last levers of power".    PRAVDA carries an interview with State Duma Speaker Ivan  Rybkin.    In response to a question from the newspaper's correspondent  about the amnesty, Rybkin pointed out that the meaning of the  amnesty "is to give a chance to those who took a false step to  turn a new leaf at this difficult and critical time. The  purpose is to consolidate society so as to pull the country out  of chaos through common efforts".    SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA runs an interview with former speaker of  the Supreme Soviet Ruslan Khasbulatov who was released from  Lefortovo under the amnesty.    Khasbulatov touched upon some provisions of the president's  message to the Federal Assembly, pointing out that the message  consists mainly of what he, Khasbulatov, once said at congresses  of people's deputies.    "This means that the presidential team who prepared the  message accepted the Supreme Soviet evaluations. Surprising is  something else. Those people are unable to accomplish this task  by virtue of their being oriented to the destruction of Russia,  to the conduct of war against their own people".    PRAVDA carries an interview with Belarusian parliament chief  Meczeslaw Hryb who was elected to the post at the end of  January. Sharing his vision of how to take the republic's  economy out of the crisis, he said it is essential, first of  all, to restore economic ties with "ex-Soviet republics,  particularly with Russia". "Only an economic union and a common  monetary system can save the situation as I pointed out on more  than one occasion," Hryb said.</p>

			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1993 (11): Let the experts take over - Viewpoint / Contracting out is one way of passing the IT buck to people who promise to tame it.  John Kavanagh assesses the risks and benefits NO company would seriously consider devoting management and other resources to setting up and running its own electricity supply business just to meet its own needs - yet this is just what organisations in effect do with information technology (IT). That is one argument used by the increasing number of computing facilities management companies entering a market worth over Dollars 2,500m in Europe and growing by more than 20 per cent a year. Indeed, market research firm Dataquest predicts that UK spending on facilities management will overtake sales of mainframe computers within five years. Facilities management typically involves contracting out the running of computers and systems. Equipment and staff generally transfer to the supplier, although they might continue working at the customer's premises for a while. Sometimes the contract is signed with a long-term relationship in mind; but an increasing proportion of contracts involve the supplier running the existing service for three to five years while the customer moves to new technology and systems: for example from a central mainframe to a network of local minicomputers or personal computers. Even organisations with the very biggest computing units are looking at facilities management: the latest notable example is the Inland Revenue, which is examining tenders for its entire set-up of three development centres, a dozen computer centres and more than 2,300 staff. Cutting costs is not the main reason organisations go for facilities management, according to a 1993 survey by services company CMG. Its findings are confirmed by interviews carried out for this survey. The CMG survey shows the main reasons for choosing facilities management are a lack of internal skills or resources, mentioned by 36 per cent of users, the need to focus on core business activities (27 per cent), cost reductions (23 per cent) and flexibility in the use and expansion of computing (eight per cent). The survey also shows that these benefits actually happen. More than 75 per cent of users said facilities management had freed management to concentrate on core business. In addition, 70 per cent said facilities management had reduced staff numbers. Other benefits realised include greater financial control of operations (48 per cent), reduced running costs (47 per cent), the elimination of staff management problems (45 per cent), improved or guaranteed service levels (43 per cent) and the removal of staff shortages and recruitment problems (43 per cent). There were mixed results on overall cost savings: 56 per cent reported savings, 29 per cent said there was no change and 15 per cent said costs had increased. Indeed, when asked about the disadvantages of facilities management, 40 per cent of current users said there were no real cost reductions - this was the biggest single group. Even so, there were bigger votes for the benefits than for the disadvantages. Other disadvantages mentioned were difficulties in defining boundaries of responsibility (35 per cent), loss of in-house expertise (27 per cent), poor understanding by the supplier of the client's business (17 per cent), poor accountability (16 per cent) and loss of control of IT services and strategy (14 per cent). Many of these disadvantages are related and highlight the need, now being underlined by service suppliers, to regard facilities management as a partnership. All those arguments about IT being key to business strategy and competitive advantage mean contracting out this area is not as straightforward as signing away the canteen arrangements or office cleaning. 'Facilities management is gradually moving from being seen as an IT function to being regarded as a business management service,' says Mr John Rioch, head of CMG's facilities management services. 'This means users are demanding more from their supplier relationship. They require a degree of partnership, but current arrangements often fail to deliver in this respect.' This view is backed by other suppliers and confirmed by the CMG survey: less than a quarter of users said facilities management was totally integrated with theirbusiness strategy, although 48 per cent said there was partial integration. Without a strategic partnership, a company's IT is in danger of stagnating, according to Mr Geoff Symons, a partner in the Nolan, Norton division of consultancy KPMG, who advises companies considering facilities management. This is especially true when the contract includes system development. He says companies need to retain the ability to manage the service and the relationship from the customer side. Facilities management, then, must not be an abdication of management (it has been argued that FM stands for 'failed management'). Indeed, all the users interviewed for this survey have clear IT strategies in place: Westminster City Council even delayed going out to tender while it put together such a strategy. 'You must look at your management practices and your systems first,' says Mr Bob Aylott, a principal consultant at KPMG. 'If they're unstable it can be difficult to find a solid reference against which to measure the supplier's service. And you might be giving a blank cheque to the supplier to get the systems in order.' Geoff Symons says such reviews of current practice can make companies think about how the prospective supplier makes its profit - and whether its economies can be achieved in-house. However, Mr Simon Ricketts, managing director of service supplier ITnet, suggests this is unlikely - 'a big supplier can get better computer leasing and software licensing deals than individual clients,' he says. 'As specialists we work faster and more efficiently across all the client contracts. By far the biggest money maker is our tuning of the equipment to make better use of the capacity by rationalising the workload across a smaller number of machines.' Such an insight into a supplier's business is useful at the negotiation stage. 'The ability to negotiate is vital,' says Geoff Symons at KPMG. Several big suppliers argue that some companies are so keen to expand or break into this fast-growing market that they are taking contracts at an initial loss, hoping to build up other work in two or three years from the same client. There are fears that this will hit the industry's reputation. John Rioch at CMG believes the relationship and accountability problems highlighted by his company's survey justify these fears. But there is no escaping the growth of a business which is attracting customers of the size of the Inland Revenue and BP. Even the big computer manufacturers, are moving into the market to help protect their future. 'No-one has all the management skills and professional resources to be world class at everything they do,' says Mr Mark Otway, who runs FM services at Andersen Consulting. 'Contracting out is a pragmatic response to reality.' The Computing Services Association is a good first stop for companies considering facilities management. It has a client briefing note and a code of practice for suppliers and numbers all the main suppliers among its members. The association is at Hanover House, 73 High Holborn, London WC1V 6LE; telephone 071-405 2171.  ------------------------------------------        Information technology: leading       facilities management suppliers*  ------------------------------------------ Supplier                UK %     Europe %  ------------------------------------------ Hoskyns/CGS             22         10 EDS-Scicon              12         12 Sema Group              11          4 AT&amp;T Istel               9          3 Data Sciences            8          3 CFM                      5          2 Andersen Consulting      4          - DEC                      3          2 ITnet                    2          - P&amp;P                      2          -  ------------------------------------------ *Figures for 1991 Source: Input Research Group  ------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> February 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LIFE BEHIND BARS IS NO WAY TO BUILD CHARACTER;  </P> <P> CRIME: LATINO LEADERS HAVE JUMPED ON THE LAW-AND-ORDER BANDWAGON EVEN THOUGH  THAT MEANS SENDING MORE AND MORE OF THEIR OWN PEOPLE TO JAIL.  </P> <P> Latinos should take a long, hard look at the so-called "Decade of the Hispanic"  -- the 1980s -- to assess the consequences of their me-too attitude toward law  and order. Most Latino politicians have bought the idea that urban decay can be  solved by passing tougher laws and building more and bigger prisons. How else  to explain their silence when the drug war disproportionately targets young  Latinos, or their failure to question the need for more prisons.  </P> <P> A consequence of this get-along attitude toward crime, as set forth in  "Choosing Democracy," a book by Duane Campbell, is that today's entering Latino  kindergartner is as likely to go to jail as meet the admissions standards of  the state's universities.  </P> <P> Latino politicos are understandably concerned about rising crime rates in their  districts. Their law-abiding constituency is fearful and demands action. But  that's no reason for them to abandon rationality by placing their faith in a  policy of rounding 'em up and throwing 'em into jail. A large number of those  rounded up and thrown into jail are also members of their constituency.  </P> <P> By the year 2000, adults and juveniles in California prisons and local jails,  given present trends, may exceed 300,000, not quite double the current number  of 172,000. Chances are good that 50% of the new inmates will be Latino, for  several reasons: Most Latinos live in poverty and the Latino population is  relatively young -- two factors associated with crime; they lack economic  opportunity and are victims of selective law enforcement.  </P> <P> Economically, Latinos are worse off today than they were 30 years ago.  According to the 1980 Census, the earning power of a typical Latino family in  California was less than 70% of its white counterpart, down from 79% in 1960.  Latino poverty has also markedly increased.  </P> <P> As in Latin American countries, poor Latinos in the United States are growing  more dependent on an underground economy, largely fueled here by the illicit  drug trade. If current arrest and conviction trends continue, families who do  not have an ex-con relation will be rare indeed.  </P> <P> This poses troubling consequences for the moral authority of Latino parents.  When a close family member -- a son or daughter -- is arrested for drug abuse  or dealing, parents naturally are less judgmental than if the neighbor's child  is taken into custody.  </P> <P> But this attitude, however commendable, weakens their moral clout. When an  entire community is similarly afflicted, its capacity to exercise social  control is severely strained, if not moot. Outlaws are glorified as social  rebels.  </P> <P> Relying on incarceration to correct this situation is clearly misguided. Prison  life will not build Latino character. It reinforces gang identification and  encourages the growth of its associated underground subculture.  </P> <P> Ironically, Latinos more closely fit President Ronald Reagan's stereotype of  the all-American family -- hard-working, religious, extended -- than do whites.  Latinos, as a group, are more likely to have a job than any other, including  whites, according to the 1980 Census. They are poor, to be sure, but not  because they don't work. They just don't get paid decent wages.  </P> <P> Latino politicians have failed to capitalize on this important fact about their  constituents. One reason is the political mind-set born during the "Decade of  the Hispanic": Fearful of offending anyone, Latinos strove to be gentlemanly  about Latino problems; none dared call anything racist. Today, this attitude  plays right into the hands of the law-and-order crowd.  </P> <P> But the problem of crime cannot be solved so long as we place the burden of  saying "no" on a poor teen-ager who sells crack so he and his family can  participate in the "good life." For Latino politicians to believe otherwise is  a measure of how far they have strayed from addressing the needs of their  community.  </P> <P> In the end, however, this problem cannot be corrected by declaring expensive  wars at home or abroad. The jail quick-fix only works in John Wayne movies. In  reality, it feeds crime and its acceptance, and will ultimately bankrupt  California. When the state spends $3,900 a year to educate a child and roughly  $30,000 a year to keep an adult behind bars, something is out of whack.  </P></p>

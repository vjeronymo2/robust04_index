			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Aluf Ben] </F>   [Excerpt] In his upcoming visit to Washington, Prime  Minister Yitzhaq Rabin will try to persuade U.S. Administration  leaders to put off the enforcement of the new regulations on the  use of military aid and also, in the future, allow Israel to  purchase military equipment directly from U.S. firms.    Last year the Pentagon decided to ban direct military  procurement through commercial channels and compel all countries  receiving military aid to place their orders through U.S. Army  components. The decision was made in the wake of the Rami Dotan  affair in a bid to improve U.S. control over the use of aid  funds.    Israel objected to the amendment of the regulations,  claiming  it will increase costs and complicate military procurement.  Israel's supporters in Congress exerted heavy pressure and  managed to put off the enforcement of the new regulations until  June 1994. Rabin will now try to get another reprieve, and will  ask the administration to take Israel's unique needs into  consideration.    The prime minister will say Israel is prepared to make its  purchases through military channels, if in special cases it is  allowed to buy military equipment directly from the  manufacturers.    Rabin's visit in the United States will mainly be devoted to  the peace process, and security issues will not feature  prominently in his meeting with President Bill Clinton.  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Management: A wall of silence on the subject of property - Advice to companies that are mismanaging their buildings The part played by bricks and mortar in UK business is remarkable both for its importance and its inefficiency. 'Property is often a neglected asset, despite its significant contribution to running costs,' declared a recent survey commissioned by Stanhope, a property company. 'Property needs to be higher on the boardroom agenda,' concluded a report by Debenham Tewson &amp; Chinnocks, property adviser, published last week. British companies suffer some of the highest property costs in the world. Buildings typically account for 5-15 per cent of a company's operating costs, second only to the payroll in importance. Property is often more than half a company's tangible assets: UK companies owned Pounds 225bn of property in 1989. A vast number of companies have more property than they need. DTC's survey of the UK's 100 largest companies showed that 5 per cent of commercial floorspace was unused - enough to accommodate the entire working population of Bristol. For the most part, however, property receives very little attention, with the notable exception of takeover bids where property values tend to be an important battle ground. Perhaps the main explanation for this is the lowly stature of property managers. The head of property is often six or more layers down from the chief executive. Only 10 per cent of the UK's largest 100 companies employ a property director. 'In most companies, there is little or no representation of property within main boards, with the result that property is never fully considered as part of the overall business plan for the company,' says St Quintin, a firm of chartered surveyors. In some industries, the pressure to improve the efficiency of property management is intense. Retailers in the south east which have been struggling with crippling rate and rent rises are acutely aware of the need to contain property costs. Pharmaceutical companies are mindful of the value of their asset base because the regulation of drug prices is linked to their return on capital. The value of a bank's property holdings affects its capital and its ability to lend. Improving the way that property is managed is not easy. Property is notoriously illiquid and cyclical. Furthermore, the structure of the UK property industry is, almost alone in the world, designed to suit the investor rather than the occupier. UK tenants' leases are far more onerous than most of their counterparts overseas. In some respects, a tenant's lot is particularly difficult at present. The present slump is scuppering the best-laid plans for relocation, sub-letting and the disposal of empty property. But in other respects, the property glut has turned the tables on landlords, who now have to place more importance than ever on attracting an occupier. This is creating unprecedented opportunities. Measures that should be considered include: Tougher negotiations on new leases. Tandy, the retail chain, is refusing to sign any leases without a five-year break clause. Boots has just won a court case over its refusal to sign an upwards-only rent review. Sale and leasebacks, which allow a company to unlock the capital tied up in a building. This is likely to have increasing appeal to property-rich companies, such as hotel chains and retailers, which want to strengthen balance sheets. Improved management information. At least 20 per cent of the top 100 companies do not even known the basics such as location, size and tenure of each property they occupy, according to DTC. Only a third of large companies have a comprehensive management information system. Separating the role of landlord and occupier within a company. Charging an occupier the true costs of its premises can have important implications for its profitability. When, for instance, Kingfisher, the retail group, introduced this arm's-length approach between shops and property investment in the early 1980s, it exposed the poor returns of a phalanx of stores which were then closed. Extracting value from properties. Most portfolios offer opportunities to buy in unfavourable leases, to realise development potential, to enhance values by getting planning permission or release 'marriage' value by combining freehold and leasehold in one ownership. Even in the the trough of the property recession, there is scope for companies to think ahead. If property is to be more than a necessary evil, companies need to minimise costs and identify value.</p>

			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Brave new world of electronics: Technology is changing at a rapid pace, but companies are still not sure where the developments are leading Do you long for the day when you can toss out the remote control on your video machine and, when you leave for work in the morning, tell it in plain English to record your favourite afternoon soap opera? Or perhaps you would enjoy flipping up a screen on your CD player, while travelling on the 7:58 train from Sevenoaks, and watching a movie on the way to work. Better still, why not stay at home and work via a machine that fits in the palm of your hand, sending and receiving sound, text and crystal clear pictures by means of an inbuilt digital communicator? When work is done, you could relax by donning the video goggles, earphones and electronic sensors, and enjoying a computer-generated fantasy of your choice. The technology for these devices, and many more, is developing at startling speed. Electronic gadgets that may still pass for implausible science fiction are suddenly looking like realistic, if expensive and risky, business propositions for high-technology companies. Indeed, technology is advancing so rapidly that the business strategy for consumer electronics companies is shifting fundamentally. These companies, in Japan and elsewhere, have been working for years to develop technology to improve the performance of products we know and love, from televisions to stereos. Now they are faced with a simultaneous explosion of different technologies that have created almost limitless possibilities for the design of electronic goods. The question is: what are they going to do with them? The pace of change, including the rapid advance of digital processing, has torn down the barriers between separate categories of goods, such as televisions, telephones, stereos and computers, and is leading to new types of products - many in the broad category of multi-media devices that perform multiple functions. It has also prompted a budding strategic alliance between Sony, the Japanese consumer electronics company, and Apple Computer, the US personal computer maker, two of the most innovative companies in their respective fields. Companies' success in developing new products will determine whether they are able to maintain the rapid growth that has characterised the electronics industry for several decades. The growth products of the 1980s, such as video recorders, personal computers, or Walkman-type cassette players, are approaching market saturation and new products are needed to sustain the momentum. The electronics companies will also be keen to get a decent return from their research spending, which for Matsushita and Sony last year came to about 10 per cent of sales. Hints of the brave new world in consumer electronics can be seen in products coming to market now: Video displays: Sharp, the Osaka-based electronics company, took the lead in offering compact and portable video displays last year when it offered for sale an 8.6-inch colour television that hangs flat on a wall. The television uses liquid crystal display (LCD) technology that eliminates the need for the traditional bulky, heavy picture tube. Improvements in manufacturing technology in the coming years should steadily reduce the price below the current Y550,000 (Pounds 2,350), and allow for larger flat-screen TVs that can be moved about easily and consume little electricity. Already, in Japan, a 5.6-inch colour LCD television that should keep the kids quiet in the back seat of the car is available for about Pounds 400. For big screens, more popular in Japan and the US than Europe, the quality has improved steadily, both for large picture tubes and projection televisions, in which the image is projected on to a flat screen bigger than the 40-inch technical limit for glass tubes. The gradual increase in picture quality for traditional broadcast standards will continue as digital processing and other small improvements are introduced. High-quality TV projection on to these large screens, up to 100 inches and more, will require high-definition television (HDTV). Otherwise the flaws in older broadcast standards are simply magnified. HDTV is only available in Japan today, but should become available in Europe by the middle of the decade. Digital music: digital music on compact disc has already virtually put traditional long-playing records out of business. The technology is now being developed further: this year Sony is launching its MiniDisc, a compact disc (CD) player that, after a few years of miniaturisation, should be little bigger than a small matchbox. Meanwhile, Philips and Matsushita are launching the Digital Compact Cassette (DCC), which will play a digital tape about the same size as traditional (analog) cassette tapes. Both the MiniDisc and DCC achieve miniaturisation by using new technology to compress digital data, although sound quality is compromised to some extent compared with a full-sized CD. Sony's MiniDisc, which can record as well as play music, will be smaller, giving it the edge on portability, and will contain circuits to prevent it skipping tracks when knocked about. This is a problem with portable CD players on the market today. DCC machines have the advantage of being able to play old-style analog cassettes, as well as play and record digital tapes. But they will never be smaller than the most minute Walkman-type tape players, and it remains to be seen whether digital tape audio quality will be significantly better than for analog tapes, which have seen quality steadily improve. Compact discs: the little CD read by a laser currently used for music is becoming an ever more capable performer. The digital information that it stores can be used for other functions, from text to moving colour images. Within a few years, most personal computers may come with a CD drive. Sony has tapped just a small part of the CD's potential with its Data Discman, which will be available in the UK from this spring and which can display reference books stored on a small 8cm CD. The latest model displays simple illustrations and produces sound - actually pronouncing the dictionary entries. Philips and Sony have jointly developed the compact disc interactive format (CD-I), a full-sized CD that can display moving pictures and text, and play music. It could, for example, display the score of an opera while playing it. Sony is planning to use the CD-I to publish comic books in Japan, where they are extremely popular. The storage capacity of CDs is also being improved. Pioneer Electronic and Sony are both working on technologies to increase capacity by between four and 20 times. If a CD could store an entire feature film, it could undermine the less portable and less flexible videotape business. Yet the latest products using CDs, such as the CD-I, are taking electronics companies into unknown territory because they go far beyond the scope of traditional forms of entertainment. While no one could predict with certainty that video recorders would be so successful, there was at least a body of popular films and television material that could be used on the machines. Similarly, an improved stereo system, like the compact disc player launched in 1982, had an obvious appeal to music lovers and a ready library of 'software' - ie, popular music - to be recorded on CD. It is far less obvious what to do with the CD-I. So far there is little software in the form of prepared compact discs to go with the new machines. This has become a general problem: advanced technology has vastly broadened the scope for what machines can potentially do, but the software has lagged far behind. Mr Nobuyuki Idei, a Sony director, explains the dilemma: 'In the past the hardware and software were separate businesses. The software was (freely available). Now we cannot think about hardware without software.' Electronics companies are aware of the need to keep the supply of 'software' growing, by gaining, for example, access to film libraries. Two years ago Sony paid Dollars 3.4bn (Pounds 1.86bn) for Columbia Pictures and, in 1988, Dollars 2bn for CBS Records, while last December Matsushita made a Dollars 6.1bn (Pounds 3.35bn) acquisition of MCA, the US entertainment group that includes Universal Studios. At least two new concepts under development are moving electronics companies on to uncertain ground: Virtual reality: the interactive computer simulation of visual, audio and tactile reality, triggered by body movements detected by electronic sensors, is still primitive. Computers can generate the visual and auditory sensation of pushing a ball around in space in response to finger movements and will eventually be able to simulate the sights and sounds of much more complex environments - everything from tropical islands to space machines. Virtual reality machines put the participants into these environments, and allow them to manipulate them. An orchestra may respond to the beat of a simulated baton, or the world blow up at the touch of an imagined button. Sony has set a team of scientists to work on the concept in the full knowledge that developing a successful mass market for virtual reality machines is beyond the company's traditional strengths in making the hardware. Mr Idei says: 'For virtual reality we have to depend entirely on new artists. We need a lot of people like Steven Spielberg.' Multi-media: this is the buzzword for a new generation of computers, still at the drawing board stage, with sophisticated video and audio capabilities. They could be, for example, small interactive machines that play CD-quality music, receive and display moving and still pictures, send and receive data, and perform computing functions. They could have applications in education, but the consumer market potential is uncertain. 'The possibilities for multi-media are very big,' says Mr Masaharu Noyori, head of technology planning at Matsushita Electric Industrial. Yet, who needs it? In spite of the vast technological possibilities, Mr Noyori admits that the biggest problem facing Matsushita is working out what people want. The dangers of spending millions on developing machines that flop in the market are huge. Market research is not necessarily a help because consumers themselves are unlikely to know what they want until machines hit store shelves. Sony is teaming up with Apple Computer and Motorola to develop multi-media products. The details of their co-operation have not been announced, but Sony's expertise in audio-visual technology will be combined with Apple's experience in personal computing and Motorola's capabilities in digital cellular phone technology. Mr Idei says: 'This is the merger of the computer and audio-visual industries. It will take 10 years, but it will come.' This is brave talk. From a technical standpoint, less and less separates the many branches of the consumer electronics family. Yet creative genius, as much as engineering and manufacturing prowess, will be required to turn all this technology into products that succeed. The necessity of tapping into the artistically 'creative' side of the business has been recognised not only by Sony and Matsushita, but also by Pioneer, Toshiba and JVC, all of which have formed close links with American entertainment companies. Such has been the pace of their technological innovation of late that Japanese companies are having to make big new efforts to broaden their horizons, in order to exploit ideas developing elsewhere.</p>

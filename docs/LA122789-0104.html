			<p><P> December 27, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEW EXCEL NEEDS MORE IMPROVEMENTS  </P> <P> Not a moment too soon, Hyundai has introduced a new, improved Excel. It is just  a bit longer, more powerful and a little more expensive than last year's model.  </P> <P> It is better basic transportation, but still not quite equal to the Japanese  competition. Then again, neither is its window sticker.  </P> <P> The Excel was the first South Korean car to be sold in the United States when  it was introduced in 1986. Few Americans had heard of its manufacturer and few  could pronounce the company's name correctly (it rhymes with Sunday). The car  caught on, though, and more than 800,000 Excels have been sold.  </P> <P> But the Excel's prices, which once began at just under $5,000, have crept  upward to a base price $7,294 (including destination charge) because of  currency exchange rates and inflation. Meanwhile, the demand for small cars has  declined.  </P> <P> The result was predictable: Hyundai's U.S. sales have fallen by almost 30% so  far this year below last year's level. Hyundai is hoping that the 1990 Excel  and the larger Sonata introduced earlier will change that.  </P> <P> The new Excel has smoother lines that reduce its wind resistance and make it  more contemporary. But perhaps the most important change is a 20% increase in  horsepower, attributable mostly to electronic fuel injection. With a 1.5-liter,  four-cylinder engine producing a claimed 81 horsepower, the Excel still won't  outrun a Corvette, but it is better able now to keep up with the pack.  </P> <P> The five-speed manual transmission, standard in certain Excels, is new and  shifts easily. The clutch was easy to get used to, though our time with the  Excel was cut short when, without warning, the clutch began slipping badly.  Last we heard, the car was being trucked to the West Coast where Hyundai  technicians will try to diagnose the problem.  </P> <P> For such unhappy times, every Hyundai comes with free membership for one year  in the Cross Country Auto Club.  </P> <P> A four-speed electronically controlled transmission, available optionally, also  is new.  </P> <P> The Excel is available as a two-door hatchback, four-door hatchback and  four-door sedan. It comes with four levels of standard equipment and trim:  plain, GS, GL and GLS. Only the four-door sedan can be ordered in GLS version,  which begins at $8,774, including destination charge.  </P> <P> Most Hyundai controls are similar to those found in Japanese economy cars. The  Excel is, in fact, derived from the Mirage made by Mitsubishi, which owns 15%  of Hyundai.  </P> <P> Hyundai claims better handling for the new Excel, thanks to front suspension  revisions. But, even with those changes and with rack-and-pinion steering and  front and rear stabilizer bars, the Excel still cannot be considered a sport  sedan. That is one reason we don't think it is equal to Japanese entries like  the Honda Civic.  </P> <P> The other reason is reliability. Consumers Union, publisher of Consumer Reports  magazine, says its surveys show 1988 Excels "average" in their frequency of  repair. That's an improvement over "much worse than average" for 1987 models,  but most Japanese models do better.  </P></p>

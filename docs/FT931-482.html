			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Council tax valuation changes SOME 200,000 changes to draft valuations for the council tax are expected to have been made even before the starting date for appeals, Mr Anthony Nelson, the Treasury economic secretary, said yesterday. He said that the changes resulted from local councils notifying the listing officers of alterations and from public inquiries. The formal date for appealing against a valuation, which will affect how much local tax a household will pay, is 1 April when the new tax comes into effect. Ministers have made provision for about 1m appeals.</p>

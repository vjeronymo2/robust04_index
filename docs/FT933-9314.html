			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / Government Bonds: Bundesbank's stance disappoints Europe THE BUNDESBANK'S repo announcement yesterday provided the main focus of attention for the European government bond markets, as dealers and investors waited for signs that the German central bank would allow an easing. In the event, the Bundesbank left its 14-day repo rate at 6.80 per cent, unchanged on the previous week and only 5 basis points above the Bundesbank's discount rate which usually acts as the floor for money market rates. While expectations of a cut had not been very strong before the repo, there was clearly disappointment that the Bundesbank failed to ease. 'The Bundesbank is keeping its cards close to its chest, and this move has dampened down the (discount) rate cut speculation,' said one dealer. The Liffe bund futures contract, which opened at 97.10, slipped back to a low of 97.03 on the repo news but later moved up to reach a high of 97.36 in average volume. Mr Philip Tyson, European economist at Yamaichi International, pointed out that the Bundesbank's tough stance on the interest rate front 'bodes well for the inflation outlook and helps the long end of the market'. ALTHOUGH the short end of the bond market slipped slightly yesterday, the rally in longer-dated US Treasury prices showed no signs of abating as yields fell further into record low territory. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  7/32 at 108 27/32 , yielding 6.449 per cent, another new all-time low. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was down  1/16 at 100 9/32 , to yield 4.083 per cent. Although trading throughout the day was relatively subdued, prices sustained their upward momentum at the long end of the market. Dealers said there was nothing particularly new behind the long end's advance, which was put down to the follow-through from overnight buying in Japan, and to pre-auction jockeying. In the afternoon, the Treasury auctioned Dollars 16.5bn in three-year notes, the first part of its latest refunding round. The sale went relatively well, although retail interest was slightly disappointing. The remaining two tranches of the refunding will be auctioned today and tomorrow. THE Banque de France left its overnight rate unchanged at 9.75 per cent, disappointing those who believe the rate could comfortably be lowered at any time. Long-dated government bonds ended firmer on the day, and the Matif September bond futures contract ended floor trading at 122.28, up 0.36. MEDIUM and long-dated UK government bonds gained over a quarter of a point as foreign investors continued to buy the gilt market, inspired by the favourable inflation outlook. In the futures market, the September gilt futures contract broke through the 112 level to end at 112.01, up from 111.15 at the previous day's close. The market is waiting for the release tomorrow of July unemployment figures and June average earnings and industrial production data. THE JAPANESE government bond market ended firmer, supported by the strength of the yen against the dollar and hopes that the Bank of Japan will ease monetary policy in the next few months. The September futures contract opened at 111.67 and reached a high of 111.78 before ending at 111.70.</p>

			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / BBC makes offer on copyright fees ahead of tribunal ruling THE BBC has made publishers a new offer on copyright payments several weeks before the Copyright Tribunal is due to rule on the issue. The move by BBC Enterprises came last month following the tribunal hearing which opened on November 12 and ended on December 20. A decision is not expected before the end of this month. Copyright fees became controversial last year after deregulation of the television listings market. The government decided to end what Mr Douglas Hurd, then home secretary, called the 'dotty duopoly' of Radio Times and TV Times. All programme listings had henceforth to be provided to publishers in return for a copyright fee. The Newspaper Publishers' Association, which represents national newspapers; the Newspaper Society, representing regional newspapers; Time Out, the London listings magazine; Hello, the national magazine; and the Surrey Advertiser group, representing the interests of weekly newspapers, complained to the tribunal that the fees were too high. Mr Tony Elliott, publisher of Time Out, and a long-time opponent of the listings duopoly said yesterday he was 'amazed' that BBC Enterprises, publisher of Radio Times, should have offered a deal before the tribunal decision was known. Mr Elliott said he believed the 'without-prejudice' offer went first to the Newspaper Society and was later sent to the other parties. The offer is believed to involved considerable reductions in the present rate card. Mr John Mellon, chairman of IPC Magazines, publisher of TV Times and What's on TV, yesterday also expressed surprise that the BBC should have made an offer when it did. IPC, which owns copyright in ITV programmes until the end of this year, said that it will await the tribunal's verdict and does not intend to make any offers to publishers. It is believed that Newspaper Society lawyers have been in contact with BBC lawyers since the without prejudice offer was received but it is not clear if there is any chance of an agreement. The BBC action is being interpreted by publishing groups as a sign that the corporation may be taking a pessimistic view of the outcome of the Copyright Tribunal hearings.</p>

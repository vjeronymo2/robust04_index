			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / Consumer confidence in US slips AMERICAN consumer confidence this month fell to its lowest level since March, according to the latest survey by the Conference Board, the business research organisation, writes Jurek Martin in Washington. Its widely watched index stood at 58.0 in August, down from a revised 61.2 in July. The base of 100 reflects 1985 levels of consumer confidence. The director of research said the drop was moderate, but the continued sag in consumer spirits was 'disconcerting'. Recent surveys have suggested that business confidence is far higher than that of consumers. The Conference Board's business confidence index is at its highest level since 1984, while the Dun and Bradstreet analysis of business expectations is now at its highest level in three years. With the election less than 10 weeks away, the lack of consumer optimism concerns the Bush re-election campaign.</p>

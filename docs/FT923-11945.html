			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / UK Company News: St Modwen bucks trend with rise to Pounds 1.04m ST MODWEN Properties, the Birmingham-based investment and development company, yesterday defied the general sector trend by announcing a marginal increase in interim profits. For the six months to May 31 profits rose from Pounds 1.02m to Pounds 1.04m at the pre-tax level. Turnover was Pounds 11.4m, against Pounds 33.4m last time when sales were inflated by one unusually large property sale. Earnings per share were unchanged at 0.6p. The company is now receiving rental income in excess of interest payments and, according to Mr Stan Clarke, chairman, by the end of this financial year rental income will cover both interest charges and management costs. Gross rental income during the first half was Pounds 3.3m, but interest charges were Pounds 2.5m (Pounds 3.2m). The company does not capitalise its interest charges. Gearing was fractionally reduced to 85 per cent but is expected to show a modest rise by the year-end. Mr Clarke, through a personal company, is injecting Pounds 1.56m into Uttoxeter Leisure &amp; Development, 81 per cent controlled by St Modwen and owner of the Uttoxeter racecourse. The injection, in exchange for shares, will have the effect of eliminating the racecourse company's debts to St Modwen and provide funds for course improvement.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] At 0300 this morning in Corsica, there were two  simultaneous explosions 100 km apart. A grenade exploded in  front of a police station at Pietrodicerce, and a powerful bomb  went off outside the Solenzara military base near Bastia. This  is the first time the bombers manage to get within the perimeter  fence, which is surrounded by barbed wire and watchtowers.  Christophe Lurie reports from Bastia:    [Lurie] The bomb was placed within the perimeter of the  Solenzara military base, an hour's drive from Bastia. The  explosion, which took place at 0300 this morning, caused  significant damage to the office of the commander of the air  base. Colonel Jackie Cognet had already been the target of a  previous attack. On Friday [15 April] night, a grenade was  thrown at his home from a vehicle, but did not caused any  damage. These two attacks could be linked to tomorrow's visit to  Corsica by Defense Minister Francois Leotard, who will be in  Ajaccio to present the results achieved over the past year by  the Balladur Government.</p>

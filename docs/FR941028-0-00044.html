			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Industry commenters objected that the proposed definition of ``violation notice'' contained in the regulation was too broad. They argued that the proposed definition, insofar as it applies to a ``Federal violation notice'' should be explicitly limited to violations of environmental laws. Further, they asserted that the definition inappropriately included written communications and demand letters as ``violations.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM disagrees with the commenters' concern over the need for an explicit limitation for violations of environmental laws in the definition of a ``Federal violation notice.'' Commenters conceded that such a limitation is already contained in the proposed definition of ``violation notice.'' The definition of a Federal violation notice is modified by any limitations contained in the definition of a violation notice. Accordingly, there is no need for an explicit additional limitation to address commenters' concerns. It is already clear that it is limited to violations of environmental laws. Thus, OSM has adopted the proposed definition of ``Federal violation notice'' as a final definition without modification. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, commenters asserted that the proposed rule inappropriately expanded the definition of violation notice to include various written communications and demand letters. They asserted that a demand letter could somehow preclude a permit applicant from pursuing a good faith appeal and that a person's ability to challenge the debt would depend on whether the agency attempted to collect the debt. In substance, commenters took exception to the prospect of a demand letter being the basis for a permit denial when the demand letter contains notice of a delinquent civil penalty and the applicable statute of limitations has expired precluding further action to collect the debt. They asserted that the proposed rule impermissibly expands the types of violations for which a person could be subject to permit block without affording the person a right of timely challenge. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Again, OSM disagrees with commenters' analysis. First, it must be emphasized that the type of document is less significant than the violation of which it provides notice. The document is merely a vehicle for communicating notice of the substantive violation. The documents listed in the proposed definition merely recount the possible types of documents providing notice and do not substantively expand the universe of violations which would be the basis for permit denial under section 510(c) of the Act and the provisions of 30 CFR 773.15(b). The substantive violation, rather than the type of document, forms the basis for a permit denial under the provisions of section 510(c) of the Act and 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1). Pursuant to those provisions, a regulatory authority is required to refuse permit issuance where available information indicates that any surface coal mining operation owned or controlled by an applicant is currently in violation of the Act or other indicated laws. Delinquent fees or penalties which have ripened to the level for which a demand letter is indicated constitute available information for which an applicant will be held accountable and which a regulatory authority must take into account in any permit decision. Contrary to commenters' assertions, the filing of a suit to collect delinquent reclamation fees or civil penalties is not a condition precedent to such debts being valid violations or a condition precedent to such debts being considered the bases for permit denial. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to the commenters' concerns about rights of challenge incident to demand letters, OSM believes that current quality control procedures will prevent the entry of unripe violations into the system. Furthermore, with this final rule and with OHA's rule which is being contemporaneously published, OSM and OHA have acted to provide a means for applicants to obtain temporary relief from permit blocks where they are likely to prevail on the merits. Thus, if a violation has not actually ripened into the basis for a permit block, temporary relief could be sought. The discussion of these provisions of the final rule are contained at the discussion of 30 CFR 773.25 below in this preamble. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Industry commenters also objected to the prospect that a demand letter or other notice could contain notice of a delinquent civil penalty the collection of which is barred by the applicable statute of limitations. In substance, they argued that such a notice should not be the basis for a permit denial. OSM disagrees. In 1988, OSM addressed similar concerns expressed by commenters with respect to the ownership and control rules. OSM stated, in relevant part, as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> Effect of Statute of Limitations on Collection Actions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> A commenter asserted that permit blocking cannot occur for any civil penalty which has not been reduced to judgment within the applicable statute of limitations in 28 U.S.C. 2462 (barring an action, suit or proceeding for enforcement of any civil fine, penalty unless commenced within five years). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

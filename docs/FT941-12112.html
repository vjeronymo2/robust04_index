			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / The BMW/Rover Deal: Honda's European strategy wrecked - Honda ditched Honda's long-term European strategy yesterday lay in tatters. The group's bruised management admitted its chances of being able to develop further its 15-year relationship with Rover appeared remote. But while Mr Shojiro Miyake, president of Honda Motor Europe, said yesterday that it was 'too early' to make decisions about future strategy - requiring also talks with BMW - commercial realities make it highly unlikely that it would seek to pull the plug on the ongoing collaborative projects with Rover. Most important of this is a replacement for the current Honda Concerto and Rover 200/400 models, expected in 1995. Even at this relatively late stage, Honda indicated yesterday that it could 'go it alone' if necessary and build its version at Swindon without supplies from Rover, which will build its version separately at Longbridge. But at a time when Honda itself is under fierce financial pressures, it would make no commercial sense for it to forego the economies of scale arising from Rover's supply of body panels for it and the Honda Accord also being built at Swindon. The belief of Mr George Simpson, Rover chairman - shortly to depart to become chief executive of Lucas Industries - is that collaboration will be wound down gradually, a process likely to take up to 10 years. All sides accept that a period of tension is now an inevitability. But BMW yesterday was giving every sign that, for its part, it had no wish to change any of the projects currently under way. The speed at which Honda's strategy unravelled left managers at its headquarters in Tokyo's fashionable Aoyama district clearly bewildered and resentful. Mr Kiyoshi Ikemi, adviser to Honda's president, Mr Nobuhiko Kawamoto, explained: 'We did not want to make Rover Japanese. We wanted to increase Rover's Roverness. We wanted it to be more British - that was the way the collaboration would work best.' Although Honda management yesterday did not talk about betrayal, the company dryly commented that successful partnerships should be based on trust as well as synergy. 'Now our partner has been acquired by a competitor we must start to reassess our entire operations in Europe,' said Mr Ikemi. 'Mr Kawamoto has made it quite clear that he has no intention of collaborating with BMW in the UK. We did not want to collaborate with Rover through BMW. Such a collaboration was not called for - we had nothing to gain from it,' he said. Although nothing had been decided, it would be wrong to jump to the conclusion that Honda would break its existing agreements with Rover, said Mr Ikemi. The collapse of Honda's European alliance could not have come at a worse time for the company. Management attention was already fully focused on problems in the domestic and US markets. Whatever European strategy Honda adopts, it will take far more time to draw up than it took for the previous one to unravel.</p>

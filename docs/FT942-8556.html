			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / US talks map out a new Bosnian future Western and Russian negotiators convened in Washington yesterday to map out, in the literal sense, a new partition of Bosnia which they will press the warring parties to accept. Yet with sanctions daily waning in effectiveness, and mounting domestic controversy over Bosnia in the US, France and Russia, the window of opportunity created by the new diplomatic initiative is a small one. The contact group on Yugoslavia - made up of the US, Russia, Britain, France and Germany - is fine-tuning a peace plan with the help of the US government's sophisticated map-making equipment which can reproduce any terrain. They want the parties, who have not met since February, to convene next week, possibly in France. Since Serbs, Moslems, and Croats all have a stake in appearing constructive, these talks stand a fair chance of taking place, diplomats say. Yet a marked improvement in the Serbian economy, and the mounting evidence of substantial arms deliveries to the Moslem leadership in Bosnia, suggest that the big powers may be running short of diplomatic leverage. Diplomats in Belgrade say that unless a phased lifting of sanctions against Yugoslavia begins soon, the world community could be made to look ridiculous. There are more cars on the streets of Belgrade, real wages have risen and fears of hyperinflation have receded. In Bosnia, a senior military official last week confirmed that the government had received airlifts of weapons from Iran. The Moslem-Croat truce has also made it easier to pick up arms deliveries at Croat ports and airfields. These developments are making almost irrelevant the furious debates in Washington - where a powerful lobby wants to lift the arms embargo - and in Moscow, where parliament wants an end to sanctions against the Serbs. Rows in Washington and Moscow have served, however, to undermine the efforts of the contact group to knock heads together. Moslem and Serb hardliners can now reject the group's new proposals in the confidence that their stance will find backers in Washington and Moscow respectively. Moslems who favour fighting on will also take heart from events in France, where the Mr Bernard-Henri Levy, the philosopher, has mounted a campaign for an unequivocal support for the Bosnian government. France said yesterday that a 'moment of decision' for its own presence on Bosnia might come on June 13, when foreign ministers from the leading powers review progress. Paris has already threatened to withdraw 2,500 of its 6,800 soldiers if there were no movement. In London the Foreign Office said an 'eight-week' deadline set by a UK minister this week referred to the probable lifetime of the new diplomatic initiative. A failure of the current drive would not automatically lead to a troop pull-out, but it would bring such a step closer.</p>

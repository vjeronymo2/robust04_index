			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: Pibs that bear watching - Bonds Gilts and sterling bonds have been among the worse performers in the first quarter of this year. But the capital value matters only when you sell your investment and, with most bonds, you have the comfort of a fixed repayment date, and value, for which to hold on. Permanent interest-bearing shares (Pibs) offer only one, albeit enhanced, virtue - a fixed income, since there is no repayment date. Now, First National and the Cheshire Building Society have issued floating rate Pibs. Since the interest rate is changed every six months and the issuer never repays the capital, such an investment would appear not to offer any of the benefits enjoyed by holders of other bonds. But with concern growing over the direction of interest rates, a bond from which the income will rise in line with these is attractive, especially if the capital does not fluctuate greatly. We must, however, put this in context. The Cheshire (ranked 22nd-largest society) issue will, every six months, re-fix the income it pays by adding 2.4 percentage points to the six-monthly rate paid by Libor - the London Interbank Offered Rate, which is the rate of interest in the short-term wholesale market. What is more, the Cheshire promises to do this forever. At present, the six-monthly Libor rate plus 2.4 percentage points equates to an interest rate of a little under 8 per cent. But it is easy to forget that Pibs are the lowest quality share issued by the societies and rank among the last creditors in liquidation. With conventional Pibs, the high fixed yield offers some compensation for this risk. But the return from floating Pibs should be compared with deposits. Some deposit accounts from larger societies offer full repayment of capital and no dealing charges as well as rates close to those of floating Pibs. Thus, investors must question the merits of these Pibs. Michael Dyson is a director of BZW Capital Markets. This is a market-maker and cannot deal direct with private clients.

			<p><P> December 15, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANC LEADER URGES SHIFT IN STAND ON SANCTIONS  </P> <P> African National Congress President Oliver R. Tambo, opening a historic  nationwide ANC conference Friday, urged his black liberation movement to  consider for the first time softening its stand on sanctions against South  Africa.  </P> <P> "It is no longer enough for us to repeat the tired slogans," said Tambo, 73,  delivering the first speech since his return Thursday from 30 years in exile.  "We should . . . carefully re-evaluate the advisability of insisting on the  retention of sanctions, given the new developments in the country and abroad."  </P> <P> Tambo's recommendation signaled an important change in strategy for the ANC,  which until now has publicly insisted that sanctions be maintained until a new  constitution has been adopted or, at the least, "profound and irreversible"  change has occurred.  </P> <P> Many ANC leaders have begun to worry that, no matter what the ANC says, the  United States and other foreign countries may soon ease or remove sanctions  against Pretoria.  </P> <P> World leaders, including President Bush, have said they want to reward  President Frederik W. de Klerk for his reform initiatives and encourage him to  continue to dismantle apartheid and begin negotiations with black leaders.  </P> <P> As Tambo spoke Friday, a summit of European Community leaders in Rome was  considering a proposal to lift its ban on new investments in South Africa. The  ban is a voluntary part of the EC's 1986 sanctions package, which prohibits  importing South African gold coins, iron and steel. Britain and Italy already  have lifted their bans on South African investments.  </P> <P> The likelihood of a modification of sanctions by the EC in coming weeks, and  the possibility that the Bush Administration will soon determine that De Klerk  has met most of the conditions for easing U.S. sanctions, has forced the ANC to  reconsider its position.  </P> <P> ANC Deputy President Nelson Mandela has written European Community leaders,  urging them to hold off on removing sanctions at least until February, when De  Klerk is expected to announce plans to remove laws segregating neighborhoods  and restricting black ownership of land.  </P> <P> But a confidential discussion document being formally circulated at the ANC's  three-day conference says that if the ANC remains rigid on sanctions and they  begin to erode anyway, the movement will "suffer a major defeat."  </P> <P> "Then the perception will be created that the government has scored a major  victory over the ANC, having succeeded in persuading the world to lift  sanctions," the document adds.  </P> <P> The document, which will be debated at the conference, recommends that the ANC  take control of the sanctions debate by drawing up a step-by-step sanctions  modification program linked to government reforms.  </P> <P> The ANC's concern, according to Tambo, is that "at no stage should we ever  allow the strategic initiative to shift to the other side."  </P> <P> ANC-inspired sanctions against South Africa have isolated the country  diplomatically, economically and culturally. Among the stiffest sanctions are  those contained in the U.S. Anti-Apartheid Act, which restricts American  investment and the purchase of South African products.  </P> <P> While economic sanctions have eaten into South Africans' pocketbooks, an array  of international cultural, educational and sports boycotts have had a strong  psychological impact.  </P> <P> Pretoria has long fought sanctions, arguing that those policies hurt the black  majority more than the white minority by creating unemployment and making the  government too poor to raise the standard of living of blacks.  </P> <P> But government opponents say that without the sanctions campaign, the  government would have taken even longer to begin dismantling apartheid and come  to the negotiating table. And lifting the pressure of sanctions from the  government now, some in the ANC argue, would slow the pace of reform.  </P> <P> The sanctions discussion document, entitled "Managing the Period of  Transition," suggests that the ANC consider loosening the cultural, educational  and sports boycotts. It also recommends that the ANC encourage foreign  investments in programs that will directly improve the living conditions of the  nation's 28 million blacks, beset by high unemployment and severe housing  shortages.  </P> <P> However, the document recommends that the oil and arms embargo, as well as  sanctions against development loans, remain in place as long as the white  minority controls the government.  </P> <P> The future of sanctions is one of the primary topics up for discussion among  the 1,600 delegates to the conference, which ends Sunday. Others include the  escalating black factional fighting in Johannesburg-area townships, the ANC's  negotiations strategy and the status of the recently suspended armed struggle.  </P> <P> Delegates also are expected to raise questions about the operations of the ANC,  which has had difficulty making the transition from a revolutionary movement to  a legal, democratic political organization.  </P> <P> Tambo acknowledged the criticism of ANC leaders indirectly on Friday, telling  the conference that the ANC must "root ourselves amongst the people . . . and,  jointly with them, find ways to advance our cause. Conditions of illegality,  which in the past imposed some limitations on our adherence to principles of  democracy, no longer prevail."  </P> <P> The ANC president said that protest marches and other forms of mass action may  soon replace the armed struggle and sanctions as the predominant form of  liberation struggle. And he urged the ANC to organize "all South Africans,  black and white, . . . into a mighty vehicle of liberation."  </P> <P> Both Tambo and Mandela expressed concern about the level of violence, which has  soared since the ANC and other anti-apartheid groups were legalized in  February.  </P> <P> So far this year, 3,460 people, most of them black, have died in political  violence in South Africa -- more than have died in 11 years of conflict in  Northern Ireland, according to the South African Institute of Race Relations.  Since July, 1,020 people have died in factional fighting in Johannesburg-area  townships.  </P> <P> "The massacres in the townships and elsewhere are a painful reminder that  apartheid is still firmly in place," Tambo said. "Accordingly, the struggle  against apartheid should be intensified on all fronts."  </P> <P> Mandela, in his keynote speech to the conference, said most of the black  factional fighting was "neither the outcome of political rivalry nor the  expression of political intolerance among the oppressed." Instead, he said, it  was part of "an orchestrated campaign of counterrevolutionary violence" to  destroy confidence in the ANC and its leadership."  </P></p>

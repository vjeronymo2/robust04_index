			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Call for separate sale of generating business Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity industry regulator, is calling on the regional electricity companies to sell the National Grid's generating business separately at its flotation, planned for next year. The Grid's generation business - pump storage facilities - consists of about 2,000MW of plant in Wales which has typically supplied about 0.5 per cent of the total output in England and Wales. Analysts put its value at between Pounds 300m and Pounds 500m. Prof Littlechild, speaking to the Institute of Economic Affairs, also urged the regional electricity companies to sell their entire stakes in the Grid, rather than keep some shares for disposal later. He also said that there 'would be merit' in considering greater separation of the regional companies' distribution networks from their other activities. He said: 'A clearer separation between monopoly networks and potentially competitive activities is more conducive to effective competition and the protection of customers.' While Prof Littlechild is not able to force the regional companies to comply with his wishes, his views will influence both industry executives and the government, which has a golden share in the Grid. He said continued ownership of the Grid by the regional companies, acceptable as a transitional measure since privatisation in 1990, seemed increasingly inappropriate. 'But it is important for the development of competition that transmission be clearly independent of interests in generation or supply.' Prof Littlechild has also backed the idea that some of the proceeds of the sale should be given to consumers. The Grid had a book value of about Pounds 1.2bn when the regional companies were privatised but is now thought to be worth more than Pounds 4bn.</p>

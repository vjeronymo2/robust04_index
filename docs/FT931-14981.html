			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Smith persistent over Lamont cash MR JOHN SMITH, the Labour leader, infuriated ministers and Tory backbenchers in the Commons yesterday by persistently challenging the use of nearly Pounds 5,000 of taxpayers' money to defray part of the legal expenses incurred by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, to evict a tenant from his private home. The Labour leader was accused of indulging in 'innuendo' by Mr John Major, the prime minister, who insisted that a report by Sir John Bourn, the Comptroller and Auditor General, showed that 'no impropriety occurred'. To Labour cheers, Mr Smith retorted that it was not a matter of innuendo but of public policy. The issue, he maintained, was whether taxpayers' money should finance the legal affairs of a minister in his private capacity. Labour backbenchers heckled and jeered Mr Major when he protested that that Mr Smith had been 'uncharacteristically cheap' in choosing to pursue Mr Lamont. An unrepentant Mr Smith claimed that an attempt had been made to hide from the public the expenditure undertaken on behalf of the chancellor and to prevent it being scrutinised by MPs. Calling on the prime minister to recognise the distinction between public duty and private concern, he said it was clear that the chancellor had instructed solicitors without referring to any of the government's legal advisers. To Labour cheers, Mr Smith demanded: 'Ought not the chancellor to be asked to repay the money now?' The prime minister emphasised that the report by Sir John Bourn had fully exonerated the Treasury on the central questions, namely 'was it right to make the payment, and were any rules breached'. Mr Major said the report confirmed that the chancellor did not ask for assistance and made no criticism of his actions. The prime minister told Mr Smith that if he had 'a shred of self-respect' he would withdraw his remarks. Mr Smith refused to do so, and later made known that he intended to return to the issue in a speech criticising the standards of ministerial conduct. As the fourth day's detailed consideration of the European Communities (Amendment) Bill got under way yesterday, Sir Teddy Taylor, the prominent Tory Euro-sceptic MP for Southend East, called for the new provisions - for a referendum on the Maastricht treaty - to be debated much earlier in the committee stage than is presently intended. Mr Tim Devlin, Tory MP for Stockton South, said that an earlier vote could be facilitated if those calling for a referendum withdrew the large number of other amendments.</p>

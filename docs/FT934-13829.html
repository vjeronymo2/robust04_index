			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / The Lady is for spurning as Tory grandees strike back: Roland Rudd finds former colleagues in harmony as they gang up on TV to respond to charges by 'that woman' AFTER BEING savaged by Baroness Thatcher in her memoirs, the so-called 'wets' and 'grandees' have bitten back, attacking the style and policy of what opponents have described as 'that woman'. Lord Prior says Lady Thatcher was 'dictatorial'. Lord Pym says she was against any suggestion of compromise, 'which meant she had a confrontational style'. Lord Gilmour thinks her judgment was misguided. 'She very seldom said a sentence in itself that was interesting. Rather surprising in all those years.' In a BBC documentary series, Thatcher: The Downing Street Years, starting tonight, victims of the former prime minister describe their intense dislike of her manner. Lady Thatcher's quotation of St Francis of Assisi, beginning 'where there is discord, may we bring harmony', is attacked by Lord Prior, her former employment secretary, as 'complete humbug' and 'hypocritical'. It was 'utter nonsense' for her to have used the quotation as she was the last person to believe in harmony. Lord Pym, her former foreign secretary, says her distain for compromise made it very difficult to have constructive cabinet meetings. 'The idea that somebody else might have a valid point of view which might be a right point of view would never enter her mind at all. Not part of her philosophy.' Lord Prior discloses that Lord Soames, who was leader of the House of the Lords, told him that he would not have treated his gamekeeper as badly as Lady Thatcher treated one of her cabinet. Lord Gilmour recalls how he and Lord Carrington, who were then lord privy seal and foreign secretary respectively, tried to negotiate a Pounds 1bn refund from the EC at the 1979 Dublin summit and ended with only two thirds of that amount. They thought they had done rather well. But when they told her, she became 'incandescent'. Lord Gilmour says: 'Had we been bailiffs coming to take away the furniture I think we would have been more cordially received. She was like a sort of firework, and one could almost hear her almost sizzling.' Lord Carrington believes Lady Thatcher 'did the Foreign Office a great deal of damage'. He has also said: 'All of us had learned over 30 years or so to come to compromises. This is something she hadn't started to learn.' Lady Thatcher recognises that she was unpopular with many colleagues and throughout the country but was determined to stick to her guns. 'My name was mud with some of my colleagues. They always wanted, some of them, an easy way. But I always had enough to get us through.' She says they talked of her as 'that woman'. 'It was that woman which got things done. It never occured to me that I was a woman prime minister.' As for her critics she says: 'They had that biblical weakness - some of them, not all of them - vanity, vanity, all is vanity.' The only former colleague interviewed who remains loyal is Lord Whitelaw, former deputy prime minister, who points out that the Tories won three general elections under Lady Thatcher's leadership.</p>

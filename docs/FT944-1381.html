			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei 225 ends higher for fourth day in succession The Nikkei 225 average gained ground for the fourth consecutive trading day. Friday's rise on Wall Street pushed up futures prices and prompted arbitrage buying, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index finished 107.42 firmer at 19,270.85 after moving between 19,160.03 and 19,336.17. Traders said last week's rise in US equities had relieved investors, who had been worried about an exodus of US funds from global stock markets. While position taking by institutions and dealers eroded some of the morning's gains, late afternoon index-linked buying supported share prices. Volume totalled 250m shares, against 230m. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 5.71 to 1,514.31, while the Nikkei 300 put on 0.93 at 279.97. In spite of the gains in the indices, declines outnumbered advances by 649 to 314, with 206 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged up 0.01 to 1,264.67. Although the Nikkei 225 had bottomed out from last month's nine-month low, some analysts believed that the stock market might face turmoil before the end of the business year in March. 'Given modest economic prospects, an aggressive monetary tightening could dampen expectations of economic growth with negative implications for equities,' wrote Mr Keith Donaldson, a strategist at Salomon Brothers, in a recent report. Trading companies, steels and shipbuilders were actively dealt. Trading house Mitsui was the most active issue of the day, slipping Y4 to Y829. Nippon Steel moved forward Y4 to Y359 and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries finished unchanged at Y728. Sakai Ovex, a synthetic fabrics maker, continued to rise on speculative buying, closing Y25 higher at Y663. Department stores gained ground amid hopes of an increase in sales during the current winter gift giving season. Mitsukoshi, a leading retailer with links to Harrods, moved ahead Y22 to Y1,020 and Tokyu Department Store climbed Y26 to Y696. Konica, the photo film maker, lost Y4 at Y796. It rose to a new high for the year earlier in the day on technical buying, but profit-taking finally depressed the stock after a four-day rising streak. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 96.60 to 20,926.94 in volume of 26.2m shares. Nintendo, the video game maker, dropped Y70 to Y5,430. Individual investors were apprehensive over a possible loss of market share, due to the recent introduction of new electronic game hardware by Sony and Sega. Roundup Wall Street's performance last Friday lifted a number of the region's markets. TAIPEI closed sharply higher following Saturday's gains as institutions increased positions on fundamentally strong industrials. The weighted index strengthened 117.97 or 1.7 per cent to 7,055.30. Turnover amounted to TDollars 118bn. China Steel, the most active issue, rose by its daily 7 per cent limit to TDollars 29.20. Textiles extended recent rises with Hualon jumping TDollars 1.90 or 5.7 per cent to TDollars 35.90. The heavily weighted financial sector also rose to support the market: ICBC surged TDollars 6 or 5.9 per cent to TDollars 110 and First Commercial Bank was up TDollars 3 to TDollars 197. Some brokers attributed the rise in financials, many of which have close government connections, to the ruling Nationalist party's victory in recent local government elections. SEOUL was lower for the fifth consecutive session on persistent worries about tight liquidity, and the composite index shed 7.93 to 1,028.61 in thin trade. Heavy selling of primary blue chips and institutional inactivity put further pressure on the market. Samsung Electronics and Korea Mobile Telecom went limit down, losing Won3,000 and Won10,000 at Won114,900 and Won469,000 respectively. Posco also hit its lower limit, falling Won2,000 to Won66,500. SYDNEY saw light bargain hunting by local investors as the All Ordinaries index gained 3.0 at 1,900.0, off an intraday high of 1,912.9. The futures contract dipped 14 to 1,896. Turnover was ADollars 573m, boosted by options-related trading. Among leading stocks, BHP edged ahead 4 cents to ADollars 19.18. Mining issues were generally firmer on bargain hunting after recent sharp falls: WMC appreciated 19 cents to ADollars 7.39, MIM 7 cents to ADollars 2.19 and RGC 5 cents to ADollars 4.65. HONG KONG finished mildly firmer after retreating from its highs on active profit-taking in the afternoon. The Hang Seng index was finally up 11.95 at 8,178.34, after an early high of 8,326.78 on the back of Friday's rally on Wall Street. Today's US FOMC meeting on interest rates also kept buyers on the sidelines, brokers said. Property issues fell the most, with Cheung Kong losing 20 cents at HKDollars 31.70 and Amoy Properties 15 cents at HKDollars 7.20. The China-controlled container leasing company Florens Group made its debut at a 55.5 cents or 19.3 per cent discount from its issue price, ending at HKDollars 2.325 on its first day of trading. BOMBAY fell prey to a threat by the opposition, right-wing Bharatiya Janata party to launch a campaign to oust ministers named in a sugar import and a securities scandal. The BSE 30-share index retreated 33.59 to 3,910.06. SINGAPORE moved ahead on renewed demand for blue chip issues, mostly by local funds. The Straits Times Industrial index rose 15.47 to 2,185.19, but volume was thin at 61.7m shares. Fraser &amp; Neave added 30 cents at SDollars 15.20 on slightly better than expected full-year figures. Asia Pacific Breweries, a joint venture between F &amp; N and Heineken, rose 13.6 per cent in late-day trading as retail investors chased the stock for its one-for-one scrip issue. APB climbed SDollars 2.10 to SDollars 17.50 but in thin volume. KUALA LUMPUR closed higher in response to Wall Street, but reluctance by investors to accumulate stocks kept volumes low. The composite index firmed 10.65 to 957.25, helped by a 70-cent rise to MDollars 17.30 in Telekom Malaysia. MANILA finished off its intraday peak as investors took profits after the index leapt by 45 points in the first 30 minutes of trade. The composite index closed 14.27 up at 2,723.26. Volume increased to 2.4bn shares worth 2.13bn pesos.</p>

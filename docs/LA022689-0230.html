			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> An officer convicted in the death of a Marine lance corporal who was left in  the Mojave Desert last August was sentenced to four months in the brig and will  be dismissed from the Marine Corps. A jury of eight officers at Camp LeJeune,  N.C., deliberated about two hours before recommending the sentence for 1st Lt.  Allen Lawson. Earlier, the same jury convicted Lawson of dereliction of duty  and an unrelated charge of appearing drunk in public in December. Lawson, 25,  of Flint, Mich., was the only commissioned officer charged in the case; two  sergeants were convicted earlier.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Soviet Update -- Film at 11:45: The Vremya TV news program, a fixture in the  Soviet Union for 21 years with its once-a-day newscast at 9 p.m., now will be  broadcast three times a day with two anchors, reflecting a more Western  approach to TV news. "The format change is because of the increased flow in  information," Ivan Ilyoshin, a senior editor of the Vremya (Time) program, said  Wednesday.  </P> <P> On Monday, Soviet viewers for the first time saw an anchorman and anchorwoman  reading the news under soft lights, sitting behind low desks. A third person  reported sports. Vremya now will have half-hour TV news programs at 12:30, 6:30  and 9 p.m., plus a news summary at 11:45 p.m. DANIEL CERONE  </P></p>

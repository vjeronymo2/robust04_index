			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Survey of Emerging Markets (26): Venturing in search of higher yields - Bond markets Fixed income investors are proving ever more adventurous in their quest for higher yields, turning to the world's more exotic emerging market locations to invest their funds. While the yields on US Treasury bonds, Japanese government debt and European government bonds have declined steadily over the past couple of years, bond issues from some of the emerging economies have provided fixed income investors with an attractive, high-yielding alternative. Many international investors are already familiar and comfortable with the idea of investing in emerging market debt which is denominated in US dollars, yen, or one of the core European currencies. But recently the trend has been for the more adventurous investors to explore the domestic debt route, investing in government - and where possible, corporate - bond markets. 'Lots of people are out looking for opportunities, and an increasing number of emerging market debt funds are looking at these domestic debt markets,' says Ms Elizabeth Morrissey, managing partner of Kleiman International Consultants, which specialises in emerging markets and which publishes data on the emerging bond and money markets*. While emerging market debt funds already invest in Brady bonds and eurobonds, some are turning to the domestic bond markets of emerging economies as well. Of the various domestic debt markets, Mexico has already seen considerable interest: in 1992 and 1993, international investors eagerly invested in Mexican 'cetes' or short-dated paper to obtain double-digit yields. 'North Africa is attracting a lot of international investor interest at the moment - in countries such as Morocco and Egypt you can obtain double-digit yields tax-free, and it's really not that difficult to buy the paper,' says Ms Morrissey. In Ghana, short- and medium-dated paper yields 'over 30 per cent', she adds. Given that the yields on US Treasury bonds reached their lowest levels in nearly 20 years last year, it is easy to see why double-digit yields are such a lure. Other markets which are attracting investor interest include the Peruvian corporate bond market, where the paper is denominated in US dollars. Ms Morrissey says this is seen as an 'evolving' market, given that there have been several new issues, although she maintains it is still easier to invest in Peru via the eurobond market.' The problem with some of these emerging bond markets is the currency risk: as an investor you have to feel confident with the government's overall economic policy and interest rate policy,' says Ms Morrissey. Mr Justin Cormack, an emerging markets fund manager at Guinness Flight, points out that 'many of these domestic bond markets are quite large, but can be difficult to invest in, for example, South Korea'. Guinness Flight recently launched an Asian currency and bond fund, which has attracted about Dollars 11m from investors so far and which invests in the domestic bond markets of Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, South Korea, Hong Kong, and India (which is seen as particularly attractive because of the high yields available), as well as more developed markets in the region such as Australia and New Zealand. Mr Cormack believes there are several good reasons to invest in the region's bond markets. Many of these countries will need to borrow heavily for substantial infrastructure projects. At the same time, some of the domestic stock markets are relatively expensive, while the currencies are cheap and have scope to appreciate, Mr Cormack says. For some international investors these domestic bond markets may still seem rather esoteric. Their route into the emerging markets tends to be through the international bond market where there has been a plentiful supply of new issues, particularly from the Latin American countries. Last year was a bumper year in the eurobond market, with record new issuance of Dollars 412bn, up from Dollars 279bn in 1992, according to figures compiled by IFR Securities Data. Of the Dollars 412bn in new issuance, Dollars 35.9bn - equivalent to 8.7 per cent of the total - was issued by emerging market names, with the bulk of this (Dollars 29.7bn) issued in dollars. The volume of new issues from emerging market borrowers - especially Latin American ones - has surged. Total new issues from the emerging markets has more than doubled, from a total of Dollars 14.4bn in 1992 to Dollars 35.9bn last year, and total issuance from Latin American names has increased from Dollars 9.88bn (106 issues) in 1992 to Dollars 19.2bn (187 issues) in 1993, according to IFR Securities Data. Mexico, Brazil and Argentina remain the most important source of new issues, and as investors have become more familiar with the individual corporate names, the yield spreads (in other words, the yield pick-up over the relevant US Treasury bond) for new issues have gradually narrowed, while yields in the secondary market have continued to decline. At the same time, there have been several exciting new developments in the Latin American sector in the past year, partly aimed at enhancing their appeal to investors. These include the launch of larger, more liquid issues; the issuance of bonds in a wider range of currencies; and a noticeable trend towards longer maturities. Five- and 10-year bond issues have become a more common occurrence, and Pemex (the Mexican state oil company) issued a Dollars 250m, 30-year Yankee bond with a coupon of 8 5/8 per cent last year. Cemex, the largest cement company in Mexico, set the trend for larger issues with the launch of a Dollars 1bn, five-year eurobond issue in May 1993. This was the biggest eurobond issue ever by an emerging market name. Since then, the Republic of Argentina has raised Dollars 1bn with a global bond issue, and at the start of 1994, Bancomext, Mexico's state- owned import and export bank, launched the first global Dollars 1bn 10-year deal for a Mexican borrower. Larger bond issues are obviously more liquid in the secondary market, a factor which is appreciated by international investors who tend to complain about the poor liquidity of Dollars 100-200m issues. Emerging market specialists point out that there is much more investor interest in these large liquid issues. In addition, the more frequent Latin American borrowers in the international bond market have become more adventurous currency-wise, braving the non-dollar currency sectors: for example, the Republic of Venezuela has issued D-Mark eurobonds, while Pemex has issued Canadian dollar, sterling and French franc eurobonds. Mr Ian Tweedley, director at West Merchant Bank, points out that by issuing in other currencies, Latin American borrowers have been able to reach a wider range of investors, and this process of diversification seems likely to continue. * Emerging Bond and Money Market Guide, published by Kleiman International Consultants, 6215 32nd Place, NW Washington, DC 20015.</p>

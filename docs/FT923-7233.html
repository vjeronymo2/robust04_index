			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / UK Company News: BT to spend Dollars 1bn on global telecommunications network BRITISH Telecommunications is planning to invest about Dollars 1bn (Pounds 500m) over the next ten years to build a network outside the UK to support its ambition to become the world's leading telecommunications group. The investment project, code-named Cyclone, will start with the installation next year of four large computerised exchanges in New York, Frankfurt, London and Sydney. These will be followed by a further 28 switching centres in main business centres worldwide. The aim of the project is to put in place infrastructure which several different BT business units could then use to provide multinational customers with a range of voice, data and video services. But it is not clear how the project will interface with other BT global initiatives  - in particular Syncordia, a US-based subsidiary which provides sophisticated telecommunications services to multinationals, and Global Network Services, the international data networking venture. Mr Graham Wilde, vice president of CIT Research, a UK telecommunications consultancy, said: 'I am not sure even they know exactly what they are doing.' BT refused to comment on the project. The group is understood to view Cyclone as an important step in its plan to steal a march in the international telecommunications business over rivals such as American Telephone &amp; Telegraph of the US, the UK's Cable and Wireless, Germany's Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom. As the telecommunications industry opens up to competition, such groups are considering similar initiatives to BT's. But their plans are mostly not as definite or advanced. In most countries, regulations protecting national monopolies would currently prevent BT from offering the full range of services it envisages. However, the company has decided to take the initiative by anticipating and pushing for changes in regulations. Mr Iain Vallance, BT's chairman, has repeatedly predicted that international regulations will change in response to customer demand and advances in technology. Mr Wilde said BT's approach was one of 'shoot first and ask questions later.' In a separate development, BT announced yesterday that it had signed a contract to provide BP Chemicals with a fully managed European network. The network will use services supplied by both Syncordia and GNS.</p>

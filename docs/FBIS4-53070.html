			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 16 KYODO -- Vice Finance Minister Jiro  Saito restated Monday [16 May] his worries about the delayed  fiscal 1994 budget and confirmed that a planned supplementary  stopgap budget will not include new policy outlays.    "With no new policy measures such as fresh public works, I  can't say that there will be no effects on the economy at all,"  Saito told a regular news conference.    Last week, the government decided to supplement a 40-day 11  trillion yen provisional budget on the 40 trillion yen budget  for fiscal 1994 that started April 1. The stopgap budget  expires on May 20.    Diet deliberations on the full budget, deadlocked due to  political turmoil, is expected to begin soon with still  lingering uncertainties.    Saito said details of the planned supplementary budget is  still undecided, but noted that new policy outlays will not be  included as in the provisional budget.    "That's why we are calling for early passage of the full  budget," he said.    Turning to tax issues, Saito said current laws do not allow  for different advisory panels to the prime minister to form a  joint subcommittee, thus denying such reported plans by the tax  and administrative reform committees.    He also brushed aside reports that some members of the  coalition parties are insisting that deciding on permanent  income tax cuts alone and leaving offsetting tax hikes would be  sufficient measures to take as Japan promised to do only that in  its March market-opening package.    "I shouldn't comment on things that I haven't heard," saito  said.    But referring to Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's policy  speech,  he noted, "we are to decide on full tax reform in June and make  it into law by the end of the year."</p>

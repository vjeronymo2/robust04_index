It also abolished the law on the elections of the autonomous  republic's representative body, adopted by the Georgian Supreme  Soviet on 9 July of that year, during Zviad Gamsakhurdia's rule,  which stipulated a quota for deputies of Abkhaz ethnic origin  higher than the total number of all other deputies.    A decision was also taken to transfer the functions of the  Abkhazian Supreme Soviet to the Abkhaz council of ministers in  exile, which is based in Tbilisi, having determined its status  as a temporary body.</p>

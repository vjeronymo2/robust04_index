			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Putting Matters In Their Context"] </F>   [Text] Perhaps the regrettable matters which we found  ourselves having to stand around and talk about are matters  which concern the disappointment that has followed every stage  in our efforts toward an honest, real, and clear coordination  with our brothers in the PLO. Despite all our steps on the  ground that proceeded from the uniqueness of  Jordanian-Palestinian relations and despite everything we took  into consideration before taking any step toward maintaining  this uniqueness, we found ourselves still facing suspicion,  doubts, and questioning. Moreover, despite our concern not to  waste time by refuting false accusations and our concern to work  instead of getting angry, blaming, or turning our backs, our  efforts continued to be futile and our stands continued to be  the last to be trusted and treated clearly by some PLO leaders.  The result was always a loss for us as a nation, a loss for us  as one family, and a loss for us as the owners of a just cause  in which the only requirement to achieve our rights is a sincere  and faithful joint action that is far from any form of  prevarication.    Today, as Amman witnesses another Jordanian attempt to  compensate for the past, correct matters, and place  Jordanian-Palestinian coordination before any useless step taken  with the enemy, we reaffirm the importance of proceeding from  trust and from a feeling, as we sit at one table, that the cause  is that of a generation that has suffered a lot and that of  generations which we cannot allow to inherit disappointment. We  also reaffirm that national and pan-Arab concern over our rights  requires us to feel that we are sitting together as brothers and  not as those lying in wait for each other. Indeed, it is  ridiculous to believe that the Israeli is closer to the  Palestinian than the Jordanian is to the Palestinian. It is  also ridiculous to believe that the Jordanians can trust the  Israeli side while there are continued doubts and suspicions  between the Jordanians and the Palestinians. No one can tear  apart the unity of or create a substitute for this one family  that has been united by four decades of pain, hopes,  steadfastness, perseverance, and many dreams. Those who do not  fear God in what they think, do, seek, or imagine achieving, or  think it is possible to side with the enemy at the expense of  the brother will only reap disappointment and loss. Moreover,  they will discover too late that it is hard to continue  deceiving others by deceiving themselves. This tragedy has not  just begun. What we are witnessing now is the natural result of  all those years of such an attitude.</p>

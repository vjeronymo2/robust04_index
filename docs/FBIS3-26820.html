Last year the province registered its fastest postal and  telecommunications development. Its total investment in fixed  assets amounted to 530 million yuan, an increase of 61 percent  over 1992. It completed a number of modern telecommunications  projects, including program-controled telephone exchanges,  digital microwave equipment, and optical-fiber  telecommunications equipment, thus doubling its long-distance  telecommunications capacity. It completed 140,000 telephone  exchanges, an increase of 66 percent over the previous year;  direct-dialing telephone calls were available in 91 cities  throughout the province; 86 cities entered the nationwide  long-distance direct-dialing telephone network; and  international direct dialing was possible from 48 cities. The  use of telephone equipment in the province increased by 32  percent over the previous year. In the postal and  telecommunications field, a mail-sorting center was built in  Baoshan and a mail transfer station was built in Luxi.    Postal and telecommunications facilities have been either  constructed or updated. This has promoted the development of  postal and telecommunications services. Last year, postal and  telecommunications business totaled 558 million yuan, 124.6  percent of the annual plan, an increase of 55.6 percent over the  previous year. In 1992 its growth rate ranked 17th in the  country; last year it rose to 14th. The growth rate in the  province's postal and telecommunications business outstripped  the country's average.</p>

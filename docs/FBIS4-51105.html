			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Fan Chun (5400 0689): "The 15 Uncertain Elements About </F> Hong Kong That Communist China Is Deeply Nervous About"]    [Text] There is still more than three years for  Communist China to "decide" on how to take back Hong Kong. But  already there are signs that to deal with "hostile forces" in  Hong Kong, Communist China is going to establish the "right to  hold perpetrators accountable for past acts" to "justify" a  crack down on dissidents when sovereignty is safely in its hands.  <H5>  Red-Headlined Documents and Qian Qichen's Instructions </H5>   On 1 July 1997, a day which marks the 76th anniversary of  the  founding of the CPC, Communist China will restore its  sovereignty over Hong Kong. As this day approaches, when there  will be a change of "national flags," some people are proud and  feel avenged, some feel helpless, and of course there are some  who feel it is the end of the world.... But whatever the  attitude toward the return of Hong Kong in 1997, most agree that  day will not be a happy or bright one.    "What kind of problems will there be during the transfer of  sovereignty?" Like a large unwelcome cloud, this question looms  above the high levels of the CPC as an increasing worry. A  report relayed in early April by the State Council's General  Office, "On problems that may appear during Hong Kong's  transition, the transfer of sovereignty, and the early days of  the Special Administrative Region [SAR] government," drafted by  the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office and the Hong Kong and  Macao Affairs Research Office, highlighted this worry.    The report was issued as a red-headlined document to the  party committees of provinces, autonomous regions, and cities,  the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, and party committees of  the relevant military regions, obviously to get the whole party  and Army mentally prepared. From what Qian Qichen, State  Council vice premier and director of the Preliminary Work  Committee, wrote on the document, we can see that without the  cooperation of British Hong Kong, Communist China's hands are  tied in the latter phase of Hong Kong's transition. Qian Qichen  said in his remarks: We must fully assess changes in the Hong  Kong situation, be fully prepared, and properly handle and solve  problems and be ready with solutions to them in order to  maintain Hong Kong's long-term stability.    Under its requirement for "full assessment" and "full  preparation," the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office report  listed 15 possible serious problems that may occur during Hong  Kong's transition, its transfer of sovereignty, and the early  days of the SAR government. These problems are excerpted as  follows:  <H5>  "British Hong Kong Pushes Executive Council to the Forefront </H5> of Confrontation With the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office"    1. Britain and the British Hong Kong authorities continue to  agitate and sow dissension among high-ranking civil servants.    2. Britain and the British Hong Kong authorities continue to  pick, promote, and groom a group of pro-British and anti-Chinese  elements and install them in the Hong Kong Government and elite  positions in professional circles.    3. Britain and the British Hong Kong authorities appoint  pro-British and anti-Chinese elements to the Executive Council  and push it to the forefront of confrontation with the Hong Kong  and Macao Affairs Office.    4. Britain and the British Hong Kong authorities continue to  rely on U.S. influence and internationalize the Hong Kong  problem.    5. To win over public opinion, Britain and the British Hong  Kong authorities institute a social welfare system like those  pursued in northern Europe which puts an excessive burden on the  SAR government.  <H5>  Reference to Trump Card Held by British Hong Kong That Could </H5> Throw Hong Kong Into Chaos    6. Britain and the British Hong Kong authorities abet and  make use of Hong Kong's anti-Chinese and extreme rightist forces  and hostile forces overseas to turn Hong Kong into a virtually  semi-independent polity or political entity.    7. Britain, together with the United States, Japan, and  their western allies, withdraw all of their capital from Hong  Kong, paralyzing its finances.    8. British capital, led by the Hong Kong and Shanghai  Banking Corporation and Chartered Bank [Standard Chartered Bank]  abruptly announce the end of their domicile in Hong Kong,  causing great confusion in Hong Kong.    9. Britain and the United States grant passports to  anti-Chinese political figures in Hong Kong in support of their  activities to oppose China and create chaos in Hong Kong to keep  it in turmoil.    10. Britain and the British Hong Kong authorities abet and  support anti-Chinese political forces in Hong Kong in collusion  with Taiwan's anti-communist forces and "Taiwan Independence"  forces to pursue activities opposing China and creating chaos in  Hong Kong.    Reference to Possibility That British Hong Kong  Would Deprive SAR Government of Functioning Government  Bureaucracy    11. Abetted and controlled by Britain and the British Hong  Kong authorities, a large number of civil servants resign or  retire early in order to deprive the SAR government of a  functioning government bureaucracy.    12. Britain and the British Hong Kong authorities  manufacture political incidents. Such incidents will be fronted  by anti-Chinese hostile forces, which will encourage Hong Kong  citizens to go on strike and close up shop so that there is  turmoil during the transfer of political power.    13. Britain supports or plans for hostile forces in Hong  Kong to engineer violence and conduct assassinations and  sabotage with a view to creating chaos in Hong Kong during the  transfer of sovereignty, causing foreign capital to leave and  the industrial and commercial sectors to divert their funds.    14. During the transition, Britain and the British Hong Kong  authorities use their executive and judicial prerogatives to  purge, persecute, or threaten patriotic and Hong Kong-loving  industrialists and businessmen, middle and high-ranking civil  servants, and former or incumbent legislative and executive  councillors who do not agree with Britain's violation of the  Sino-British Joint Declaration and the agreements between the  two countries.    15. During the transition and the transfer of sovereignty,  Britain and the British Hong Kong authorities continue to  monopolize Hong Kong's finances and rob it of its money under  the cover of construction projects, franchises, and contract  awards to maintain Britain's economic and financial privileges  in Hong Kong for a long time after its withdrawal.  <H5>  Hong Kong Policy Doubted and Questioned by the Military </H5>   It is surprising that the scenarios "conceived" by the  report  about Hong Kong's prospects are so horrific and apocalyptic.  Communist China has always said that it has the ability to  maintain Hong Kong's prosperity and stability. However, after  Zhongnanhai has played all of its trump cards, the initiative is  now in the hands of British Hong Kong. The report stressed  specifically that some of the 15 scenarios had occurred during  the signing of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, some are  continuing, some are being planned, and some are very likely to  occur during the transfer of political power. For Communist  China, a "small move" by the other side would be enough to dim  the luster of the pearl of the Orient.    The Hong Kong policy has been severely challenged within the  CPC. At first, Communist China adopted a "high-handed" approach,  as if once Chris Patten tabled his political reform package to  the Legislative Council, the People's Liberation Army [PLA]  would immediately "liberate" Hong Kong. However, when Chris  Patten's package was tabled to the council, Communist China  could not move further.... To deal with inner-party  dissatisfaction, especially within the Army, during this  two-year period, Qian Qichen attended sessions at the invitation  of the PLA deputy group to answer questions. The question put  by the PLA deputy group was very candid: "What specific  measures does our government's have given Britain's  confrontational and noncooperative stance?"  <H5>  Qian Qichen Puts Forward Five Options for Taking Back Hong </H5> Kong    Qian Qichen was very clever in fielding the question. Unlike  previous times when he gave clear-cut answers, he put forward  five options, without saying who had the right to decide on  which option or providing the basis of the options.    Qian Qichen's five options were:    1. Before 1997 or in early 1995, form a SAR government  according to the Basic Law and begin work on the changeover --  this is an option for reduced disruption and confrontation with  Britain.    2. If the situation changes, the schedule must be advanced  to have a basic framework for the SAR government in place by  mid-1996, and by then preparations for the SAR should be coming  to an end.    3. If the present situation continues and Britain persists  in undermining the Sino-British Joint Declaration and negating  the agreements between the two governments, the Chinese  Government will, at the right time, inform the British  Government of the end of its rule in Hong Kong.    4. In case of violent political turmoil and prolonged  political strife during the transition or the appearance of an  "international political city," "political entity," or  "semi-independence" masterminded by British Hong Kong, take  action to recover Hong Kong immediately.    5. The National People's Congress Standing Committee has the  right to order or authorize necessary measures.  <H5>  Begin Drafting the "Right To Hold Perpetrators Accountable </H5> for Past Acts" To Deal With Hong Kong Dissidents    There is still more than three years for Communist China to  "decide" on a way to take back Hong Kong. There is still time.  But already there are signs that to deal with "hostile forces"  in Hong Kong, Communist China is going to establish a "right to  hold perpetrators accountable for past acts" to "justify" a  crackdown on dissidents when sovereignty is safely in its hands.    At a seminar held at the Jingxi Guesthouse on 26 March,  which  was attended by persons-in-charge of the military, armed police,  public security, and the militias, the public security and  military suggested applying the right to hold perpetrators  accountable for their past acts in Hong Kong and Macao. There  would be three "retroactive periods:"    1. The period after the signing of the Sino-British Joint  Declaration;    2. After the promulgation of the Hong Kong SAR Basic Law;    3. After Britain unilaterally stopped cooperating in the  transition, forcing China to publicize diplomatic documents.    Xu Huizi [Central Committee member and deputy chief of PLA  General Staff] stressed specifically that the PLA supported and  assisted public security and the armed police in maintaining  public order in the country and cracking down on hostile forces  and elements, including hostile forces and elements based in the  Chinese territory of Hong Kong and Macao and aimed at  overthrowing the Central People's government and the CPC-led  socialist system.    This is an alarming move. No wonder some mainland people are  discussing this matter, saying that the first thing Communist  China will do after recovering Hong Kong is to crack down on  counterrevolutionaries!    Will the tragic "Movement To Suppress  Counterrevolutionaries"  in the mainland of those years be replayed in Hong Kong?</p>

			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Survey of Nigeria (15): Industrial production falls - The failure of import substitution BY ANY yardstick Nigeria is under-industrialised. In a Dollars 30bn market with a population of more than 90m people, manufacturing accounts for only 8.5 per cent of GDP, well below the average for countries at this stage of the development cycle. Indeed, in the past 11 years manufacturing value added (MVA) has grown at a mere 1.5 per cent annually, which means that on a per capita basis, industrial production has been falling. There can be few more classic examples in Africa of the failure of import substitution. The latest survey by the Manufacturers' Association of Nigeria (MAN) covering the first half of 1992 tells the story: capacity utilisation of 34.5 per cent for manufacturing as a whole, lowest in vehicle assembly, steel and engineering and electronics and highest in wood and furniture textiles plastics and rubber, food and non-metallic minerals, primarily cement, Over the past three survey periods, imported raw materials have averaged 55 per cent of the total, while value added in manufacturing as a whole was estimated in 1989 at 46 per cent compared with 92 per cent in the oil sector and 83 per cent in agriculture. Aside from mainstream consumer goods the main investment interest in recent years has focused on downstream oil and gas activities and textiles. In a high inflation, high devaluation economy, it is hardly surprising that entrepreneurs should have targeted trade and finance rather than manufacturing. Pretax returns on investment are highest in trading (up to 100 per cent) followed by construction (50 per cent) and the finance sector (30 per cent). Five crucial constraints to industrialisation in Nigeria have been identified: Poor profitability relative to trade, finance and construction; Infrastructural and regulatory constraints which mean that operating costs are up to a third higher in Nigeria than elsewhere. Investment costs are estimated to be some 50 per cent above international standards. The high risk climate of political and economic uncertainty that makes long-term planning extremely difficult. The absence of an enabling environment in terms of macro-economic stability, observance of legal contracts, inadequate patent law provisions, the high and escalating crime rate, etc. Restrictions on ownership in the form of the Nigeria Enterprise Promotion Decrees (NEPD). There is no quick-fix way out of this morass, though there are at least two administrative steps the Shonekan government could take during its brief tenure: first, amend the NEPD, thereby allowing foreign firms already in Nigeria to have majority ownership of their subsidiaries, and, second, abolish the existing system whereby new investments must run the gauntlet of official approval through the IDCC, and setting up an investment promotion agency to replace the existing approval machinery. The accelerated depreciation of the naira over the past year will boost local sourcing and exports, but there are still some hard policy choices to be made. The privisation agency's gloomy conclusion that the country's six vehicle assembly plants cannot be privatised because of low capacity utilisation and deteriorating commercial and financial performance underscores the need for a new strategy towards capital intensive low-value added activities where Nigeria has no competitive advantage. Yet, the federal government has actually increased its investment in capital-intensive manufacturing, through the recapitalisation of Savannah Sugar and new investment in the Ajaokuta steel project, the aluminium smelter, the fertiliser industry and Nigerian Machine Tools. One of the first tasks of the incoming civilian administration later this year will be to develop a coherent industrial strategy, which, in all probability, will mean some short-term de-industrialisation as low value added, highly protected activities are restructured or allowed to go under. Industrial growth will have to come from labour-intensive, consumer goods activities as well as upstream and downstream petroleum and gas-related manufacturing.  ------------------------------------------------------------ MANUFACTURING OUTPUT  ------------------------------------------------------------ Year                      Index  ------------------------------------------------------------ 1985                        100 1986                         78 1987                        131 1988                        135 1989                        154 1990                        215 1991                        183 1992                        231  ------------------------------------------------------------ Source: Central Bank of Nigeria  ------------------------------------------------------------</p>

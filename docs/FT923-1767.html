			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Survey of Northern Ireland (8): Breaking out of isolation - Transport and Telecoms NORTHERN Ireland has moved transport and telecommunications rapidly up its economic agenda. There are pressing reasons for it to do so. As well as its peripheral position within Europe, the EC's commitment to creating new transport links between Europe and the Republic of Ireland - the only country not joined to the EC by road or rail - after the opening of the Channel Tunnel will have important effects on the province's ports, particularly Larne, Ireland's main roll-on, roll-off (ro-ro) harbour. About a quarter of Larne's freight traffic either comes from or is going to the Republic of Ireland. The short crossing to Scotland - from Larne and Cairnryan - is the favoured route of road hauliers heading for the rest of Britain and on to Europe. A General Consumer Council report, written last year by transport studies professor Austin Smyth from the University of Ulster, suggested that improvements to the region's transport system should be viewed in a Irish single market context. 'Pursuit of the local interest in either Northern Ireland or Eire will only reinforce our problems of relative accessibility,' Professor Smyth says. The report made a number of recommendations aimed at countering perpherality. Professor Smyth's suggestions include more direct air services from the province to continental destinations, the upgrading of the A75 from Stranraer to the M6 to improve travelling times to England and continued improvements to Ulster's ports allowing them to maintain their competitive edge. Another recommendation - the use of high-speed catamarans - has become a reality with the introduction of the 90-minute SeaCat Belfast to Stranraer service in June. Hoverspeed, the Seacat operator, says passenger numbers are ahead of schedule and claims Belfast traders have benefitted from an increase in Scottish visitors. Increased trade is one of the most important factors behind the drive to improve cross-border transport. In 1991, Belfast Port had a record trading year with a 6 per cent increase, bringing the total number of goods handled to 9.4m tonnes. About 50 per cent of the port's total throughput is now accounted for by ro-ro and lift-on, lift-off container traffic. The increase came as a result of the addition of a third ship on the Belfast to Heysham service, the decision by Railfreight Distribution to channel all its Irish container traffic through Belfast and the introduction of a new Belfast to Liverpool ro-ro service. European links have also been strengthened by the introduction of a new container service to Le Havre and the provision of large ships on the Rotterdam and Oslo routes. More than 55 per cent of Ulster's seaborne trade is now shipped through Belfast Port, which is undergoing a 10-year capital expenditure programme of over Pounds 100m, aided by EC grants. Measures, it would seem, are having some success. Last year, the Department of the Environment's digest of statistics summarising transport trends in the province found domestic freight on Ulster roads  - regarded as one of the least congested systems in the UK - had increased by 77 per cent between 1987 and 1990. The report also said transport at Northern Ireland Airports, which runs Belfast International Airport and which has invested heavily in the airport, had increased by 20 per cent - scheduled and chartered movements growing by 19 per cent and 25 per cent respectively. Between 1985 and 1990, Belfast City Airport had the highest growth rate in Britain in terms of terminal passengers. The Northern Ireland Centre in Europe - the province's gateway to the European Commission - has been lobbying hard for a Brussels-Belfast air link. Work in progress includes the building of Belfast's new cross-harbour road and rail bridges which will significantly reduce travelling times between the north and south of Ireland. The Commission has also been involved in a study into the costs of upgrading the main Belfast to Dublin rail line. The modernisation of the line, which should lead to faster journeys between the capital cities, will cost over Pounds 65m. Although Northern Ireland had one of its worst ever years for inward investment last year, the province received 130 first-time visits by companies interested in investing in Europe. One of the main attractions for such potential investors in Northern Ireland is the province's telecommunications network - one of the EC's most advanced. Over the past five years British Telecom has invested around Pounds 200m in the local telecommunications infrastructure. In addition to the computerisation of the province's telephone exchanges, the European Commission has invested Pounds 7.25m under its Special Telecoms Action for Regional Development (Star) programme, designed to help Objective One regions - those most in need - to improve communications links. The result has been the completion of a world-leading fibre-optic telecommunications infrastructure linking even the more remote areas of the province. The existence of such an advanced network has had an important effect on the local economy. With distance eliminated, work can be carried out far from its original source. This has led, for instance, to London directory inquiry calls being answered in Northern Ireland and Ulster civil servants working on social services claims from the Home Counties. This has meant the creation of jobs. Of the 430 jobs lobbied for by the Industrial Development Board last year, 350 were such 'back office' posts which did not require public financial assistance. Figures for 1990/91 are even more striking, with over 1,000 jobs created involving investment of Pounds 25m in buildings and equipment and Pounds 10m in wages. In July, Mercury Communications landed its telecommunications cable in Northern Ireland. Mercury has spent the past five months installing underground cables to make the final link-up from Northern Ireland to the rest of Britain. The cable has been laid via the Isle of Man where there is a repeater unit boosting the telecommunications' signals to or from the province. In spite of recent transport and telecommunications advances, local business people are aware of the difficulties posed by geographic isolation - they have had to live with the additional costs for years.</p>

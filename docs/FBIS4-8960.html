			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ljupco Georgievski, chairman of the Internal </F> Macedonian Revolutionary Organization-Democratic Party for  Macedonian National Unity, by Mariyana Boyadzhieva; place and  date not given: "We Must Tear Down the Berlin Walls of the  Balkans"]    [Text] [Boyadzhieva] How realistic is the idea of creating  a free zone for the movement of people, commodities, and capital  between Bulgaria and Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia -- FYROM]?    [Georgievski] We all must work for tearing down the Berlin  Walls of the Balkans -- the cemented borders which have existed  since the Balkan wars. Our party was the first in the republic  clearly to declare already three and half years ago that it is  impossible to open Macedonia only for Greece and Serbia. This  must apply to all Balkan neighbors, and first of all to  Bulgaria. We all are familiar with an idea which generates a  lot of talk recently. This is the project of constructing a  railroad between Sofia and Skopje, which is supported in our  country. The project of constructing a railroad between the two  countries is older than 100 years. It dates from the time of  the Turkish Empire. After we proposed the idea of connecting  Macedonia to Bulgaria and Albania, SRPSKA POLITIKA carried a  half-page article in which the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary  Organization-Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity  [VMRO-DPMNE] was accused of wanting to partition Macedonia  between Bulgaria and Albania. It is a pity our government did  not initiate this project three years ago, and not now when the  United Nations imposed an embargo against Serbia and Greece -- a  total economic blockade against Macedonia. This is done now not  because the government really wants it, but because of the Greek  embargo. I am afraid that if the Greek embargo is eliminated  within one month the project will be put aside.    It is abnormal when one has to wait for several hours at the  border checkpoints in order to enter another state. I think  that both countries are not doing much to facilitate contacts  between people.    [Boyadzhieva] How does the Greek embargo affect Macedonia?    [Georgievski] This is an anti-European act and its spirit is  anti-Maastricht. The European Community must understand that it  cannot treat Greece as a small child which has unique interests  and caprices, and thus destroy the European spirit.    [Boyadzhieva] What emerged during your meetings with the  Bulgarian politicians?    [Georgievski] All those whom I met clearly declared that the  Republic of Bulgaria steadily adheres to the idea of an  independent and sovereign Republic of Macedonia. It is  especially important that on this issue there is a national  consensus in Bulgaria's foreign policy. I think that the  Bulgarian representatives at all levels must continue their  active policy and defend this position at all forums and  international meetings. I was told that many Serbian  politicians in their contacts with various parties support a  policy of dividing Macedonia. I hear tales about Struma and  Radonos regions, and a division into Bulgarian, Albanian, and  Serbian parts.    [Boyadzhieva] What is your attitude to the U.S. "blue  helmets?" How long do you think they should stay in the  Republic of Macedonia?    [Georgievski] We demanded that the "blue helmets" not serve  under the flag of the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR], but in  accordance with an agreement between our government and the U.S.  Administration. They implemented their mission in Macedonia  with a great success. The chance of a direct Serbian aggression  decreased. The government did not have the courage to outline  the borders, and this was done with barbed wire only after the  U.S. soldiers arrived.    I think that they should remain in the Republic of Macedonia  as long as a danger of destabilizing the country exists, and as  long the sole goal of the Serbian-Greek alliance is to eliminate  our country's independence. I think that our country must do  everything possible to come closer to NATO's structures and thus  to guarantee the total security of its borders.    It is well-known that the Macedonian Army was not trained  independently to fight against a foreign aggression. During  their withdrawal the Yugoslav generals took with them all the  serious military equipment stationed on the territory of the  Republic of Macedonia.</p>

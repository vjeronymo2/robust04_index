			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Affairs Minister Alfred Nzo says  expectations from countries throughout Africa about South  Africa's involvement in the continent's economy will have to be  addressed urgently.    Speaking on his arrival at Addis Ababa in Ethiopia today,  Mr.  Nzo said the result is that the rest of Africa was looking to  South Africa to help the continent out of hunger and poverty.  He told our political staff that the raising of the South  African flag at the OAU headquarters in the city today was seen  by many countries in Africa as a symbolic gesture that South  Africa would satisfy the needs of especially Sub-Saharan  countries. However, he warned against exaggerated expectations.  Mr. Nzo will meet the OAU secretary general, Dr. Salim Ahmed  Salim, today to discuss the role South Africa will play in  improving conditions for underprivileged societies throughout  Africa.    He also said that no plans had been drawn up yet on South  Africa's involvement in a possible UN peace force for Rwanda.</p>

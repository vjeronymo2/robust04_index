			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Survey of Malaysia (16): Politics impede progress / State profile, Kieran Cooke visits the remote wonders of Sabah 'WELCOME TO the last frontier,' said an official of the state government in Sabah. The state, in the far north of the island of Borneo, certainly feels remote from the rest of Malaysia. It takes two and a half hours to fly from Kuala Lumpur to Kota Kinabalu, Sabah's capital - longer than the flight from Kuala Lumpur to Bangkok, and not much shorter than the journey from the Malaysian capital to Hong Kong. Kota Kinabalu, on the South China Sea, has only 200,000 people and the pace of life is considerably slower than on the Malaysian peninsula. The people are different: there are more than 50 groupings of native peoples with distinct languages and dialects. There are settlers from the peninsula, plus Chinese, mostly the descendants of immigrants who came south in search of work more than 100 years ago, during the time when the British North Borneo Company had control over the territory. It is a wild and beautiful land, still relatively undiscovered by tourism. Though it is the second biggest state, after Sarawak, in the Malaysian Federation, it has a population of only 1.7m. Commodities - mainly timber, cocoa and palm oil - dominate the economy. There is only a small manufacturing sector in Sabah. Agriculture accounts for 37 per cent of GDP, compared with 17 per cent in peninsular Malaysia. Though the good economic times are rolling in most of the rest of Malaysia, Sabah is going through a difficult period. Part of the problem is its remoteness and its lack of infrastructure. But politics is also involved. Since it joined the Malaysian Federation in 1963, Sabah has had a variety of governments, which in some cases ran the state like a private fiefdom. There were occasional clashes with the federal authorities, but on the whole Kuala Lumpur was content to leave Sabah politicians to themselves - so long as they gave their support to the Barisan Nasional, the National Front government. But things changed in 1990. Shortly before federal elections, Sabah's ruling party, Parti Bersatu Sabah (PBS), pulled out of the National Front and threw its weight behind the opposition to the government of Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime minister. Against the odds, the National Front won the election, though the PBS still retains its hold on power in Sabah. Politicians and local businesspeople agree that the economy has suffered as a result of Sabah's breakaway from central government. While growth has been averaging more than 8 per cent per year in Malaysia as a whole, in Sabah it has declined to under 5 per cent. There are allegations from the PBS and others that Kuala Lumpur is withholding federal development funds. 'We were once one of the richest states in Malaysia,' says one PBS member. 'Now we are one of the poorest.' One frequently heard gripe is that Sabah receives only a 5 per cent share of revenues from the state's petroleum resources. There is also concern expressed by the PBS that the United Malays National Organisation (Umno), the main party in government, is now for the first time organising in Sabah. PBS people allege Umno will be a divisive element in Sabah's multi-racial political system. While Dr Mahathir and other Barisan partners have made no secret of what they regard as Sabah's political treachery, the prime minister's supporters in Sabah say the federal government still puts far more funds into the state than it takes out. 'Kuala Lumpur has put an enormous amount of money into Sabah,' says Mrs Dayang Mahani, a member of the Sabah assembly and an Umno supporter. 'We should be part of the great developments going on elsewhere in the country - but the PBS has upset Sabah's relations with the federal government and as a result all Sabahans are suffering.' Mrs Dayang Mahani also rejects PBS allegations that Umno will cause trouble in Sabah. 'They say Umno will threaten Sabah's harmony. But there has been no political harmony.' All parties seem to agree that Sabah has not received anything like the investment - both foreign and domestic - that has been going to most other states in Malaysia. But this trend was evident before the election split of 1990. Sabah's remoteness means that costs are considerably higher than on the peninsula - calculated at about 25 per cent above the national level. Its vast land is sparsely populated, and infrastructural development is expensive. Four-wheel drive vehicles are the norm in Sabah - it is only recently that a tarred road connected the west to the east coast. Many roads are only logging tracks. Successive governments have tended to indulge in project politics - investing large amounts of funds in schemes to win votes, rather than with any overall development plan in mind. The PBS government has encouraged downstream development of the timber industry. But so far this has been limited mainly to sawmills for cut timber products. A large-scale cocoa planting programme was started in the late 1970s. Malaysia has now become one of the world's top four cocoa producers, and Sabah accounts for about 70 per cent of the country's total crop. Malaysia, through its Sabah-based Cocoa Board, is acknowledged to be a leader in cocoa research and development. But cocoa prices have in recent years been steadily falling, and are now at a their lowest for nearly 20 years. Some plantations are already replacing their cocoa with palm oil, while acres of other cocoa land are being abandoned. Another problem - and a very sensitive political issue - is Sabah's immigrant population. Historically, Sabah has acted as a collection point and crossroads for travellers between the Philippines, Indonesia and the Malay peninsula. Thousands of people from Mindanao, in the southern Philippines, have fled to Sabah over the years as a result of fighting between Manila's military and separatists based in Moslem Mindanao. Other people from the Philippines and from Indonesia have arrived in search of jobs. There are no exact figures of just how many immigrants - legal and illegal - are now in Sabah. Some estimates put the figure as high as 800,000, or nearly half the population. On one hand, there is concern about the immigrants' use of large amounts of vital educational and health funds. According to some, immigrants are responsible for a rising crime rate. But on the other hand it is also realised that without the immigrants the economy would collapse: it is estimated that about 80 per cent of workers on the plantations are from either the Philippines or Indonesia. Yet despite its present difficulties, Sabah is potentially one of the richest states in Malaysia. It has a large amount of still untapped natural resources. Further development of the petroleum industry is likely. Perhaps most important of all, Sabah has great potential as a tourist destination. The visitor is spoilt for choice: to climb Mt Kinabalu (at 4,101 metres, Malaysia's and south-east Asia's highest mountain), to dive at Sipadan off the east coast (acknowledged as offering some of the best diving in the world), to wander in search of the proboscis monkey, or to wonder at the Rafflescia, the largest flower in the world. It's all there in Sabah - and much more.</p>

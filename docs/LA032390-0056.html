			<p><P> March 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS GOVERNOR;  </P> <P> VAN DE KAMP TO FIRE ON FEINSTEIN WITH FIRST NEGATIVE AD IN RACE  </P> <P> Pow!  </P> <P> It didn't take long for the TV commercials in the California governor's race to  turn negative.  </P> <P> In one of the earliest such attacks in recent state political history, Democrat  John K. Van de Kamp plans to run ads this weekend that accuse Dianne Feinstein  of mismanaging San Francisco when she was mayor from 1978 to 1988.  </P> <P> Van de Kamp once ignored Feinstein, his opponent in the June 5 primary, and  concentrated on the presumptive Republican nominee, U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson.  </P> <P> But he started attacking her record after she rocketed to a 19-point lead over  him in the most recent Los Angeles Times Poll.  </P> <P> She also led Wilson by 11 points in the same survey. A dramatic biographical ad  she ran about herself in February was credited with her rise in the polls.  </P> <P> Van de Kamp spokesman Duane Peterson refused Thursday to discuss the negative  commercial with a Times reporter who has seen it and said at one point: "It is  not on the air yet and it is our private property and whoever showed it to you  is breaking the law."  </P> <P> Peterson also refused to grant an interview with the person who did the  research for the Van de Kamp ad, deputy campaign manager Vicky Rideout.  </P> <P> The Van de Kamp attack on Feinstein's record is standard in the TV-dominated  world of modern politics, where negative spots have been found to be very  effective. The ad is not a personal attack on Feinstein, which distinguishes it  from the most controversial ads of the genre.  </P> <P> But the cassette of the Van de Kamp ad provided television stations is labeled  "bio/Van de Kamp campaign" even though it is not a biography of Van de Kamp.  This makes it difficult for anyone reading the label to know that it is an  attack on Feinstein.  </P> <P> But the ad most definitely is not about Van de Kamp. It is about Feinstein and  it is tough.  </P> <P> "She was cited for dumping a billion gallons of sewage in the Bay," it begins,  showing a photo of Feinstein alongside a newspaper headline reading: "Billion  Gallon Sewage Spill -- SF Faces Fine." The ad goes on to make five other  specific charges about Feinstein's stewardship of San Francisco.  </P> <P> But the Van de Kamp attack takes some liberties with the record of Feinstein,  who was named one of the top municipal executives in the nation by an industry  magazine in 1987. For one thing, Feinstein actually built a sewage treatment  system for the city during her tenure and the Bay is cleaner today than it has  been in years.  </P> <P> The 30-second spot, produced for Van de Kamp by the Washington firm of Doak,  Shrum &amp; Associates, ends with a tagline that says: "Dianne Feinstein: If  she couldn't manage a city, how could she manage California?"  </P> <P> The attack is a sharp departure in strategy for Van de Kamp, who said several  months ago that he hoped the governor's campaign would be a discussion of the  issues, including the November ballot initiative on the environment, which he  is sponsoring.  </P> <P> Word of the Van de Kamp attack ad reached the Wilson campaign Thursday, where  there was jubilation.  </P> <P> Wilson press secretary Bill Livingstone said he fully expected Feinstein to "go  negative now and point out John Van de Kamp's record in the Hillside Strangler  case."  </P> <P> That was a reference to Van de Kamp's decision as Los Angeles County district  attorney a decade ago not to seek a murder conviction of Hillside Strangler  Angelo Buono. The judge turned the case over to the state and it got the  conviction. Van de Kamp has since called his decision "an error in judgment."  </P> <P> But Feinstein's chief consultants, William Carrick and Hank Morris, said  Thursday they had not decided whether to attack Van de Kamp in TV ads.  </P> <P> "This attack on Dianne is right in line with the Van de Kamp strategy," Morris  said. "Just as his campaign tried to emphasize the ballot initiatives he is  sponsoring, the plan all along was to do anything but emphasize Van de Kamp  himself. They know if they do that they will lose."  </P> <P> Carrick charged that "Van de Kamp has no credibility for these attacks on  Dianne" because Van de Kamp's own biographical spot implies that he supports  the death penalty by showing a photo of a gas chamber and saying that as  attorney general Van de Kamp has kept 277 people on Death Row in California.  </P> <P> "But it is totally fraudulent because Van de Kamp is opposed to the death  penalty and said on Century Cable recently that he would not vote for capital  punishment if he were in the Legislature."  </P> <P> Van de Kamp's attack ad is scheduled to run in Los Angeles, San Francisco and  Sacramento, according to TV industry sources, but he could change that today.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS: THE TV CAMPAIGN The race: Governor. Whose ad? Democratic  candidate and current Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp. Target of ad: His  opponent, former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein.  </P> <P> What the ad says, with an analysis by Times political writer Keith Love:  </P> <P> Ad: "She (Feinstein) was cited for dumping a billion gallons of sewage in the  bay."  </P> <P> Analysis: The city was cited when it had an antiquated sewage treatment system  that was in place when Feinstein became mayor in November, 1978. What the ad  does not say is that Feinstein built a state-of-the-art sewage system that now  gives primary and secondary treatment to all effluent dumped into San Francisco  Bay.  </P> <P> Ad: "The D.A. found her administration in daily violation of laws on hazardous  waste."  </P> <P> Analysis: Under Feinstein, the city of San Francisco was told by the district  attorney in 1985 -- seven years after she became mayor -- that the handling of  toxic wastes was badly in need of upgrading. She eventually appropriated money  to hire more toxics inspectors and specialists.  </P> <P> Ad: "Pressured by oil interests, she refused to campaign for Proposition 65,  the toxics initiative."  </P> <P> Analysis: Feinstein actually held a press conference on Sept. 20, 1986 to  endorse Prop. 65. But Feinstein acknowledges that she later met with Chevron  Oil Co. executives and discussed Prop. 65. Asked if she had then tried to get  out of the campaign, she said could not remember -- "This wasn't a huge  incident in the life of a busy mayor."  </P> <P> Ad: "The federal courts found her Fire Department out of control."  </P> <P> Analysis: That was a judge's complaint about the city Fire Department's alleged  racial bias. A federal court found that her Fire Department was guilty of  discrimination, a situation that had plagued previous mayors. Feinstein's final  budget appropriated $2.5 million to hire 48 new firefighters, most of which  were minorities.  </P> <P> Ad: "And hundreds died due to city ambulance failures."  </P> <P> Analysis: The San Francisco Chronicle reported that cardiac arrest victims were  dying needlessly because the city's ambulances were slow to respond and were  not equipped with defibrillators to help revive heart attack victims. But San  Francisco Director of Health Dr. David Werdegar said Thursday that the  newspaper report contained "inflammatory charges." He also said, "When we went  to Mayor Feinstein and told her we needed to upgrade our ambulance services,  she immediately found the money in the budget to make a number of changes,  including buying the defibrillators and having our firemen respond to medical  emergencies."  </P> <P> Ad: "She left behind a $180-million deficit the Chronicle called the worst in  history."  </P> <P> Analysis: Feinstein did not leave behind a $180-million deficit, according to  both Feinstein and current city budget officials. Her final budget was  balanced, as required by law, and actually left a surplus of $16 million.  However, the first budget of Mayor Art Agnos for fiscal 1988-89 did project a  deficit of $180 million, which was blamed on Feinstein's use of budget  surpluses for capital expenditures in the 1980s. Feinstein says the deficit was  caused by several factors beyond her control, including a decline in the sale  of hydroelectric power and the settlement of lawsuits that will force Agnos to  give millions of dollars in back pay to some city employees.  </P></p>

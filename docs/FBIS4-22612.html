			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Nikita Yermakov: "Russian Parliamentarism </F> Receives International Recognition: Vladimir Shumeyko's First  Official Visit Abroad"]    [Text] Paris--Over the entire past week, the French capital  was host to the scheduled 91st session of the Interparliamentary  Union, which currently unites 128 parliaments in the world.  Participating in its work in the capacity of chairman of the CIS  Interparliamentary Assembly allowed the head of the upper  chamber of the Russian parliament to take part in the discussion  of some of the most burning issues on the agenda--prevention of  conflicts and the United Nations' role in this; ensuring the  safety of industrial waste storage; and nonproliferation of  nuclear weapons.    Of all the meetings, the most significant were those held  with the heads of the French National Assembly and the Senate,  as well as in Strasbourg with the Council of Europe [CE]  leadership.    "At this point Franco-Russian parliamentary relations are  still not on an equal footing," says Vladimir Shumeyko. "France  has lived under a parliamentary system for about 100 years,  Russia--since 12 December of last year."    One way or the other, however, the dialogue, in which both  parties speak the same language, has begun. It was especially  noticeable during the negotiations in Strasbourg. The topic was  Russia's membership of the Council of Europe.    Until now, the situation was as follows: Russia, which had  the status of a special-invitation observer in the CE, was  refused membership in the organization until it acquired a  democratic constitution and a democratically elected parliament.  Now these conditions have been met, but the CE leadership was in  no hurry to consider Moscow's request until the very last  moment. According to informed sources, such caution was the  result not only of the unpredictability of Russia's development,  which is frightening to some here, but also, among other things,  of the fact that in the past the Russian side was insisting that  exceptions be made for it, and on immediate and unconditional  membership in the CE. Now that the Russian participants in the  dialogue have changed, these demands have been withdrawn. After  the negotiations in Strasbourg, the procedure of acceptance will  begin--quite long and in stages, actually. There are all reasons  to believe, the Russian side assures, that as early as the fall,  or under any circumstances before the end of the year, Russia  may become a full-fledged member of the Council of Europe, and  feel like a normal democratic power, participating in the  solution of European problems in this capacity.</p>

			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Sale of Reebok stake boosts Pentland's profits PENTLAND Group, which in July agreed to buy Adidas from Bernard Tapie Finance, yesterday announced sharply higher interim profits mainly due to interest on cash raised from last year's sale of a 32 per cent stake in Reebok. Pre-tax profits increased more than threefold from Pounds 6m to Pounds 19.7m in the six months to June 30. Interest income contributed Pounds 14m after Pentland raised about Pounds 389m from the sale of its stake in Reebok, the US sports shoemaker, in April and December. The figures were above analysts' expectations and the shares gained 3p to 130p. Mr Frank Farrant, finance director, said underlying businesses such as swimwear group Speedo also performed well. Pentland acquired the Speedo brand, its European distributor and a 39 per cent stake in the North American distributor two years ago. Rationalisation and new product sales from Speedo helped lift group operating profits 35 per cent to Pounds 4.2m. Profits from associates, mainly the North American distributor, increased from Pounds 500,000 to Pounds 1.5m. Pentland's net cash position improved more than Pounds 100m to Pounds 266.7m. The Adidas acquisition is to be completed in November and Pentland will pay about Pounds 198m to lift its stake to 95 per cent. Pentland first took a 20 per cent stake in Adidas last year. Mr Tapie agreed to sell the remaining shares when borrowings taken on to finance his purchase of Adidas threatened serious financial problems. Adidas was also perceived to be slipping behind its main rivals, Nike and Reebok, and needed new investment. Mr Farrant said that some of Pentland's leftover cash would be used to strengthen Adidas's finances and develop its brands. Pentland does not expect Adidas to make a profit before 1993, but believes Adidas's margins can be lifted by sourcing from the Far East and cost cutting. 'Adidas's sales haven't fallen but their costs are expensive,' he said. An April agreement for Pentland to source from the Far East for LA Gear, the US sports shoe and clothing maker, did not contribute during the period. However, Mr Farrant expected the agreement, which could be worth Dollars 300m (Pounds 150.7m) of sourcing business a year, to show a contribution in the second half of the year. Earnings increased from 1.42p to 3.69p. The interim dividend is raised 11 per cent to 1.04p. This follows a trebled final dividend last year. Lex, Page 24</p>

			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / US Report into BCCI: Price Waterhouse doubly criticised PRICE WATERHOUSE comes in for criticism in the Kerry report in equal measure for its role as auditor to BCCI and for its lack of co-operation with the committee in providing information. The bulk of the analysis concentrates on why BCCI was allowed to continue operating in spite of alleged fraud and bad practices which went back over many years. Using fragments of PW papers obtained by the committee, it says the firm was raising concerns over the operations of the BCCI Grand Cayman office at least as far back as 1983, when it highlighted 'a high concentration of risk' in loans to prominent clients. In 1984, it noted files containing 'inadequate financial information such that the credit worthiness of the borrow(er) cannot be readily established'. PW made a series of recommendations for reform. The Kerry report says that BCCI did not abide by many of these points, which were reiterated in greater detail every year by PW. Meanwhile the firm continued to sign off the accounts as 'true and fair'. In its 1987 audit report, PW said the repayment performance was 'below expectations' of loans for Dollars 318m to the Gokal brothers and their shipping empire, the Gulf Group. It said security against the lending was probably unenforceable and financial information on the loans 'inadequate'. The report estimates that PW received about Dollars 5m a year for its work on the BCCI audit and related services. It says the UK PW firm declined to co-operate in providing information because of the restrictions precluded by banking confidentiality. It adds that the firm did offer to allow members of the Kerry committee to interview partners in London, but its rules on staff travel did not permit this while the lack of any sub-poenaed documents would have made the value of the trip marginal.</p>

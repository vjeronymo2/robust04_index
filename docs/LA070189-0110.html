			<p><P> July 1, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FACES . . .: PLAYING WITH 'FIRE'  </P> <P> After playing what she calls "the rural slut" and other "angst-ridden  emotional" roles, Lisa Blount was ready to have some fun. And her newest role,  as the young mother of Jerry Lee Lewis' 13-year-old wife and cousin in the  just-released "Great Balls of Fire," provided that opportunity.  </P> <P> "The thing I so much enjoyed about (the character of) Lois was that she's so  very fun-loving. She's so excited about Jerry's success and she's loving it to  the hilt," said Blount, whose past roles -- such as Debra Winger's calculating  girlfriend, Lynette, in "An Officer and a Gentleman" -- have included women who  are anything but positive and uplifting.  </P> <P> But while the young-at-heart, rock 'n'roll-loving Lois was a quite different  role for Blount, playing her brought back memories of the actress's own  upbringing.  </P> <P> "I was thinking of my own mom," she says. "She was young when she had me and  she also enjoyed rock 'n' roll. . . . I remember listening to the old folks --  who were all of about 20 -- rockin' and boppin' in the living room."  </P> <P> And while Lois and the other "Great Balls of Fire" characters are from Memphis,  Tenn., Blount hails from the nearby area of Little Rock, Ark. That factor made  her the perfect dialect coach for much of the cast.  </P> <P> "It just so happens that this (story) was from my place," said Blount, who  worked extensively with co-star Winona Ryder (who plays her daughter, Myra) on  such language aspects as cadence, phrasing, pronunciation and Southern  colloquialisms. Her Southern background even enabled her to contribute some of  her own phrases to the film script.  </P> <P> But the "Great Balls of Fire" role was not merely a homecoming in terms of her  return to the South. Blount said she also felt nostalgic about once again  sharing the screen with Dennis Quaid (who plays Lewis) -- they worked together  in 1976 in her very first movie, "9-30-55." SHAUNA SNOW  </P></p>

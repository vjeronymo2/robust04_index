			<p><P> February 26, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RADIO REVIEW;  </P> <P> SATIRIST STAN FREBERG RETURNS  </P> <P> Stan Freberg, the free-form satirist who first caught the national ear with his  wonderfully spoofy radio shows and then proved that chow mein commercials could  be funny, returns to radio today. He makes his debut as a commentator in some  amusing if non-poisonous 90-second sound bites on KNX-AM (1070) locally and in  syndication nationally.  </P> <P> The strip, called "Stan Freberg Here," will air four times daily on KNX at 4:42  a.m. and p.m. and at 11:42 a.m. and p.m.  </P> <P> Freberg's early targets and tangents include some recent deformations of  language ("My son Donovan asked if he could access the butter"); an interview  with George Washington about his upset at becoming only half of a national  holiday; the rash of substitutes for fur and leather apparel, including  salmon-skin shoes and wallets that start swimming upstream if you fall in the  water; a newly unemployed spy (in the wake of glasnost) opening a shop for  surplus espionage gear, Spies R Us, and so on in the cheeky, chirpy Freberg  tradition.  </P> <P> Like any strip, it is likely to have its ups and down, and 90 seconds doesn't  give a chap much room to get running. But on the early evidence, Freberg is in  fine, irreverent form, with the occasional sharp sting of "Gotcha!" CHARLES  CHAMPLIN  </P></p>

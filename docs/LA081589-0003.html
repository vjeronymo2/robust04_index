			<p><P> August 15, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AL MARTINEZ: SHORT AND SWEET  </P> <P> When Sally Smith agreed to meet me in the lobby of the Airport Marriott Hotel,  I asked how I would recognize her. She replied, "I'm fat and I have auburn  hair."  </P> <P> It was not the kind of response that encouraged further questioning. To have  asked "How fat?" would have bordered on bad manners. Fat and auburn would have  to do.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, when I reached the Marriott there were several fat women in the  lobby and, it seemed to me, many of them had auburn hair.  </P> <P> They were at the cashier's counter, the concierge booth, the gift shop, the  sports store and lined up to get into the restaurant, where a lavish brunch was  being served.  </P> <P> America's Fat Activists, you see, were in town.  </P> <P> Three-hundred members of the National Assn. to Advance Fat Acceptance had  gathered at the Marriott for a six-day convention to plan their national  strategy against "size discrimination."  </P> <P> They are at war with the notion that fatandugly is one word and are attempting  to radicalize America's 70 million fat people.  </P> <P> "There is no blame in being fat," Sally Smith said. She is executive director  of NAAFA. "We are fat as a result of genetics and metabolism, not indolence or  gluttony.  </P> <P> "Forcing us to be thin would be like bleaching black people to make them white.  We don't have a whole lot of choice either."  </P> <P> By the way, I never did recognize Smith by her description, but she recognized  me by mine. I am short and proud.  </P> <P> Smith, who weighs 300 pounds, says that fighting the stereotypes of sizism  isn't easy. They are still called fatso, chubby, pudgy, pig and Fatty, fatty  two-by-four, can't get through the kitchen door.  </P> <P> "We prefer being referred to as fat just as blacks prefer being called black,"  she said. "Overweight implies an arbitrary standard, and obesity sounds like a  disease. We're fat. Period."  </P> <P> When Smith tries to educate the public on size discrimination, very few take  the problem seriously. Fat people are jolly and short people are cuddly, so  what's the big deal?  </P> <P> The big deal is that fat people are being rejected and/or fired from jobs  because of their size and not their qualifications, Smith says. She wasn't sure  about short people, because that is not NAAFA's specialty.  </P> <P> "Even worse," Smith said, "we just heard that in Detroit, a woman who weighed  320 pounds was shot by her father and her sister for being fat and for having  asthma."  </P> <P> "That seems excessive," I said, for lack of a better response.  </P> <P> "Indeed," Smith said, wondering just how I had intended the comment.  </P> <P> "What I mean is, I wonder whether she was shot for being fat or for having  asthma?"  </P> <P> Smith ignored the question, and went on to talk about a letter she received  from a woman whose husband was about to leave her and whose children taunted  her, all for being fat.  </P> <P> "You know what she weighed?" Smith asked. "A hundred and forty-five pounds! If  you're not as skinny as a model, you're rejected. Well, not everyone is going  to look like Cheryl Tiegs!"  </P> <P> I said, "Indeed."  </P> <P> The problem is that we're running short of victims.  </P> <P> Because of a raised consciousness, it is no longer acceptable to make fun of  blacks, Mexicans, gays, Poles, women, drunks, Asians, senior citizens or people  suffering from various forms of lunacy.  </P> <P> The producers of "A Fish Called Wanda" caught hell because a comic character  stuttered, and anyone who makes fun of a Jew risks a commando raid out of Tel  Aviv.  </P> <P> That leaves us, as a friend said, with blimps and shrimps.  </P> <P> "Most fat jokes are atrocious," said Bill Fabrey, who founded NAAFA 20 years  ago. "One of the worst going around is, 'My mother-in-law is fat but she eats  like a bird . . . a vulture.' Ho, ho, ho."  </P> <P> He shook his head. "I got a call one day from a man who collects 'humor.' He  wanted to sell us 156 fat jokes for $1 each. Can you believe that?" Fabrey, 48,  isn't fat, but tells people he's "accredited" because he's married to a fat  person.  </P> <P> He created NAAFA when he began to realize that Fat America had no voice. Today,  the organization has 2,100 members in 37 chapters.  </P> <P> I, for one, wish the fatties well in their effort to wipe out discrimination  based on poundage. I doubt that there will come a day in my lifetime when a  300-pounder will grace the centerfold of Playboy magazine, but I'm a short  person, so what do I know?  </P> <P> There's a Spanish proverb that says women, melons and cheese ought to be chosen  by weight, and perhaps that day is in the offing.  </P> <P> At least the fat is in the fire.  </P></p>

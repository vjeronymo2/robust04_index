			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / International Company News: GM Hughes to shed 4,400 jobs General Motors' GM Hughes Electronics unit has announced that a consolidation of its defence-related business will result in the loss of about 4,400 jobs by 1995, and the closure of its facilities in Fullerton, California. The company said that no restructuring charges are planned. GM Hughes, which announced in March that it was preparing to combine its electronics and defence operations in a newly-formed Hughes Aerospace and Electronics subsidiary, said the cuts were essential in the face of declining defence spending. 'Today, the Department of Defense and our foreign customers are even more cost-driven and Hughes must change to meet those new priorities,' said Mr Michael Armstrong, chairman and chief executive of GM Hughes Electronics. The aerospace and defence, missile systems and systems sectors of Hughes Aircraft, which currently has 51,000 employees, will be combined with the Delco Systems operations of the Delco Electronics unit of GM Hughes. Last year these businesses together accounted for nearly Dollars 7bn of GMHE's Dollars 13.5bn revenues. The new company will have its headquarters in Washington, DC. The plan calls for about 3m sq ft of office and manufacturing space to be vacated in the next 18 months, with Hughes phasing out its 286-acre complex in Fullerton and offering the property for sale. Operations will transfer to other facilities and the systems sector activities in Fullerton will be consolidated in local leased facilities. 'We intend to make this new company a growth company through prudent acquisitions, intelligent investment in new product development and changes in our cost structure and approach to business,' Mr Michael Smith, who has been named chairman of Hughes Aerospace and Electronics, said.</p>

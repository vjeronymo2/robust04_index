			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 28 Apr (TANJUG) -- At a session of the  Central Homeland Administration today, the Serbian Radical Party  [SRS] passed a decision to abolish the Serbian Chetnik Movement  [SCP], a special branch of the SRS, a statement from the party  stresses. The SCP, formed in July 1990, "has in practice  outgrown and superceded by far its original organizational  frameworks, and its internal structure restricts its  functioning." The statement gives several reasons for the  abolition of the SCP. First, all fighters for the freedom of the  Serb nation are nowadays calling themselves Serb Chetniks,  regardless of whether or not they are members of the SRS.    Second, it is stressed that the nature of the Chetnik  movement is deeply patriotic and freedom-loving, and that now  that the movement has been established it should not be reduced  to party, ideological, and political frameworks. The Chetnik  movement is fully established today because it is generally  accepted in all Serb countries, and in the imperilled Serb  countries powerful Serb armies have been formed whose unity in  leadership must not be challenged, the statement says. One of  the reasons for abolishing the movement is that the enemies of  the Serb nation are trying to take advantage of the formal  establishment of the SCP to present it as proof that  paramilitary formations are active in Serb countries, although  Chetnik volunteers act only under the command of the Serbian  Army.    The duplicating of work by the committees of the SRS and SCP  has occasionally caused misunderstandings, the statement says,  and adds as the final reason that members of other political  parties have joined the SCP. The same decision by the Central  Homeland Administration advises all SCP committees in all Serb  countries to integrate with SRS committees.</p>

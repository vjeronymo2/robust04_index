			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Canary Wharf in insolvency: Olympia &amp; York's London subsidiary to go into administration today CANARY WHARF, the east London office development owned by Olympia &amp; York, will today go into administration under UK insolvency procedures. The placing of Europe's largest commercial property development in administration leaves 12 international banks facing losses of up to half their Pounds 1.2bn of loans to the project. It also puts in question plans for the extension into east London of the Jubilee underground rail line and will send a further tremor through the battered property sector, particularly the other new developments in London's docklands. The appointment today of partners from accountancy firm Ernst &amp; Young as administrators may also spell the end of government plans to move more than 2,000 civil servants to Canary Wharf. The prime minister, Mr John Major, has been informed of the banks' decision. Mr Pen Kent, an associate director of the Bank of England, has also been kept informed of developments. At a meeting yesterday afternoon, two UK banks, Barclays and Lloyds, and four Canadian banks, including Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Royal Bank of Canada and Bank of Nova Scotia, voted to put O&amp;Y Canary Wharf Holdings into administration, under UK law. Citibank of the US, Credit Suisse of Switzerland and Credit Lyonnais of France would have preferred to provide Canary Wharf with sufficient funds to continue as a going concern, but they were out-voted. There was little debate at the bankers' meeting as the banks' representatives had arrived for the gathering with instructions from their respective chairmen. Nonetheless, until late last night there was still a question about whether Canary Wharf would be put into receivership. That would mean its chances of re-emerging as a going concern would have been far worse than under administration. The banks decided to make the move for two main reasons: It was a 'condition precedent' of their providing new money that the government rent space at Canary Wharf for more than 2,000 civil servants. However, some banks became tired of waiting for a firm commitment from the government. A legal obstacle arose in Canada which could have prevented the banks being granted new shares in Canary Wharf as a going concern. They wanted the shares as compensation for any new money they put up. If the banks had decided to keep the project as a going concern, they would have had to provide Pounds 20m immediately for Canary Wharf's needs in the coming few weeks and a Pounds 500m facility to meet its longer term requirements. The Pounds 500m requirement was far more than banks had thought earlier that they needed to provide. Some banks hope Canary Wharf may re-emerge as a going concern. They view the administration process as providing a period for negotiations with the government. Under administration, a re-construction plan could be drawn up. Such a plan could still in-volve the banks providing funds for the Jubilee line extension. Before it ran into financial difficulties, O&amp;Y had promised to contribute Pounds 400m to the cost of extending the Jubilee line. The government has made clear that the extension will not be built without this contribution. The administration order will bring Canary Wharf into line with many of O&amp;Y's other subsidiaries, which filed for protection from creditors in Canada and the US recently. The aim would be to produce a reconstruction plan for Canary Wharf by October, when similar plans have to be completed in Canada. To date, banks have provided a core loan of Pounds 566m to Canary Wharf and a finance lease of Pounds 58m. There is also a separate Pounds 450m loan from four Canadian banks and Pounds 100m from the European Investment Bank. Last night, bankers said they would have to make provisions against possible losses of about 50 per cent on loans to Canary Wharf. That would mean they collectively face losses of about Pounds 600m. Barclays has the biggest exposure to Canary Wharf of the UK banks - Pounds 118m in total. Low-tech risks for high finance Page 20 Bank sets aside CDollars 1bn to cover losses Page 30</p>

			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Peers reflect division on Europe A RIGHTWING minister yesterday gave an implicit acknowledgement of the rift within government over Europe, as Maastricht supporters in the House of Lords warned of grave consequences if the treaty was not ratified. As the marathon Lords second reading debate completed its second and final day, Mr Michael Forsyth, a junior employment minister, admitted it was 'bound to be the case that not every minister can agree with every aspect of government policy.' But - interviewed on BBC Radio 4's The World At One - he said that once a decision had been taken, ministers were 'bound by collective responsibility.' There was 'a united front' in the government, he said. He sidestepped a question over whether he was one of the 14 junior ministers whom Mr Edward Leigh, a former minister sacked in last month's reshuffle, has indicated used to meet to discuss their unhappiness over Maastricht. The interview followed Mr Forsyth's presence in the Lords on Monday during the speech by Lady Thatcher, in which the former prime minister called again for a Maastricht referendum. In yesterday's debate, Lord Healey, the former Labour chancellor, highlighted what he called the 'civil war' within the Conservative party, warning it could 'poison Britain's political life' and 'corrupt the British government's policy in every field.' He found it 'particularly tragic' that Conservative infighting had 'played a major role in deepening the crisis in Yugoslavia.' Prime minister John Major's failure to confront 'head on' the type of nationalism espoused by Lady Thatcher had made the 'civil war in the government party a danger to Britain and to Europe as whole.' Viscount Whitelaw, Lady Thatcher's former deputy prime minister, accused Maastricht opponents of taking 'a narrow-minded view' when a broader approach was needed 'in the interests of world peace.' He told those demanding a referendum that parliamentary procedures had stood the test of time and should not be changed on a 'short term, opportune basis.' In another strong speech supporting Maastricht, Lord Callaghan of Cardiff, the former Labour prime minister, said the imperative that impelled the treaty was 'the overriding necessity of preserving the peace and security of the European mainland and hence the British Isles themselves.' But Lord Tebbit, the arch Euro-sceptic and former chairman of the Conservative party, attacked the treaty's proposed move towards monetary union, saying the question that supporters of Maastricht needed to address was whether a single currency was practical, whether it was achievable and whether if achieved it would be in the EC's interests. 'A single currency as chancellor Kohl has explained requires a single government,' Lord Tebbit said.</p>

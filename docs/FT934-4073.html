			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Training must match best international standards Sir, It is good to see, as David Goodhart says ('Training moves up the political agenda', December 2), that training is moving up the political agenda. In engineering we welcome this renewed interest and we at EnTra - the Engineering Training Authority - together with our colleagues at the Engineering Employers' Federation, have responded enthusiastically to employment secretary David Hunt's approach. We are looking forward to the more detailed consultative process which will ensure that the initiative is much more significant than just a new vocational training wheeze. There is, however, one matter on which we should not be misled. There was a sharp decline in the number of apprenticeships in the early 1980s, but this was not only due to the abolition of most of the industry training boards. The Engineering Industry Training Board, our predecessor, was only abolished in July 1991 and the Construction Industry Training Board still retains its statutory role. The reform of vocational training is universally seen as a key to the nation's economic success. We need to ensure that the quality and the quantity of training undertaken match the best in international standards. We shall only do that if we can win the commitment and support of both employers and individuals. We shall not be helped if we do not address the other reasons for the slump of apprenticeship training in the 1980s. K J Jones, chief executive, EnTra, Vector House, 41 Clarendon Road, Watford, Herts WD1 1HS</p>

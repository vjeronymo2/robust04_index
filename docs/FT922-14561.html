			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Monday Interview: Making an art of controversy - Jack Lang, France's minister of education, culture and communications, talks to Alice Rawsthorn If a French conservative were asked to compile a hit-list of the gauche caviar, the sybaritic socialists with a penchant for designer suits and conceptual art, the name of Mr Jack Lang, France's minister of education, culture and communications, would almost certainly be at the top. 'They hate me. They detest me,' he says, with more than a hint of smugness. 'To them I am the devil, the incarnation of immorality, a force for evil.' Mr Lang, who is 52, can afford to be smug. As arts minister, he has become so popular - two out of three French people admire him, according to the opinion polls - that his name was cited in the past fortnight as a candidate to succeed Mrs Edith Cresson as prime minister. After days of uncertainty, President Francois Mitterrand last Thursday chose Mr Pierre Beregovoy, his stolid finance minister. 'Bere' was a safer choice, but the minister of culture would have been more charismatic. As a consolation prize, Mr Lang was given education to add to his old arts portfolio. It is astonishing that Mr Lang's name should have been mentioned at all as potential prime minister. The arts ministry is not generally seen as a springboard to higher things in politics in France or elsewhere. However, he has a close relationship with President Mitterrand, and has emerged at the forefront of French politics through the force of his personality. He worked his way up from the grassroots of the Socialist party after starting his career as a law professor, who made his name in the arts by founding the International Theatre Festival at Nancy in the 1960s. He has never been far from the headlines or from controversy during his time at the culture ministry. There was uproar when Mr Lang and his colleagues fired the conductor, Mr Daniel Barenboim, from the Paris Opera. There was another row last year when, after the sculpture at the Louvre subway station had been defaced by graffiti, Mr Lang announced that he was inaugurating an exhibition of graffiti art. Most recently he has been pilloried in the French press for pinning the Order of Arts and Letters on the chunky chest of Mr Sylvester Stallone, the Hollywood movie star better known for brawn than brain. One columnist said the Croix de Guerre, a military medal, might have been more appropriate. The French press relishes the rumpus over his adventures and misadventures, but so does Mr Lang. 'Where there is hostility there is debate,' he says, with a shrug of the shoulders and an elaborate lift of the eyebrows. 'At least it means people are talking about the arts.' Although he made no secret of his hopes of becoming prime minister, at one point pleading for the job on French television, it is impossible to imagine him enjoying anything as much as his present post. His energy is unquestionable. Night after night he sweeps into exhibition openings accompanied by camera crews. His present projects include the renovation of the 18th-century Palais Royal Gardens, the celebration of the centenary of the death of Rimbaud, the French poet, and the construction of the new national library, the tres grande bibliotheque. Since last May, when he became government spokesman, he has been even more visible than before - preening for the paparazzi in his Thierry Mugler suits outside the National Assembly as he rattles off the official line on the never-ending Gatt negotiations or the socialists' latest diplomatic debacle. The best illustration of his influence is the rise in the proportion of the national budget allocated to the arts. It has increased from 0.46 per cent 10 years ago to 0.98 per cent, or FFr12.98bn (Pounds 1.3bn), this year. This makes France the highest spender on the arts among leading EC countries. The UK, for example, spends just 0.7 per cent. Mr Lang's critics, however, claim that the increased proportion of the government budget going to the arts would be better spent on schools and hospitals. Mr Lang has achieved his funding increase with a policy that combines elements of 1950s cultural dirigisme, such as government subsidy, with modern market forces. He believes that governments should support artists, film makers, musicians and writers so they do not have to depend entirely on the private sector - that is, the giant Hollywood entertainment groups. 'I'm not against all the Hollywood multinationals,' he says. 'But I am against certain groups that impose uniformity. So much of their work is bad. It's bland, it's vulgar, it's boring.' The state's role, he argues, is not to intervene directly in the arts as governments tried to do in the 1950s. Instead, he says, it should create a climate in which artists can work. 'Our role is to provide the best possible environment for artists to work in. We should help to alleviate the pressures on them and then leave them to choose their own direction.' Although he favours government grants, Mr Lang differs from his predecessors in that the multinationals - he recognises the role of the private sector. He cites the US tradition of corporate sponsorship as an important influence, as well as the Arts Council of 1950s Britain and the great Mexican museums. 'The idea that the arts should have nothing to do with the market is an anachronism. In fact it's worse.' His lips curl ready for a really big insult: 'It's petit bourgeois.' His strategy has succeeded in some sectors. The French film industry has flourished. 'If we hadn't developed a national policy for the cinema, our film industry would have died, crushed by Hollywood as it has been in other countries.' Architecture is another success. The monumental modern buildings conceived by President Mitterrand and Mr Lang to commemorate the bicentenary of the French Revolution in 1989, such as the glass pyramid in the Louvre museum and the great arch at La Defense, are regarded as an international model for public sector building policy. The UK's Labour party has included many of the ideas in its arts manifesto. However, some of Mr Lang's new schemes still stir up a fuss. The latest furore is over the tres grande bibliotheque, with its glass storage towers. The original design, say some critics, was ill-conceived: sunlight would have streamed through the glass scorching France's academic treasures. 'Nonsense,' groans the minister. 'Why won't people listen to the experts?' Nevertheless, he has been forced to modify the design, making the towers slightly smaller and storing some books underground. His critics also point to the opening of the Opera Bastille in Paris, which was intended to herald a new era of populist opera with cheap seats. The new opera house operates under the same trade union constraints as the old Opera de Paris and has been dogged by high ticket prices and intermittent strikes. The plight of French television, which comes under his communications portfolio, is even worse. In the early 1980s the Socialists implemented a TV deregulation drive intended to bring private capital into the old state system to launch new channels. Instead French viewers are subjected to apparently endless light entertainment 'spectacles' featuring ageing 'stars' such as singer Johnny Hallyday. The system is dominated by one channel, TF1, which has almost half the audience and more than half of all advertising revenue. Other stations are struggling. The worst case of all is La Cinq, which went off air on Friday after failing to attract enough viewers or advertising. Even Mr Lang appears daunted by the difficulties of French television. 'It isn't perfect,' he admits. 'But what can we do?' It is a testimony to his popularity that he has emerged unscathed from La Cinq's collapse. The length of his tenure at the culture ministry, however, will be determined not by his own policies, but by Mr Beregovoy's attempts to salvage the Socialists' electoral chances before next year's general elections. Perhaps the biggest test of his achievement will be whether France's present enthusiasm for the arts - the crowded art galleries, the lively debates on architecture and the bulging corporate sponsorship budgets - can survive his departure. 'Will it last?' he asks. 'I don't know. We'll have to wait and see.'

			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / International Company News: Nasdaq keeps an early date with Europe / A look at the launch in New York of a pre-dawn market in US stocks By 3.30 Eastern Standard Time this morning a handful of bleary-eyed dealers will have struggled to their desks in New York. Nasdaq, the US over-the-counter-market, is launching a pre-dawn market in US stocks. Half a dozen people will have cut short their usual night's sleep, the market's computers will be fired up and the market supervision division will be staffed by a skeleton crew. The event is both banal and significant. The pre-dawn dealers do not expect a flood of orders for US stocks: European investors, at whom this new market is directly aimed, have not demanded a market in US stocks during their trading morning before. US shares account for only 5 per cent of the trading through Seaq International, London's successful international equity marketplace - though not all trades need to be reported to the London Stock Exchange, making the official figures potentially misleading. Nasdaq says it expects interest to be meagre at first. What demand there is, is likely to come from continental Europe rather than London, it says - a view confirmed by at least one marketmaker on the new market, which points to what it says is already a fairly active market in US stocks among continental European banks. If, however, the new market proves a success, it could open the way for a true transatlantic stock market. Nasdaq says it would then extend the system to European stocks not already registered in the US, and take the market to US institutional investors. Whether they will be awake at 3.30am to buy European stocks is another matter. Nasdaq International is the result of more than two years of effort, and represents significant regulatory concessions by the US Securities and Exchange Commission to allow a US market to compete internationally. Normal market transparency rules have been relaxed: details of trades, though reported to the market authorities, will not be published, save for summary information after the international market closes (at 9am in New York - or 2pm in London). Also, the SEC has granted access to the market to broker-dealers who are not members of the National Association of Securities Dealers, provided they are linked to a member. On one vital issue, however, Nasdaq has yet to get its way - and as a result, most internationally traded US stocks will not appear on Nasdaq International when it is launched today. In certain market conditions, US securities rules forbid broker-dealers from going short in a listed stock in off-market trading. That makes marketmakers on the new Nasdaq International unwilling to quote prices in New York Stock Exchange stocks. Instead, the handful of internationally known Nasdaq over-the-counter stocks - among them Apple Computer and Microsoft - will constitute the market at its launch. Only one marketmaker, the US firm Sherwood Securities, has said it will quote prices in a wide range of securities. Most marketmakers plan to operate from London, not New York. Six - First Boston, Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers, Madoff Securities, Morgan Stanley and UBS Phillips &amp; Drew - will input prices from their City offices today. There will also be three in New York (Sherwood, Herzog Heine &amp; Geduld and Castle Securities) and one in Dallas (Rauscher Pierce Refnes). A handful of brokers will also have access to Nasdaq workstations, while prices for the new markets will be carried by a number of leading quote vendors, including Reuters, Quotron and ADP.</p>

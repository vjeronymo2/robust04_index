			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Business and the Law: High cost of failure to carry out reforms - Legal Briefs The Law Commission, the UK government's law reform body, complained last week that government failure to implement its proposals for reform, particularly in the area of property law, was costing the UK millions of pounds in unnecessary legal fees and court costs. More than half of the 40-plus reports produced by the commission since 1984 remain either under consideration or unimplemented. This is in sharp contrast to 20 years ago. Of the 30 law reform reports submitted to the government between 1966 and 1973, 28 were implemented in an average time of two years.</p>

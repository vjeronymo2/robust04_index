			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Kuwait says it is willing to join in oil output cut KUWAIT YESTERDAY indicated its willingness to join other members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries in cutting the cartel's second quarter output as crude prices received some support from signs at the weekend of an emerging consensus to peg back production by up to 1m barrels a day. Mr Ali al-Baghli, the Kuwait oil minister, said after talks with Mr Alirio Parra, the Opec president, that all Opec members, including Kuwait itself, should be prepared to cut output to shore up recently softer crude prices. 'Cuts are necessary from all states. . . without exception,' he said. Crude prices began the week firmer after Mr Parra's remarks at the weekend that his talks with both the Iranian and Saudi Arabian oil ministers had reached agreement in 'substantial areas'. Mr Hisham Nazer, the Saudi oil minister, said after his meeting with Mr Parra that all Opec members should make pro-rata cuts amounting to 1m b/d at the February 13 meeting in Vienna to decide second quarter production. The March delivery price for North Sea Brent crude rose 52 1/2 cents yesterday to Dollars 17.87 1/2 a barrel. Mr Parra told reporters before flying to the United Arab Emirates yesterday that he had discussed an overall cut in Opec production with Mr al-Baghli. 'I would hope that if we can adjust the foundation for the market to set the rules of the game, that within those rules, prices will strengthen,' he said. Opec set an overall first quarter ceiling of 24.58m b/d at its November meeting, but has seen significant leakage over that figure and a corresponding slip in prices since. Most industry esitmates put present output above 25m b/d. Mr Parra said in Qatar yesterday that the proposed 1m b/d cut would amount to an actual cut of '1.5m b/d or maybe more in view of the current production level'. Industry analysts said yesterday that an Opec commitment to cut output in February would require a renewed and firm commitment to the original November ceiling and then a further real cut of at least 400,000 to 500,000 b/d, bringing total output to around 24m b/d, before oil markets would be convinced of Opec's resolve. Mr Joe Stalislav, of Cambridge Energy Associates, said the 'revenue imperative' was strong for all Opec members, but they had still to work out 'common language and common ground' on the details of an agreement. A decision by Kuwait to curb output would substantially help Opec discipline. The Gulf state has insisted since the Gulf war that it should be immune from any output restrictions while it recovers revenues lost during the war. However, Kuwait is now pumping more than 1.7m b/d, above its formal pre-war Opec quota of 1.5m b/d and oil ministry officials said as early as last year that they might rethink output strategy once production reached present levels. Although the oil ministry has produced a schedule which anticipates production rising to 1.85m b/d for the second quarter and moving up to 2.15m b/d by the end of the year, the ministry has also previously entertained holding output at near present levels so as to allow a comprehensive study of possible damage to the oilfields sustained during the oil fires of 1991. A decision to hold output at present levels, or even cut production slightly, might therefore serve Kuwait's self-interest as well as overall Opec discipline.</p>

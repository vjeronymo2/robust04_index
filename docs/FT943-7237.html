			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / International Company News: Cost-cutting helps turnround at OMV OMV, the Austrian integrated petroleum and chemicals group, has reported consolidated pre-tax profit of Sch240m (Dollars 22m) for the first half, compared with a loss of Sch552m in the corresponding period last year. The partially privatised group said turnover was flat at Sch40.1bn as conditions in many of its markets remained weak. However, it was still aiming to make a profit in the full year through continued cost cutting. As expected, the pre-tax profit in the second quarter, at Sch50m, was considerably smaller than that in the first quarter. This was mainly due to squeezed refinery margins. Also, the exploration and production division fell into a Sch380m loss in the first half compared with a profit of Sch260m, due to lower crude oil prices, lower domestic gas sales and accounting changes. The Schwechat refinery also went into the red in the second quarter because of a slump in gasoline margins, but higher profits at the Burghausen refinery prevented any erosion from the Sch130m profit made by the refining division in the first quarter. It suffered a Sch380m loss in the first half last year. The gas division's profit rose 26 per cent to Sch860m in spite of lower prices and reduced transport business.</p>

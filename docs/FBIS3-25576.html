			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Paid advertisement by African National Congress] </F>   [Text] Should Anyone Walk Away From The Elections? You Be  The Judge.  Our proposals to address the fears of those who feel their  needs have not been met:     -  Voters to cast two votes (one for national  representatives; one for provincial representatives);    -  Provinces to largely control their own finances;    -  Provinces to determine their own legislative and executive  structures;    -  A constitutional principle on self-determination providing  for  consideration of a volkstaat [homeland];    -  Elected provincial representatives to decide on the name of  their province;    -  Provincial powers not to be undermined when the Constituent  Assembly drafts the new constitution.       The ANC [African National Congress] is firmly committed to  peace and democracy. Since the beginning of negotiations, we  have always listened to other points of view. Our aim remains  an inclusive settlement that has the support of all parties.    We believe that our latest proposals remove all reasons for  anyone to stay out of the elections. Of course, we recognise  the right of any party or individual not to take part. But no  one has the right to disrupt the elections.    The elections will be held on April 27. And South Africa  must remain a united nation. We have made concrete proposals.  We have negotiated in good faith. A negotiated settlement is  the only option for South Africa. The door is still open.    A better life for all. Working together for jobs, peace and  freedom.</p>

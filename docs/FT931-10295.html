			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / Observer: Good return Good to see that the six-week Bolshoi ballet season at London's Albert Hall has been a great success after all. More than 80 per cent of the seats have been sold and promoter Derek Block and Bolshoi director Yury Grigorovich stand to pocket a Pounds 1m plus profit. The Albert Hall's new commercially-minded management is also happy - even though it decided to minimise its risk by renting the hall out for a fixed amount rather than a share of the take. It has proved to the world that the Hall doesn't just have to rely on the BBC proms for big commercial successes. The only possible grumblers are the 300 debenture holders who control close to a third of the 5,200 seats. They sacrificed a chance to watch 34 of the 37 Bolshoi performances so that their seats could be sold to the public. The consolation is that if the Albert Hall continues to make surpluses, which, as a charity, must be ploughed back into improving the venue, it does raise the value of the debentures. They rarely appear on the market but the last box to be sold three years ago changed hands for Pounds 320,000, a good return on the original, 1871, investment of Pounds 25 a seat.</p>

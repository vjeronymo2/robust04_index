			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Yun Pyong-son: "Provoker's Unreasonable </F> Faultfinding"]    [Text] Today the world' public opinion highly appraises  our decision to withdraw from the International Atomic Energy  Agency [IAEA] as a just self-defense measure and as a courageous  decision that only the DPRK can make.    Nevertheless, the South Korean puppets are arguing with us,  taking a displeased attitude toward our decision. In other  words, in a meeting with former U.S. President Carter on 14  June, traitor Kim Yong-sam clamored that our withdrawal from the  IAEA is an abnormal act, a challenge to the demands of the  international community, and the like and babbled again about  the inevitability of UN sanctions against the North. This is  indeed a provoker's unreasonable faultfinding.    Although the puppets are clamoring about an abnormal act, a  challenge, and the like, as a matter of fact, it is precisely  the agency's Secretariat, which has followed the U.S.  imperialists' plot to crush our Republic, who thrust us out of  the agency.    As is known, since we joined the Nuclear Nonproliferation  Treaty [NPT] and concluded a safeguards agreement, we have  sincerely received inspections pursuant to it. However, giving  up its mission and function as an international organization,  the agency's Secretariat adopted a resolution regarding a  special inspection of our military facilities by intentionally  fabricating inconsistence [uidojoguro purilchirul manduro naeso].    Even after we temporarily suspended the effectuation of the  declared withdrawal from the NPT, in an effort for a peaceful  solution to the nuclear issue, the agency's Secretariat forced  us to accept inspections equivalent to regular and nonregular  inspections, not inspections to guarantee the continuity of  safeguards. Hurriedly jumping at the distorted conclusion that  it has become impossible to measure the fuel rods taken this  time from the experimental reactor, the agency's Secretariat  went so far as to adopt an unreasonable resolution of suspending  the agency's coordination while demanding a special inspection  of our military facilities. The agency Secretariat's arrogant  and insolent maneuvers can be seen in this fact alone.    Thus, as we received the agency's inspections and as we  showed sincerity and generosity, some quarters of the agency's  Secretariat further intensified its pressure upon us, thereby  escalating its maneuvers of crushing the Republic.    Under such circumstances, how can our Republic, which  regards  independence as its life, tolerate the agency's unwarranted  acts? How can it idly look at the nation's dignity and  sovereignty being trampled underfoot?    As clearly indicated in the statement, our withdrawal from  the IAEA is because the agency perpetrated an act of gravely  infringing upon our Republic's dignity and sovereignty.    Fair public opinion of the world says that the  responsibility  for North Korea's withdrawal from the IAEA lies in this agency  itself. Our decision taken this time is a just self-defending  measure to defend our dignity and sovereignty. The  responsibility for our withdrawal from the IAEA lies also in the  South Korean puppets. The puppets, who have been frantic in  crushing us in collusion with the United States and some  quarters of the IAEA Secretariat, are presumptuously talking  about abnormal, challenge, and the like. This is indeed a  shameless act.    With no sophistry can the puppets escape their criminal  responsibility for having driven the situation to this point.    At a press conference on 14 June, the puppets clamored that  if the North fails to change its attitude the UN Security  Council will take a stern measure. This reveals once again their  insidious attempt to isolate and crush us.    UN sanctions are synonymous with a declaration of war  against  us. Therefore, the puppets' clamoring about the inevitability of  UN sanctions is nothing but preaching of the inevitability of a  declaration of war.    The Kim Yong-sam ring is a ring of intolerable national  traitors who are not interested in national destiny and who stop  at nothing to do harm to fellow countrymen. The Kim Yong-sam  ring will not go unpunished. If the Kim Yong-sam ring thinks  that it can survive by doing harm to fellow countrymen, this is  a foolish delusion. The puppets should not run wild like a mad  dog.</p>

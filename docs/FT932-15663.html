			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: EZTs shunned ENTERPRISE Zone Trusts turned into the twilight zone last year. Only Pounds 43.2m was invested in them in 1992-93, compared with more than Pounds 160m in 1991-92. This may seem strange, as the tax relief on EZTs is generous - you are entitled to relief at your top marginal rate of tax, without any upper limit, on investments in enterprise zone property. Tax relief is available on loans taken out to fund the property, and rental income is also tax-free. However, commercial property is inflexible and presently ravaged by a slump in prices. The tax rules governing EZs are tortuous. These factors have forced down the demand for EZTs. According to Ian Pugh, of the Allenbridge Group, unresolved issues also dented confidence. Problems interpreting the rules for apportioning a value for the land on which the property is built, on which tax relief is not available, forced many trusts to wait as long as a year before the value of their tax relief was known. The Concept Regional Portfolio trust, sponsored by the solicitors Neill Clerk, fell foul of an Inland Revenue attack on the rental income stream it has arranged for investors to receive while the properties are being built. Negotiations are continuing, but investors meanwhile soldier on without their tax relief. Hardly surprising: the Revenue can only be expected to be indignant about paying tax relief on an income derived from a building which has yet to be built. However, investors should not rule out EZTs altogether, particularly as the BES is to be phased out at the end of the year. Some trusts had a solid structure, offered good value, and sold out quickly this year even without the benefit of publicity. But investors must also have learnt that this is a dangerous market. Opportunities exist, but nobody should try to take them without taking professional advice.</p>

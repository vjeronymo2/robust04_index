			<p>BFN     [Text] Riga, Apr 29, BNS -- Presidents Boris Yeltsin of  Russia and Guntis Ulmanis of Latvia will sign an agreement  Saturday [30 April] on the withdrawal of 12,000 Russian troops  from the Baltic country by Aug. 31.    The Latvian president will be accompanied on the visit to  Moscow by Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs and other officials.    The key to the accord was an agreement this week by  negotiators in Jurmala, Latvia, on the issue of social  guarantees for 20,000 retired Russian servicemen living in  Latvia.    A special protocol on the military pensioners will be  attached to the main withdrawal package, chief Russian  negotiator Sergei Zotov said Friday.    According to Russian and Latvian officials, the protocol  says  both sides will help servicemen who want to leave Latvia, and  will set up a special fund to assist them.    "This document removed the last objections which the Latvian  side had regarding the whole package. Therefore, the road was  cleared for the visit of Latvia's president to Moscow," Zotov  told the Interfax news agency.    Officials in Moscow and Riga confirmed that Ulmanis will  sign  the entire package -- the main agreement, three related accords  and the Jurmala protocol -- in the Russian capital.    The accords would include one on social guarantees for the  Russian military for the period until the final withdrawal of  the troops, a rent agreement for the Skrunda radar station that  Russia is going to keep under its control during the next 4+1.5  years, and an accord on social guarantees for the retired  servicemen.    Latvian chief negotiator Aivars Vovers declined to elaborate  on the concessions his country had made to reach a consensus  with Russia. He said it would be difficult to properly  understand the nuances without reading the whole text of the  agreements.    Ulmanis' political adviser John Eichmanis said the amount of  rent that Russia will pay for the Skrunda base was the last  issue that remained outstanding.    "We expect it to be settled in Moscow," he told The  Associated Press. But Eichmanis expressed doubt whether the  withdrawal package would be raftified by Russia's State Duma,  the lower house of parliament, which has a large percentage of  Communists and nationalists, or the equally nationalist Latvian  parliament.    Latvian chief negotiator Aivars Vovers said the issue of the  amount of rent to be paid by Russia for the Skrunda station was  to be settled before the meeting of the presidents in Moscow.    The leader of the Russian delegation, Sergei Zotov called  the  latest negotiations a waste of time that Latvia had forced upon  Russia. He accused Latvia for lacking flexibility since the  very beginning of the talks, despite what, he added, an  agreement was reached.    The Russian Ambassador to Latvia, Alexander Rannihk, in a  conversation with the Latvian president said that a number of  foreign countries had indicated Moscow would be held responsible  if the talks with Latvia ended without an agreement. Moscow  officials also say it is possible that the presidents on  Saturday will sign only the main agreements and that the rest of  the documents would be signed by the prime ministers in the  presence of the heads of state. Yeltsin has said he is ready to  sign all four documents in the package.    About 130,000 former Soviet soldiers have pulled out of  Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia since the Baltics' regaining of  their independence in 1991. None are left in Lithuania, but  about 12,000 remain in Latvia and 2,300 in Estonia. After  Latvia has signed the accords on Saturday, Estonia will be the  only Baltic country not to have reached an agreement with Russia  on troop withdrawal.</p>

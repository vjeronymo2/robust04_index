			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 3 (XINHUA) -- Fifteen years ago,  intellectual property rights protection was virtually  non-existent in China.    But now, China has been turned into one of the "advanced"  countries in the developing world in this respect, said Arpad  Bogsch, director-general of the World Intellectual Property  Organization (WIPO).    "The change is from nothing to everything," he said. "The  whole world admires what China has achieved in a very short  time."    For the past 15 years, Bogsch has been here almost every  year. He advised China on the drafting and revision of its laws  on intellectual property rights protection and witnessed nearly  every progress China has made in this area.    This time, Bogsch came to host a WIPO-China sub-regional  symposium on the role of copyright in cultural and economic  development, which was held in Kunming, capital of south-west  China's Yunnan Province.    Despite a tight schedule, he gave XINHUA an interview before  his departure.    He recalled that when he first visited China in 1979, there  was only a "very weak" trade mark law here. In the past 15  years, China made great strides in the build-up of a legal  framework for intellectual property, while engaged in the  development of its economy.    In 1983, a revised trade mark law became effective, which  was  followed by a patent law two years later. In 1991, the  copyright law and regulations on the protection of computer  software were promulgated and implemented.    In nine years, the patent system has become a "strong and  viable system" and patents are getting more and more attention  as well as protection, he said.    Chinese inventors more and more realize that it is in their  interests and in the interests of their enterprises,  universities and scientific research institutions to have an  invention patented, Bogsch noted.    Although the copyright law is relatively young, the national  copyright administration has begun its work effectively, setting  up various agencies inside the country and organizing royalties  collection and distribution among authors, he said.    In the meantime, China joined the Paris Convention for the  Protection of Industrial Property, WIPO, the Madrid Agreement  Concerning the International Registration of Marks, the Berne  Convention for the Protection of Copyright. From January 1 of  this year, China has become a member of the Patent Cooperation  Treaty.    Therefore, China has completed the participation in  international intellectual property agreements, he said. It has  become a party to the international contacts in the field of  industrial property and copyright, participating now in the  formation of the future international relations in this field,  he added.    Bogsch noted that protecting industrial property and  copyright is to protect inventors' and producers' interests, and  encourage them to create and produce more and better cultural  and material goods.    "National creativity must be rewarded and encouraged," he  stressed.    In order to effectively protect intellectual property, a  country must, first of all, have good laws, which will have  fines or sanctions against non-compliance, he said.    In this respect, China is one of "the advanced countries" in  the developing world, he said.    Secondly, the public awareness of the usefulness of  copyright  protection must be raised, he said. Yet, to his disappointment,  people in many countries do not seem to have realized the  significance of copyright.    The presence at the Kunming symposium of over 100 Chinese  participants from the country's 31 provinces, municipalities and  autonomous regions shows once more the importance China attaches  to the improvement of its copyright protection system and to the  role of copyright in its cultural and economic development, he  noted.    "China will have as good a copyright system as any country  in  a few years," he said.    Touching on WIPO-China ties in the past 20 years, he said  the  cooperation was "excellent" and that WIPO advised China and  helped it in the training of staff.    On future cooperation, Bogsch noted that WIPO will continue  to give training to more Chinese nationals and give advice, if  requested, on how to improve and adapt new circumstances in  industrial and copyright laws.</p>

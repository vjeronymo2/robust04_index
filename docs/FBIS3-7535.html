Currently  the quotas imposed under the MFA are managed by exporting  countries so that any financial gains -- what economists call  "quota rent"-- are retained in the exporting countries.    In Thailand, the Commerce Ministry is responsible for  allocating textile export quotas, and some of these are traded  among Thai exporters. According to experts who have examined  the US proposal to open bids for allocating textile quotas to  importers, only exporting countries are eligible to sell quota  rights. That would violate both MFA and GATT rules.    Washington announced the bidding in order to compensate for  the US$13.9 billion loss of revenue expected in the next five  years resulting from tariff cuts under the Uruguay Round of the  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.    US Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said the cuts would  benefit Americans since they would reduce prices. The  government's income would rise $3 for each dollar lost from  tariff cuts.    In another development, the Thai Commercial Counsellor in  Washington said that the US Senate had enacted the Fair Trade in  Financial Services bill, which will increase US leaders'  authority in trade negotiations on financial market access for  commercial banks, insurance firms and other financial  institutions.    The act allows the US Treasury to list countries that refuse  to open financial markets to American companies.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Sergey Spitsin] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 28 TASS -- The forthcoming visit to  Russia by the Indian Prime Minister R.V. Narasimha Rao,  scheduled on June 29-July 2, will be an important landmark in  the development of traditionally friendly relations between the  people of the two great states, said the Indian ambassador to  Russia, Ronendra Sen, in an interview with ITAR-TASS on Monday.  The ambassador noted that the importance of the visit is  manifested by the fact that during the Indian prime minister's  visit two political documents will be signed devoted to a broad  range of problems of cooperation between Russia and India in the  international arena and reflecting mutual interests of the two  countries.    The ambassador pointed out that favourable prospects for  mutually advantageous bilateral cooperation will be outlined in  a package of agreements pertaining to such important spheres as  economy and defence, science and engineering, exploration of  space and environmental protection. The ambassador said that at  present, Russia and India are witnessing the process of  successful restructuring of their relations, which began as a  result of the visit to India by the Russian President Boris  Yeltsin in January, 1993. The ambassador pointed out that he  was convinced that Narasimha Rao's visit to Russia would render  a new meaning to this process.    As for bilateral cooperation in the military sphere, it  develops in the framework of an agreement signed by the Russian  Defence Minister Pavel Grachev during the Russian president's  visit to Delhi at the beginning of last year. The total sum of  contracts signed in this field exceeds 500 million dollars, the  Indian ambassador said.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many commenters from small institutions criticized the presumption  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the December proposal that a 60% loan-to-deposit ratio was reasonable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These commenters pointed out that economic conditions, institutional capacity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and other constraints may result in loan-to-deposit ratios significantly below this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> figure. Although the agencies did not intend the December proposal to suggest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that a loan-to-deposit ratio below 60% would have been presumed less than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasonable, the agencies have eliminated the use of any fixed percentage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Instead, the revised proposal would require that an institution's loan to deposit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ratio, adjusted for seasonal variation and, as appropriate, other lending related  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities, must be reasonable given the institution's size, financial condition,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the credit needs of its service area. The adjustment for lending related  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities, such as secondary market sales and community development lending  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and investment, is new in the revised proposal. This provision responds to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerns that institutions that package and sell their loans would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disadvantaged, compared to portfolio lenders, by a strict loan-to-deposit ratio  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> test. The proposed adjustment also addresses concerns raised by commenters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the small institution assessment method in the December proposal would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have ignored the community development lending performance of small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many industry commenters also criticized the requirement in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> December proposal that, to be presumed to be performing satisfactorily, an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution would have needed a good loan mix, which would have included  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> offering, to the extent permitted by law, a variety of loans to customers across  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> economic levels. These commenters were concerned that an institution would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have been required to offer all permissible loan products to all customers. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies agree that the focus on the types of products offered was inconsistent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the tenor of the proposed regulation as a whole and have altered the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criterion in the revised proposal to eliminate any requirement concerning the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> types of products that an institution offers. The revised proposal would retain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the aspect of the criterion focussing on lending to customers across economic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> levels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In a related change, the revised proposal would broaden the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criterion in the December proposal concerning the distribution of loans by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions required to report loan data under HMDA. The revised proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would explicitly provide that the agencies would consider the geographic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distribution of loans of all small institutions, not just these subject to HMDA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agencies believe this consideration was implicit in the December proposal,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which required lending across economic levels. In any event, the agencies do  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not intend this change to result in any increased documentation burden on small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions. The geographic analysis would be performed by the agencies'  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> examiners and would not be required of the institutions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agencies also received comments questioning the meaning of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the criterion in the December proposal focussing on the complaint record of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> small institutions. Because of concerns by commenters that a ``legitimate, bona-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fide complaint'' was not adequately defined, the agencies have now proposed a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criterion that would focus on the institution's record of taking appropriate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action, as warranted, in response to written complaints about its CRA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many commenters expressed concern that the December proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was unclear regarding the circumstances under which a small institution could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have earned an ``outstanding'' or less than ``satisfactory'' rating. The changes in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the revised proposal clarify and conform the treatment of small banks to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement proposed for large retail institutions_that lending performance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must be ``satisfactory'' for an institution to receive an overall satisfactory rating.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the revised proposal, the agencies would consider a small institution's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> investment and service performance in order to determine whether it is eligible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for an ``outstanding'' rating. Strong investment or service performance could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> help boost a small institution's rating to the ``outstanding'' level. Poor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> investment or service performance would not lower a small institution's rating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> below ``satisfactory'' but could prevent the institution from receiving an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``outstanding'' rating. The agencies would not consider investment and service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance to offset less than ``satisfactory'' performance by a small institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the basic assessment criteria.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The revised proposal also reflects minor changes to clarify the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment of small institutions. The agencies have eliminated the criterion in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the December proposal relating to discrimination because the issue is addressed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the section on the assignment of overall ratings. In addition, consistent with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the changes in the proposal for large institutions, the discussion of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> examination procedures for small institutions with multiple service areas has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been eliminated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] President Izetbegovic has sent a letter to the UN  Security Council regarding the situation in Srebrenica.    Srebrenica, which was declared a protected zone by Security  Council Resolutions 824 and 836, had been quiet for some time.  However, the Serbian aggressor has recently started attacking  the town again and is brutally violating the obligations  contained in these resolutions.    Exploiting the changeover of two contingents of peace  forces,  Karadzic's Serbs occupied the villages of Tjeskovici, Ursici,  Jasenovo, and Podravanje on 2, 3, and 4 March. These villages  are inside the protected zone. On the night of 4-5 March, they  attacked the camp settlement in Slapovici. The settlement is  being built with the donations of the Swedish and Norwegian  Governments. In doing so, they killed and captured a fairly  large number of civilians. Approximately 1,000 people who moved  in in the finished part of the settlement were forced to flee  toward the town.    It transpires from the aforementioned facts that the Serbian  aggressor is continuing to ignore all the decisions of the  international community. On the other hand, UNPROFOR [United  Nations Protected Forces] is unable to effectively protect the  civilian population in the demilitarized zone of Srebrenica.    Esteemed sir, we beg you that the Security Council take  appropriate measures so that the units of Karadzic's Serbs  withdraw to the previous lines of the protected Srebrenica zone  and ensure firmer control of the situation on the ground so that  the refugees could at least be guaranteed elementary safety in  their settlements.</p>

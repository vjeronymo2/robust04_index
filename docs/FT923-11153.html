			<p>920727 FT  27 JUL 92 / The Week Ahead: Diary Dates RESULTS DUE Imperial Chemical Industries reports its second-quarter results on Thursday, when it is expected to produce pre-tax profits of Pounds 200m-Pounds 240m, down from Pounds 309m for the same quarter last year. One analyst said that a cut in the dividend would have a cataclysmic effect on the market. Results on the pharmaceuticals side will be watched closely. Analysts are keen to quantify the fall in Tenormin sales in the US since the expiry of its patents. The extent to which the new drugs, Zestril, Zoladex and Diprivan, have made up Tenormin's decline will also be of interest. Otherwise, agrochemicals are likely to be disappointing, and analysts will be watching the state of the basic chemicals market to see if there has been any sign of an upturn. The chairman's statement about future prospects will be closely examined. Midland Bank becomes the first of the Big Four banks to announce its half-year results on Thursday. The results are largely of historical interest since Midland was taken over last month by Hongkong and Shanghai Bank and will not pay a dividend to its former shareholders. Last time round a poor performance on its UK banking operations drove Midland into a loss of Pounds 71m. This year it should be back in the black. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew are predicting pre-tax profits of Pounds 120m, but a possible write-back of sovereign debt could make the figure even higher. Lloyds Bank will report on Friday interim pre-tax profits of around Pounds 355m against Pounds 331m a year earlier. It is likely to increase its interim dividend by about 15 per cent to 6.29 net. The result will underline its performance as the best of the clearing banks. DIVIDEND &amp; INTEREST PAYMENTS TODAY Acatos &amp; Hutcheson 2.5p Bank of Montreal Fltg.

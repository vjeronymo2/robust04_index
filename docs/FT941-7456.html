			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / International Company News: Setback for United Air buy-out scheme United Airlines, the biggest US carrier, yesterday received a setback to its proposed employee buy-out when the labour union representing 18,000 flight attendants said it would not take part in the scheme. However, United has already won agreement from its other 63,000 union and non-union employees. It is expected to proceed with plans to put the scheme before shareholders in May or June, with a strong recommendation for approval. Under the scheme, drawn up in December by United Airline's management and the pilots' and machinists' unions, employees are due to receive a 53 per cent controlling stake in the airline in return for Dollars 5bn worth of wage cuts and other labour concessions over the next six years. The Association of Flight Attendants was not a party to the agreement because it walked out of talks earlier in the year. The protest was over suggestions that some attendants could be replaced by cheaper, foreign-based staff. Yesterday, the association said it believed agreement could be reached on United's plan to set up a low-cost airline-within-an-airline - dubbed U2 - to handle domestic short-haul flights. However, it could not accept any agreement that did not address the issue of foreign domiciles, and what it termed 'the airline's discriminatory flight attendant weight programme' - a reference to company rules on maximum weights for cabin staff.</p>

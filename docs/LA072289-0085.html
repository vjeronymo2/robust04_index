			<p><P> July 22, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLANT OF THE WEEK: CATALPA CHILOPSIS  </P> <P> Chitalpa  </P> <P> A cross between Catalpa bignonioides and Chilopsis linearis  </P> <P> Deciduous, flowering tree, to 30 feet  </P> <P> Granted, the chitalpa is a striking tree, but the most interesting thing about  it may be its background. A cross between two native American trees, the common  catalpa and the desert willow, its roots are in the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> One of the main purposes of botanical gardens in the Soviet Union is to test  and introduce new plants for potential use in the various climates of that  country.  </P> <P> The climate of the Botanical Garden of the Uzbek Academy of Sciences in  Taschkent is not unlike the Southwestern part of the United States: It is hot  and dry, and the summers are without rain. From seeds probably obtained through  a seed exchange list, Catalpa bignonioides, popular in the East, and Chilopsis  linearis, from the Southwest, were crossed. The result, which is now called  "chitalpa," was first described in 1964 in a botanical journal in Moscow.  </P> <P> Seeds and cuttings of the chitalpa were obtained by the United States in 1977  through an international botanical exchange program under the direction of Dr.  Thomas S. Elias, now director of the Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden in  Claremont. The specimens were taken to the New York Botanical Garden, where  they were grown and, in 1982, distributed to growers and other botanical  gardens in the nation.  </P> <P> Chitalpa has "a lot of potential as a medium-size ornamental tree," Elias says,  with "the best qualities of both parents." It is drought resistant and takes  the cold to about minus 10 degrees Fahrenheit. In Southern California, it  begins to bloom in March and can go strong all the way until September. The  big, catalpa-like pale-pink flowers bloom in branched, upright clusters. The  leaves of catalpas are broad and rounded, and those of desert willows are  narrow. Chitalpa leaves are narrow and elliptical, giving the tree a light and  airy appearance.  </P> <P> Rounded in overall form and growing to about 30 feet, it tends to be  multi-trunked with low, spreading branches to 18 to 20 feet. (If left to its  own, it cannot be walked under.) Most trees available in Southern California  are trained to standard tree, or lollipop, form.  </P> <P> This is what is called an intergeneric hybrid -- hybrids are usually crossed  species, but the parents of chitalpa are from different genera (however, they  are closely related -- from the same family, Bignoniaceae). The offspring have  yet to produce fruit or seed, but the plant roots easily from cuttings.  </P> <P> One drawback to the new tree is that it can get leaf mildew as crape myrtles  do.  </P> <P> Chitalpa trees can be seen now, in bloom, at Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden,  planted in the parking lot and in the Experimental Garden. At age 6 or 7, they  are 12 to 14 feet tall, about half the size they're going to be when mature.  </P> <P> Available from local nurseries, which can order 5-gallon containers directly  from Monrovia Nursery Co. in Azusa.

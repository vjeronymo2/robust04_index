			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] It looks as if yet another armed faction has  surfaced in Liberia, this time in the southeast, where there  have been ongoing clashes between Charles Taylor's NPFL  [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] and the Liberian Peace  Council, LPC. The emergence of the new group is being linked to  insecurity on the main road into the port city of Buchanan.  From Monrovia, Nii Nartey Allison telexed this report:    Today, ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States  Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] said it had arrested four rebels it  said were responsible for an ambush last Thursday [16 June] on a  car on the Buchanan Highway. Two people were killed in the  attack and five wounded. The ECOMOG chief of operations,  Colonel Albert Lamptey, told reporters that posters and  identification papers found with the four rebels carried the  insignia of the Bassa Defense Force, BDF, a previously unknown  armed group. He said the posters called for the withdrawal of  the Nigerian contingent from ECOMOG.    ECOMOG's chief of staff, General Femi Williams [title as  heard], said the four ambush suspects were still being  investigated, and warned factions against launching ambushes on  the highway to Buchanan. Gen. Williams said rebels of Charles  Taylor's National Patriotic Front of Liberia, NPFL, have moved  into positions occupied by ECOMOG, adding: These provocations  are still continuing to force us into battle.    Meanwhile, Monrovia is still puzzled over a search operation  carried out on Monday morning by the African troops, paralyzing  the entire commercial sector of the city. General Kunle Togun  of the Nigerian contingent said the search was carried out to  uncover weapons that may have been smuggled into the city.</p>

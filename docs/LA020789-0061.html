			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THIS YEAR, SMU WILL STILL HAVE ONLY 41 SCHOLARSHIP PLAYERS  </P> <P> The National Collegiate Athletic Assn. will still be punishing Southern  Methodist next month during spring football practice.  </P> <P> Whereas other Division I-A coaches will have 95 scholarship football players on  campus, SMU Coach Forrest Gregg will have only 41.  </P> <P> And that's all he will have next fall.  </P> <P> The numbers:  </P> <P>  -- Last year, the Mustangs were allowed to sign 15 players, of whom 13 remain.  </P> <P>  -- They will get 25 more Wednesday, which is national signing day.  </P> <P>  -- There are three holdovers from 1986, when other SMU players received money  from alumni, resulting in the NCAA's so-called death penalty and leading to two  seasons without football.  </P> <P>  -- Not until well into the '90s will SMU be up to the full complement of 95  scholarship players.  </P> <P> The NCAA also has reduced the Mustang coaching staff. Gregg can have only five  assistants now. Not until June can he hire the four others to bring his staff  up to the nine-man complement allowed in Division I-A.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, Gregg will begin with three quarterbacks: Casey Clyce, Mike Romo  and sophomore walk-on Greg Ziegler, a Michigan transfer.

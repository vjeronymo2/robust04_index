			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Xavier Ventura: "CiU Deems Government's Attitude </F> Toward Tackling Corruption Positive and Firm"]    [Text] Barcelona -- The Convergence and Union (CiU)  leadership yesterday confirmed its support for the Felipe  Gonzalez government in deeming positive the measures adopted by  it in order to combat corruption. The CiU liaison committee,  which met yesterday, Monday, decided to grant the Socialist  Party a margin of confidence, after assessing that the recent  resignations of some of its members and the announced intention  expressed by the prime minister to tackle corruption show "a  positive will" to resolve this problem, now regarded as the main  threat to Spanish political stability.    To this effect, the liaison committee pointed out in its  final communique that political stability is essential for the  country's necessary economic recovery. According to the  nationalist coalition's leaders, Spain's current situation  requires clear political stability, since it is "an essential  factor for economic recovery, necessary for job creation."  Hence, CiU yesterday publicly guaranteed its support for the  Socialist government again, although some of its leaders do not  conceal their reservations about what they deem to be the  government's irretrievable public image and the excessive  slowness in tackling the corruption cases affecting the PSOE  [Spanish Socialist Workers Party].    The liaison committee meeting was chaired by Jordi Pujol on  behalf of Convergence and by Josep Antoni Duran Lleida on behalf  of Union and lasted more than two hours. Among other topics,  the recent statements by Jose Maria Aznar, who accused CiU of  "blackmailing" the government and Spain, were analyzed.  According to the coalition's leaders, the People's Party  leader's remarks fall within a campaign by the conservative  party, which is judged "destabilizing and devoid of proposals"  and which was described as "irresponsible" since it even impedes  the country's economic recovery.    CiU's support for the government was expressed directly to  Felipe Gonzalez by Pujol last Thursday at a meeting held in  Madrid between the Generalitat [Catalan autonomous government]  premier and the prime minister, shortly before the Socialist  leader's public appearance, and it has been confirmed again now,  two days before Gonzalez appears before the Congress [of  Deputies] in order to report on the situation. Yesterday, it  was Jordi Pujol again who showed the greatest desire to support  the government, since, in his opinion, Gonzalez is determined to  get to the bottom of the corruption problem.    The liaison committee also urged the government to follow  through the economic measures adopted so far, which, according  to the CiU leaders, have made possible the beginning of the  economic recovery. The danger that calling an early election --  a possibility which, moreover, is borne in mind in the medium  term -- will represent an insurmountable curb on Spain's  economic recovery was one of the arguments which CiU uses to  justify its support for the government.    The liaison committee's communique states that CiU's  political stance gives priority to the struggle against  corruption, the policy for economic recovery, and the resolute  will to implement the autonomy policy. This last-mentioned  point, which the crisis caused by the corruption scandals has  apparently overshadowed, was discussed at length yesterday,  since it is believed that progress in this field remains  decisive for the coalition's maintaining its support for the  government. When the meeting was over, the CiU leaders learned  of the statements by [former Secretary of State for the National  Plan on Drugs] Baltasar Garzon, which sources in the two parties  played down in describing them as an internal matter for the  Socialists.</p>

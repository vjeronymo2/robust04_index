			<p>BFN     [Text] President Glavkos Kliridhis has said that within the  next few days he will give the reasons that led him to tell U.S.  President Bill Clinton and British Prime Minister John Major  that he may resign and declare early elections if the UN  Security Council decides to continue the negotiations on the  confidence-building measures.    In a statement after a ceremony to receive the credentials  of  the new Portuguese ambassador, Kliridhis mentioned that he  expects Clinton and Major to reply to his letter. He added that  he has some indications of the way the two leaders will react.    Commenting on the resolution that the UN Security Council  adopted yesterday to renew the UNFICYP [UN Forces in Cyprus]  mandate, the president noted that the resolution sends out the  correct messages because it stresses the need to implement the  confidence-building measures, not to continue the talks on them.  He added it is important that a new, detailed revision of the  Cyprus issue be made according to yesterday's resolution, and  that all of the alternatives that are listed in the UN secretary  general's report be examined. The president said he does not  rule out that Butrus-Ghali's options will be simultaneously  studied with the confidence-building measures procedure if  Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas accepts the 21 March UN  document.</p>

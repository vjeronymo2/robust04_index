In-kind services or other contributions supporting each activity will also be identified and will be assigned a dollar value.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Landlord Outreach Log. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  HUD and the Congress have expressed an interest in learning about the level of landlord outreach that occurs through the program. It is the NPO's responsibility to recruit landlords to participate in the MTO program, particularly owners and managers of more than 500 units and those with large (3+ bedrooms) units. The log allows the NPO to keep a record of the names and addresses of landlords who are contacted, the types and location of units under their management, and the landlord's interest in participating in the program. Similarly, it provides a place to record contacts with property owner associations. The Landlord Outreach Logs are updated by the NPOs as necessary. Updated logs will be copied and sent to HUD at the end of each month for the intake period of the MTO demonstration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A2.3&blank;Research Objectives and Analysis Design  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The research objectives for the demonstration derive largely from the authorizing legislation, the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992. In the short term, the primary objective is to test whether the MTO program can lead to significantly more leasing in low-poverty areas than would have occurred if standard Section 8 procedures were employed. To do so, it is necessary to obtain evidence of the effects and costs of adding MTO housing search assistance services to the Section 8 rental assistance program. As noted above, information must be collected about standard Section 8 practices, which may vary considerably from site to site, and their associated costs at each of the demonstration sites. In addition, information must be collected about the rate at which participants are able to move to low-poverty areas, the level of special housing counseling provided by NPOs to assist these moves, as well as other program activities (i.e, landlord outreach) that facilitate movement to low-poverty areas. Through the agency data collection and the Contractor's monitoring and technical assistance activities, data will be provided to HUD that will enable a full account of the costs involved in adding search assistance to the Section 8 program and the number of families who were able to move to low-poverty areas as a result of this assistance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the long term, the primary research objective of the MTO demonstration is to determine whether MTO placements have measurable impacts on the lives and opportunities of the families selected for the experimental group. A mandated report to Congress in 2004 will address the long-term effects of the demonstration. HUD has determined that the key methodological strategy for measuring long-term effects is through three-way random assignment of MTO program participants at the time of entry into the program, permitting a comparison of experimental and control group subjects for the final evaluation report. Experimental group participants will receive Section 8 assistance to move to low-poverty areas, as well as special housing search and counseling assistance provided by NPOs at each of the demonstration sites. One control group of participants will receive the Section 8 assistance along with the standard Section 8 briefing and support provided by the PHAs. A second control group will receive no assistance under the MTO program but will retain current public housing or Section 8 project-based housing. All three groups will be tracked by HUD for a period of ten years, through any moves or changes in assistance status that may occur.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The analysis design for the long-term evaluation is under development by HUD and an outside experts group, which has been convened twice (in December 1993 and March 1994). <FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>  To date, the group has focused its attention primarily on the experimental design (confirming the choice of three-way random assignment) and on the development of the baseline survey described in the previous section. Presumably, analysis plans and other data collection instruments (such as household follow-up surveys) will be needed to analyze the long-term impacts of MTO. The Department intends to pursue these through the work of the experts' group and through later procurements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 13 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The list of experts is found in Exhibit A.1 below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> A3&blank;Use of Improved Technologies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The potential for using improved information technology to reduce burden in this study has been reviewed.

			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / EC cash windfall likely, MPs told STERLING'S devaluation since September should mean a windfall gain for the UK from the European Community budget, a House of Commons committee heard yesterday. Mr David Bostock, head of the UK Treasury's European Community group, told the Treasury and Civil Service committee there should be an increase in sterling receipts from the EC budget, especially for Britain's farmers. There is unlikely to be any significant change to Britain's contributions to the EC, however. This is because any increase in the sterling cost of the EC budget arising from the devaluation should be offset by declines in the measures of gross national product and value added tax on which contributions are partly based. UK farmers will be paid more in sterling because agricultural support prices are denominated in 'green Ecu', which are roughly equivalent in value to the D-mark, Mr Bostock said. Britain's receipts from the EC structural funds, which are denominated in European currency units, will also be worth more when expressed in sterling. Sir John Cope, the paymaster general, told the committee the government would be 'bidding strongly' to increase the areas of the UK that qualify for financial support through the structural funds because of the fall in GNP during the recession. He said it was unlikely, however, that the UK would qualify for payments from the so-called cohesion funds that have been created to aid Spain, Portugal, Greece and Ireland. These countries, the four poorest EC members, will receive the payments to help them prepare for economic and monetary union.</p>

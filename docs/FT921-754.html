			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Ban on foreigners buying NTT stock to be lifted JAPAN plans to lift its ban on foreigners buying stock in Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT), the nation's telecommunications giant, AP-DJ reports from Tokyo. Today, the cabinet is set to approve a bill allowing foreign holdings totalling up to 20 per cent of the 15.6m shares in Japan's largest company, the Post and Telecommunications Ministry said yesterday. NTT's shares reached a price of more than Y3m each in mid-1987, soon after the company was converted from a government monopoly to a private corporation, but closed yesterday at 640,000 yen. Since the group's privatisation Tokyo stocks have fallen, NTT has been hit by a bribery scandal and investors' interest in the telecommunications sector has fallen. Mr Masakazu Oyama, a dealer at Daiwa Securities, said the stock's unpopularity in Japan left NTT with no choice but to target foreign invest-ors.</p>

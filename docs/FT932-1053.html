			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / The Nadir Affair: Lengthy saga undermines PM's authority THE AFFAIR of Mr Michael Mates was more than a boil that had to be lanced. There was a broader subtext about Mr John Major's style of government and his control of his increasingly fractious party. The resignation of the Northern Ireland minister leaves Mr Major weakened - not because of the importance of Mr Mates, but because of the impression of indecision that has pervaded around Downing Street. The majority view among Conservative MPs was that the embarrasment and damaging uncertainty might have been avoided if the prime minister had made clear earlier and beyond doubt whether he believed Mr Mates should go or stay. There was regret that the lessons of the build up to Mr David Mellor's resignation as Heritage Secretary last September had apparently not been learnt. For the past week Downing Street has repeatedly maintained that the Northern Ireland minister was not guilty of a significant misdemeanour. But when Mr Mates, with considerable political gumption, said he enjoyed the 'full confidence' of the prime minister, Downing Street refused to endorse his words. Little effort was made to stop reports of Mr Major happily leaving the final verdict to the last night's meeting of the 1922 Committee of backbench MPs. Most Tory MPs were sure that Mr Mates's resignation was inevitable. In the event, Mr Mates resigned four hours before the meeting started. Last night some Tory MPs were prepared to attack the media for trying to dictate the composition of Mr Major's administration. The prime minister did not join them. 'Assault. I see no assault,' he replied to one such Tory. He perhaps accepted that much of the blame for Mr Mates's downfall, and the fall-out on the Tory party, lay at his door.</p>

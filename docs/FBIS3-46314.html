			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Hidetoshi Kaneko] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 25 Dec -- On 25 December, a high-ranking  official of the Chinese Foreign Ministry expressed the hope that  Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa would visit China at  an early date. Speaking about how the Sino-Japanese  relationship would develop in 1994, the official said: "We hope  Prime Minister Hosokawa can visit China as early as possible  next year."    He described a visit by Hosokawa to the PRC as "important  for  China." However, considering the current fluid political  situation in Japan, he added that the prime minister could visit  here "at any time that is convenience to him."    His remarks expressed the hope that Hosokawa would make a  visit, even if only short, whenever he found time during the  Diet session.    Touching on the subject of Japan's bid for a permanent seat  on the United Nations Security Council [UNSC], he said: "In  principle, China also supports the idea of expanding and  reforming the structure of the UNSC when time is ripe."  However, he reiterated China's cautious stance, saying: "It is  necessary to listen to the opinions of member nations to form a  consensus."    The official expressed opposition to a view supported by  some  members of the Japanese ruling coalition that Japan should start  government-level exchanges with Taiwan.    He said: "Naturally, China is interested in moves in Japan  to send its ministers to Taiwan." He called on Tokyo to stick  to its policy of normalizing relations with China while limiting  exchanges with Taiwan to those at the private level.    The official also commented on the proposal to establish a  council of representatives from the Chinese National Defense  Ministry and the Japanese Defense Ministry which would be a  separate body from the security council formed by the foreign  ministries of each country.    He said: "I agree to promote dialogue between the defense  authorities."    He also made a point about the Sino-Japanese security  council.    "Although Japan calls it the security council, China refers  to the dialogue on regional security between the foreign  ministries, so other countries will not mistake for a forum  similar to the Japanese-U.S. security committee."    His remark indicated there is a slight difference between  Tokyo and Beijing in their views on the nature of the council.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The head of state's press secretariat has stated  that Head of State Eduard Shevardnadze today met Mr. Bosham, an  adviser from the European Union. The conversation centered on  the complex situation of the Georgian economy and solutions to  this problem.    The head of state mentioned that the situation in Georgia is  so grave that a specific social solution has to be found. There  are acute problems in power engineering and grain supplies;  inflation is rising. Therefore, regulating solely the tax  system will not resolve all the problems provided the rest of  the issues are settled, to which end the efforts of the supreme  authorities are directed [sentence as heard].    Mr. Boshman agreed with the head of state and said that it  is time realistic actions are carried out in order to get out of  the situation, all the more when east European countries have  had an experience of it.</p>

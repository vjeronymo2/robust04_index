			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / International Company News: Wang shows small profit after leaving Chapter 11 WANG, the former minicomputer manufacturer, made a small profit in its first quarter since emerging from the protection of the US bankruptcy code. Now reconstructed as a computer software and services company, it yesterday reported income before tax, extraordinary items and reorganisation expenses of Dollars 12.3m compared with a Dollars 36.9m loss for the same quarter in 1992. The company said operating income of Dollars 12.4m for the first quarter included about Dollars 5m in non-recurring income from settlements under technology licensing agreements. There was an extraordinary gain on debt discharge, net of reorganisation expenses, of Dollars 294.4m, giving a net income for the quarter of Dollars 306.3m. But Wang said net income for the quarter was neither comparable with prior quarters nor indicative of future results. Revenues were Dollars 210.9m, compared with Dollars 360m a year ago. No dividend is being paid. Mr Joseph Tucci, newly appointed chairman, said the results represented a 'solid return to profitability'. They also showed the company could achieve sustained profitability as a supplier of office productivity software based on open standards and client-server designs. Wang was placed in bankruptcy protection last year with debts of more than Dollars 500,000. It emerged from Chapter 11 three weeks ago after its creditors agreed to a debt-to-equity conversion. No single stockholder owns more than a few per cent of the company, and the balance sheet is strong. The company will continue to support users of its VS series of minicomputers, but its new business plan focuses on client-server software and systems integration services.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moldovan President Mircea Snegur signed a decree  saying that a referendum on confirmation of the republic's  independence be held with the participation of all Moldova's  inhabitants on Friday. The referendum is to take place on March  6.    Voters will be required to answer a single question: "Do you  support that the Republic of Moldova develop as an independent  and integral state within the borders recognized by the UN,  pursue the policy of neutrality and maintain mutually beneficial  economic relations with any state and that equal human rights be  guaranteed to all citizens in accordance with principles of  international law?"    The Central Election Commission on parliamentary elections  rejected the president's proposal that the referendum be held  together with the parliamentary elections on February 27.  However, the president acted in conformity with the current  legislature and assumed the responsibility for holding of the  sociological poll.    According to observers in Kishinev, the Moldovan president's  decision on the referendum was aimed at discouraging those who  support the idea of unification between Moldova and Romania.</p>

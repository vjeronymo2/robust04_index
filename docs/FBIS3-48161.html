			<p>Language: <F P=105> Vietnamese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Continuation of Part Two" of the Communist Party of </F> Vietnam Seventh Central Committee's political report delivered  by General Secretary Do Muoi at the opening of the Mid-Term  National Party Conference at the Ba Dinh Conference Hall in  Hanoi on 20 January -- read by announcer]    [Text] We must strive to consistently implement the policy  on developing the multisectoral economy and give various  economic components and business establishments more headway to  develop quickly and attain strong economic results. Efforts  must be made to strengthen and improve state-run business  establishments to help them effectively carry out their  activities so as to take an active role in the economy. This is  a very important and urgent task because it will help to  encourage and support other economic sectors in their  development while accelerating rapid and long-lasting economic  growth. It is an apparatus with material strength that will  help the state to regulate and lead the market economy to  develop further in accordance with the socialist orientations.    It is necessary for us to be able to distinguish the nature  of state ownership from that of state-run business. We must  realize that assets and capital belonging to the state are used  in various forms to ensure strong socioeconomic results and to  enhance the state capability in accelerating and controlling  economic activities. Investment in state-run business should  include enterprises set up with a 100-percent state capital and  those with the majority shares held by the state so as to allow  the state to effectively control these establishments.    Efforts must be made to allocate land and forest areas to  the  people on a long-term basis, to give leases or provide  concessions for exploiting mineral mines, to enter into joint  business ventures, and to buy shares from enterprises of other  sectors. We must integrate efforts to strengthen state-run  business in various sectors, areas, and socioeconomic  infrastructure projects; in the financial, banking, and  insurance establishments; and in a number of key production and  service units so as to help the national economy develop  strongly. It is necessary to encourage other economic components  to participate in these tasks in different forms and degrees.    In carrying out these tasks, we can reduce the number of  inessential state-run business establishments while  consolidating, expanding, and building new essential state-run  enterprises. We must strive to strengthen and develop state-run  business in agriculture, forestry, and fishery in the direction  of joining and cooperating with other business branches to build  industrial and service centers -- especially for the processing  industry -- scientific-technological centers, and cultural and  social centers in localities throughout the country.    We must strive to strengthen and improve the state-run trade  system, to firmly control the export-import business and trading  of essential materials, to regulate the wholesale and retail  trades, and together with other sectors to stabilize and develop  the local markets. Efforts must be made to ensure a smooth  transportation of goods, to serve and accelerate production  development, to protect the interest of producers and consumers,  and to make fundamental changes in the organization and  management mechanism of state-run business in order to ensure  the autonomous operation of business establishments in the  market economic system while ensuring effective control by the  state.    The fundamental factors leading to ineffective operations,  negative practices, and waste at many state-run business  establishments are due to the fact that we do not have certain  people who act as direct owners of state assets and who take  responsibility for and protect the interests of state  properties. We have no attractive and firm motives to encourage  personnel and workers at various state-run enterprises to devote  their energies to the development of their establishments. We  still lack the material and organizational strength to  decisively define various working methods of curbing corruption  and acts which cause losses to public properties. We must find  ways of overcoming these shortcomings.    To attract more capital, create a driving force to curb  negativism, and accelerate the profitability of state-run  business, we must introduce various forms of shareholding  enterprises in line with our production and business system, and  with the majority shares held by the state. We must step by  step apply the method of selling shares to personnel and workers  who work at enterprises. Efforts must be made to distribute  profits to personnel and workers, based on their base salary and  the numbers of their shares. We should conduct a pilot project  to sell a number of shares of state-run business establishments  to private organizations and individuals.    On the introduction of a share holding enterprise system,  we will stipulate the organization of management boards  comprising representatives of state shareholders, workers  shareholders, and other shareholders. Regulations and selection  criteria to help management boards select managing directors  should be set up. Work contracts in various forms with workers  should be applied in a widespread manner and be perfected  continuously within state enterprises. The state will support  and encourage the implementation, in accordance with the  development needs of the economy, and renovation of enterprise  unions and general corporations into the organization of  business conglomerates, thus avoiding intermediary  administrative authorities. The system of managing ministries,  managing administration authorities, and the distinction between  centrally-managed enterprises and locally- managed enterprises  will be gradually discarded.    State authorities at all levels and sectors should take care  of and assist state enterprises in their businesses, especially  in matters relating to capital, technology, marketing, and cadre  training and deployment. For enterprises which serve  socioeconomic public benefits which suffer low income or loss,  the state will have a reasonable relief policy which discourages  reliability. The state will have clear regulations on the  state's inspection authority and stop the inspection and control  work in an ad hoc style which is inconvenient to the businesses.  For state enterprises doing business in non-essential areas who  suffer extended losses and lack the capacity to overcome these  losses, the resolute measures pointed out at the second plenum  of the seventh Central Committee should be applied.    We will continue to renovate the economic establishment of  cooperatives and develop the independent role of cooperative  members. The state supports, assists, and guides the  development of all cooperative economic establishments in  various economic sectors on a voluntary and mutually beneficial  basis. Management of the cooperatives should be democratic and  encourage combining the strength of the cooperative with the  strength of each household member.    The renovation of cooperatives and other cooperative  economic  establishments should be carried out in all sectors of  agriculture, forestry, and fishery in accordance with the  resolutions of the seventh Central Committee's fifth plenum.  Strict measures will be applied in handling the sluggish  cooperatives and experimental renovation in all forms of  cooperative economic establishments in handicrafts, financial  credit, trading, and service and should be continued.  Cooperatives can function on a larger scale, performing various  branches of business and are not restricted within any  administrative boundaries. Besides the capital contributed by  members and the assets of the cooperatives, capital and labor  from outsiders should be motivated. Members of cooperatives  receive incomes which are subjected to contributed labor and  shares. Cooperatives can exercise any of the various levels of  collectivity of production supplies in accordance with business  necessity, aspirations, and benefit of the members.    The individual and small business economic sector, which  comprises mostly family business establishments, is speedily  growing and possesses tremendous potential to become an  important element of the economy. We must have a policy to help  this sector in terms of capital, technology, market information,  and so forth in order to help their businesses become effective,  thus creating more employment and more opportunities for  individuals to contribute to the national construction. We must  also guide and encourage individual business establishments to  gradually join cooperative economic establishments on a  voluntary basis.    The private capital economic sector, both overseas and  domestic, is growing fast and contributing positively to the  national construction. The state continues to encourage private  capital economic activities in sectors and areas allowed by law.  The state also protects legal rights and benefits of private  businessmen, joins development and investment funds with these  businessmen on the basis of consensus, and encourages them to  sell prioritized shares to their workers. The state helps and  guides them to overcome difficulties and do business in  accordance with state laws and regulations. Concrete  regulations will be promulgated to stipulate the state  management role towards business establishments with capital  invested directly by outsiders.    In combination with inspection and control functions of the  state, we need to develop the grassroots organizations of the  party, trade unions, and politico-social mass organizations  within the private business enterprises and joint business  enterprises either domestically or with overseas partners.  These grassroots organizations will contribute to productivity,  protect legal benefits of workers, and prevent illegal deeds.  We should create conditions and a legal environment for lawful  competition activities and for developing collective businesses  on a voluntary and mutually beneficial basis, regardless of the  disparity between these businesses in a sector or locality.    Using the major state enterprises as the bases, we will form  business corporations with a significant ability to compete in  the domestic as well as international markets.</p>

Yeltsin's visit to Tbilisi and the forthcoming  signing of the treaty between Georgia and Russia have become the  subject of discussion at the meeting in the Foreign Ministry  between A. Kozyrev and leaders of the North Caucasus republics.  They expressed their critical attitude toward the draft treaty.  Meeting with some of the participants in the meeting, our  correspondent asked them to explain their position.    Akhsarbek Galazov, president of the Republic of North  Ossetia:    "I believe that Russia should not sign any treaty with  Georgia until there is a political settlement of the problem of  Abkhazia and South Ossetia. If a treaty is signed clearly  determining the fate of these two republics and they finally  receive a political settlement of their problems -- I am wholly  in favor.    "I believe that South Ossetia should be recognized as a  republic and that through the joint efforts of Georgia and  Russia an economic basis should be placed under that decision,  that the regions which were in fact seized should be returned to  South Ossetia and all refugees should return.    "Second, and that is perhaps the main thing, we are also in  favor of Georgia's integrity. But it will not be preserved as a  single state unless the Georgian people's leaders realize that  they must consider realities. After all, in fact Abkhazia and  South Ossetia are now outside Georgia. To ensure that they are  part of Georgia they must sit down with them at the conference  table, sign a treaty, and satisfy their peoples' demands to the  maximum.    "All questions existing today in the North Caucasus cannot  be  examined only within that region. The Caucasus is united and  its division into the North Caucasus and the Transcaucasus seems  to me utterly artificial. At the meeting at the Foreign  Ministry there were statements in which Georgia was called the  aggressor, with whom a treaty cannot be signed. And indeed, it  did after all in fact perpetrate aggression. Seeking to drive  non-Georgians out of South Ossetia, Georgia seized the territory  of what was then still an autonomous oblast.    "As for Abkhazia it was artificially joined to Georgia back  in Soviet times and Georgia also perpetrated aggression against  Abkhazia using the national extremists' forces. And we believe  that today Russia should not sign a wide-ranging treaty with  Georgia. The problems of Abkhazia and South Ossetia are  closely, directly linked with Russia. Nearly all the North  Caucasus republics, krays, and oblasts took part in the defense  of Abkhazia. And what happened in Abkhazia has found a response  in Adygeya, Karachayevo-Cherkesiya, Krasnodar and Stavropol  krays, and Kabardino-Balkariya....    "And surely South Ossetia's troubles cannot be viewed in  isolation from North Ossetia? Any shot in the south echoes in  North Ossetia. For the fourth year now not a single kilogram of  food, not a single tablet or tube of medicine has reached South  Ossetia from Georgia, nor have necessities been arriving. South  Ossetia is supplied via North Ossetia and is in fact maintained  by Russia. So surely Russia cannot sign a treaty until the  problems of Abkhazia and South Ossetia are settled?"    Magomedali Magomedov, chairman of the Republic of Dagestan  Supreme Soviet:    "Before discussing the draft treaty we were not familiarized  with it in advance. I believe that as a whole the treaty is  aimed at establishing normal mutual relations between Russia and  Georgia. But we are worried by the position of South Ossetia  and Abkhazia and we said that agreements with the Georgian  leadership should be reached on these issues, that is these  questions should not be bypassed when concluding a treaty".    Vladimir Khubiyev, chairman of the Karachayevo-Cherkess  Republic Council of Ministers:    "I think that reason will nonetheless triumph and a  political  solution will be found for ensuring these republics' peaceful  coexistence and the rights of each republic should be as they  are determined by the peoples themselves -- of Abkhazia, South  Ossetia, and Georgia. Now is not the time when someone can be  switched to someone else's subordination and when a big nation  can dictate its will to a small people. I know the opinion of  the Abkhazians -- both the ordinary citizens and the leaders.  They all, down to the last person, favor independence. In what  form is another question."</p>

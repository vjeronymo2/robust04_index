			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Markets Report: D-Mark rises The D-Mark recouped some of its recent losses against the other core currencies in Europe's exchange-rate mechanism and firmed markedly against the US dollar, writes Conner Middelmann. After posting sharp gains against the D-Mark, the French and Belgian francs and the Danish krone edged lower on profit-taking ahead of the weekend, during which EC and US leaders will meet in Brussels and Geneva to discuss the GATT talks. 'Given the high-level talks over the weekend, most people didn't want to risk running large positions,' said Mr Keith Edmonds, chief analyst at IBJ International. The French franc drifted lower, but did not leave its former narrow ERM band. At its lowest point of the day, it hit the floor of the former 2.25 per cent fluctuation band at FFr3.4305, but closed at FFr3.424, from FFr3.427 on Thursday. The Danish krone also eased back slightly after being boosted Thursday by fresh rate-cut hopes. It briefly pierced the floor of its former narrow ERM band at DKr3.9016 but closed at DKr3.913 against the D-Mark, after DKr3.918 on Wednesday. The Belgian franc closed at BFr20.91, unchanged from Thursday's close. Sterling slipped below DM2.45 as European traders took profits from the gains earlier in the week. It closed at DM2.5400, down from DM2.5500 on Thursday but up from its intra-day low of DM2.5357. Sterling money market conditions were tight amid seasonal pressures. 'It was a very short day at the end of a very short week,' sighed a London money market dealer, who expects the tightness to continue next week. The Bank of England initially forecast a shortage of Pounds 2.6bn, which was later revised up to Pounds 2.75bn. In early operations the Bank purchased bills totalling Pounds 1.5bn for resale to the market in equal amounts on December 29, 30 and 31 at 5 13/32 . In further operations the Bank purchased band 2 bills totalling Pounds 5m. In its afternoon operation it bought another Pounds 553m of bills and provided late assistance of around Pounds 710m. The December short sterling futures contract slipped by 0.06 point to 94.63 and the March contract eased by 0.04 point to 94.92. The dollar shed more than a pfennig against the D-Mark, breaching key technical support at DM1.6950. It slid to a low of DM1.6932 before closing in London at DM1.6990. down from DM1.7055 on Thursday. Traders said there were no strong reasons for the slippage and the extent of the move was amplified by thin trading conditions. 'Even a small hedging transaction in the bond market can trigger quite marked and often counter-intuitive moves in the currency,' said a London dealer. The dollar rose against the Yen, however, ending at Y109.15, up from Thursday's close of Y108.65. The Yen was depressed by the Bank of Japan's latest quarterly corporate survey, which painted a gloomy economic picture and kept hopes for a near-term cut in the 1.75 per cent official discount rate alive. Next week's slew of economic data from Japan and the US is expected to highlight the divergence of the two countries' economies, further underpinning the dollar against the Yen. Mr Edmonds at IBJ expects the dollar to trade at around Y110 by year-end and to rise to Y115 on a three-month view. The US sees the release next week of retail sales, industrial production, capacity utilisation, business inventories and housing starts data, while Japan is due to publish industrial production, machine orders and the November trade balance figures.</p>

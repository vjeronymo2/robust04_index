			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / International Company News: Ilva chief quits ahead of meeting MR GIOVANNI Gambardella, the chief executive of Ilva, Italy's state steel group, yesterday announced his resignation 24 hours before a special meeting called to consider losses in 1992 close to L2,000bn (Dollars 1.36bn). In a brief note, Mr Gambardella, who presided over the birth of Ilva in 1988, said he was making way for new blood having carried out a specific phase in the reorganisation of the state steel business. However, the abrupt nature of his departure was underlined by a curt statement from IRI, the state holding company that controls Ilva. The statement made no reference to his record in establishing Ilva, from the confused remains of the former state-run steel sector centred round Finsider. It merely said an interim board would operate until January 23, when a new management would be considered. The full extent of Ilva's losses in 1992 are understood to have only become known to IRI very recently. At the beginning of the year, Ilva was indicating losses would be in the region of L1,000bn to L1,300bn as a result of a depressed market, high finance costs and low prices in the international steel market. But yesterday IRI officials indicated the figure to be announced today would be close to L2,000bn. This compared with a modest L115bn profit only two years earlier. IRI stressed Ilva's restructuring plan would proceed as planned.</p>

			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SAN FRANCISCO;  </P> <P> GAYS WANT WALESA STREET RENAMED  </P> <P> Members of the gay community are urging city leaders to rename the downtown  Civic Center's Lech Walesa Street because of an anti-homosexual statement the  Polish Solidarity leader allegedly made this spring. Walesa, who won the Nobel  Peace Prize in 1982, is accused of telling delegates to an April Solidarity  union convention that he would "eliminate" homosexuals from Polish society if  he were elected president.  </P> <P> The alleged remarks caused an uproar in the city's gay community which recently  persuaded Supervisor Harry Britt, who is gay, to schedule a hearing on the  renaming proposal. Britt has contacted the Polish Embassy in an effort to get a  copy of the text of Walesa's speech. The issue will be discussed Aug. 7 by the  board's City Service Committee. Ivy Street was renamed Lech Walesa Street in  1986 in honor of the Polish union leader's battle for democracy.  </P></p>

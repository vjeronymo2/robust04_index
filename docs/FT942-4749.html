			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / French Groupe Schneider chairman released on bail An 11-night stay in a Brussels prison ended last night for one of France's best known industrialists when Mr Didier Pineau-Valencienne, chairman of Groupe Schneider, was released on bail. Mr Pineau-Valencienne left Brussel's Forest prison at 7pm after Mr Jean Claude Van Espen, the Belgian prosecuting judge in charge of the case, was satisfied that there was no longer any reason to detain him. The chairman of Schneider, one of Europe's largest electrical engineering groups, was arrested two weeks ago on charges of fraud, embezzlement and falsification of accounts. That followed an investigation prompted by complaints from minority shareholders of two Belgian subsidiaries of Schneider: Cofimines and Cofibel. Mr Valentino Foti, an Italian businessman arrested on similar charges, remained imprisoned in Brussels last night. According to his lawyer, he is unlikely to be released until the Italian authorities have completed their investigations on behalf of the Belgian prosecutors or until his appeal is heard in Belgium. Mr Pineau-Valencienne, who returned to Paris, was released on bail of BFr15m (Pounds 291,000). He was also ordered by the judge to present himself whenever required to the judicial authorities and to do nothing that might interfere with the investigation. The Belgian authorities came under intense political pressure to hasten Mr Pineau-Valencienne's release after his arrest two weeks ago caused uproar in the French media and within the business community. The arrest prompted France's prime minister Edouard Balladur to phone his Belgian counterpart, Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, while Mr Alain Juppe, France's foreign minister, telephoned his opposite number, Mr Willy Claes. Sources close to the case say the French executive met Mr Van Espen yesterday afternoon, after further questioning by investigators recently returned from France and Switzerland. The accusations facing Schneider centre on its treatment of Cofibel and Cofimines and a bid, launched in 1992, to buy out minority shareholders in the two subsidiaries. Belgian prosecutors say there were irregularities in the offer. Mr Van Espen will now continue his investigation of the minority shareholders' complaints on the basis of what the searches in France, Italy and Switzerland have uncovered. Last week French and Belgian police searched the Paris headquarters of Schneider. The completed report will be presented to the Belgian prosecutors' office. It will then be up to an advisory court to decide whether to throw out the case or to refer it to the criminal court.</p>

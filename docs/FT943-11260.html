			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / BT urges shake-up of telecom regulation Rules governing UK broadcasting and telecommunications will need a radical overhaul to manage the growth of advanced 'superhighway' services, according to Sir Iain Vallance, chairman of British Telecommunications. Sir Iain called for a single 'communications regulator' as the telecoms, computing and broadcasting industries converge, in place of the existing array of regulators in each sector. He also called for cable operators to be subject to similar regulatory curbs to BT. Cable operators compete with BT, building local networks to offer telecoms, TV and advanced inter-active services. Sir Iain told the Financial Times that the 'ideal' regulatory structure would take on the functions of Oftel, the telecoms watchdog; the Independent Television Commission, which oversees part of the broadcasting industry; and the regulatory duties of several government departments. Sir Iain said the move might be driven by changes outside the UK, pointing to the European Union's Bangemann report on European 'superhighways', which raised the prospect of an EU-wide communications regulator. Supporting a recent suggestion by Mr Don Cruickshank, director-general of Oftel, Sir Iain said that when the present price cap on BT retail prices expires in 1997 it might be replaced with price restrictions on BT's network charges but freedom for BT to set retail prices. Mercury, BT's main competitor, already has more than a fifth of the market for international calls, where the case for ending BT's retail price cap is particularly strong. Sir Iain called for such a regime to apply to all telecoms operators with networks, 'rather than one which treated BT's network as a quasi-public asset which others should have access to on privileged terms'. That raises the prospect that BT might seek to retail services across the networks of other operators, particularly those of cable operators, who by 1997 will have several million subscribers and be offering inter-active services. Sir Iain said BT would seek special protection for 'superhighway' investments that upgraded its core network. BT to shed 50,000 jobs, Page 7</p>

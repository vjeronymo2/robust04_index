			<p>BFN     [Text] Small terrorist groups of "Red Sea" battalion  militants, retreating in disorder after escaping from the  antisubversive forces following clashes near Monzon, are  traveling to Ancash where Shining Path [SL] columns still exist  near Callejon de Conchucos.    This conclusion is based on reports to this daily by  intelligence experts who are evaluating military operation  "Aries," which was held recently in the Huallaga Front.    Analysts stated that SL members, who until a few weeks ago  camouflaged themselves by exchanging the rifle for the hoe and  who several times tried to ambush Army patrols, are in Ancash  after crossing the Jircan and Aranca (Huanuco) jungle.    The experts explained that they travel in small groups of  four to six subversives, looting settlements and forcing  peasants under death threat to house them in their small cabins  and to feed them.    They said operation "Aries" was 80 percent effective but due  to the harsh terrain and other factors, an undetermined number  of terrorists escaped from Huanuco toward the Ancash mountain  range.    They said the subversives may be in Llamellin on their way  to  Choccho and Sinachang but their objective is to reach Acobamba  and the Callejon de Conchucos where there are SL columns who  repeatedly conceal their weapons and mix with the peasants who  raise sheep.    The analysts said these subversives, like all SL militants,  ambush their enemy and then hide their weapons and appear to be  peasants or businessmen who have nothing to do with subversion.</p>

			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Finance and the Family: NS strategies / A look at the new fixed-rate products TAKING an income from fixed-rate National Savings products is a complicated process. After I had, in a recent article, made all the calculations for the 36th issue of certificates, the department promptly cancelled it. So, I went back to my calculator and worked out the figures for the latest issue, the 37th. It should be emphasised that these certificates are not designed to offer income; they offer the best returns to those who hold them for the full five years. Nevertheless, many people are unable to wait that long. It is possible to create an income stream by cashing the certificates in successive years. The 37th issue pays 5.5 per cent on the first anniversary; 6.2 per cent in the following year; 8 per cent in year three; 9.4 per cent in year four; and 11 per cent in the final year, for an overall return of 8 per cent per annum. (No income is paid on certificates cashed in before the first anniversary.) Unlike the 36th issue, the 37th allows for a maximum investment of Pounds 7,500 (Pounds 15,000 for couples), although you can re-invest old certificates up to a further Pounds 10,000. But before attempting any of these strategies, investors should check to see if they can get a better return elsewhere. According to Colin Jackson, of Baronworth Investment Services, a return of 8.46 per cent is available on a Pounds 7,500 guaranteed income bond. Since basic-rate tax is deducted from GIBs, basic-rate taxpayers will be better off buying them than using National Savings. The certificates are really only suitable vehicles for higher-rate taxpayers who want income. Strategy one is designed to produce a level income and leave the capital intact. By cashing Pounds 550, Pounds 525, Pounds 475 and Pounds 450 of certificates in successive years, the investor can get an income of between Pounds 574 and Pounds 595 a year. In the fifth year, he or she is left with Pounds 5,500 of certificates. These mature with a value of Pounds 8,081.72, leaving the investor to take Pounds 581.72 of income and Pounds 7,500 for re-investment. The average tax-free income has been around 7.8 per cent a year, compared with the 8 per cent compound total return which would have been received by leaving the money in for the full five years. In essence, the investor has given up Pounds 600 of return to get the income. Strategy two is designed to produce a steadily-growing income by cashing certificates worth Pounds 500, Pounds 500, Pounds 475 and Pounds 475 in successive years. The income will grow from Pounds 527 after year one to Pounds 655 after year five. Again, the full Pounds 7,500 is left for re-investment. What about non-taxpayers? They will be interested primarily in the new series-D capital bonds which pay a gross 10.75 per cent if held for five years. (Taxpayers should note that they are taxed each year on the assumed income from these bonds, even if they do not cash the bonds until the end of year five). Strategy three is designed to generate a steady income by investing Pounds 10,000 in the capital bonds. By cashing Pounds 950, Pounds 875, Pounds 800 and Pounds 725 of bonds in successive years, the investor can receive an income of between Pounds 1,014 and Pounds 1,034. At the end of year five, he will be left with certificates with a face value of Pounds 6,650, which will mature for Pounds 11,080. He can take the Pounds 1,080 as the final year's income, leaving Pounds 10,000 for re-investment. But the investor would have received around Pounds 1,500 more if he had left in the money for the full term.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                               STRATEGY ONE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Year                 Capital              Units              Income            retained (Pounds)   encashed (Pounds)   received (Pounds) 1993                   6,950               550               580.25 1994                   6,425               525               588.25 1995                   5,950               475               574.77 1996                   5,500               450               595.70 1997                     n/a             5,500               581.72  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- After taking income in 1997, Pounds 7,500 is left for reinvestment.

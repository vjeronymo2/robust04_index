			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / International Company News: American Brands rises to Dollars 202.6m AMERICAN Brands, the tobacco and consumer products conglomerate, reported an 8.7 per cent increase in second-quarter profits to Dollars 202.6m after tax, writes Nikki Tait. Total revenues rose by 10.5 per cent to Dollars 3.25bn, and net profits for the first six months of the year were up by 11.3 per cent to Dollars 447.8m. Mr William Alley, the company's chairman, conceded the economic environment had been tough, and price competition had intensified 'in almost every market'. Operating profit from tobacco, the largest single division, increased by 7.2 per cent in the second quarter, to Dollars 231.2m, while life insurance profits were up by 15.9 per cent to Dollars 42.9m. The drinks side saw the largest profits rise, up 35.3 per cent at Dollars 44.5m, but this partly reflected the acquisition of seven spirit brands from Canada's Seagram in 1991.</p>

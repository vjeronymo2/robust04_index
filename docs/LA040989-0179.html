			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHARLES HILLINGER'S AMERICA;  </P> <P> THE BUDGET CHRONICLES AMISH LIFE  </P> <P> The Budget, a nationally circulated weekly newspaper published for 99 years in  this tiny Ohio hamlet, has more than 500 reporters -- more contributing writers  than most, if not all, of the nation's largest dailies.  </P> <P> The Budget is not your run-of-the-mill country weekly. Its scribes, as the  newspaper's reporters are called, and its 18,000 subscribers are throwbacks to  the 19th Century.  </P> <P> They live in the past. They are farmers. They use horses to plow their fields,  a horse and buggy for transportation.  </P> <P> They're self-sufficient, erecting their own homes and barns, growing their own  livestock and crops. They get along without automobiles, electricity,  telephones, radios and television. They still use wood cook stoves, iceboxes  and outhouses. Kerosene lanterns are their source of light.  </P> <P> Readers of the Budget, which doesn't have headlines or photographs, wear  old-fashioned clothing made in their homes. Their shirts, trousers and  granny-style, ankle-length dresses have no zippers or buttons. Hooks and eyes  are used instead. Women and girls wear bonnets.  </P> <P> The Budget subscribers are Amish, an estimated 100,000 closely knit, religious  people whose simple way of life is a living museum of the past. The Amish are  scattered across the United States in tiny settlements from Montana to Florida,  from Texas to Upstate New York.  </P> <P> Since 1890, the Budget has been the sole communication link among Amish  settlements throughout the country. Each Amish community has a scribe who files  weekly or biweekly reports to the paper on the weather, births, weddings,  deaths, accidents, illnesses, buggy wrecks, sightings of the first robin in  spring, funny and odd happenings.  </P> <P> Reports from different communities -- at least 325 are published each issue --  are like letters from home. It's the way the Amish keep in touch with relatives  and friends all over America and find out what's happening in the far-flung  settlements of the plain people.  </P> <P> Scribes file their copy in longhand on sheets of lined paper or any scrap paper  such as backs of calendar pages or backs of children's homework. They mail the  latest news from their community to the Budget's office here in east-central  Ohio, 100 miles south of Cleveland, in the heart of Ohio's Amish country.  Sugarcreek has the largest concentration of Amish in the United States, with  nearly 20,000 living in Holmes, Wayne, Coshoctan and Tuscarawas counties --  more Amish than in Pennsylvania's Lancaster County.  </P> <P> The Budget doesn't print news about local, state, national or international  events or issues. The Amish aren't interested in what happens outside their own  communities; they have turned their back on the outside world. They don't read  daily newspapers, listen to the radio or watch television.  </P> <P> Crime stories are virtually non-existent because crime seldom occurs in Amish  settlements. Stories about politicians never appear in this newspaper. Amish  don't vote.  </P> <P> Some recent samples of the coverage found throughout this quaint 20- to 24-page  newspaper of the plain people:  </P> <P> Scribe Ida Kinsinger reports from Meyersdale, Pa.: "Katie Yoder's cough seems  to be letting up. They put a rag in hot vinegar and applying that on the chest,  then a flannel over it and then a plastic on top of that to hold in the heat.  The first night they had that on she rested better."  </P> <P> At the Farmerstown, Ohio, Meathouse: "The stuffer we used to stuff the bologna  broke. The lid popped up and we had 90 pounds of bologna mix all over the  ceiling and all over the walls. One worker had meat in the face and ears and up  the nose."  </P> <P> The big news from Cynthiana, Ky.: The Mullets "butchered a huge sow. She  weighed over 700 pounds. The lard was 3 inches thick on her back. She was fed  day-old baked goods."  </P> <P> In Swanton, Md., Lydia Mae Kauffman had a bad case of pinkeye. At Withee, Wis.,  "The chicken pox is visiting the children of the different homes." At  Limpytown, Ohio, "An albino red-tailed hawk was spotted." At Altamont, Tenn.,  "We feel extra busy the last three weeks since the flu found us. Seems like  there's always a nose to wipe or a dose of one thing or another to give to  someone."  </P> <P> And, at Fredericksburg, Ohio, "The church was well attended yesterday but  minister Loyd A. Yoder was not present due to a sore thumb. A knife hit him on  the thumb while working at home in the shop skinning it to the bone."  </P> <P> The scribes are volunteers. They receive no compensation other than a free  subscription to the paper and stamped envelopes to send in their reports. A  subscription to the Budget costs $21 a year. It is a distinctive honor for an  Amish to be a scribe for the Budget.  </P> <P> "We print the reports from our correspondents pretty much the way they write  them -- which often is in fractured English, but that's the charm of it," said  82-year-old George R. Smith, associate editor of the weekly newspaper.  </P> <P> "You know, the Amish speak Pennsylvania Dutch in their homes and at church.  English is a second language with them. Their education ends at eighth grade  because they don't want to learn too much about the world. They live the simple  life on the farm."  </P> <P> Smith has worked for the Budget 69 years, since he was 13, when his father,  Samuel Allan Smith, bought the paper in 1920. S. A. Smith was owner-publisher  until 1936 when he quit to become postmaster of Sugarcreek. George Smith  succeeded his father as publisher until he sold the paper in 1974 but he has  stayed on to supervise the scribes, to edit and lay out the paper.  </P> <P> There are different groups of Amish such as the Old Order, the New Order,  Swartzentruber Amish, Beachy Amish, Nebraska Amish. The Budget covers all  groups as America's Amish paper.  </P> <P> The Budget's plant is not in keeping with the traditional Amish ways. It is a  modern print shop. George Smith, a Lutheran, and the 11 others who put the  paper out are not Amish. That has been the case since the newspaper was first  published in 1890.  </P> <P> Smith probably knows more Amish than any other living person. He and his wife  of 54 years, Julia, each year make trips to Amish communities throughout the  country.  </P> <P> "Over the years I've seen some gradual changes in the people," Smith notes.  "They would never ride in a car, for example. Today, there are a number of  non-Amish men and women who make a living hauling Amish in cars and vans to  visit relatives, to attend weddings and funerals in other states.  </P> <P> "Another development is the creation of new communities in states where there  had not been Amish in the past, in places like Wisconsin, Missouri, Kentucky,  Tennessee, Texas. The Amish population doubles every 20 years and there is  always a need for young people to find new land so they move out from the  traditional settlements."  </P> <P> Smith said the Amish, almost to the person, are totally honest, passive, not  aggressive. "Scoundrels among them are extremely rare. I have tremendous  respect and admiration for them and for their life style."  </P> <P> As it has for nearly a century, the Budget continues to this day to bind the  plain people together.  </P></p>

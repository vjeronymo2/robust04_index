			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;184.114  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Repairs to acid equipment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Before a pipeline, pump, or other equipment exposed to acid is dismantled for repairs, it should be drained and washed down with water. All pressure shall be relieved; valves, switches, etc., shall be tagged or locked to prevent the accidental application of pressure or the introduction of acid into the line. Branch lines where pockets may exist require particular attention. All pumping on the system connected with parts under repair should cease, with starters tagged and locked, unless blank flanges in the lines cut off the affected parts from the pump. In breaking a flange, the bottom bolts should be loosened first and the first line allowed to sag slightly, permitting the liquid to run out by gravity. Spilled liquid shall be disposed of properly after the repairs. Absent other information, chemical pipelines shall be assumed to contain liquid.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Repairing used-steel acid tanks presents two types of hazards. Even a trace of weak acid or weak acid sludge shall violently react on the metal, generating gases. These could cause an explosion if welding is carried out on the tank. Personnel working inside the tank risk serious poisoning from the gases. Therefore, before repairs start, the tank shall be washed out, filled with water, then drained. If any acid remains, it may be necessary to apply soda ash solution and steam, then fill the tank with water, repeating the original procedure. Before entering tanks, check that sufficient oxygen is present. When someone is working inside the tank, an observer shall be present, with at least one other person available for rescue work, should the worker in the tank be overcome; such personnel shall receive training in tank rescue work. Those entering tanks shall have respiratory protective equipment, life belts, or harnesses and lifelines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Neutralizing spills.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Slaked (hydrated) lime shall be available to neutralize spilled acid. A 10 to 20 percent solution of sodium bicarbonate shall remove acid from floors or equipment. Because neutralization generates heat, care shall be taken in cleaning large quantities of acid. Soda or other alkaline solutions shall neutralize all places made slippery by acid, which shall then be flushed with water.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Mixing acid with water.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The acid shall be added to the water, never the water added to the acid, when significant amounts are being diluted. Acid should be added slowly with agitation. Weak acid replacing water as the diluting agent requires similar precautions. Solutions shall be thoroughly mixed, particularly in steel tanks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Empty containers.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Carboys that have contained acids shall be thoroughly drained before being offered for transportation. They shall be shipped in the same manner as full items.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;184.115  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Mixed acids. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Mixed acids include mixtures of sulfuric and nitric acids used in the nitration of various explosives constituents. The pressure of liberated gases sometimes causes carboys of mixed acids to rupture violently. Mixed acids can start fires, generate gases that cause explosions, and emit poisonous oxides of nitrogen. Mixed acid containing not less than 10 percent of nitric acid shall not freeze at ordinary temperatures and shall not actively attack steel storage tanks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;184.116  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Waste acids (spent acids).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Waste acids usually contain small amounts of nitrobodies, so present the hazard of explosive material. Spent acid from the manufacture of nitroglycerin and liquid esters are particularly hazardous.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;184.117  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Nitric acid.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Nitric acid forms explosive compounds with most organic materials. With most oxidizable material, it forms flammable compounds, some of which are subject to spontaneous ignition. Nitric acid fire creates exceedingly toxic oxides of nitrogen. Buildings where nitric acid is used shall have proper ventilation. Enough space shall separate them to allow for firefighting forces; also, to prevent the accumulation of acid ``fumes'' (sometimes colorless, at other times identifiable, ranging from dark yellow to brown). The first symptoms of nitrous poisoning are usually followed by a latent period, when the victim feels comfortable though the poisoning continues. For this reason, anyone with even mild symptoms of nitrous poisoning shall immediately be made completely still and attended by a physician as soon as possible. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;184.118  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Sulfuric acid (oil of vitriol).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Concentrated sulfuric acid chars wood, cotton, and vegetable fibers, usually without causing fire, but oleum (fuming sulfuric acid) usually does cause fire in these materials. The addition of water may create heat sufficient to cause a fire or explosion, and greatly increases the corrosive properties of oleum. This does not preclude the use of large quantities of water to dilute or dissipate small quantities of acid. Sulfuric acid shall not be stored with nitric acid, volatile or flammable liquids, or oxidizing agents. It may be stored in carboys, drums, tanks, glass bottles, and in large outdoor tanks. All precautions listed for sulfuric acid apply to oleum. In an emergency, sand, earth, or other noncombustibles may be used to absorb oleum spilled or leaking from storage containers. Once the crisis has passed, the oleum-soaked mass can be neutralized with solid carbonates, such as calcium carbonate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;184.119  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Oxidizing agents. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following discussion is limited to the inorganic oxidizing agents, because the organic agents, such as nitrobenzene, are often violent explosives and should come with special storage and handling instructions. Inorganic oxidizing agents include the chlorates, perchlorates, peroxides, and nitrates of barium, sodium, potassium, strontium, ammonium, etc. Their ability to furnish oxygen renders oxiding agents hazardous, and violent explosions may occur when they are mixed or contaminated with minute quantities of certain carbonaceous and combustible materials such as wood, paper, metal powders, sulfur, etc. The violence of reaction depends upon subdivision, extent of contamination, degree of confinement, and type of initiation. Shoes, clothing, and other combustible materials covered with dust or solutions of oxidizing agents also represent dangers. Intimate mixtures of finely divided oxidizers and fuels are very sensitive to heat, friction, and impact. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;184.120  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Handling oxidizing agents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Oxidizing agents shall be stored and processed only in fire-resistive rooms or buildings. They shall be separated from fuels, flammable materials, metal powders, and acids until processing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Evans Halshaw acquires Davenport for Pounds 33m and makes Pounds 29m cash call Evans Halshaw, Solihull-based motor distributor, has made a recommended Pounds 32.6m offer for Davenport Vernon, the motor dealer, and is raising Pounds 29m via a 3-for-10 rights issue priced at 425p. The merger of Davenport's 28 dealerships with the Evans' 58 represents a further consolidation in the motor distribution sector and comes two weeks after BSG International bid Pounds 20m for Jessups. Some 50.5 per cent of the Davenport equity has been committed to Evans which is offering 100 new shares for every 288 Davenport shares or a cash alternative of 155p. The share offer values each Davenport share at 172p, which is a premium of 52 per cent over the overnight price. At yesterday's close Davenport was up 45p at 158p while Evans fell 31p to 484p. The proceeds of the rights - underwritten by Kleinwort Benson - will fund the cash alternative and, unless there is unexpected reluctance to accept Evans paper, also pay for the Pounds 7m acquisition of a private motor dealing company, the future of which is subject to negotiations. Evans has made no secret of its desire for acquisitions and has had a lengthy courtship with Davenport. 'We've had close connections for three years and have had discussions on a number of occasions,' said Mr Geoff Dale, Evans chairman. Davenport had a rights issue last year but a profits warning last March indicated a weakening financial position and this opened the way for the offer. Yesterday the company announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 478,000 for the six months to March 31 on a turnover of Pounds 88m. It is paying an interim dividend of 0.5p. Evans expects to be able to extract higher performance and wider margins from the Davenport chain of dealerships. Its dealerships in counties on the north-west side of London complement Evans' geographical strength in the Midlands and south-east England. Evans yesterday forecast an interim dividend of 5p for 1994. This represents an increase of about 15 per cent over last year and it is intended that it will be 33 per cent of the total. Kleinwort Benson acted for Evans in the takeover and NatWest Securities for Davenport. COMMENT Evans Halshaw shareholders can thank institutional reluctance to buy motor distributor shares and market fatigue with capital raising for an advantageously priced rights. The shares anyway have come off their high point for the year just as profits are set to jump sharply. The combined Evans Halshaw-Davenport Vernon group should make Pounds 15m pre-tax this year and that would give earnings on the enlarged capital of about 35p a share. That would put the new shares on a prospective multiple of just over 12, which should not be a very severe test of loyalty.</p>

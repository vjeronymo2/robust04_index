			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Text] Russia's Defense Minister Pavel Grachev held a news  conference today. He said that a criticial situation has arisen  as regards financing the Armed Forces. Thus, in January of this  year, the Defense Ministry received only 63 percent of the  planned appropriations. Pavel Grachev stated that if in the  very near future the situation does not improve there cannot be  any question of any reforming of the Army or of maintaining its  high combat effectiveness. He said that this year the Army  would in real terms be cut by 200,000 men instead of the  scheduled 400,000. The reason for this is that it is more  expensive to discharge an officer than to keep him -- each  officer being discharged needs to be simultaneously paid 20  monthly wages. This year purchases of armaments will be  considerably reduced. This could have a deplorable effect on  the defense industry enterprises and the development of new  military technologies. Pavel Grachev strongly criticized the  way trade in Russian arms is being conducted: He believes that  opportunities to earn billions of rubles are being missed.    The journalists also inquired how the Army would react to a  possible increase in social tension in the country. Grachev  said that the armed forces are outside politics, but would not  permit a civil war.</p>

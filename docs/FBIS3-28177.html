Recalling that the Kim Yong-sam group incriminated peasants'  rally held on February 1 to check the rice market opening and  has countered it with ruthless fascist suppression, the news  analyst says:    The traitor Kim Yong-sam who deserves stern punishment by  the  people for his arch crimes is exasperatingly brandishing the  sword against the people, growling. This tells that the Kim  Yong-sam group is, indeed, a pack of despicable and wicked  traitors who are lost to human reason and without an iota of  national conscience.    Always miserable was the end of the successive traitors who  attempted to find a way out through ruthless suppression.    Brutal suppression by the traitor Kim Yong-sam will only  touch off a fiercer resistance of the South Korean people who  rose to overthrow the "civilian" regime.</p>

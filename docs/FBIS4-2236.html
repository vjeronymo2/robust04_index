			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 8 (XINHUA) -- Japanese Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa tendered his resignation today to take the  responsibility for the stalemate in Diet deliberations on the  state budget for fiscal 1994, caused by a persisting controversy  over his dubious financial deals.    "I have told the leaders of my coalition government and an  emergency meeting of the cabinet of my intention to resign,"  Hosokawa told a press conference at his official residence in  Tokyo. "I have received their approval," he added.    Hosokawa said he bears the responsibility for the wranglings  between the ruling coalition and the opposition camp over his  loans from the scandal-tainted Sagawa Kyubin Co., which has kept  the Diet budget business paralysed.    The announcement came only days after a media frenzy over  reports on his joking about stepping down, which he strongly  denied.    Hosokawa had refused the opposition Liberal Democratic  Party's demand to summon his former aide to the Diet over his  100 million yen (950,000 U.S. dollars) loan from Sagawa, and  denied he was personally involved in a Nippon Telegraph and  Telephone Corp. (NTT) share purchase, which he said was done by  his late father-in-law.    Earlier, before the news conference, he suddenly summoned  the  leaders of the coalition to the premier's official residence and  formally told them he was quitting.    "The reason for my decision to resign is the paralysis in  the  Diet," one coalition official quoted Hosokawa as telling his  colleagues at an emergency cabinet session.    He also said a new problem has been uncovered about his  personal financial management, according to TV reports. But he  did not specify the issue.    Hosokawa, 56, took office last August, ending a 38-year-long  grip on state power by the Liberal Democratic Party.</p>

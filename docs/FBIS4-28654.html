			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 13 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  said Monday that Japan can engage only in nonmilitary support in  UN or other multinational forces operations in the event of an  international crisis.    Hata made the remark at a meeting of the House of  Councillors  Budget Committee in reply to Makoto Taneda, legislator from the  Social Democratic Party, the No. 2 opposition party.    "Medical services or minesweeping following the end of  fighting, such as those Japan carried out in the Persian Gulf,  could be possible," Hata said when asked what kind of support  Japan can provide. "But it would be extremely difficult to  engage in those united with military actions."    As for the right of collective security in the UN Charter,  Takao Ode, director general of the cabinet legislation bureau,  said Japan owns the right as a sovereign state, but cannot  execute it because of the constitution that renounces war.    "The pacifism and the spirit of international cooperation in  the preamble of the constitution agree with the ideas in the UN  Charter," Ode said. "Japan will do its duty within the  Constitution, and cannot use, or threaten to use, forces banned  in Article 9 of the Constitution."    Regarding possible UN sanctions against North Korea over its  suspected nuclear development program, Hata declined to say what  steps Japan can take in the sanctions because of an anxiety "of  sending the wrong message" to North Korea.    Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa told the same session Japan  and South Korea have agreed that the sanctions should not be  punitive, but should be those urging North Korea to return to a  safeguard system of the International Atomic Energy Agency.    Hata told reporters earlier in the day that Japan supports  the resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue through  dialogue.    Meanwhile, a government source said Japan cannot take the  initiative and needs to "give priority to the intentions of  South Korea."</p>

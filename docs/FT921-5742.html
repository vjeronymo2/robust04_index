			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / Adams pulls out of Senate race SENATOR Brock Adams of Washington has pulled out of his bid for election to a second Senate term after being accused of sexual harassment of employees and political associates. The Democratic senator said that it was 'not worth it to continue this campaign,' but denied the allegations, which he said had been created 'by people who hate me.' The Seattle Times, the principal newspaper in Mr Adams' home state, reported that eight unidentified women had accused the senator of kissing and fondling them. One said that he had drugged and then raped her. Mr Adams, who sat for 12 years in the House of Representatives before serving as transportation secretary under President Jimmy Carter, was already considered to have been weakened by a similar sexual harassment allegation made in 1987 by a former congressional aide. No charges were ever filed, and the US district attorney found the allegation 'without merit.' Nevertheless, Mr Adams' position was badly damaged. Mr Adams' seat has been regarded as one of the best opportunities for a Republican challenger to cut the Democrats' 57-43 majority in the Senate, along with that of Senator Timothy Wirth in Colorado. However, the Democrats are mounting strong challenges in at least seven Republican-held states, and now stand a good chance of expanding their Senate majority.</p>

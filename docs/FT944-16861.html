			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Strong rise in shares in modest trading volume - Market report A wide-ranging but somewhat thinly-supported rally in UK stocks yesterday took the FT-SE 100 Share Index comfortably clear of the 3,000 mark. With the US bond market shut down for the day, London equities responded readily to firmness in British government bonds and to a good premium on the Footsie future contract, although volume in the derivatives market was also low. Most of the gain came at the opening of the session, and the final reading of 3,032.3 on the FT-SE 100 Index, while showing a net gain of 33.6 on the day, was a shade off the mid-morning level. The strength of German bond and equity markets helped UK markets forward. The market appeared unaffected by developments in the Middle East, although oil shares were generally firmer behind strengthening crude oil prices. Traders said that the rebound in share prices reflected an oversold market, with bear covering encouraged by further signs of returning stability in the gilt-edged market. The latest survey of fund managers' opinion by Smith New Court, the London securities house, and Gallup, indicted significantly increased optimism towards UK government bonds; a more stable bond market is regarded as the necessary basis for a genuine upturn in equities. The fund managers' survey appeared to indicate the impact of the latest rise in base rates on domestic inflation. There was little response to the day's economic data, showing a modest rise in UK producer in prices and some improvement in consumer spending. This week will bring a heavy list of economic data. Domestic inflation figures will be published tomorrow, but dealers said that the chief test will come at the end of the week when US industrial production and plant capacity statistics are due. The company news list was headed by Lucas Industries which rose sharply on news of higher profits and a greater focus on the automotive business. There was little distinction between the blue chip market and the second line issues. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index added 35.3 to 3,482.8. Seaq volume dipped to 488.7m shares from Friday's 512.4m; retail or customer business on Friday returned a worth of Pounds 1.42bn. London took little notice yesterday afternoon of the Dow Industrial Average, up 16 in UK trading hours in a New York market moving at half speed for Columbus Day. The strongest rebounds came among the bank shares. Retail or consumer issues made some headway, although dealers admitted that trading volumes had been unimpressive. Shares in Eurotunnel made progress after the first reports disclosed a favourable trend in freight volume during the first two months of operation. Much of the trade recorded yesterday consisted of professional bargain-hunting by securities houses unwilling to wait for the return to full trading in New York this afternoon. While many analysts still predict that the London stock market will improve before Christmas, they also believe that any improvement should be viewed as 'no more than a seasonal rally.' There are also fears that consumer spending power may remain squeezed during the coming twelve months, thereby continuing to deprive the economic recovery of an important impetus. This combination of cautious optimism and nervous concern has caused market analysts to recommend shares regarded as dependable, rather than those offering potentially above average growth. This somewhat muted confidence depends on assumptions that UK base rates will remain unchanged until the new year. Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK chancellor of the exchequer, said yesterday that he had seen no further evidence of domestic inflation since his last meeting with the Governor of the Bank of England.</p>

			<p><P> July 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 3 NUNS END 8-MONTH PROTEST, LEAVE MONASTERY  </P> <P> Three of four Roman Catholic nuns who barricaded themselves in a monastery  nearly nine months ago to protest liberalization of their austere order ended  the standoff Saturday, a diocesan spokesman said.  </P> <P> The fourth woman, whose temporary vows expired earlier in the year, remained in  the infirmary at the Monastery of the Most Blessed Virgin Mary of Mt. Carmel,  said Timothy Manning of the Paterson Diocese.  </P> <P> Five of the 13 Carmelite nuns at the monastery barricaded themselves in the  infirmary Oct. 4, saying they feared eviction for protesting a new prioress'  introduction of television and sweets.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Action a Surprise  </P> <P> Manning said Saturday's action was a surprise. "We're presuming that the  realization finally hit them that if they wanted to save their vows, they were  going to have to leave."  </P> <P> Manning said the diocese had planned to deliver an order Monday demanding the  nuns leave the monastery.  </P> <P> The nuns had maintained they would not leave the building until they were  ordered to by the Apostolica Signatura, the highest court of the Vatican.  </P> <P> The nuns have twice ignored orders from lower-level Vatican officials.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hangs Up Phone  </P> <P> Lynn Williams, formerly Sister Teresita, was the only nun remaining at the  infirmary Saturday. She hung up the telephone when reached by a reporter  seeking comment.  </P> <P> The location of the other nuns was not known, Manning said.  </P> <P> Betty Sutton, a lay person who has acted as a spokeswoman for the nuns, said  she did not know where they went.  </P></p>

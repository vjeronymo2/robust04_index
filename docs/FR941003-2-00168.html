The changes to part (ii), and the addition of part (iii), of OFPA A&hyph;2 would permit Specialists to accept contingency orders currently forwarded through the Automated Options Market System (also known as ``AUTOM'') without the requirement of approval by an Exchange floor official (``Floor Official''). Such contingency orders would include those currently listed and defined in paragraph (c) of Phlx Rule 1066, <FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>  as well as additional types of contingency orders that the Exchange is proposing to add to Rule 1066(c). In addition, the Exchange is proposing to make changes to the fine schedule of OFPA A&hyph;2. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Phlx Rule 1066 generally sets forth certain types of orders, including contingency orders, market orders, and limit orders. Paragraph (c) of Rule 1066 lists certain types of contingency orders, and specifically defines such orders. Currently, the contingency orders currently listed and defined under paragraph (c) are stop (stop-loss) orders, stop-limit orders, delta orders, and multi-part orders. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Curently, a Specialist is prohibited under OFPA A&hyph;2 from accepting contingency orders, other than stop (stop-loss) and stop-limit orders, without the express approval of a Floor Official. <FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>  The proposed changes would make permissible the acceptance of contingency orders by Specialists without the approval of a Floor Official. The change would extend the acceptance of certain contingency orders without floor official approval beyond the currently permitted acceptance of stop (stop-loss) and stop-limit orders to include contingency orders as defined as such in Rule 1066(c), and will apply to both customer and broker-dealer accounts. Furthermore, a Specialist would be able to refuse to accept contingency orders, but may only refuse to accept contingency orders from customer accounts upon the prior approval of two Floor Officials. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In addition, a Specialist is prohibited from accepting option orders consisting of two or more option series ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  spread, straddle, and/or combination orders).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Phlx OFPA A&hyph;2.

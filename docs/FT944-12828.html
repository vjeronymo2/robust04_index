			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / This Week: Australia, winning at any price - Sport Sport is Australia's established church. Something has to be, in what is one of the world's most enthusiastically secular nations, a place where organised religion is seldom glimpsed. In Perth, England's cricketers are currently playing Western Australia in the first major game of the Ashes tour. For England players such as Darren Gough and Joey Benjamin, debutantes Down Under, their first hours in the vast amphitheatre of the West Australian Cricket Association ground (or WACA, to rhyme with Packer) will be unforgettable. The pitch is as iron-hard as the spectators, let alone the Aussie cricketers. Ten years ago I awoke, jet-lagged, on the first day of my first visit to Australia in a hotel room adjoining the WACA. An England v Australia Test match was in progress. It was a Saturday, so I found my way to the main stand, on the fringe of a group of tough-looking characters each with a two-litre jug of ice-cold Emu lager to hand. Their concentration on every ball and every stroke was ferocious. At the tea interval I summoned the courage to ask if they had come far to see the match. They were iron-ore miners from the Pilbara, based at Port Hedland nearly 1,000 miles away, and had driven down through the night to see just one day of the Test. Most had to be back at work the next morning. It was a revelatory insight into the commitment - sometimes joyless but always effective - that sport inspires across the Wide Brown Land. A few days ago a friend in Sydney sent me a copy of The Bid, a recently-published account of how Sydney won the battle to host the 2000 Olympic Games. Since the author of the book is Rod McGeoch, the corporate lawyer who spent three years and ADollars 28m (Pounds 12.5m) as head of the bidding team, it should be the inside story. Overall it reminds me in tone and content of nothing so much as modern military history - the unglimpsed staff-work behind victory in the Falklands or on the Normandy beaches, for example. McGeoch's team knew from Day 1 that their goal was to capture the votes of 94 members of the International Olympic Committee. Athens' loss to Atlanta in 1990 had convinced them that underdogs could win. 'Sentimental favourites and powerful candidates could be beaten using a well thought-out strategy based on building personal relationships with the IOC members', writes McGeoch, who, at the outset of the campaign, had never met anyone from the IOC. Sydney put a remarkable effort into getting this all-powerful electorate to visit them. When the IOC held its 1991 annual conference in Birmingham, McGeoch and his team were naturally prowling the lobbies, urging 'the voters' to hop on a Qantas flight asap. Furthermore, they had an official of the Australian Immigration Service, a department modelled on the Kremlin, sitting in reception at the Hyatt Regency handing out instant visas. Lobbies and lobbying loom large in The Bid. McGeoch and his charm offensive were constantly present at major international sports conferences. 'We would go to all the official functions', he writes. 'But a large part of what we did was actually wait around hotel lobbies where members were either staying or attending meetings to catch them for a chat. . . I'd insist we had a roster of people to wait around the lobbies. When our wives travelled with us they too would be rostered. We used to call ourselves 'lobby lizards'.' At the Albertville winter Olympics, New South Wales premier Nick Greiner caught a little flak for slipping the lobby leash and going off skiing. At the IOC session in Birmingham the Aussies would rise at dawn to ensure that they got the largest, most prominent table at breakfast in the Hyatt, so that members might join them for coffee and croissants if they wished. A campaign rule rigidly precluded approaching any VIP who was already eating. Government, both state and federal, figures largely in this account. Manchester, which was bidding for the same Games, made much of the fact that it had some Whitehall cash and occasionally got to see prime minister John Major. Sydney's bid had politicians crawling all over it, and was practically an arm of the state. 'I always had to remember that I was a public servant whose responsibility it was to make sure that I did not embarrass my minister,' writes McGeoch. Beijing was Sydney's great rival for the 2000 Olympics, and The Bid focuses on the 'official' nature of China's campaign, with hundreds of government officials scurrying around. Yet in some ways this 'quango' element was what the two favourites had in common. Manchester and Berlin, in comparison, were models of free enterprise initiative. When the IOC members were actually in Sydney they were feted beyond belief, not so much with lavish wining and dining - now against the rules - but with little tricks that money couldn't buy. One night at the Opera House an IOC member's wife became unavoidably delayed in the ladies' toilet during the interval. Despite an increasingly restive audience, the general manager was summoned and told that the show must not go on. Not a note was sung until 'Mrs K' had resumed her seat. England's cricketers are about to start a battle for the Ashes against a team as formidably well prepared as Australia's Olympic campaign. In business, Australians tend to cut corners. Culturally, they aim low. But in sport they will pay any price and make any sacrifice to win.</p>

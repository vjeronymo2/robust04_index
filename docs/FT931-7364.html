			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Lira feels effects of confidence vote UNCERTAINTIES over the outcome of the vote of confidence on the weekend cabinet reshuffle by the Italian prime minister, Mr Giuliano Amato, yesterday pushed the lira to historic lows against all main currencies. But in the highly volatile atmosphere of Italian politics, with parties battered by the national corruption scandal and riven by internal differences, Mr Amato yesterday appeared to have clawed back essential support. Both his own Socialist party and the Christian Democrats, the dominant partners in his four-party coalition, indicated they would back him in the vote due today. On Tuesday elements within both parties had hinted that they might withdraw their backing in the vote which was called by the 54-year-old prime minister. The prospect of the government falling without a clear replacement for the prime minister yesterday forced the lira at one stage below the L990 level against the D-Mark. The lira ended last week at L963 following the resignation of the finance and health ministers which forced Sunday's cabinet reshuffle. Since last September's currency crisis when the lira was forced to float, the Italian currency has devalued almost 30 per cent against the D-Mark and even further against the dollar. The lira has now depreciated to levels which the Bank of Italy regards as unrealistic. Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the bank's governor, commented yesterday: 'The present quotations of the lira are obviously undervalued and completely out of line with the state and prospectives of the Italian economy.' Dealers said yesterday that if the main political parties in the coalition continued to show signs of less than whole-hearted support for the Amato government the markets were bound to be nervous. The authorities are concerned that further devaluation of the currency at these levels could affect prices. Preliminary figures for February suggest that the continuous downward trend in inflation since the second half of 1992 has been interrupted and that the first effects of devaluation are beginning to work their way through - despite the deepening recession. The confidence debate, which began yesterday, is due to wind up today. But there are also moves to have the process repeated in the Senate. Mr Amato antagonised the party rank and file by failing to consult sufficiently over the reshuffle.</p>

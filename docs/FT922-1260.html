			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Sluggishness of US recovery spreads gloom Wall Street ALTHOUGH US share prices recovered from heavy early losses yesterday, market sentiment remained depressed amid deepening gloom about the sluggishness of the US economic recovery and its effect on corporate earnings, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was finally off 4.55 at 3,280.80, a substantial rally from early afternoon when it had been 30 points down. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 lost a net 0.27 at 403.40, he American SE composite shed 3.77 to 375.62 and the Nasdaq composite gave up 4.47 at 549.73. Turnover on the New York SE was 169m shares. The market has fallen in four out of the last five trading days (the only exception being Friday when options-related buying lifted the Dow 11 points), and analysts have interpreted the declines as part of a concerted sell-off by investors - a substantial correction of the recent bull phase. Some say that an increasing number of investors now believe equities are overvalued and, troubled by the feebleness of the economic recovery, find more reasons to sell stocks than to buy them. Merck bucked the trend, rising Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 50 1/2 in heavy trading on news that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had approved the company's Proscar drug, used in the treatment of enlarged prostate glands. Another rare gain was recorded by Time Warner, which rose Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 110 7/8 as investors celebrated news that the new Batman Returns film, produced by subsidiary Warner Brothers, earned more than Dollars 46m in gross receipts over its opening weekend. Boeing eased Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 41 7/8 on reports that the aircraft manufacturer is fighting European consortium Airbus Industries for a Dollars 2.4bn contract for jetliners from United Airlines. International Rectifier dropped Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 8 1/8 after the company warned that previous earnings projections were too optimistic and said its fiscal fourth-quarter net would be only slightly in the black. The losses on Latin American, and especially Mexican, markets took their toll of certain stocks, notably Telmex, down Dollars 2 7/8 at Dollars 44 7/8 , Mexico Fund, Dollars 1 5/8 lower at Dollars 20 7/8 , and Brazil Fund, off Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 17 1/2 . On the Nasdaq market, Heart Technology plunged a further Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 9 1/4 after voluntarily recalling its coronary rotablator device following five reported failures. On Friday the stock fell sharply when the company asked customers to stop using the product. Canada TORONTO rallied from early weakness in line with Wall Street, the TSE 300 index ending a net 10.2 off at 3,340.7 after a near 30-point initial fall. Declines led rises by 342 to 219 and volume was 23m shares. The gold group recovered from Friday's decline, rising 1.37 per cent. The New York spot gold price was up USDollars 2.75 to USDollars 343.25 an ounce.</p>

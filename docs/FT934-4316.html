			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Own-brand groceries challenge premium products Most British shoppers believe 'own brand' groceries sold by supermarket chains offer at least as good value as branded products from leading manufacturers, a survey shows. The survey, by retail consultancy Verdict Research, says the popularity of own-brand lines and their growing use by retailers to spearhead price-cutting campaigns pose a serious threat to branded manufacturers, which may have to lower prices further to avoid losing sales. Almost two thirds of consumers said the quality of own brands was equal to or better than leading branded equivalents. Almost three-quarters said own-brand prices were about the same or cheaper. J. Sainsbury's own brands scored highest on quality. Almost two-thirds of consumers also said they rated the quality of 'no-frills' own-brand products at Kwik Save, the discount chain, superior or equal to manufacturer brands. About a third of consumers said they were likely to choose own-brand versions of biscuits, cakes, canned groceries and dairy products over manufacturers' brands. Less than 10 per cent said they preferred own-brand beer and pet food. Verdict says Tesco was using own brands more aggressively than any other large supermarket chain as a price-cutting weapon. Tesco brands were being displayed much more prominently and stocked in larger quantities. The cheapest supermarket was Kwik Save, where a basket of groceries cost Pounds 29.18, while the same goods at Tesco cost Pounds 35.12. Waitrose was dearest, at Pounds 39.58, followed by Safeway and Sainsbury's. The research into shelf-space and pricing was carried out in late October, shortly before Sainsbury's cut prices on 300 own-brand lines. Cross-channel shoppers are spending about Pounds 400m a year on personal imports of beer, wine and spirits. A report yesterday by Verdict says that increased allowances of personal imports of duty-paid drinks this year have had 'a dramatic impact'. Although the chancellor did not increase the duty on beer or spirits in the Budget, the outlook for UK off-licences is not bright, Verdict says. Price competition has intensified in the Pounds 6.5bn take-home market and profit margins of specialist shops are wafer thin. Supermarkets have benefited most from growth in the take-home trade and now claim 56 per cent of sales. Off-licences are attempting to match prices but only the biggest chains, Thresher and Victoria Wine, have the buying power to compete on price for a prolonged period, the report says. Verdict on Grocery Brands, Pounds 850. Verdict on Off-Licences 1993, Pounds 725. Verdict Research, 112 High Holborn, London WC1V 6JS.</p>

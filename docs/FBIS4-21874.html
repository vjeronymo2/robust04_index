			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sana' al-Imam from Damascus] </F>   [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] The Iranian parliamentary  delegation led by Hojjat ol-Eslam Hasan Ruhani, Iranian deputy  Majles speaker, held several meetings in Damascus with the  pro-Iran Iraqi opposition factions, such as al- Da'wah Party and  the Supreme Assembly of the Islamic Revolution. Ruhani was  quoted as saying that those who depend on the United States to  liberate Iraq will be disappointed because the United States  wants to control Iraq.    Ruhani also held talks with the 10 Palestinian factions that  oppose the Gaza-Jericho accord. He also held talks in Damascus  with representatives of the Hizballah and the Islamic resistance  in Lebanon. Following his meeting with those representatives,  Ruhani stressed the importance of a united Islamic resistance  stand, reiterating Iran's readiness to continue to support  Islamic resistance against Israeli schemes.    In a statement to Monte Carlo, Palestinian sources denied  any  Iranian financial siege on Hizballah and the Islamic Jihad.  They stressed that the delay in Iranian financial aid in  October 1993 was caused by a financial crisis in the Bank of  Iran. This was communicated to them by the Iranian leadership  in a written letter. The Palestinian sources said this temporary  delay completely ended by December 1993.</p>

			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UCLA SHOULD BUILD A SCHOOL AT PARK  </P> <P> It would be a real boon to Santa Monica to have UCLA build an elementary school  at Los Amigos Park or at either of the present elementary school sites in Ocean  Park.  </P> <P> At first, the thought of having a school built on a park appalled me, until I  realized that there will be a school built there anyway.  </P> <P> Having UCLA build it not only saves the Santa Monica school district the task  of building a school, but provides the community with higher quality and more  progressive education for our children. The money saved will allow the school  district to spend more on other schools in the area.  </P> <P> Most important, it eliminates the school district's need to develop or sell the  John Muir and Washington schools' sites to raise money to build the much-needed  new school. Thus, those sites have a good chance of maintaining some open space  and, in the case of Washington school, possibly a park.  </P> <P> All other open areas near Washington School on 4th Street in the southwest  section of Ocean Park have recently been built on by the city. We need open  space more than we need more condominiums. It seems that the best way to do  that and to provide our children with a valuable new school environment is to  welcome (University Elementary School) to our community.  </P> <P> SHELLEY MILLS  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Survey: FT Traveller, Genoa (10) - Part of the fabric of life / Wine, Vine cultivation on the steep and windy slopes of the Cinque Terre requires strong leg muscles and a head for heights 'YOU NEED a passion to do it. Many only keep up the tradition out of respect for their parents.' So Mr Nello Capris, a leading Genoese wine expert, describes the task of vine cultivation in the wild Cinque Terre, where strong leg muscles and a head for heights are as much pre-requisites for success as green fingers with the grape. Producing wine on the steep and windy slopes of the Cinque Terre, the five small villages just north of La Spezia, around 75 miles south of Genoa, is, says Mr Capris, 'a heroic task'. The narrow terraces perched along the near-vertical hillsides plunging down towards the sea offer little scope for mechanisation. Much of the work, including the carrying, is still done by hand. 'No one could keep a family solely on the income from growing wine,' he explains. 'Growing vines is now virtually all part-time work, either done as a second job or left to those who have already retired.' In spite of the immense difficulties, the wine business has not eroded, like many of the harsh hillsides which face the sea. For growing wine is part of the fabric of life in a region which, in spite of its immense tourist appeal, still depends largely on traditional sources of income for its livelihood. Without their vineyards, the five villages which make up the remote Cinque Terre would still be magnets for visitors on account of their ragged beauty and commanding views, but part of their magic would be lost. It is largely because of tourism that the two white wines of the Cinque Terre - Cinqueterre and Sciaccetra - are among the best known of all Liguria's produce, in spite of the relatively small quantities produced visitors buy the fruity Cinqueterre or, to a much lesser extent, sweet Sciaccetra dessert wine, in much the same decorative three-bottle cardboard packs as are found in other locations where tourism and wine-growing go hand in hand like Rudesheim on the Rhine or the villages south of Strasbourg in Alsace. Like their counterparts elsewhere in Italy, the growers of the Cinque Terre have recently woken up to the possibilities of 'agro-tourism'. Largely united in the Co-operativa Agricoltora Cinqueterre, the local growers are now starting to convert some of the small abandoned shacks dotted around the hillsides into basic accommodation for visitors. Tourists searching for five-star luxury should look elsewhere. But the provision of electricity and running water to the huts, traditionally used for storage and even temporary accommodation for workers on outlying vineyards, could appeal to the thousands of walkers and ramblers who descend on the region each year. Meanwhile, for the local economy, converting the huts could persuade visitors to stay for longer than the usual day-trip, which contributes little revenue to the community. By combining their interests, the members of the co-operative have helped to maintain an industry marked by a steady decline in the past. 'The problem is that the population is getting older, and the young people are drifting away. You can't change it,' says Mr Capris. Economic pressures make it increasingly difficult for younger members of wine-growing families to maintain the family business. The co-operative may not be able completely to reverse the tide, but it is at least trying to make the best of what is left. Agreement has already been reached with some local growers to give the co-operative the right of first refusal over their land should they decide to go out of business. Meanwhile, the co-operative, which comprises around three quarters of the local producers, has also strengthened their lobbying powers when it comes to outside bodies. Most recently, they secured funding from the European Community to install around 30 narrow mini-railways up some of the steepest local slopes to make the task of transporting grapes after harvest less of an endurance test. The Cinque Terre is the best known of the wine-growing areas of Liguria, but the region as a whole is as unfamiliar to most Italians as it is to foreigners on account of its limited output. Producing only around 300,000 hectolitres of wine a year, Liguria is one of Italy's smallest wine-growing zones, representing barely 0.5 per cent of national output. However, it is slowly gaining ground, reckons Mr Capris. Quality has improved, especially over the past decade. 'Ligurian wine was not always produced that professionally. It didn't always look good, nor keep well. Now we've managed to convince more top restaurants to take local wines, and they've been pleased with their choice,' he says. Like much in Liguria, the wine-growing region forms two sides of an arc with Genoa at its head. Although most of the wine business is concentrated in two areas around Albenga to the west and La Spezia to the east, even Genoa itself has some wines. The city's wines do not merit being classed among Italy's top-drawer 'Denominazione di Origine Controllata' (DOC) rating. However, they are ranked one notch down the scale as table wines coming from a strictly defined geographical region. Even that may seem surprising to those who remember that the local white Valpolcevera was known for decades as the standard tipple for Genoa's thirsty dockers. 'Mornings would start with a swig of wine and continue in much the same way all day,' jokes Mr Capris. However, change is now on the cards for Genoa's local wine, as well as for Verminto di Ne and Bianco di Verici, two other local whites. Subject to a variety of approvals, including the European Commission, the local wines will eventually all be called Golfo del Tigullio, a name harking back to the inhabitants of the Gulf of Genoa in pre-Roman times. While wines from around La Spezia, including the Cinque Terre and the nearby Colli di Luni stretching south to Tuscany, account for around half Liguria's output, wines from areas to the west of Genoa form much of the remainder. The Rossesse di Dolceacqua DOC, produced in about five villages around Ventimiglia on the border with France, accounts for a fraction of that total. The red wines, similar to the well-known Barolo from Piedmont to the north, have been produced for centuries and are strong and mature quickly. But rather than seeking out obscure growths, visitors to Genoa would do well to remember the names of Pigato and Vermintino, two of Liguria's most commonly found wines, which make up the bulk of the output from the western Riviera. The two whites are 'classic Ligurian wines', says Mr Capris, light and fruity. 'Some experts even claim to detect a a hint of salt, brought in from the sea,' he adds, somewhat sceptically. Both wines, along with the less familiar red Rossesse, form part of the 'Riviera Ligure di Ponente' DOC, which is concentrated around Albenga. Surprisingly, little or no wine is produced from the shady valleys in the hinterland behind Genoa and the other coastal resorts. The relatively high altitude of the Apennines and the cool temperatures are the main culprits, although depopulation has also played a role. 'There were few people there before, and there are even fewer now,' notes Mr Capris. As in parts of the Cinque Terre, many smaller or less accessible vineyards have been abandoned or sold. The Italian legal system, which requires an estate to be split between all the heirs, has not helped, as holdings have been divided into increasingly small fractions over the years. And Liguria's harsh geography, with a lack of land which can be cultivated easily, has encouraged new owners to convert fields once devoted to wine to other, more profitable or essential, uses. Although a law now exists to give tax advantages to farmers amalgamating wine-growing plots, human interests often come into play. 'Ligurians are very individualistic. Even setting up the Cinque Terre co-operative was a herculean task,' says Mr Capris. The economic pressures on growers are particularly evident around Albenga, one of the few parts of Liguria where the coastal strip broadens out from a thin belt, sandwiched between the mountains and the sea, into a sizeable area of flat, easily arable land. Here, the competition is from horticulture, which is already dominant further to the west. Growing flowers is not only less labour intensive and more easily mechanised, but more profitable, too. Such factors mean Ligurian wine will always remain a speciality in Italy. The difficulties of growing vines in the region are reflected in the price of grapes, which, at around L2,000 a kilo, is almost three times as high as in neighbouring Piedmont. Those costs are naturally mirrored in the price of a bottle of Ligurian wine, which at around L8,000-L10,000, is above the Italian average. However, local growers are not despondent, particularly in view of the greater recognition they have received over the past 10-15 years. And for visitors who want to impress their Ligurian hosts, a gift of Sciaccetra, which weighs in at around L50,000-60,000 a bottle, should go down particularly well.</p>

			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / World Trade News: Brittan in call on telecoms SIR Leon Brittan, EC competition commissioner, yesterday urged the US to end restrictive procurement practices and open its telecommunications markets to European suppliers, Andrew Hill reports from Brussels. 'We are busy in the EC making sure our markets are open to competition. I call on our trading partners to do likewise,' Sir Leon told a New York conference on the future of world telecommunications. Telecoms procurement policy has been one bone of contention between the US and EC during the ongoing Gatt talks. The US threatened trade sanctions against the EC in February, claiming public procurement legislation due to come into force on January 1 would discriminate against non-EC suppliers.</p>

			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Letter: Small company audit plans lift burden and focus responsibility Sir, Perhaps I can set the mind of the outgoing president of the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants at rest - at least to some extent ('Move to cut audits attacked', May 8). We have consistently campaigned for measures that would ease the regulatory burden on small companies. One such measure would be to allow small proprietary companies to elect to dispense with a statutory audit, subject to suitable safeguards. Another, as recently floated by the Department of Trade and Industry, would be to create some abatement for those very small companies below the Pounds 36,600 turnover threshold for vat. At this turnover level, the current required fee for the full audit must be a significant proportion of a company's profit. We have therefore set up a working party to consider the latest suggestion from the DTI and the related issues arising from it. In doing so we are simply playing a part in moving towards an urgently needed new era of deregulation. Michael Groom, chairman, small company audits working party, Institute of Chartered Accountants, Moorgate Place, London EC2</p>

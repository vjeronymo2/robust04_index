			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Does charging shippers different prices for the same service under incremental pricing (vintage pricing) create economic distortions or undue discrimination, as raised by the Court in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> TransCanada <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ? Commenters should consider the following questions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. Does vintage pricing create economic distortions and, if so, are such distortions greater or less than those associated with rolled-in pricing?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Should existing shippers be entitled to receive lower prices because they signed long-term contracts with the pipelines when prices were lower? Commenters should address the terms and conditions relating to rate increases that would exist in long term contracts in a competitive market for capacity. They also should address the prices existing shippers should pay when their contracts expire.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. What price should a new shipper which acquires existing capacity (formerly priced at a pre-expansion rate) pay? For example, if an existing shipper exercises a contractual right to reduce its contract demand freeing capacity for a new shipper, should a new shipper pay the pre-expansion, the incremental, or some other rate for that freed-up capacity?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d. Are there methods of dealing with the vintage pricing issue? For example, should current shippers be able to release capacity prior to the expansion at up to the proposed incremental rate? If current shippers are willing to release some of their existing capacity prior to the expansion, the scale of the expansion could be reduced. Permitting current shippers to release capacity also would ensure that all shippers would make their capacity determinations based on incremental prices and that capacity would be allocated to those shippers valuing it the most.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. What Pricing Methodology Or Test Should The Commission Adopt For New And Existing Facilities?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Given the economic effects of the potential choices, the Commission is interested in obtaining comments on the pricing methodology or methodologies that should be used. Comments should not be limited to the rolled-in or incremental methodologies used in the past, but should include potential alternative approaches, with a discussion of the benefits of each approach. If the Commission were to continue its case-by-case approach to determining pricing methodology, the Commission is interested in obtaining comments on the appropriate test that should be used in making this determination. The following are some questions to be considered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. What does the industry need in the way of new construction over the next decade ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ., expansion of facilities, access to new market or supply areas, replacement of old facilities, connections between existing facilities to create greater flexibility) and how do these needs bear upon the methodology or methodologies used by the Commission to set rates for new construction? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Do changes in the industry warrant the adoption of a new approach to establishing pricing methodologies for new or existing construction? For example, are there relevant differences between current and past expansions in terms of the rate impact of the expansions or the customers served by the expansion ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ., all the pipeline's customers rather than a subset)? What effect does the advent of open access transportation and the unbundling of gas sales from transportation brought about by Order Nos. 436 and 636 have on the choice of pricing methodology?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. To what extent should other aspects of rate design ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ., unbundling, mileage-based rate design, seasonal rate design, production area rate design, or market based rates) affect the Commission's policy on the choice between rolled-in and incremental rates? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Should the Commission continue to use general criteria, such as the extent of system-wide benefits, or should it adopt discrete policies or guidelines for determining the appropriate methodologies. The following are some possible options to be considered. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. Different methodologies could be used depending on the type of construction, for example mainline expansions, laterals, extensions beyond the existing termination point, or facilities directly connected to certain customers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Thresholds could be set for determining which methodology to apply, for example, rolling-in costs for facilities unless they would increase rates by more than a certain percentage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. Rates for expansion customers could be set at the higher of rolled-in or incremental rates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / International Company News: Porsche details fund-raising The planned capital increase for Porsche, aimed at raising DM200m (Dollars 118m) to help fund new sports car developments, is to take the form of a one-for-four rights issue at DM575 a share. The subscription period for the 350,000 new shares, half ordinary and half preferred stock with a nominal value of DM17.5m, will run from March 22 to April 7. The new shares will be eligible for 50 per cent of any dividend payable for the financial year ending on July 31. The offer follows approval at the annual meeting in January of a proposal to increase the company's capital by up to DM20m. The new ordinary stock is already destined for the Porsche and Piech families, which own all existing voting shares, and have shown no inclination to relinquish absolute control. They are also understood to own 40 per cent of outstanding preference shares. The company, which last year lost almost DM240m, and has previously said it expects a further deficit this year of around DM150m, after a shortfall of DM115m at the half-year, has confidently forecast a return to profits in 1994/95 and 'decent' earnings the following year. By then it expects to have two new models on the market to bolster a range which at present depends heavily on the 911 series. The company has estimated its investment needs at DM1bn until the end of the 1996/97 year. Further details of the company's prospects are expected on Monday at the public launch of the rights issue by the lead manager, Dresdner Bank. See Lex</p>

			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / International Company News: Compaq impresses with 88% jump in third term Compaq Computer lived up to high expectations with an 88 per cent jump in net income for the third quarter, achieved on a sales increase of 63 per cent. Net income for the quarter was Dollars 201m, up from Dollars 107m in the third quarter of 1993. Earnings per share rose 79 per cent to 75 cents, compared with 42 cents in the same period last year. Revenues increased to Dollars 2.84bn from Dollars 1.75bn. Sales growth was strong worldwide, the company said. North American sales grew by 57 per cent, Europe by 50 per cent and Japan, Latin America and Asia-Pacific sales grew at a combined rate of 122 per cent. More than half of Compaq's sales are in North America. During the quarter, Compaq continued its expansion by beginning production at new facilities in Jaguarina, Brazil, and Shenzhen, China. This week the company announced plans to establish a sales and marketing subsidiary in South Africa. Third-quarter gross margin declined to 23 per cent from 26.5 per cent in the second quarter, but the drop was anticipated due to aggressive price cuts. Mr Eckhard Pfeiffer, president and chief executive, said he expected to maintain this level of profit margins for the remainder of the year and 1995. He has set a target for Compaq to be the worldwide PC industry leader by 1996. By most measures, however, this goal has already been achieved with Compaq outselling its largest competitors, IBM and Apple Computer, for the year to date. Mr Gian Carlo Bison, senior vice-president for North American marketing, declined to comment on a legal dispute between Intel and Advanced Micro Devices, Compaq's two suppliers of microprocessor chips, that threatens to interrupt AMD's production. He said, however, that Compaq was talking to 'a variety of potential suppliers' of microprocessors. For the year to date, net income rose to Dollars 624m, or Dollars 3.11, against Dollars 311m, or Dollars 1.22. Revenues advanced to Dollars 7.6bn from Dollars 5bn in the first nine months of 1993.</p>

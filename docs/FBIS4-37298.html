			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [YONHAP report from Jerusalem] </F>   [Text] Na'im Asher, Israeli ambassador to the ROK,  expressed worry over the fact that North Korea is selling  long-range Scud missiles to Middle East countries, such as  Syria, Iran, and Libya.    In an interview with an Israeli radio station, Ambassador  Asher expressed worry by saying that Israel has had a bad  experience with North Korea, which is selling dangerous Scud  missiles to Middle East countries.    Ambassador Asher pointed out that in the past Israel  contacted North Korea to stop its export of weapons to the  Middle East region, but realized Israel lacked the capability to  persuade North Korea. He said that U.S. efforts to apply  sanctions against the North take Israel's interests into account.</p>

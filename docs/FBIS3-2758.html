			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Shenzhen, March 7 (CNS) -- Vice Minister of the  State Commission for Restructuring the Economy, Mr. Wu Jie,  recently made an inspection tour of Zhuhai and Shenzhen where he  said that scientific management over the economy in these  special economic zones was the vital key to their build-up.    There were still many arduous tasks facing these zones, Mr.  Wu said, such as the transfer of government functions,  construction of legislation and the operation of the market  economy. The personnel system still was not able to meet the  demands of the market economy and spiritual civilization also  faced a long-time task. These zones, therefore, had to exercise  scientific management in order to meet the demands of the market  economy.    Reform and work in various sectors in these zones, he said,  should go forward at the same pace. For example, emphasis  should not be only placed on a single item but should be put on  the coordination of industrial structure and its promotion; it  should not only be put on the economic build-up but on reform  for the administrative system as well as the construction of  morality, culture and ideology and not only on the introduction  of foreign capital and opening to the outside world but on the  restructuring of the economy.    Relevant departments and their staff should, Mr. Wu said,  make full use of all the policies implemented in such zones,  striving for realization of the strategic goals set for the  zones by Deng Xiaoping.</p>

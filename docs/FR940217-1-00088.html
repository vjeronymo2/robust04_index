			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under these proposed regulations, the Secretary would follow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the fine proceedings contained in 34 CFR part 668, subpart G, in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imposing a fine against a third-party servicer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 682.414&blank;Records, reports, and inspection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements for guaranty agency programs.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposes to amend this section to make a third-party servicer's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibilities under this part conform to currently existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations with respect to a guaranty agency's obligation to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintain current records. Under this provision, a third-party  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicer acting as an agent for a guaranty agency would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to maintain current, complete, and accurate records for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all loans that it services for that agency. These records would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have to be updated at least once every 10 business days. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary is proposing this provision to ensure that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third-party servicer with which a guaranty agency contracts is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsible for maintaining accurate records.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 682.416&blank;Requirements for third-party servicers and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lenders contracting with third-party servicers.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposes to add a new section to the FFEL program regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that would set forth administrative and financial standards that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a third-party servicer would be required to meet in order to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an eligible third-party servicer with which a lender or guaranty  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency may contract for purposes of its responsibilities under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the FFEL programs. Under these proposed regulations, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third-party servicer would be considered to be administratively  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsible if it provides the services for which it has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contracted to perform in accordance with the Federal laws and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations that govern the FFEL programs, has business systems  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that are capable of meeting those requirements and has adequate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> personnel who are knowledgeable about the FFEL programs. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary is proposing these standards because he believes that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these are the minimum administrative standards that an agent or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entity must meet to demonstrate satisfactorily to the Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that it is capable of performing FFEL program services in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accordance with applicable statutes and regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary proposes to apply the standards governing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financial responsibility under 34 CFR 668.13(c), (d), (g), and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h), governing the financial responsibility of institutions and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third-party servicers contracting with those institutions, to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third-party servicer that administers any aspect of the FFEL  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs under a contract with a guaranty agency or lender, for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purposes of this part.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During the negotiated rulemaking sessions, the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards governing financial responsibility of third-party  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicers and institutions generated disagreement among the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> negotiators. The Secretary intends that the financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibility standards in this section would parallel, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable, similar standards of financial responsibility for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participating institutions that the Secretary intends to publish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in proposed regulations to be published shortly after these.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When published, this future NPRM will provide commenters with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opportunity to comment on financial responsibility standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> governing both third-party servicers and institutions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary proposes these standards to ensure that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third-party servicer would not be able to maintain a contract  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with a lender or guaranty agency to administer any aspect of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lender's or guaranty agency's FFEL program unless that servicer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> periodically demonstrates to the Secretary the ability to meet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its financial obligations with that lender or guaranty agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, these standards would ensure that the servicer can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrate that it is financially stable and will be able to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meet these obligations in the future. The Secretary believes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that these standards are necessary because the financial failure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of a third-party servicer could have an enormous impact on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FFEL programs that could create substantial losses for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal taxpayer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under these proposed rules, the Secretary would, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined necessary, conduct a special review of a third-party  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicer to determine if it meets the administrative capability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and financial responsibility standards proposed in this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the Secretary conducts that review, the servicer would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to provide evidence to the Secretary that it meets these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards. Based on the review of the materials required by this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section the Secretary could initiate a limitation, suspension, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> termination action against the servicer. If the servicer is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unable to demonstrate that it meets the established standards for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative capability and financial responsibility, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicer could provide evidence to the Secretary demonstrating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the limitation, suspension, or termination action is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unwarranted. This latter provision was added at the request of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> negotiators to govern situations where a third-party servicer may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not be able to meet the defined standards proposed in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section, but the servicer still considers itself to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administratively capable and financially responsible. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision would allow a third-party servicer the opportunity to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrate to the Secretary that it is still administratively  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capable and financially responsible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This section would provide that a third-party servicer is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not financially responsible under this section if the servicer,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or the servicer's owner, majority shareholder, or chief executive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> officer is determined to have a questionable past performance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The past performance criteria in this section would parallel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed requirements under 34 CFR 668.12 (implementing statutory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements governing the past performance of persons or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organizations associated with institutions that participate in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title IV, HEA programs) and under 34 CFR 668.82 (governing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard of conduct of institutions and third-party servicers for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purposes of the Title IV, HEA programs). Furthermore, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary proposes to apply this provision to any person employed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the servicer or any person, entity, or any officer or employee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of an entity that the servicer contracts with whose past  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance is also questionable. In addition, in order to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remain financially responsible, if a third-party servicer learns  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of such a conviction or determination, the servicer would have to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> take immediate action to safeguard the Title IV, HEA programs, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> explained previously in the discussion concerning &sect;668.82. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] San Cristobal de Las Casas, Mexico, 1 Feb (AFP) --  Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho announced in this city on  Tuesday the creation of two "buffer zones" on Wednesday in the  towns of San Miguel and Guadalupe Tepeyac, Chiapas State to  "create detente areas" following the armed conflict.    Camacho read a communique to the media which stated that  free  access will be allowed to two "buffer zones" in Ocosingo and Las  Margaritas "as long as weapons are not carried."    San Miguel and Guadalupe Tepeyac are villages located far  from San Cristobal and to which the Army has never had access  during the conflict because of local guerrilla resistance.    Camacho also said that armed members of the Zapatist  National  Liberation Army (EZLN), which began a military uprising in  southern Mexico on 1 January, should not be present in the area,  either.    Camacho, who announced a series of actions in support of the  "life and dignity" of the people in Chiapas, did not talk about  the possibility of a dialogue with the rebels, which remains at  a standstill.    The communique read by Camacho and addressed to the EZLN  General Command said "these will be the first two buffer zones"  to be established in the state, and he added that "the Mexican  Army from its positions will offer facilities for the movement  of residents, supplies, and medicines to each one of these  villages."    "The Mexican Army has already left all areas where it had a  presence in Chiapas State," said Camacho in his message to the  guerrillas.    He said that "traffic will be allowed through the access  routes" to the buffer zone towns "as long as no weapons are  carried." He added that the perimeters proposed for these  places "must be respected."    "In these areas there must be no armed presence of the  EZLN,"  stated the commissioner, and added that the Mexican Red Cross  will provide in both towns "humanitarian health services and  will assist with supplies."    Camacho added that "everyone will receive health care," but  "only the civilian population" will receive supplies.    Camacho said the services provided at the two places will  consist of health brigades to fight malaria and cholera, to  provide universal vaccinations and first aid, and to support the  transportation of patients to hospitals in Chiapas State or in  other places in the country in the cases that may so require.    Regarding the supplies, the commissioner announced that  warehouse and distribution centers for supplying the civilian  population will be "gradually" installed and that humanitarian  organizations may support the effort in coordination with the  Red Cross. He added that the effort "will have full public and  private support."    "With these actions, we all support the life and dignity of  individuals over all forceful actions and military presence,"  the commissioner stressed.</p>

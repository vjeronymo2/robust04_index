			<p><P> April 14, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> NASA REPLACES PART ON SHUTTLE, REVIEWS LAUNCH  </P> <P> Technicians replaced a faulty engine part Thursday aboard the shuttle Atlantis,  as NASA managers reviewed plans to launch the spacecraft at the end of the  month on a crucial flight to deploy a probe to Venus.  </P> <P> The two-day "flight readiness review," an exhaustive assessment of shuttle  launch processing, began at 8 a.m. at the space center and ran late into the  day.  </P> <P> Among those present was Navy Rear Adm. Richard H. Truly, a former astronaut and  associate administrator for space flight whom President Bush said Wednesday he  would nominate to serve as NASA's next administrator.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Probe to Map Venus  </P> <P> Atlantis is scheduled to blast off April 28 with a crew of five to launch the  Magellan probe, which will continue on a 15-month voyage to Venus. Magellan is  scheduled to map at least 90% of the planet's surface, which would increase  knowledge about the evolution of Earth's solar system.  </P> <P> The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's shuttle processing schedule  does not include additional time to resolve problems, which is what engineers  encountered Wednesday night.  </P></p>

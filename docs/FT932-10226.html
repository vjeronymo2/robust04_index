			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / Balladur prepares to impose tax-raising budget on France MR EDOUARD Balladur, the French prime minister, will today put his stamp on economic policy with a special budget aimed at stemming the rising budget deficit by raising taxes. He will also seek to boost the stalled economy through selective public works spending. After only five weeks in office, Mr Balladur is using his political honeymoon to impose unpopular tax increases on an electorate which voted massively for a centre-right platform that spoke of fiscal sacrifice only in very general terms. A cabinet meeting today will also table plans to make the French central bank independent, another election promise. The aim is to curb political interference in the exercise of monetary policy and reduce the likelihood of fresh speculative attacks against the franc. The government-ordered audit of state finances last week paved the way for budgetary austerity. It estimated that, without corrective action, the central budget deficit would rise from FFr226bn (Pounds 27bn) last year to around FFr340bn this year. The separate welfare funds for unemployment, health, pensions and family allowances could end this year some FFr135bn in the red. The overwhelming reason for the slide in public finances is the slowdown in the economy which, the audit commission estimated, could contract by about 0.5 per cent this year. There has also been a consequent rise in unemployment to 10.7 per cent. The most controversial measure is expected to be a rise in the 'general social contribution' (CSG) from 1.1 per cent to 2.4 per cent on salaries, bringing in a gross FFr20bn this year. Mr Balladur apparently believes a CSG hike would do less harm to economic growth than raising value added tax. But in deference to conservative distaste for the CSG, introduced by the Socialists, he may make the increased payment deductible from income tax. The equivalent of excise tax on petrol and alcohol is also expected to rise. Mr Balladur is expected to confirm today that the period during which individuals contribute to full state pensions is to be lengthened gradually from 37 1/2 to 40 years, another unpopular move. Mr Edmond Alphandery, minister of the economy, said in an interview with the Financial Times that the budget would take initial steps towards giving individuals a tax break on their long-term savings. He said this, in addition to the effect of recent short-term interest rate cuts, would encourage the flow of money into the stock market, essential to his ambitious privatisation programme. Mr Balladur has promised to pare spending by FFr20bn, with cuts expected to fall on defence and education. Some of this saving will be used to provide tax incentives for the beleaguered construction industry and to finance public housing. Monday Interview, Page 32</p>

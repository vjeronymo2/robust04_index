			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Food retailers busy Leading food retail stocks took centre stage yesterday, making strong advances as a number of factors acted on the sector. BZW was prominent among these, the investment bank issuing a positive note on the sector which argued that the recent weakness in some stocks made them look good value. Among them were J. Sainsbury and Wm Morrison Supermarkets, which rose 7 to 378p and 2 to 123p respectively. Elsewhere, there was talk of a large US hedge fund buy order being tidied up in the sector, as well as more general interest from cyclical funds coming into consumer stocks. Tesco advanced 4 to 215p and Argyll gained 10 at 238p. Profit-taking and a more sober consideration of its Dollars 2.3bn acquisition of Diversified Pharmaceuticals saw SmithKline Beecham 'A' retrace 16 to 399p. Most analysts welcomed the deal but some, including Lehman Brothers, the US investment bank, are concerned at the increased risks prompted by the trend for consolidation. The house adjusted its 1994 forecast by Pounds 40m to Pounds 1.235bn to take into account the anticipated earnings dilution resulting from the deal. Elsewhere, Glaxo, which is seen as one of the most likely UK companies to follow the lead set by Merck, of the US, and SmithKline, retreated 17 to 571p. Wellcome held up against the trend as it was announced that the US Food and Drug Administration had granted limited approval for the company's lung cancer treatment Navelbine. However, analysts said the approval was only an interim measure ahead of an impending decision by the FDA and made no material difference. The shares closed 3 better at 550p. Tobacco and insurance conglomerate BAT Industries saw its shares turn around from a gain of 11 to a closing net fall of 4 at 455p. The shares responded more to concern over the dollar than to first-quarter profits of Pounds 424m, up from Pounds 354m previously. The latest quarterly output figures from RTZ helped shares in the world's biggest mining group rise 4 to 844p. Copper and iron ore output had improved, the group said. Another impressive monthly new subscriber performance by Vodafone, the UK's leading mobile phones group, saw the stock move up 3 to 545 1/2 p. The latest steep fall on the Hong Kong market produced further big losses in the Far Eastern-influenced banks. HSBC fell 10 more to 669p and has now dropped almost 40 per cent from its February 4 high point of Pounds 11. Standard Chartered, off 23 at 936p, was additionally unsettled by the oft-repeated story that Lloyds Bank is about to unload its 4.7 per cent stake in Standard, the legacy of its failed bid to take over the bank in the 1980s. Yesterday's rumour suggested that the stock would be placed at a 10 per cent discount to the ruling market price. The stake sale story is one of the longest running in the market and was shrugged off by dealers and bank specialists alike. Lloyds dropped 16 to 559p. BP outpaced the rest of the oils, with a number of UK institutions said to be keen to build positions ahead of first-quarter figures expected around 11.30am today. The shares closed a penny firmer at 383p after 7.5m traded. Analysts expected more good news from BP on reduced costs, an area in which the oil company has made startling progress in the past two years. Shell lost 7 at 706p in turnover of 3.8m following switching into BP. Burmah Castrol moved up 6 to 850p ahead of a presentation to analysts on May 27. Reports that Channel Tunnel operator Eurotunnel may ask bankers to refinance existing borrowings hit the stock just days before the tunnel's official opening. The shares dropped 26 to 468p. A sharp increase in full-year figures boosted Danka Business, 5 higher at 335p. Trading between BTR's ordinary shares and warrants brought closing volume in the ordinary stock of 8.6m as the price shed 7 to 387p with the market. James Dickie relinquished 18 to 145p after an announcement that the chief executive had reduced his holding in the company to 28.5 per cent. Trading news and results from two of the food manufacturing sector's biggest companies prompted slides in the share prices, although turnover was surprisingly thin. Unilever retreated 18 to 1049p on volume of just over 800,000 shares following remarks made by Sir Michael Perry, the chairman, who said economic conditions in 1994 were likely to be uneven and patchy. He also railed against own label retailers whose product designs ape those of the brand producers. Analysts said the remarks underlined the seriousness of the threat to branded products by supermarket own label goods. Results from Tate &amp; Lyle came in ahead of market expectations, which had been tempered by last September's profits warning. However, news of the acquisition of a loss-making French food ingredient group hit sentiment and the shares slid 8 to 434p on turnover of 1.7m.

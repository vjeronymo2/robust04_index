			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Solomons without a premier The Solomon Islands was without a prime minister yesterday after Mr Francis Billy Hilly resigned 18 days after refusing to step down when sacked by the governor-general. 'I have decided it is finally time to allow for a change in the leadership of the government,' Mr Hilly told parliament in the capital, Honiara. It is unclear who will become the new prime minister. The former prime minister (now opposition leader) Mr Solomon Mamaloni had been sworn in as a caretaker premier on October 25. But it was unclear if Mr Mamaloni's caretaker role remained valid following Mr Hilly's resignation. Governor-General Moses Pitakaka was yet to make a statement on Mr Hilly's resignation, and is now expected to call for nominations. Political analysts say Mr Hilly's stance against alleged exploitation of tropical forests by foreign logging companies had caused his loss of support. His resignation ended almost three weeks of political crisis, which at times meant the country had two prime ministers.</p>

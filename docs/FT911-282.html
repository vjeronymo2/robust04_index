			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / Tories plan VAT rise says Smith: Increase in rate to 22 per cent said to be on taxation 'hidden agenda' LABOUR WENT on the offensive over tax and spending policy yesterday by raising the spectre of a Tory 'hidden agenda' to increase value added tax should the Conservatives be returned to office after a general election. In an assault on the Tories' record, Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, accused the government of 'sheer hypocrisy' in claiming to have lowered taxation when the total tax burden, taking in National Insurance and VAT, had risen from 34.75 per cent in 1978-79 to 37.75 per cent in 1990-91. Defending the government's achievements, Mr David Mellor, the chief secretary to the Treasury, once again asked how Labour would raise public spending by Pounds 20bn without increasing taxes. The new skirmishing over taxation came as all the parties were manoeuvring for maximum advantage before Thursday's by-election in Monmouth, where the Tories are defending a 9,000 majority. In spite of the efforts of Tory leaders to stamp out speculation over a June general election some Conservatives still believe a good result in the seat might bolster the case for an early poll. Prior to a week-long programme of speeches to businessmen in Manchester, Leeds and Birmingham, Mr Smith raised the VAT issue in his address to the Banking, Insurance and Finance Union in Blackpool. He warned that if Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, were to fulfil his promise to lower basic tax rates to 20p in the pound he would either have to cut public spending or shift the burden to another tax, probably VAT. Labour has calculated that to fund a 5p cut in basic rate income tax the Tories would have to increase VAT from 17.5 per cent to 22 per cent. Officials pointed out that the Tories had shifted the tax burden to indirect taxation when Sir Geoffrey Howe raised VAT from 8 per cent to 15 per cent, shortly after denying any such plans at the preceding election. Mr Mellor said in a BBC interview that there was no conflict between lowering taxes and increasing public expenditure. 'The record shows we have been able to strike a balance', he said, adding that Labour had yet to show how it would 'outbid' the government on spending without tax increases.</p>

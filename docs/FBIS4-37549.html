			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Tehran, 21 Jun (KUNA) -- Ayatollah Muhammad Baqir  al-Hakim, chairman of the Supreme Assembly of the Islamic  Revolution in Iraq [SAIRI] expressed his conviction in Tehran  today that the Iraqi regime was involved in the Mashhad  explosion which led to the killing and injuring of many Iranian  and foreign visitors.    In a message of condolence to the leader of the Islamic  Revolution, al-Hakim said: I believe that the fascist regime has  had a hand in the barbaric and cruel attack on the visitors to  the shrine.    He added: This great crime reminds us of the barbaric acts  perpetrated by Saddam's regime and his criminal and two-faced  allies; be it the killing of the participants in the Friday  prayers in Tehran or attacking the holy shrines in Karbala and  Najaf in Iraq and the killing of thousands of people mercilessly.

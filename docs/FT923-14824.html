			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / Leading Article: Canny reforms SO FAR, so good. The plans announced on Friday by Mr Michael Heseltine to reshape the Department of Trade and Industry are modest and sensible. British business, which for years has complained that its interests were never taken into account in the process of government decision making, should be pleased by a reorganisation which will relate the DTI more closely to individual sectors of industry. New divisions within the department will develop specific areas of expertise, will encourage civil servants to broaden their horizons, and will bring in experts from the private sector to help develop rigorous analysis and sound business judgments. Those who fear that Mr Heseltine has a private agenda, aimed at a much greater degree of government intervention in business, should also be reassured by this announcement. Far from building a mighty empire, he speaks demurely about a cut in the department's overall budget. The new sectoral divisions, he says, will be no soft touch: they will sponsor their particular industries, but not in an uncritical way. The aim is to improve communications and understanding, rather than to provide a series of focal points for Whitehall whingeing. Mr Heseltine has yet to show his hand on the most important aspects of industrial policy, especially where it concerns competition, and his critics still assume that he has something up his sleeve. Has he changed his game, or is he just being canny?</p>

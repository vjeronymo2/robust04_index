			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Sugar deficit put at 1.8m tonnes The world faces another deficit year in sugar supplies after a worsening in prospects for this year's crop, according to the latest report by ED &amp; F. Man, the UK commodities house. Sugar production is forecast to be 110.7m tonnes for the next crop year (1994-1995) leaving a shortfall of 1.8m tonnes. World supplies are tight after the unloading of stocks in the current crop year when production of 109.03m tonnes led to a deficit of 2.2m tonnes. The two deficit years come after 12 years' of production surpluses with supply tightness pushing prices higher. A poor crop in China and difficulties in Cuba combined with India's desire to increase imports and rebuild stocks could push prices higher. China's cane crop has been damaged by flooding. Man's estimate for Cuba's crop next year is 3.5m tonnes.</p>

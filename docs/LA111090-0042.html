			<p><P> November 10, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> RAMS MAY BE BAD, BUT CAN EDDIE DOUCETTE CALL A DECENT GAME?  </P> <P> Now that Phoenix and Arizona have lost their Super Bowl, and rightly so, the  NFL is thinking about awarding said Super Bowl to San Diego. In my mind that's  pretty funny.  </P> <P> San Diego is one of a few major cities that has refused to name a major street  after Martin Luther King Jr. Whenever it is proposed that anything be named  after Dr. King in our city, the racistsrise in mass protest and you will notice  that Dr. King or his legacy are not really very evident in "America's Finest  City."  </P> <P> Is there any doubt that if a similar election were held in San Diego County to  recognize Dr. King's birthday as a holiday, that it would go down to defeat  just as it did in Arizona? For San Diego to be awarded the Super Bowl because  of Arizona's lack of respect for Dr. King is a joke.  </P> <P> BILL TAPP, San Diego  </P></p>

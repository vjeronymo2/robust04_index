			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Gas boss's pay 'adds Pounds 1.6m to pension cost' The Pounds 205,000 pay rise recently awarded to Mr Cedric Brown, chief executive of British Gas, has increased the cost of providing him with a company pension by about Pounds 1.6m, according to a study. Mr Bryn Davies, an actuary who advises trade unions on company pension schemes, said the current value of Mr Brown's future pension payments was Pounds 3.9m, compared with Pounds 2.3m before he received the 75 per cent rise in basic pay. Mr Davies said: 'The value of his expected pension, like his pay, has gone up by more than 70 per cent. I have calculated that his pay increase has pushed the worth of his pension benefits up by a further Pounds 1.6m.' Details of Mr Brown's pay rise emerged last week. His basic pay has been increased to Pounds 475,000 from Pounds 270,000. Other executive directors of British Gas received rises of up to 50 per cent. Mr Brown is a member of the British Gas staff pension scheme which provides pensions depending on members' earnings just before they retire. Mr Davies's calculations assume that Mr Brown, 59, will retire in just over two years' time. British Gas said that he had at least 35 years' pension scheme service. Mr Brown contributes 4 per cent of his basic salary into the scheme each year, so his Pounds 205,000 pay rise means he will be paying more into the pension fund. Asked to comment on Mr Davies's calculations, British Gas said yesterday that Mr Brown was a member of 'a group pension scheme with a common contribution rate so we do not define the costs for individuals'. Sir Anthony Beaumont-Dark, chairman of TR High Income Trust which holds 400,000 British Gas shares, said he would be writing to British Gas asking for an explanation for the increased pension costs. He said: 'If we do not get a satisfactory response then we will consider using our votes in the appropriate manner at the company's annual general meeting.' Trade union officials representing industrial workers at British Gas have submitted a claim for a pay rise next year. Mr Donald Macgregor, a senior GMB union official, said yesterday that it was likely that Mr Brown's pay would affect of negotiations. He said: 'It is inconceivable that such over-the-top treatment for a chief executive can be ignored by industrial employees.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Kenichi Ito from the "Seiron" column: "Even If </F> We Prohibit the Use of Nuclear Weapons, We Will Not Solve the  Problem"]    [Text]Difference Between Arguments for Enacting,  Interpreting Law    In response to the question from the International Court of  Justice (ICJ) -- "Is a nation's use of nuclear weapons a  violation under international law?" -- the Japanese Government  at first planned to submit the following written statement:  "Speaking from a purely legal point of view... one cannot say  that it is a violation of today's positive international law.  Due to the tremendous destructive and killing power of nuclear  weapons, however, we believe that their use is not in accord  with the spirit of humanitarianism that is the basis of  international law." However, there arose a chorus of opposition  from all over Japan voicing such reactions as, "The statement is  not in accord with the popular sentiments of the only nation to  suffer from atomic bombing." The government then submitted its  written statement after removing the part "Speaking from a  purely legal point of view... one cannot say that it is a  violation."    What should we make of this? ASAHI SHIMBUN's 7 June  editorial called the government's position "heartless."  MAINICHI SHIMBUN's 8 June editorial criticized the Foreign  Ministry: "One can only call the response that of legal  gangsters." Certainly, one can understand how the written  statement that "one cannot say that the use of nuclear weapons  is a violation" does not square with the popular sentiment of  Japanese who, having experienced the bombing of Hiroshima and  Nagasaki, have since taken the lead in implementing the three  nonnuclear principles, and appealed to the world for disarmament  and the abolition of nuclear weapons. The immediate reaction of  the people in this way, too, can certainly be considered a sound  response. However, the nature of the nuclear problem is a  complicated one. The people did not react after understanding  the big picture and giving it dispassionate and mature  consideration. Explaining the problem rationally to the people  should remain the task of specialists and political leaders. Of  course, diplomacy divorced from popular sentiment will not last.  But it is also true that diplomacy errs in simply following  popular sentiment.    The editorials from ASAHI SHIMBUN and MAINICHI SHIMBUN  themselves admit that "perhaps there is no treaty or agreement  in which it is expressly written that the use of nuclear weapons  is a legal violation" (ASAHI), and that "the fact is that there  is almost certainly no international law or regulation  prohibiting the use of nuclear weapons" (MAINICHI). Therefore,  the argument becomes one for enacting a law: "If nonuse of  nuclear weapons is not prescribed by international law, then it  should be prescribed in accord with the times" (ASAHI). The  problem the ICJ raised is an argument of interpretation.  Therefore, ASAHI and MAINICHI have substituted the first type  of argument for the second. If they had answered the problem  squarely, ASAHI and MAINICHI would have had to say that, "One  cannot say that the use of nuclear weapons is against the law."  However, those taking the position that depends on the argument  for enacting a law so that "the use of nuclear weapons is  against the law" probably also wished to say "it is against the  law" in the argument of interpretation as well. However, that  is like the 17th-century Roman Catholic pope who demanded that  Galileo accept the Ptolemaic theory that the sun revolves around  the earth. Perhaps the Foreign Ministry officials are murmuring,  "Even so, it is the earth that is revolving around the sun."  <H5>  Hiroshima, Nagasaki Bombings Were Violations of </H5> International Law    Of course, saying "one cannot say it is against the law"  does  not mean that one can therefore legally use nuclear weapons at  any time and any place. In a war of aggression, the war itself  is against the law, and thus so not only are nuclear weapons but  the use of all weapons. The problem is that even for cases in  which a war is legal (for example, in exercising the right to  self-defense or in the military measures taken by the United  Nations), the use of certain weapons is outlawed. The question  is whether nuclear weapons are among them. In the balance  between military effectiveness and humanitarian considerations,  the call to prohibit the use of certain weapons comes when the  latter consideration dominates (i.e., when suffering considered  unnecessary is inflicted by the use of certain weapons despite  there being other means to achieve the same military effect).  Thus, the St. Petersburg Declaration of 1868 outlawed the use  of explosives under 400 grams while not outlawing the use of  those above 400 grams. Even if we were to ignore military  effectiveness and outlaw the use of certain weapons on the  grounds of humanitarianism alone, the act would actually have no  effect. All weapons are basically inhumane. Speaking from a  strictly humane point of view, the use of all weapons should be  prohibited.    Incidentally, I believe the atomic bombing of Hiroshima  and Nagasaki by the United States was illegal under  international law. However, my reasoning is not that the use of  the atomic bombs was itself illegal (dropping an atomic bomb on  the battleship Yamato under way at sea would have been  completely legal) but that the act strayed from the principle of  military targeting. The bombing was illegal as an  indiscriminate attack upon a defenseless city, resulting in many  casualties among peaceful citizens. In that sense, although  atomic bombs were not used, the massive air raid against Tokyo  on 10 March 1945 was an eminent violation of international law.  <H5>  Inescapable Problem of Nuclear Deterrence </H5>   However, the destructive and killing power of nuclear  weapons  is tremendous. A situation in which they would be used again is  absolutely inexcusable for whatever reason. Turning at this  point to the argument for enacting a law, it is natural for  Japan, which maintains its three nonnuclear principles, to work  to outlaw the use of nuclear weapons. However, precisely  because we would not resolve all the issues in creating such a  treaty, the problem is truly complicated. To what extent do  Japanese understand this? The history of international  relations is one of broken treaties. The real issue is creating  an international management system to guarantee the  implementation of the agreements. Then, for that to happen, we  cannot escape from the problem of nuclear deterrence. Therein  lies the true difficulty of this problem.</p>

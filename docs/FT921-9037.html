			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Compact discs go on record THE compact disc revolution has taken the music industry by storm, but music lovers are still waiting for the day when they will be able to record their favourite tunes on their own, in digital sound, writes Michiyo Nakamoto. Plasmon, a Cambridge-based manufacturer of optical discs such as CDs, is entering the market for recordable CDs in a joint development agreement with Ciba-Geigy, the Swiss chemical company. The UK-Swiss team believes it has a more stable chemical which can be used to coat CDs and make them recordable as well as give them a life expectancy of up to 50 years. Each disc would be recordable only once. Ciba-Geigy will provide the chemical know-how while Plasmon will be the engineering and production vehicle. The two companies expect to start shipping samples in June and to go into production by the end of this year. Apart from recording music, recordable CDs have a range of applications from photo-CD to data storage. Plasmon: UK, 0763 261466.</p>

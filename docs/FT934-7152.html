			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Motoring: The big cat that got away - Stuart Marshall tries out the futuristic Lexus and is impressed / Test drive THE LEXUS GS300 is the kind of car Jaguar must produce one day. It is sporty yet urbane, dignified but not stuffy. The soft leather and wood veneered interior is good taste personified. Something like it could, in fact, have been a Jaguar. At Geneva motor show in March 1990, the Italian stylist Giorgietto Giugiaro exhibited a concept car called Kensington. This curvy four-door saloon had a Jaguar V12's mechanicals. Jaguar looked it over carefully but reckoned it was not quite the kind of thing their customers should have. Toyota - Lexus is its up-market brand - also studied Kensington and was rather more impressed, deciding to make it the basis of its classy Aristo three-litre luxury saloon. Essentially the same car has just reached Britain as the Lexus GS300. It looks quite a bit smaller than the original Lexus LS400, the sepulchrally silent V8 that has seduced some Britons - and a great many Americans - out of their BMW 7-Series and Mercedes S-Class saloons. But appearances deceive. The Lexus GS300 is only a couple of inches shorter than an LS400, bigger than a Mercedes E-Class or BMW 5-Series and almost identical in size to a Jaguar XJ-6. Its three-litre, 209 horsepower straight six is the same engine that powers the new Toyota Supra but without the twin turbochargers. Like the high-class European cars it has been aimed at, GS300 has rear-wheel drive and standard automatic transmission. Unlike most of them, it comes with absolutely everything a business motorist could wish for. The Pounds 31,950 price includes air conditioning, power adjusted and heated front seats, cruise control, leather trim, driver and passenger airbags, autochange CD player and a powered tilt-and-telescope steering wheel. Ignition key out, the wheel raises itself and move forward to make getting in and out easier. Put the key in and the wheel resumes its pre-set position. It goes beautifully. The suspension is just a little firmer than that of the Lexus LS400 and you are more aware of the kind of surface the 55-series Bridgestone tyres are rolling on. At British motorway speeds wind noise is negligible. You hear the engine only when accelerating hard enough for the transmission to hold second to over 50 mph (80 kph) and third to well over 70 mph (112 kph). I see the G300 more as an alternative to a BMW 530 than a Mercedes-Benz E-Class or a Jaguar XJ-6. It is a difficult point to put into words but it lacks the gravitas that appeals to Mercedes and Jaguar (and for that matter, Bentley) buyers. For younger people this is, of course, a plus. For the size of car, rear-seat space is adequate rather than generous; the boot is wide and deep enough to swallow easily two golf bags in their trolleys; and the GS300 has the best headlights I have ever driven behind.</p>

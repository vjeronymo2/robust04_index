			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / UK Company News: MTM in talks with SFO over shortfall MTM, the speciality chemicals company that saw its share price collapse last year, has confirmed that it is co-operating with a Serious Fraud Office investigation into the circumstances surrounding the shortfall in its 1991 profits. The company said it was 'co-operating fully with the SFO and the North Yorkshire police in an investigation being carried out concerning matters relating to that shortfall.' Mr Richard Lines, the founder and chairman of MTM, resigned from the company in March last year after two profit warnings within the space of one week. Soon after taking over as chief executive, Mr Ken Schofield said MTM had forwarded a report by auditors Binder Hamlyn to the SFO. The report revealed transactions that were 'incorrectly recorded' in 1991 and the previous year which had boosted sales and possibly profits, Mr Schofield said. After seeing the report the SFO had originally said it did not believe the matter warranted its attention. MTM was announcing a breakthrough in its refinancing arrangements. The group's banks have agreed to convert Pounds 40m of its Pounds 100m debt into 80 per cent of the enlarged ordinary equity of the group at a price of 11p per share. The proposals would include provision of three years banking facilities to MTM. MTM will announce a full refinancing proposal later this month. MTM also warned that the first half of 1993 had been affected by continuing financial pressures and difficult trading conditions.</p>

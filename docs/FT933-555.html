			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (13): Why bankers get it wrong / Economics GOING FOR BROKE by Russell Taylor Simon and Schuster, Pounds 17.50 320 pages MAYNARD KEYNES described bankers as 'the most romantic and the least realistic of men.' For all their air of pin-striped authority they seem adept at losing money. It is not just last year's Pounds 240m loss and Pounds 2.5bn bad debt provision at Barclays after its disastrous forays into UK property lending. Recent banking history has been plagued by blunder and scandal, from the Calvi affair in Italy to Latin American lending, from junk bonds in the US to Robert Maxwell. Why do bankers fall into these traps? A book which attempts to answer this question is worthy of serious attention. Going for Broke only partly lives up to its promise. It is a disordered work stuffed full of anecdote and personal reminiscence, delivered at a breathless pace. It is a pity that Mr Taylor had not allowed himself time for more sober reflection. He might then also have avoided the error of referring on page 288 to Mr Henry Wallich, the late federal Reserve Board Governor, as Mr Eli Wallich. Monte dei Paschi di Siena, the Italian bank, is spelled wrongly several times in the text and even in the index. This is inexplicable since it was a founding shareholder in Italian International Bank, which the author ran for many years. One is thus tempted to attribute bankers' failures to their lack of attention to detail. But that would be unfair since the book points to a deeper, structural weakness in the industry. Since the banking crises of the 1920s, banks have been over-protected by their regulators. There is thus little to constrain their ambitions. Competition has become all the more reckless in a world in which wholesale money is freely available in the interbank market, commercial banks have lost touch with their customers and investment bankers no longer have a personal stake in their business. Taylor picks out Citibank, with its overweaning ambition, and Midland of the UK as object lessons about what has gone wrong. Such was the self-delusion of Mr Walter Wriston of Citibank that he believed that countries can never go bust. The Latin American debt crisis proved this notion to be at least an economical version of the truth. By the time it broke, however, Citibank had managed to spread a huge amount of risk around the banking system through the convenient device of the syndicated loan. Midland, by contrast, lost its way as its traditional British industrial customers went into decline. It tried to find a new approach through its purchase with Crocker, but quickly found it was out of its depth. The author also correctly frets about banks' tendency to rely on security to back up their loans, even though it is of uncertain value. He is dubious about cash-flow as an alternative yardstick of creditworthiness, not least because banks cannot be sure that their corporate borrowers will always have paying customers to generate the cash-flow needed to service debt. In the end, the banker's skill boils down to knowing and understanding the customer. Hambros Bank lost no money lending to Ivar Kreuger, the Swedish match king, because it did not like his yellow socks. Relying on judgments like this becomes all the harder when formal credit analysis has become a tool of marketing, designed to help banks sell loans rather than protect them from making bad ones. The best way of preventing that, as Taylor rightly concludes, would be for them once again to run the risk of bankruptcy.</p>

			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Technology: Strides in sugar science The emerging science of glycobiology - the study of carbohydrates - takes an important step forward this week, with the launch of an instrument to determine the sequence of the sugar molecules that are attached to most proteins in the human body. The RAAM GlycoSequencer, developed by Oxford GlycoSystems (OGS) in the UK, enables biomedical researchers to calculate an unknown sugar sequence within a few hours - a job that would previously have taken months of painstaking laboratory work. Its significance may match that of the automatic sequencers of proteins and nucleic acids (genes) which made possible the rapid development of biotechnology in 1980s. Proteins in living cells are linked to complex branched chains of sugar molecules, known as oligosaccharides, which control their biological function. For example the clot-busting protein TPA is in fact a series of glycoproteins which dissolve blood clots at different speeds, depending on their sugar chains. The RAAM sequencer breaks down an oligosaccharide into its constituent units with an array of sugar-splitting enzymes. It then uses software with artificial intelligence to reconstruct the chains. The instrument and equipment cost Pounds 100,000. OGS, founded in 1988, was Oxford University's first spin-off company; its technology originally came from the university's Glycobiology Institute headed by Raymond Dwek. Since then the company has raised Pounds 20m in private financing, though the university still holds a 5 per cent equity stake. The corporate strategy is to increase income as quickly as possible by selling biochemical reagents and instruments for glycobiology research; sales were Pounds 1.6m in 1992 and are doubling annually. At the same time OGS is collaborating with pharmaceutical groups such as SmithKline Beecham to develop drugs for diseases including arthritis and cancer. If conditions permit, OGS will raise more funds through a stock market floatation next year.</p>

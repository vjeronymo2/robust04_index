			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Guatemala City, 30 Jan (ACAN-EFE) -- Guatemalan Vice  President Arturo Herbruger ruled out the possibility that a high  abstention rate at the referendum on constitutional reforms,  which is being held in the country today, will weaken the  government headed by Ramiro de Leon Carpio. In statements to  ACAN-EFE, Herbruger Asturias indicated that a referendum is  based on valid votes and not on the number of people who did not  vote and voluntarily excluded themselves from participating in  the solution of a national problem. Herbruger Asturias, who  prior to holding the vice presidency was the Supreme Electoral  Tribunal (TSE) president, pointed out that the people's  abstention in the referendum "had been anticipated a long time  ago" and "nobody said it would weaken the government."    "We have to take into account that the electoral system  gives  people the option to vote as it is only a civic duty," Herbruger  argued. He credited the electorate's poor response "to the  people's indifference. They do not care what happens  politically in their country" and not to the recent terrorist  actions. "I don't believe the terrorist actions negatively  affected the referendum, although this was their purpose.  People vote with or without terrorism," the vice president  underscored.    Arturo Herbruger cast his yes vote at the Belen Institute,  located approximately 600 meters from the government offices,  and he showed his ballot to reporters. For this reason, the  Union of the National Center requested that his vote be  annulled. According to National Prosecutor Sydney Shaw, the  vice president violated the electoral and political parties laws  because the vote is secret. However, TSE President Fernando  Bonilla indicated that the electoral law does not stipulate any  penalty for citizens who show their ballots.    The Guatemalans were called to a referendum today. They have  to approve or reject the constitutional reforms negotiated  between the deputies and President Ramiro de Leon Carpio in  November 1993. The reforms include the purge of government  organizations and an end to the political confrontations between  government branches.    The first results reported by the media indicate the victory  of the "yes" vote. This victory, however, has been minimized by  the high abstention rate, which, according to local politicians,  could be greater than 60 percent. Important union and civic  organizations, as well as the Guatemalan National Revolutionary  Unity -- with which the government will hold peace talks in  February -- had requested people to abstain from voting.</p>

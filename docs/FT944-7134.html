			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / Vote opens way for Turkish privatisation Turkey's parliament approved a framework privatisation law yesterday, opening the way to sell nearly all the country's loss-making state companies. Approval of the law, by 193 votes to 25, was a welcome political victory for Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, whose fractious coalition government has faced collapse in recent weeks. The law gives the PPA broad authority to sell more than 100 companies without prior parliamentary approval for each sale. Proceeds will finance infrastructure projects and fund severance payments for workers who lose their jobs. The Erdemir steel company and the Petrol Ofisi chain of petrol stations and oil refineries are expected to be among the first companies to be privatised. Officials expect to raise Dollars 4bn from privatisation next year. The state telephone company has a special constitutional status, so cannot be privatised at present. However, the government will be able to license new private telephone services. This is the first structural reform measure parliament has approved since Mrs Ciller in April adopted an emergency package of tax increases and spending cuts after a balance of payments crisis. Both the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, which support her policies, had become exasperated at the slow pace of public sector reform. State companies control or dominate the telecommunications, airline, iron and steel, mining, petroleum and electric power industries. Last year, they contributed one-fifth of the public sector borrowing requirement of Dollars 29.72bn. Politicians have resisted privatisation because state companies are a valuable source of patronage. Earlier this year, Mrs Ciller tried to impose privatisation by decree. But the SHP social democratic party, her junior coalition partner, appealed to the constitutional court. It ruled that the government must win parliamentary approval first. Her conservative DYP party only won the SHP's grudging support by promising to relax Turkey's strict security laws. However, Mrs Ciller now faces mounting opposition from trade unions. On Wednesday, demonstrators paralysed the city of Zonguldak, home to the Demir Celik steel company, to protest against privatisation, which is likely to cost 80 per cent of the com-pany's 8,700 jobs.</p>

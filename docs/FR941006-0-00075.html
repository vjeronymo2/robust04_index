			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Historical records exist for localities throughout the small whorled pogonia's range. The habitat of many of these known historical sites has been destroyed; for example, sites in Vermont, Maryland, New Jersey, and the District of Columbia were lost to habitat destruction, primarily from development. Recent intensive efforts to relocate historical sites in eastern Pennsylvania, New York, Vermont, and Missouri have been unsuccessful (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1992).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the listing of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Isotria medeoloides,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> New Hampshire has seen the destruction of a large, viable population by the construction of summer housing and the potential destruction of a second, recently discovered (1992) population. This second population of over 30 stems will most likely be severely impacted, if not destroyed, within the next few years as the habitat is developed for a subdivision. In Virginia, one of the larger sites will most likely be destroyed within the next few years as its habitat, and adjoining suitable habitat, is developed for housing. Without voluntary landowner protection, many more  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> I. medeoloides <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  populations could be destroyed as development pressures increase.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Development in areas surrounding  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Isotria medeoloides  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> habitat could indirectly be responsible for habitat destruction as roads, power lines and sewer mains are designed to connect settled areas. In addition, housing developments, though not necessarily directly destroying habitat, may cause the alteration of habitat parameters by creating large, permanent openings in the canopy that in turn encourage denser understory growth. Disturbance to populations through increased visitation (however unintentional) from people and pets might also cause direct damage to plants, and eventually a decline in affected populations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This plant primarily appears to reproduce sexually, though little is known at this time regarding seed dispersal and seed banking. The formation of barriers to seed dispersal, either through development of adjacent habitat or from logging or land clearing, may prevent the recolonization of suitable habitat by naturally declining populations. Careful and selective logging may not be harmful to a population; however, heavy timbering and clear-cutting may have long-term impacts on  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Isotria medeoloides  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> populations and their habitat. The creation of logging roads and use of heavy machinery that severely alters soil composition could significantly modify the habitat and cause the direct loss of plants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The 1982 final listing identified the collecting for scientific purposes as contributing to the loss of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Isotria medeoloides <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in the past. Since the listing and the release of both recovery plans, collecting for these purposes is no longer considered to be a threat to the species. However, the potential collecting by wildflower garden enthusiasts for transplanting is still great due to the rarity of this orchid. One landowner in North Carolina was literally harassed by orchid and wildflower enthusiasts when a local garden club publicized the location of his  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> I. medeoloides <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  population (Nora Murdock, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in litt. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1993). Furthermore, vandalism of populations (either out of capriciousness or for private collections) whose locations were publicized continue to be documented (Rawinski 1986b).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Significant commercial trade in the species is not known or expected in the future, nor is any significant import or export of this species expected. Therefore, taking of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> I. medeoloides <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  for these purposes is not considered to be a factor in its decline.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Yevgeniy Kuzin report: "Two-Thirds of ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA </F> Journalists Left Jobless"]    [Text] As of today they have been dismissed in connection  with the editorial office reorganization launched by Editor  Natalya Polezhayeva with the support of the founder -- the  Russian Government.    It all started with the October events, after which  ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA, the organ of the mutinous Supreme Soviet,  was left without an owner. While the collective was thinking  about the sponsorship issue and gathering the necessary  documents together, the government got busy and ROSSIYSKAYA  GAZETA got a new owner. He who pays the piper calls the tune.    The first and quite obvious change (to prevent the old  comrade Ruslan Imranovich from remaining in charge) was the  appearance of a new editor -- Natalya Polezhayeva, whose tough  management style was not welcomed by many staffers.    The new ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA Editorial Office Charter, adopted  in December at a general meeting of the collective, laid down  that the newspaper would be a state enterprise but would  subsequently be floated. But two months later the government  gave the "go-ahead" to a version of the document absolutely  unknown to ordinary staffers, under which the editorial office  won the status of a corporate body. Under the Law on the Mass  Media such a charter can only be adopted by a journalists'  collective by a simple majority. But the journalists learned of  the charter after it had already been ratified.    In an interview with KOMMERSANT, Pavel Gurin, ROSSIYSKAYA  GAZETA general director, blamed the government for this  violation. But that explanation is dubious. Since I am  somewhat familiar with the way in which documents are submitted  to Viktor Stepanovich for signing, it seems to me that nobody in  the government saw this charter. Moreover, the draft new  structure ratified by government apparatus leader Kvasov was  signed by Natalya Ivanovna and Pavel Fedorovich.    Polezhayeva began to carry out the reorganization on the  basis of the ratified charter. As a result, ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA  should have three departments as of today -- a social policy  department, a culture department, and a state and law  department. This is why there have been so many dismissals.  Moreover, legally independent agencies of the most diverse kind  are starting to work under the editorial office -- PROTOCOL for  official information, DERZHAVA for regional information, BIZNES  V ROSSII for economic information, and another for security;  there will be schooling for young journalists, and so forth.  Most probably some of those dismissed will be taken on by the  agencies and find the reorganization painless. But the fact  that the leaders of these new formations were carefully selected  by Polezhayeva shows that only staffers who are particularly  loyal to the Polezhayeva "regime" will be taken on.    Natalya Ivanovna herself refused to comment on the situation  in her own publication. But things may be made clearer by the  Savelovskiy courts, where an illegal dismissal suit has been  filed against the ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA administration by Marina  Cherednichenko, Polezhayeva's former deputy. On the basis of  the results of the first hearing it is as yet hard to be certain  who will win.</p>

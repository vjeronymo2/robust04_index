			<p><P> July 11, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLEDGE OF 'NO NEW TAXES' HURTS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS, REPORT SAYS  </P> <P> The "no new taxes" promise of federal and state politicians is a fine campaign  slogan but it has put many cities in bad shape, the National League of Cities  reported Monday.  </P> <P> Officials said that, in the end, local governments are the ones stuck with  raising taxes and fees to pay their bills.  </P> <P> "The ledgers of local government show the reality of what happens when others  say 'no new taxes,' " Alan Beals, executive director of the league, said. "The  burden is shifted, the taxes are shifted and the cities get clobbered."  </P> <P> He said local governments not only have to carry out their traditional  responsibilities but they have to cope with a growing list "of crisis issues or  unfunded mandates" from state or federal agencies.  </P> <P> The league's report showed that half of the 362 cities surveyed are spending  more than they expect to take in in 1989, and 57% said their income is not  keeping up with inflation.  </P> <P> Sixty-nine percent of the cities increased fees and charges for municipal  services last year, 41% raised property taxes, 36% reported imposing new fees  and charges and 10% instituted new taxes, the report said.  </P> <P> Beals pointed to new drinking water regulations expected to be issued by the  Environmental Protection Agency that would cost $3 billion for plants and  equipment and $500 million a year to operate them, saying the cities will have  to foot the bills.  </P> <P> Douglas D. Peterson, senior policy analyst for the league, said that, of the  362 surveyed communities, only 108 reported that they are ahead financially. He  cited Sunnyvale, Calif., as taking in 10% more than it is spending;  Winston-Salem and Raleigh, N.C., 3%; Virginia Beach, Va., 2.4%, and Kansas  City, Dallas and Minneapolis, 0.5%.  </P> <P> Beals called drug abuse and affordable housing the top problems facing  communities but said they have gone begging for federal money.  </P> <P> "At the same time, we see a massive $285-billion bailout of the scandal-ridden  savings and loan industry sailing through Congress without much anxiety, even  though it represents the largest federal outlay since the cost of fighting  World War II," Beals said.  </P></p>

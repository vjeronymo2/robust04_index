			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / International Company News: Mattel, Fisher-Price to merge MATTEL, the second-biggest US toy maker, yesterday took a step towards challenging Hasbro's dominance of the toy industry by announcing a merger with Fisher-Price, a leading maker of pre-school and infant toys, in a stock-swap which values Fisher-Price at about Dollars 1bn. Under the terms of the definitive agreement, which has been approved by the boards of both companies, each share of Fisher-Price common stock will be exchanged on a tax-free basis for 1.275 shares of Mattel common stock. The merger will be accounted for as a pooling of interests. Mattel has overcome an extremely volatile past in the 1970s and 1980s to become one of the strongest US toy companies, due largely to the performance of its three core toy-lines - Barbie, Hot Wheels and Disney-licensed products. But the company has fallen short of being a rival to Hasbro, the Goliath of the toy industry with a diverse product line, including Playskool, Batman and Nerf products. Mattel had 1992 sales of Dollars 1.85bn, compared with Hasbro's revenues of Dollars 2.54bn. In the same period, Fisher-Price had revenues of Dollars 694m. Fisher-Price, whose lines include Chatter Telephone, Play Desk and a wide range of playsets, was spun off by Quaker Oats and became publicly traded in 1991. Its performance has improved since the spin-off, but it posted a loss in the first quarter this year and has struggled under high costs and operating leverage. The possibility of a merger between Mattel and Fisher-Price has been touted for years. At the time of the spin-off, Mattel confirmed it had approached Quaker and expressed interest in a possible Fisher-Price transaction. Shares of Fisher-Price shot up Dollars 5 1/8 to Dollars 29 in light after-hours trading, Reuter reports from New York. At the end of regular-hours trading, before the merger was announced, Fisher-Price closed at Dollars 23 7/8 . Mattel closed unchanged at Dollars 25 5/8 .</p>

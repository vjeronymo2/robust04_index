However, skepticism claiming that  crime cannot be defeated is not advisable either." [passage  omitted]    He indicated that the Office of the Attorney General of the  Republic [PGR] will maintain a single response for gaining  society's confidence: working with resolve and integrity. By  doing so, it will eventually succeed in addressing the demand  for a reduction in crime.    He remarked that the efforts to combat the drug traffic, and  to punish "money laundering," would be intensified "as an  international commitment for Mexico." In the border zones, the  Federal Judicial Police (PJF) and customs' agents will devote  more effort to detecting smuggled firearms. They will go to  great lengths to combat impunity, and will continue to oversee  the conduct of PJF members and PGR employees. Moreover, those  dismissed for committing crimes will not be reinstated. [passage  omitted]    As for the battle against the drug traffic, he claimed that  the statistics prove the country's effort in this regard, adding  that, in response to Mexico's recommendation that the demand for  drugs be attacked as well, the United States Government has  announced changes in its strategy for eradicating drug  consumption. [passage omitted]    Finally, he announced that the investigations of the  assassination of Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo have made  great progress: 35 persons have been arrested and brought to  trial, and there are 13 arrest warrants to be executed.</p>

			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading STOCK index futures fell, trading at a discount to fair value for most of the session following reports from the US indicating that a cut in interest rates was unlikely in the near term, writes Joel Kibazo. With no support from the other European markets which were closed, the early firmness in the June contract on the FT-SE Index disappeared, sending it down to 2,656 by mid-morning and pulling the underlying cash market lower. The comments from the US caused a heavy bout of selling of the June future, and the weakness in the gilts market was reported to have hurt sentiment further, as did the poor opening on Wall Street. June ended at 2,648, down 25 from the previous session and below its estimated fair value premium of about 6. Volume at 6,190 lots was light. Further falls in June were reported in after-hours' trading. Dealers also talked about the increased business in September, in which more than 1,000 lots had been dealt by the official close. In traded options, turnover in the FT-SE option of 12,875 accounted for the bulk of the day's total volume of 27,900 contracts. Continued selling of Midland Bank once again made it the most active stock option of the day. It had 2,757 lots transacted, with the June 420 calls the busiest series.</p>

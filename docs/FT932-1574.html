			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Arts: Bach in high style - Concert The ninth, month-long Lufthansa Festival of Baroque Music has already been going on since June 1. Always based in the church of St. James, Piccadilly, it has stretched this year more than ever to the Wigmore Hall, where on Monday the St. James's Baroque Players and Consort (conductor Ivor Bolton) delivered a Bach programme in high style. The hall was just about full. That reflected both the confidence that the Festival has inspired among lovers of 18th-century music, and the attraction of two star performers: the harpsichordist Joshua Rifkin, famous for his 'Baroque Beatles', Scott Joplin numbers, tangos and Bach Passions with one voice per choral part - and the young Canadian baritone Gerald Finley, already admired as Britten's Albert Herring and in Mozart at Glyndebourne. Finley was billed here as a 'bass-baritone', but in the bass register the voice still lacks body - surprising in view of his singularly beautiful timbre higher up, where a great factor in the appeal is his warmly affecting bass undertone. No doubt the passing years will lend ballast to his bottom, but meanwhile the voice is lovely to hear. Easily and naturally produced, confidently flexible, laden with dewy, unaffected character; just the qualities, one might add contentiously, that British voice-training seems to throttle in British baritones . . . In the cantata 'Ich habe genug', no. 82 in the BMV index though composed only months later, Finley's uncomplicated honesty was compensation enough for slightly lightweight feeling. This great solo cantata, like the earlier one, has acquired a false Romantic patina through the attentions of ultra-subtle Lieder specialists; the expressive challenges that Schubert and Wolf would set for their interpreters were of quite another order. Here, Anthony Robson's fine, period-oboe solos in both cantatas answered unerringly to Finley's style. Rifkin and Bolton played the two-harpsichord concerto in C (BWV 1061) with energetic polish and in faultless balance. I thought them too metronomically harnessed in the rich central Adagio - but we shall never really know what breadth of rhythmic freedom Bach himself might have expected: the gramophone arrived too late. Contrariwise, in the familiar A minor violin concerto (BMV 1041) Micaela Comberti was sweet-toned and nervily fluent, with no commanding thrust. I wanted franker, gutsier sawing-away, but could not pretend to anything more than 'period' intuition as back-up.</p>

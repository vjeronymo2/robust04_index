President Cesar Gaviria has appointed Manuel Rodriguez as  this agency's first minister. Rodriguez was director of the  government's Institute for the Development of Renewable Natural  Resources (Inderena), an organization that will be liquidated  shortly.    The Congress of the Republic approved the creation of the  Environment Ministry last year. The guidelines, planning, and  implementation of this ministry will be financed by a special  transfer of resources, Rodriguez stated when he accepted the  position.    Colombia is a country rich in natural resources, but those  resources have suffered a serious erosion during the past years  due to the high levels of contamination and deforestation to  allow for the emergence of ``concrete jungles.''    The government has announced, however, that it will launch a  strong environmental protection policy, which the new agency  will coordinated.</p>

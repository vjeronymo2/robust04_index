			<p>BFN     [Text] Kinshasa, 13 Apr (AFP) -- Casimir Bizimungu, former  Rwandan public health minister, and his higher education  colleague arrived in Kinshasa today from Goma (eastern Zaire)  after fleeing the trouble taking place in their country. This  was learned from reliable sources today in the Zairian capital.    According to eyewitnesses who saw them at the Ndjili  airport,  they were welcomed by Etienne Sigigera, the Rwandan ambassador  in Kinshasa. The two former ministers, who were at the Kigali  airport on 6 April waiting for the aircraft bringing back the  Rwandan and Burundian presidents, had to flee towards Zaire when  confusion followed the assassination.</p>

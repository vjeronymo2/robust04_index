			<p><P> October 3, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PERSONALITY: NEW CHIEF AT CLASSICAL STATION  </P> <P> Russ Haberle has been named vice president-general manager of KFSD-FM (94.1),  San Diego's only commercial classical music station. He replaces Nancy  Reynolds, who left to become general manager of Edens Broadcasting's KOY-AM and  Y95-FM in Phoenix.  </P> <P> In his new position, Haberle is responsible for daily operations of the  station, which is owned by Lotus Communications Corp. in Los Angeles and has a  staff of 25.  </P> <P> The 39-year-old La Mesa resident has been with KFSD in various capacities for  12 years. He joined the staff in 1977 as an account executive.  </P> <P> "I've always been intrigued by radio," Haberle said. "I grew up in Chicago,  which is a great radio market. . . . went to Southern Illinois University,  which has a very good broadcast department, specially geared toward sales and  marketing," he said.  </P> <P> In 1982, after two years as the station's sales manager, Haberle transferred to  Tucson, where he was vice president-general manager of KTKT-AM and KLPX-FM,  also owned by Lotus Communications. He returned to KFSD as station manager in  1984.  </P> <P> Haberle calls his promotion as general manager his dream job. "My first job out  of college was with KFSD, and ever since it has always been my dream to run  this station."  </P> <P> "I'm thrilled that the company has given me the opportunity to run one of the  finest classical stations in the country," he said.  </P> <P> When he's not at the station, Haberle plays basketball and swims. He is a past  vice president of the San Diego AdClub and continues to be active in the  advertising community.  </P> <P> KFSD went on the air with its classical music format in the late 1920s and has  remained San Diego's only full-time, commercial classical music station.

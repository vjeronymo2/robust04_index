			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Birse runs up Pounds 2.7m loss BIRSE GROUP yesterday announced details of a refinancing of its bank loans which it said should put to rest rumours that it was about to join other construction companies which had failed. Mr Peter Birse, chairman, said that all of the company's short-term borrowings had been rescheduled on 'a committed three-year basis to May 1996' reflecting the banks' confidence in the group's long-term future. At the same time Birse announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 2.7m for the six months to the end of October compared with profits of Pounds 1.8m. The company, in which Bilfinger Berger, the German contractor, has a 15 per cent stake, has decided not to pay an interim dividend (1.65p). This is after making a loss per share of 3.6p (1.8p earnings). Turnover fell from Pounds 189m to Pounds 164m. Operating loses amounted to Pounds 429,000 (Pounds 3.25m profits) and the pre-tax result was after a jump in interest charges from Pounds 1.45m to Pounds 2.28m. Mr Birse, commenting on the results and the refinancing, said: 'There have been a lot of rumours lately, mostly spread by competitors, that we were about to go down the same route as Budge and Lilley, which recently went into receivership. We have been very successful in winning work and increasing our market share, because we offer customers a very competitive price. This has prompted envy from competitors which have been trying to undermine our business.' Mr Birse said that the banks had agreed to reschedule all of the group's debts with any extra cost in borrowing 'which they would not have done if they had any doubts about our future.' The switch from short-term to medium-term borrowings also means that the company will find it easier to satisfy financial criteria demanded by some utilities before they will allow companies to tender for work. Nonetheless, Birse remains highly geared. Net debt of approaching Pounds 40m at the end of October compared with shareholders funds of Pounds 25m. Debt is expected to fall to Pounds 30m by the end of the financial year at April 30, leaving gearing still in excess of 100 per cent. The company said that trading conditions continued to be very harsh. It remained determined, however, to maintain its high level of business and keep its construction team together, even if it meant continuing to bid very competitive prices and upsetting competitors. The shares closed 2 1/2 p down at 30 1/2 p. COMMENT The good news for shareholders is that Birse's bankers have taken the view that the company is worth supporting and will survive. Having said that, the trading outlook, in the company's own words, remains harsh. Contracting at best will break even for the year while commercial property is likely to remain a tough market for at least another 18 months. The company, however, is no longer under any immediate pressure to sell property at distressed prices to reduce borrowings. Losses for the year could total Pounds 5m to Pounds 6m say analysts. The shares are unlikely to attract new buyers.</p>

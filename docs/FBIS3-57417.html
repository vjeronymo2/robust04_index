He said any  government reshuffle was a routine process which should not been  seen as a change in the reform policy.    Soskovets said the functions of his commission for routine  economic management were widened. It will now monitor the  rational use of raw materials, transport safety and prices and  tariffs for electricity, fuel, oil products and railway freight.    The commission is also responsible for issuing export quotas  for vital raw materials and products.</p>

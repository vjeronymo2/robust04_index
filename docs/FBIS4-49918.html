			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Central People's Broadcasting Station reporter Liu </F> Zhenying (0491 2182 5391) and XINHUA reporter Zhang Sutang (1728  1372 1016)]    [Text] Beijing, 10 May (XINHUA) -- The fourth seminar for  principal provincial and ministerial leading cadres to study  Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping  opened at the Central Party School today. Hu Jintao, Standing  Committee member of the Political Bureau and member of the  Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee and principal of the  Central Party School, spoke at the opening ceremony today. He  emphasized: In studying Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics, we should  combine theoretical study with practice, and concentrate efforts  on two issues -- to master the theoretical system and to use the  theory to solve existing major practical problems. Only when we  have grasped the scientific world outlook and methodology can we  assess the situation in a correct way, achieve unity in  thinking, have the overall situation under control, tackle major  problems, enhance our foresightedness in our work and do it in a  more scientific manner, brush aside difficulties, and  continually promote the reform and open policy and the socialist  modernization cause.    Ding Guangen, member of the CPC Central Committee Political  Bureau and Secretariat, presided over the opening ceremony. Ren  Jianxin, Secretariat member of the CPC Central Committee,  attended the ceremony.    In his speech, Hu Jintao said: All localities and  departments have done a tremendous job in implementing the  central authorities' general principles and plans for the work  of the whole party. While the general situation is good, there  are still certain problems and difficulties in China's social  and economic lives. Therefore, we should, first, be clearly  aware of the problems and difficulties on the road of advance,  noting both their objective existence, as well as the advantages  for solving problems and difficulties. We should neither treat  them lightly nor forfeit our confidence in solving them.  Second, we should seek a scientific way for solving problems.  We should step up investigation and study and accurately  identify the crux of problems. We should actively and  conscientiously probe for solutions through reform and  development.    He said: We should take bold steps in probing for solutions  to the existing problems under the guidance of scientific  theories. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism  with Chinese characteristics, which is profound in meaning and  wide in coverage, has given an incisive exposition on a series  of fundamental issues related to the building of socialism with  Chinese characteristics, including the adherence to one central  task and two basic points; correct handling of the relationship  between reform, development, and stability; the persistence in  being tough with both hands; and the CPC's internal improvement  as the key to solving problems in China. Problems which Comrade  Xiaoping has repeatedly emphasized that we must solve properly,  things which he has reminded us time and again that we must pay  attention to, and tendencies which he has periodically  admonished that we must guard against are still of great guiding  and practical significance today. In a sense, theoretical level  decides leadership quality. This is particularly so for the  party's senior leading cadres. If we want to implement the  party's basic line comprehensively and accurately, to grasp the  overall situation of the work of the whole party and country, to  do all tasks well, and to consolidate and develop the good  situation, we must study theories with a greater sense of  urgency and more conscientiously so that we can enhance our  theoretical level and more effectively carry out our leadership  responsibility.    He said: The present basic task for the whole party in  further studying Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism  with Chinese characteristics is to grasp the theory's scientific  system and use it to solve existing prominent problems through  profound study. The theory is a comprehensive system. Without  studying and mastering the ideological views and principles of  the theoretical system, it is impossible to truly understand and  correctly use the theory in practice. To really master the  theory's scientific system is no easy task and cannot be  accomplished overnight; it requires protracted and unremitting  efforts. The sole purpose of study is to use the theory as a  weapon for guiding and correctly identifying and solving  practical problems in reform and construction. This year, we  have launched a great number of comprehensive coordinated reform  programs focused on the establishment of a socialist market  economic structure. The reform programs, which involve  readjustment of the pattern and relations of interests in  various sectors, will tackle many deep-seated problems and will  be rather difficult. In the process of deepening reform in all  fields and expediting the establishment of a socialist market  economic structure, it will be a real test for our party  committees and leading cadres at all levels to maintain a  sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development; to ensure  social and political stability; to comprehensively implement the  party Central Committee's policies, decisions, and plans; and to  properly handle the relations between reform, development, and  stability. At present, we should take effective measures to  solve problems unfavorable to further reform, development, and  stability.    Discussing the question of strengthening and improving party  building, he said: The key to adhering to the party's basic  line for 100 years lies in the party. The key to creating the  overall environment for seizing the opportunity, deepening  reform, opening up wider, promoting development, and maintaining  stability also lies in the party. If we do not strengthen party  leadership and further promote party building, we can go  nowhere. We will accomplish nothing if we fail to implement the  party's basic line in the light of realities and if we deviate  from the overall interests of reform, development, and stability  in promoting party building alone. We must keep abreast of the  demands and tasks of the new situation and must improve the  party ideologically, politically, organizationally, and in its  style so as to solve the existing problems in party building and  increase the party's cohesive and rallying power and fighting  capacity to provide more effective guarantees for reform,  development, and stability.    Responsible comrades from the departments concerned Zeng  Qinghong, Zheng Bijian, Zhao Zongnai, Wang Jialiu Zheng Keyang,  Chen Fujin, and Zhou Ziyu were present at the opening ceremony.</p>

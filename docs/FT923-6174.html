			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / British science 'in decline': British Association for the Advancement of Science BRITISH science is declining in relation to the rest of the world, it was agreed at the meeting, Clive Cookson writes. Mr Robert Jackson, junior minister responsible for science, said there was 'a certain inevitability' about the fall as other countries developed. He denied there was a brain drain. 'Statistics supplied by the universities show that at every level there is a net inflow (of scientists) into the UK,' Mr Jackson said. Dr David Pegg, head of the Medical Research Council's cryobiology unit - which studies the biology of organisms below their normal temperature  - said that after the MRC's halt in its funding a leading member is to emigrate. Dr Michael Taylor will set up an Institute of Cryomedicine - the study of medicine in freezing temperatures - in Pittsburgh, in the US. However, Mr David Pendlebury, of the US Institute for Scientific Information, said the frequency with which UK research was cited worldwide showed the long-term decline in the impact of British science might 'be starting to level off'.</p>

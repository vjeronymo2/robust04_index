			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OAK PARK;  </P> <P> SCHOOLS WEIGH Y'S CHILD-CARE PROPOSAL  </P> <P> The Oak Park Unified School District is studying a proposal from the Triunfo  YMCA to provide preschool and after-school child care for students in the  Agoura area.  </P> <P> Officials from the YMCA, which covers Westlake Village, Agoura and Oak Park,  presented the child-care proposal to the school district's Board of Trustees  Tuesday night.  </P> <P> YMCA Executive Director Pete Regli said his organization would put a portable  building behind the school district office on Conifer Street and would offer  various programs at a cost comparable to other preschool and child-care  programs. Regli said the program would offer sliding-scale payments to  low-income parents.  </P> <P> The YMCA has not figured out how to come up with the initial financing for the  preschool, Regli said.  </P> <P> "There is an up-front cost of about $40,000 that we can't afford right now," he  said. "But the ongoing costs would be paid by the people who use the center."  </P> <P> The preliminary plan is to open a preschool, then expand to after-school child  care, Regli said.  </P> <P> "We do get a lot of calls from people asking for preschool and child-care  programs," he said. "We have a problem referring them because there just aren't  that many preschools."  </P> <P> The proposal was generally well-received by the trustees, who asked Regli to  return when he has firmer cost estimates and a more detailed plan for programs  that would be offer.  </P> <P> The school district has 1,580 students at two elementary schools, a middle  school and a high school.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Massimo Teodori: "American Complex"] </F>   [Text] The United States' and Italy's expectations for  President Clinton's visit to Rome are all too clear. Clinton  needs to regain the European people's confidence, shaken by the  scandal-mongering attacks on him and disconcerted by his  wandering strategy in foreign policy. Berlusconi needs  ratification, from the most powerful chief of state and Italy's  traditional reference point, of the legitimacy and solidity of  his leadership in this new stage of the republic. Both leaders  are seeking to enhance their image -- the American leader with a  touching re-evocation of D-Day on the European fronts, which 50  years ago marked the definitive supremacy of his country's role  in the world; and the Italian leader, with a display of  credibility on the international scene, which has hitherto  caused him some dismay.    The Italian leadership class' attitude to the United States  has always suffered from a "complex." The U.S. Administration  has often been asked to judge and to interfere in Italian  domestic politics by providing support to this or that political  solution, or acknowledgment of particular balances, or perhaps  by issuing an excommunication to the adversaries of the moment.  For years the DC [Christian Democratic Party] and the PCI  [Italian Communist Party] used the American pretext for their  own domestic purposes: the ruling party, in order to lead people  to believe that it could not be replaced in the country's  leadership because of the impending Communist threat and the  PCI, by espousing this theory in order to strengthen  associationism as the only possible solution within the overall  bloc. In the same way, now we are witnessing the powerful  resurgence of the "American complex," despite the fact that the  international situation has changed radically since the collapse  of the Wall and therefore that America's interest in internal  balances in countries where there are communists has declined to  virtually nothing.    This has been apparent in recent weeks. First, Foreign  Minister Antonio Martino went to extraordinary lengths in  Washington to explain sophisticated differences between the AN  [National Alliance], the MSI [Italian Social Movement],  fascists, and postfascists to his opposite numbers, who were  mainly interested in what attitude the new government intends to  adopt to the Atlantic Alliance and who were basically  uninterested in the internal balances of his victorious  electoral coalition. Then came the interview on television  channels 1 and 5 news, in which Clinton was clumsily asked  whether he believed that Italy was moving in a "neofascist"  direction -- a question typical of someone suffering from a  complex and one that deserved a curt, impartial, and pragmatic  reply: "People must be judged on what they do, not by labels."  Last, there was Berlusconi's interview with THE WASHINGTON POST,  with the succession of statements, denials, and attributions of  responsibility for the verdict on fascism, which piled one  embarrassment on top of another.    So the time has come for the Italian Government to realize  once and for all that the anxious requests for internal  political legitimization usually made to America, and especially  to the Clinton Administration, are neither appropriate nor  welcome. The President said so clearly across the Atlantic, and  it has been repeated by [National] Security Adviser Anthony Lake  and by the authoritative chairman of the Senate Foreign Affairs  Committee, Lee Hamilton. It has been reaffirmed, with different  points of emphasis, by a number of American figures -- Henry  Kissinger, David Rockefeller, Lee Iacocca, and Mario Cuomo. The  same thing was stated baldly in August 1993 -- "the Washington  administration is very little interested in what happens in  Italy" - by the intellectual, Edward Luttwak, whose independent  opinion on Italy was mistaken for a destabilizing message from  the Washington government.    Now Clinton will appear on our beautiful Capitoline Hill in  Rome and expect to see welcoming crowds. We pay tribute through  him to the history of a nation that first liberated us from  Nazi-fascism and that then helped to halt Stalinism.  Politicians of all persuasions must not try to burden the  American President with tasks and responsibilities that he must  not, and does not want to, bear. The representatives of the  government majority must free themselves of the complex of  needing America's approval. And let the representatives of the  minority, who describe themselves as neo-Clintonites, spare us  their recent zeal as converts, having long been preachers in the  churches of anti-Americanism.    The close ties between Italy and the United States, under  the  banner of freedom, are too important to have to be used and  abused for petty political purposes.</p>

			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / 1,400 jobs to go at naval bases AFTER WEEKS of delay, the government yesterday confirmed that 1,400 jobs will be lost at Portland and Portsmouth naval bases. A provisional announcement was made in November that more than 1,000 jobs would go, but a final decision was delayed because of concern at the political fall-out from rising job losses. Mr Archie Hamilton, armed forces minister, said in a Commons written answer that the Portland base in Dorset will close by April 1996, and its sea training operations will be transferred to Devonport, Plymouth. This will save an estimated Pounds 70m over 10 years. More than 1,000 service and civilian jobs will be lost at Portland, but Mr Hamilton said consultations were continuing with the unions about the implications. The Ministry of Defence will also be working with local authorities to investigate alternative commercial uses for the naval base. The minister also confirmed that the fleet maintenance and repair organisation at Portsmouth will be reduced, involving the shedding of 400 civilian jobs and leaving a workforce of about 1,800. Ship refitting will cease at Portsmouth by this summer, although Portsmouth-based vessels will return there for maintenance work. Refitting work will be transferred to the royal dockyards at Devonport, and Rosyth in Fife. The announcement, part of the continuing effect of the so-called peace dividend and the government's Options for Change defence programme, was delayed because of the news of 5,000 job losses at Rolls-Royce. Defence industries and tourism have traditionally been the biggest employers at Portland, and local unemployment is expected now to rise to about 16 per cent.</p>

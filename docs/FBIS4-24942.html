			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporters Lo Ping (5012 0393) and Li Tzu-ching </F> (7812 5261 0079): "`The Enemy's Presence' Is Discovered in 17  Provinces and 33 Cities"]    [Text] Recently, CPC leaders repeatedly emphasized  stability and more efforts were made to keep watch on  dissidents' activities. The reason may be found from the  following report.    At 1800 on 20 May, the State Council General Office and the  State Council Leading Group in Charge of Public Order called a  telephone conference of leading party and government cadres in  charge of public security, state security, and the armed police  in various provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities to  report on social and political developments and public order  throughout the country since the beginning of May.  <H5>  Organized "Subversive Activities" Have Arisen in 17 </H5> Provinces and 33 Cities    As revealed at the conference, organized hostile underground  activities of incitation which established ties to subvert the  social system and the people's government arose in 33 cities and  seven prefectures and districts in 17 provinces, autonomous  regions, and municipalities throughout the country and, in  particular, the situations were more serious in 12 cities and  three districts in seven provinces, autonomous regions, and  municipalities, comprising Sichuan Province, Shaanxi Province,  Shanxi Province, Hubei Province, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous  Region, Liaoning Province, Beijing, Chengdu, Chongqing, Xian,  Taiyuan, Urumqi, Wuhan, Yining, Yanan, Shenyang, Anshan, Dalian,  Yichang, and three districts of the Beijing Municipality.    Also disclosed at the conference were many instances of  snipers firing shots at soldiers and policemen on the outskirts  of Wuhan, Xian, Chengdu, and Beijing. On the three days of 3,  8, and 12 May, nine such incidents occurred, causing 11  casualties and five explosions.  <H5>  Party Members and Three Types of Persons in the Cultural </H5> Revolution in "Extremist Organizations"    It was also reported that a handful of foreign-invested  organizations in the mainland had taken part in or were used for  hostile and illegal activities, including transmitting by  facsimile instigating and offensive propaganda material to party  and government departments and making anonymous phone calls to  carry out activities of interference and sabotage. In a few  areas, flaunting the banner of defending Marxism-Leninism-Mao  Zedong Thought and taking advantage of problems existing and  arising in the current process of construction and reform,  underground organizations instigated cadres and the masses to  slow down their work and go on strike and organized activities  to overturn existing policies. They made open appeals to party  members to step forward bravely to "rescue our party" and of  "down with the old-line capitalist-advocate Deng Xiaoping."  Party members and three types of persons in the Cultural  Revolution were in these "extremist organizations.    The conference urged party committees and departments  concerned at all levels to stand fast at their posts, remain  vigilant, face up to grimmer struggles which may arise, and  smash and crack down on, without showing any mercy, organized  sabotage and activities carried out by hostile forces.  <H5>  Petitions and Protests by Workers and Staff in 19 Cities </H5>   On the eve of the fifth anniversary of the democratic  movement in 1989, the whole country is on the highest alert and  the CPC keeps on arresting dissidents. But in the latter half  of last April, workers and staff from mines, enterprises, and  units in 19 cities "illegally" assembled and lodged petitions  and protests, and marches in which over 1,000 people took part  broke out in eight cities.    The 19 cities were: Shijiazhuang, Harbin, Qiqihar, Anshan,  Xining, Baoji, Chongqing, Chengdu, Hefei, Taiyuan, Shenyang,  Lanzhou, Xian, Urumqi, Changsha, Harmi, Zhangjiang, Guiyang, and  Nanchang.    The eight cities in which marches broke out were: Harbin,  Anshan, Baoji, Urumqi, Nanchang, Xining, Chongqing, and Lanzhou.  <H5>  Over 5,000 Workers of Anshan Iron and Steel Works March in </H5> the Street    In the latter half of last April, over 5,000 workers and  staff in the iron and steel capital Anshan (most were workers  and staff of Anshan Iron and Steel Works) took 120 cars to march  around the urban district and shouted such slogans as "workers  as the masters of the state," "protecting workers' class  interests," "down with the newborn bourgeoisie," "yes to  socialism, no to capitalism," and "long live the working class."  The march went on for more than three hours.  <H5>  Baoji City Government Is Forced To Accept Workers and </H5> Staff's Demands    In Baoji City, Shaanxi Province, over 2,000 railway,  engineering, and metallurgical workers and staff assembled and  held a demonstration in front of the city federation of trade  unions building to oppose cutting down staff and abolishing  medical benefits and ask for the granting of education  allowances to children of workers and staff. Finally, the city  government was forced to agree that staff would not be reduced  this year and that all benefits would be kept unchanged. The  marchers shouted "long live workers' unity" and sang the song  "Unity Is Strength," and they even bought drinks from shops to  celebrate.    Over 2,000 People Marched in Urumqi    Over 1,000 and over 2,000 people assembled and marched in  Urumqi, capital of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, on 26 and  28 April respectively. Marchers assembled at the People's Park,  Nanmen Stadium, and the railway station and then went to the  People's Square. The autonomous regional party committee and  the regional government organized nearly 2,000 cadres to  "dissuade" the marchers from going while stressing that  "everything can be discussed and solved." However, more than  800 people still gathered at the People's Square to urge the  government to protect the working class's interests, curb  inflation, and crack down on corrupt bureaucrats. Some of the  marchers even shouted the separatist slogan of "long live  Xinjiangstan."  <H5>  A Marching Group of Workers Is Intercepted by Public </H5> Security Personnel and Armed Policemen in Lanzhou City    In Lanzhou City, capital of Gansu Province, over 2,000  workers and staff from petroleum and chemical plants and woolen  mills assembled at the Baitashan Park, and then proceeded to the  provincial government building by car or on foot. Public  security personnel, armed policemen, unit cadres, and militiamen  were dispatched by the authorities to intercept the marchers on  the way.  <H5>  Enterprise Cadres in Xining Support Workers' Demonstrations </H5>   In Xining City, capital of Qinghai Province, more than 1,000  woolen workers and staff went on strike and marched on the  street. They marched down Dongguan Avenue, Xiguan Avenue, and  Xinning Road and then assembled in the People's Park. The  wool-spinning industry is always the key industry of Xining City  and there are nearly 20 woolen mills with a large scale of  production. The cost of raw materials has kept on increasing  year after year. It increased by 230 percent from 1985 to 1992  and by another 40 percent in 1993, but the selling price only  increased by 180 percent. In 1994, the higher authorities  decided to raise the price of woolen material by 62 percent.  Therefore, 12 major workers' demonstrations have broken out  since the beginning of this year, and some were supported by  party and government cadres in the enterprises.  <H5>  The Authorities Dared Not Rashly Put Down Workers' </H5> Demonstrations    Faced with the turbulent wave of workers' demonstrations  which had spread to 19 cities in the Northeast, the North, the  Northwest, the Central South, and the East, the CPC formulated  and issued the "Decision on Using Weapons While on Patrol and  Performing Duties" and even promulgated a nationwide alert  order, yet they dared not rashly use force and there was no  bloodshed. It seems that the CPC authorities understood that it  was unwise to resort to high-handed means, so they could only  beg the "official trade unions" for help.  <H5>  The CPC Strengthens the Work of the "Official Trade Unions" </H5>   On 6 May, Wei Jianxing, member of the CPC Central  Committee's  Political Bureau and the CPC Central Committee's Secretariat and  president of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, issued a  warning at the national work meeting attended by chairmen of  trade union federations in various provinces, autonomous  regions, and municipalities throughout the country: We must  strengthen our party's leadership over trade unions; give play  to the vanguard role of trade union federations at all levels  through organization, propaganda, and concrete work; and train  trade union cadres from among party members and workers and  staff who have a firm political stand, a mass foundation, and  considerable prestige and working ability. This is the central  task of the present organizational work. We must train new  blood for our party and build up a key force, a contingent of  veteran and advanced producers, and a contingent of grass-roots  cadres and militiamen. Wei Jianxing said: We must adopt  organizational measures to reverse the slackened situation  existing in trade unions at all levels. Some trade unions have  become rear-service and welfare departments; some have become  the mouthpiece for making unreasonable demands on our party and  our government; and a handful of them are under the control of  evildoers and have played a part in instigating workers and  staff to make trouble, go on strike, lodge petitions, or even  establish illegal organizations and make illegal appointments to  make rival claims as equals of our party and our government.  <H5>  Chairmanship of First-Grade Trade Unions Must Be Assumed by </H5> Members of Party Committee Standing Committees at the Same Levels    On the night of 6 May, Jiang Zemin said while meeting with  leading trade union cadres from all provinces: As far as  socialist construction and deepening of reform is concerned, the  working class is always the principal force. To score a victory  in the cause of socialist construction and revolution, we must  rely on the working class and give play to the leading role of  the working class.    On 9 May, the CPC Central Committee Secretariat issued a  circular on "Strengthening the Leadership of Trade Unions at All  Levels" to party committees at the provincial level. The  circular stipulated that the chairmanship of first-grade trade  unions at the provincial, prefectural, and city levels must be  assumed by members of party committee standing committees or  deputy secretaries of party committees at the same levels; that  the chairmanship of trade unions of various large mines,  enterprises, and units must be concurrently assumed by members  of party committee standing committees or deputy secretaries of  party committees; that vice chairmen of trade unions can attend  meetings of party committee standing committees; and that party  committee standing committees must place the trade union work at  the top of the agenda.    The matter is very clear. The CPC wants to work through its  "official trade unions" to control the contingent of workers and  staff and suppress the workers' movement and the democratic  movement. But the question is: As the CPC--the "vanguard of  the working class"--has lost its credibility, what capabilities  do its official organs still have?</p>

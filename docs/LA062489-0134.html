			<p><P> June 24, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PAINFUL DISEASE ELUDES TESTING;  </P> <P> FIBROMYALGIA FREQUENTLY MISDIAGNOSED, BUT AS MANY AS 3 MILLION IN U.S. HAVE IT  </P> <P> Imagine that the skin on your hands has been slowly peeled off. Then imagine  the raw tissue is exposed to the sun for hours.  </P> <P> This is how Patty Dicker, 41, of Newport Beach describes the pain caused by  fibromyalgia, an often-misdiagnosed and little-researched disease from which  she has suffered for 11 years.  </P> <P> Also called fibrositis, the affliction is most common to women (one male for  every 10 female victims) and is one of the most prevalent, debilitating and  painful forms of arthritis, afflicting an estimated 3 million people in the  United States alone.  </P> <P> It is a rheumatic disorder with varied symptoms, ranging from sharp or burning  pain to deep aching in the joints, muscle spasms, headaches, and even feeling  bruised from head to toe -- so bruised that even the touch of light clothing is  agonizing.  </P> <P> And while it is not life-threatening, many victims say they have longed for  death during a flare-up -- a time when on a scale from 1 to 10, the pain is at  a 10.  </P> <P> "Oddly enough, the pain can move and change within five minutes. It can go from  your hands to your knee or neck, or all over the body," said Dicker, a tall,  willowy blonde who looks the picture of health. "You can feel no pain and go to  open a door and pull back because the doorknob has hurt you. It's like living  in a mine field. You never know what's going to hurt you. I look at myself and  I look healthy. My hand looks normal and yet it's burning with pain."  </P> <P> Loss of energy is another symptom of the disease. Many sufferers don't have the  strength even to brush their own hair, let alone maintain a job or take care of  children and household duties.  </P> <P> "I've always been very active," says 58-year-old Amy Howard of Brea, who  started having symptoms of fibromyalgia in 1984 after suffering a back injury  at work. She has been to countless doctors and through hundreds of tests in the  past four years. But the disease is undetectable by most medical tests and is  often dismissed as "all in the head."  </P> <P> "At times, I thought I was going crazy," Howard said. "It was hard to explain  the pain because it changed daily, sometimes hourly. I was exhausted all the  time and as a result very depressed. I felt the doctors just thought I was a  hypochondriac."  </P> <P> More than once, Howard was told she should see a psychologist. Even her husband  and children were skeptical at first.  </P> <P> "I felt so guilty about not being able to work or do housework. I could just  lie around all day and when I heard my husband's car in the driveway I would  struggle up and pretend that I was doing something."  </P> <P> She recently visited a rheumatologist who diagnosed her as having fibromyalgia.  </P> <P> "It was almost a relief. Now at least I know I'm not going crazy," she said.  "But I must learn to live with the disease.  </P> <P> "It's very frustrating. I've always loved people, always loved to work. Now I  don't even have the strength to play with my own grandchildren."  </P> <P> Being told it "was all in the head" is a common story among the afflicted  because many doctors are unfamiliar with fibromyalgia (of about 500,000  physicians in the United States, only 3,000 are rheumatologists).  </P> <P> "Part of the Arthritis Foundation's goal is to educate health professionals  about it," said Pat Atwell, spokesperson for the local chapter of the  foundation, located in Santa Ana. "Fibromyalgia is new, within the past 15  years, as far as any research being done and even in naming the disease."  </P> <P> Dr. Don L. Goldenberg of the Arthritis Center at Boston University said:"There  were no scientific papers related to the syndrome presented at the annual  meeting of the American Rheumatism Assn. in 1981, but there were nine presented  in 1987.  </P> <P> "One of the 'state-of-the-art' lectures at the 1987 meeting was a review of  fibromyalgia. At our annual meetings, the attendance at the  nonarticular-rheumatism study group, largely devoted to fibromyalgia, has  tripled in the past five years."  </P> <P> There is no set definition of the disease. The symptoms are varied and vague.  However, most North American rheumatologists seem to agree that patients with  fibromyalgia have the following common features: widespread musculoskeletal  pain (usually accompanied by stiffness that is worse in the morning); chronic  fatigue and poor endurance; the presence of multiple tender points; a variation  in symptoms depending on the weather, overexertion and stress, and a decrease  of symptoms with heat therapy.  </P> <P> Two years ago, 58-year-old Norma Borie of Long Beach awoke feeling as though  she had torn every muscle in her chest. The following day, the excruciating  pain had spread to the rest of her body, so unbearable that she had to be  hospitalized.  </P> <P> After finally being diagnosed, she said, "I remember lying in my hospital bed  and hearing the nurses whispering about me in the hall as they looked at my  chart. Only one of them had even heard of the disease. They were afraid to care  for me because they didn't know what the disease was."  </P> <P> Borie says she made up her mind then that she would do everything in her power  to help promote research and education for the disease and donated $300,000 to  the Arthritis Foundation for just that purpose.  </P> <P> Because of her donation and others, word is spreading via telethons, literature  distributed by the Arthritis Foundation and symposiums.  </P> <P> Recently, support groups have been formed for sufferers of the disease. FAN  (Fibromyalgia Awareness Network) in Orange County had its first meeting a year  ago. Sixty women showed up.  </P> <P> "It was a very emotional meeting," recalled Betty Moriarity, a 62-year-old Long  Beach teacher who was forced to take early retirement because she kept falling  asleep in class.  </P> <P> "There was a lot of crying. It was such a relief to know that you're not alone.  Just to be able to communicate with others who could relate to the pain and  psychological stresses you've been through brought a certain amount of  serenity. I was amazed that there was such a large number of us."  </P> <P> FAN meets every fourth Tuesday from 2 to 3:30 p.m. in the Plaza Classroom at  the Medical Center of Garden Grove.  </P> <P> The group offers discussion sessions as well as speakers such as Dr. Bob  Merlino from the Chapman Pain Clinic, who recently spoke on the control of  pain.  </P> <P> A cure has not been found for fibromyalgia. Once diagnosed, patients are put on  a combination of therapies to help control the symptoms. These include diet,  antidepressants, exercise, cortisone shots at the trigger points, biofeedback,  heat massage and pain-coping techniques.  </P> <P> Therapies and their effectiveness differ from patient to patient. Patty Dicker  considers herself lucky. Her first therapy of medication left her pain-free for  almost three years. Her next flare-up was not eased by the same medication, and  a whole new combination of drugs was prescribed. She had two more years free of  pain, although her trigger points never disappeared. She recently had another  flare-up and began exploring a new medication therapy.  </P> <P> Norma Borie has never been free of pain. "I'm always in about a Level-7 pain.  When I have a flare-up, I feel as though I'm going to die.  </P> <P> "I've always been a very physical, touch-oriented person. My husband used to  lay next to me at night and hold my hand at first -- but now the pain is too  much even for that. The thought of someone touching me makes me cringe. I miss  my hugs."  </P></p>

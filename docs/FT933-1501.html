			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / International Company News: AT&amp;T will not oppose BT's US stake-building AMERICAN Telephone &amp; Telegraph said yesterday that it would not oppose British Telecom's plan to take a 20 per cent stake in MCI Communications, AT&amp;T's main rival in the US long distance telephone market. However, it simultaneously urged the Federal Communications Commission, which governs the industry, to bring in new rules to ensure that before a foreign carrier was allowed to operate in the US market, US carriers must have comparable access to the foreign carrier's market within a reasonable period - two years as a rule of thumb. The move came in response to an MCI filing with the FCC seeking confirmation that the BT deal conforms to commission regulations. BT agreed in June to take a one-fifth stake in MCI for Dollars 4.3bn. Britain's Department of Trade and Industry is considering an application from AT&amp;T for a licence to gain direct access to the UK public telecommunications network. Mr Alex Mandl, chief executive of AT&amp;T's communications services group, said that 'in the absence of any comprehensive rules, the FCC is allowing foreign-based carriers to enter the wide-open US market while American carriers are often kept out of the home market of these foreign companies'. In a separate filing with the FCC, AT&amp;T also urged the commission to end the company's designation as the 'dominant' carrier in the US and treat it like other long-distance companies. AT&amp;T accounts for around 60 per cent of the US market.</p>

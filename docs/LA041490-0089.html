			<p><P> April 14, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MERCHANTS OF MENACE IN WAR ON DRUGS;  </P> <P> PARAPHERNALIA: HOUSEHOLD ITEMS THAT CAN BE USED IN SMOKING CRACK ARE STOCKED AT  MANY STORES IN PARTS OF THE CITY.  </P> <P> In some parts of Los Angeles, getting the paraphernalia needed to smoke crack  cocaine is as easy as stopping at the corner store. The items are on the  shelves at almost every liquor store and neighborhood market. Because most are  common household products in everyday use, store managers seem unconcerned  about running afoul of the law. But for drug users, these products take on an  entirely different meaning.  </P> <P> Glass tubes are easily fashioned into crack pipes. Copper mesh scrubbers used  to scour pots are taken apart and made into tiny pipe screens. Cotton balls  doused with 151-proof rum are a preferred method for "firing up." And there are  tiny zip-lock bags for storing and selling the highly addictive form of  cocaine.  </P> <P> The same is true of the clothing gang members use to identify themselves. In  some stores and at swap meets it is easy to find bandannas and athletic  shoelaces in colors or brands favored by certain gangs, clothing with gang  names sewed or stamped on and even magazines and catalogues targeted to gang  members.  </P> <P> As crack use and gang activity mushroom in Los Angeles and across the country,  so has the demand for these products, although few store owners seem to be  getting rich on the sales. In neighborhoods hit hard by gangs and the crack  epidemic, merchants are being criticized for profiting at the expense of their  communities.  </P> <P> "It's like one big conspiracy of greed and everybody's a part of it," said Leon  Watkins, who operates the South-Central Los Angeles-based Family Hot Line, a  telephone service for families in crisis. "The worst part about it is it's all  out in the open where kids can see it. Everybody knows the stores."  </P> <P> Some merchants contend that they merely stock the products they know sell  quickly. They insist they have no idea how the items are used once they leave  the store. Police often are skeptical of these claims, yet seldom are able to  act because the items have legitimate uses.  </P> <P> But the way in which these products are displayed at certain stores and the  volumes in which they are sold leave little doubt as to the intentions of many  merchants and buyers.  </P> <P> In an informal survey of more than a dozen liquor stores and markets in  South-Central Los Angeles, a reporter found the pot scrubbers in every outlet,  usually displayed conspicuously near the front entrance, away from other  cleaning products.  </P> <P> In other instances, they were stored behind the counter because -- as a clerk  at one liquor store along Western Avenue put it -- "If we kept them on the  shelves they (crack addicts) would steal them."  </P> <P> When asked why his customers were purchasing the scrubbers, the owner of the  Western Avenue store, who identified himself only as Mike, began vigorously  scrubbing the counter. Almost as an afterthought, he lifted the scouring pad to  his nose and took a long sniff.  </P> <P> "Smoke, too," he said, shrugging.  </P> <P> Other merchants seemed similarly resigned to the sale of products used by gangs  and drug users.  </P> <P> "If we don't sell it, the guy down the street will," said one clerk at the L.A.  Slauson Swap Meet on Slauson Avenue in South-Central.  </P> <P> The clerk, who identified himself only as Rick, was explaining why he was  willing, upon request, to sew onto the back of a jacket the words "Playboy  Gangster Crips," the name of a faction of one of Los Angeles' most notorious  and deadly street gangs.  </P> <P> A few miles away, a tiny shop that specializes in decorative lighting featured  several cases filled with glass pipes that the owner insisted were intended for  smoking tobacco and herbs. There also was a supply of small plastic bags  ostensibly designed for storing jewelry.  </P> <P> "You don't sell cars so people can get run over," said the shop owner, who  spoke only on the condition that he not be identified. "But it happens. Does  that mean you stop selling cars?"  </P> <P> The problem extends beyond Los Angeles and Southern California.  </P> <P> In Chicago, Father George Clements, a Catholic priest who gained national  attention several years ago when he adopted a child, has mounted a highly  visible campaign to rid neighborhood stores of glass pipes and other items that  could be used to smoke crack. In Detroit, a newspaper writer was responsible  for halting gas station sales of pipes, tiny weighing scales and the miniature  zip-lock bags by printing in her column the names of the mostly suburbanite  station owners.  </P> <P> In Los Angeles, protests against drug paraphernalia sales have been less  visible. Police say they receive few complaints from citizens about stores that  sell these products, said Detective Dennis Zeuner of the Los Angeles Police  Department.  </P> <P> Zeuner, who coordinates the department's efforts to crack down on drug  paraphernalia, said officers are aware of the problem but focus their  enforcement efforts on stores that sell large numbers of items that can more  easily be categorized as drug-related. Most of these are stores that in the  1960s would have been called "head shops."  </P> <P> Under California's 7-year-old drug-paraphernalia law, Zeuner said, it would be  all but impossible to prosecute owners of, say, a liquor store that stocks  common household items that also are used to smoke crack. He cited the copper  mesh pot scrubbers as an example of the difficulties in pressing a case.  </P> <P> "Now there have got to be some people who buy those things to clean pots,"  Zeuner said, adding that some merchants may not know that the scouring pads  also are used to smoke crack. On the other hand, he added, some stores sell the  mesh already cut into pieces and packaged in little plastic bags for as much as  75 cents, about the price of a whole scourer.  </P> <P> Under most conditions, Zeuner said, merchants could be prosecuted only if they  advertise the scourers as crack paraphernalia and indicate they are selling  them solely for use with the drug, by selling pipes along with them, for  instance.  </P> <P> The same is true with other products such as disposable lighters or the cotton  balls and rum that some addicts use to make homemade torches. None of these  products, in and of themselves, can be classified as drug paraphernalia, even  though spent disposable lighters and burned-out homemade torches typically  litter areas where crack users congregate.  </P> <P> To discourage stores from selling items such as glass pipes and the small  plastic zip-lock bags, officers will sometimes visit store owners or managers,  show them a copy of the state law and ask them to sign it.  </P> <P> "In 99 cases out of a hundred," Zeuner said, "the stuff disappears because it's  not a large part of the guy's inventory."  </P> <P> Zeuner does not believe that any liquor store or market owner is getting rich  from selling scourers or lighters to crack users. Pipes, however, depending  upon the volume of a store's sales, can be very profitable, he said.  </P> <P> The smallest can be purchased for 50 cents and sold for up to $8, Zeuner said.  Some large, ornately shaped or decorated pipes go for considerably more.  </P> <P> Some anti-drug activists contend that the manufacturers of the products popular  among crack users are making big profits from the crack epidemic. But there are  no sales figures to support their claims.  </P> <P> Nancy Dedera, a spokeswoman for the Phoenix-based Dial Corp., manufacturer of  Brillo brand copper mesh pot scourers, which are found in stores in the Los  Angeles area, said sales did not increase as drug use surged. She insisted that  Dial's share of the pot-scourer market is tiny and referred a reporter to a  competitor.  </P> <P> A representative of the New Jersey-based Airwick Industries, maker of the Chore  Boy, the brand Dedera contended is the largest seller on the market, did not  return phone calls.  </P> <P> Profits made by manufacturers of gang wear or stores that stock the clothing  are similarly difficult to determine.  </P> <P> Some stores surveyed by The Times stocked only a single product -- bandannas,  typically -- and displayed just a few of the items.  </P> <P> Customers include hardened gang members and those who simply want to emulate  their style. Swap-meet vendors who sew gang names on caps and other apparel  said this represents only a small percentage of their business. Other store  owners said it was never their intention to serve gang members.  </P> <P> Dennis Conway, the owner of No Sweat, an athletic-wear shop on Manchester  Avenue, said that several months after he opened his business he was stunned to  discover some of his customers were gang members who adopted the logos of  professional and college sports teams as their own. Particular products are  chosen by gangs because a team name corresponds to the initials of their gang  faction, the color of the item corresponds with a favorite color of the gang,  or because the team's name sounds menacing.  </P> <P> "Gang members don't come in here throwing high signs, but they occasionally  come in," Conway said.  </P> <P> Conway said he has since learned much about what gang members want. One  South-Central gang that calls itself the Kitchen Crips wears clothing stamped  with KC for the Kansas City Chiefs, he said. Another Crips set that operates on  nearby Main Street likes the initials of Michigan State University because they  can also stand for Main Street University, a name the set has adopted for  itself, he said.  </P> <P> Police and school officials say the logos of teams such as the Los Angeles  Raiders and the Pittsburgh Steelers are popular with Los Angeles gangs. A Crips  faction that claims as its turf portions of Grape Street in Watts has adopted  Los Angeles Lakers apparel because much of it comes in purple, one of the  team's colors.  </P> <P> Anti-gang workers sympathize with merchants like Conway, who clearly are not  going out of their way to cater to gangs. But they are less tolerant of  merchants who, they are convinced, know what buyers intend to do with their  products.  </P> <P> Dan Guzman, a Community Youth Gang Services worker who speaks to schools and  parent groups about gang paraphernalia, said he has found in the racks of  convenience stores magazines that are unmistakably targeted to Latino gang  members. The letters and articles in one appear to be written in a code common  to some gang graffiti.  </P> <P> Guzman also has in his collection a catalogue from a store in Reseda that  advertises apparel adopted by gangs, including colored bandannas and  intricately woven cords that are worn on the hands and wrists of "cholas," or  girl gang members.  </P> <P> Other activists point to liquor store owners who stock blue bandannas in Crips  neighborhoods, knowing that blue is the gang's color, or red in a Bloods  neighborhood, knowing that Bloods favor red.  </P> <P> Last fall, volunteers in the Brotherhood Crusade's anti-gang, anti-drug "Taking  Our Community Back" campaign surveyed stores in a targeted area in  South-Central and asked store owners to remove blue bandannas wherever they  were found.  </P> <P> At one store, the owner refused to honor the request. The activists entered en  masse, demanded the bandannas be turned over, then burned them in the store's  parking lot.  </P> <P> Although schools have attempted to discourage gang-style clothing, prosecutors  say merchants who sell bandannas to rival Crips or Bloods, even knowingly, have  broken no laws. As is true for much of the drug paraphernalia, certain kinds of  apparel cannot be banned, they say, because many of the logos adopted by gangs  are the legitimate logos not only of sports teams but of clothing designers and  manufacturers.  </P> <P> For example, Calvin Klein apparel that carries the initials CK is favored by  Bloods who say the initials actually stand for Crip Killers. Athletic shoes and  other apparel bearing the initials of the manufacturer British Knight are  favored by Crips, who say the letters stand for Blood Killers.  </P> <P> The problem, some activists say, is that there are shootings almost every day  in Los Angeles in which the victims are targeted chiefly because they happen to  be wearing the wrong color or brand of clothing. In some cases merchants, they  insist, have a duty to warn law-abiding customers of the dangers.  </P> <P> V.G. Guinses, executive director of Save Every Youngster Youth Enterprise  Society, a 20-year-old anti-gang, anti-drug program in South-Central, cited the  case of a well-regarded high school student who was gunned down in a drive-by  shooting in Southwest Los Angeles about two years ago simply because he was  wearing blue shoelaces in an area claimed by Bloods sets.  </P> <P> "A person has a right to buy what he wants," Guinses said, "but he should at  least be told that it could get him killed."  </P> <P> Despite the killings and the notoriety of Los Angeles' street gangs, there are  some merchants in crime-ridden neighborhoods who insist they know nothing about  the problems that surround them.  </P> <P> At the J.C. Mini Mall/Broadway Swap Meet on South Broadway in South-Central, a  woman who refused to give her name agreed, without hesitation, to sew the word  "Crips" on a baseball hat at the request of a reporter.  </P> <P> Afterward, she said she had no idea what the name stands for, even though it  was scrawled in large letters among other graffiti on the front of the building  where she works.  </P> <P> "Gangs?" she asked. "(Are) gangs bad?"  </P></p>

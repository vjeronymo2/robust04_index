			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The head of state met with the press at the  Presidential Palace in Cotonou this morning. For two hours  President Soglo discussed serious national problems, such as the  social and political crisis, insecurity, and the effects of the  CFA franc devaluation. Indeed, one of the causes of the  political crisis is the devaluation, a development which is  being capitalized on by some politicians for their own ends.  This in fact is what the president stated in his introductory  remarks. President Nicephore Soglo stated that his government  was open to criticism, and was even prepared to mend its ways  and change direction, if need be. However, he noted his  opposition to abuse with the sole purpose of doing harm. Let us  listen to the head of state:    [Begin Soglo recording] The political scene here has been  characterized by unprecedented tension since the setting up of  new institutions in April 1991. These tensions stem from  various sources. The most important of these sources is,  obviously, the sudden devaluation of the CFA franc, a  devaluation which we neither wished for nor really planned or  prepared for. No head of state within the CFA franc zone wished  for or was prepared for it.    The difficulties arising from this situation -- i.e., the  drastic fall in our population's purchasing power --  unfortunately were capitalized on by some of our countrymen, in  an atmosphere typical of a pre-electioneering campaign period.  From verbal violence, they progressed to violence in general,  and even assaults. People simply forgot that impatience can be  a bad adviser, and that a nation divided against itself is bound  to perish. They forgot the principle of self-respect, and sold  our collective dignity dirt cheap. They then sought to trigger  an institutional war which, had it been prevailed, would not  have benefited either our budding democracy or even those who  sought to set it off. On the contrary, it would rather have  resulted in -- sooner or later -- a questioning of the hard won  freedom and social peace which was restored thanks to the  national conference. [passage omitted]    We cannot afford to forget so soon the disastrous effects of  the disorder of dirty politics, which gave our country the  unenviable tag of Africa's sick child in the early years of her  independence, and which served as a pretext for military  takeovers. We cannot forget the long tragedy from which we were  narrowly rescued by the February 1990 national conference. We  had to create a collective reawakening of the entire Beninese  people and a new sense of patriotism, solidarity, tolerance, and  collective dignity. We had to achieve, on some basic questions,  the broadest consensus possible, a prerequisite for a fresh  start. Since then we have been trying to establish a  law-abiding state together. The 11 December 1990 Constitution  clearly laid down the rules of the democratic game. It makes  political succession possible. Each one must agree to play the  game in a serene and loyal manner. No one has the right to  resort to violence. Power will henceforth be determined only  through the ballot box. Power is no longer attainable through  the gun. The real battle has a new stake -- public opinion.  Like any other kind of battle, it can be tough. But if we love  our country, we must ensure that such political clashes -- which  are necessary and unavoidable -- preserve our collective dignity  and honor and that they do not, at any time, call to question  the indispensable consensus on the nation's philosophy and major  objectives. [end recording]    On the problem of security, the head of state said he was  disturbed about the kidnapping of the Boukoumbe subprefect, and  stated that the government is doing everything possible to  secure his release. The president noted in passing that the  growing insecurity in our country is not the result of laxity or  a lack of firmness on the part of the government, but rather of  the refusal of some political groups and leaders to respect the  code of ethics laid down by the national conference.  Henceforth, all legal measures necessary for the security of  the state and the protection of life and property will be  implemented rigorously and firmly, the head of state stressed.    He took this opportunity to seriously warn students  responsible for acts of violence. While remaining open to  dialogue, he said, the government will not allow the university  to become a breeding ground for criminality, indiscipline, or  intolerance. The head of state also touched on the devaluation  of the CFA franc and on its consequences on citizens' living  conditions. Let us listen to him:    [Begin Soglo recording] Ladies and gentlemen, on 23 January,  before the nation, I reviewed the government's determination to  limit, as best as we can, the negative effects of the  devaluation on the various socioprofessional categories. In  this regard, I announced certain backup measures. Wage-earning  workers, including the public sector's civil servants, have  suffered greatly from the effects of the devaluation, as have  all the other components of the national community. Yet, they  are legitimately anxious to preserve their purchasing power. I  make it a point to commend them once again for their significant  contribution to the building up of New Benin and the  reconstruction of its economy. Furthermore, the government is  happy concerning the sense of responsibility exhibited by all  those among them who understood that their particular demands  can be met only within the framework of a general solution to  the nation's problems. The government remains open to dialogue  with all workers. However, I would like them all to understand  that Benin is a tiny country with limited resources, and that it  is impossible to consider only civil servants' demands and close  our eyes to the existence of industrialists, traders, and  farmers, who comprise 80 percent of the population.    Ladies and gentlemen, in my 19 September 1991 radio and  television address to the nation I stated that I will never lie  to the Beninese nation, because I consider my people a  population of mature and responsible adults. I firmly stick to  this pledge. The government is responsible for the interests of  the entire nation and each of its components. It neglects no  one, and similarly it will not favor any categories to the  detriment of others, or in contempt of our dignity. [end  recording]</p>

			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Paris shares the pain Many international investors remain overweight in French equities, which gives added spice to the outcome of this month's referendum on Maastricht. The implications of rejection are debated everywhere, discounted nowhere. Suffice it to say that the Paris stock market would fall - probably quite sharply - as the Mitterrand government pushed up interest rates to defend its hard-earned position inside the EMS. The idea that France might join a general realignment under the guise of a D-Mark revaluation looks implausible on fundamental grounds: if anything German costs have risen more than French ones since the last realignment in 1987. Suggestions that turmoil in financial markets following a No vote would soften the Bundesbank's heart - and accelerate a monetary easing across Europe - sound like so much wishful thinking. The more pertinent question is how much bounce is left in the bourse if the treaty gets the go-ahead. A combination of more encouraging opinion poll trends, the wheeling out of the political big guns, and a solid if unspectacular presidential performance on television on Thursday night seem to have convinced the market that voters are likely to say Yes. The differential between French government bonds and German bunds at the 10-year maturity had narrowed by Friday night to around 90 basis points, against a recent peak of 125-130 basis points. Dragged up in this fixed interest wake - and helped by the squeeze on investors caught with short positions - the CAC-40 Index ended the week 5.4 per cent higher. If all goes well on September 20 a further narrowing of the long-term interest rate differential might be expected, providing another modest boost to equities. Whether there would be much else to drive share prices, though, is another matter. Earnings forecasts for the current year have already been drastically scaled back, but the market has little confidence even in its revised estimates. As recent half-year results from the likes of Elf, Total and Accor have underlined demand in the economy has fallen away. There is certainly scope for export growth, but this is curtailed for the moment by weakness elsewhere. On fundamental grounds - and relative to other European markets - the French bourse looks historically cheap. But until there is a sharp and decisive downward move in German interest rates Paris looks unlikely to fulfil the promise of earlier this year.</p>

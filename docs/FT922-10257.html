			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / UK Company News: British Gas faces drop in profits THE COMMITMENT by British Gas to halve its share of the industrial gas market by 1995 could cut the company's profits by Pounds 100m a year, Mr Robert Evans, chairman, said. That would mean a reduction of 10 per cent in its income. He said the company had developed strategies - agreed with the Office of Fair Trading - to compensate for the drop in its UK business. Mr Evans added that British Gas was on target to earn 40 per cent of its profit from international exploration and production. He stressed that the price formula imposed by the OFT was a tough one. It will last five years and limit price increases to 5 percentage points below inflation.</p>

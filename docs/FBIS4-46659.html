Zakharov, Disaster Modeling </F> and Prediction Association; UDC 539.63:523.6+533.95]    [Abstract] Although a number of planetary bodies in the  solar system are riddled with meteorite craters, current notions  of the processes of formation that are associated with impact  craters are quite varied. Questions associated with the impact  of solids and with crater formation are also important in  planetology for studying planetary-surface structure and the  cosmogony of the solar system in general. That is why the study  of impact phenomena with physical and mathematical modeling  makes such an important contribution to our understanding of the  nature of craters and to the solution of problems involving the  danger meteorites present to spacecraft. The researchers here  examine high-velocity impact on homogenous surfaces, as well as  on layered surfaces, with a broad range of equations of state  for matter surrounding solid, liquid, and gases phases. Aspects  of the laboratory modeling of such impacts with laser pulses are  also studied. Figures 5, references 7 (Russian).</p>

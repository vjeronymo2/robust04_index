			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VIII. Regulatory Impact Statement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Introduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5 U.S.C. 601 through 612) unless the Secretary certifies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that a proposed rule would not have a significant economic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impact on a substantial number of small entities. For  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purposes of the RFA, all ESRD facilities are considered to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also, section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to prepare a regulatory impact analysis if a proposed rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may have a significant impact on the operations of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantial number of small rural hospitals. This analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must conform to the provisions of section 603 of the RFA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> small rural hospital as a hospital that is located outside  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of a Metropolitan Statistical Area and has fewer than 50  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with the provisions of Executive Order  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12866 this proposed rule was reviewed by the Office of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Management and Budget.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Water Quality Standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule would incorporate into regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing industry standards on the quality of water used in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dialysis to enable surveyors to accurately assess a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility's compliance with the standard on water quality.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The AAMI standards are the result of a collaborative effort  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by health professionals and industry representatives to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respond to clinical needs and to help ensure patient health  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and safety. It is our understanding that AAMI's recommended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maximum levels for water contaminants have been clearly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> defined and supported by scientific literature and developed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through industry consensus. Under the AAMI water standard,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the supplier/manufacturer of dialysis water treatment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment is responsible for assuring that the water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> produced by the system routinely does not exceed the maximum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowable chemical contaminant levels. Because AAMI's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acceptable contamination levels have been in effect since  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1982 and are recognized as medically acceptable standards,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> we believe that manufacturers have been producing, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities purchasing, equipment capable of meeting these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements. We understand that technology is in place for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all facilities to meet the AAMI water standard and solicit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments on this understanding. While variations in water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quality do typically occur, any changes that occur will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> handled through consultation with State and local water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authorities and safe purity levels ensured through continued  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitoring by the physician in charge of dialysis. Although  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contaminants in water used in dialysate may cause adverse  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> patient reactions, actual documented adverse incidents are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rare when water is monitored properly. Because the AAMI  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water quality standard represents long-standing acceptable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> medical practice, we believe the vast majority of facilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> already comply with this standard. Incorporation of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AAMI standard into regulations will help ensure patient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health and safety by providing surveyors with a measurable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard with which they may assess facility compliance,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> especially in the few facilities that do not voluntarily  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conform to the water quality guidelines adopted by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Reuse of Hemodialyzers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The AAMI ``Recommended Practice on Reuse'' does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> promote either single use or reuse of dialyzers. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guidelines were developed to acknowledge the widespread  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practice of reprocessing and provide recommendations for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> optimal hemodialyzer reprocessing. In January 1993, HCFA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Health Standard and Quality Bureau canvassed the 2,345  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicare certified ESRD facilities to determine if they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practiced reuse, and if so, the disinfecting protocols used.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sixty-five percent (1,532) of the facilities reported  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practicing reuse. Of these facilities, approximately 51  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent use renalin as the germicide, with two-thirds of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these facilities using an automated disinfecting system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Approximately 40 percent of the facilities reported using  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> formalin/formaldehyde as the germicide, with manual and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> automated systems receiving equal use. Approximately 9  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent of the facilities practicing reuse reported using  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> glutaraldehyde as the germicide, with the majority of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities using an automated disinfecting system. Less  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than 1 percent of the facilities use other disinfecting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methods.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because the 1993 AAMI guidelines do not differ  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significantly from the 1986 guidelines (which all Medicare  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participating facilities practicing reuse already must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meet), we believe that the great majority of the facilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practicing reuse would be in compliance with the new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards proposed in this regulation. The 1993 AAMI  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards were developed through a public forum and their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adoption was well publicized. They reflect the most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> up-to-date reuse procedures already practiced by many of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities, and we do not believe that incorporating the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1993 guidelines into our regulations, in and of itself,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would prompt any facility to begin or discontinue reuse.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We expect that each facility would respond to these new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards based on the relationship of these standards to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its current reuse practices and to factors such as whether  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or not a facility presently meets the standards or can meet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> them without extensive changes, and whether or not the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility can buy new filters in quantity less expensively  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than it can upgrade its reuse practices. As we said above,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 65 percent of the facilities are already reusing dialyzers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The major effect of this proposed rule would be to assure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that Medicare standards for reuse reflect safe and effective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Conclusion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because we are unable to predict the decisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities would make in response to this regulation, we are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unable to quantify the potential effect it would have. Some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beneficiaries may be reassured that HCFA has adopted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific water quality standards and updated its standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for reuse of hemodialyzers to ensure their health and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safety. However, we expect that there would be a negligible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effect on most beneficiaries and facilities since we believe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these revisions would make no major changes in current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility operation or patient experience. This proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule is not expected to result directly in any increases or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reductions in Medicare program expenditures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For these reasons, we have determined, and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary certifies that this proposed rule would not have a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant economic impact on a substantial number of small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entities and would not have a significant economic impact on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the operations of a substantial number of small rural  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospitals. Therefore, we are not preparing analyses for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> either the RFA or section 1102(b) of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

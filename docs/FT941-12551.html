			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Yorkshire Tyne Tees deficit less than feared Yorkshire-Tyne Tees, the ITV company, incurred lower-than-expected losses in the year to September 30 following problems with its advertising sales. When the deferred results were finally released yesterday the pre-tax deficit turned out to be Pounds 7.88m on turnover of Pounds 236.8m. In December, when the company warned of losses, it said they would not exceed Pounds 9.5m. But for a Pounds 3m property provision taken this time the deficit could have been even lower. Staff costs were reduced by Pounds 8.1m and operating costs were cut by Pounds 3.8m. Programmes sales reached a record Pounds 71.7m. Mr Ward Thomas, the recently appointed chairman, said it had been a difficult year 'because certain sales policies were pursued which damaged the company both in terms of its reputation and perception.' The final audited advertising sales figure of Pounds 150m was Pounds 34m less than the forecast given to the board at the start of the year and Pounds 20m less than the expection expressed to the board in the closing weeks of the financial year. As a result of the loss caused by rolled over debts on advertising, Yorkshire-Tyne Tees - in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a stake - will not be paying a final dividend. That leaves shareholders with 3.3p for the year compared with 12p, which included an 8.7p final. 'We are taking steps to ensure that deal debt is not part of our future trading practice,' said Mr Thomas, adding that all previous debt had now been dealt with. He warned that further stringent economies and a simplification of the management structure were on the way. Analysts expect the company to return to profit this year and a pre-tax figure of between Pounds 7m and Pounds 8m is thought possible. The company is joining other ITV companies in moving its year end to December.</p>

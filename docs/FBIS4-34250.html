			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Passages within quotation marks in Creole] </F>   [Excerpts] The FRAPH [Revolutionary Front for the Promotion  and Progress of Haiti] is on the way to becoming the Armed  Revolutionary Front of the Haitian People. The high  administrative staff of the FRAPH has decided to change strategy  as of next 21 June. During a press briefing held on 15 June,  Emmanuel Constant declared that the resistance to any U.S.  military intervention in Haiti has begun. Let us listen to the  report of Luckenson Jean:    [Begin recording] [Constant] "All of us are ready, are we  not, to die with our weapons in our hands. FRAPH, where are  you? [crowd shouts: "Here we are!"] FRAPH, where are you? [crowd  shouts: "Here we are!"] FRAPH, where are you? [crowd shouts:  "Here we are!"] Divisions? [crowd shouts: "No!"] Divisions?  [crowd shouts: "No!"] Solidarity? [crowd shouts: "Yes!"]"    [Jean] "On next 21 June, FRAPH will stand for the Armed  Revolutionary Front of the Haitian People. As of the afternoon  of 15 June, FRAPH declared that the national resistance against  the enemy has begun. The FRAPH leader asked all foreigners  living in the country not to leave the national territory as a  sign of solidarity with the Haitian people, to not to follow the  evacuation communique issued by the U.S. Embassy. These  statements were made by Toto Constant in his home at about 1500."    [Constant] Today, we, together, solemnly declare that the  Haitian resistance has begun. First, it will be passive  resistance. Then, if that does not work and the international  community and President Clinton do not hear our cry of alarm, we  will begin active resistance. We invite the national and  international press to a news conference that will be held on  Tuesday, 21 June at 1400, not by the FRAPH, but by the Armed  Revolutionary Front of the Haitian People.    [Jean] "Constant criticized U.S. President Clinton, UN  Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, and Mr. Gray, the new  person in charge of the Haitian file. He asked them to review  their decisions so Haiti does not turn into Somalia. Several  children, several small Haitian children, have already died as a  result of the negative effects of the embargo. FRAPH  congratulated the commander in chief of the Army and the police  chief; it asked them to remain steadfast, and supported the  communique on the state of emergency of the third provisional  government not acknowledged by the international community and  which most parliamentarians term an abuse of authority.    ``According to the FRAPH leader, the foreign intervention  which hangs over the country like the sword of Damocles is  unfair and criminal. Constant thinks the intervention is aimed  at assassinating FRAPH members and the civilian population.''    [Constant] [passage omitted] We in FRAPH fully support the  Haitian Armed Forces, the Port-au-Prince police, and provisional  President Emile Jonassaint within the scope of providing  security for the foreign and national population.    [Jean] [passage omitted] They and all political parties are  ready to order a state of siege throughout the national  territory. Constant asked the Haitian people to defend the  achievements of 1946, 1957, 1991, and even 1994 without  violence. FRAPH finds itself compelled to secure its members  and they will be armed with traditional weapons such as pikes,  potions, and so on. [passage omitted]    [Constant] We need a government [pauses] we need a return to  constitutional order of the center-right nature, but not a  populist return to constitutional order. If Mr. Gray continues  to destroy diplomacy, as far as we are concerned, we have  decided to die innocently and unfairly. [passage omitted]    [Jean] "The Bible says a house divided against itself shall  fall. Constant says he has no disagreement with Chamblain and  there is no division within FRAPH, contrary to what they are  saying. Concerning the other parallel parties, such as the  Assembly of Democrats for the Republic, the Volunteers for  National Security, and the Capois Lamort Organization [OCL],  Constant said they are all members of the great 30 September  [1991] family who have different views on the situation.    ``Toto Constant, who was wearing a gray suit and who held a  one and one half year-old girl, who was wearing a white dress,  stated that the child represented the innocence of the Haitian  people. We should tell you there was much suspense among the  audience made up of FRAPH members coming from various areas in  the capital. The conference was not held in the living room,  like what is usually done, but in the yard under a custard apple  tree. Chamblain and the leader of the OCL were not present at  this conference. Luckenson Jean for Signal FM." [end recording]    It should be noted that the provisional government pointed  out last month that only the Army and the police are recognized  as armed forces by the Haitian Constitution.</p>

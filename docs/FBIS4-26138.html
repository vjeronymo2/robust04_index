			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 19 (XINHUA) -- South Korea began full  preparations today for the inter-Korean summit meeting between  South Korean President Kim Yong-sam and President Kim Il-song of  the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).    President Kim Yong-sam on Saturday [18 June] accepted the  proposal made by President Kim Il-song to hold talks aimed at  resolving the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula.    South Korea's National Unification Board (NUB) has formed a  working-level task force headed by Vice-Minister song Yong-tae  and including other high-ranking officials.    The task force is making a variety of preparations for the  summit, said an NUB official, who added that its members are now  engaged in discussions of details, such as the date and venue of  the summit.    Meanwhile, the South Korean Government has decided to hold a  high-level strategy meeting on Monday to coordinate its position  on the inter-Korean summit and discuss measures for dealing with  the DPRK's nuclear issue.    South Korea and the DPRK are expected to hold working-level  talks soon to discuss details relating to the summit, according  to official sources here.    In a related development, former U.S. President Jimmy Carter  left here today for home, following his six-day visit to  Pyongyang and Seoul.    On Saturday, Carter conveyed DPRK President Kim Il-song's  proposal for a summit to South Korean President Kim Yong-sam,  who accepted immediately.    During his stay on the Korean peninsula, Carter exchanged  views with South Korean and DPRK leaders on the nuclear issue in  a bid to break the deadlock.</p>

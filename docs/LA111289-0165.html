			<p><P> November 12, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> MONTCLAIR PREP KEEPS ITS POISE, PERFECT RECORD  </P> <P> Question: When in 1989 has the outcome of a Montclair Prep football game come  down to an onside kick with barely a minute left?  </P> <P> Answer: Never.  </P> <P> That is, of course, before Saturday night's emotional contest with Alpha League  rival Village Christian at Pierce College.  </P> <P> This one, in fact, did come down to an onside kick. But the Mounties recovered  the ball, smothering an upset bid by the courageous Crusaders, 28-20, to  complete the regular season with a flawless 10-0 mark heading into the Division  IX playoffs.  </P> <P> "I'm proud of my kids," Village Christian Coach Mike Plaisance said. "I'm never  happy with a loser, but I couldn't ask for a better game."  </P> <P> That he couldn't. Although Montclair Prep led at halftime, 14-12, Mark Vail (12  of 23, 177 yards), the Crusaders' sophomore quarterback, had picked apart a  flustered Mountie secondary, and eyebrows were being raised.  </P> <P> The Mounties, though, as they have all year, went to their strengths -- Michael  Jones, who finished with 149 yards in 23 carries and one touchdown, and Derek  Sparks, who came back from a neck injury at halftime to finish with 158 yards  in 14 carries. Sparks scored with just 5:47 left to give Montclair Prep a 28-12  lead.  </P> <P> Ever the competitor, Vail, who ran for one touchdown and threw for two more,  marched Village Christian 58 yards in four plays, capping the drive with a  nine-yard touchdown pass to Mark Bates with just 1:11 left to account for the  final score.  </P> <P> The onside kick followed and Montclair Prep had its victory. The only question  left for Village Christian (5-5, 2-3), which headed home for the season: Do  moral victories count? BRIAN MURPHY  </P></p>

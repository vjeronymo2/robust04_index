			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / BBC and Sky talk on news service THE BBC is talking to Sky Television about collaboration over 24-hours-a-day satellite television news in the UK. The discussions are the latest sign of growing co-operation between the BBC and the satellite broadcaster after last month's successful joint bid for television rights to football's Premier League. Talks are at an early stage, but both sides believe it would be foolish to have two competing satellite news channels in the UK. In February Sir Michael Checkland, BBC director-general, made clear that he wanted to see the corporation operating a round-the-clock satellite television news service by next year. Latest thinking at the BBC is that the UK service should be distinct from the World Television Service news already available in Asia and Africa. Sky News is now accepted as an integral part of the six-channel Sky television package - a venture in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a significant stake. Although the losses of Sky News have been reduced, the channel is expected to lose about Pounds 13m this year. The possibilities being discussed include turning Sky News into a joint venture - the BBC-Sky News - or even producing the channel from the BBC but using the existing Sky presenters. Meanwhile, the latest accounts filed by British Sky Broadcasting show losses of Pounds 759m for the first 37 weeks after the merger of Sky and BSB in November 1990. The company is now profitable, although that has been achieved by writing off close to Pounds 1bn of excess costs in the two former rivals. The accounts show that the BSkyB investors are not expecting significant net cash inflows or net operating profits before 1994.</p>

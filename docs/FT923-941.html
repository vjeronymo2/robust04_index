			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Observer: For the record If there is one obvious lesson to be drawn from the Blue Arrow fiasco, it's not to leave your Filofax lying around, and especially not on the boardroom table. The career of Mitchell Fromstein, the US boss of Blue Arrow's most important Manpower business, ended temporarily after his missing Filofax fell into the hands of Blue Arrow chairman Tony Berry. It triggered Fromstein's dismissal. According to yesterday's DTI report into Blue Arrow, Berry was 'extremely shocked' and 'numb' after he had read the plans that Fromstein had in mind. Leaving aside the question of the propriety of reading someone else's Filofax, Observer is much more puzzled by what someone as un-yuppie-like as 64-year-old Fromstein was doing with a bulging Filofax in the first place.</p>

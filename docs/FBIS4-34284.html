			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "A Historic Agreement"] </F>   [Text] Relations between states, just as friendship between  common mortals, require constant attention, repair, and  maintenance, particularly in the case of neighboring countries  such as Argentina and Uruguay. The two countries are located in  the vast geopolitical space created by the River Plate basin,  which has a history that in many aspects unites them and in  other cases separates them, giving each country its own and  distinct personality. However, they also have shared economic  interests that soon will materialize in Mercosur [Common Market  of the South].    As is common in all families, relations between the two  nations have had their ups and downs. But if we have to make a  list of elements that have not contributed to our family's  harmony, it is probable that we will make a rather short list  and include mostly minor items and some prejudices, which are  unjustified but inevitable in peoples' relations. An outstanding  place in the list probably will be occupied by the important and  delicate issue of the administration and use of the River Plate.  The issue is not new. It started with the Montevideo and Buenos  Aires ports' rivalry during the vice royalty.    The suspicions and concerns rooted in the origins of our  shared history were stirred by an extraordinary theory  maintained by an Argentine foreign minister at the beginning of  the century. Estanislao Zevallos maintained that Uruguay's  borders were marked "by the line of the lowest River Plate  tides," that is, the dry coast. We must admit, however, that  such an astounding opinion never spread. This fact was confirmed  with the signing of the Ramirez-Saenz Pena Protocol in January  1910. During the following decades the two countries advanced  gradually and methodically, overcoming more than one political  storm, toward the creation of a juridical framework for  resolving pending issues constructively.    The result of these efforts was the River Plate and Maritime  Front Treaty signed by Argentina and Uruguay in November 1973.  It can be said that the agreement was the result of particularly  favorable circumstances, but it is also true that it represented  the final stage of a long and historic process of convergence.  The treaty's prologue establishes that the document's main  purpose is to iron out difficulties derived from "all situations  lacking juridical definition on the exercise of equal rights on  the River Plate."    The treaty still is criticized in both countries. Those who  criticize it are increasingly fewer, however. But no one can  deny that the treaty established a solid framework of  principles, norms, and institutions (bilateral commissions) that  have contributed to the integral use of this vast and shared  river and maritime area.    There is no doubt, then, that what was agreed on by both  parties in the River Plate Administrating Commission on the  dredging of the Martin Garcia channel, and the upcoming meeting  of Presidents Carlos Menem and Luis Alberto Lacalle to  officially present the documents on conditions for bidding on  the channel dredging, have a major historic, economic, and  political importance. The work that will be implemented jointly  by Argentina and Uruguay is not only part of one of the biggest  binational projects that will be undertaken within the treaty's  framework. The work also will represent a large contribution by  both River Plate countries to the vast River Plate basin's  development.    The future of Mercosur and the Paraguay-Parana Waterway  (Puerto Caceres-Nueva Palmira) depend to a good extent on free  and cheap access for maritime transport services required to  link producers with their trade partners abroad. The key to the  river system has always been, and will continue to be, the River  Plate's navigation channels. The work also will contribute to  the development of Argentine and Uruguayan ports on the Uruguay  River, which are not part of the Paraguay-Parana waterway but  also have great development possibilities.    The Martin Garcia channel's dredging is a job that will  benefit all river system users located upriver. Uruguay is only  one of them and not precisely the most important user. It also  will complement other projects now in the process of  implementation.    The channel dredging agreement signed between Argentina and  Uruguay represents a victory for common sense and the spirit of  cooperation. The two River Plate countries' governments have  constructively overcome difficult obstacles and agreed in  advance to a shared undertaking that will benefit their peoples  in addition to all the other people living in the River Plate  basin.</p>

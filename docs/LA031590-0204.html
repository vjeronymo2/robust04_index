			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIGIURI, WYNALDA FINALLY SIGN CONTRACTS WITH SOCCER FEDERATION  </P> <P> The impasse between the U.S. Soccer Federation and Paul Caligiuri ended  Wednesday with the announcement that the midfielder from Santa Monica has  signed a standard player's contract.  </P> <P> At the same time, the federation announced at a news conference in New York  that forward Eric Wynalda of Westlake Village also has signed.  </P> <P> Caligiuri, 25, and Wynalda, 20, have been two of the most effective players in  preparation for the U. S. national team's first World Cup in 40 years this  summer in Italy. Caligiuri scored one goal and assisted on another in  Saturday's 2-1 victory over Finland at Tampa, Fla.  </P> <P> Initially offered a contract in December, Caligiuri refused to sign because of  a requirement that professional teams pay transfer fees to the USSF if they  sign U.S. players before the contract expires.  </P> <P> Caligiuri, who previously played in West Germany, wanted to be released from  the contract after the World Cup. The USSF has the players under contract for  the remainder of this year with an option for next year. RANDY HARVEY  </P></p>

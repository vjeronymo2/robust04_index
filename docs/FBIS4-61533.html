			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Konstantin Pribytkov] </F>   [Text] Geneva 8 May TASS -- "Since the Commonwealth is now  officially recognized and has the status of observer in the  United Nations, this means that the CIS should take an active  part in all processes developing in the world community," said  CIS executive secretary Ivan Korotechnya, who visited the U.N.  European branch earlier this week.    Summing up the results of his visit in an interview with  TASS, Korotechnya noted that the point at issue was actually  "participation by the CIS, in the capacity of observer, in all  meetings of international organizations having their  representative offices in Geneva." This would enable the  Commonwealth to spell out its vision of certain issues at the  international level and to express its position on these issues.    During his trip to Geneva, Korotechnya signed on behalf of  the CIS secretariat an agreement on cooperation with the  secretariat of the U.N. Conference for Trade and Development  (UNCTAD), held talks with executive secretary of the European  Economic Commission Yves Berthelot and Director General of the  World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Arpad Bogsch.    "The agreement with the UNCTAD defines directions for  further  joint work and mutual interests," the CIS executive secretary  said, referring to regular consultations, exchange of  information, technical assistance. The visit to the European  Economic Commission laid the foundation for further cooperation.  As for the WIPO, a meeting is scheduled to be held in the  Belarusian capital Minsk in a month and a half, which is to draw  plenipotentiary envoys of CIS member-countries and to be  attended by Bogsch. The meeting is to concentrate on  coordination in protection of intellectual property rights.    "The recognition by the United Nations of the CIS as a  regional association prompted us to approve at our latest  meeting in Moscow a plan of measures aiming to develop  international contacts," Korotechnya reported. The recent visit  by U.N. Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali to the CIS  headquarters in Minsk proved to the United Nations' interest in  cooperation with the CIS. "I do not rule out that in prospect a  representative office of the CIS as a whole will be set up in  Geneva," the executive secretary noted. "But for this, we need a  decision by the council of heads of government or of heads of  state," he added.    At present, each of the newly-independent states is  establishing ties with U.N. structures separately, and yet "we  are also looked at as the Commonwealth on the whole,"  Korotechnya pointed out. Orienting itself for international  contacts, the CIS secretariat does not intend by any means "to  influence any bilateral ties": All CIS member-countries have  the right to choose their partners on their own. The point at  issue is just cooperation that could be profitable for the  entire Commonwealth.    At the latest meeting of CIS heads of state and government  in  Moscow, "we took a serious step towards consolidation and  strengthening of the Commonwealth," the CIS executive secretary  said. "We have reached the level of Commonwealth when the  member-states are gathering at the table not just to sign some  document," he emphasised. At the same time, all states are  sovereign, therefore we should search for a consensus when  solving our problems. "We should take counsel and reach  agreement -- this is the main essence of the Commonwealth. This  is perhaps the core of democracy and of all processes currently  underway in our society," Korotechnya pointed out.</p>

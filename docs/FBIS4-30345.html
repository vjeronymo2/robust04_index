			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 27 KYODO -- The main opposition Liberal  Democratic Party (LDP) and the second largest opposition Social  Democratic Party (SDP) [Social Democratic Party of Japan --  SDPJ] are going to hold a party head meeting Monday [27 June]  morning following the resignation of the entire minority cabinet  of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, party officials said.    LDP President Yohei Kono and SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama  are scheduled to meet at 10 AM at the Diet building, the  officials said. The LDP has proposed a summit meeting among  leaders of the LDP, the SDP and the new party Sakigake on  Sunday. LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori made the proposal at  a meeting with SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo.    Mori told Kubo the LDP intends to settle the latest  political  chaos with the three parties. Mori added that a new prime  minister should be chosen as soon as possible, the officials  said.    Later in the day, the SDP decided to accept the LDP's  proposal at a party leadership meeting, the officials said. But  the New Party Sakigake has not immediately accepted the  proposal. Hiroyuki Sonoda, secretary general of Sakigake, said  in a meeting with Mori that Sakigake will watch consultations  between the LDP and the SDP, they said.    The LDP earlier the same day decided to set a priority on  consultations with the SDP and Sakigake toward setting up a new  government at a party leadership meeting, the officials said.    LDP President Kono has showed the willingness for a tie-up  between the LDP and the SDP together with Sakigake during a TV  program on Sunday morning.    SDP Chairman Murayama said Sunday during a TV program that  he  will also consider a possible tie-up between the LDP and the  SDP. However, SDP's Kubo told reporters after the meeting with  Mori that the proposed summit meeting does not mean the start of  consultations toward setting up a new government. Kubo also  said the SDP is ready to propose a meeting with outgoing Prime  Minister Hata representing the coalition.    Meanwhile, Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of Hata's  Shinseito, appeared to reject consultations with the SDP over  realliance for the time being. Ozawa urged the LDP and the SDP  to offer their own vision of a new government to succeed Hata's  minority coalition administration.</p>

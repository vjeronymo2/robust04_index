Interested in increasing its  commercial ties with Asian countries, the Brazilian Foreign  Ministry has included Vietnam among the countries with which it  intends to step up trade. Situated in a region showing the  highest commercial growth rate in the world, Vietnam, from  Itamarati's viewpoint, may also become an important Brazilian  partner in the oil field.  <H5>  Cats </H5>   In the next few months the first Brazilian commercial  mission  will travel to Vietnam to seek new markets for the Brazilian  exporters. Foreign Minister Celso Amorim said: "Brazil does  not want to remain behind. This is why we want to approach the  Asian tigers while they are still cats." He explained that the  government wants to step up commercial relations with the  remaining countries of the region, as is already the case with  China.    Currently, trade with Asia represents only 16 percent of the  total volume of Brazilian imports and exports. Amorin said:  "Those countries' potential is enormous, and we want to secure  a good portion of that market." The minister revealed that the  Brazilian mission will also have a political nature. The  Brazilian Government wants to establish an embassy in Hanoi to  show that it intends to tighten diplomatic relations between the  two countries. Currently, the Brazilian Embassy in Singapore is  in charge of the diplomatic contacts with Vietnam.    A diplomat in charge of arranging the visit to Vietnam  commented: "Above all, the Brazilian mission has an exploratory  nature. We know little about that country and want to open new  commercial fronts." According to the diplomat, by opening its  economy, Vietnam will offer Brazilian businessmen new  opportunities, especially in the foodstuff and heavy machinery  fields. He added: "During the first talks we had regarding the  trip, local authorities recalled that Vietnam has already  purchased Brazilian-made tractors, but that they lack spare  parts for them."    Last year Brazilian exports to that country amounted to $4.2  million, while imports amounted to approximately $13.5 million.  During the first three months of 1993, Brazil imported some $2.7  million worth of rice which is equivalent to 11,900 tonnes of  rice. The chemical and industrial equipment industries were  responsible for most of the Brazilian exports to Vietnam.  <H5>  Petroleum </H5>   Petrobras [Brazilian Petroleum Corporation], Braspetro  [Petrobras International, Inc.], and Furnas [Furnas Electric  Power Plant, Inc.] have expressed interest in the mission due to  Vietnam's oil reserves. Representatives of the three companies  will comprise the mission that will leave for Vietnam during the  second half of April. Petrobras has already informed the  Brazilian diplomats that it wants to contact Vietnamese  enterprises of the lubricant industry.    Brazilian construction companies are also interested in  Vietnam, with a population of some 70 million inhabitants, that  is in the process of consolidating the adoption of a market  economy. The Andrade Gutierrez, Camargo Correia, and Norberto  Odebrecht companies will also be represented in the commercial  mission. Andrade Gutierrez Director General Ildeu Olyntho de  Freitas asserted: "We are closely watching the opening of the  Vietnamese economy and want more information on the fields in  which we can work." He admitted the possibility of the company  participating in the construction of infrastructure projects in  that Asian country. The businessman said: "Right now, we know  little about Vietnam but we want to work in that region."</p>

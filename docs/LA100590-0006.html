			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AIR AMERICA AND DRUGS IN LAOS  </P> <P> I would much rather laugh at the antics of Mel Gibson and Robert Downey than  bemoan the U.S. government and its involvement with opium trafficking.  </P> <P> Turning a blind eye to the goings-on of our government isn't "American." It  isn't "un-American" to giggle at the mistakes of our CIA, either. People still  joke about Nixon and you can't tell me that is un-American.  </P> <P> I love the United States and never want to live anywhere else. That doesn't  mean I am one of those Wally George fanatics and believe blindly in everything  the government tells me.  </P> <P> Laughing at days gone by is a good way to get beyond them.  </P> <P> TRISH BASSETT  </P> <P> Upland  </P></p>

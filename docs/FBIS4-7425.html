			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Shalom Mapagu and Ellen Tordesillas] </F>   [Text] Legislators from the People's Republic of China  yesterday told their Filipino counterparts that there is no  reason to be alarmed over reports that the People's Republic of  China has increased its military budget by 20 percent.    This, they said, did not mean there was an arms buildup in  the disputed Spratly Islands or anywhere else in the region.  Rather, the increase was dictated by inflation.    "The cost of goods are rising in China," said Zhu Liang,  chairman of the foreign affairs and defense committees of the  PRC's National People's Congress.    The Spratlys are being claimed in part or wholly by the  Philippines, PRC, Taiwan, Malaysia, Brunei, and Vietnam. The  Philippines and Vietnam have repeatedly expressed concern over  reports that China has been increasing its military presence in  this disputed territory.    "Reports that we are expanding our military capabilities  have  been reaching the West. We think this is nothing but rumor,"  said Zhu Liang.    The Chinese legislator said disputes between PRC and other  countries "should be settled through peaceful negotiations."    Zhu Liang emphasized that the Mainland China opposes  military  aggression. "Not now, not even in the future," he said.    Liang was accompanied during the meeting with Filipino  legislators by six of his colleagues in the National People's  Congress.    He met with the House Committee on Foreign Affairs chaired  by  Rep. Jaime Lopez (Laban [Lakas ng Bayan -- People's Power],  Manila).    Lopez hoped the Philippines' partnership and cooperation  with  China "will succeed very soon." He expressed confidence that  China's participation in the General Agreement on Tariffs and  Trade would greatly enhance trade potentials in the Asia-Pacific  Region.    In the Senate, Sen. Blas Ople yesterday said the "wound"  inflic??e recent visit here of .se President Li Teng-hui on  Philippine-China relations has apparently been healed as  manifested by the current visit of the Chinese parliamentarians.    Ople, who accompanied the visiting parliamentarians to  Malacanang yesterday, said, the visit "means they have given  time for these irritations to heal."    The parliamentarians were scheduled to come February but  canceled it when President Ramos received Li who passed by Subic  Bay last 9 February.    "This means that Philippine-China relations can withstand a  few challenges from time to time," Ople said.</p>

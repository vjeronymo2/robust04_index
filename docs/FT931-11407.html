			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Army denies attempt on Khmer Rouge HQ THE CAMBODIAN government yesterday denied its latest military offensive was aimed at capturing the Khmer Rouge headquarters near the Thai border, and suggested UN troops be repositioned to act as a 'buffer' between government forces and the guerrillas. The government said a series of recent attacks on Khmer Rouge positions in northern and western Cambodia were aimed at driving the guerrillas back to the territory they held before all the country's main factions signed a ceasefire and peace agreement in Paris in October 1991. They were responding to accusations by UN peacekeepers on Monday they were engaged in a big offensive which could not be justified on grounds of self-defence. 'It's a purely defensive activity,' Mr Khieu Kanharith, senior adviser to prime minister Hun Sen, said. 'Now the mission is complete. It's a great success.' Gen Pann Thay, military spokesman, said the offensive was aimed at protecting villagers working on the rice harvest and at forcing back Khmer Rouge artillery shelling government positions. He said there was no plan to take the gem-mining town of Pailin, regarded as the Khmer Rouge headquarters, but added: 'We finish right now, but if the Khmer Rouge launch an offensive against us we have to attack them again.' The UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia (Untac) seems unlikely to accept the idea of placing its 16,000 troops as a buffer between the country's warring factions.</p>

			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / International Company News: BHP to sell fibre-optics unit to US group Broken Hill Proprietary, the Australian resources group, is to sell AOFR, its fibre-optics products group, to Minneapolis-based ADC Telecommunications for an undisclosed sum, writes Nikki Tait in Sydney. BHP said the business - which claims to be the world's largest producer of fibre-optic couplers - required an established industry parent to maximise its growth potential, and ADC was better suited to this role. BHP acquired the business in 1990. Separately, the company announced that Mr Frederic Hamilton, founder of the Hamilton Oil business which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of BHP, would step down as chief executive of the unit in December. Mr Hamilton will remain chairman, and the chief executive's role will be split between Mr James Riemersma, general manager of the Europe, Africa and Middle East division, and Mr Edward Blair, general manager of the Americas division.</p>

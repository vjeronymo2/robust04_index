			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Menem to assure Europe of Argentina's growth potential PRESIDENT Carlos Menem of Argentina is describing his visit to Europe this week as a publicity offensive, 'to explain to the Europeans why Argentina has become a country of stability and growth'. He is anxious to dispel doubts about the depth and sustainability of sweeping economic liberalisation that reduced inflation and helped the economy grow 5 per cent last year. Monthly inflation, down to 0.6 per cent in December, rose to 3 per cent in January, threatening an economic strategy that seeks to hold inflation down to international levels. Mr Menem's trip, during which he will not sign any significant agreements, will include his first official visit to the European Community headquarters in Brussels tomorrow. It will end in Paris next Tuesday after Mr Menem has met President Francois Mitterrand. He is unlikely to make headway in Argentina's overriding trade dispute with Brussels: the Community's subsidised farm exports. Cheap EC exports have undercut Argentina's grain and beef exports. None the less, Argentina clearly wants to develop its trade, investment and political ties with the Community. The EC is Argentina's largest trade partner, buying Dollars 3.7bn worth of Argentine goods in 1990, almost one-third of its exports. Moreover, Mr Menem wants to convince European multinationals to invest in Argentina and take part in its privatisation programme. So far it has only attracted second-rate European state-owned companies, which now run the national airline and telephone network. Argentina plans to sell control of all its state companies for Dollars 3.5bn by the end of this year and is determined to attract a better class of investor. Mr Menem also intends to realign foreign policy, which he tilted heavily towards Washington after taking office in 1989, reversing Argentina's traditionally pro-European policy. Mr Menem said: 'Our relations with Europe have always been excellent, while our relations with the US used to be terrible, so everyone thinks our policies privilege them and maybe the Europeans are upset about that.'</p>

Joe Buonaiuto, 40, president of the Sacramento Municipal Utility District's  Board of Directors, said he would seek the Democratic nomination to challenge  Assemblyman Tim Leslie (R-Carmichael), who he described as too conservative and  unrepresentative of mainstream voters.  </P> <P> Saying he believes that lawmakers have been bought like prostitutes by special  interest groups, Buonaiuto waved a red light bulb as he addressed reporters on  the Capitol steps. "This red light ought to be up there on that white dome," he  said. "This is the red light district. This is the Mustang Ranch. This is the  biggest little whorehouse in California."  </P></p>

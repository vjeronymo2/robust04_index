			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: ANC takes the heat out of mining policy debate - Chest-thumping has given place to level-headed discussions After an inauspicious start in January, the African National Congress and the South African mining industry have stopped chest-thumping and begun what seem to be level-headed discussions about the country's future mining and minerals policy. The ANC wants the establishment of a new forum to include government, labour and a wider representation of the industry than the Chamber of Mines - made up of the leading mining houses but not foreign companies like RTZ and Shell. Joint technical committees are already tackling issues such as mineral rights, the environment, and safety, while the ANC has instructed its newly established Minerals and Energy Policy Centre to draw up a small-mining policy. These developments stand in stark contrast to the stormy briefing in late January when the ANC presented its draft policy to the industry. Mining executives vented their spleen at what they understood to be plans for the nationalisation of mineral rights and state intervention in minerals marketing. In reality, the ANC talks only of the 'reversion' of mineral rights to the state and the creation of a state minerals marketing auditor, although Mr Paul Jourdan, co-ordinator of mineral and energy policy, has done much to clarify its position after the furore. The latest draft stresses the importance of consulting industry and omits wild estimates of extra revenue that might be raised by the 'national marketing' of minerals. Mr Jourdan stresses that the ANC intends only to bring the country's mineral rights regime in line with public ownership that exists in some US states, Canada and Australia, and that has to be negotiated. Confusion about minerals marketing stemmed from a proposal for a state marketing corporation put forward by the Macro-Economic Research Group, a left-wing ANC-aligned think-tank, which never made it to draft policy, while the ANC was unaware that the South African Reserve Bank already monitored mineral exports daily. Mr Nick Segal, economics spokesman for the chamber, says the two parties can now focus on the central issue: 'The maintenance of a healthy mining industry which includes more players than in the past.' The chamber emphasises how precarious the mining business can be with employment on gold and coal mines having declined from more than 600,000 to 390,000 between 1989 and 1993, and the sector's contribution to gross domestic product shrunk from more than 16 per cent in 1986 to less than 10 per cent in 1992. The mines have worked hard to stay in business, investing R50bn (Dollars 14bn) in new projects in the past decade, improving productivity, and building a more constructive relationship with labour. The chamber says a sound future will depend on a stable economic and fiscal environment aimed at supporting existing mines and encouraging new investment. In general, the ANC finds little fault with the chamber's analysis and has come to appreciate that the country's huge mineral wealth is a mixed blessing in some ways. The rigours of the global mining business are such that undisciplined exploitation of the lion's share of world chrome, platinum, and vanadium reserves that South Africa has would see commodity prices tumble and bring the industry to its knees. However, a sense of injustice pervades ANC thinking on an industry that it sees as dominated for too long by a small clique of white-owned corporations. If mining, which still contributes nearly three quarters of foreign exchange earnings, is to provide the backbone of reconstruction and development, which Mr Jourdan believes it can, the industry will need new sticks and carrots to take up the challenge. Large new capital projects given the go-ahead in the past 18 months have created precious few jobs while the ANC argues the stranglehold the chamber's members have over South Africa's most attractive mineral rights precludes the development of small-scale mining businesses and deters foreign investment. Passing mineral rights ownership from business to the state is a vital first step. The long tenure of mineral rights vital for developing high-risk long-term projects can be met by tailoring mining leases to industry needs, Mr Jourdan argues. Mr Segal says there is no question of the chamber defending the status quo for the sake of it, but the complex mixed mineral rights regime, developing over 100 years, remains the cornerstone of the industry and underpins its ability to mount deep-level, long-term projects. He believes the absence of small-scale mining is overstated by the ANC - South Africa has dozens of small gold and coal operators - and encouragement of the sector has to be squared with the country's unique geology, which lends itself to large mining operations. He adds: 'There is scope for small-scale mining, for which access to mineral rights may be an impediment, but so are finance, safety and environmental considerations. We have work to do.'</p>

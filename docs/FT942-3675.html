			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / European Elections '94: El Pais - Editorial electorate The accumulated discredit from corruption scandals has eaten away at the Socialist vote on the centre and the left, and last-minute appeals to ideological fidelity, to avoid the triumph of the right, failed to move a demotivated and demoralised electorate . . . The government cannot avoid taking these results into account: Felipe Gonzalez must call a vote of confidence in parliament immediately, because he can only continue governing after yesterday's setback if he makes certain of having the support to guarantee an outright majority . . . The Popular party has inflicted a serious defeat on the Socialists. This is an important political and personal success for Jose Maria Aznar . . . Whatever turns out to be the way forward, the PP has won the right to be taken into account in the fundamental decisions of government and to participate in drawing up the political timetable for the future.</p>

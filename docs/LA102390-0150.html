			<p><P> October 23, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> EXHIBITORS HOPE 'THIS IS OUR YARD' HITS HOME;  </P> <P> AIDS STORIES: A 20-PHOTO EXHIBIT PICTURES THE TRAGEDY AND HOPE OF THOSE WITH  THE DISEASE.  </P> <P> Two Orange County artists have set out on a mission of sorts, a campaign of  pictures and words designed to help counter what they feel is a pervasive  atmosphere of ignorance, fear and hysteria shrouding the AIDS epidemic.  </P> <P> Mary-Linn Hughes and Jerry McGrath have assembled a traveling exhibit of  photographic portraits of county residents who have AIDS or have tested  positive for HIV. Additionally, there are photos of others affected by the  disease, such as medical professionals and AIDS patients' parents, friends and  lovers.  </P> <P> "Our idea is to show that these are your sons, your daughters, your neighbors,"  McGrath said recently. "These are real people, living here. The exhibit is  anti-NIMBY (Not In My Back Yard), so we called it 'This Is Our Yard.' "  </P> <P> "We wanted to interrupt the hysteria and fear by allowing viewers to hear  peoples' stories," Hughes added, citing as indicative of the hysteria last  year's successful initiative in Irvine which deleted language from an existing  ordinance that extended anti-discrimination protections to homosexuals.  </P> <P> Twenty large color portraits make up the exhibit, which is showing at Irvine  Valley College Gallery Hall through Nov. 9. About half depict people with AIDS  or those infected with HIV. Accompanying each photo are responses by each  subject, in English and Spanish, to the question: "What do you want your  neighbors to know about your experience with AIDS?"  </P> <P> In some cases, the intimate, candid narratives are painfully tragic. Writes  Marge Goebbel after the illness took her son, Alan: "AIDS was the intruder into  our lives. Months of anger, fear, hate and love. I was the last one to give  up."  </P> <P> Ron Talamantez-Nevarez, a ruggedly handsome man photographed beside his  motorcycle, conveyed his uncertainty of living with HIV: "Will I get sick? Is  this a symptom? How much time do I have? What is death? Will anyone love me?"  </P> <P> But much of the writing reveals a positive outlook, courage and optimism, a  brightness like that in many of the portraits. In fact, the physical effects of  AIDS are apparent in only one photograph. Among the others are those of a  beautiful young woman sitting in the sun and a young man in his patio, smiling  broadly like a Cheshire Cat.  </P> <P> Where other photographers have taken a distinctly different approach,  portraying the disease's corporeal devastation, McGrath and Hughes said they  had something else in mind.  </P> <P> "In some ways, we wanted to interrupt those assumptions (about the deleterious  effects of AIDS) and show that there are people living with this disease," said  Hughes, who for the past three years has led a self-portrait photography  workshop in Laguna Beach for AIDS patients.  </P> <P> Wade Phillip Wenthur, for instance, is pictured smiling up from the sparkling  turquoise water of a swimming pool. He writes that this year his health has  never been better since he was found to have AIDS in 1986 at age 28.  </P> <P> "Because I have AIDS does not mean I think less of myself or should just sit at  home, anticipating death. I have found that AIDS is at the center of my life,  and I am enjoying myself, helping those around me that have been affected by  the HIV virus."  </P> <P> Writes John Rolling Thunder: "For myself there is no battle with the dis-ease  (sic), just total surrender to one of life's challenges. I am not dying from  this dis-ease either. I am living."  </P> <P> While some photographed for the exhibit have not been so fortunate, others who  had been very sick "are doing better now," McGrath added. "I think that's  important to know. A lot of people don't want to be seen as needing pity."  </P> <P> The upbeat element was one reason that the collaborators chose to shoot color  photographs: McGrath had seen many "scenes of the horrific" in black and white.  Color is also more realistic than the "abstract" alternative, he said, and  helps carry the message that those pictured are "your neighbors" in the Orange  County community, not feared casualties or mere numbers in a statistical study.  </P> <P> McGrath, 36, and Hughes, 35, met as undergraduates at Cal State Fullerton and  found their first participants through Laguna Shanti, the AIDS service  organization where Hughes conducts her workshop. Later, other local agencies  helped. The pair developed rewarding relationships and a certain intimacy with  those they photographed: One session with a bulky, large-format camera took  seven hours.  </P> <P> "It was an experience," said McGrath, who coordinates the photography program  at Irvine Valley College. "We got to spend quality time with people, and they  seemed to be really happy that they were being included in this and to have a  place to tell their stories."  </P> <P> "This Is Our Yard" is scheduled to be shown at the Art Store in Fullerton,  Cypress College, Pierce College and other sites in Orange, San Bernardino and  Los Angeles counties. The artists are also seeking donations to produce an  exhibit catalogue or book of their work.  </P> <P>  "This Is Our Yard," 20 large color photographic portraits of Orange County  residents who have AIDS or tested HIV positive and their family, friends,  lovers, care givers and AIDS service providers.

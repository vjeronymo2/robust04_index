			<p>CSO     [Editorial Report] The Odessa periodical  OFTALMOLOGICHESKIY ZHURNAL contains five articles on ophthalmic  pathologies caused by exposure to ionizing radiation released  during the Chernobyl accident. Studies of individuals who  either participated in post-accident clean-up or reside in the  contaminated zone indicate that they are at increased risk of a  variety of eye disorders, including cataracts.    Several of the reports indicate that radiation may be  initiating a variety of ophthalmic problems in children. In  52.1 percent of 6896 children who live in the Chernobyl  radiation contamination zone, researchers L. A. Sukhina, A. F.  Smirnova, S. V. Chubar and Ali Zorkot found ophthalmic disorders  such as refractive anomalies, chronic blepharoconjunctivitis,  pigmented neoplasms of the mucosa, opacification of the lens,  and edema of the optic nerve and retina. In many cases  pathologies were initially detected after radiation exposure and  may have been caused by it. The researchers found a much higher  incidence of pathologies than were detected in a 1985 study of  Ukrainian children, in which 6.1 percent had ophthalmic  disorders.    These findings about children are supported by animal  studies. Rats chronically exposed to increased levels of  ionizing radiation from the Chernobyl accident experienced  dystrophic, adaptive and proliferative changes in the retina,  concluded N. Ye. Dumbrova and N. I. Nesteruk. Young rats  brought into the contaminated zone suffered greater changes than  rats that had always lived in the zone. The cytoplasmic  structures of the photoreceptor were the earliest cells affected  and the most susceptible to damage. The researchers predict  that individuals exposed to radiation will experience slowly or  rapidly progressing dystrophic processes in the retina or  exacerbation of existing pathologies. Tn a study conducted on  newborn rats, N. N. Bushuyeva and N. Ye. Dumbrova found that  radiation of the thymus gland causes destructive changes in the  connective tissue of the sclera that may initiate the  development of myopia or promote its progression. The authors  propose long-term mass screening of children and adolescents in  high radiation zones.    Radiation from Chernobyl may also be causing premature aging  of the eyes. A study of senile cataracts in Tvano-Frankovsk  District has revealed a 35 percent increase during 1988-1993.  M. T. Shkromida, M. A. Mosyak, R.V. Boychuk, and T. N. Senyuk  found cataracts to be most frequent (9.1-9.8 per 10,000  population) in zones with the highest radioactivity levels. A  higher incidence was found in the Subcarpathian and Dniester  regions (8.3-9.5 patients per 10,000 population) than in the  Carpathian region (3.1-4.3 patients per 10,000). Cataracts  developed in younger individuals in the Dniester region than in  Carpathia.    Even low, legally permitted doses of ionizing radiation can  lead to senile cataracts and premature aging of the lens,  concluded B. Sh. Lazaretnik, Yu. V. Bakbardin and A. V.  Grebennik after a comparative study of Chernobyl clean-up  participants, contaminated zone residents, and control groups.  They also found that these ophthalmic changes can serve as an  indicator of overall accelerated senescence caused by radiation  exposure and manifested as chronic degeneration and inflammation  of the upper respiratory tract, and neurasthenia. This report  notes that other radiation-induced eye disorders identified in  previous studies of Chernobyl victims include vascular changes,  alterations in the ocular adnexa, and optic nerve pathologies.  These reports indicate that ophthalmic problems caused by  Chernobyl will be a growing problem for Ukraine. Most of the  articles propose additional research, as well as long-term  screening, prophylaxis and treatment of populations in zones  with increased radiation levels.</p>

			<p><P> January 19, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BREA;  </P> <P> CITY COUNCIL BACKS STREET REALIGNMENT  </P> <P> In a decision that angered several Brea residents, the City Council unanimously  supported a developers' proposal to realign Randolph Avenue near Brea  Marketplace.  </P> <P> Residents are upset because a proposed retail center on the former Brea-Olinda  High School site will require changes they say will create traffic problems on  the avenue.  </P> <P> Under the proposal, motorists driving south on Randolph will be prohibited from  turning left onto Birch Street. A concrete median will be built along Birch as  part of the overall plan for development in the area.  </P> <P> In addition to realigning Randolph, new traffic signals will be installed along  Birch at Poplar Avenue, one block west of Randolph, and at the entrance to the  planned shopping center.  </P> <P> Lowe Development Co. is expanding its Brea Marketplace at the Randolph Avenue  and Birch Street intersection. Initially, the firm proposed a  300,000-square-foot office building on the school site.  </P> <P> Officials say that residents living north of the development who want to make a  left turn on Birch Street will be able to do so at Poplar Avenue.  </P> <P> Residents say they fear there will be accidents caused by motorists who use  Poplar Avenue to get to the new signal. Poplar, they say, has more curves and  blind intersections than Randolph.  </P> <P> "It's less safe. It's unbelievable that they let this go through," resident Don  McBride said.  </P> <P> At Tuesday's meeting, six residents complained about the realignment.  </P> <P> "Traffic will be impacted in our residential area by the proposal," said Tim  Scott. "It would increase traffic in our neighborhood by 30%."  </P> <P> City Manager Frank Benest said installing a traffic light and a left-turn lane  at the Poplar and Birch intersection will ease traffic.  </P> <P> A decision on the realignment will affect about 300 homes.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Russian Federation President's edict "On Housing Credits" </F> preceded by ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA comment under general heading:  "We Shall Construct a House and Live There"]    [Text] For the absolute majority of Russian the housing  problem has always existed. In recent years the situation has  deteriorated markedly. The state is no longer able to afford  free housing for those on the waiting list. When it is a case  of the cost of the housing going on sale, people blench.    The so-called middle class has found itself in the worst  position. Those with special entitlements have hopes, albeit  slender ones, of obtaining free municipal housing. The middle  classes are now being asked to buy apartments. Here the bank  credit interest rates are such that they protect the banks  themselves against inflation.    The edicts of Russian Federation President B. Yeltsin signed  on the eve of Independence Day finally create the necessary  normative base for the legal activity of commercial structures  which have been engaging "illicitly" in the issue of bonds  guaranteeing that their owners will acquire housing in the  foreseeable future. Conditions are being created for investments  in the housing sphere and the foundation has also been laid for  the development of a system of targeted credits, including  mortgage loans. Finally, measures are being suggested for  reviving the construction of the apartment blocks and  residential regions "frozen" throughout the country.  <H5>  Russian Federation President's Edict no. 1180 on Housing </H5> Credits    With a view to rendering assistance to citizens in  constructing (reconstructing) and acquiring housing I decree:    1. That it be established that:    Russian Federation citizens who according to the updated  procedure have been deemed in need of improvement to their  housing conditions shall receive free subsidies for the  construction or acquisition of housing in accordance with the  Russian Federation Government's 10 December 1993 decree no. 1278  "On the Approval of the Statute on Granting Russian Federation  Citizens in Need of an Improvement to Their Housing Conditions  Free Subsidies for the Construction or Acquisition of Housing;"    Corporate bodies and citizens of the Russian Federation  shall  receive loans to construct (modernize) and acquire housing and  also to develop land plots for housing construction on a  commercial basis.    2. That the attached statute on housing credits be approved.    That it be established that the operation of the statute on  housing credits extends to credits obtained for the construction  and acquisition of real estate on garden and dacha plots.    3. That the organs of executive power of the Russian  Federation components activate work to provide or sell land  plots for housing construction to Russian Federation citizens  and corporate bodies involved in construction.    4. That the Russian Federation Government submit within  three months to the Federal Assembly State Duma a draft law on  altering the taxation of banks' profit obtained from granting  credits for the construction (modernization) and acquisition of  housing and for the development of land plots for housing  construction.    5. That it be recommended to enterprises and organizations  of various forms of ownership that within the procedure for  rendering assistance to their workers in improving housing  conditions they give banks guarantees that they will extinguish  the credits received by the enterprises' workers for the  construction (modernization) and acquisition of housing and for  the development of land plots for housing construction and  extinguish them in part or in full using their own funds.    6. This edict enters into force from the moment it is  signed.    [signed] Russian Federation President B. Yeltsin, Moscow,  Kremlin, 10 June 1994.</p>

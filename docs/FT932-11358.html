			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Japanese to stay in Cambodia despite killing MR Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's prime minister, is to hold a ministerial meeting today to review the intensifying conflict in Cambodia, where the ambush of a United Nations convoy yesterday led to the death of a Japanese police officer. But the prime minister, describing the attack as 'unpardonable', insisted that Japanese personnel would stay in Cambodia, although he demanded better protection for the 675 military and police officers taking part in the UN operation. Mr Haruyuki Takada, 33, was confirmed dead. Three other Japanese and at least five Dutch Marine commandos were wounded in the ambush, which a UN official in Phnom Penh blamed on Khmer Rouge guerrillas. The Khmer Rouge, which has refused to abide by a peace pact it and other warring factions signed in October 1991, has vowed to disrupt elections scheduled for May 23-28. They killed four Bulgarian peacekeepers in two attacks last month. Mr Yasushi Akashi, the UN chief in Cambodia, travelled to Beijing yesterday to meet Prince Norodom Sihanouk, Cambodian head of state, about the deteriorating security. The two are to attend a meeting tomorrow with representatives of Cambodia's four factions in the hope of ending the bloodshed. Mr Akashi, who is Japanese, is to discuss the attack with Prince Sihanouk. The prince yesterday appealed to the warring factions to work for peace. In Tokyo Mr Yohei Kono, the chief cabinet secretary, said Japan had an important international responsibility as part of the UN operation in Cambodia, but the government was under increasing opposition pressure to recall the personnel. 'This incident is clearly a challenge to the UN peacekeeping forces and we cannot allow it,' Mr Kono said. He and other Japanese leaders returned home early from their Golden Week holidays after learning of the attack. Japan's Social Democratic party, the largest opposition party, called for the immediate return of the personnel, arguing that the intensified Khmer Rouge guerrilla attacks mean that Cambodia no longer fits the guidelines for a Japanese peacekeeping operation. Under the guidelines, set after more than a year of public debate, Japanese personnel should not be despatched if a ceasefire agreement collapses. Most of the 600 Japanese military personnel are engaged in transport work, while 75 police officers assist with traffic control. The National Police Agency requested the UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia to 'take further measures to ensure the safety of our members'.</p>

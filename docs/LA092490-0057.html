			<p><P> September 24, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MIKE PENNER: RAMS GET SLIPPED A MICKEY  </P> <P> Cruelty to Mickey used to be a felony offense inside Anaheim city limits, but  that was back in the old days, back when a guy like John Robinson might want to  sip a few beers with a guy named Buddy.  </P> <P> Mickey Sutton had no buddies Sunday afternoon. Friendless, and often times  defenseless, Mickey was the man the Philadelphia Eagles picked on, and picked  on, and picked on, until there was nothing left to pick over.  </P> <P> It was Randall Cunningham over the top to Mike Quick for a quick six, Mickey  Sutton defending.  </P> <P> It was Randall Cunningham lobbing deep into the end zone for Calvin Williams,  Mickey Sutton defending.  </P> <P> It was Randall Cunningham to Fred Barnett for 33 yards to sustain the game's  final, and crushing drive, Mickey Sutton defending.  </P> <P> Poor Mickey. At 5 feet 8 and 172 pounds, he was the smallest player on the  field, giving away five inches and 23 pounds to Roger Ruzek, the Philadelphia  kicker. Every time Mickey looked up, he was looking up to an Eagle wide  receiver.  </P> <P> Mickey never asked to be here. He was happy in Buffalo, but the Bills cut him.  He had nothing to do with Jerry Gray's knee injury and the Rams' open house at  cornerback and the desperation that would drive a coach first to sign him and  then to start him against the most unpredictable and imaginative quarterback in  the league.  </P> <P> Mickey expected the worst. "I expect every pass to come my way," Mickey said.  He's been around. He knows that given an option, NFL quarterbacks will never  pick on anyone their own size.  </P> <P> Cunningham saw no need for a charitable contribution. The last time he played  the Rams, in a 1989 wild-card playoff game, he lost, 21-7, and had to suffer  seven months of Randall Can't Handle The Pressure headlines. Sunday, Cunningham  was looking for any edge he could find and in Sutton, he found a little one.  </P> <P> Cunningham dedicated the Eagles' first touchdown in a 27-21 victory over the  Rams to Mickey, a 15-yard pass to Quick.  </P> <P> "I told the coach that was the play I wanted to do," Cunningham said. "It's  called a '900' or something. It's just a streak. I'd watched all week in the  films how Mickey Sutton was playing and with the height difference between him  and Quick. . . .  </P> <P> "So, I just threw the ball up there."  </P> <P> Quick outleaped Mickey for the ball, just as Williams outleaped Mickey for  Philadelphia's second touchdown. Buddy Ryan, the Eagles' nothing-in-moderation  head coach, decided to pour it on. Mickey was a marked man and Ryan expressly  instructed Cunningham to keep throwing out mousetraps.  </P> <P> It was a 20-14 game when Cunningham one-hopped a pass to Williams near the Ram  goal line. A big incompletion -- until Sutton was flagged for illegal contact.  Cunningham got two more cracks at the end zone and with the second, running  back Robert Drummond squirmed off right tackle for a two-yard score. Eagles,  27-14, early in the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> Late in the fourth quarter, the Rams had pulled to within six points again and  were hoping for a last chance at the football when Cunningham dropped back from  his own 29-yard line on second and eight.  </P> <P> There was Sutton, trying to cover Barnett.  </P> <P> There was Barnett, straddling the sideline and Sutton, for a 33-yard reception  that would keep Philadelphia in possession of the football for the remainder of  the game.  </P> <P> Barnett was presented a game ball for making that catch.  </P> <P> "I thought he was out of bounds," Mickey said. "I thought he was a step out of  bounds."  </P> <P> But on this day, words spoke just as loudly as actions.  </P> <P> "They came to my side a lot," Mickey said. "They made some plays on me. But  it's not like I was always three yards behind the guy or was beaten badly. I  had the coverage. They just made the plays.  </P> <P> "Those guys get paid too."  </P> <P> Fritz Shurmur, Ram defensive coordinator, was quick to coordinate a defense for  Sutton.  </P> <P> "That happens," Shurmur said. "They always used a taller guy against Mickey. He  had reasonably good coverage all three times (the passes to Quick, Williams and  Barnett), but it simply became a physical thing.  </P> <P> "Mickey didn't do anything wrong. They were just a little taller and he was  just a little shorter."  </P> <P> He wasn't the only Ram to come up short, either. The Rams' incredible shrinking  pass rush gave Cunningham enough time to think about burning Sutton again, mull  over the philosophical implications, contemplate the unfairness of it all,  consider the meaning of life . . . and then say, "What the hell, let's beat the  little runt again."  </P> <P> On that topic, Mickey was as gracious as he could be.  </P> <P> "You definitely like to get a great pass rush going," he said, "but sometimes,  it's not there. (The Eagles) were able to mix it up pretty well. We had a lot  to think about.  </P> <P> "When they get the run going along with the pass, Randall's a tough guy to  stop."  </P> <P> It was a tale of mice and men, Sunday's game was. And as Mickey can tell you,  it's no fun being the mouse.  </P></p>

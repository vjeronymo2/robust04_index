			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Granada warned on breach of code Granada Television faces the prospect of a fine or an on-screen apology for repeated violations of Independent Television rules on 'undue prominence' of products in programmes. The programme complained of is This Morning, the two-hour live, weekday ITV programme which appears 32 weeks of the year. Sir George Russell, Independent Television Commission chairman, has informed Granada that the commission is 'minded to impose a statutory sanction' for the latest two breaches of the programme and sponsorship codes. The ITC can impose a fine of up to 3 per cent of Granada's qualifying revenue in the last financial year or Pounds 150m. The ITV company has been given a formal warning for an item transmitted on September 21 which featured Mr Victor Kiam discussing his Lady Remington range of jewellery. Viewers were invited to win pieces by devising an advertising slogan for the range. This, the ITC said yesterday, broke the rules which state that competition questions must not refer directly or indirectly to the products of the prize provider. Prizes should not be referred to editorially elsewhere in the programme. The product was also given undue prominence during the course of the programme. On October 12 groceries from the Safeway supermarket group were featured as competition prizes, the ITC says, again in breach of the rules. The ITC said yesterday it was concerned by the recurrence of code breaches on This Morning after six previous interventions during this year and last. The commission said yesterday: 'The ITC considers the failure to secure consistent compliance is unacceptable, particularly where advertiser or product references are involved.' Ms Andrea Wonfor, joint managing director of Granada Television, said last night that the complaints 'represent isolated lapses in editorial judgment but nevertheless we view breaches of the programme code extremely seriously'. Granada has now introduced new procedures.</p>

In the statement, Chairman Nakajima said: During the  latest Japan-U.S. summit talks which were held in a friendly  atmosphere, leaders of the two countries had a very sober  exchange of their views and we would like to highly rate that.  They affirmed the need for the two countries to maintain good  relations in the future despite their failure to bridge their  differences. We think their affirmation indicates that the  Japan-U.S. relations are about to enter a new mature stage.    Commenting on the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks,  Chairman Nakajima said: It is important for the two nations to  have a cooling-off period and the governments of the two  countries should discuss without haste ways to find areas of  agreement.    The Social Democratic Party of Japan issued a statement in  the name of Nobuyuki Sekiyama, chairman of the Policy Board. In  the statement, Chairman Sekiyama said: We regret that the  Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, which were high on the  agenda of the latest Japan-U.S. summit talks, failed to hammer  out an accord. Nonetheless, leaders of both Japan and the United  States agreed to build a new relationship between the two  countries under which the two countries frankly discuss what  they can do and cannot do on the basis of their unwavering  trust. We would like to highly rate that.</p>

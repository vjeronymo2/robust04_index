At the same time, the number of shootings involving Inglewood  police officers more than tripled, rising from three in 1988 to 11 in 1989.  </P> <P> In part, police attributed that increase to gangs and drugs. "We are  aggressively attacking gangs and drugs on our streets," Sgt. Harold Moret said.  "We are going to have police officer-criminal conflicts."  </P></p>

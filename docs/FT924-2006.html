			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / International Company News: Sanyo Securities to shut three foreign offices SANYO Securities, the second-tier Japanese broker, is to close three overseas offices. It will close subsidiaries in Paris and Melbourne and its representative office in Frankfurt at the end of this month. While all Japanese securities houses are under pressure to cut costs due to low volumes on the Tokyo stock market, profits at second-tier houses, which rely on retail bus-iness, have been hit severely. The announcement comes as all Japan's second-tier brokers are losing money, and when ties between smaller brokers and larger houses have been strained by problems at leading brokers. Sanyo said seven local employees in Paris, and two in Melbourne would lose their jobs. The closures will scale down Sanyo's overseas network to five subsidiaries and two representative offices.</p>

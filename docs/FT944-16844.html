			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / Lamont reopens Tory split on Europe: Hurd attacks ex-chancellor's suggestion that UK might have to consider quitting EU Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, last night reopened the deep divisions in the Conservative party over Europe with the stark suggestion that Britain might have to consider withdrawal from the European Union. His uncompromising rejection on the first day of the Tory conference of any further moves towards European integration was instantly dismissed by Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, as 'completely out of date'. But, with some on the Euro-sceptic wing of the party backing Mr Lamont's stance, his speech signalled the potential for the 1996 intergovernmental conference on the next stage of EU integration to spark a renewed Tory civil war. Mr Lamont accused Mr John Major of 'wishful thinking' in judging that Britain's partners would not press ahead with a single currency and dismissed as 'simplistic' the prime minister's assertion that leaving Europe was 'unthinkable'. There was not a 'shred of evidence' that any of the 11 other governments shared Britain's view of the EU's future. Earlier Mr Hurd had anticipated the intervention by warning the conference to ignore the Eurosceptics. 'There will always be siren sounds suggesting we can just turn our backs on the awfulness of Europe,' he said. Insisting that the federalist ambitions of Britain's partners had been severely curbed by the experience of the Maastricht Treaty, Mr Hurd said: ' We must resist that temptation. Our interest lies in steering Europe our way, rather than pretending we belong to another continent.' Amid criticism from the pro-European wing of the party, other cabinet ministers were less diplomatic. Privately they accused Mr Lamont of being driven by a desire to exact revenge on Mr Major for his dismissal from the Treasury. But Mr Lamont, whose Euro-sceptic credentials pre-date his departure from the government last year, articulated the views of a small but powerful minority within the party at Westminster. Some ministers - including in the cabinet Mr Michael Portillo, Mr Peter Lilley and Mr John Redwood - are understood to believe that Britain should not accept any further integration at the 1996 conference. Speaking at a fringe meeting organised by the rightwing Selsdon Group, Mr Lamont stressed he was not advocating immediate withdrawal from the EU. But he said: 'Britain is on a collision course with its partners unless we find a means of resolving the different aspirations.' He suggested that Britain should accept no further moves towards a federal Europe and opt for membership of the European Economic Area rather than the Union or an outer tier of EU membership.

			<p><P> November 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH-GORBACHEV SUMMIT IN MALTA  </P> <P> When Bush and Gorbachev meet they plan to have an unstructured agenda. Why not  structure it? Why go thousands of miles at tremendous cost just to put one's  feet up to talk? And for two days? Make it longer.  </P> <P> First of all, they should bury the Cold War in the deepest bowels of the  Mediterranean. Then the two leaders could make some preliminary proposals for  arms cuts. Throw fear into those death merchants, the arms manufacturers. Their  swan song is long overdue.  </P> <P> In the last three years Gorbachev has been more peace oriented than either  former President Reagan or Bush. Now is the time for the tentative Bush to do  something positive in the area of peace. If these things are done, the meeting  will be well worth it.  </P> <P> DON RADEMACHER, Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] 19 February, 1994. A Chinese Embassy spokesman  issued a press release on Li Teng-hui's so-called "holiday"  visit to Thailand. The press release reads:    Regarding the "holiday" visit to Thailand by Taiwan's Li  Teng-hui and his delegation, the Chinese side had repeatedly  explained its stand and made solemn representations to Thailand  in advance. The Chinese side had repeatedly pointed out that Li  Teng-hui, in the guise of holiday-making, had attempted to  develop "substantive relations" with Thailand, to create "two  Chinas" in the world, and to damage and disturb the existing  friendly relations between China and Thailand. China hoped that  Thailand would have taken into acount its overall interests in  the maintenance and development of the Sino-Thai relations and  cancel Li Teng-hui's visit to Thailand. We notice that although  His Excellency Prime Minister Chuan Likphai did not meet Li  Teng-hui, Li Teng-hui did visit Thailand and meet some Thai  leaders and senior government officials. Therefore it has  violated the commitment made by the Thai Government on the  Taiwan issue when China and Thailand established diplomatic  relations. This is deeply regrettable.</p>

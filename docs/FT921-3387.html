			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (The Budget and You): Looking beyond the horizon - The fund managers' view THE announcement of the election, and investors' views on some of the economic figures revealed in the Budget, have caused UK equity and gilt markets to fall this week. After 13 years of Conservative government, investors are nervous about the consequences of a change. But what will happen over the course of the election campaign, and the year ahead? To find out, Weekend FT writers asked fund managers for their views on the prospects for markets. Most managers are sanguine about share and bond prices, whatever the political shade of the next government. Dick Barfield, chief investment manager at Standard Life, thinks the gilt and equity markets will be volatile in the weeks up to the election and governed by swings in the polls. But he is optimistic over the longer term. 'In 12 months, there should not be too much difference in the level of the markets under either government.' Barfield thinks the level of inflation will have a greater effect on gilts and the stock market than the political complexion of the next government. 'Inflation is under good control and will come down further', he says. 'We see the equity market standing at around 2850 in a year's time and the yield on gilts about  1/2 or  3/4 of a percentage point lower than at the moment.' Simon Walters, investment director at Save &amp; Prosper, thinks the gilts market has already absorbed the bad news about the Pounds 28bn Public Sector Borrowing Requirement and knows that Labour will be constrained by the UK's entry into the Exchange Rate Mechanism. For these reasons, the outlook for gilts in a year's time should not be very different whichever government is in power. Their performance is likely to depend by the end of the year on forecasts for the 1993/94 PSBR which might be as high as Pounds 40bn. However, with inflation falling to about 3.5 per cent by this time next year, Walters sees the yield on 10 year government bonds in March 1993 at 8 1/4 per cent. The performance of equities, however, will be dependent on the outcome of the election. A hung parliament would mean uncertainty which would be bad for markets. And if Labour wins a working majority, the FT-SE 100 Index is likely to fall to about 2350 or 2400, Walters says. However, he sees a limit to the falls because the signs of economic recovery will be showing through. The index could stand at around 2850 or 2900 in a year, but those levels could be reached by September should the Conservatives be elected with a working majority, he thinks. Kenneth Levy, investment director at Capel-Cure Myers, said: 'You've got to look not so much at the election as at what preceded it. Base rate cuts are not so likely now, and the same applies for base rates outside this country. The budget was probably less than inspiring, so the short-term outlook must be pretty cautious.' Michael Lenhoff, portfolio strategist with CCM, said that the group has moved slightly further into cash, as a purely defensive measure for the election period. Longer term, Lenhoff makes clear that the group is optimistic: 'In the US the recovery is under way, and recovery in the UK is not that far down the road. We will see corporate profit growth come through regardless of which party wins.' Nils Taube, chairman of J Rothschild Investment Management, says: 'My feeling is that if the Labour party goes into a lead in the opinion polls and the market goes down, it could be a buying opportunity. The economy is on the turn.' Michael Hart, joint manager of the Foreign &amp; Colonial Investment Trust, believes that a year ahead, German interest rates should have come down a notch or so, and there are more signs of economic recovery in the US. Hart expects the market to do better under the Conservatives, although he sees the main damage from Labour resulting from the long term effect of its personal taxation plans. He sees 2700-2800 a possible target for the FT-SE 100 Index over the year, with gilts having a scope to be a little more cheerful than at present. While the eyes of the nation will be glued to the democratic circus over the next month, fund managers seem to have their eye on the long term.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Lt-Col G. Zhilin, Volga Military District, under </F> the rubric "The Problem Demands a Solution": "Troops of  Peacekeeping Forces Must Operate Decisively, Firmly and Without  Delay..."]    [Text] There has been a steady increase in the number of  armed conflicts on the territory of the CIS countries in recent  years. And there have been many causes. The main one, in my  opinion, lies in the inability of authorities to forestall a  developing outbreak of violence and particularly to extinguish  the flames of fratricidal war by political and economic means.    It is also apparent that local authorities are unable to  extricate themselves from such crises without external  assistance involving the use of force. This has been confirmed  by recent events in the Dniester Region and South Ossetia, where  peacekeeping forces have had their say.    The only peacekeeping division in Russia has been formed in  the Volga Military District. Some of its units and subunits are  already performing missions in hot spots. Although it should be  said for the sake of the truth that units and formations of the  Ground Troops, the VDV [Airborne Troops] and the MVD [Ministry  of Internal Affairs] have performed such functions and continue  to do so today.    A careful analysis of all the conflicts and their  localization by means of MS [peacekeeping forces] leads one to  believe that the peacekeeping forces are not very effective.  Soviet Army and MVD units separated the sides in the conflict in  Nagornyy Karabakh and on the border between Armenia and  Azerbaijan. They did not achieve the desired results, however.    Something similar is occurring right now. Units of the 201st  Motorized-Rifle Division were able to do practically nothing in  Tajikistan until they received reinforcements and authorization  to take decisive action. The situation in South Ossetia is  unstable.    There is an exception, to be sure: The positive experience  in  the Dniester Region. We succeeded in extinguishing the flames of  civil war there at the very height of the battle. It was not  peacekeeping forces, though. When these arrived from Russia, the  armed conflict had already been basically put down by units of  the 14th Guards Combined-Arms Army. It was the competent action  of the regular Russian Army which halted the carnage on the  streets of Bendery.    It is a well-known fact that the commander of the 14th Army  set up posts on the most dangerous sectors. The people called  them "Lebed barriers." It would be naive to assume that these  were weak posts with six soldiers and an armored personnel  carrier, however.    The fact is that Lieutenant-General A. Lebed, relying upon a  superb intelligence network which he had set up, inflicted such  damage upon attacking units of the opposing side with mobile  artillery groups it became clear to them that it was pointless  to continue the bloodshed. Surprise, precise, powerful,  preemptive strikes, as well as the availability of back-up  mobile armored groups, forced the initiators of the military  conflict to come to the negotiating table. And it can be boldly  stated today that, backed by the powerful 14th Guards  Combined-Arms Army, the peacekeeping forces have successfully  performed their functions for a year now. It would be difficult  to say how events would have developed had the Russian formation  not been in the area. Reports that Moldova is demanding the  withdrawal of units of the 14th Army from the Dniester Region  have recently appeared in the press. But let us imagine what  would become of the peacekeeping forces in that case. Obviously  the same thing which occurred with the UN subunits in Lebanon in  1962, when Israel committed aggression. Flouting international  law, its troops passed through the combat formations of the UN  forces swiftly and certainly. The same thing was done by units  of the Croatian Army this spring, when they pushed back the UN  battalions insolently and with impunity and launched offensive  operations against the Serbian Kraina.    We have our own bitter experience as well. Last summer, when  we were assigned the job of converting one of the district  formations into a peacekeeping formation, we recommended setting  up separate motorized-rifle battalions both on BTR-80s and BMPs  [infantry fighting vehicles], as well as separate mobile  artillery units (with intelligences assets) and subunits of army  aviation. In view of the fact that the peacekeeping forces would  be operating independently, we proposed including rear service  and technical support subunits.    However... a version involving a light, regiment-type  military unit was adopted. As a result we have a thin chain of  peacekeeping troops and patrols at hot spots. The commander of a  regiment (or battalion) is unable to set up a reserve of  long-range guns and mobile forces.    That sort of day-to-day service would seem adequate in a  peacetime situation, of course. But where is the guarantee that  we will not have a repeat of what occurred in Central Asia or in  the Caucasus? Seeing that the peacekeeping forces there were  incapable of providing a decisive rebuff, mobile armed groups  and bands began operating actively. And the flames of civil war  flared up with even greater force.    This is why I share Lieutenant-General A. Lebed's opinion:  "The main experience in preparing peacekeeping forces consists  in the following: If a decision is made to use troops, they must  be employed decisively, firmly and without delay. And it must be  clear to everyone that a force has arrived capable of putting  every insolent, encroaching bandit in his place. Anyone  attempting to throw a wrench into the works will be arrested or  destroyed." (VOYENNYY VESTNIK, No 1, 1993).    The composition of the forces and the organizational  structure of the units must provide for the bloodless  accomplishment of all the assigned missions. In other words, the  military strength of the peacekeeping forces and their  preparedness for decisive action must be such that the opposing  sides immediately lose their desire to continue the war.  Incidentally, the American command element understands this very  well. The experience of units and formations of U.S. forces in  the performance of peacekeeping actions is deserving of  attention. The Americans keep a close eye on the development of  every conflict. And if the government makes the decision, the  command element has adequate intelligence and rapidly prepares  and dispatches to the given area an adequate number of troops.    To the Americans an adequate number is an absolute  superiority over the enemy. Moreover, it is an absolute  superiority primarily in equipment and modern weapons. When a  large body of supermodern combat equipment, with a deafening  roar amplified many times over by special propaganda machines,  appears suddenly from the air, land or sea, the warring parties  automatically develop a desire to solve all the problems by  peaceful means. And should some field commander still open fire,  a devastating strike will be inflicted upon him from air and  land. The American troops are operating in this pattern in  Somalia.    This unquestionably requires a lot of personnel and assets.  It is justified, however. There is a large probability that the  fratricide can be halted without bloodshed. If we take this  route (and there is apparently no alternative), then, based on  our experience in the Dniester Region, we must first of all give  the peacekeeping forces political status. Then their units and  formations must be reinforced. In the CIS situation peacekeeping  forces with light weapons cannot separate the sides (this was  demonstrated by the events in Central Asia and in the Caucasus).  I repeat, the men in the blue helmets must have real power. Let  the soldiers man the posts and patrol with small arms in a jeep  or an armored personnel carrier, but they must be backed up by a  powerful striking force, as they say, of self-propelled,  long-range artillery groups and subunits of combat helicopters  and ground-attack aircraft. And, naturally, also by a mobile  reserve of tactical forces in tanks or infantry combat vehicles.    There should be special stress on intelligence. Peacekeeping  forces must be equipped with surface reconnaissance radar, night  vision devices and sets of reconnaissance and signaling devices.  These should make it possible to monitor areas and forestall an  attack by formation bands.    Units which perform special missions are manned and  outfitted  in this way. Take the expeditionary brigade of US Marines, for  example. Its members can carry out its assigned missions on  their own. Such a brigade includes a field landing group of  Marines, a composite air group and a brigade rear service group.  Such a tactical and operational formation has more than 50  tanks, over 120 guns and mortars, around 120 Tow and Dragon  ATGMs and other antitank weapons. It includes as many as 100 air  defense weapons, more than 100 infantry combat vehicles and  amphibious armored personnel carriers, around 200 combat planes  and helicopters.    A Marine expeditionary battalion includes a battalion  airborne group, a composite air squadron and a battalion  rear-service support group. Its arsenal includes as many as five  medium tanks, six 155mm howitzers, 40 antitank missile systems,  around 20 mortars, 20 Stinger air defense systems, almost 30  helicopters and 15 armored personnel carriers. These formations  are not intended for peacekeeping missions, of course. Their  structure could provide the basis for structuring and manning  Russian peacekeeping forces, however. It is the opinion of  specialists in the Volga Military District that a division of  peacekeeping forces should be a part of the Russian Army's  mobile forces; more specifically, of its rapid-reaction forces.  Such a formation could be employed in its entirety or in part in  the case of a full-scale war or limited (local) wars. If  necessary it could perform peacekeeping missions as well. Such a  formation should have a brigade composition, since this is the  optimal organization.    Let us say that it could include 12 separate motorized-rifle  battalions, of which four would be "heavy," that is, armed with  tanks and infantry fighting vehicles, while the rest would be on  BTR-80 wheeled armored personnel carriers. And certainly, three  or four support subunits. This would enable the command element  to execute missions with greater flexibility, to put together  and sent to a designated area the optimal grouping of personnel  and assets. You will agree that in one situation two light  battalions (on armored personnel carriers) with a support  battery and a flight of helicopters is sufficient, while another  would require five battalions, two of them "heavy" battalions, a  couple of separate, self-propelled artillery battalions for  overall fire support, and one or two squadrons of mixed  helicopters. They would be headed by brigade staffs and  supported by appropriate material and technical support groups.    And so, a formation should have four or five separate,  self-propelled artillery battalions, army air subunits and  separate units of all types of support forces.    Yes, this is reminiscent of a US mechanized division, but  the  purpose of the formation, which would ordinarily be employed not  at full strength but in part, necessitates the adoption of  precisely such a structure. In the case of peacekeeping  missions, the subunits in armored personnel carriers would  perform patrol service. Their authority, however, would be  backed up by intelligence subunits and helicopters of the army  aviation, a general support group and strike groups of "heavy"  battalions.    It is not possible in a single article to cover all of the  problems involved in the use of peacekeeping forces. Some people  will probably disagree with my suggestions for the employment  and the composition of peacekeeping units. So let us argue the  matter. After all, controversy brings out the truth.

Fedorov even spoke of an  "economic coup" and predicted that Russia would collapse. Yet,  German business people in Moscow, who are used to difficulties,  are not impressed by these gloomy forecasts. They are keeping  up their -- in many cases long-standing -- contacts with their  Russian partners.    The resignation of former Economics Minister Gaydar and  Finance Minister Fedorov, and the victory of right-wing  extremist "Liberal-Democrat" Vladimir Zhirinovskiy in the  parliamentary election are regarded by Andrea von Knoop,  representative of the German economy in Moscow, only as an  "additional risk factor in the overall Russian risk." No German  enterprise represented in Russia has reduced or even stopped its  activities as a result. On the contrary, her office has been  swamped by written requests from enterprises wanting to open an  office in Moscow. Many German business people welcome the  "certain predictability" offered by Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin and his deputy, Oleg Soskovets, and their "European  orientation," which contrasts with Gaydar's and Fedorov's  American orientation.    Last week, the activities of German business people in  Russia  intensified despite the crisis. Last Tuesday, for example, the  Viag-Bayernwerk-Gruppe gave a presentation in Moscow.  Carl-Wolfgang Sames, Viag adviser for Eastern Europe, said that  despite all difficulties, the group was trying to gain a  foothold in Russia, for example in the spheres of energy  management, the aluminum industry, the steel industry, and  transport logistics. Viag was planning to conclude agreements  with Russian regions worth at least 100 million German marks for  a period of about three years. Under the management of a German  consortium, metals, ores, and chemical products should then be  sold in the West and the revenues used for modernizing Russian  enterprises.    The Kloeckner concern is arranging the establishment of a  "German Compensation and Clearing Corporation" in the near  future to stimulate economic contacts between Germany, Russia,  and other CIS countries. The company Linde is planning to set  up offices in Moscow and several Russian regions in the near  future. Salamander AG just opened a new distribution office in  Moscow. It is designed to concentrate Salamander's activities,  which used to be divided up among various buildings in the  Moscow area, and make them more efficient. Salamander has had  business connections with the former Soviet Union since 1976,  and in 1987/88 established joint ventures in Leningrad and  Vitebsk.    After three years of negotiations, the Henkel group last  year  signed a contract on a 39 percent stake in the ERA AG, Tosno.  ERA manufactures washing powder and detergents and glues. It  is Henkel's second joint venture in Russia. The first has  existed since 1990 in Engels on the Volga. Only recently, the  AEG electric concern signed a deal for billions of marks that  will go beyond the year 2000 on the development and the  construction of three-phase train engines. As of 1998, some 200  engines should be built, mainly for use by the Russian state  railroads.    Siemens is so far represented on the Russian market with  eight joint ventures, including in the spheres of  telecommunications and the production of turbines. Moreover,  Siemens services medical and computer technology. Individually,  the Westdeutsche Landesbank (WestLB) has applied for a general  license to carry out banking transactions for foreign and  Russian legal persons. Should this license not be granted in  the foreseeable future -- President Yeltsin has suspended such  activities by foreign banks in Russia by decree until 1996 for  reasons of competition -- WestLB intends to confine itself to  foreign customers for its banking deals.</p>

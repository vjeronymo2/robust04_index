			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Nigeria maintains oil output as strike starts NIGERIA maintained oil production near its normal Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries quota of 1.8m barrels a day yesterday, the official start of the strike by the national oil workers' union, Nupeng. The strike is part of a move by the Nigerian Labour Congress to force the interim government to concede the outcome of the June presidential election. Although the oil workers' strike has left oil production intact it has reduced exploration activity and almost halted the marketing and distribution of fuel in the south-west of Nigeria, which accounts for 50 per cent of demand. The multinational oil producers have local agreements with the oil workers' unions that in case of a national strike they will maintain essential services, which include the production of crude oil. The oil majors report that their contingency plans have enabled them to maintain normal output. According to industry official, increased security at the oil fields from last week and the risk of workers'losing pay whilst on strike have also contributed to maintenance of production. Shell, which produces about half of Nigeria's production, continued to operate its Bonny terminal at the weekend, although the absence of experienced crew forced it to stop night loading. Onne port and Port Harcourt in the east and the two big ports in Lagos have been closed since Saturday and pilots are refusing to allow ships in or out. The downstream sector of the oil industry is more vulnerable to disruption and was already in poor condition before the strike began. The state-owned energy company, which has a monopoly on oil refining, importing and depots, has been unable to keep up an adequate supply of domestic refined products throughout Nigeria for several months. Reserves in Lagos and the south-west were already low by the weekend, when early strike action and confusion over the new grade of more expensive petrol had almost halted the supply. Deliveries of fuel have continued in the north and east of Nigeria. Nupeng is demanding the cancellation of the petrol price rise introduced through a new grade of petrol last week by President Ibrahim Babangida's outgoing regime. The new grade costs around ten times more than the ordinary grade and is the first step in the phasing out of Nigeria's domestic fuel price subsidy.</p>

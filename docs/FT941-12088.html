			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Europa merger thrown into confusion The proposed three-way merger between Europa Minerals, a small UK-quoted mining finance house, and two Australian groups with which it is already closely associated - Burmine and Austmin Gold - was thrown into further confusion yesterday when the Supreme Court of Western Australia granted an injunction preventing the formal offer being made until at least February 9, writes Kenneth Gooding. Mount Edon, another small Australian gold producer which has made a counter offer for Burmine, obtained the injunction by claiming that the proposed Pounds 15m offer by Burmine for Europa would be in breach of Australian Corporations Law and incapable of being implemented in its present form.</p>

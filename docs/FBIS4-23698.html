			<p>BFN     [Text] Trade and Industry Minister Trevor Manuel has said  in Cape Town that trade agreements between South Africa and its  neighbors will have to be renegotiated. Addressing a news  conference, Mr. Manuel said that this did not mean that existing  contractual agreements with neighboring countries like Botswana,  Lesotho, and Swaziland in the Customs Union will have to be  neglected. Existing structures like the Customs Union and the  Preferential Trade Agreement with Zimbabwe would not necessarily  be changed or phased out. Mr. Manuel said emphasis in this  exercise will be on consultation and on the harmonization of  existing and new trade links. Mr. Manuel said South Africa was  almost certain to join the Southern African Development  Community, SADC, during the organization's summit meeting in  August.</p>

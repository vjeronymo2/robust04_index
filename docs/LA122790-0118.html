			<p><P> December 27, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MUDSLIDE KNOCKS OUT WALLS, CEILINGS IN  HOUSE  </P> <P> A family escaped injury Wednesday morning when a mudslide swept down off a  hillside and caved in part of their house in Brentwood Estates, knocking out  walls and ceilings and covering the interior with oozing slime and debris.  </P> <P> Marla Cohn said she was lying in bed about 9:30 a.m. when she and her two young  children were startled by a deep rumbling noise that sounded like a major  earthquake, but with tree branches snapping and other noises.  </P> <P> "Then the hill behind us fell down and into our house, through the master  bathroom and into the bedroom," Cohn said. "It totally leveled the back rooms,"  including her bedroom.  </P> <P> "I thought Saddam Hussein had bombed the country," said Cohn's son Mason, 8,  who was in another room at the time.  </P> <P> John Cohn, a relative of the Cohns, said the slide apparently was triggered by  a buildup of leaking water from a broken pipe buried in the hill above the home  off Bundy Drive. He said half the one-story house was "wiped out."  </P> <P> The unattached garage of an adjacent home also was damaged.  </P> <P> Authorities said no one will know what caused the slide until geologic tests  are completed and the city Department of Water and Power and Building and  Safety officials investigate.  </P> <P> "It might have been a water main, but it might have been sprinklers left on,"  said Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman Greg Acevedo. "We've had that happen  before."  </P> <P> By evening, two bedrooms and two bathrooms in the Cohn home were piled to the  ceiling with parts of the house's walls, roof and support beams. The family was  forced to abandon the house temporarily for safety reasons.  </P> <P> Next door, Marone Cantwell and her husband spent the day and early evening  shoveling out their two mud-caked cars.  </P> <P> Although their house escaped damage, the back-yard pool was filled with mud and  the garage was irreparably damaged, Cantwell said, adding, "The whole hill came  down."

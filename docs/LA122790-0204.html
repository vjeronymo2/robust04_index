			<p><P> December 27, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> FLOW OF DRUG GRANTS DISPUTED  </P> <P> The federal government boasted today that it has sent states nearly $4.5  billion in anti-drug block grants since 1987 and claimed victory in unplugging  obstacles that have delayed the flow of money to states.  </P> <P> However, the U.S. Conference of Mayors was unimpressed with the report by the  Office of National Drug Control Policy, contending the money is not making its  way to local governments, which are bearing the violent brunt of the drug  crisis.  </P> <P> The report's preliminary estimates show that for fiscal year 1991, California  will reap the most from the three block grants -- $160.5 million and a 115%  increase over the amount it received in 1989. Wyoming will receive the least  amount among the 50 states, $4.7 million.  </P> <P> The grants are for law enforcement efforts, distributed by the Justice  Department; treatment, distributed by the Department of Health and Human  Services; and prevention, distributed by the Departments of Education and  Health and Human Services.  </P></p>

			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Zhirinovsky granted US visa The US yesterday granted a tourist visa to Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, Russia's nationalist leader, who is scheduled to give an address on the 'New Russia' next week in San Francisco. 'Our decision to issue Mr Zhirinovsky a visa neither endorses his views nor supports his ambitions,' a State Department spokesman said. 'The US government finds his views anathema.' Jewish groups have condemned the decision. State Department officials said the visa was for one entry only, whereas tourist visas are customarily for six months, and the Immigration and Naturalisation Service may decide to further limit how long Mr Zhirinovsky stays. Mr Zhirinovsky applied last month to visit the US for 14 days from this Friday. He has been invited to speak at the World Affairs Council in San Francisco next Monday on 'Creating a New Russia'. He is also hoping to visit Los Angeles, New York and Washington.</p>

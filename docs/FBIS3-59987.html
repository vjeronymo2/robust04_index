One of the accused tried to escape arrest by jumping from the  120 foot high Attock bridge and was killed. The other suspected  smuggler was arrested. According to reported details, Inspector  Shahzad was on duty with his Customs Special Squad at midnight  on Sunday and was checking cars near Kand when a military truck  drove up. The Customs officials signalled to the truck to stop,  but, instead of stopping, the driver accelerated and tried to  escape. Inspector Shahzad and his men pursued the truck and  stopped it near Attock bridge. While Customs agents were  searching the Air Force truck number 11037, the man sitting next  to the driver ran out of the truck and jumped into the river  from Attock bridge, but, instead of hitting water, he landed on  some rocks and was killed. Customs agents arrested the driver  and searched the truck. They found a large quantity of marijuana  in plastic sacks. The truck and driver were taken to Customs  House in Peshawar where the accused smuggler is being  interrogated. The [next] morning employees stationed at the  bridge informed the Akora Khattuck police that a body was found  under the bridge. The police delivered the body to Naushahra  hospital. Government identity cards and papers found on the dead  man showed that the man was an Air Force technician named Ghulam  Rasoul, son of Mohammad Hussain; he was from Faisal Abad and  worked at the Kamara Aeronautical Complex. Some 1,665 kilograms  of marijuana were recovered from the truck; the truck driver,  whose name is Mohammad Nawaz Mohammad, son of Mohammad Moqim,  and who lives at Chak Jalaluddin, Rawalpindi, is a senior  technician at Kamara Complex. The accused has been charged under  the Customs Act. In an interview with the MASHRIQ correspondent,  the accused, Mohammad Nawaz, said that earlier he had smuggled  textiles; that his task was to take the marijuana as far as  Kamara; his companion Ghulam Rasul was to take over from there  but he did not know what Rasul was going to do. The accused  denied any knowledge of the marijuana and said that the truck  was loaded at Chamkani and he was to take the load to Kamara.  Air Force personnel arrived to take the accused into custody.  Certain documents were recovered from the two suspects which  contain important revelations.</p>

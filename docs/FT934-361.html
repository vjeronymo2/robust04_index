			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / TUC wins more in court awards Unions affiliated to the Trades Union Congress may have won more than Pounds 300m in legal awards for members last year, the TUC says in its annual survey of union legal services today. The figure is higher than the 1991 level even though total union membership declined. Most of the 123,000 legal cases taken up by unions in 1992 concerned personal injury at work. Other issues included employment protection, criminal injury, road traffic accidents, copyright and libel. The figures do not include almost Pounds 20m won in compensation deducted by the government in return for welfare benefits under the 'clawback' rules; money gained through occupational benefit schemes, or cash won at tribunal hearings over wrongful dismissal, sex discrimination and state benefits. The survey covered 24 unions, representing almost three-quarters of union membership. Those unions won a total of Pounds 228m, suggesting a total for all unions of Pounds 310m.</p>

			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Tired of life THE BRITISH Tourist Authority no doubt expected its campaign to promote London as a friendly and affordable city to be greeted with scepticism. So accustomed have Londoners become to running their city down that they barely notice they are doing it. Mr William Davis, the BTA chairman, yesterday declared London to be a great capital, apparently forgetting his own annual report in which he trotted out the usual complaints about a litter-strewn, tired and tarnished city. It is this view of London which is tired and tarnished, but if the BTA cannot point that out, who can? Foreigners, perhaps. A poll published by Business Traveller magazine this week named London as the world's best city in which to do business. Earlier this summer, Le Monde's UK correspondent wrote approvingly of London's green spaces, gardens and village-like suburbs. Londoners tend to reward such praise with incredulity. Perhaps the BTA can find a way of turning Londoners' unique self-laceration into a tourist attraction.</p>

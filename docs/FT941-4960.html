			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Scottish exports up 30% in 1993 Exports of manufactured goods from Scotland rose by more than 30 per cent in value last year, says a new index of Scottish exports, James Buxton writes. The index, based on figures from 26 companies which account for 60 per cent of all Scottish exports, rose from its base of 100 in the first quarter to 130.1 for the fourth quarter, suggesting exports worth Pounds 10.9bn in the whole of 1993. Although all industrial sectors showed growth, the strongest export sector was computers. The index is compiled by Scottish Council Development and Industry, which lobbies for economic development.</p>

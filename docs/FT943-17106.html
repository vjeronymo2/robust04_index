			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / CBS close to merger with TV shopping network Mr Barry Diller, the US film industry executive who heads QVC Network, the cable television shopping group, would become chief executive of CBS, the television broadcasting network, under a merger plan being discussed by the two businesses. The companies said yesterday they were close to an agreement under which the much smaller QVC would be merged into CBS in a complex deal involving common and convertible stock, as well as a large cash pay-out to CBS stockholders. Mr Diller, who is regarded as one of the most talented Hollywood executives, would become chief executive of the combined group, as well as president and head of the board's executive committee. Mr Laurence Tisch, at present chairman and chief executive of CBS, would remain chairman of the group. The two sides expect their boards will approve an agreement in mid-July, but observers cautioned that the deal might flush out a hostile bid for CBS from a third party. Wall Street expressed its enthusiasm for the merger by sending CBS stock up Dollars 47 or 17.9 per cent to close at Dollars 310, giving it a market capitalisation of around Dollars 4.9bn. QVC rose Dollars 5 5/8 or 17.4 per cent to close at Dollars 38, capitalising it at around Dollars 1.6bn. Analysts said a link-up would be positive for both companies. Mr Diller, who built Fox Broadcasting into a fourth US television network before quitting to take over control of QVC, has been trying to build the home shopping company into a powerful media conglomerate. Last year he made an unsuccessful Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.5bn) bid for Paramount Communications, the film and publishing group. CBS, a troubled company when Mr Tisch took control in the mid-1980s, has become the most successful of the three big US broad casting networks, judged by their prime time audience ratings. But critics say it has not followed the lead of rivals ABC and NBC and diversified into cable television, which has gradually eroded the networks' share of US viewers. They also question the strength of its programming. Fox Broadcasting, part of Mr Rupert Murdoch's media empire, recently shocked the television industry by enticing away eight stations, owned by New World Communications, which had been previously affiliated to CBS. CBS, which earned Dollars 326m last year on revenues of Dollars 3.5bn, owns seven television stations and 21 radio stations in addition to its television network. QVC, which runs two cable television channels selling consumer goods ranging from jewellery to clothing, made Dollars 59m on revenues of Dollars 1.2bn in its last financial year.

			<p><P> November 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CASUALTIES IN PANAMA  </P> <P> Many still debate the true number of Panamanians who lost their lives in last  December's invasion. The exact answer is obvious and irrefutable: too many.  </P> <P> I went to Panama last February and visited a mass grave at the Jardin de Paz  cemetery where the bodies of hundreds of "liberated" Panamanians were tossed  into a pit and covered up. A woman mourning her husband told me he was buried  there somewhere, thrown into the pit "like a dog." Survivors could only guess  where their loved one lay beneath the 100 by 18 foot rectangle of bare earth.  </P> <P> The U.S. military and Panama's invasion-installed government admit to more than  500 killed, but many others say thousands more died. But the question goes  beyond statistics. The invasion's victims were people whose lives mattered.  They died in their own homes in an invasion carried out by a foreign power.  </P> <P> DANIEL JAMES KLOOSTER, Los Angeles  </P></p>

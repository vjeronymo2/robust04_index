			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Christopher pushes hard for Syrian peace Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, arrived in Israel from Syria yesterday as part of an intensive push by Washington to break the deadlock in peace talks between Jerusalem and Damascus amid growing pessimism on both sides. Israeli officials said the focus of Mr Christopher's seventh Middle East shuttle this year was to edge forward agreement on security arrangements that would be put in place following an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights. Israel and the US hope Mr Christopher will persuade Syria to send military experts to take part in a future round of negotiations between ambassadors in Washington. Gen John Shalikashvili, chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, is also in Israel and has held talks with Israeli military officials to discuss the deployment of US troops on the Golan following an Israeli-Syrian peace accord. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, has emphasised the importance of stationing US troops on the Heights, perhaps as the main component of a multinational force. He lobbied the US Congress to support such a move during his visit to Washington last month. Mr Rabin said earlier this week that huge gaps still separated the two sides, but he has increasingly been outlining the details of the security negotiations. On Monday he told the parliamentary defence committee there were three key security issues: preventing border incidents; mutual arrangements to prevent a surprise attack; and how to reduce the defence burden of the security package. In public, Syria continues to state its traditional line that Israel must first make a firm open commitment to full withdrawal from every inch of the Golan and has criticised Mr Rabin's proposal to hold an Israeli referendum on withdrawal from the Heights. Official Syrian newspapers attacked Israel yesterday, saying Israeli leaders 'rushed to put obstacles to stall the peace process'. Damascus has shown anger at Israel's demand for security arrangements to be more extensive on the Syrian side and insists on a policy of equality. But Israeli officials say in private Syrian negotiators are more willing to discuss security details and compromises with Mr Christopher. Both sides have been warning that time is running out for an agreement. Mr Walid al-Mu'allem, Syrian ambassador to Washington, said recently: 'The time which remains for achieving the agreement is months, not years.' He added that Syria would not be able to wait much longer and certainly not until the Middle East business conference in Amman set for June next year.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by reporter Kim Hyon-ik] </F>   [Text] In preparation for an all-out North Korean  provocation against the South, the Defense Ministry authorities  decided to complete the maintenance and supplementation of the  combined ROK-U.S. munitions support system for the U.S.  reinforcement forces by the end of July.    The Defense Ministry authorities intends to officially sign  with the United States in September an overall munitions support  agreement on the storage, support, and cost sharing for the 12  areas of major strategic materials, including ammunition and  communications, and to include it in writing in the Wartime Host  Nation's Support Agreement [WHNS] signed between the ROK and the  United States in 1991, after getting approval of the National  Assembly.    The WHNS stipulates military and civilian support for the  U.S. reinforcement forces to be deployed on the Korean peninsula  in case of emergency, and the U.S. side is stockpiling  up-to-date military equipment, including new-type ammunition, in  advance.    A senior government military official on 16 June said, "We  are checking and supplementing this plan in order to smoothly  supply military supplies, such as ammunition and weapons, in  case a war drags on."    The government official said that this comprehensive and  systematic munitions support plan will also comprise the plan to  enhance the capacity to mobilize the defense industry and the  organic cooperation between the ROK-U.S. Combined Forces and the  2d ROK Army which is not under the control of the Combined  Forces.</p>

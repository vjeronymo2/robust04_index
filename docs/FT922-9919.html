			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / Riots likely to provoke shift to right AS the smoke drifts away from a calmer Los Angeles, electoral analysts have been debating the likely political fallout from last week's riots and the controversial trial verdict that triggered them. Both President George Bush and Governor Bill Clinton have veered in their response to last week's events. They have gradually diminished their emphasis on understanding the frustration caused by a jury's acquittal of four police officers filmed beating Mr Rodney King, and have toughened their insistance on respect for law and order. In the longer run, however, both the verdict and the Los Angeles violence have unleashed emotions that could significantly reshape voting patterns, if either candidate can succeed in tapping them in November's presidential election. At first glance, Mr Bush would seem to have a hard task turning last week's events to his advantage. He has been accused both of fanning racial hatred with his divisive 1988 election campaign and of neglecting the urban problems that provided the tinder for the Los Angeles rioting. The latter criticism has been especially pointed when it has come from his own secretary of housing and urban development, Mr Jack Kemp. But for Mr Clinton, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, the issues raised in Los Angeles last week are also fraught with difficulty. Although he has drawn heavily on urban, low income and black voters in this year's primaries, Mr Clinton's candidacy has been underpinned by an effort to pull the Democratic party in a direction that will enable it to recapture the socially conservative middle class, and mostly white, voters who deserted it in the 1980s in favour of former president Ronald Reagan's Republicanism. Indeed, Mr Clinton has been criticised by many Democratic city leaders of himself neglecting urban problems in his campaigning  - although he has been consistent in his appeals for racial unity. Worse still, last week's scenes of burning and looting seem likely to reawaken the worst fears of white suburban voters and play into one of the most glaring of the Democrats' electoral weaknesses in the last two decades: the perception that they are soft on crime. There is one difference from the urban unrest of 1965-68 which propelled Mr Reagan to California's governorship and Mr Richard Nixon to the presidency on a law and order platform. This time, the Republicans have been in power, both in California and in the White House, for over a decade and so it should be more difficult for them to blame crime and violence on their Democratic opponents. Yet political analysts agree that the likely outcome of last week's violence  - despite general public disagreement with the acquittal that preceded it  -will be a move towards the right. This year, they argue, voters in the suburbs ' suburbs like Simi Valley, the predominantly white community whose jurors delivered last week's controversial verdict  - will for the first time outnumber those in the cities. For those voters, reaction to the rioting is likely to outweigh reaction to the verdict.</p>

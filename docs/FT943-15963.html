			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Clinton brings help and a warning to Baltics President Bill Clinton yesterday promised US support for new efforts to bring about the withdrawal of the last Russian troops from Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, but warned the citizens of the newly independent Baltic states that they must show greater tolerance to the ethnic Russian minorities in their populations. 'Never deny to others the justice and equality you fought so hard for and earned for yourselves. Freedom without tolerance is freedom unfulfilled,' Mr Clinton said in a speech to thousands of Latvians gathered in Riga's Freedom Square. Mr Clinton, who later flew to Poland, expressed confidence that Russia could resolve its disagreements with Estonia, the only country with which it has not agreed a troop withdrawal plan, if both sides showed flexibility. 'I think the differences are narrow,' he said. Russian troops have already pulled out of Lithuania and are due to quit Latvia by August 31. Negotiations with Estonia, however, are bedevilled by the status of ethnic Russians, including military pensioners. Although Mr Clinton insisted there was no link between the citizenship rights of Russians living in Estonia - an issue he discussed with President Boris Yeltsin by telephone before the Riga meeting - and the withdrawal of Russian troops, his strong call for tolerance was seen as a gesture to Mr Yeltsin's concerns. The status of the Russian minority is fiercely debated in all three Baltic countries, and is at the centre of heated discussion over a new citizenship law in Latvia. However, Estonia's President Lennart Meri recalled sharply that the Russian government itself had set the August 31 deadline. In an effort to smooth the way, Mr Clinton yesterday chipped in extra US money to resolve some of the outstanding issues. Besides promising Dollars 10m (Pounds 6.5m) for a three-nation Baltic peacekeeping battalion, he doubled the money available to help Latvia dismantle an unfinished early warning radar station at Skrunda. More than cash, however, Mr Clinton brought a symbolic promise of US support. 'The chain that binds our nations is unbreakable,' he told a cheering crowd. 'We will be partners so your nations will be forever free.' Lionel Barber adds from Brussels: The European Commission said yesterday it had completed negotiations for a free trade agreement with Estonia, paving the way for a free trade area for industrial goods with all three Baltic republics from next year. The deal, subject to council of ministers approval, involves the EU dismantling tariffs and quotas on goods by January 1. Estonia will remove its barriers by the same date, while Latvia and Lithuania will benefit from transition periods of four and six years respectively on sensitive products such as textiles. The other provisions of the agreements are modelled on pacts concluded with the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Romania.</p>

			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / International Company News: CRA makes Mt Kare sale offer CRA, the Australian mining company, has offered to sell its 51 per cent stake in the troubled Mount Kare alluvial gold mine in Papua New Guinea. Mr Mark Rayner, the CRA executive responsible for Papua New Guinea (PNG), confirmed yesterday that he had made the sale offer last week in discussions with Mr Masket Iangalio, PNG's mining and petroleum minister. Mr Rayner said CRA effectively had two conditions on any mine handover to PNG. One was that the sale would only be made to the rightful land owners and the other was that CRA retained secure exploration title to Mt Kare's hard rock mineral resource. CRA reportedly plans to offer participation in any hard rock exploration programme at Mt Kare to partners in the country's Porgera gold consortium. CRA's sale offer has come amid an intensified power struggle between more than 6,000 groups of competing land owners at Mt Kare. But reports of the offer in the Australian press on Monday brought a stinging response last night from Mr Paias Wingti, PNG prime minister. Mr Wingti accused 'vested interests' of starting a media campaign aimed at diverting his government from a review of 'iniquitous agreements' over the country's mineral resources. 'The activities of one or two of the major Australian-based interests here now in Papua New Guinea in seeking to divide or disadvantage our people over resource projects amount to a threat to our sovereignty,' Mr Wingti said. 'CRA and Placer should be comfortable in this country as long as they have a long-term commitment and are not here to rip profits out quickly and leave just as quickly,' he said.</p>

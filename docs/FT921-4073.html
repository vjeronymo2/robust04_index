			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / Citicorp settles in case on swaps THE FOURTH of six lead cases in the long-running litigation between banks and local authorities arising out of complex interest-rate swap agreements was settled out of court yesterday by Citicorp Investment Bank. The action by Citicorp Investment Bank, the UK arm of the US bank, against Sandwell Borough Council in West Midlands had been due to come to court on Monday. About 80 banks face losses of up to Pounds 600m following a House of Lords ruling last year that authorities were acting outside their powers in entering swap agreements, in which fixed interest-rate payments are exchanged for floating rate payments. The banks are trying to recover about a quarter of their losses by suing for restitution of funds paid to local authorities. With four of the six lead cases settled out of court, however, it may be necessary to name fresh lead cases. Banks could prove reluctant to be involved in fresh lead cases, as the process has proved expensive and time-consuming. One lawyer warned: 'It is quite possible that the process will reach stalemate.' Citicorp had claimed Pounds 521,323 against Sandwell which, in turn, was claiming Pounds 269,246 from the London Borough of Hackney. Hackney had a claim for interest against the London Borough of Brent. The terms of the settlement are confidential. The remaining lead cases - Chemical Bank and National Bank of North Carolina against Hammersmith and Fulham - are scheduled to be heard after Easter, but discussions about a settlement are believed to have begun. It is estimated that, of the 200 writs against local authorities (stayed when the lead cases were selected), about 50 cases have been settled privately. Others have been settled privately without writs being issued, and it is unclear how many fresh writs may have been issued by banks.</p>

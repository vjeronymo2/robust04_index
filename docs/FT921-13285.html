			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / US poised for tussle on economy: Taxes, spending and health care to dominate Congress session THE US Congress reconvenes today, with the House and Senate poised to plunge into debate on the US economy, the single most important issue in the 1992 election. Tax relief, economic growth packages, health care and the size of a 'peace dividend' from defence cuts will dominate the second session of the 102nd Congress. Legislative business will be put on hold, however, until after President George Bush's State of the Union address on January 28. The following day, the Bush administration will provide Congress with its fiscal 1993 budget (which begins in October). By unveiling these two policy pronouncements in succession, the White House hopes to gain early public support for its proposals ahead of the Democratic counter-attack. One intriguing tactical question is how far Mr Bush is ready to compromise with the Democratic majority in the House and Senate in order to ensure that some of his proposals - such as middle class tax relief, a cut in the capital gains tax, and help for first-time home buyers - pass into law. In his three years in office, Mr Bush has relied a great deal on his power of legislative veto to curb the Democratic majority. The exception was the 1990 budget deficit reduction agreement when he agreed reluctantly to a tax increase. Reaching agreement on the scope of middle class tax relief - a Democratic favourite in an election year - will require Mr Bush to compromise. The main issues this session are: Budget, taxes and spending: much will depend on the proposed cut in defence spending. Mr Bush is considering slashing Dollars 50bn over five years beyond current proposals; Democrats are looking at Dollars 100bn. The 1990 budget agreement seems certain to be modified, even if over all caps on total spending remain. Health care: Mr Bush may unveil proposals for tax credits for uninsured Americans, but sweeping legislation will have to wait until after the November election. Defence: The Pentagon wants to preserve personnel, so weapons systems such as the B-2 Stealth bomber and the Seawolf submarine will be either axed or drastically scaled back. Trade: debate on President Bush's trade mission to Japan will dominate early in the session. More important is whether Mr Bush will have a General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade deal to submit to Congress by the spring. Foreign aid: Congress must confront the sensitive issue of the Dollars 10bn housing loan guarantee request from Israel to help settle Soviet Jews; the Senate must consider ratification of the Start treaty with the former Soviet Union.</p>

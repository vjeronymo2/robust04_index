			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Reporter Wang Rantong (3769 3544 1749) and Correspondent </F> Niu Yaming (3662 0068 5407): "The Regional Organizational, Wage,  and Social Old-Age Pension Insurance System Reform Work  Conference Opens"]    [Excerpts] On the morning of 6 May, the regional party  committee and government cosponsored a work conference on  reforming the organizational, wage, and social old-age pension  insurance systems and implementing our region's plan for  organizational reform as approved by the party Central Committee  and the State Council. The conference also respectively made  overall arrangements for reforming "these three systems."    Wu Liji, deputy secretary of the regional party committee  and  chairman of the regional government, chaired the conference.    Bai Enpei, deputy secretary of the regional party committee,  made a speech at the conference.    Yun Bulong, vice chairman of the regional government,  relayed  Comrade Jiang Zemin's speech made at the national organizational  reform work conference and the CPC Central Committee and the  State Council's circular on the Inner Mongolia Autonomous  Region's plan for party and government organizational reform.  [passage omitted]    Bai Enpei stressed: To change the government functions, we  should make two key breakthroughs. First, according to the  principle of separating government functions from enterprise  management, we should realistically delegate to enterprises the  decision-making powers that belong to enterprises so that  enterprises will really become legal entities that are  independent for management, responsible for their own profits  and losses, and capable of developing and restricting themselves  as well as main bodies for market competition. The government  departments should mainly use economic and legal means and  necessary administrative means to regulate and control markets  and guide enterprises and will not interfere in enterprises'  production and management or manage enterprises' affairs.  Second, We should set up and perfect the macroeconomic  regulation and control system and use more laws, policies, and  economic levers to guide, regulate, and control markets so as to  promote a sound operation of the national economy. Whether or  not the government organs can smoothly change their functions  depends on the changes of ideas. Changing functions and  delegating powers to lower levels is essentially related to the  readjustment of rights and interests. Leaders of all  departments should have a common understanding about  organizational reform. According to the requirements for setting  up the socialist market economic system, we should proceed from  the overall economic situation, adopt resolute measures, and  ensure the changes of functions.    Bai Enpei stressed: The reasonable distribution of office  personnel is of vital importance to the organizational reform.  The party committees and governments at various levels should  overcome the feeling of fearing difficulties and be determined  to achieve the reform in this aspect. Office cadres are the  precious wealth of the party and the state, and talents are the  most valuable resources. Therefore, we should regard the  organizational reform as a favorable opportunity for developing  talents resources and emancipating productive forces. We should  not only pay attention to improving the office personnel  structure and the personnel quality but also try every means  possible to widen various channels to arrange these personnel.  [passage omitted]    Bai Enpei finally pointed out: After this conference, the  region will comprehensively carry out the "reform of the three  systems." The party committees and governments at various levels  should pay high attention to this, strengthen leadership,  carefully organize forces, and conscientiously implement the  reform plan. I believe that our region will certainly achieve  hoped for results in the "reform of the three systems" according  to the party Central Committee's requirements. [passage omitted]    Responsible persons of the Ministry of Personnel attended  the  conference.    Present at the conference were responsible persons of the  regional-level organs, departments, commissions, general  offices, bureaus, and mass organizations.    Also attending the conference were responsible persons of  various league and city party committees, administrative  offices, governments, and departments concerned.</p>

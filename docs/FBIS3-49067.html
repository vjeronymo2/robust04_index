At midday wounded  were still arriving at Sarajevo hospitals as the bombing  continued.    United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)  spokesman Ray Wilkinson said the number of humanitarian airdrops  over Bosnia would be increased over the next few days for  psychological reasons, with about 17 planes, mainly American,  taking part in the operation instead of eight. Regions which  had so far failed to receive any relief goods would be targeted  first, he added. [passage omitted]    Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic was due to meet with  Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic in Vienna Tuesday ahead  of upcoming peace negotiations in Geneva on the Bosnian conflict.    The latest deaths in Sarajevo come after 15 people died and  22 people were wounded during heavy shelling Monday in one of  the worst violence in weeks, according to UN Protection Force  (UNPROFOR) spokesman Idesbald van Biesebroeck.    On Tuesday at least six shells rained down on a building  between Marsal Tito Avenue, the main street of Sarajevo's old  town, and the Skenderija neighborhood where a large UNPROFOR  contingent from France has been deployed. The shells fell a few  hundred meters (yards) from Skenderija and the Bosnian  president's offices. Shelling was also reported from other  parts of the city.    Van Biesebroeck said UN military observers estimate the  Serbs  lobbed 203 shells on the capital Monday while predominantly  Moslem government troops fired 37. Serb forces have besieged  Sarajevo since April 1992. Van Biesebroek said artillery fire  was also reported from Gornji Vakuf and Busovaca, central Bosnia  Monday.    Bosnian Croat forces fired 20 mortars on east Mostar, the  Moslem-dominated main city of southern Herzegovina, but no toll  was immediately available. In eastern Bosnia, the situation was  calm Monday but Bosnian Serbs prevented a humanitarian aid  convoy from reaching the Moslem enclave of Gorazde, the  spokesman said. [passage omitted]    Greek European Affairs Minister Theodore Pangalos meanwhile  said it would be "absurd" to bomb targets in Bosnia-Herzegovina  as this would only "worsen the massacre in a bid to end the  atrocities." Greece, which took over the six-month rotating  presidency of the European Community on January 1, was  "absolutely opposed" to air strikes. "Not one but all  (belligerants) would have to be bombed, which would be a rather  absurd peace plan," Pangalos told Radio France International.  [passage omitted]</p>

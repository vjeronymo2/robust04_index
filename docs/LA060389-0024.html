			<p><P> June 3, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JESSICA AND THE DANGER OF UNLICENSED CHILD-CARE FACILITIES  </P> <P> The recent television dramatization of Jessica McClure's rescue from a well in  the yard of her child care provider overlooked a major point -- this  near-tragedy should never have occurred. Jessica, like hundreds of other  children in California and elsewhere, was injured at an unregulated, unlicensed  child-care facility.  </P> <P> Sometimes lost in such dramas is the fact that there are no national standards  to regulate child-care quality. As Congress continues to debate the merits of  child-care legislation, we cannot forget that while the availability and cost  of child care are pocketbook concerns for every parent, licensing and safety  standards are truly life-and-death issues.  </P> <P> Of the 52 child-care bills under consideration in Congress now, the Act for  Better Child Care (ABC) is the only one with adequate provisions. Too often,  pediatricians are called to treat children like Jessica only after their  accidents; frankly, we don't want the business.  </P> <P> DONALD W. SCHIFF MD  </P> <P> President  </P> <P> American Academy of Pediatrics  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The themes for Centers for Excellence should include identification, prevention and treatment, with a special focus on, but not limited to, neglect, cultural sensitivity, disability, and training about child abuse and neglect.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Proposed Demonstration and Service Priorities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Demonstration Models on Neglect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The intent of this priority is to fund service models for the prevention of neglect. These models should make provision for both the early identification of families at risk of neglect and the identification of chronically neglectful families, and neglected children (in placements or reunified) who may be in need of special services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Designing services for families that neglect children is a challenge. Both ecological and psychosocial factors influence the manifestation of neglect. The many differences and distinctions among neglectful families, including cultural distinctions, dictate a service model based on careful assessment of the family and services designed specifically for them.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The U.S. Advisory Board on Child Abuse and Neglect focuses on the ecological aspects. The Advisory Board's report,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Neighbors Helping Neighbors <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , (1993), recommends several strategies for strengthening neighborhoods and improving the quality of support available to families within their own communities, as a national strategy for the protection of children. Their recommendations include: involving residents as participants, planners and managers of neighborhood services; the encouragement of foster grandparent programs; empowerment through home ownership; the implementation of prevention zones by public/private partnerships; and the funding of more family resource centers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / Arts: Unidentified Human Remains and the True Nature of Love  -Theatre Love in the time of - no, not cholera, but AIDS, sex-killings, bulimia and answering machines. That is this play's theme, and the first thing to say is that, remarkably enough, it gives its audience a good time. It has the suspense of a thriller, some impressive interweaving of different dramaturgical devices, a ready store of ironic humour, and constant seriousness about love between friends. It is also, at the Hampstead Theatre, well performed in this, the Traverse Theatre production that was so successful in Edinburgh last year. I hardly care to add that, nonetheless, the play itself is not particularly good - and I will put off saying why. Unidentified Human Remains and the True Nature of Love, a 1990 play, is by 34-year-old Canadian playwright Brad Fraser. Set in Edmonton, Alberta, it pivots around two room-mates, David, an actor-cum-waiter, and Candy, a book critic. Though they once had an affair, he is gay and is cynical enough not to be looking for love. She, by contrast, thinks she is looking for it, whether from a handsome bartender or a devoted lesbian admirer. David's world includes hookers, drugs and rough sex. Meanwhile, out there in Edmonton, a rapist is killing women. It is easy for David to hear of these murders, but he prefers not to. We start to assume that the ripper is among the dramatis personae: which lends a definite whodunnit tension to proceedings. But what makes the play yet more absorbing is that it shows how dangerously touched by misogyny other male characters are too. You see it brewing up, for example, in Candy's bartender lover after she firsts rejects him; and later he hits her. Yet, though this makes her reject him again, she soon finds herself hitting her lesbian admirer. Fraser's play abounds in this kind of irony. Repeatedly, it shows the overlaps between normal and abnormal behaviour. David's pal Kane asks what he did last night. Drily, David replies, 'Got drunk, fucked some guy in a park, dressed up as a cowboy, and watched some guy beat up Benita.' Of course you laugh at this ludicrous account - the more because you know it to be true. And the irony is compounded by the ways we witnessed it - sometimes hearing him narrate it in the present tense. Elsewhere other characters, suddenly spotlit, voice his thoughts, as if becoming the complex echoes of his mind. Everything adds up to illustrate David's own dreadful escapism, dreadful not least because he refuses to admit that the one friend to whom he is most loyal, Bernie, may well be the ripper. Though the opening is too fancy, the play soon proceeds to hold its audience in a light, firm grasp. Ian Brown's staging perfectly realises the way in which Fraser shows us several 'scenes' at once, the way he interleaves first-person soliloquy, third-person narration and straight you-and-me scene-playing. Not all the Canadian accents are flawless - rare is the Brit who can say 'How now brown cow' like a true Canadian - but this never becomes a serious problem. All the performances, notably Dougray Scott's as David, are assured and convincing. So why do I say this is not a good play? Because the humour, though really funny, is sometimes too cute, too TV-comedy pat. Because the characters seem all to be 'types' from textbooks. Because whatever ought to make them individual, such as the fact that Candy is a book critic, is never fleshed out. Because Edmonton itself is never fleshed out. Because, as is obvious, such characters as Jerri (the lesbian) and Robert (the bartender) are merely plot devices. Because, for that matter, so is everyone else. It is to everyone's credit that these flaws never distract you as you watch. At the Hampstead Theatre, for a limited run</p>

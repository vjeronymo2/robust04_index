			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russian organisation seeks role in aluminium revolution The Vami Institute, the St Petersburg-based organisation that designed all the former Soviet Union's aluminium smelters, is making a determined attempt to play an important role in the coming revolution in the Russian aluminium industry. Several western aluminium companies are jockeying for positions in the Russian industry, which needs to replace or substantially refurbish its smelters. It seems possible that some western money will be available for this purpose following the recent trade agreement between the European Union and five big aluminium-producing countries which involved Russia agreeing to cut output. The Russian smelters are also expected to develop downstream fabricating activities so that Russia will consume more of the aluminium it produces. Vami, privatised in 1992, has appointed a new director, Mr Valery Lankin, and he has set his sights on establishing long-term arrangements with western groups. To this end, Vami is shortly to set up offices in New York and London. Mr Igor Platonov, Vami's foreign affairs director, said: 'All the CIS smelters were built to our designs and all western companies need to consult with us if they intend to do work at the smelters.' Vami had already been invited to take part in smelter refurbishment schemes by two US companies, Kaiser Aluminum and Reynolds Metals and been contacted by Pechiney of France. As the sole aluminium technical establishment in the former Soviet Union, Vami has some of the most up-to-date equipment in the world. Mr Platonov said it intends to offer some of its new technology to western companies - including that for composite materials, aluminium powders, very high purity aluminium, the production of alumina from very low quality bauxite and the production of magnesium from different sources. Vami now has just over 1,000 employees, down from 2,200 four years ago. Employees now own 31 per cent of the institute and the central government intends soon to sell its remaining 20 per cent by auction.</p>

			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Chancellor encourages 'business angels' - Measures will aim to boost investment and cut red tape burden Measures to help small business included a scheme to entice 'business angels', measures to encourage prompt payment of business bills and lighter audit requirements. The Enterprise Investment Scheme will replace the Business Expansion Scheme, which expires at the end of this year. The scheme will give up-front tax relief at 20 per cent on investments in the shares of unquoted trading companies, and income tax or capital gains tax relief on losses. Capital gains will be tax-free. Investors may put in up to Pounds 100,000 a year from 1994-95, and companies may raise up to Pounds 1m a year under the scheme. The Treasury said: 'By allowing investors to become paid directors, the scheme will encourage 'business angels' who want to contribute their expertise as well as their money.' Unlike the old BES, investments in private rented housing will be excluded. A new Venture Capital Trust scheme will give tax-free dividends and gains for pooled investments in unquoted trading companies. A consultation paper will be issued shortly. Capital gains tax reliefs will be extended so that an individual can defer tax on any gains reinvested in a qualifying unquoted trading company. Limits for the CGT retirement relief are being raised to give full relief on the first Pounds 250,000 of gains and 50 per cent relief on the next Pounds 750,000. The package included a number of measures to help business finances: Employers' national insurance contributions will be cut by 1 per cent for employees earning less than Pounds 200 a week; and 0.2 per cent for others. The Treasury said the savings for business would be greater than the cost of the changes to statutory sick pay (SSP), announced yesterday. For companies with a NIC bill below Pounds 20,000 a year SSP will be reimbursed in full after the first four weeks of each claim. 'This means that the cost of employment will fall, particularly for smaller firms, those which manage sickness absence well, and those with lower paid employees,' the Treasury said. The maximum real increase in business rates for businesses in transition to higher rate bills will be halved. This will save businesses Pounds 105m in 1994-95. The profit limit below which companies pay corporation tax at the small companies' rate of 25 per cent will be raised by Pounds 50,000 to Pounds 300,000. The limit above which companies pay tax at the main rate of 33 per cent rises to Pounds 1.5m. This will allow more companies to benefit from the small companies' relief. The Department of Trade and Industry published a consultative document on a range of options for government action 'to help to foster a culture of prompt payment'. It said its main options were legislation for statutory interest on late payment of debt and a new British Standard for prompt payment. All government contracts will in future contain a clause committing the client department to pay the contractor promptly, which will normally mean within 30 days. Main contractors on government contracts are required to treat their sub-contractors in the same way. They will no longer be able to include 'pay when paid' clauses in agreements with sub-contractors. The government also proposed a significant relaxation in the audit requirements for small companies. Company law currently requires all limited liability companies to have their accounts audited. This requirement will be abolished for companies with a turnover below Pounds 90,000 a year. Around 300,000 companies will benefit. For companies with a turnover between this figure and Pounds 350,000 a year, the audit will be replaced by a simple 'compilation report', certified by an accountant, confirming that the company's statutory accounts have been compiled from the company's records and are in accordance with the relevant statutory requirements. A further 200,000 companies will benefit from this change. The VAT registration threshold will be raised immediately from Pounds 37,600 to Pounds 45,000. This will allow up to 75,000 traders to opt out of VAT. The system for assessing personal tax will be simplified. This will help the self-employed in particular. These changes, announced in the March Budget, will be included in the Finance Bill. The government is looking at ways of cutting the costs to business of collecting national insurance contributions and income tax by aligning the definitions of earnings and expenses used in the two systems. The government is also considering a range of options for changing the way NICs are collected.</p>

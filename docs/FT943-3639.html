			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Soggy crisp prices and surfeit of pigs hold Dalgety to Pounds 120m Lower UK crisp prices and an over-abundance of continental pigs limited Dalgety, the food and agribusiness group, to a 7 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 120.1m for the year to June 30. Without these setbacks, operating profits from continuing operations would have risen about 10 per cent, Mr Richard Clothier, chief executive, said. They fell 4 per cent to Pounds 124.9m, although acquisitions contributed a further Pounds 9.6m to leave the group modestly ahead. With both markets expected to show tentative signs of recovery this year, however, Dalgety raised its final dividend from 12.65p to 13.15p a share. Dalgety said it would seek more acquisitions in continental Europe, where it was focusing on food ingredients and pet foods, while concentrating its consumer foods efforts on the UK where it has strong brands such as Golden Wonder Crisps. In line with that strategy, it said yesterday it was selling the Dutch savoury snack business to United Biscuits for Pounds 21m. The UK crisp market enjoyed volume growth over the past year but wholesale prices have fallen by at least 5 per cent, analysts estimate. Supermarkets have exploited excess capacity, persuading manufacturers to produce own-label snacks at low prices. Despite the pressures, Golden Wonder products increased their market share to 18 per cent. Further cost cuts was the key to improving profitability, Mr Clothier said. Operating profits from foods fell 13 per cent to Pounds 57.4m despite good performances from sauces and Spillers pet foods. The latter was boosted by the acquisition of Paragon from British Petroleum. Agribusiness operating profits rose 8 per cent to Pounds 34.8m. An animal feed acquisition and a 24 per cent increase in US sales by Dalgety's Pig Improvement Company offset low prices for its pigs in Europe. Food ingredients lifted operating profits by 49 per cent to Pounds 57.4m thanks to improved flour milling and acquisitions. Food distribution in the US reported a 15 per cent rise in operating profits to Pounds 16.4m, benefiting from higher sales to McDonald's and other customers. Group turnover rose 11 per cent from Pounds 4.47bn to Pounds 4.96bn. Pre-tax profit of Pounds 120. lm was struck after a Pounds 2.8m charge for the settlement of insurance claims. The 1992-93 figure of Pounds 112.2m included a Pounds 9m provision for the same reason. Including the charges, earnings per share were 36.7p against 35.7p. Acquisitions totalling Pounds 85m pushed up net debt to Pounds 127m from Pounds 49m and gearing from 12 to 33 per cent. Lex, Page 22 Dutch disposal, Page 27</p>

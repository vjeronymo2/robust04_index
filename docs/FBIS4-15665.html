			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 8 TASS -- "We are not able to boost  Russian troops withdrawal from Estonia. This problem should be  settled through negotiations," Estonian Ambassador Extraordinary  and Plenipotentiary Yuri Kahn told a news conference here today.    In his words, the Russian delegation to the bilateral  negotiations now wants to settle the withdrawal and military  pensioner problems in one treaty while the Estonian side favors  separate solution of these problems.    "Estonia and Russia are looking for solutions. The problem  of Russian troops withdrawal from Estonian territory remains the  most serious," said Kahn. "In our opinion, the troops withdrawal  treaty is ready for signing, but there are certain conditions  put by Russia that hamper the process".    "We understand the need for demarcation of the  Russian-Estonian border. Estonia has not laid any territorial  claims on Russia and it will hardly lay ones. The border line  issue should be settled in correspondence to international norms  of the Estonian-Russian treaty of 1920," stressed the ambassador.    In his opinion, the Russian side is determined to build and  equip the state border with Estonia.    Kahn hopes the upcoming meeting of the chairmen of the  Russian and Estonian parliament committees for international  affairs will help to find a way out from the complicated  situation.</p>

			<p>Still   Favors Conference on DPRK   <F P=102> PM1606090994 Moscow ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA in Russian First  Edition 16 Jun 94 p 6 </F>  <F P=103> PM1606090994 </F> <F P=104>  Moscow ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA </F> <F P=105>  Russian </F> BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Boris Filippov: "Dangerous Test of Strength. </F> Pyongyang Does Not Intend to Yield"]    [Text] The unresolved state of the crisis connected with  the verification of the DPRK's nuclear potential is making the  situation in the East Asian region more complex by the hour,  reviving gloomy recollections of the bloody Korean war into  which the United States, China, and the USSR were also drawn.  Discussions concerning the checking of nuclear installations in  North Korea are giving way to open threats about the use of  force, including military force.    The situation is dangerous because in the event of an armed  conflict, apart from the North and South Korean Armies, the  40,000-strong U.S. corps stationed in the south of the peninsula  will also be drawn into it.    North Korea has completed preparations for war on the Korean  peninsula, but as yet there are no particular signs in its steps  of readiness for armed provocations against Seoul. ROK Defense  Minister Yi Pyong-tae stated as much on Thursday, reading a  report in the military commission of the South Korean parliament.    From what he said, toward the end of July 1993 a special  staff was created in the DPRK to prepare for war, and weapons  and other military industry output were accumulated in  underground stores. Long-range self-propelled guns and rocket  launchers, presenting danger to the South Korean capital, were  placed in the foremost position near the DMZ dividing the  peninsula.    According to information from North Korean sources in  Moscow,  if there is an armed conflict, all eight nuclear electric power  stations on the territory of South Korea could be targets for  bombing strikes.    After that, so specialists believe, Chernobyl will look like  a light-hearted prelude to a real tragedy.    The Japanese SANKEI SHIMBUN, citing the manual circulated  among servicemen of the American contingent in South Korea, has  published figures about the correlation of forces on the Korean  peninsula. Becuase its forces are inferior to the U.S. and South  Korean forces opposing them in terms of technical equipment,  intelligence and tracking systems, and targeting and guidance  systems, the DPRK is trying to compensate for this with enhanced  maneuverability, training for action at night and in poor  visibility, and concentrating troops in the main salients, and  also by numerical superiority. In the event of an attack, the  DPRK will outnumber the combined American and South Korean  forces in manpower by six to one, in tanks and armored vehicles  by five to one, and in artillery by eight to one.    A possible attack, the newspaper believes, could be  organized  in three directions: Along the west and east coasts of the  peninsula, and also down the central valley. The most important  role, U.S. intelligence believes, will be played in this by the  60,000-strong DPRK special-purpose crack troops, whose mission  is to disrupt enemy rear services.    "If Japan heads or joins any sanctions against the DPRK we  will consider this a declaration of war, and Japan will not  escape proper retribution," a North Korean Foreign Ministry  statement transmitted by the KCNA agency says.    The worsening crisis is highlighting completely new problems  concerning North Korea's nuclear potential. As THE NEW YORK  TIMES believes, "North Korea could complete the process of  enriching the nuclear fuel recently removed from its nuclear  reactor in Yongbyon and obtain enough plutonium to make four or  five bombs by the end of this year."    At the same time THE WASHINGTON TIMES, citing well-informed  sources, writes that the operation to remove fuel from the  nuclear reactor in Yongbyon has caused "renewed" alarm in U.S.  intelligence departments. In this connection, concern is being  expressed that Pyongyang "could" pass on a nuclear device,  fissile materials, or technology to certain states in the Near  East. The potential buyers are being named as Iran, Iraq,  Libya, and Syria.    The powers with a profound interest in resolving the crisis  on the Korean Peninsula have not yet arrived at a unanimous  opinion on what action to take in the immediate future.    The United States has drawn up a draft UN Security Council  resolution providing for the imposition of an economic embargo  against Pyongyang but has not yet familiarized other countries  with its text. This was reported to THE NEW YORK TIMES by "U.S.  officials" at the UN headquarters.    According to South Korean President Kim Yong-sam, "the most  urgent task at present is for the UN Security Council to adopt a  resolution on the introduction of sanctions against North Korea."    Moscow, despite increasing appeals to the DPRK over the  suspicions that it is developing its own nuclear weapons, still  believes that this problem should be resolved within the  framework of the international conference proposed by Russia in  accordance with the "six plus two" formula. This was confirmed  in an interview with ITAR-TASS by Russian Federation Deputy  Foreign Minister Aleksandr Panov.    "Our position remains as before: We advocate a conference at  which this question must be resolved," the high-ranking Russian  diplomat said. "Since the dialogue failed at the bilateral  level, it must be resolved on a multilateral level."    This initiative has not yet met with support.    China is opposed to the use of sanctions against the DPRK, a  spokesman for the PRC Foreign Ministry declared Thursday,  reporting on the working talks between PRC Foreign Minister Qian  Qichen and ROK Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu on the nuclear  problem on the Korean Peninsula.    The speediest resumption of talks is the best way to resolve  the DPRK nuclear problem. The use of sanctions can only  exacerbate the problem and increase confrontation between the  sides involved, the PRC Foreign Ministry spokesman pointed out.    The likelihood of separate U.S., Japanese, and South Korean  sanctions against the DPRK is "extremely low" at present -- so  said a Japanese Foreign Ministry leadership spokesman at a Tokyo  meeting Wednesday with foreign policy experts from the Liberal  Democratic Party, the leading opposition party.    Tokyo does not believe, however, that there is any point in  the present situation in giving serious study to Russia's  proposals for holding an international conference on the Korean  Peninsula with the participation of the two Korean states,  China, Russia, the United States, Japan, the United Nations, and  the International Atomic Energy Agency. The ITAR-TASS Agency  was told this by a senior Japanese Foreign Ministry official.    He pointed out that Tokyo now intends to try to resolve the  problem of Pyongyang's nuclear program mainly on the basis of  close consultations with the United States and South Korea.</p>

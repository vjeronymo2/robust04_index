			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / International Company News: Dutch group raises forecast Internationale Nederlanden Group, the big Dutch financial services group, has raised its profit forecast for 1993 after reporting an 11 per cent increase in net profit for the first nine months of the year. The improvement was due mainly to continued profit growth in virtually all areas of banking, as well as to higher results in life insurance, particularly in the Netherlands and North America. The rise also reflects ING's withdrawal from the volatile and loss-making field of general re-insurance. Group net profit rose to Fl 1.39bn (Dollars 731m) in the first nine months of 1993 from Fl 1.25bn the year before. ING, which had previously forecast that profits would at least match the 1992 figure, is now predicting a 'moderate increase' in profits per share. The group's banking operations turned in a 17.7 per cent rise in pre-tax profit, outstripping the 6.2 per cent increase reported by ING's insurance arm. ING, created out of the 1991 merger between the Netherlands' biggest insurance company and its third-largest bank, is the leading Dutch proponent of 'bancassurance', the combining of insurance and banking services in one financial services group. ING's profits in banking rose virtually across the board, both at home and abroad, where ING Bank is a specialist in emerging markets banking. ING Bank's relatively new offices in eastern Europe have already started contributing to group profits, the company said.</p>

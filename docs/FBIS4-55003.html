			<p>BFN     [Text] Tuzla, Bosnia-Herzegovina, May 8 (AFP) -- Sixteen UN  military observers have deployed in the northeastern Bosnian  town of Brcko, the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) announced  Sunday [8 May], but Serbs forced another team in nearby Zvornik  to leave. A spokesman for UNPROFOR's northeastern sector,  Captain Jens Kirk, confirmed the deployment of 16 observers at  four observation posts near the front lines of the Bosnian  Serbs, who hold the town, in line with an agreement reached  earlier this week with local Serb authorities. Their presence  is aimed at averting fighting in a strategic corridor linking  Serbia with territory held by the Bosnian Serbs in Croatia and  northwestern Bosnia.    A UN official said the team in Zvornik, on the Drina River  border with Serbia, had been forced to leave Saturday by Serb  forces. Swedish General Gunnar Ridderstad, commander of  UNPROFOR forces in northeastern Bosnia, told AFP the withdrawal  threatened to disrupt observation of traffic through the town, a  key entry point into the Brcko corridor. He confirmed that  Bosnian Serb forces had been blocking the route from Tuzla to  the Moslem enclave of Srbrenica, a UN "safe area", since April  29.    "The situation is not desperate, as some convoys could still  come through from Belgrade, but it is getting worse every day,"  he said. He said the blockade followed Danish retaliation  against a Serb attack in which Danish tank gunners killed nine  Serbs and wounded four. According to unconfirmed reports from  both Serb and mainly Moslem Bosnian sources, the two sides have  been sending reinforcements to the corridor ahead of an expected  new, large-scale offensive.</p>

			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / Adverts attack Russian government over MMM The fate of the Russian finance company MMM hung in the balance yesterday as a group of people claiming to be simple shareholders took out full-page newspaper advertisements attacking the government for destabilising their company. Under the headline 'Why we trust MMM and don't trust the bureaucrats', the advertisement - which can be taken as a statement on behalf of MMM, even if routed through signatories - shows the same populist and ruthless sureness of touch displayed by Mr Sergei Mavrodi, MMM's president, in creating the huge financial group and promoting it through an unprecedented television campaign. It appeared as the finance ministry announced that it had invited Mr Mavrodi to a meeting today when he will be expected to divulge how many shareholders he has, show how he could pay such huge dividends on the shares, be told to conduct an audit of the company and explain why he has neither paid the taxes demanded of him nor produced documents long demanded by the ministry. Mr Andrei Vavilov, deputy finance minister, told Interfax news agency that the ministry remained 'loyal' to those companies dealing in shares  - but required them to obey the rules. The advertisement says that because of MMM hundreds of thousands of people have lifted themselves out of poverty and tens of thousands have amassed enough capital to go into business. Where the government merely talked about founding a middle class, MMM had done so. Noting that several senior government officials had called MMM a fraud and its leaders gangsters, the signatories say: 'Can (the state) criticise, or even bring administrative pressure to bear, not for what the company has done but for what, in its view, it might do?'</p>

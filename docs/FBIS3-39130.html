			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Olivier Provost: "Aerospatiale Receives Fr2 </F> Billion From State Instead of Fr3 Billion"]    [Text] Aerospatiale hoped to be recapitalized to the tune  of 3 billion French francs [Fr] by the French Government, its  majority shareholder (which holds 59.98 percent in conjunction  with the 20 percent owned by Credit Lyonnais and the 20-percent  share owned by state holding company Sogepa). The company will  only receive Fr2 billion. The company's two supervising  ministers, Defense Minister Francois Leotard and Economics  Minister Edmond Alphandery, announced this on 2 February. They  were backed by a lengthy official commentary: "This decision of  the state shareholder will allow Aerospatiale to benefit fully  from the progressive recovery of the markets especially in its  new programs such as the Airbus A330 and A340. Like most  aircraft manufacturers, it has been heavily affected by the  situation of airline companies and the reduction of military  sales. Aerospatiale knew how to adapt to this situation,  launching an austerity program in 1992 which it then reinforced  in 1993. Through this [funding] decision, the state shareholder  gives proof of its confidence in a company of great potential,  which has acquired in each of its product lines a leading global  market position."    The allocation of these funds confirms LA TRIBUNE's report  (see our edition on the 27 January 1994) of "an imminent but  partial recapitalization of Aerospatiale." The Fr2 billion  should increase shareholder equity to Fr8 billion on a little  more than Fr13 billion debt, or a ratio of 1.6 compared to the  somber ratio of three just a year ago. The company estimates  that its debt/equity ratio will be "presentable" in the future  and points out that it has "reduced its debt last year from Fr16  billion to some Fr13 billion and that it has reduced its  operating expenses 12 percent in the last two years." It notes  that it is engaged in heavy and strategic programs for the  future: the Aster missile, the Ariane 5 rocket, Tigre  helicopters, the NH90, and, of course, the new Airbus and ATR  aircraft.    The Economics Ministry -- the Defense Ministry argued for  funds of Fr3 billion -- noted that the recapitalization of  Aerospatiale, which is a "technological jewel, at the level of  U.S. companies, and with a strong commercial success," was "a  priority." The company, whose sales last year should turn out  to be Fr49.3 billion (- 5 percent) "has multiplied its sales by  five in 10 years. Aerospatiale -- political considerations  aside -- will only have been recapitalized twice, in 1988, for  around Fr2 billion, and today."    According to Bercy [Finance Ministry], the company, which  had  consolidated losses of Fr2.380 billion in 1992, "reported a very  notable recovery of its profits before the funding. These  funds, which will cover the 1994 reorganization plan, are  important but net profits will in any event register a sharp  increase. We are hoping that Aerospatiale will be able to break  even rapidly." The prospect of privatization is thus no longer  so far away.  <H5>  Budget for Public Company Funding Dwindles </H5>   The economics minister is a bit worried about the reactions  from Brussels over the funding of Aerospatiale. On the other  hand, the Fr21-billion budget for recapitalizing has dwindled  right in front one's eyes. A little more than Fr7 billion is  predicted for Bull (now being eyed by the EU Commission), at  least Fr5 billion for Air France, Fr2 billion for EMC (Potasses  d'Alsace), Fr500 million for CEPME; CGM, which is asking for  Fr5O0 million should also be helped. But then what of Giat  Industries, which wants Fr1 to Fr2 billion, which could be  withdrawn -- the negotiations are still going on -- from the  defense budget; of SNPE, which wants Fr400 million; and of  SNECMA, which already received Fr750 million in 1993, which  Bercy compares to Aerospatiale in terms of potential, and which  wants yet another Fr 1 billion?</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It is proposed to modify paragraph (d)(2) to require that methane tests be made at the face of each working place using extendable probes or other acceptable means. The existing standard requires that these tests be made at the last row of permanent roof support, unless tests are required to be made closer to the working face using extendable probes. The previous standard, like the proposal, required these tests to be made at the face. However, it should be noted that it was a common practice at one time for miners to set temporary support in order to proceed inby permanent support to make methane tests. Given the hazards associated with advancing inby permanent support for any reason, the Agency prohibited this practice in the mid 1980's. The use of probes would permit methane tests at the face while continuing the Agency's policy of prohibiting a person going inby the last permanent roof support to conduct a methane test. Comments received during informational meetings with the mining community stressed the need for methane tests to be conducted at the face during any mining operation. MSHA agrees that proper testing for methane at the face is essential for safe mining operations. Commenters questioned whether methane tests were being conducted adequately during deep cut operations. Some of the extended cuts currently being taken are up to 40 feet inby the last row of permanent roof supports. However, the Agency knows of no commercially available probe greater than 30 feet in length. In proposing the use of extendable probes or other acceptable means to test for methane during deep cut operations, MSHA realizes that the provision is technology forcing. By requiring methane tests at the face without having miners go inby the last row of permanent roof support, it is the intent of the Agency to achieve the maximum safety feasible. It is not the intent of the Agency to prohibit extended or deep cuts that are consistent with technologically feasible safe mining practices. In the interim, the Agency is soliciting comments on alternative compliance measures that could be acceptable in lieu of an extendable probe. The other changes proposed in paragraph (d)(2) clarify the location and frequency of the methane tests.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposal would transfer the existing recordkeeping and retention requirements under paragraphs (g) and (h) to &sect;75.363 Hazardous conditions, posting, correcting, and recording, and add a certification requirement under a new paragraph (g). The Agency received comments that without certification, no mechanism would exist to verify that examinations were conducted in belt conveyor entries. In response to these comments, proposed paragraph (g) would require, similar to a requirement of the previous standard, the on-shift examiner to certify by initials, date, and time that the belt conveyor entry was examined. The examiner would make this certification at a sufficient number of locations to indicate that the entire belt conveyor entry has been examined. This certification process is a common practice in the industry and is required by several state regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 75.363&blank;Hazardous Conditions; Posting, Correcting, and Recording <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 75.363 is a new provision included in the proposal in response to comments received by the Agency. The commenters stressed the importance of recording all hazardous conditions and questioned whether the existing standards require such a record in all cases. The Agency agrees that recording all hazardous conditions will result in a safety benefit by assuring notification of the mine foremen and certified persons who may be required to enter the areas to conduct the examinations. This would enable the examiner to double-check, during subsequent examinations, the areas where problems have occurred. The proposal would not require a record to be made for those shifts during which no hazardous conditions were found.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;75.363 is intended to apply to all hazardous conditions except for the recording of hazardous conditions discovered during preshift and weekly examinations governed by &sect;&sect;75.360 and 75.364, respectively and the action taken to correct these conditions. Section 75.363 would also apply to hazardous conditions found during the supplemental examination, examinations conducted by pumpers for themselves, and the on-shift examination, as well as any other hazardous condition. The proposal recognizes that the existing rule already requires the recording of hazardous conditions found during preshift and weekly examinations. Records completed in accordance with &sect;&sect;75.360 or 75.364 need not be duplicated in the &sect;75.363 records. The Agency believes that records of hazardous conditions discovered during these examinations would be more appropriately kept in the books maintained exclusively for those examination results and that no purpose would be served by duplicating those records.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (a) would require any area where a hazardous condition is found by or reported to the mine foreman, assistants to the mine foreman, or other certified persons designated by the operator to make examinations, to be posted against entry with a conspicuous danger sign. The danger sign would be placed at a location where anyone entering the area of the hazardous condition would pass so that persons approaching the area would be expected to see the danger sign. The posting of areas where hazardous conditions exist to alert persons is an accepted safety practice in the mining community. The area would remain posted until the hazardous conditions are corrected. As with the existing requirement in &sect;75.364, Weekly examination, paragraph (a) of the proposal would require that hazardous conditions be corrected immediately and that only persons designated by the operator to correct or evaluate the condition may enter a posted area. Additionally, if the hazardous condition creates an imminent danger, everyone must be withdrawn from the affected area to a safe area until the condition is corrected. Persons referred to in section 104(c) of the Act are permitted to remain in the area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

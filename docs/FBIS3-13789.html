Perhaps the most  salient form is the rabid U.S. political campaign which began to  escalate as the periodic UN Security Council review of the  blockade imposed on Iraq drew closer. All indications are that  the United States alone has continued to insist on this unjust  blockade.    The first and most important fact in this regard is that  Iraq  has implemented all its obligations vis-a-vis Resolution 687 on  the destruction of chemical, biological, nuclear weapons, and  missiles. Iraq has also agreed to abide by the substance of  Resolution 715 concerning future monitoring of weapon  manufacturing. This means that Iraq has not left any excuse for  the United States to continue the blockade.    The second fact is that the past months have witnessed many  serious developments in the international and regional stands  toward Iraq. There is a clear positive development in attitudes  of a number of UN Security Council permanent member  states--France, Russia, and China--on the issue of the blockade,  in addition to stands by other Council member states. This  change means among other things that the so-called international  consensus against Iraq, which the U.S. Administration continues  to arrogantly claim to exist, is neither existent nor possible  to realize, that only the Clinton administration, as we have  said, is insisting on continuing the embargo imposed on Iraq  despite the eroding justifications and causes of this embargo.    Moreover, this hostile and indiscriminate U.S. hostility to  Iraq is paralleled by an international awareness, which is  deepening and expanding every day, that Iraq carried out all the  measures and abided by all the obligations imposed on it by the  UN Security Council resolutions despite their injustice and  unfairness, and that it is time to deal objectively and fairly  with the blockade and implement Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687,  which clearly links the implementation of its provisions with  lifting the blockade on Iraq.    The question that springs to the mind is: What is behind  this immoral and inhuman U.S. attitude toward Iraq? Why does  the U.S. Administration indulge in its arrogance and its hostile  and unbridled policy against Iraq? What will the United States  reap from this war of starvation and poverty which it is  launching against Iraq?    In my humble opinion, the current U.S. foreign policy  represents the ugliest form of arrogance, tyranny, and brute  force. It may be said that the U.S. arrogance has reached its  peak these days despite the appearance of international evidence  and factors which indicate that the entire international  community, including states that are allied to the United  States, has started to take notice of this arrogance and its  dangers. These states have started to grumble and even to move  in one form or another against this high-handed and tyrannical  U.S. policy. Differences have cropped up between the United  States and its Western allies and Japan.    The Zionist lobby is tightening its grip on the Clinton  administration in a way unparalleled in previous  administrations. Reports from the United States speak of the  Zionist lobby's increasing influence on U.S. decisionmaking,  especially in foreign affairs. It seems that the Clinton  administration has definitively linked the preservation of U.S.  interests in Arab region with the preservation of Zionist  entity's strategic supremacy over the Arab nation. Can the  Zionist lobby forget that among the Arab countries only Iraq was  capable of undermining the foundations of the Zionist security  theory and to come close to realizing parity with "Israel?"    It can be argued that this hostile and conspiratorial  attitude toward Iraq--this wrong U.S. attitude against Iraq in  particular and against all states that differ with U.S. policy  and opinion in general--is due to the Clinton administration's  inability to understand the Iraqi question and the conditions  and policy of Iraq, as well as the conditions of the region in  general, and the administration's failure to understand the  political, social, and historical facts to enable it to take the  right stand toward Iraq. This U.S. political inability is due to  ignorance and inexperience, as well as the U.S. decisionmakers'  lack of coherence, clarity, and comprehensive understanding of  international political problems.    The United States realizes that its aggression against Iraq  has failed, that it did not succeed in realizing the basic  targets it had sought from this aggression. This feeling of  failure, impotency, and bitterness has prompted the United  States to continue its aggression and blockade on Iraq and to  continue its arrogance and feverish attempts to harm the Iraqi  people and encroach on their will and national dignity.    In light of all these facts and motives, it can be said that  the blockade imposed on our people and country for almost four  years will become--and it could already be--a U.S. blockade  which Iraq rejects ad strongly resist. No doubt, all the  fair-minded people and revolutionaries will take Iraq's side  against this U.S. blockade.</p>

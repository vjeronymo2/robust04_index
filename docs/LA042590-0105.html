			<p><P> April 25, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ARIZONA STATE INVADES COUNTY FOR OUTFIELDERS  </P> <P> Arizona State baseball Coach Jim Brock says every year he tries to recruit the  top four or five players in Southern California.  </P> <P> In 1988, Brock pursued and signed three of the Southland's top players, all  outfielders and all from Orange County.  </P> <P> Now, the three start for the third-ranked Sun Devils.  </P> <P> Jim Austin of Mater Dei High School is in left, Mike Kelly of Los Alamitos is  in center and Tommy Adams of Capistrano Valley is in right.  </P> <P> Until he bunted a ball off his nose and missed Friday's 8-4 victory over UCLA,  Austin was batting .354 with 13 home runs and 36 RBIs.  </P> <P> Austin, who was all-Southern Section, all-Orange County and the Angelus League  MVP in his senior season, began the season at third base but has since been  moved to the outfield, his natural position.  </P> <P> Kelly, hitting .356, is mentioned as a possible NCAA player of the year.  </P> <P> Adams, who still holds the Capistrano Valley record for batting average at  .471, is hitting .303 this season with nine home runs and 27 RBIs.  </P> <P> Last year, Brock landed another Orange County recruit, pitcher Tony Pena from  Mater Dei.  </P> <P> Pena has appeared in 19 games, all but one in relief, with a 1-1 record and a  3.45 earned-run average.

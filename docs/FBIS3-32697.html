			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Renata Verissimo] </F>   [Text] President Itamar Franco today sanctioned a law  creating the Brazilian Space Agency which will plan, coordinate,  and conduct Brazilian space activities through the national  policy for the development of space activities. The agency  reports directly to the presidency of the Republic. The  ceremony took place at President Itamar Franco's office and was  attended by the science and technology minister, the Air Force  minister, the industry and trade minister, the Armed Forces  chief of staff, and the president of the Chamber of Deputies.    Franco said the creation of the Brazilian Space Agency will  help to develop international cooperation and intensify private  sector participation in the field. He said:    [Begin recording] It is important to emphasize that from the  domestic viewpoint, the centralization of our space activities  will allow the private sector to participate more intensively.  It will ensure the participation of universities and other  educational institutions, promote research, and help develop  interest.    The establishment of this agency has international  repercussions and will allow Brazil to participate in the  exchange of services which are necessary for the economic and  technological development of the country. For this reason, the  creation of this agency is not merely an administrative act  because it will influence Brazilian relations with the  international community. [end recording]    The creation of the Brazilian Space Agency makes it possible  to install the first national launching facility in the country.  Currently, the large Brazilian satellites are launched from the  U.S. aerospace base.</p>

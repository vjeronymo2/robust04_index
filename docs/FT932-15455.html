			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / International Company News: IRI seeks to raise up to L1,200bn from SME IRI, the Italian state holding company, is expected to raise between L1,000bn and L1,200bn (Dollars 631m-Dollars 757m) by selling the industrial activities of its listed SME foods subsidiary. SME's food production activities are concentrated in Italgel (frozen foods) and Cirio, Bertolli, De Rica (canned foods and edible oils). Preliminary offers for the two businesses, put on sale in March, are due next week, after which final offers will be selected from a short list. The buyers may be known by the end of May. About 30 companies have expressed interest in the two businesses, including multinationals, domestic food groups and some financial interests. In spite of criticism of some conditions attached to the sales, a senior IRI executive stressed all the terms were negotiable apart from the need to maintain jobs and not alter workers' contracts. IRI executives say the disposals will go ahead on schedule, in spite of the lengthy occupation of SME's Naples headquarters by a small group of dissident workers. The sit-in has prevented access to the building, which houses computer information needed to draw up the group's 1992 results. 'The general climate in Naples is extremely delicate at present,' said an SME executive. 'It is not yet critical for us to remove them, and we do not want to create unnecessary tensions in the city.' Over the weekend it was revealed that secret negotiations had taken place between workers and management. However, the outcome is not yet clear. IRI has accelerated plans to sell other parts of SME, which also operates in food retailing and catering. Next month, it will sound out potential investors to take minority stakes in the two businesses, which will be kept together as one unit.</p>

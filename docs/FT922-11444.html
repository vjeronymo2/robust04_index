			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / World Stock Markets: Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce An editing error in yesterday's article on the Toronto stock market made it appear that Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce could not easily absorb a big write-down on its Olympia and York loans. In fact, the bank's chairman said on April 15 that the property developer's troubles will have only a limited impact on the bank's earnings. We apologise for the error.</p>

			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / France beats Britain and US to win Dollars 3.5bn UAE tank deal FRANCE HAS beaten the US and Britain in a bid to supply almost 400 battle tanks to the United Arab Emirates in a deal worth about Dollars 3.5bn.( Pounds 2.3bn) The new French Leclerc tank, made by the state-controlled GIAT Industries, was chosen in preference to the M1A2 Abrams, which General Dynamics of the US has sold to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Vickers of the UK also took part in the competition with its Challenger 2 tank, but was considered to be an outsider. The French emerged last year as clear favourite in what was seen as a two-way contest with the US. The UAE decision to give the order to the French was described as 'very, very bad news indeed' by Mr David Clark, the Labour party's defence spokesman. Mr Menzies Campbell, the Liberal Democrat defence spokesman, also said the decision was a big blow to Vickers and British manufacturing. However, the company said yesterday: 'It is not a blow at all -  you don't win every order you bid for.' It added: 'We are always looking for new business. We have been in business a long time and not being selected by one particular country is not going to have a significant effect on us at all.' Last month Vickers won its first export order for the Challenger 2 in a contract expected to involve about 40 tanks for Oman, worth around Pounds 150m. However, the UK producer still needs further orders to stave off the threat of closure of one of its two tank assembly lines in Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne. Vickers is fighting to secure an order from Saudi Arabia, which is considering a further purchase of 235 tanks in addition to the 465 M1A2s it is due to receive from General Dynamics. The UAE deal is the first export order for the Leclerc, an automatic-loading tank which in contrast to its western competitors requires a crew of three instead of four. The version sold to the UAE will be equipped with a German engine and transmission system, which have been specially cleared for export by the Bonn government. The arrangement marks a shift in German policy. Bonn has up to now banned German tank sales to the Middle East and in the 1980s decided to halt efforts to sell a hybrid German-British tank in the region. It emerged last year that Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahyan, ruler of Abu Dhabi and president of the UAE, had agreed to pay the estimated Dollars 50m cost of integrating the German engine after the French diesel was judged unsatisfactory. The engine, made by the Daimler-Benz offshoot MTU, is similar to the one in Germany's Leopard 2. Mr Pierre Joxe, French defence minister, said in Abu Dhabi yesterday that the deal was 'a tribute to French technology and to the position of France in the region'. The contract, announced shortly after the opening of a defence exhibition, involves 390 Leclerc tanks and 46 armoured repair and recovery vehicles, for delivery between 1994 and 1999. It is tied to an offset deal under which 60 per cent of the contract value is to be reinvested in the UAE. Such deals have become standard practice with defence contracts in the Gulf region. The deal confirms France's role as principal arms supplier to the UAE, in spite of a strong bid by the US to oust it from this position in the wake of the 1991 Gulf war. The bulk of the UAE's current tank fleet consists of French-supplied AMX-30s, and its air force is mainly made up of French aircraft including Mirage 2000 fighters.</p>

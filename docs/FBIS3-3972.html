On 7 March JIEFANGJUN BAO  published on page one a 1,200-character editorial entitled  "Tremendous Encouragement, Powerful Push," along with the  handwritten inscriptions of Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Liu Huaqing,  and Zhang Zhen, calling on people to learn from Xu Honggang.    The 23 February article entitled "What Should We Learn From  Heroes?" urged all Army personnel to emulate Xu Honggang's  loyalty to the party, the motherland, and the people. It also  called on them to emulate his outstanding political dedication  to the Army's and the state's modernization, his spirit of  carrying forward the party's and Army's fine traditions, serving  the people wholeheartedly, and sacrificing for all the people's  interests. It stated that all Army personnel should adopt his  moral concepts of constantly forging ahead, cherishing the Army  and mastering military skills, scrupulously performing his  duties well, earnestly practicing what he advocates, his strong  sense of responsibility, and his heroic spirit of having the  courage to do what is right and make sacrifices and dashing  forward to lend a helping hand when there are difficulties.    The 24 February article entitled "Set an Example of Lofty  Life" called on young people to learn from heroes, take the path  of maturity which heroes have charted, and strive to become  people who have lofty ideals, moral integrity, education, and a  sense of discipline. The article criticized some young people  who are influenced by money worship, hedonism, and egoism for  admiring and favoring "yuan millionaires [da kuan 1129 2949]"  and taking delight in talking about singers and film stars while  not having due interest in heroes.    The 25 February article entitled "Educate New People With  Fine Traditions" quoted Chairman Jiang Zemin as saying that Xu  Honggang's deeds embodied the Communist Party's tradition, the  old Red Army's tradition, the tradition of the Army cherishing  the people and the latter supporting the former, and the Chinese  nation's traditional virtue. To educate new people with fine  traditions, the commentator pointed out, it is necessary to know  and master the fine traditions, grasp their core and essence,  put them into practice, and pass them down, generation after  generation. The article urged party committees and political  offices of all troops to effectively carry out the work of  creating more socialist people like Xu Honggang.    The 26 February article entitled "Temper Oneself Into Steel"  encouraged all Army comrades to foster lofty ideals, a firm  conviction, and a correct outlook on life and value. It urged  Army comrades to temper themselves in their own jobs, in  military training, and in mastery of scientific theory, and to  strive to become qualified military personnel.    The 27 February article entitled "Let Us Sing the Song of  Unrighteousness" pointed out that the Army shoulders a heavy  responsibility in safeguarding national security and social  stability and that all comrades in the Army must have the  courage to do what is right, regardless of the consequences, in  wiping out various ugly social phenomena and evil forces and  safeguarding social stability.    On 7 March JIEFANGJUN BAO published an editorial, along with  handwritten inscriptions by Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Liu Huaqing,  and Chang Zhen on emulating Xu Honggang, calling the  inscriptions high praise for Comrade Xu Honggang, a tremendous  encouragement to officers and men of the whole Army, and a  powerful push in the vigorous drive to learn from Xu Honggang.  The editorial called on all Army comrades to conscientiously  respond to the call of the CPC Central Committee and the Central  Military Commission to emulate Xu Honggang with greater  enthusiasm, shape a glorious life with lofty ideals, strive to  be military personnel who have lofty ideals, moral integrity,  education, and a sense of discipline, make brilliant  achievements, and usher in the 21th century with a completely  new ideological outlook.</p>

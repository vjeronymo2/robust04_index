			<p>BFN     [Text] The MAINICHI SHIMBUN conducted a nationwide  telephone poll on 25 June, when Prime Minister Hata announced  that his cabinet would resign en masse, to ask 100 voters about  their choice for the next prime minister. The poll found that  60 percent of the voters said, "Hata should become prime  minister again," or "other politicians would be the same as  Hata." In the poll, the voters nominated 13 specific  candidates, with the exception of Hata, to be the next prime  minister, but the 13 candidates altogether were supported by  less than 10 percent of the voters. The poll revealed the fact  that the people were disenchanted with politics amid the  political turmoil. When asked in the poll about the next prime  minister, 44 voters, or nearly one-half of those polled, chose  Mr. Hata, while seven voters chose Masayoshi Takemura and seven  chose [Ichiro] Ozawa; 18 percent of the voters said, "I have no  position," or "I have no politician to nominate"; and former  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa was nominated by two voters to  be the next prime minister, while Yoshiro Mori of the Liberal  Democratic Party [LDP], former Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu,  Hajime Funada of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], and Hokkaido  Governor Takahiro Yokomichi were each nominated by one voter to  be the next prime minister. [figures as published]    Among the voters who chose Hata to be the next prime  minister, a company employee, age 27, from Aomori city, said:  "Hata was too short-lived. If no other politicians can do  better than Hata, then Hata should become prime minister again."  A housewife, age 37, from Fukui city, said, "Hata gives the  image of being an ordinary citizen." The seven voters who chose  Ozawa to be the next prime minister said, "Ozawa is now actually  managing politics, and we want him to carry out his activities  openly in the political arena."    An overwhelming number of the voters favored an alliance  between the LDP and the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ]  for the next coalition government, while 41 voters expressed  hope for the SDPJ's return to the government. Forty-five voters  expressed hope for the LDP's return to the government, saying,  "The LDP should participate in the coalition government, or the  LDP should forge an alliance with Shinseito." Meanwhile, some  voters stressed "the need to realign the established political  parties" and asserted that "the LDP and the SDPJ should both be  split up," or "what matters is not the alliance but the  substance of policies."    Asked in the poll what they expect of the next government,  46  voters cited economic stimulus measures, while 21 voters cited a  reform of the tax system, with 18 voters citing an improvement  in the social welfare system.    All the voters polled reacted coolly to the prime minister's  abrupt announcement that his cabinet will resign en masse. A  female voter who works for an organization in Fukushima  Prefecture said: "Japan is saddled with a host of domestic and  external issues, such as the yen's appreciation, deregulation,  and the [Naples G-7] summit. This is not the time for  politicians to engage in political strife."    Yachio Okura, a company employee from Mekuro ward in Tokyo,  demanded a dissolution of the House of Representatives, saying:  "The replacement of the prime minister alone is meaningless.  Even if the SDPJ returns to the coalition government, it would  not set out clear-cut policies. I am disgusted with the  political strife and the attempts to secure the required number  of parliamentary seats."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Harbin, January 7 (XINHUA) -- A Chinese leader has  urged officials at all levels to do more to help enterprises and  households overcome difficulties.    Li Ruihuan, a member of the Standing Committee of the  Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party Central  Committee, made the call during an inspection of northeast  China's Heilongjiang Province this week.    He stressed that government officials should help people  with  difficulties to enjoy the Spring Festival holiday, which falls  February 10.    The living standards of the Chinese people have been  markedly  improved thanks to rapid economic growth. However, some people  have not benefited as much as others from the economic  prosperity, he said.    He emphasized that the party is determined to make sure that  economic development is geared in such a way that nobody is left  out in the national drive for a better life.    Li, who also doubles as chairman of the National Committee  of  the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the  country's top political advisory body, said that the government  should consider the interests of the people in every aspect. He  pointed out that it should by all means guarantee the basic  living conditions of the broad masses, who have not so far  benefited from the reform measures.    He noted that while most people will benefit from the  reforms, not every individual is entitled to improvement at the  same time and to the same degree.    He urged Communist Party officials to attend to people's  needs and curtail official spending in order to appropriate  funds to aid people suffering hardships.</p>

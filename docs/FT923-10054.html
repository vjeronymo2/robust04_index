			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading IT WAS a listless trading session in the derivatives markets yesterday, with traders taking their cue from the foreign exchange sector rather than from any links with underlying equity prices. The September contract on the FT-SE Index struggled to hold on to its opening level of around 2,419 and, after briefly touching 2,425, went into a slow retreat. Local traders were largely out of the market and the Footsie futures contract moved on sentiment. The dip in sterling, although recovered before the close, heightened tensions over the outlook for interest rates in the wake of comments this week from the president of the Bundesbank. September closed at 2,414, 11 points down on the previous session and at a 4-point premium to its estimated fair value of 12. After the official close, the September contract came in for support, however, and later quotations of around 2,420 raised hopes for a firmer opening on Monday. In traded options, where total volume increased from 20,783 to 23,143, the FT-SE option saw 8,689 deals against just under 6,000 on Thursday. BAe topped the actives list.</p>

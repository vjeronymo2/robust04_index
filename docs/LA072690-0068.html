			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BACK TO BASICS: CRABS: GET 'EM WHILE THEY'RE SOFT  </P> <P> Blue crabs, found along the Atlantic Coast from Massachusetts to Florida and in  the Gulf of Mexico, shed their shells once each year. This is a natural part of  the shellfish's growth cycle and occurs between April and September.  </P> <P> The new shell begins to harden in four to five days, but crabs harvested just  after molting are almost entirely edible and considered a culinary delicacy.  Soft-shelled crabs are available fresh now through August, frozen the rest of  the year.  </P> <P> Blue crabs are one of the smaller varieties, weighing between 4 ounces and 16  ounces and averaging 5 inches to 7 inches across the back. During harvesting,  fishermen look for crabs with red-tipped claws -- an indication that the animal  will shed its shell within 48 hours.  </P> <P> Because of their small size, allow one crab as an appetizer serving, two to  three for an entree.  </P> <P> To prepare soft-shelled crabs for cooking, use kitchen scissors to cut a strip  from the front just behind the eyes (Step 1). This also removes the mouth and  antennae.  </P> <P> If a yellowish sand bag (the stomach) is present, remove and discard. Rinse the  crab well under cold running water and pat dry with paper towels.  </P> <P> Turn the crab on its back and remove the apron (triangular in females, T-shaped  in males) by prying it up with your fingers, then pulling down and away (Step  2). This will probably twist away easily, but if not, cut it away with  scissors. Discard along with the intestinal tract that is attached.  </P> <P> Turning the crab over again, lift the soft top shell at each pointed end.  Remove and discard the spongy gills (Step 3), then rinse the crab again with  cold water and pat dry.  </P> <P> The cleaned crabs are typically dredged in a mixture of flour and cornmeal,  seasoned to taste with salt and pepper. Then they are sauteed in equal parts of  butter and oil for about 10 minutes, turning once, until browned on both sides.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> GATHERS' FAMILY PLANS TO FILE SUIT;  </P> <P> LAWSUIT: ATTORNEY CLAIMS A LOYOLA OFFICIAL REQUESTED REDUCTION IN PLAYER'S  MEDICATION.  </P> <P> On the day that Dobbins Tech High School in Philadelphia held a memorial  service for Hank Gathers, an attorney for Gathers' family announced Friday he  plans to file a lawsuit in L.A. Superior Court against those he believes are  responsible for the former basketball star's death.  </P> <P> Gathers, 23, collapsed last Sunday during a West Coast Conference tournament  game in Gersten Pavilion. The Loyola Marymount star died 1 hour 40 minutes  later at Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital.  </P> <P> Among the most serious claims made by Bruce Fagel, a Beverly Hills attorney who  was previously a physician specializing in emergency medicine, was that someone  in the Loyola athletic department requested a reduction in Gathers' medication.  Fagel said that request, obtained in medical records, came "because it was  affecting his play."  </P> <P> Fagel said his staff is trying to determine who was involved in allowing  Gathers to play and whether proper medical standards were followed after  Gathers collapsed at midcourt. After that, the defendants will be named, he  said.  </P> <P> "Clearly the university wanted Mr. Gathers to play and they were involved,"  Fagel said. "I'm not sure if it was the coach or trainer. It is obvious at this  time the university is as much or more involved than the physicians in the  circumstances that led to Gathers' death. I want to find out who at the  university intervened in making decisions pertaining to medication dosages as  well as the decision to play."  </P> <P> In a statement issued by the university Friday night, Martin Burke, Loyola's  legal counsel, said the university was cooperating with Fagel's investigation.  </P> <P> "Loyola Marymount University has made available to Bruce Fagel . . . medical  records from the university health center," he said in the statement. "It is  our understanding that the physicians have cooperated with Mr. Fagel, and it is  the intent of the university to fully cooperate in the investigation.  </P> <P> "The threat of a lawsuit requires, however, that we consult with our insurance  carriers and their legal counsel. We will do this on Monday. The university is  convinced that Hank Gathers had outstanding physicians and that the  administration acted responsibly. He was only allowed to resume his athletic  activities following written release by his physicians."  </P> <P> Brian Quinn, Loyola Marymount's athletic director, said he had been advised by  Burke not to comment on the allegations made by Fagel.  </P> <P> Quinn acknowledged, however, that he was bothered by the fact that Fagel held  the news conference to make the charges before Gathers' funeral.  </P> <P> "I would say to you and anyone else that there was a beautiful marriage between  Hank and our university," he said Friday night. "I hate to see anything at this  point take away from the man, the grieving and hurt on our campus, the grieving  of his family. I'm going to the funeral to pay my last respects. After that, I  will have to sit down and figure out what's going on and why. At this stage, I  believe we did everything right and followed the best medical advice. I don't  know what else I can say."  </P> <P> Although Gathers' funeral is not scheduled until Monday in Philadelphia, Fagel  said he was compelled to announce the $1-million-plus suit after Loyola  president James N. Loughran said he was satisfied with the school's handling of  the matter.  </P> <P> Loughran told The Times on Thursday that a doctor's letter allowing Gathers to  play relieved the university of any responsibility.  </P> <P> The suit could encompass personal physicians, attending physicians and the  school. Fagel said the case will involve allegations of medical malpractice and  infliction of emotional distress on family members who witnessed the incident  Sunday.  </P> <P> California state law limits damage to $250,000 for malpractice claims of pain  and suffering against doctors.  </P> <P> Gathers fainted Dec. 9 during a game against UC Santa Barbara, and underwent a  number of tests that revealed he suffered from a heart condition.  </P> <P> He was prescribed the drug Inderal, a beta-blocker that can helps control  abnormal heart rhythms. Fagel said medical records show that Gathers reduced  his medication three times -- from 240 milligrams to 40 milligrams -- at the  recommendation of Dr. Vernon T. Hattori, a cardiologist affiliated with Daniel  Freeman Memorial Hospital in Inglewood.  </P> <P> Fagel also said family members and friends told him that Gathers took his  medication Saturday and Sunday.  </P> <P> Side effects of Inderal, according to the Physicians' Desk Reference, include  weakness, fatigue and lethargy with dosages of at least 160 milligrams per day.  </P> <P> Fagel said Gathers' medical records were made available by the doctors who  treated the player -- Hattori and Dr. Michael Mellman. While Fagel has received  some records from the university, he said school officials refused to release  other records on Gathers such as the doctor's clearance to allow Gathers to  play.  </P> <P> He said the Los Angeles County Coroner's office said preliminary tests show  Gathers' heart problem caused his death. The coroner's report is expected to be  released Wednesday or Thursday.  </P> <P> The suit also is expected to question the procedures of Gathers' immediate care  Sunday. Loyola officials had purchased a defibrillator on Hattori's advice when  Gathers returned to the Lions' lineup Dec. 30. It was taken on the road when  Loyola played in Philadelphia against LaSalle and St. John's.  </P> <P> The instrument, which can shock a failing heart back to a normal rhythm, was  not used after Gathers collapsed. Dr. Benjamin Schaeffer, an orthopedist from  the Kerlan-Jobe Clinic, and Dr. Daniel Hyslop, from Loyola's Student Health  Services, attended him.  </P></p>

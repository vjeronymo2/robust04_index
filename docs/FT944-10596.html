			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / Czechs set EU target dates The Czech Republic is to apply to join the European Union in 1996 and expects to be a member by 1999, Mr Vaclav Klaus, prime minister, said yesterday. Membership talks are expected to begin after the EU inter-governmental conference in 1996 which is to set the ground rules and timetable for membership for the countries of central and eastern Europe. Mr Klaus said the government would establish a special committee on January 1 to oversee the application. His announcement is expected to give the government a boost in the run-up to local elections being held on November 18 and 19. The Czech Republic will join Poland and Hungary as the first post-communist countries to be considered for membership. Hungary and Poland have already applied. Mr Klaus has long argued that his country is in a position to join now because of its advanced economic and political reforms. Slovakia, fourth member of the so-called Visegrad group, is also likely to seek entry.</p>

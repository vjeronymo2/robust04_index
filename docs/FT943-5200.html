			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Survey of Reinsurance (4): A faster profits centre - Bermuda's success raises hackles In July, Dr Hans-Jurgen Schinzler, chairman of Munich Re, the largest reinsurance company in the world, warned that it was already becoming difficult again for reinsurers to obtain reasonable conditions for catastrophe business. He told a German newspaper that it would not emulate some of its competitors in establishing a subsidiary in Bermuda to specialise in this area, and in an unusually forthright comment suggested that some of these, attracted by the high rates currently on offer wanted 'to make a quick dollar'. Such comments are familiar to the eight property catastrophe specialists based on the island. One local observer suggests wryly that Bermuda has suffered 'a slide into critical acclaim'. Mr Henry Keeling, chief underwriter for Mid Ocean Re, the first of the new specialist companies established in November 1992, believes any supposed conflict with 'traditionalists' is illusory. 'Reinsurance is a truly global business,' he says. 'Bermuda is simply the most efficient place to put our capital to work.' According to Mr John Dowling, chief executive of International Property Catastrophe Re, mainly owned by leading US insurers and reinsurers, the key issue is the success of the Bermuda market; the problem is that some observers measure success in a different way. The new companies are not a threat to the rest of the world market but a complement to it, Mr Dowling believes, drawing attention to the quality of both the capital and the personnel which they have recruited. They have also passed the acid test of securing a customer base among major - and very discriminating - property insurers, he says. Mr Michael Butt, chief executive of Mid Ocean, also identifies the 'flight to quality' as the key feature of the new market, which he suggests requires investors with a first class reputation, and capital of the order of Dollars 400m to Dollars 500m (Pounds 265m-335m). Bermuda's initial role was as the main centre for captive insurers owned by big commercial entities, a position which it still retains. The mid-1980s saw the establishment of the large, privately-owned high-level liability insurers ACE and XL and so-called financial or finite risk reinsurers which needed a tax-efficient location. There are now half a dozen of each, as well as two companies in formation aimed at coping with the US Oil Pollution Act. In a sense, therefore, the arrival of the catastrophe specialists marks Bermuda's coming of age, in providing capacity for part of the core business of the global reinsurance market rather than speciality requirements. The importance of this development is demonstrated by the updating of Bermuda's insurance legislation, an outline of which was expected to be announced last week. This is aimed primarily at removing any suggestion of insufficient supervision of companies active in international markets by introducing four categories of company, from simple captives to those writing commercial liability. After struggling for years to obtain some improvement from unwilling cedants, some European reinsurers might be forgiven for rather resenting any factor which might reduce the limited length of time for which they could enjoy better margins. Mr Dowling points out that while Bermuda may have raised Dollars 4.5bn in new capital, with perhaps another new Dollars 1.5bn in London, this still represents less than the Dollars 10bn which is often given as the amount withdrawn from the reinsurance market since 1987 - and there have been huge global losses from hurricane Andrew and the Northridge earthquake since the new companies were formed. Mr Keeling observes that 'there is still too much demand and not enough supply, especially in the US'. He points out that the new companies write a 'completely different' business mix than the so-called traditional reinsurer. By focusing closely upon property catastrophe business, stronger underwriting discipline can be exercised and aggregation and volatility controlled. By taking advantage of a low cost base and efficient use of capital, the maximum benefit of such wider margin business can be enjoyed. Mr Butt believes that the quality of the security offered will become 'ever more important' as client concern over uncollectable reinsurance increases. A variant of the 'margin reduction' criticism runs: unless catastrophes simply fail to occur, how can the above average returns promised to investors be generated except by writing other lines where margins are also temporarily attractive? In order to protect their asset base, the property catastrophe specialists must underwrite premium as a fraction of their capital (30 to 50 per cent is typical). Mr Dowling stresses that Dollars 4.5bn in capital for underwriting predominantly low frequency/high severity business does not mean the same volume of premium written as it would for a multi-line reinsurer. While it is true that most of the property catastrophe companies do write perhaps 40 per cent of their book in other property reinsurance, marine and aviation, Partner Re (the largest in terms of share capital), Tempest Re and Centre Cat are currently exclusively property catastrophe companies. More significant is the fact that none of the new companies write long-tail liability business. 'Our capital is transparent, unencumbered by such claims from the past,' Mr Dowling says. A third area of concern, hinted at by Dr Schinzler concerns the period and terms on which capital has been committed to the new ventures. One new facility which did not receive support from the capital markets was Compass Re, which was to have had a life span of about five years. The Compass Re vehicle will be finally wound up on September 23. If the non-insurance institutional backers of the new ventures are not long-term investors and are not to be rewarded by high current dividends, the implication is that they expect to make substantial gains through stock placements, as the initial investors in finite risk reinsurers were able to do. They will maximise their return if they can sell at the top of the market. Although most if not all of the new ventures emphasise that their return on capital is to be measured over a long period, and stress their long-term commitment, observers such as rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's have indicated reservations about whether the new facilities can prosper in a soft market as well as in a hard one. Mr Butt responds that the reputation of the investors is such is that they cannot afford simply to walk away. 'Over the next 10 years, reinsurers must offer their clients a greater degree of stability,' he says, adding that 'The concentration of capital into larger units with professional investors is necessary if that role is to be fulfilled.'</p>

			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / People: Heavyweights within its aegis Frank Law, septuagenarian former deputy chairman of NFC who took over as non-executive chairman of Aegis last September, has managed to persuade two respected figures from British industry and finance to join the board of the troubled media-buying agency that moved its headquarters to Paris last summer. The arrival of Sir Peter Thompson, ex-chairman of NFC and founder chairman of ProShare - which aims to encourage wider share ownership - plus Sir Kit McMahon, formerly deputy chairman of the Bank of England and chairman of Midland Bank, marks an attempt to restore the reputation of the once high-flying media stock, which, aside from its financial woes, has managed a poor record of corporate governance. Law points out that he was hitherto the only non-executive on the 10-man board - the other nine directors being all either executives of the company or representatives of the two major shareholders, one French and one American. 'It was sometimes a little lonely,' he remarks. Sir Peter (pictured right) he knows well. As a founder of the company that became NFC, Law says he played a part in his promotion to chief executive of what proved to be the government's most successful MBO. He met Sir Kit through Midland Bank. Rather than the board interviewing the candidates, Aegis' troubles meant that it was McMahon and Thompson who were given the opportunity to grill anyone they wished in the company, for however long - and on their own. Meanwhile, last summer's move to France unsettled UK institutions, not least because it removed Aegis from the jurisdiction of the Takeover Panel. Hence one crucial task for the new directors, who join in May, will be to help the company make up its mind how to address these institutional concerns. Given that Law is in his 78th year, there is also the question of who will be the next chairman. Analysts expect that Aegis, which reports on Tuesday, will unveil restructuring costs for 1992 that will more or less cancel out operating profits of some Pounds 50m. The share price, roughly 120p a year ago, collapsed over the summer, and dipped as low as 13p earlier this year. Yesterday it edged up 2p to 19p.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] People who have deserted their villages to take  refuge in the mountains and forests in order to avoid the  suppressive operations -- burning down villages, killing, and  bullying -- by the Vietnamese communist puppets, have said that  the two-headed government's troops in the Siem Reap and  Samraong-Oddar Meanchey zones -- under the command of Vietnamese  communist puppet military commanders; namely, Ke Kimyan, Pol  Saroeun, Long Sopheap, Prum Samen, and (Oy Sopheap) -- have  poisoned water sources, creeks, and ponds. People who used  water from these sources -- particularly children and old people  -- became intoxicated, vomited, and had convulsions. Some of  them died. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC banana plan 'grossly inefficient' says World Bank EUROPEAN COMMUNITY proposals to reform its banana import regime would generate immense monopoly profits for importers, wholesalers and retailers, and are grossly inefficient, a new World Bank working paper argues. The study says the plans are 'deliberately and unnecessarily complicated' to administer, and would give a large new bureaucracy 'tremendous power and control over the market', which is forecast to grow to 3.6m tonnes by 1993. The paper calculates that existing policies already cost EC consumers Dollars 1.6bn a year, with a direct cost to the community budget of Dollars 575m. The consumer cost could rise as high as Dollars 3.5bn depending on how the proposals are implemented, it says. Targeting the quota system's gross inefficiency, the paper calculates that even today for every dollar of aid generated for banana suppliers from African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries, EC consumers pay Dollars 5.30 - with about Dollars 3 of this going to importers, wholesalers and retailers as monopoly profit. The study has been circulated as members of the council of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, who meet in Geneva today, debate a fierce challenge to the EC reform proposals from Latin American banana exporters. Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Nicaragua and Venezuela want the community to scrap its complex plan, which would replace national banana import curbs with a community-wide quota and licence arrangement aimed at protecting traditional ACP suppliers under binding Lome Convention commitments. The competitive threat from Latin American 'dollar' bananas would be further limited by a 20 per cent tariff, with costlier bananas from ACP producers entering duty-free. The Latin Americans claim that the plan would cost them up to Dollars 500m (Pounds 292m) a year in export earnings and flouts Gatt rules against discrimination between trading partners. They say it runs counter to proposed farm trade reforms in the Uruguay Round of Gatt negotiations that would scrap all import quotas in favour of tariffs. The World Bank study provides a powerful endorsement for the Latin American case. It argues that there can be no objective basis for deciding the correct levels of quota, and that as such, quota-setting will become highly politicised, subject to intense lobbying by vested interests. It also details opportunities created by the quota and licence system for marketers to collude to maximise profits - even to the extent of destroying bananas once they have been imported under quota: 'There is no concrete proof that marketers would exploit their market powers created by quotas and licences (but) incentives will be created to encourage and partly condone such behaviour,' it says. As an alternative, the report calls for a 17.3 per cent self-financing tariff, which would fund direct deficiency payments to ACP banana producers, and would provide a more efficient, and more transparent means of protecting the banana producers' incomes. 'Excessive marketing margins of currently-protected marketers of both non-dollar and dollar fruit would be eliminated,' the study says: 'Currently-protected marketers would be the only losers of self-financing tariff operations.' The report points out that while at present the lion's share of the costs of the support for ACP producers comes from consumers in the UK, France, Spain, Portugal and Italy, the EC proposals would shift the costs to Germany, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland and Luxembourg. In Germany, the only community market currently open to free competition, consumers now pay about Dollars 1.50 a kilogram for bananas - which compares with about Dollars 2 in the UK, and almost Dollars 2.60 in Spain. It argues that unnamed 'vested interests' within the EC 'appear to be blocking the consideration, let alone adoption, of sensible policies'. Geest and Fyffes, leading importers of ACP bananas to the UK, would be among the significant beneficiaries if the present restrictive proposals by the commission were adopted. They have been lobbying hard in Brussels against a tariff-based reform, arguing that such reform would provide no defence for ACP suppliers against a concerted assault on the community market by US multinationals like Chiquita, Dole and Del Monte, which supply dollar bananas from Latin America.

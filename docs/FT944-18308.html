			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / International Company News: Axa confirms details of Boreal deal Axa, one of France's largest insurance groups, yesterday confirmed details of its purchase of Boreal Assurances, the Canadian non-life company, for FFr630m (Dollars 119.31m). Details of the price - which will be paid in cash - were released two months after Axa said it would make the acquisition from Suez, the French financial and industrial holding company. The purchase is likely to be completed within the next few days, pending regulatory approvals. Axa said Boreal, added to its existing Canadian subsidiary, would make it the fourth largest non-life insurance company in Canada, with annual turnover approaching CDollars 1bn (USDollars 700m). It controls The Equitable of the US. The group said it had no immediate plans for rationalisation and Boreal would continue to operate under its name alongside Axa Canada.</p>

			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / People: Banker turned housebuilder Richard Andrew, a former executive director of Scandinavian Bank in the UK, has been appointed chairman and chief executive of Wimpey's housebuilding division. He also becomes a director of George Wimpey, Britain's second largest housebuilder. It is unusual for a housebuilding company to appoint a chief executive from outside the construction industry, but as Joe Dwyer, Wimpey's group chief executive, explains: 'Richard Andrew will bring appropriate financial experience to an area where asset management is the key to profitability and success.' The decision to appoint a banker reflects Wimpey's view that Britain's entry into the EMS will change the way in which the UK housing market has traditionally operated and will make financial skills more important. Andrew, 47, was formerly director responsible for strategic planning and international business for the bank. In 1987 he was appointed chairman of The Private Capital Group, a personal financial services subsidiary.</p>

			<p><P> June 11, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FLAP OVER RED RIDING HOOD  </P> <P> In the past few weeks The Times has published an article (May 19) and several  letters (May 28) about the Culver City Unified School District's decision not  to include an illustrated version of Little Red Riding Hood in the first-grade  curriculum.  </P> <P> This decision was made after discussions with the district's K-12 language arts  committee, which consists of teachers and various administrators who met  throughout the year to select a new series of literary-based textbooks which  will be implemented in the 1990-91 school year.  </P> <P> After much review and the pilot use of several textbook editions in our  classrooms, the committee chose the Houghton-Mifflin series for Grades K-3.  This series comes with a set of supplemental paperback books.  </P> <P> An adaptation of Little Red Riding Hood, written and illustrated by Trina  Schart Hyman in 1983, was part of the supplemental package for first grade.  After reviewing this particular version of the fairy tale, it was decided not  to include it as part of the order because the message it gives conflicts with  the district's curriculum on drug and alcohol abuse. There are many references  to "grandma drinking wine to feel better" and an illustration which depicts the  grandmother with a red nose, holding up a full wine glass after consuming a  half of a bottle of wine.  </P> <P> From the first grade on, our youngsters are taught to say no to drugs and  alcohol. Alcohol and drug abuse prevention are part of the science and health  curriculum. The Culver City Police Department works closely with the district  with its Drug Abuse Resistance Education program and progress has been made  with students in this area. These are the reasons this version was not selected  for classroom use.  </P> <P> This is not a case of book banning or censorship. I assure you that there are  still many versions of Little Red Riding Hood in our school libraries and  classrooms. However, the fact remains that the district is currently involved  in a cause celebre because of this book and an explanation is important to  clarify our action.  </P> <P> CURT I.

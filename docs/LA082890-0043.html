			<p><P> August 28, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> REGIONAL ROUNDUP: UNIHEALTH MIGHT PURCHASE MORE PACIFICARE SHARES  </P> <P> UniHealth America, a Burbank-based nonprofit concern that owns hospitals and  other health care organizations, said it might purchase up to 500,000  additional shares of PacifiCare Health Systems Inc., a Cypress-based health  maintenance organization.  </P> <P> The purchase would raise UniHealth's stake in PacifiCare from 58% to 62% of the  total shares outstanding. However, that percentage could be affected by  PacifiCare's announcement last week that it might repurchase up to 500,000  shares of its common stock.  </P> <P> UniHealth said the stock purchase would be coordinated with PacifiCare's, and  would be made "when business conditions are favorable."  </P></p>

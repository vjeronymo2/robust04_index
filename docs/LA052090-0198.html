			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOOTLOOSE: WEAVING THROUGH SCOT ISLE  </P> <P> If you've ever had the desire to go crofting in the Outer Hebrides, the region  of Harris on the Isle of Lewis is just the place to have a go at  sheep-shearing, birthing lambs, hay-making or cutting and storing peat.  </P> <P> Hardscrabble farming has been a way of life for island crofters since anyone  can remember, so much so that many have taken to weaving the famous Harris  tweed or fishing as a second source of income.  </P> <P> Whatever the economic vagaries of life here, islanders remain in Harris for its  rolling landscape of spring wildflowers, summer blanket of mauve heather,  beautiful lochs and great beaches.  </P> <P> The air is alpine in its purity, crowds are unheard of and, even if you're out  in the boondocks, a mobile bank, butcher, baker and grocer call at your croft  regularly. There's also a play bus loaded with goodies to help keep the  children happy.  </P> <P> Getting here: Fly Northwest, British Airways, Air Canada or American to  Glasgow, then British Airways or Loganair to Stornoway on the Hebrides' Isle of  Lewis. From there it's an hour's drive down to Tarbert. The Los Angeles-Glasgow  leg will cost between $827 and $1,002 round trip, based on advance purchase,  month and day of week flown. Glasgow-Stornoway round trip is about $148.  </P> <P> How long/how much? You need at least three days here to begin to appreciate the  rugged beauty of the island and adjust to its leisurely pace. We found lodging  and dining costs very reasonable.  </P> <P> A few fast facts: The British pound recently sold for $1.64. Come here any time  from May through August, with May-June getting the least rain. Still, it rains  two out of three days on a yearly basis, so bring waterproof clothing and foot  gear for mucking about on the island.  </P> <P> Getting settled in: MacLeod Farm (Hillhead, Scadabay; $38 B&amp;B double,  shared bath) is one of the farms participating in Scotland's "Crofting Life  Holidays" program. It's about 10 minutes south of Tarbert on the east side of  the island, and has three bedrooms and two baths, with hot and cold water in  each room. An evening meal, which could be Scotch broth, lamb or cod, lots of  vegetables and dessert is about $9.  </P> <P> The Harris Hotel (Tarbert; $83 B&amp;B double, $73 without bath) is family  owned and a very typical country hotel with a good measure of charm. Bedrooms  differ in amenities -- some are modest, others have velvet draperies and  antiques.  </P> <P> Most rooms have views of Loch Tarbert or a small waterfall and kitchen garden.  A "residents' wee bar" off the lobby has the best selection of single-malt  Scotch whiskys in these parts, 50 by our count.  </P> <P> One of the few B&amp;Bs within town is Dunard House (main street; $41 B&amp;B  double, shared bath), a simple but comfortable place. There's hot-and-cold in  each room, self-catering coffee- and tea-making equipment, and only breakfast  is served.  </P> <P> Regional food and drink: Breakfasts are always hearty and generous affairs in  Scotland, and usually include a selection of juices, hot porridge (oatmeal),  eggs, bacon, ham, black pudding (don't ask about the offal ingredients),  oatcakes, toast, coffee and tea. It should hold you until lunch.  </P> <P> You'll find plenty of lamb and mutton on menus, perhaps venison in the fall,  but the island's tables come into their own with marvelous seafood. Try the  poached salmon, herring with oatmeal, delicious lemon sole, lobster, mussels or  broiled scallops.  </P> <P> Whiskey is spelled this way in Britain and it always means Scotch. Local lager  is the nearest thing to what Americans call beer, but it's much stronger.  </P> <P> Good local dining: The Harris Hotel sounds the gong before dinner (about 7:30),  and the dining room is a cheerful place with a gas fireplace and fresh flowers  on the tables. A four-course menu for about $20 may include smoked salmon,  trout or mussels; delightful turnip-and-almond soup or Scots haggis with neeps  (turnips); roast haunch of venison with red currant jelly or chicken Balmoral  (chicken breasts pan-fried with a sauce of whiskey, cream and mushrooms).  Dessert could be homemade shortcake or oatcakes with cheese.  </P> <P> Rosevilla Tearoom (main street) is a good spot for a crofter's lunch (about  $4), high tea or a plethora of pastries.  </P> <P> An Clachen Restaurant and Crafts Center (Leverburgh) is on the west side of the  island, above a grocery store and beside a crafts shop. It's a real  chips-with-everything place, simple and devoid of frills. The menu gives you a  wide choice of such items as fish and chips, chicken and chips, shrimp and  chips, sausage and chips and, no joke, pizza and chips. Or you can just have  the chips. The craft shop is interesting but terribly overpriced.  </P> <P> On your own: Crofting Life Holidays are offered by regional tourist boards on  the mainland of Scotland and in the Hebrides for periods of three, five or  seven days. You live in the croft house with the owners and can participate in  chores or local activities if you choose.  </P> <P> In addition to those mentioned above, you might also help sow crops, make  cheese, gather shellfish on beaches, fish for trout and lobster, make bread or  just relax with a little key bird watching.  </P> <P> A typical cost, for MacLeod Farm above, would be $88 per person for three  nights, $134 for five and $174 for the week, which includes lodging, breakfast  and the evening meal.  </P> <P> Harris Tweed has been woven here for more than four centuries, with very strict  rules governing its spinning, dying and weaving. Due to the tautness of the  loom and weight of the cloth, the weaving is usually done by men and always in  their own croft, then left by the house gate for pickup.  </P> <P> A five-minute boat ride takes you to the Isle of Scalpay, where a knitters  cooperative provides an outlet for sweaters, scarfs, socks and such, knitted by  ladies of the island from the Blackface sheep wool used in the tweed. A rich  and heavy hand-knit sweater should cost about $57.  </P> <P> If perchance you feel that your forebears may have sprung from the Outer  Hebrides, pop over to the Genealogy Research Service at Northton and let Bill  Lawson, its director, do a rundown on your Gaelic heritage. Lawson is all charm  and good cheer, and his old-schoolhouse home is a true oasis of fine books and  paintings.  </P> <P> For more information: Call the British Tourist Authority at (213) 628-3525, or  write (350 S. Figueroa St., Suite 450, Los Angeles 90071) for the Highlands and  Islands brochure, another on the Outer Hebrides, plus one on Scottish Farmhouse  Holidays.  </P> <P> For the Crofting Life Holidays booklet (giving locations and costs), write to  the Highlands and Islands Development Board, 20 Bridge St., Inverness IV1 1QR,  Scotland.  </P></p>

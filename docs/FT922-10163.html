			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Foreigners seek Royal Dutch MOST continental bourses were closed yesterday for the May Day holiday, writes Our Markets Staff. AMSTERDAM saw strong foreign interest in Royal Dutch while other blue chips were weaker. The CBS Tendency Index closed up 0.2 at 128.8 for a 0.15 per cent rise on the week. Royal Dutch advanced Fl 1.60 to Fl 154.50 but off the day's high of Fl 155.80 following a strong rise in US oil stocks overnight. Although the group released disappointing first quarter results from its US division during the day, some analysts said that sentiment remained positive on an upturn in demand during the second quarter. Heavy UK institutional buying was also noted in KLM and Daf, although both closed lower: KLM shed 30 cents to Fl 37.80 and Daf lost 10 cents to Fl 24. Akzo, ex dividend, remained in demand following Wednesday's good first quarter figures. It closed a net Fl 2.90 higher at Fl 158.90. COPENHAGEN was dominated by Hafnia which rose strongly after its board of directors said it would now support the rescue package proposed by a group of Danish shareholders dissatisfied with an offer from the Swedish insurer, Skandia. The all-share index rose 0.37 to 330.03, down 1.2 per cent on the week. Hafnia's B shares rose DKr30 to DKr250 on turnover of 35,000 shares while the thinly traded A shares jumped SKr42 to SKr325. Its rival, Baltica, in which Hafnia has a stake of more than 33 per cent, rose DKr15 to DKr635. Sophus Berendsen, whose UK Rentokil has been gaining ground, rose DKr40 to DKr1,900. ISTANBUL advanced on rumours of a fall in the monthly inflation rate, due to be announced on Monday. The index closed up 71.6 at 3,757.97, but was down 1.5 per cent on the week. Turnover was estimated at TL209.5bn. Among active shares, the cement group Adana A-type rose TL1,000 to TL11,500 on good first quarter results, Eczacibasi Yatirim, an investment company, gained TL500 to TL8,400 while its its pharmaceuticals division, Ilac, advanced TL750 to TL13,000.

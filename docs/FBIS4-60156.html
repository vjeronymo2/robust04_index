			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Second Friday sermon by President Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani </F> in Tehran on 20 May -- recorded]    [Excerpts] In the name of God, the merciful, the  compassionate. [passage omitted]    Another issue is the issue of hajj. Unfortunately, this year  with the immaturity shown by the Saudi regime, our society was  deprived of its holy objectives in this political and religious  rite of Islam [disavowal of infidels ceremony]. The Saudis  addressed the issue very badly. They could have solved the  problem much more sensibly and not caused differences between  the two important countries of the region. They could have  taken more of our pilgrims. The ceremonies could have taken  place in a way so as not to cause any problems for them. We had  informed them that we did not wish to disturb anyone and that we  intended to hold religious ceremonies. However, we have to wait  to see under what conditions they took this immature step, we  have to wait to understand its roots.    Of course, today Islamic unity and the unity of Muslims is  very important for us as a principle alongside the principle of  disavowal. We attach as much importance to friendship as we do  to disavowal. These two go together. To prevent a new crisis  and with the agreement of the esteemed leader [Khamene'i], we  prevented the occurrence of a new sedition in Arabia.    We do not think it is appropriate under the current  conditions in the world of Islam ...[sentence incomplete as  heard] The world of Islam has many crisis points: Afghanistan,  Tajikistan, Nagorno-Karabakh, Bosnia, Palestine, Somalia, Iraq  -- and recently, unfortunately, Yemen in which a senseless,  wrong-headed civil war has been started and in which Muslims are  being sacrificed for the selfishness and ambitions of various  individuals and factions. The blood of the people is being  shed, the wealth of the poor people of this region is being  burned. We have so many crisis points. The leader of the  revolution wisely prevented another crisis taking shape.    However, the Saudis should think harder about this issue. A  task that does not cause them any disruption and which can be  correctly undertaken with the agreement of both sides  ...[sentence incomplete as heard]. A hajj that means hajj to a  Shiite can take place. We hope that the situation they created  this year will act as a lesson to them so that it is not  repeated next year. [passage omitted]    We hope that we can have a program acceptable to both sides  for next year's hajj in which both our views and the views of  the Saudis are catered for, and through which the Saudis'  concerns will be alleviated. [passage omitted]    Finally I would like to refer to my recent visit to Gilan  Province. If I deliver a sermon after such visits I usually  refer to them and explain a few issues. People are quite aware  and I only mention a few points. Many things became clearer to  us during that visit. Indeed we saw Gilan Province full of  epic, solidly on the [revolution] scene, faithful to the  revolution and supportive of our imam [Khomeyni] and our leader  [Khamene'i]. [passage omitted]    Anywhere we went masses of people gathered -- in Rasht and  other provinces -- which was even beyond our expectations.  Usually the end of the crowd could not be seen. People were so  happy and cheerful which made one wonder about the amazing  negative propaganda bombardment that our people are subjected  to. Various podiums within the country, media and foreign radios  usually enlarge problems. They speak of high prices, inflation,  economic and political problems, and other small talk. They  speak of ordinary incidents as huge incidents causing  insecurity. And such a great deal of propaganda bombardment has  not had the slightest effect on the people. That is very  strange. Why are our people so aware? Of course that awareness  does not exist only in Gilan Province. [passage omitted]    I think that our people see the realities of life and  juxtapose them against this misleading propaganda and slogans  and realize how much the revolution has done for them.

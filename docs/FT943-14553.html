			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / FT man offered Independent editorship The shareholders of The Independent yesterday decided to offer the editorship of the loss-making newspaper to Mr Ian Hargreaves, deputy editor of the Financial Times. Mr Hargreaves, 43, has been the favourite for the post - which is one of the most challenging in British national journalism - for some time. The decision by the shareholders to make a formal offer was taken at a telephone conference yesterday morning. The main shareholders of Newspaper Publishing, the holding company of The Independent and The Independent on Sunday, include El Pas of Spain, La Repubblica of Italy, Independent Newspapers of Ireland and Mirror Group Newspapers. Some weeks ago Mr Andreas Whittam Smith, the main founder of The Independent, agreed to stand down as editor once a replacement had been found. Mr Whittam Smith will remain as chairman of Newspaper Publishing. It was Mr Whittam Smith who last night offered the editorship of the newspaper that he created to Mr Hargreaves. Mr Hargreaves is now considering the offer, but has not yet accepted it. Newspaper Publishing is believed to be losing about Pounds 1m a month although this could be halved once the business side of the company is fully integrated with Mirror Group Newspapers.</p>

			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER;  </P> <P> CITY RENEWS DRIVE TO IMPROVE STOREFRONTS  </P> <P> The City Council decided this week to increase its efforts to get local  business owners to participate in the city's storefront rebate program, which  so far has received a cool reception.  </P> <P> The program was initiated in September and is designed to help businesses  improve the exterior appearance of their buildings, with the city footing a  large chunk of the bill.  </P> <P> Redevelopment Agency members expressed concern over the lack of interest shown  in the program.  </P> <P> "We don't want to make it a requirement to participate, but we do want to  encourage the businesses," Mayor Charles V. Smith said.  </P> <P> Through the program, businesses can obtain money for: removal of old signs,  awnings and exterior clutter; cleaning or painting exteriors; and the purchase  and installation of new signs, awnings and landscaping.  </P> <P> They also can receive design assistance and construction-management advice.  </P> <P> The program is targeted for buildings on blocks where improvements are  scheduled to be made and along major traffic thoroughfares where buildings  appear cluttered.  </P> <P> Cash rebates of up to 75% are available for businesses that meet the program's  criteria. Smaller percentages are available for larger jobs.  </P> <P> The Redevelopment Agency instructed city staff to take a more aggressive  approach in getting businesses to participate. Letters detailing the program  will be sent with new business licenses, and a brochure on the program is in  the works.  </P> <P> City Manager Jerry Kenny said the personal touch is needed to make the program  work as it has in other cities across the state.  </P> <P> "Agency members and staff need to go out in the streets promoting the project  instead of waiting for phone calls," Kenny said.

			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / OFT sets sights on drug prices The Office of Fair Trading said yesterday it would challenge fixed prices for over-the-counter drugs and medicines if it succeeds with a similar action to end the Net Book Agreement. Although it has only begun a preliminary examination of pharmaceutical retailing, the OFT warned that the removal of a system of prices fixed by manufacturers on proprietorial drugs would be a logical move if the Restrictive Practices Court accepted its demand to end the system with books. This allows publishers to set minimum cover prices for books, and is the only other area still covered by retail price maintenance. Over-the-counter drugs and medicines have been subject to retail price maintenance since 1971, when they were granted an exemption under the Restrictive Practices Act to ensure the widest possible availability of common treatments such as aspirin. Analysts said the removal of price maintenance could lead to reduced profits among pharmaceutical manufacturers because lower prices were unlikely to be offset by sharp increases in volume sales. Any change in the pricing formula would not affect own-label products sold by large retailers such as Boots, which are not subject to the price maintenance formula.</p>

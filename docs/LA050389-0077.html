			<p><P> May 3, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> About 70 people have been arrested during the last several months at truck  stops in Fresno, Kings and Kern counties as part of a campaign against the sale  and use of illegal drugs by truck drivers, state Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp  said. Similar undercover operations have been conducted in the Southern  California and Sacramento areas, he said, with the statewide arrest total in  the campaign now about 250. Van de Kamp said he was surprised by how openly  methamphetamines and other drugs are sold at truck stops in California.  </P></p>

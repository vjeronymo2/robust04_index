			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STORIES ON FLIGHT OF TONY ALIENGENA  </P> <P> This letter is to express my appreciation for the wonderful news stories that  you are writing about the flight of Tony Aliengena around the world and across  Russia.  </P> <P> The amazing thing is that his and Lance Allyn's trip is to places that are not  on the map. My 20-year-old world globe does not show Tumen, Bratsk or Mirnyi,  not to mention Providenia. David Puckett's terrific map (July 2) may cause a  million California readers to focus in on the vastness of the Soviet Union. I  for one, a pilot of a single-engine Beechcraft Bonanza based in Orange County,  am sometimes aloft with these California adventurers, looking down on the  wilderness (without rescue systems) and with my head in the engine compartment  thinking about alternators, fuel system, hot pistons, oil pressure, magnetos  holding together and hoping that the Russian navigators also know emergency  landing fields.  </P> <P> Although they are no Lindberghs, Howard Hugheses or Wiley Posts, these  California fliers in their small Cessnas, Beechcrafts, flying over this great  Siberian topography, they are in some ways "pushing the outside of the  envelope."  </P> <P> RUSSELL W. CARPENTER  </P> <P> Newport Beach  </P></p>

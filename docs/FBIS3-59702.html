It was followed by full scale  R&amp;D of power plants which started in the late 1970s.  <H5>  Phosphoric Acid Fuel Cells </H5> <H5>  (1) Development of On-site 200-kW Fuel Cells </H5>   Mitsubishi Electric Corp. (MELCO) has been developing the  phosphoric acid fuel cell (PAFC) with the intention of early  practical use, through the advancement of component technology  and demonstration power plants, mostly conducted under the  ``Moonlight Project'' promoted by the Agency of Industrial  Science and Technology, MITI. As a typical activity, the 200-kW  cogeneration system installed at the Hotel Plaza was able to  obtain excellent results in both performance and practicability  through the field operation, and accomplished more than 130,000  hours generation at the end of October, 1991.    The second 200-kW power plant for Kansai Electric Power Co.,  Inc. (KEPCO) was installed on Rokko Island in November, 1991 as  a demonstration project of new power generation for dispersed  use, supported by MITI, and various testings such as switching  to the isolated grid without interruption at an occurrence of  utility failure are progressing successfully.    The third 200-kW on site co-generation plant for the  Technical Research Center (TRC) of KEPCO was installed in April  1993 and operation is now being conducted. (Figure 1 [figure not  reproduced])    Most recently, a 200-kW system for Yanai P/S of Chugoku  Electric Power Co., was installed in May 1993, aiming to test  for dispersed use. (Figure 2 [figure not reproduced])  <H5>  (2) Status and Plan of PAFC Development </H5>   It can be said that the basic technology for PAFC has  already  been developed and verified through the aforementioned  experiences. At present, development efforts on PAFC are made to  realize a compact and low cost plant with high reliability which  can meet the market needs.    Table 1 shows our activities and plans for 200-kW PAFC. The  technical subjects in Table 1 are going to be overcome for the  next plant and commercial plants.       Table 1.

This process is subdivided into direct  reforming and indirect reforming. The development of the direct  internal reforming (DIR) type has been carried out under support  by NEDO. A 5kW stack (5000cm&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt; , 10 cells) was  successfully operated for more than one year (10,190 hours) with  the decay rate of 4mV/1000 hours, performance of averaged cell  voltage of 0.78V at 150 mA/cm&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt; , 80&percnt; fuel  utilization. In addition, a 30kW stack is now under operation  and shows good performance which meets the target set by NEDO.  (Figure 3 [figure not reproduced])    The indirect internal reforming (IIR) type has a structure  in  which the reforming catalyst is placed in separate containers  and inserted between stacked cells. Although its power  generating efficiency is lower than that of the direct type, it  is free from the problem of catalyst deterioration and it can  expect an early practical application. MELCO is pursuing the  development of the indirect type jointly with the Kansai  Electric Co., Inc. A 100-kW stack was successfully operated in  1992. Output power of the stack was 109kW and it was operated  for 2,308 hours. In the testing, CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  recycle and the  use of city gas were evaluated.    Based on the results accumulated in these years, a new  concept which hybridizes DIR with IIR, is now going to be  developed. A 5-kW stack for conceptual evaluation is already  successfully being operated now. This concept brings high system  efficiency as well as long life time which leads to a practical  next generation technology (dispersed and/or central power  station application) in the near future.</p>

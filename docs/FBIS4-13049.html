			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, April 18 (AFP)--The return of around 50  banned or wanted Palestinians to the occupied territories,  scheduled for Sunday [17 April], has been delayed by  formalities, the Palestinian chief negotiator Nabil Sha'th said  late Sunday.    The difficulties are being resolved and the exiles could be  brought together in Egypt or Jordan Monday from where they could  be transferred to the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, Sha'th told  reporters here.    The delay resulted from the fact that Palestinians who were  outside Jordan and Egypt needed to gain visas for the two  countries, said Sha'th, who is leading negotiations with Israel  on Palestinian self-rule on the Gaza Strip and in the West Bank  town of Jericho.    An official from PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat's Fatah  organisation said 17 out of the 50 Palestinians would have gone  to Gaza from Egypt Sunday but for the technical problems.    A first group of 50 banned Palestinians returned to the  occupied territories on April 5.</p>

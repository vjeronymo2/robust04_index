			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Low counter seen The possibility of a counter bid for Scottish supermarket chain William Low sent the shares powering ahead 17 to 253p, well above the 225p a share agreed offer made by Tesco the previous day. Most of the support reflected the surprise announcement by J. Sainsbury that it was considering its options. But the market was also scratching around for other possible candidates. There was a feeling that some overseas groups might grab at the chance to grab Low's 6.6 per cent of Scottish market share. Two names that attracted some consideration were Rewe, one of Germany's largest food retailers and Dairy Farm International, the food retailing arm of Hong Kong's Jardine Matheson. The pressure on the bidder and potential bidder saw Tesco restrained to a rise of only a half to 233p and Sainsbury fall 2 1/2 to 397p.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Alves Antonio in Lusaka] </F>   [Text] Good afternoon. The Lusaka talks are still at a  standstill. A few changes have occurred over the past few hours  although Alioune Blondin Beye has stepped up his contacts with  government and National Union for the Total Independence of  Angola [UNITA] representatives. This morning Beye received in  separate audiences the leaders of the government and UNITA  negotiating teams. Nothing concrete is known about the outcome  of the meetings. Sources close to the mediators say the meeting  discussed issues linked to the resumption of the talks and the  peace process which have led to the present impasse.    It can be concluded that members of the UNITA team are still  indisposed because of the latest military operations in Angola.  To confirm this, today's edition of the TIMES OF ZAMBIA  carries an accusation by UNITA about the operations. Political  circles in Lusaka noted that those who sow the wind, reap the  whirlwind. They questioned who has been shelling the city of  Cuito and other areas in Angola.    Meanwhile, [name indistinct], head of the UN Office of  Public  Information, arrived in Lusaka today on a two-day visit. He  will assess what progress has been made at the talks, and then  will go to Luanda to meet Angolan officials.    This morning, the government and UNITA negotiating teams  held  separate meetings to discuss their own strategies. It is likely  that the negotiators will return to the negotiating table at any  moment in view of the urgent need for peace in Angola.</p>

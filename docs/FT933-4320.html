			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Decline of 'steady job' creating an unstable society, says Monks THE EROSION of employment security in Britain is creating an unstable society and contributing to the rise in crime, Mr John Monks, the TUC's general secretary elect, warned yesterday. In his first speech to the Congress at Brighton, Mr Monks said 'overmighty unions' were a thing of the past. 'Dictatorship of the bad employer' was today's reality for far too many people, he said. His address, which was politely rather than enthusiastically received, was partly overshadowed by the continuing argument over the readmission of the electricians' union to the TUC. After the speech, Mr Monks attended an emergency meeting of union leaders which agreed that complainant unions could put their case to the general council today. His speech reflected his efforts to reach beyond the union movement's blue-collar, northern stereotype with a theme of the decline of the 'steady job'. 'What's on offer today is fixed-term contracts, contract working, part-time working, all too often forced down people's throats,' Mr Monks said. 'It's as true now for the white-collar professional as it is for the manual worker. It's as true in the south as it is in the north.' He linked rising crime and drug addiction to the effects that 'unemployment, casualisation and no prospects are having'. Britain, he added, was no longer the workshop of the world but had become 'a warehouse bulging with imports'. Mr Monks, who has developed a friendly relationship with Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, said the TUC wanted 'to contribute to public policy on training, health and safety, employment law and making Britain work better'. He said he would be testing Mr Hunt's offer of an 'open door' to the TUC. Officials said later a meeting with Mr Hunt had been planned and training would be at the top of the agenda. On a more optimistic note, Mr Monks told Congress: 'The tide of opinion is turning and in it lies the force which can be harnessed to regenerate British trade unionism.' He said raising the morale of active trade unionists would be crucial to the campaigns ahead, particularly efforts to persuade members to vote for the automatic 'check-off' of union dues by employers. Mr Monks, who takes over as general secretary on Friday, is more comfortable in the TV studio than the conference hall but most delegates said his address reflected the key themes facing the unions.

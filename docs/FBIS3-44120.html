			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] (Mateus Mufambira), the political adviser appointed  by the Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] to Nampula  Province, has resigned from his post. He described his  appointment as defamatory.    NOTICIAS reports that (Mateus Mufambira) has sent a letter  to  President Joaquim Chissano asking him to remove him from that  post in his capacity as the official responsible for appointing  persons to such posts. In his letter, (Mateus Mufambira) says  he was appointed without Renamo consulting him beforehand  concerning his availability. He also says he has never been a  Renamo sympathizer or member.    Carvalho Pensado, political adviser to Renamo leader Afonso  Dhlakama, told NOTICIAS that he cannot understand such hypocrisy  on the part of (Mateus Mufambira). Pensado added that  (Mufambira's) appointment came as a result of previous contacts  and that (Mufambira) himself had expressed a willingness to  occupy that post.    (Mateus Mufambira) is a teacher at Primeiro de Maio  Preuniversity School in Nampula. He was born in Buzi, in Sofala  Province.</p>

			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report Copper prices on the LME continued to derive support from technical factors following Wednesday's chart advance. But stiff resistance was seen around Dollars 2,230 a tonne for three-month metal. Fresh consumer interest is needed to maintain the recent rally, dealers said, otherwise prices may drift back below Dollars 2,220. On Comex prices were also ahead at midday. 'The rally seems more technical in nature than fundamental but there is a continued and growing optimism the market will see some strong Chinese demand. The key in near term is for March to hold above Dollars 1,' said one observer. Meanwhile, Codelco said its Chuquicamata mine produced less fine copper than it was expected to in January because it had to process harder ore rocks, lowering its milling capacity. Lead matched the general trend in LME base metals and edged higher as the technical picture started to look constructive. Tin lost further ground on profit taking prompted by recent six-month highs. But tightness around April and a shortage of quality metal continues to support underlying sentiment. Weak New York arabica coffee futures put pressure on London, where plentiful supplies of robustas were already keeping a lid on the market. Compiled from Reuters</p>

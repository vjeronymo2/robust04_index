			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Carlos Roberto Reina by reporters </F> Roberto Reyes and Lourdes Bonilla at the Presidential Palace in  Tegucigalpa; date not given --recorded]    [Excerpt] [Reyes] Mr. President, there was an announcement  to allow timber cutting, contradicting an Executive Branch order  on this matter.    [Reina] A commission has been tasked with regulating the ban  we announced. Anyone not abiding by our decision will be  punished.    [Bonilla] There has also been talk regarding the charges by  U.S. Senator Jesse Helms against Former President Rafael  Leonardo Callejas. Will the Executive Branch support any action  the prosecutor general may take to clarify the matter?    [Reina] You are posing two questions. One has to do with the  letters the former president and Senator Helms have exchanged,  which, as I said, is an interesting and important debate. The  other question deals with our support for the prosecutor  general; it is absolute. It is not easy to make a moral  revolution. I want you to notice how attentive people are to any  act of dishonesty. This is putting honesty in vogue. That is  taking a step forward and is very positive. As for the former  president, I will voice no opinion out of courtesy.    [Bonilla] Mr. President, is it true you have a document or  that the U.S. Government or Senator Helms has forwarded to you  documents outlining the involvement of Former President Callejas  in acts of corruption.    [Reina] I can clearly tell you that I have not received that  document.    [Reyes] [Words indistinct] there were reportedly illegal  actions?    [Reina] Anyone violating the law in this country will be  punished. I have announced that in all my speeches. I said I  will put an end to impunity. I am asking you to help in that  task of making a moral revolution. [passage omitted]</p>

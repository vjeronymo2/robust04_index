			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Previous Federal Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Federal action on  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Poa mannii  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> began as a result of section 12 of the Act, which directed the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution to prepare a report on plants considered to be endangered, threatened, or extinct in the United States. This report, designated as House Document No. 94&hyph;51, was presented to Congress on January 9, 1975. On July 1, 1975, the Service published a notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (40 FR 27823) of its acceptance of the Smithsonian report as a petition within the context of section 4(c)(2) (now section 4(b)(3)) of the Act, and giving notice of its intention to review the status of the plant taxa named therein. As a result of that review, on June 16, 1976, the Service published a proposed rule in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (41 FR 24523) to determine endangered status pursuant to section 4 of the Act for approximately 1,700 vascular plant species. The list of 1,700 plant taxa was assembled on the basis of comments and data received by the Smithsonian Institution and the Service in response to House Document No. 94&hyph;51 and the July 1, 1975,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  publication. General comments received in response to the 1976 proposal are summarized in an April 26, 1978,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  publication (43 FR 17909). In 1978, amendments to the Act required that all proposals over two years old be withdrawn. A one-year grace period was given to proposals already over two years old. On December 10, 1979, the Service published a notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (44 FR 70796) withdrawing the portion of the June 16, 1976, proposal that had not been made final, including  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Poa mannii,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> along with four other proposals that had expired. The Service published updated notices of review for plants on December 15, 1980 (45 FR 82479), September 27, 1985 (50 FR 39525), and February 21, 1990 (55 FR 6183).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Poa mannii  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> was first included in the 1980 and 1985 notices of review as a category 1 species. Category 1 taxa are those for which the Service has on file substantial information on biological vulnerability and threats to support preparation of listing proposals. In the 1990 notice of review,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Poa mannii  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> was considered a category 1* species. Category 1* taxa are those which are possibly extinct. Since the 1990 notice of review, three previously unknown populations of the species have been discovered, and a population has been found in an area in which the plant was formerly known.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Act requires the Secretary to make findings on petitions that present substantial information indicating that the petitioned action may be warranted within 12 months of their receipt. Section 2(b)(1) of the 1982 amendments further required all petitions pending on October 13, 1982, be treated as having been newly submitted on that date. On October 13, 1983, the Service found that the petitioned listing of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Poa mannii  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> was warranted, but precluded by other pending listing actions, in accordance with section 4(b)(3)(B)(iii) of the Act; notification of this finding was published on January 20, 1984 (49 FR 2485). Such a finding requires the Service to consider the petition as having been resubmitted pursuant to section 4(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Act. The finding was reviewed in October of 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, and 1991. Publication of the proposed rule constituted the final 1-year finding for this species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On April 7, 1993, the Service published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (58 FR 18073) a proposal to list the plant  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Poa mannii  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> as endangered. This proposal was based primarily on information supplied by Hawaii State Department of Land and Natural Resources unpublished reports and observations by botanists and naturalists. The Service now determines  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Poa mannii  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> to be endangered with the publication of this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Summary of Comments and Recommendations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the April 7, 1993, proposed rule and associated notifications, all interested parties were requested to submit factual reports or information that might contribute to the development of a final rule. The public comment period ended June 7, 1993. Appropriate State agencies, county governments, Federal agencies, scientific organizations, and other interested parties were contacted and requested to comment. A newspaper notice inviting public comment was published in ``The Honolulu Advertiser'' on May 12, 1993, and ``The Garden Isle'' on May 16, 1993. No letters of comment were received.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Summary of Factors Affecting the Species  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

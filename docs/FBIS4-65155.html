			<p>BFN     [Text] The Hague, 10 May (ANP) -- Netherlands Development  Aid Minister Pronk is leaving on Wednesday [11 May] for a visit  to Rwanda, where fighting over recent weeks has left thousands  dead. During his six-day trip, the minister also will visit  refugee camps in the border area with Uganda and Tanzania, and  hold talks with aid organizations in Kenya.    Pronk wants to see for himself how the process of providing  aid for the victims of the violence is proceeding and what  further assistance the Netherlands could provide. The  Netherlands has already granted 8.4 million guilders  (approximately 1.5 billion Belgian francs) in emergency aid for  Rwanda and Burundi this year. From 14 May, the Netherlands aid  organizations will be running a special campaign to raise funds  for Rwanda.    The minister will first visit Uganda, from where he will  visit refugee camps in the border area with northern Rwanda and  talk with representatives from the aid organizations and  possibly also with RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] members. He  will also meet with Ugandan President Museveni and his deputy  minister for refugee affairs.    On Saturday and Sunday, the minister will be in the Kenyan  capital Nairobi for talks with international and private aid  organizations, before flying on to Ngara in northwest Tanzania  where hundreds of thousands of Rwandan refugees have gathered.  Their number is rapidly increasing and the situation in  northwest Tanzania is deteriorating daily.    The aid organization Caritas warned on Monday [9 May] that  famine on an unknown scale threatened in Rwanda and neighboring  Burundi. An estimated 2 million people have left their homes  due to last month's outbreak of ethnic violence in Rwanda which  followed the assassination of the country's president.</p>

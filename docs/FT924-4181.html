			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / International Company News: Caterpillar reverses forecast to 'modest' loss CATERPILLAR, one of North America's largest heavy equipment exporters, yesterday said it expected to take a loss in the fourth quarter. The company had earlier told shareholders it expected a modest profit in the quarter, excluding the gain from the sale of its lift truck joint venture and the impact of adopting new accounting standards. Caterpillar reversed its profit projection after recording weak sales in Europe and higher-than-expected losses from its Brazilian opera-tions. The company said it was now projecting a 'modest' loss if the Dollars 50m to Dollars 65m gain from the truck operation was included, and the impact of the new accounting standards excluded. Mr Thomas Burns, securities analyst for County NatWest USA, said the projection translated into a loss of about 60 cents a share from operations in the fourth quarter, or a deficit of about Dollars 2.20 a share for the year. The group said it would have to take additional write-offs in the quarter for consolidating its two Brazilian plants. Higher forecasts for losses from foreign exchange translations would also hurt fourth-quarter results, the company said. Caterpillar said its outlook for 1993 continued to depend on the strength of economic recoveries in North America and Europe. The company also said that some US customers might be deferring purchases originally intended for 1992 until 1993 because they were waiting for details of a new investment tax credit programme Caterpillar shares fell Dollars 2 1/4 yesterday to close at Dollars 43 3/8 in New York following the company's forecast.</p>

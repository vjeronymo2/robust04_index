			<p>BFN     [Text] Chisinau, BASAPRESS, 25/06/1994 -- The fourth  Congress of Intelligentsia was held today in Chisinau. Some 400  delegates representing most Moldovan localities and numerous  guests including Ion Solcanu, deputy chairman of the Romanian  Senate and U.S. and Romanian Embassy representatives. Alexandra  Mosanu, Congress of Intelligentsia (CI) chairman, stated in the  report that "the socio-political movement, Congress of  Intelligentsia, was born under conditions of political crisis  which were caused in late 1992-early 1993 by the Moldovan  president and forces supporting him." According to Mosanu, a  short time after its set-up the CI succeeded in affirming itself  in the political arena. The parliamentary elections showed that  this formation "has established itself within the society."  Specifying that the Peasants and Intellectuals Block won over  163,000 votes, thus 11 seats in the Parliament, Mosanu gauged  that "in general, the election results were modest for this  block." He also mentioned that "the pro-imperialist reactionary  forces fight against the freedom conquered by the national  emancipation movement and Moldovan independence as well. Subtly  manipulated by officials, many citizens fell in the trap of  Romanophobia, while others are overwhelmed by apathy and  indifference or by nostalgia for the former communist regime."  According to Mosanu, a major reason for the "the  agrarian-interfrontists' victory" in elections was "the  preservation of the old structures of the totalitarian regime in  economic and state administration as well as the seizure of  important positions in the national private economy by  anti-national forces." At the Cl leadership's proposal the  delegates changed the name of the formation to the Moldovan  United Democratic Congress [CDUM]. Several changes were  introduced into the statute and thus the adherence of certain  parties to the congress was facilitated. Leaders of the  Democratic Party and Christian Democratic Party declared their  adherence to the Congress. They argued that the congress  facilitated the conditions for adherence and that the objectives  and social foundation of the parties are almost identical. They  also said that it is necessary "to unite all national democratic  movements." The wish to "merge with the Congress on the basis  of its statute and program" was reiterated by most speakers.  Nicolae Dabija, CI deputy chairman, stated that fruitful  negotiations concerning a future merger with representatives of  several parties were held. Deputy Valeriu Matei was elected  chairman of the United Democratic Congress. According to the  CDUM, the post of chairman can be retained two consecutive  periods. The CDUM session -- the new name of the supreme  meeting of the formation -- elected other leading organs.</p>

			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / Headway in Congress on gun control: Clinton plans crime crusade US congressional leaders were yesterday negotiating a final version of gun control legislation, after the Senate, under extreme public pressure, passed a bill on the issue by 63 votes to 36. The Brady Bill, named after its chief proponent Mr James Brady, who was wounded in a 1981 assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan, imposes a waiting period of five business days on the purchase of hand guns. The waiting period would give dealers time to check the background of gun purchasers. The Senate decision came in response to a flood of voters' telephone calls at the weekend which forced Republicans to abandon a filibuster that had threatened to scuttle the legislation. 'It's time to put the Brady bill behind us,' said Senator Robert Dole, the Republican leader yesterday. Nonetheless, he voted against the bill. The bill provides for Dollars 200m (Pounds 134.2m) in funding to establish a nationwide computerised system for the instant record check on would-be gun purchasers. This is designed to keep guns out of the hands of convicted criminals and the mentally ill. Mr Brady, a haunting figure in his wheelchair as he lobbied for the legislation, said he was glad the Republicans had 'come to their senses' to end the filibuster. 'The way to stop the carnage on the street is with this small step,' he said. A separate crime bill, passed by the Senate, has additional gun control measures in a ban on the production and sale of some semi-automatic assault weapons, a ban on the sale of hand guns to juveniles and an end to the sale of armour-piercing bullets. While these measures are minimal by international standards, many individual states have moved to tighten gun control rules even further. Senator Patrick Moynihan, a New York Democrat, has talked of taxing the sale of ammunition. President Bill Clinton has suggested he might be willing to ban sales of some types of bullet. Now that anti-crime legislation is due to be signed, Mr Clinton is preparing a public crusade against law-breaking. According to the Washington Post, an inter-agency group including presidential aide Mr David Gurgen is planning a number of presidential trips to stress community efforts against crime. The president is expected to link it to family issues.</p>

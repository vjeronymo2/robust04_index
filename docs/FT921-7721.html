			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Demoralised Red Army turns to sociologists BESIEGED by nationalistic republics and plunging living standards, the Red Army is redeploying lawyers and sociologists within its ranks to help soldiers with pressing social problems. Major-General Nikolai Stolyarov, a former Communist party liberal, said yesterday his committee for work with military staff had substituted the professionals for the old communist commissars - the political officers responsible for everything from ideological rectitude to military welfare. Although he said it was too early for army chaplains, the general disclosed that the Pentagon had promised to supply Russian-language bibles, while scientific atheism courses had been replaced by classes on the history of religion. His answers to questions about Ukraine's decision to demand an oath of allegiance from forces stationed on its territory illustrated the stiff challenge facing the army's top brass. On the one hand, Maj-Gen Stolyarov had to recognise the right of sovereign republics to create their own armies. On the other, he warned of the dangers of undue haste in breaking up a formidable fighting-machine. He said he could not condemn the decision by officers from strategic forces based in the Ukraine - which are supposed to be under joint Commonwealth command - to swear allegiance to the southern republic. 'What awaits them in Russia? Nothing, there are no apartments for them.' Nor could he say to which motherland officers now owed their allegiance. 'We will find a motherland,' he said.</p>

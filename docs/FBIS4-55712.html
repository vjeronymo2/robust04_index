			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["m.t."-signed interview with Ferenc Kosa, parliamentary </F> deputy of the Hungarian Socialist Party; place and date not  given: "Ferenc Kosa: The Socialists Do Not Want a Clear-Up"]    [Text] The media law, which is one of the first to be  passed by the new parliament, will define the operation of Radio  and Television and the appointment of their leaders. The  Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] instructed Ferenc Kosa to draw  up the Socialists' media law concept when the party went into  opposition in 1990. We interviewed Kosa on the media plans of  the MSZP.    [MAGYAR NEMZET] Is the MSZP adhering to the basic principles  that it professed when it was an opposition party?    [Kosa] Already in the transitional period before the 1990  elections, the MSZP was aware that an unbiased, honest, and  socially supervised operation of the information system --  especially public service radio and television -- is a necessary  prerequisite for democracy. I would like to remind people that,  after the 40 years of party state dictatorship, the Nemeth  government set up the Public Supervisory Committee, which, with  the participation of experts and parties that had national  lists, ensured television's impartiality during the elections.  As for the media law, the MSZP's concept has three cardinal  points: public ownership, public supervision, and clear and  unequivocal public service statutes. In respect to public  service media, we rejected both state ownership and free market  ownership. If the radio and television are in state ownership  then the government of the day can influence their operation.  We do not support the free market, either, because foreign  interests can endanger national sovereignty.    [MAGYAR NEMZET] Who should own the public service media?    [Kosa] The MSZP considers socialist ownership in its  classical sense appropriate, namely public ownership. Legally,  the public foundation corresponds to this. The public  foundation is a form of ownership that cannot be sold, which is  created by a two-thirds majority decision of Parliament, and  which does not operate under the government's or any party's  influence, and not even solely under Parliament's influence.  Its Supervisory Board consists of a broad social basis: The  delegates of political forces, professional trade unions,  independent personalities, trade unions, and churches. Its  members can be replaced. This way, it is possible to eliminate  disproportionately large personal or group interests that can  appear in the public service media. The Board cannot exercise  censorship rights.    [MAGYAR NEMZET] Is there any chance for the MSZP's media  plans to be accepted by parliament?    [Kosa] Even in the past, the MSZP's media policy was a  consensus-making alternative to the government's state ownership  and the liberals' free market solutions. If the MSZP comes to  power, it will continue to insist on its basic principles.  Accordingly, it wants a media and press that are independent of  the government and political forces. It is a precondition of  democracy that the press be able to operate freely as a  criticizing counterbalance to the governing power.    [MAGYAR NEMZET] In recent days, a list of names has come to  light that foreshadows the dismissals in television that are to  follow the change of the government....    [Kosa] The Socialists do not have any intentions to clear  up; the MSZP does not want to replace the personnel in the  media. We would like the country to be among the leaders in  Europe as regards democracy and the independence of the public  service media. The draft bill proposed by us serves this goal.    [MAGYAR NEMZET] What are the MSZP's views on the rules of  appointing radio and television chairmen?    [Kosa] The appointment of the chairmen is one paragraph in  an 800-paragraph draft bill. In accordance with the  constitutional rules in this area, the prime minister proposes  the media chairmen, the parliamentary Cultural Committee hears  them and forms an opinion on them, and finally the president of  the republic appoints them. In our view, this system is  democratic. The freely elected responsible government of the  day should have the possibility to make a proposal on the  people, but it should not have the sole right to appoint them.  In this sense, the president of the Republic and the Cultural  Committee form a counterweight to the government. The basis of  the process of appointment should not be changed, but it is  expedient to make minor amendments. It would not be fortuitous  if parliament appointed the chairmen because it cannot have the  rights of an employer. The fact that we do not have a legal  order in this area is the reason for the speculations  surrounding the issue of media chairmen. When we have a media  law, the appointment of the chairmen will be a natural procedure  without any hysteria. This is the reason the MSZP insists that  the issue of the media chairmen only be put on the agenda once  the media law is passed.</p>

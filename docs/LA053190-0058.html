			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SANTA MONICA'S LIPSCOMB ENJOYS LIFE IN FAST LANE  </P> <P> Santa Monica High's Felice Lipscomb recorded the second-fastest time in the  nation this season in the 300-meter low hurdles Friday night at the CIF  Master's meet at Cerritos College.  </P> <P> Unfortunately for Lipscomb, the fastest time was set in the same race by  defending state champion Twila Sims of Lompoc. Sims, a sophomore, came from  behind in the final 10 meters to edge Lipscomb, 42.29 seconds to 42.30. The  finish-line judge needed to review the film before declaring a winner.  </P> <P> Earlier, Lipscomb easily won the 100-meter low hurdles in 13.97. Sims finished  third with a 14.55.  </P> <P> Both will attempt to improve their times Friday and Saturday at the State Track  and Field Championships at Cerritos College.  </P> <P> Lipscomb, a USC-bound senior, is the defending state champion in the 100  hurdles and hasn't been beaten in the race this season. She's lost only twice  in the past three years. But her real challenge remains the 300 hurdles.  </P> <P> Since Lipscomb began running track as a freshman four years ago, Santa Monica  Coach Mike Griswold has been trying to persuade her to run the 300 hurdles.  Lipscomb, who preferred the sprint races, refused to run the race.  </P> <P> "I must have asked her 200 times," Griswold said. "But since Felice was  enjoying such success in the shorter races, she didn't see the reasoning in  adding the longer hurdle race. Running 300 meters meant more pain, and she  wasn't interested in that."  </P> <P> Finally in January on their way to a press conference for the Sunkist Indoor  Invitational, Lipscomb gave in to her coach's plea and agreed to drop the  100-meter dash for the 300 hurdles. Although Sims, 16, has beaten her three  times in the event this season, Lipscomb, 18, has improved in each race and  appears ready to unseat the defending champion.  </P> <P> Sims easily defeated Lipscomb in the 300 hurdles in their first meeting at the  Northridge Invitational two months ago, but barely beat her in their second  race at the Arcadia Invitational in April. At the Master's meet, Lipscomb lead  most of the race until Sims was able to overtake her on the final hurdle.  </P> <P> "I think the fact the I'm finishing second to Twila after only one year of  competing in this race is quite an accomplishment," Lipscomb said. "I'm looking  at state as if I have nothing to lose. I'm not the defending champ (in 300  hurdles), so the pressure isn't on me. I feel like I'm a contender, though, and  hope that I can win the race."  </P> <P> Griswold predicts a double victory for Lipscomb in the 100 and 300 hurdles.  </P> <P> "Felice is the fastest hurdler in the state by far," he said. "How she finishes  depends on how hard she wants to work."  </P> <P> One thing favoring Lipscomb is her strong desire to compete. She started  running track after being beaten in a race during a gym class in the eighth  grade. When she had the opportunity to join Santa Monica's track team the  following year, Lipscomb decided to go out for the squad.  </P> <P> As a freshman, Lipscomb won the 100 hurdles in the Bay League championships and  qualified for the Southern Section 4-A Division meet. The next year, she won  the event at the Southern Section and Master's meet and finished third at  state. She defended her titles as a junior and won the race at state.  </P> <P> She is a favorite to repeat her title in the event.  </P> <P> Despite Lipscomb's success in the 100 hurdles, Griswold feels her future  remains in the longer hurdle race. He said she could become the best woman  400-meter hurdler in the nation in college.  </P> <P> "Felice has a very long stride for a sprinter," Griswold said. "And she is  extremely quick. If she works hard enough, she could become the first woman  college hurdler to run 13 steps between each hurdle. She's just got the natural  stride."  </P> <P> In the 300 hurdles, Lipscomb runs 14 steps between the first two hurdles and  increases it to 15 steps the rest of the way.  </P> <P> "The reason I didn't run the 300 hurdles earlier is because I didn't want to  concentrate on marking my step," Lipscomb said. "It takes a lot of  concentration. In the 100 hurdles, my stride is all natural. But I'm glad I  decided to add the race. I honestly didn't think I'd do as well as I have."  </P> <P> Sims didn't run the 300 hurdles until the middle of last season, but at  5-foot-9 she has the natural size and speed for the event. Lipscomb, at 5-6,  compensates for her size with quickness.  </P> <P> At the Master's meet, Lipscomb jumped out to an early lead in the 300 hurdles  and lead Sims by several meters midway through the race.  </P> <P> "If I'm going to beat Twila at state, I'm going to have to jump out to an early  lead again and then push it harder over the last few hurdles," Lipscomb said.  "Twila has more endurance, but I have more speed. So, I've got to take  advantage of that. I was a little upset by (Friday's) loss, but I'm ready to  make up for it."  </P> <P> Venice distance runner Danny Jordan is suffering from tendinitis in his right  foot and failed to defend his City Section title in the 1,600 meters. Jordan,  whose best time this season is 4:10.8, finished second at the City finals with  a 4:20.38.  </P></p>

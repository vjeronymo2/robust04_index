			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Stock Exchange sees rise in individuals' share deals Individual investors have increased their participation on the London Stock Exchange for the first time since 1989, figures released yesterday by the exchange show. The Stock Exchange's Quality of Markets Review for autumn shows that in the first nine months of this year individuals' share of turnover, by volume, rose to 16 per cent from 14 per cent a year ago. This comes when overall turnover has been particularly strong. In the third quarter of 1993 the total value of transactions on the London and Irish stock exchanges was a record Pounds 146.7bn, up 2.7 per cent from the third quarter of 1987, the previous quarterly record. But the data suggest that the increased activity is more likely to be the result of individuals selling shares rather than buying them. In bargains of up to Pounds 50,000 in size, where small investors are likely to be the predominant executors, sales of securities marginally outweighed purchases. However, in bargains of Pounds 50,000 or over purchases outweighed sales, particularly for transactions of Pounds 1m or more. Meanwhile, the exchange found that the 'touch' - the average difference between the best buy offer and the best sell offer for a given share - narrowed to its lowest level since the stock market crash of 1987. The average touch has narrowed from 1.2 per cent of share price in January 1992 to 0.7 per cent at the end of September 1993. Some 80 per cent of bargains of Pounds 2,000 or less - likely to have been struck on behalf of individual investors - were conducted at the touch. A narrowing of the touch suggests greater liquidity.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Sardar Asif by Buthaynah </F> Abu-'Ubayd; place and date not given]    [Text] [Abu-'Ubayd] Recently, there has been an increase  in the wave of criticism of the Benazir Bhutto government  claiming that she has reembraced the old approach. This raises  questions about the fate of the current government and its  stability?    [Asif] The internal situation in Pakistan is completely  stable. Reports about tension have no truth whatsoever. The  internal disturbances that take place are provoked by a  neighboring state that always seeks to cause these disturbances  to divert the attention of the Pakistani Government from its  inhuman practices on its border.    [Abu-'Ubayd] How true is the current talk in Islamabad about  the possibility of the Pakistan Muslim League [PML] withdrawing  from its alliance with the ruling Pakistan People's Party,  against the background of widespread mismanagement?    [Asif] I do not want to offend the Pakistani opposition.  However, there is no real problem with the PML. These are only  press headlines. The fact is my presence here is the best  evidence of the continued alliance of the two parties. I am a  member of the PML and I say the party coalition is permanent and  stable. In addition, some religious parties, who posed as our  enemies in the recent elections, have started to cooperate with  the government. Take, for example, the Assembly of Islamic  Clergy led by Maulana Fazlur Rahman.    [Abu-'Ubayd] On the economic level, has the government  fulfilled the promises it made in its election program?    [Asif] We have succeeded in some aspects, particularly the  economic aspects. When we arrived, the Pakistani treasury had  only about three million [currency not specified] in hard  currency. Now, we have two billion. We also got rid of the  floating currency problem, which happened three times during the  government of Nawaz Sharif. Also, the Karachi stock market is  one of the world's five strongest markets.    There is also a major plan for economic reform. However,  before carrying out this plan, we must remove difficulties and  obstacles and pave the way for such reforms. We are currently  trying to avoid the mistakes of the previous government and stop  the negative developments it has caused, such as the financial  crisis suffered by the country.    The IMF has agreed to give Pakistan $3 billion in aid. This  shows the success of our new economic approach, which is also a  subject of interest to world quarters.    [Abu-'Ubayd] As soon as she assumed office, Benazir Bhutto  called a halt to the policy of privatization adopted by her  predecessor. Is there any plan to reintroduce this policy?    [Asif] During the term of Nawaz Sharif, the system of  privatization was used to serve the personal interests of a few  people. The selling and ownership of government sectors was  confined to an elite of his group. Consequently, the money and  shares primarily went to people who are loyal to him, despite  the fact that these sectors are owned by all the people.  Therefore, we terminated and reviewed privatization in light of  the new reform plan. We are now about to start it once again,  but with caution and avoiding any corruption that might affect  it. Within this context, we seek to attract investments and  capital to invest in Pakistan, especially in the energy sector  that yields guaranteed profit amounting to 33 percent.    [Abu-'Ubayd] The rise of the recent government was  surrounded by speculation regarding a retreat to Islamic  fundamentalism. How true is this on the ground?    [Asif] In the recent elections, the religious parties won  only a few votes. There has been a large retreat in religious  fundamentalism in the wake of the elections. It was clear to  everybody that our people resent fundamentalism and extremism  and support moderation and modern approaches. Our people think  political parties can build a new Pakistan better than religious  parties.    [Abu-'Ubayd] What is the aim of the active Pakistani  diplomatic moves toward Iran, including high-level visits  recently?    [Asif] You must be aware of the close relations between Iran  and Pakistan. Iran is a friendly state. We have excellent  relations with it but not at the expense of any other state.    We attach great importance to the north and south of the  Gulf. We are interested in stability in the Gulf as well as in  the Indian sea [as published] region. The Gulf states host more  than 1 million Pakistani nationals. We have important economic  cooperation. We have special ties with the United Arab Emirates  [UAE], in particular. The UAE participates in huge projects and  has huge investments in Pakistan. It is also an important  source of oil for Pakistan. Moreover, during my current visit  to the UAE, I proposed to the brother UAE officials to hold  joint naval maneuvers, as we have already done with Iran and  Oman. This is an indication of our special relations with the  UAE.    Stemming from its good relations with both Iran and the UAE,  Pakistan is prepared to play the role of mediator to resolve  differences and the problem of the occupied islands, and end  tension between the two, if we are asked to do so.    [Abu-'Ubayd] Now that the bilateral talks between Pakistan  and India on the Kashmir issue have stopped, how do you see  relations between the two countries in light of the continuous  border tension?    [Asif] India does not want to resolve the Kashmir issue  through negotiations. The Pakistani side has ascertained that  India did not follow peaceful methods in this issue. Pakistan  wants a peaceful solution based on UN resolutions.    The situation is really serious. Any deviation from the  peaceful path will definitely lead to war in which the  possibility of nuclear escalation will increase. This prompted  the United States to bring India and Pakistan to the negotiating  table.    Meanwhile, we will not remain silent on the mass violations  of human rights in Kashmir. More than 500,000 Indian troops are  deployed in Kashmir, spreading destruction and corruption on a  daily basis. The situation there is more difficult than it is  in Bosnia. We will be right if we call Kashmir the "Bosnia of  Asia."    [Abu-'Ubayd] Following U.S. Assistant Secretary of State  Strobe Talbott's visit, you announced your conditional readiness  to stop your nuclear program. Will this be in exchange for a  U.S. aircraft deal?    [Asif] Pakistan has never refused to sign an agreement to  end  the nuclear race in South Asia. We offered to agree to the U.S.  proposals provided India agreed in the second round of  negotiations and a solution was reached. [sentence as  published] When an agreement is reached on a solution, we will  be prepared to halt our nuclear programs in three stages, which  will inevitably lead to some results. The first is immediate  halt to the atomic project, the second is to return the program  to its first stages, and then stop it altogether. I would like  to assert that Pakistan does not possess a nuclear bomb. But  Pakistan is a nuclear power and has the capability  [al-salahiyah] to produce it at any time. When we reach  agreement with India, we will stop the program completely.    As for the F-16 plane deal, we made it clear to the  Americans  that it should not be linked to the nuclear question. The  United States agreed to the deal in the past and we paid $650  [million] for 38 out of a total of 71 planes.    The U.S. Congress's refusal to approve the deal following  the  Pressler Amendment is a U.S. problem. I am confident that the  Clinton Administration is understanding, and that it is  endeavoring to remove obstacles to approving the deal because of  the differences it engendered in the U.S.-Pakistani relations.    [Abu-'Ubayd] What about your agreement to allow inspection  of  your nuclear facilities?    [Asif] The Americans presented technical proposals on  inspection to ascertain that we do not possess the bomb. After  we study these proposals, we will consider whether or not we  will allow them to monitor.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 16 Jun (XINHUA) -- The general office of  the State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters today  issued this year's flood bulletin No. 1. The bulletin said:  Since the arrival of flood season south of the lower reaches of  the Chang Jiang, the Min Jiang in Fujian and the Xi Jiang in  Guangxi were hit by relatively bigger floods; torrential rains  and flooding occurred in parts of such provinces as Jiangxi,  Guangdong, Fujian, Zhejiang, and Hunan; and major rock-falling  disasters occurred in Wulong County, Sichuan, resulting in  rather serious economic losses. Water situations in other  rivers, streams, and lakes are basically stable.    The bulletin said: A stable rain belt which was formed by  the mutual effect of warm and cold air, and which has persisted  since 12 June from the northern part of southern China to the  southern part of areas situated to the south of the lower  reaches of the Chang Jiang, has successively caused flooding in  the Xi Jiang in Guangxi and the Bei Jiang in Guangdong. At 1400  and 2100 [0600 and 1300 GMT] on 15 June, flood waters moving at  10,100 cubic meters [m] per second and 10,050 cubic m per second  successively hit the Rong Jiang and the Long Jiang, tributaries  of the Xi Jiang. After these two streams of flood waters  converged and entered the Liu Jiang, a flood crest was observed  at the Liuzhou Station along the Liu Jiang at 0600 today. The  crest, with a water level reaching 88.53 m and a flow capacity  of 25,000 cubic m per second, was the third biggest flood water  recorded since the founding of the PRC. Our preliminary  understanding is that Liuzhou City and Prefecture were partly  flooded, with flood water levels generally reaching 2-3 m, and  two people were reported dead at the time this news dispatch was  sent. At 1000 today, water level measured at the Liuzhou  Station along the Liu Jiang had dropped to 88.45 m. However,  moderate to torrential rainfall would persist in the Xi Jiang  reaches, with heavy rains falling in part of those areas. It is  estimated that the flooding would possibly continue for some  time.    Following the natural disaster, the Guangxi Zhuang  Autonomous  Regional party committee and people's government immediately  convened an emergency meeting to arrange flood fighting and  emergency measures. The general office of the State Flood  Control and Drought Relief Headquarters also sent specially  designated personnel to Guangxi to aid in flood fighting and  relief work.    Since early June, scarce rainfall has continued to cause  drought in most of northern China, the western regions of  northeast China, and the provinces and autonomous regions of  Shandong, Ningxia, and Qinghai. Statistics compiled by the end  of 14 June showed that an area totaling 12.87 million hectares  in the nation was hit by drought. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous  Region, Hebei Province, and Shandong Province each had over 2  million hectares of areas hit by drought.</p>

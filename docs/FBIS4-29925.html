			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 17 (KCNA) -- A great many works of  literature and art high in ideological and artistic value have  been created in Korea.    In the last few years alone, many literary and art works  have  been created, among them the multi-part feature film "The Nation  and Destiny" (part 1 to 18), the revolutionary drama "Under the  Banner of Victory" and the long novel "Victory".    The literature and art of Korea that greeted a great heyday  in the mid-70s under the wise guidance of the dear leader  Comrade Kim Chong-il is now in full bloom with further  development.    Comrade Kim Chong-il founded a unique theory on the  chuche-oriented literature and art that is centred on man, and  established a new creative system to bring an overall renovation  in literature and art and has reared a large army of talented  men of literature and art. He gave answers to all the  theoretical and practical questions arising in the creative work  such as making a good choice of seed and conducting a speed  campaign in creative activities, making a comprehensive and  profound study of life and reflecting it truthfully and  retaining the national style in works through the combination of  ideology and art and has successfully brought into full bloom  the literature and art with untiring energetic guidances.    All realms of literature and art -- movie, opera, music,  drama, dance, fine art and circus -- have reached a high plane  today.    In this course, a host of literary and art works have been  created, representing the glorious and brilliant history of  revolutionary activities, sagacity of leadership and noble  virtues of the great leader President Kim Il-song, and new  "phibada"-style revolutionary operas in which stanzaic songs,  pangchang(off-stage songs), folk dances and stage decor are  organically interlinked and new "songhwangdang"- style  revolutionary dramas.    Works on the themes of revolutionary traditions and  socialist  realities were created in great numbers, including the feature  film "To the End of the World" and "The Trace of Life", the long  and medium-length novels "On the Road of Loyalty" and "The Land  of Flowers", the music and dance epic "Song of Glory" performed  by 5,000 artistes and the music and dance story "The Song of  Paradise".    Many famous songs and elegant dance works such as "Song of  Comradeship", "We Will Go Along One Road Forever" and "Azalea of  the Homeland" were created, national musical instruments were  improved and a new orchestra based on the combination of Western  and national music instruments was created, lifting the chuche  art to a higher stage.    Recent years witnessed the creation of unique Korean-style  electronic music which can represent not only the Korean folk  songs and modern songs but foreign folk songs and traditional  mass songs of other countries as well.    In the meantime, monumental works of art such as the  "Mansudae Grand Monument" and the "Samjiyon Grand Monument" have  been created and various genres of works of art including  paintings, mainly Korean paintings, crafts and embroideries have  been produced.    Acrobatic art and literature and art of amateurs have also  made a rapid progress.</p>

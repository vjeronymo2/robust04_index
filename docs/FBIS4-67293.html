			<p>BFN     [Text] Zahedan (Sistan-Baluchestan), May 14, IRNA -- The  8th Iran-Pakistan joint border commission opened here Saturday  to explore problems and difficulties of the two countries'  border provinces in countering bandits and drug smugglers.    Deputy chief minister of Pakistan's Baluchistan Province who  is heading the delegation, Shirdel, praised Iran's law  enforcement personnel for their decisive campaign against drug  dealers.    Referring to Islamabad's attempts to eradicate narcotics and  drug trafficking, he stressed that Pakistan does not produce any  type of narcotics, and that these drugs are being mass produced  in neighbouring Afghanistan and smuggled into his country.    According to him Pakistan is also serious in its fight  against drug dealers despite its lack of proper facilities and  equipment to deal with them on the long border it shares with  Afghanistan.    Iran's Sistan-Baluchestan Province borders Pakistan's  Baluchestan Province.    Head of the Iranian delegation, Vajihollah Aqa-Taqi who is  in  charge of security-political affairs at the governor-general's  office of Sistan-Baluchestan Province, said Iran will spare no  efforts in promotion of economic links between the neighbouring  provinces.    He assured that Iran will seriously deal with all activities  against Pakistan at the joint borders and will never let border  be a base for subversion inside Pakistan.    He stressed that Iran expects reciprocal treatment from  Pakistan and particularly officials in charge of Baluchistan  Province in this regard.    Outlining Iran's success in the drug campaign, Aqa-Taqi  announced that the law enforcement personnels have seized over  10 tons of narcotics in the border regions during the first  month of the Iranian calendar Farvardin which ended on April 20.  Iran-Pakistan joint border commission which is being held bi-  annually will last 3 days.</p>

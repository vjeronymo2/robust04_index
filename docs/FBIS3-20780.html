They have  only achieved successes in the military area. From the  standpoint of the military achievements during the three years  of war, we would have to include among the key strategic changes  in the area of the former Yugoslavia the formation of the  Serbian parastates west of the Drina River. That process took  place in parallel with the military strengthening of Serbia and  Montenegro, which absorbed almost the entire military potential  of the former federal state. During the year-long convergent  withdrawal of the JNA [Yugoslav People's Army] from the west and  the south, Serbia turned into a regional military power; it  became the domicile for the withdrawing units, and for almost  the entire equipment, elements of defense industry, and reserves  of the former federal state. With the international community's  embargo on importing weapons into the states that were the  victims of Serbian aggression, the other states were prevent  from successfully opposing it.    To illustrate the transformation of the federation of Serbia  and Montenegro into a regional power, we should mention that at  the beginning of this year, the following military resources  were on its territory--which encompasses only 102,350 square  kilometers and is 2.5 times smaller than the former Yugoslavia:    --135,000-150,000 troops (the number varies because of  occasional mobilization and other exercises, for which military  conscripts are drafted);    --1,100 combat tanks (300 M-84's and 800 T-54/55's);    --1,170 combat armored personnel carriers;    --1,900 self-propelled and towed cannons for infantry  support  (105-mm and larger calibers);    --187 multiple rocket launchers;    --3,000 large-caliber mortars (120 mm);    --3,400 medium-caliber mortars (82 mm);    --4,100 recoilless cannons;    --282 self-propelled antiarmor missile launchers;    --1,330 antiarmor cannon (70- to 100-mm calibers);    --480 combat aircraft;    --136 armed helicopters;    --a fleet (five torpedo submarines, four assault submarines,  four frigates, 12 missile boats, and 12 torpedo boats).    It is obvious from the number of weapons that during the  three years of war the so-called Yugoslavia's army has not  reduced its weaponry, but instead has increased it even further.  We could seek the causes only partly in purchases (25 MiG-29's,  SCUD missiles, new long-range antiaircraft missiles), because  the main supplier has been its own defense industry. In contrast  to the rest of industry, which is operating at 20 to 25 percent  of capacity in Serbia, the defense industry plants are said to  be operating at three times higher a capacity, with the plants  that the Serbs evacuated from Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia  already equipped for production last year. They are producing on  a particularly large scale 120-mm mortars, new types of shells  (with proximity detonators and a rocket motor), large-caliber  sniper rifles (12.7 mm), and so forth.    If, in addition to the number of soldiers, we also take into  account the paramilitary units (the party militias, which are  well-armed with light infantry weapons and well-trained, because  some of their members are constantly operating in territories  west of the Drina), then we can ascertain that the so-called  Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY] has about 205,000-220,000  people under arms (this figure does not include the 70,000  policemen, who are also trained for combat missions). If we  express the density of military strength in terms of the  quotient of the number of troops and weapons and the state's  area (in square kilometers), we obtain the following value: two  soldiers, 0.22 tanks and armored vehicles, 0.0829 cannons,  rocket launchers, and mortars, and 0.006 aircraft and  helicopters per square kilometer.    For a state that has a per capital national income 10 times  lower than ours, those quotients are sometimes higher than the  European bloc averages, namely approximately four times higher  for the density of troops, almost twice as high for tanks and  armored vehicles, almost four times for aircraft and  helicopters, and almost 13 times for artillery. The  above-mentioned indices--in spite of the obsolescence of the  aircraft equipment--clearly show what kind of military power the  so-called Yugoslavia has become, although its leadership  insistently reiterates that it is not at war, while concealing  the fact that without its logistical support the western Serbian  armies would never have conquered what they did. Last year it  spent approximately 25 to 33 percent of the total GNP to finance  the war and the Serbs west of the Drina. Paramilitary troops and  many experts from the western Serbian armies have likewise been  trained in Serbia.    The process of militarization is also apparent in the  territories west of the Drina; in that zone, the republic of  Srpska [RS] and the republic of Serbian Krajina have a total of  about 150,000 people under arms [one-third of them are RSK  soldiers). If we also take into account the weapons that the  Serbian soldiers have (about 500 tanks and armored personnel  carriers, about 600-800 cannons, long-range missiles, and about  50 aircraft and helicopters), then their military superiority  (over the Croatian and Muslim units, which otherwise total about  190,000 fighters with about 100 tanks and 300 cannons, and whose  main forces are entangled in mutual Croatian-Muslim conflicts)  explains how the numerically inferior western Serbian arms have  succeeded to date in conquering 25 percent of the territory of  Croatia and 70 percent of the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina.  They have thus created the basis for increasing Serbian  territory by 50 percent in the event of a merger with the  so-called FRY.    Since the beginning of the war the Croatian army has made  great qualitative and quantitative progress (it has 150,000  people under arms and about 600 tanks and armored vehicles, and  approximately 800 cannons); in spite of this, if it started the  long-announced decisive, but always postponed offensive (for the  final liberation of its territories)--if all the Serbian armies  merged--it could not achieve the superiority needed for a  successful attack. The Croatian general staff is also aware of  this, and therefore decided on tactical operations with limited  goals ("Miljevac plateau," "Maslenica," and "Divoselo").  <H5>  The New Serbian Doctrine as a Source of Threats </H5>   The former JNA's failures in the wars in Slovenia, Croatia,  and Bosnia-Herzegovina led to the former JNA general staff's  purge of old personnel, and simultaneous formulation of a new  doctrine that takes into account experiences from the Gulf War  (in 1991) and other local wars. They focused their main efforts  on forming an ethnically pure army. The use of paramilitary  forces is an "invention" that allowed the general staff to use  others to carry out the dirty job of "cleansing territories"  (which essentially involves terrorist operations against  civilians with the intention of intimidating the non-Serbian  population into abandoning the territory); they defined  long-range weapons as urgently needed new weapons. Specifically,  they needed a "strategic response" in the event that the  so-called FRY became the target of missile attacks like those  experienced by Iraq (1991) and Libya (1986). In connection with  this, they devoted particular attention to the procurement and  development of long-range surface-to-surface ballistic missiles.  In this regard we should mention that in addition to the threats  from the Radical Seselj, back in 1992 then chief of the General  Staff Zivota Panic also announced the development of a missile  with a range of 1,000 kilometers; he thereby made it clear that  the range of the newly acquired SCUD ballistic missiles (450  kilometers) did not meet the new doctrine's requirements.    From the standpoint of the balance of power, as a particular  threat factor for all of the Balkans and beyond, we should  mention the new Serbian offensive doctrine; it specifically  proves that the threats announced during the past year by the  civilian and military leaders of the western Serbs (for example,  about the bombardment of refineries, urban centers, nuclear  power plants, etc.) were not the brandishing of an empty weapon,  since this year they were actually fulfilled. Even though Gospic  in September 1993 involved a tactical attack by the Croatian  army, in which the Croatian units did not occupy more than 150  square kilometers of the RSK's territory, the Serbs responded  with a merciless bombardment of numerous Croatian towns (the  vicinity of Zagreb, Samobor, which lies along the Slovene  border, Sibenik, Zadar, and Karlovac), and industrial facilities  (the Sisak refinery, and the Kutina artificial fertilizer  factory), and they also fired--for the time being only in  warning--surface-to-surface missiles (specifically, in the  immediate vicinity of Zagreb). The doctrine of Serbian deep  strikes against urban centers, accompanied by assaults by  Serbian special units deep behind enemy lines, indicates that if  there is a renewed escalation of conflicts, the Serbian armies  will not limit themselves only to a tactical defense, but will  instead respond with the already announced strikes against the  entire depth of the territory within the range of their weapons.  Consequently, towns still remain the main targets (they are  treating Vukovar, Osijek, Dubrovnik, and Karlovac as paradigms  for the future). In this regard, they are seriously counting on  support by "volunteers" from the so-called Yugoslavia, which  will only be a camouflage for the use of regular units from the  so-called FRY. [passage omitted]    Taking into account the fact that the chief of the so-called  FRY's General Staff visited Iraq last year precisely because of  Iraq's experiences, and that there are many indirect indications  that the army of the so-called FRY has succeeded--in spite of  the embargo--in obtaining long-range weapons, last year's  threats by Serbian generals about attacks against all targets  within range of their weapons should be taken seriously, and  appropriate defensive countermeasures should be sought in time,  or else we would be risking what the surprised victims of the  Iraqi and Libyan attacks experienced.    In connection with this, we should recall that this year's  list of 30 civilian targets that RSK General Novakovic announced  "urbi et orbi" to the Croatian public also included Pulj; in  view of the distribution of Serbian positions, this means that  in Slovenia, the Serbian weapons could reach targets up to the  Radovljica-Sezana line. Furthermore, we should recall that in  neighboring Croatia, just as previously in Italy (in 1986) and  Israel (1991), before last September's events occurred, they  were assessed from a professional standpoint as not very likely  or unlikely, but they nevertheless happened.</p>

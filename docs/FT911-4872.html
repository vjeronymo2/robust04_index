			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Israel defies US by starting new settlement ISRAELI settlers yesterday began moving into the first Jewish settlement to be established in the occupied West Bank for two years in direct defiance of US warnings that such actions could jeopardise its efforts to broker a Middle East peace accord. The government-financed settlers said they had deliberately moved forward plans to occupy the settlement - originally given official approval as a settlement site eight years ago - to take place before Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state, returns to Israel later this week to pursue proposals for Arab-Israeli peace negotiations. Last night the White House said the settlement was an obstacle to the peace process. More than a dozen mobile homes, acquired through the Housing Ministry run by Mr Ariel Sharon, a vocal opponent of Mr Baker's peace proposals, were transported overnight to the settlement site, called Revava, where several families prepared to move in immediately. The settlers fear peace talks could undermine Israeli rule over the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Ministers in the government of Mr Yitzhak Shamir, which supports settlement and has rejected Washington's view that they are an obstacle to peace, refused to distance themselves from yesterday's move. Mr Shamir says there is no link between settlements and the peace process. In London yesterday, Mr Shamir likened the Israeli settlers in the territories to Arab residents of Israel proper and said it was normal for people to build houses. 'It doesn't make any difference if there will be in these disputed territories 100 settlements or 120 settlements,' he told a news conference. 'The permanent political solution will be accepted outside this fact.' Mr Shamir yesterday met Mr Valentin Pavlov, the Soviet prime minister, in a sign of the improving relations between the two countries. But the Israeli premier was unable to say if the Soviet Union would agree to Israel's demand that full diplomatic ties be restored if Moscow wishes to join Washington in supervising a proposed regional Middle East peace conference. 'It is absolutely necessary that before a meeting the Soviet Union will establish with Israel normal diplomatic relations. . . Mr Pavlov told me that they will think about it and consider it.' In Israel, Mr Ehud Olmert, the health minister, said he agreed the establishment of Revava was awkwardly timed, but added: 'On the other hand, if indeed settlements are a vital component of government policy, it is better not to play hide and seek.' This attitude infuriates the Palestinians, who told Mr Baker last week that they could not take the proposition of peace talks with Israel seriously as long as settlement continued. Some 100,000 Jews now live in the West Bank and Gaza, a figure that rose by about 10 per cent last year. Israeli opposition groups also bitterly condemned the new settlement. '(Revava) is a provocation against the peace process and it is meant to deter any Arab who wants to talk peace with Israel today. . . and to lead us to the next war,' said Mr Ran Cohen, Citizens Rights Movement MP.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Reckless Sex"] </F>   [Text] Reckless driving in an automobile is punishable by  law, regardless of whether or not anyone is hurt. Wanton actions  or thoughtlessness that put other people's lives or health in  danger are punishable. Thus, one might believe that reckless sex  would also be a criminal offense. But such is not the case. With  its verdict yesterday, the Supreme Court decided that if an  HIV-infected person performs unsafe sex without informing his  partner of the risk, knowing full well that there is a danger of  a lethal outcome of the act, then it is not a punishable offense.    The Supreme Court's verdict was immediately faxed to Arhus,  where the Western High Court was trying another case involving  an HIV-infected woman who stood accused of having unsafe sex  without informing her partner. In accordance with the decision  of the Supreme Court, the woman was soon able to leave the  Western High Court after being acquitted.    This puts the matter back in the hands of Folketing. The  Folketing has been under the impression that the deliberate  spread of infection was covered by existing paragraphs in the  penal code. But now the Supreme Court has indicated that the law  does not provide such clear authority. The Folketing must now do  something about this. Of course, we must not start a witch-hunt  against HIV-infected persons, but those who are infected must  recognize their personal responsibility, which is a consequence  of the fact that they are a potential danger.    The entire AIDS system, with its built-in oath of silence  and  anonymity, is presently based on voluntarism and trust. But when  we see examples of flagrant irresponsibility, as illustrated in  the extreme by the case before the Supreme Court, we cannot help  but think that the system must be changed. One's own misery is  not lessened by sharing it with others. Particularly considering  that AIDS must presently be seen as incurable, it should be a  crime for a person who knows he is HIV-positive to fail to  inform his partner of the danger.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa by Nasir Farghali </F> in London; date not given; from the "Face to Face" program --  recorded]    [Text] [Farghali] The incident that is still on the minds  of the Arab public since all of us watched the signing of the  Cairo agreement on 4 May took place on the stage of the  Conference Hall in Cairo. Can you tell us what happened, since  you were a principal player in it?    [Musa] We were not involved in what happened on the day of  the signing. It was between Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] and  Yitzhaq Rabin. It concerned clarification about some matters  related to the maps of Jericho and Gaza, specifically Jericho.  The size agreed on was not final. In other words, the  agreement on it was not as it had been decided on early that  morning after a long night of discussions that continued in  President Mubarak's office until 0300. We agreed that there  would be a letter recording that the size was not final and that  negotiations would continue to define the size of the Jericho  area. That letter was not appended to the map. Abu-'Ammar  hesitated when he was about to sign until he saw the letter and  then he signed.    [Farghali] Coincidentally, I was covering the event for MBC  on that day. We all saw Abu-'Ammar write something down.    [Musa] He was referring to the letter.    [Farghali] What happened when you withdrew from the stage  for  some minutes?    [Musa] Abu-'Ammar wanted to see the letter. President  Mubarak also wanted to see it. We wanted to be sure that the  letter existed. When we ascertained this, Abu-'Ammar returned  to sign. It was not a question of whether Abu-'Ammar wanted to  sign or not. We wanted to see the letter. The discussions  ended at 0300 and we were all tired and could have missed  something. This is why we all wanted to be sure before  Abu-'Ammar signed. When I say we all, I mean Palestine and  Egypt. We wanted to be sure that this letter existed.    [Farghali] Among the Palestinians there are reservations  about and fears from the peace process and from what is  happening on the Palestinian-Israeli track. I believe that  Egypt has a major responsibility here because it has been its  fate to play this great role.    [Musa] The fears will remain. We understand this because we,  too, had some fears during the Camp David talks. We asked  ourselves: Will the Israeli side fulfill its commitments? Will  the issue end as we want? Will we retrieve all the territories  when there are talks about stages? The important thing is how  Abu-'Ammar and the Palestinians manage their own affairs and  tackle the problems that will arise. There will be many  problems, but there is no other way. The issue now is the quick  retrieval of the land. The problem of Israeli settlements will  become less the quicker we are in retrieving the land. Had the  Palestinian side worked with us when we were having the Camp  David negotiations with Israel, it would have most certainly  reached a better agreement. Why? Because the number of  settlements and settlers was much less then. Instead of dealing  with 120,000 settlers, the Palestinian side would have dealt  with 8,000 settlers and with 10 or a small number of settlements  instead of 180. That exacerbated the situation. The more we  waited, the more Palestinian lands were lost. The Palestinians  have now started on the right track, namely that of obtaining  the land and starting to build an entity and a Palestinian  authority with its own identity and a large measure of  independence. Of course, all of us on the Arab side should  realize that the Oslo agreement on Gaza and Jericho first--which  was signed in Washington and on which negotiations continued  until its document of implementation was signed in Cairo--is the  first step. The Palestinian state has not been established.  The right to self-determination has not been exercised yet.  The Israeli withdrawal from all the occupied territories has  not been done yet. Self-rule in all the occupied territories  has not been achieved yet. These are the facts and there is no  need for oneupmanship or criticism. Why? Because we, and  specifically the Palestinians, are not starting from zero but  from below zero. For the Palestinians, what is needed are not  slogans, shouts, or oneupmanship. Whoever has more to give than  Abu-'Ammar, let him come forward and show us. Let him say: I  can bring you such and such things. I say very frankly that we  believe that criticism for its own sake and hoping that the 21st  or 22nd Century might bring a solution are shallow words. Do  what you can do. Take your land. Achieve the first Israeli  withdrawal from the Palestinian territories occupied after 1967.  The more we stay without improving the situation, the more lands  are lost. Oneupmanship and too much talk do not bring any  results.    [Farghali] We opened this subject because, as you know,  many people do not have the full picture. You certainly  clarified some very important matters for us. It is being said,  for instance, that the Egyptian leadership is putting pressure  on Abu-'Ammar personally to sign....    [Musa, interrupting] There is absolutely no Egyptian  pressure. We fully realize the delicate nature of this stage as  well as Arab sensitivities. What Egypt is doing is to help the  Palestinians, as I have already told you. Take the example you  mentioned regarding the signing ceremony on the stage.  President Mubarak's concern, like that of president 'Arafat,  was to be sure that a letter really existed. So there was no  reproach or blame on our part. Our feeling was: Well, he is  right. Let him be sure about every point before he signs. The  Palestinian side is the weak side in the negotiations, because  as I told you they started from below zero. The Israeli side is  stronger because it has the land, the power, and several  international circles backing it. The Egyptian role sought to  give adequate strength to the Palestinians to be stronger  against the Israelis. There were several points that on many  occasions we said we could not accept and would reject, even if  the Palestinians accepted them. Why? Because there are certain  issues that we can never waive. We support the Palestinians in  regaining their land. We do not push the Palestinians to make a  specific decision. Absolutely not. The decision rests with  Abu-'Ammar, the PLO Central Committee, and the Palestinian  leadership. If they ask for our opinion, we give it to them,  and it is not binding. If our assistance is requested, we  assist. If we are not asked to give our opinion or if our  assistance is not requested, we do not interfere.    [Farghali] In view of the current Palestinian circumstances  you have mentioned, the Egyptian role becomes inevitable.  However, things are different on the Syrian track. What is the  nature of or prospects for the Egyptian role along that track?    [Musa] As you said, The Syrian issue or track is different.  This is because there are more markers on this track than on the  Palestinian track. For instance, there are Syrian international  borders that can never be ignored. The same applies to Lebanon,  which is a separate track. The Egyptian role here proceeds from  the same policy and philosophy governing the subject. If our  help is requested, we are ready to give it. If our opinion is  sought, we are ready to give it. But Egypt does not volunteer  to get involved in any of the Arab-Israeli negotiations unless  the parties themselves ask us to help.    [Farghali] You will give a lecture here in London on the  Middle East and regional policies. Many people wonder what is  really being negotiated on the Syrian track. As you have  stated, the international borders are known and there are  several signals from Israel that the Golan will be returned to  Syria. The problem of the settlements on the Golan is not as  complicated as it is in other occupied Arab territories. But  some say that the negotiations are actually about the situation  in that area after a certain Israeli-Syrian settlement is  reached. Is this true?    [Musa] No, it is not. What is happening is negotiations  about the withdrawal, the future relations between Syria and  Israel, and the security measures. That is all.    [Farghali] Do you foresee progress on the Israeli-Lebanese  track?    [Musa] The Israeli-Lebanese track is very clear. Even under  the Likud government the former prime minister declared that  Israel has no territorial designs on Lebanon. Moreover, UN  Security Council Resolution 425 is clear regarding the subject  of withdrawal, in addition to other UN resolutions on the Middle  East. The issue between Israel and Lebanon is not over  territory but over how to achieve joint or mutual security and  avert military clashes in southern Lebanon. There are certain  political conditions in the region that link the Lebanese track  to the Syrian track. However, it is clear to all that the  Lebanese track is independent in all its aspects.    [Farghali] Another crisis has surfaced recently, namely the  Yemeni crisis. You have repeatedly explained Egypt's stance on  this situation. Egypt has always had a historic role in Yemen.  How is Egypt dealing with the current crisis?    [Musa] Our efforts are based on mediation and calming  matters between the two sides. Yesterday President Mubarak  received the Yemeni foreign minister. Before that he received  envoys from the two sides in Yemen. We want to make it clear  that the current military operations between the south and the  north have opened the gates of hell. In other words, matters  will not end well. Unity must be based on dialogue. Up to this  moment the two sides have not spoken about secession. Unity  must be maintained. Even if there are differences, there are  ways to settle them. This is what we are trying to explain. An  Egyptian envoy went to Yemen and stayed several days there to  study the situation and attempt to calm matters. Many efforts  were intended to support the unity but resulted in supporting a  clash between the two sides and in the loss of confidence  between many officials in the north and the south. All this has  made the situation in Yemen very serious, which requires  constant and effective intervention. This is what we are doing  as best we can. That is why we asked for a meeting of the Arab  League. We said the Arab League should not remain indifferent  to this dispute. We said the subject must be discussed by the  Arab League. The subject was discussed by the Arab League; the  meeting has been suspended but has not ended. The problem in  Yemen will affect the Arab world from both a geographic and a  political point of view. The final say is for the Yemeni  people. It is not for us or for anyone else to impose unity or  secession. They united, they must preserve this unity.  Anything that deepens the secession, causes bloodshed, and  creates loss of confidence is a bad indication for Yemen and the  Yemenis. We hope they will succeed in establishing a quick  dialogue and in turning this page that has spawned clashes,  bloodshed, and martyrs on both sides. This is one country.  They are, after all, Arabs. No side can claim victory over the  other side because this is not victory. Ultimately, matters  will not end like this.    [Farghali] It is said that Egypt wanted to dispatch forces  to help disengage the warring forces in Yemen.    [Musa] No, no. This is not true. What happened is that one  of the ideas proposed was that if there was any need for Arab,  not Egyptian, peacekeeping forces the matter could have been  considered by the Arab League. But the issue depends on Arab  League approval and the acceptance of Yemen. However, the  current circumstances are not suitable for that.    [Farghali] Egyptian troops have taken part in the UN  missions  in Somalia and Bosnia. Do you think this role will be promoted,  particularly since the United Nations is headed by Dr. Butrus  Butrus-Ghali? Will this role expand. How does the Egyptian  leadership view this role?    [Musa] This is all contingent on the UN Security Council's  resolutions and not on the secretary general or his nationality.  It depends on two matters. If the Security Council decides to  send UN troops to disputed areas, it will contact many  countries, and perhaps all countries. The Security Council will  ask them: Do you wish to participate in this work? It also  depends on the state's decision whether to participate.    We participated in Mozambique, Western Sahara, Burundi,  Somalia, Bosnia, and Cambodia. We did not only send troops but  observers. Some of our involvement was done on the request from  the United Nations and the appeal from the Organization of  African Unity. Our decision to participate in the peacekeeping  process was basically made for African considerations. However,  there are two factors governing the participation of troops.  There is the UN Security Council decision to establish a  peacekeeping process in certain areas. This is usually followed  by UN contacts with all the member states to ask whether they  wish to participate in this process. It is also our decision  whether to participate or not. We refused to participate in  certain areas. We did participate in Somalia and Bosnia because  these are extremely important issues. We decided to do so  because this was incumbent upon us to participate in sending  troops.    [Farghali] Western countries are facing problems in  providing  troops that are requested by the United Nations to implement its  resolutions. Sending U.S. troops to Bosnia might take time and  require negotiations. Perhaps this issue will never be solved.  It seems that the Egyptian participation is almost guaranteed  and will be relied upon by the UN secretary general.    [Musa] The Egyptian participation is more relied upon than  guaranteed. This is because the issue depends on the Security  Council decision and the decision of the state whether to send  troops. As I said, we focus on Africa more than any other  place. But the issue of Bosnia is important as far as we are  concerned. Hence, the Egyptian force was sent right from the  start. But there are other countries that have troops in Bosnia  and other places. Turkey, for example, has troops in Bosnia and  other areas as well. There are also small countries that  participate in peacekeeping processes. We will participate and  we will help Butrus-Butrus Ghali in this matter. We will help  and will continue to participate in the peacekeeping process.    [Farghali] What about the Egyptian moves concerning ties  with  the Arab Gulf states and the security strategy in the region  within the context of the new world order? What is the nature  of the Egyptian moves?    [Musa] The pan-Arab security issue is under discussion. I  prefer not to elaborate on it now because it is a complex issue  linked with many political circumstances and developments in the  region. Therefore, talking about this issue in a minute or two  would harm it. Please accept my apology. However, I would like  to tell you that this issue is extremely important and was  included in the Arab League agenda on Egypt's request in  September 1991.    [Farghali] Thank you, Your Excellency.    [Musa] You are welcome.</p>

			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / International Company News: Chinese steel group in HKDollars 3.9bn share offer MAANSHAN Iron and Steel has become the largest Chinese state company to issue shares in Hong Kong, following the launch of its HKDollars 3.93bn (USDollars 508m) share offer. Around 75 per cent of these shares have been taken up through private placement, and analysts expect a strong response to the public offer. Maanshan is the fifth of the nine Chinese state companies short-listed for flotation in Hong Kong, and it will be the largest. The company is forecast to post net profit of Yn1.25bn (about HKDollars 1.08bn) in 1993, representing a 207 per cent increase from 1992, as a result of lower taxation and the benefits of the lifting of state controls on pricing. The company is the eighth largest iron and steel company in China, and is situated to the west of Shanghai. It has been rapidly expanding its production capacity, in the face of the highest growth in demand among the world's main iron consuming economies. Given the vast requirement for infra-structural expansion in China, Chinese steel demand is forecast to continue to outpace domestic supply. The company is using the proceeds from the flotation to fund expansion of its iron smelting facilities, and to boost steel rolling capacity. It also intends to introduce new products, such as H-section steel bars, required for construction of high-rise buildings. The company is offering 1.73bn shares at HKDollars 2.27 a share. Dealing in the share will commence on November 3.</p>

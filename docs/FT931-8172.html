			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Letter: Unfounded maternity leave fears Sir, The chance of a woman demanding maternity leave the day after the start of a new job is remote, so it is curious of the Confederation of British Industry's Mr Gilbert to focus on it ('Maternity changes nurture fears', February 15). He is probably expressing the fear, still found among some employers, of the burden that employment rights for working women represents. If so, he should be reassured that similar fears expressed by employers about the introduction of maternity rights in the 1970s turned out to be groundless. Research demonstrates that maternity leave is only one of the many sources of absence and much less common than most. Increasingly, employers are seeing the benefits of providing adequate maternity leave in terms of retaining valued staff. In any event, much of the cost, in terms of pay, is borne by the state. While regretting the complexity of the Trade Union Reform and Employment Rights Bill, the Maternity Alliance welcomes the proposed extension of maternity leave to the minority of women not currently entitled to any. It is reassuring to note that the CBI is not abandoning its commitment to equal opportunities policies. Women should not suffer disproportionately the effects of this recession.

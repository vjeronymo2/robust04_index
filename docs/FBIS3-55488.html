In this connection, Aleksandre Kavsadze, chairman of  the Georgian committee for inter-ethnic relations and human  rights, has stated that Georgia is opposed to the examination of  the future state system of Abkhazia at the Geneva talks. He  said that the state system of Abkhazia is Georgia's internal  problem and that it is now being examined by the republic's  Constitutional Commission.    Mr. Kavsadze believes that the subject of the Geneva talks  should be the future of the Georgian refugees who left Abkhazia  last year.</p>

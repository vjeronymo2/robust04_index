			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Hornby hit by video games invasion THE INVASION of the high street by video games and just-in-time stocking by retailers left Hornby, the hobby and sports boat manufacturer, with first-half 1993 pre-tax losses of Pounds 791,000 compared with profits of Pounds 158,000. Mr Malcolm Thomas, the new chairman, said the downturn was also due to the weakness of sterling increasing import costs. Sales of video games continued to take cash away from traditional toys and retailers had continued to place orders for immediate needs only. But the company is confident about the full year. Mr Thomas said the current order position was satisfactory and the value of orders received so far represented a similar percentage of total planned sales compared with the corresponding time last year. He said the new Gladiator range, based on the television series, had achieved wide distribution and was well received by customers. Turnover fell to Pounds 8.12m (Pounds 11.5m). Mr Thomas said a change in the time of new product releases and the later pattern of customer ordering had accentuated the seasonal profile of sales, which are usually biased towards the second half. Interest charges fell to Pounds 16,000 (Pounds 58,000). Cash flow was stronger, resulting from a lower volume of imports, tight controls on capital expenditure, and lower base rates in the period. Net borrowings were Pounds 2m (Pounds 5.7m). Losses per share were 5.9p compared with profits of 1.2p last time. Hornby does not declare an interim dividend.</p>

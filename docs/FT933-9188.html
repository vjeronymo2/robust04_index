			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / Pounds 6m Shropshire farmland bought THE Lands Improvement Group, an agricultural property company, has bought 6,746 acres of Shropshire farmland for about Pounds 6m. The deal is one of the largest acquisitions of let farmland in recent years. The North Shropshire Estate at Ellesmere includes 24 tenanted farms and 14 cottages and smallholdings. The land, which yields about 5 per cent, is being sold by the Mercantile and General Reinsurance Company, a subsidiary of the Prudential Corporation. The Land Improvement Group, owned by a group of City institutions, holds about 25,000 acres of rural land. Mr Peter Clery, managing director, said that the company would give certain tenants an opportunity to buy their farms, although it wished to retain at least 2,000 acres, and would provide mortgage finance in some cases.</p>

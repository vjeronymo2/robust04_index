			<p><P> August 9, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: DANCE  </P> <P> The Bolshoi by any other spelling is still the Bolshoi. So the Bolshoi Theatre  and its Western representative, the Entertainment Corp., have obtained an  injunction in London against the "Bolschoi on Ice" tour scheduled for the  United Kingdom and the United States later this year. An Entertainment Corp.  executive said that "putting a c in the name makes no difference. . . .  Bolshoi, however it may be spelt, is allied to one of the world's greatest  ballet and opera companies" and has been misappropriated by the 3-year-old ice  show. The Bolshoi Ballet, currently selling out at London's Coliseum and due to  tour the U.S. next year, has no connection with the ice show. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Major rejects criticism over ERM MR JOHN MAJOR, the prime minister, gave a further assurance in the Commons yesterday that there was nothing in the Maastricht treaty obliging Britain to rejoin the European exchange rate mechanism, Ivor Owen writes. He rejected a suggestion by Sir Peter Tapsell (C East Lindsey), a prominent opponent of the treaty, that at an earlier stage he had been advised that the provision entitling Britain to opt out from monetary union did not extend to the exchange rate mechanism. Stressing that he had not been given any fresh advice, the prime minister insisted that it had always been the case that the treaty did not require Britain to rejoin the exchange rate mechanism. Mr Major said the treaty made clear that the UK government retained responsibility for monetary policy in stages two and three of economic and monetary union so long as it did not participate in a single monetary policy. Mr Major said the government would not 'enter into a single currency unless and until this House has explicitly approved it'.</p>

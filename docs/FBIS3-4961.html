The United States has criticized Japan's automotive  standards  and certification system as an import barrier, and called for an  immediate removal of the barrier.    The officials said there are two methods of certification  for  foreign cars -- one method being a one-by-one certification of  imported autos and the other a blanket certification of imported  autos of the same type.    If a foreign automaker is to ensure blanket certification,  it  will have to file with the ministry for designation of autos of  the same type, the officials said.    If a foreign automaker wins type designation for a certain  type of auto, the cost of bringing such autos into Japan is  lower and the formalities involved are much simpler, they said.    Thus, most of the autos imported from Europe are covered by  the type designation system, while most of the U.S. automakers  have not utilized the system.    The ministry is sending Hideaki Mukaiyama, vice minister for  international affairs, to Detroit next Tuesday to encourage U.S.  automakers to utilize the system.    The ministry is due to station a consul at the Japanese  Consulate General in Detroit from April to help U.S. automakers  win type designation for their autos.</p>

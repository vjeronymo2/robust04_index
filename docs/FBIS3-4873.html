They exchanged views on Japan-U.S.  relations following the breakdown of the economic framework  talks.    At the meeting, Ambassador Kuriyama pointed out that the  economic talks were broken off because both Japan and the United  States distrusted each other. With regard to the large tax  reductions with which President Clinton professed  dissatisfaction during the recent Japan-U.S. summit, the  ambassador stated in an effort to dispel U.S. misunderstandings:  "The tax cuts are not limited to one year." Moreover,  Ambassador Kuriyama briefed them about Japan's voluntary  market-opening measures centering on deregulation--which the  Hosokawa cabinet is currently promoting--and sought U.S.  understanding.    On the other hand, U.S. Congressmen who attended the meeting  professed dissatisfaction with the closed nature of the Japanese  market and stated their opinions regarding the lack of mutual  trust between the two countries as well as other issues. They  expressed concern that if the Japanese and U.S. Governments do  not mend the current rift between them at an early date, the  atmosphere in Congress against Japan will grow worse.</p>

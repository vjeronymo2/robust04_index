			<p><P> December 12, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK;  </P> <P> WORKER COUNSELING PROGRAM HONORED  </P> <P> If Buena Park employees need help with marital, family, alcohol or drug  problems, or managing stress, they don't have to go far for help.  </P> <P> Thanks to Larry Temple, director of administrative services, city employees  have the benefit of a full-time psychologist 24 hours a day.  </P> <P> The city's Employees Assistance Program is one of only a few such plans in the  county, and Rutgers University has chosen it as one of 25 programs nationwide  to be honored for innovation and success.  </P> <P> Temple and Dr. Tom Abbott, city psychologist, recently went to Rutgers to  accept an award on behalf of the city.  </P> <P> The program, begun in 1987, was a vision Temple had while working on the city  police force in 1978.  </P> <P> "I saw the need," Temple said, referring to delayed stress syndrome, which is  largely associated with police and fire department jobs. "It wasn't uncommon  for a 35-year-old man to become an alcoholic, and lose everything because of  the stress from the job."  </P> <P> Abbott initially worked only with police officers, but the program caught on  quickly and the city soon began to see a decline in early retirements and  disability leaves.  </P> <P> Temple was promoted to director of administration in 1987 and shortly  thereafter began working on creating a program for all city employees and their  families.  </P> <P> "What we wanted to achieve was a way to help employees continue to do their  jobs at a satisfactory level during periods of personal difficulties," Temple  said.  </P> <P> The city has saved money through the program, Temple said.  </P> <P> "For every $1 you spend on EAP, you get $4 back in hard dollars by reductions  in absenteeism, utilization of health care, and disability retirements," he  said.  </P> <P> "If a 30-year-old police officer goes on disability retirement, the total  long-range cost is estimated at $785,000," Temple said. "That's how much is  saved every time such a retirement is prevented."  </P> <P> Abbott, 47, a marriage, family and child therapist, says he is no stranger to  the stress encountered by others. A recovering alcoholic, he decided to get  into therapy himself, and from there has continually tried to help others.  </P> <P> "My background gives me a level of understanding," he said.  </P> <P> Abbott noted that one of the most successful factors of the program is the  confidentiality.  </P> <P> "We don't keep individual case records, only a number count, without names," he  said.  </P> <P> He said marital issues have been the most frequent reason for counseling,  followed by emotional stress and parent-child problems.

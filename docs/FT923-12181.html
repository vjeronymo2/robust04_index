			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / Lords rule on right of silence DEFENDANTS in fraud cases can no longer automatically use their right to silence to avoid answering questions in civil proceedings, the House of Lords ruled yesterday. The judgment is likely to make it considerably easier for liquidators and other investigators to track down and recover missing funds in future fraud cases. Giving judgment in the case of AT&amp;T Istel v Mr Arthur Tully, five law lords ruled by four to one that a Court of Appeal decision restoring Mr Tully's right to silence should be overturned. Mr Tully had originally successfully challenged a High Court ruling that he should provide details of transactions and assets to victims of his alleged fraud. Lord Templeman yesterday described the use of the right to silence in civil proceedings as 'an archaic and unjustifiable survival from the past'. He said: 'It is difficult to see any reason why in civil proceedings the privilege against self-incrimination should be exerciseable so as to enable a litigant to refuse relevant and even vital documents which are in his possession or power and which speak for themselves. 'The Court of Appeal reached their decision with regret because they clearly saw Mr Tully is seeking to exploit the privilege against self-incrimination in order to frustrate the plaintiff's claims.' The Crown Prosecution Service had stated that it would not seek to use any information given by Mr Tully to other parties in civil proceedings. 'There is no reason why the privilege should be blatantly exploited to deprive the plaintiffs of their civil rights and remedies if the privilege is not necessary to protect Mr Tully,' Lord Templeman continued. A recent use of the right to silence to prevent self-incrimination was the refusal by Mr Kevin Maxwell and Mr Ian Maxwell to give evidence to the House of Commons social security committee investigating the Maxwell affair. Although not directly applicable to the work of commons committees, the ruling may ease the task of the social security committee in its future investigations into the disappearance of the Maxwell pension funds. The committee is likely to interview some of those who held key roles in the Maxwell organisation, including Mr Michael Stoney, the former finance director of Mirror Group Newspapers, who earlier refused to answer the committee's questions, and Mr Robert Bunn, the former finance director of the Maxwell private companies.</p>

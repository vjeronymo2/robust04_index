This statement was made in an interview  with Interfax-Ukraine, by the co-chairman of the inter-regional  bloc of reforms, Leonid Kuchma.    He was elected on March 27 to be people's deputy of Ukraine,  winning in his constituency 91 percent of the votes.    Kuchma believes that the legal basis was virtually destroyed  in economics. He criticized the activities of the government  which in December 1993 freed prices and restricted credits.  According to the former prime minister, this has caused the  debt crisis and the stoppage of enterprises.    He still believes that the president should be the head of  the executive power. He disagrees that the heads of the local  councils be granted executive powers.    "On this I agree with Kravchuk. If so, we will really have  26 presidents in 26 regions," said Kuchma.    He spoke against rescheduling the presidential elections for  a later date. There are no grounds for that, he said.    Speaking about the problem of relations between the Crimea  and Ukraine, Kuchma said that pressure on Crimea will produce no  results.    Crimea should be a starting point for reforms in Ukraine,  said Kuchma.</p>

			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Observer: Boxing clever First it's gnomes, now it's coffins. Naughty Poland - whose garden gnomes were recently forbidden entry to Germany - is now exporting too many coffins. Germany's coffin-makers are even less happy than normal. The Germans complain that the quality of the Polish boxes is not up to German standards; they used the same complaint to stop an invasion of Polish gnomes. The fact that Polish coffins may be cheaper has obviously impressed consumers - who spend DM12bn a year on the paraphernalia of death - but the coffin-makers, like countless other producers in Germany, seem not to have noticed.</p>

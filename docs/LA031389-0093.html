			<p><P> March 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> PROMISING CONDUCTIVITY WORK  </P> <P> The creation of three new superconducting ceramics suggests that a whole new  class of materials could overcome some of the problems associated with finding  the perfect electrical conductor, a UC San Diego physicist said last week.  Unlike more conventional superconducting metals that transmit current through  so-called "electron holes," the new ceramics use extra electrons to carry  electrical current, said M. Brian Maple.  </P> <P> The new materials could be a precursor to superconductors -- materials that  carry electricity with no losses due to resistance -- that operate at higher  temperatures and do not need costly coolants, said Maple. His team is the first  in the United States to make the new ceramics. The new materials could  "overcome some of the problems associated with previously known  superconductors, such as low amounts of electrical current. Materials  discovered within this category may be able to carry more current than existing  materials," he added.  </P> <P> The new materials involve combinations of copper oxide with rare earth elements  such as praseodymium, neodymium or europium and small amounts of either cerium  or thorium.  </P></p>

			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / International Company News: Rivals buy Steinberg food chain for CDollars 275m THE 75-year-old Steinberg food chain, a former North American leader in automated warehousing and manufacture, is about to disappear from eastern Canada. Steinberg, opened in Montreal by Ida Steinberg, a Polish immigrant, in 1917, is being taken over by its rivals Provigo and Metro-Richelieu, for CDollars 275m (USDollars 231m). This amount is barely enough to repay bank debt and suppliers. Steinberg was once the leader in Quebec. It expanded into Ontario and the Maritimes and diversified into general merchandising. Then Ida's eldest son, Sam, main architect of the company's phenomenal post-war growth, died. Soon afterwards, less purposeful management allowed competitors to gain ground and the 1982-1983 recession dealt Steinberg a severe blow. The Steinberg family sold control for about CDollars 1bn in 1989, the real estate going to the Caisse de Depot, the Quebec Pension Plan's investment arm, for about CDollars 800m. The supermarkets and warehouses went to the Montreal entrepreneur Mr Michel Gaucher. However, the latest recession, price wars, and Quebec's heavy unemployment has finally caught up with Mr Gaucher. He has sold most of the remaining 115 supermarkets to the two competitors, with the Caisse's blessing. The Steinberg name will soon be gone. Loblaw of Toronto, Canada's biggest food distributor, made an unsuccessful bid for Steinberg in 1989 and tried again this year. Many Steinberg employees, fearing further rationalisation, preferred Loblaw, but its bid was refused.</p>

			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / People: Horne enters his third age with relish David Horne, who stepped down as chairman of Lloyds Merchant Bank in December, is looking forward to 'the great third period of one's life' as he picks up a clutch of non-executive directorships. Horne, 61, is joining the board of Serif, the security and specialist commercial printer which once distributed the board game Trivial Pursuits, and office furniture and leasing group Black Arrow. 'I am more interested in smaller companies where I might have something to add' he remarks. He is a director of consulting engineer Waterman Partnership, and thinks he has time for a fourth position. During his time at Lloyds, Horne was involved in three high-profile ventures  -advising the unsuccessful European consortium during the Westland affair, as well as Lloyds' failed bids for Standard Chartered and Midland. He also became acquainted with Serif, which the bank advised during its reversal into Cowells. Alongside Horne, Serif is adding another non-executive director to advise on its expanding security printing operations. He is Richard Harrison, 56, who is vice chairman of PIRA International, a research organisation for the printing, publishing and packaging industries. It is also a corporate finance connection that binds Horne to Black Arrow; when at Williams &amp; Glyn's earlier in his career, he advised the company which reversed into Blanes in 1974. He joins as the third non-executive, and the first to be appointed in twenty years. Horne will on familiar territory. Not only is Derek Moore, one of the other non-executives, a former Williams &amp; Glyn's man himself, but the board also shares a strong interest in golf. Horne has captained St George's Hill, deputy chairman Maurice Edward Coombe Hill and Moore, The Dyke in Sussex.</p>

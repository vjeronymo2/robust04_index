The life of  some 39 people announced a hunger strike for the future of the  country is endangering. [sentence as received] Joining in the  political struggle for justice by a leader of the MSDP and MP  [member of parliament] R. Gonchigdorj is an unprecedented event  not ever met before in the states of democracy.    The responsibility for the aftermath of the present crisis,  the statement says, lies in the Great State Hural and government.</p>

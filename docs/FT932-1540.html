			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Depth of Ferruzzi debt to foreign banks revealed by minister FERRUZZI, the diversified Italian industrial group, owes foreign banks L6,500bn (Pounds 2.86bn), Mr Piero Barucci, treasury minister, told a parliamentary committee in Rome yesterday. Mr Barucci warned of the dangers to Italy's credibility in international financial markets if the crisis at the company were allowed to reach the proportions of last summer's collapse of the Efim state holding company, with total debts of more than L15,000bn. Ferruzzi is one of Italy's most international companies and Mr Barucci said about 110 foreign banks had lent to the group. Bankers in Milan suggested the biggest exposure could be among French institutions. The group controls French-based Eridania Beghin-Say, the agro-industrial concern formed in 1991-92 from the merger of Italy's Eridania with Beghin-Say, the French agro-industrial company indirectly controlled by Ferruzzi. The spread of Ferruzzi's operations and its voracious financing needs imply many other leading international banks might have been big lenders. Mr Barucci sought to calm fears in parliament that the problems at Ferruzzi, which this month disclosed total group borrowings approaching L31,000bn, implied a collapse. 'Ferruzzi is Italy's second biggest conglomerate and its activities touch on strategic areas for the country. It is therefore urgent to intervene now just in the group's own interest, but especially to avoid any risk to the credibility of Italy as a whole,' he said. Stock in the Ferruzzi Finanziaria holding company plunged more than 12 per cent to L559. Montedison shares fell 2.24 per cent to L874. Mr Pier Carlo Marengo, managing director of Credito Italiano, said his bank's exposure was about L1,300bn, AP-DJ reports. In spite of the scale of Ferruzzi's difficulties he was optimistic about the outcome of the situation. He said although Ferruzzi hoped to keep control of Eridinia Beghin-Say, 'everything else is up for sale'.</p>

			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Survey of Northern Greece (1): Efficient yet unsure of itself - Although a third of the country's manufacturing originates in the north, where businesses show a higher return on capital, the people of the region feel that prosperity has been achieved in spite of centralised government policies ALONG WITH democracy and much else besides, the Greeks invented the idea of a north-south divide. The ancient Athenian orator Demosthenes, for one, made a career out of criticising the Macedonians of northern Greece as aggressive and uncivilised outsiders. The modern inhabitants of Epirus, Macedonia and Thrace, the three northern Greek provinces, certainly consider themselves political outsiders, though in economic terms they have caught up with, and in some areas - such as central Macedonia - overtaken, the rest of the country. While overall annual growth in Greece in the 1980s averaged only 1.7 per cent, the rate for northern Greece was 2.3 per cent. Epirus, a mountainous province with the country's highest emigration rate in the 1960s, has started to develop its own tourist industry and to export traditional products - wine, cheese and marble. Thessaloniki claims to have a higher per capita income than Athens, while even Thrace, perennially neglected because of its large Moslem minority and proximity to Turkey, is making progress. To back their claims of being more industrious and efficient than the volatile Athenians, local businessmen point out that one-third of manufacturing output and over half of exports originate in the north. Northern Greek companies, generally medium-sized and family-run, show a higher return on capital and a stronger commitment to investing than those elsewhere in Greece. And although both the export-oriented textile industry and manufacturing for the domestic market are feeling the effects of recession, unemployment is estimated at 2-to-3 percentage points below the 9 per cent national average. Costs are rising, but support prices for crops like cotton, tobacco and rice, grown widely in northern Greece but only on a small scale elsewhere in the Community, are expected to remain at satisfactory levels. There is considerable scope for developing tourism, mostly confined to Thessaloniki itself and the Halkidiki peninsula. But this is not to say that northern Greece is undiscovered: remote mountain villages in Epirus and the Prespa lakes, on the border with Albania and the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia, can seem surprisingly full of north European walkers and birdwatchers. Yet the northern Greeks feel strongly that prosperity has been achieved in spite of, rather than with, the support of the government. The country's centralised power structure, with decision-making concentrated in Athens, have made it easy to ignore the problems and the potential of northern Greece. Even when large EC grants started to become available, programmes were approved and allocations made in the capital. 'The minister for Macedonia and Thrace is only a figurehead. This is recognised in Athens but political will is needed to change the situation. It's an urgent issue, because this is a time when we can build relationships in the Balkans from Thessaloniki,' says Mr George Tzitzikostas, a conservative deputy who held the portfolio last year. The collapse of communism in the Balkans opened the door to increased trade and investment in an area where Greek merchant communities flourished from the late 18th century until the second world war. But the heady optimism of two years ago, with expectations of Thessaloniki's becoming a platform for western investment in the southern Balkans, has dissipated in the face of the violent break-up of Yugoslavia and the slow pace of economic reform in Albania and Bulgaria. Indeed, there is growing concern that conflict in the former Yugoslavia could spread as far south as the Greek border, sending a wave of refugees into northern Greece. Meanwhile, Greece's own dispute with the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia over nomenclature adds to the uncertainty. Greek insistence that the neighbouring republic cannot be recognised under the name of Macedonia exasperates the rest of the EC, all the more so since the Athens government is not willing to sit down and negotiate a solution with its counterpart in Skopje. As borders start to be questioned elsewhere, the Greek view that recognition of ex-Yugoslav Macedonia could one day give rise to a territorial claim on its own province of Macedonia no longer seems so far-fetched. But to foreign observers, Greece not only has little to fear as the only Nato and EC member in the Balkans, but risks losing a chance to play a leading role in the region's transition to a market economy. It therefore comes as a surprise to hear the western-educated business elite in Thessaloniki endorse the government's hardline position. Despite the loss of trade and even some manufacturing facilities in ex-Yugoslav Macedonia as a result of the dispute, the northern Greeks are for once firmly behind Athens. This attitude seems rooted in a previous Balkan upheaval after Epirus, Macedonia and Thrace were prised away from the Ottoman empire to form a much larger Greece. For the Greeks, the culminating victory in the Balkan wars was the capture of Thessaloniki in 1912. However, northern Greece only acquired its modern demographic shape a decade later, with the arrival of 700,000 Greeks from Turkey in a population exchange following a disastrous Greek military defeat in Asia Minor. 'The Greeks expelled from Asia Minor, whether merchants or farmers, were the key to Macedonia's development. The history of that period still influences the present,' says Prof John Koliopoulos, of Thessaloniki University. If the northern Greeks still have a sense of insecurity, despite their achievements, it is only to be expected that the issue of minorities is a sensitive one. Although successive Greek governments have tried to emphasise the homogeneity of the modern state - with the exception of the Moslems in Thrace - it is proving impossible to keep the lid on the Slav-speakers of northern Greece. Officially, Slav-speakers number 35,000; but add up the figures given by local officials across northern Greece, and it is clear that some 100,000 people have an understanding of the Slav dialect used in Greece. The Greek worry is that they will one day demand to be treated as an ethnic minority, fuelling a possible territorial claim by the Slavs of ex-Yugoslav Macedonia. Recently, one or two attempts by Slav-speakers to form cultural clubs have been turned down by local courts. 'We don't pose a threat to anyone. We're Greek citizens, but we have a rich cultural tradition and a language we want to preserve,' says Mr Traianos Pasois, who belongs to a group of Slav-speaking activists. While turmoil in ex-Yugoslavia casts a definite shadow over northern Greece's present prospects, it contributes, paradoxically, to a feeling of confidence about the medium-term outlook. With the road through Serbia to western Europe blocked, priority must be given to completing an alternative export route across northern Greece to ports in Epirus. The port of Thessaloniki also stands to gain as an outlet for Romania and Bulgaria. Northern Greek exporters are taking a strong interest in the Bulgarian market, while contacts are being made in Russia and the Ukraine. However, if the efficiently run companies in northern Greece are to make the most of new opportunities in the region, they will have to start considering some restructuring and modernisation of management. Investment banking is not yet a serious part of Thessaloniki business life, but it is significant that of 300 northern companies which meet the requirements for a listing on the Athens Stock Exchange, only a dozen have so far taken the plunge.</p>

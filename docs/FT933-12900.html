			<p>930722 FT  22 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Gatt in new study of banana regime DEVELOPING countries from rival groups of banana producers clashed yesterday in the ruling council of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade over the European Community's controversial banana import policies, Reuter reports from Geneva. The debate went on for three hours before being suspended until the next session in September, according to trade officials. However, they said that Gatt had now formed a panel to report on whether the EC's new regime, which, like its predecessor, has also split the Community, violated international fair trade rules. Jamaica, a member of the Africa, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) group of former colonies of European states, appealed for rejection of an earlier panel report which declared the EC's previous banana import regulations to be in violation of Gatt rules. 'Its conclusions could destroy the future of 69 developing nation states,' said Jamaica's ambassador, Mr Richard Pierce. Costa Rica argued for approval, speaking for five Latin American states whose bananas are subject to heavy EC duties and import ceilings. The EC blocked approval of the report last month, but has since introduced new rules imposing a tariff quota of 2m tonnes a year on non-ACP imports. Earlier, the council agreed to work for early admission of Saudi Arabia as a full member after the kingdom's application won support from Middle East and Asian states. The latter argued that Saudi entry would help Gatt move towards bringing in all the world's trading states.</p>

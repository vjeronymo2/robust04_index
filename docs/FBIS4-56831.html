			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference with President-elect Ernesto Perez </F> Balladares by unidentified domestic and foreign correspondents  at the presidential palace in Panama City; broadcast in progress  -- live]    [Text] [Perez Balladares] ...he fulfilled his promise and  we discussed the transition and the teams that will work  together to complete that transition within the deadline  established by the law, so that on 1 September we will not have  to delay state affairs due to a lack of knowledge about them.    [Correspondent] [Question indistinct]    [Perez] Pardon me?    [Correspondent] [Question indistinct]    [Perez] We will do that as often as necessary, of course.    [Correspondent] Will you (?begin working) prior to 1  September?    [Perez] No, no, no. The president is president until 1  September. We must respect him as president of the Republic  until 1 September, and after that as former president.    [Correspondent] What mechanisms will be used for the  transition?    [Perez] Teams will be formed and they will work together  from  now until 1 September, thereby ensuring a trauma-free transition.    [Correspondent] Is it true that your government will have  another type of team apart from the Democratic Revolutionary  Party?    [Perez] I have said I will form a broad-based government, if  that is what you are referring to. We are still working on that.    [Correspondent] Doctor, what about the future of government  employees?    [Perez] At ease. I have no doubt whatsoever that the  government employees know perfectly well that I intend to  respect them and to hasten as much as possible the approval of  the administrative career.    [Correspondent] Dr. Balladares, what will relations with the  United States be like?    [Perez] We hope they will be elevated in character because  our countries are united by common interests. I do not have the  slightest doubt that this will be the case and that between the  two countries we will do things to improve the Panamanian  people's lives.    [Correspondent] President Carter said today that President  Clinton's prospective ambassador to Panama is Robert Pastor.  What do you think of that?    [Perez] I do not know. President Endara and his  administration will have to decide that. I will respect their  decision.    [Correspondent] Endara said he was delaying the (?angry man)  until after the elections.    [Perez] The elections are over.    [Correspondent] Can you tell us how these teams will work?  Will they be part of a ministry or independent?    [Perez] They will be appointed by President Endara and I and  they will work together so that we will keep abreast of matters  pending completion.    [Correspondent] [Question indistinct]    [Perez] No, no, no. Outside. [Word indistinct] the  presidency.    [Correspondent] There is a fear of a return of militarism.  This was the first weapon used by your political opponents.    [Perez] Looking at your pants, yes.    [Correspondent] Doctor, what about relations with Cuba?    [Perez] Relations with Cuba will be exactly like relations  with any other country in the world. I hope they will be  elevated in character and respectful; each country has its  political system and I demand respect for both. In other words,  they must not meddle in our affairs, nor we in theirs.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yeoryios Karelias] </F>   [Excerpts] PASOK's [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] calm  waters were disturbed following the election of its new  Executive Bureau. Prominent members like Theodhoros Pangalos  and Vaso Papandreou were not elected, while Konstandinos Simitis  just made it. The three are considered to be "antileaders."    Akis Tsokhatzopoulos' team is considered responsible for the  exclusion. Tsokhatzopoulos, who controls the largest group in  the Central Committee and has Prime Minister Andreas  Papandreou's support, was triumphantly reelected secretary.  <H5>  Questions and Explanations </H5>   Pangalos' and Papandreou's exclusion raises justified  questions. This is because:    -- The alternate foreign minister was triumphantly present  at  the recent congress, coming in second in voting after Yeoryios  Yennimatas. In his case, PASOK's Central Committee disagreed  with the feelings of the party's organized supporters.    -- Vaso Papandreou was the big winner of the national  elections, ranking first in Athens B District. She also did  very well at the congress (she ranked sixth in the Central  Committee voting). In her case, the Central Committee disagreed  with PASOK's voting and partisan basis.    -- Konstandinos Simitis was 12th out of 18 members. The last  time, he was at the top of the Executive Bureau. Simitis and  Pangalos are considered to be the two that will most probably  pursue the party's leadership when Papandreou decides to resign.    The outcome of the election the day before yesterday may be  explained as follows:    -- Pangalos "paid" for his recent, continuous, and  "heretical" remarks on various issues. Mainly, however, he paid  for his very recent statement that he will pursue the party's  leadership.    -- Simitis, who nearly did not get elected, "paid" for being  against Tsokhatzopoulos at the party congress. Simitis was the  only Executive Bureau member who insisted that a vote be taken  on the incompatibility of being a secretary and a minister. It  is well-known that the congress finally adopted this position.  The day before yesterday, Tsokhatzopoulos' team "paid him  back." Associates of the party's secretary and other officials  blamed the small number of votes received by Simitis on the fact  that his side is mainly responsible for the 29 blank votes cast  during Tsokhatzopoulos election.    -- It seems that Vaso Papandreou "paid" for her  antileadership remarks, her accusations about the operation of  mechanisms, and her rapid promotion through the mass media.    Last night, PASOK members characteristically said that "it  was Akis' [Tsokhatzopoulos] revenge" and expressed skepticism  about future interparty operations, particularly what could  happen when Papandreou leaves the leadership.  <H5>  Initiatives and Relaxation </H5>   Initiatives are expected to be adopted in the next few days  to relax the situation. Yerasimos Arsenis' (he ranked 7th)  office mentioned that the defense minister intends to undertake  a "joint and balanced" initiative so that future sector  secretaries will be mutually accepted in order to end the  Tsokhatzopoulos-Simitis dispute. Chamber of Deputies President  Apostolos Kaklamanis, who ranked first, expressed similar views.    Other impressive points of the election are:    -- The failure of Karolos Papoulias and Evangelos Venizelos  to get elected in the new Executive Bureau despite Papandreou's  wishes. The prime minister appears dissatisfied with this  development. Venizelos' failure is again attributed to  Tsokhatzopoulos team, given that the government spokesman is the  secretary's opponent in Thessaloniki. In the last elections,  Venizelos ranked first. Indicatively, the organization's  secretary in Thessaloniki, Ioannis Magkriotis, a close associate  of Tsokhatzopoulos, was elected to the Executive Bureau.    Papoulias' failure is attributed to the fact that he has  minimal party involvement so far.    -- That Kaklamanis was first. Kaklamanis wants to play the  top role in PASOK when Papandreou decides to jump over to the  presidency. In any case, the Chamber of Deputies president  refrains from referring publicly to this issue and stresses his  unifying role, which secured him first place.    -- The failure of Yeoryios Papandreou, who did very well at  the congress. Khatzimikhalis, a member of the former Executive  Bureau, also was not elected. Anastasios Peponis, the deputy  minister to the prime minister, who was a member of the former  Executive Bureau, was not a candidate, saying he prefers to deal  solely with his ministerial duties.    -- That second place went to Konstandinos Laliotis who kept  saying he is not a part of "groups and mechanisms." [passage  omitted]  <H5>  Composition and Reaction </H5>   Five ministers (Konstandinos Laliotis, Yerasimos Arsenis,  Ioannis Souladhakis, Konstandinos Skandhalidhis, Konstandinos  Simitis), a deputy minister (Andonios Kotsakas) and a ministry  secretary general (Papaioannou) are in the new Executive Bureau.  All of them can retain both positions, since the recent  congress decision provides that at least nine of the Executive  Bureau members should not have a government position.    Eleven Executive Bureau members currently meet this  requirement. Papandreou now has to name those who will  participate in the Executive Bureau's Political Bureau and in  the Executive Secretariat.    After the outcome of the voting:    -- Simitis said blocking mechanisms had operated, thus  indirectly accusing Tsokhatzopoulos' side. He wished that the  Central Committee "would realize that more unity is necessary."    -- Vaso Papandreou noted that the congress had one view and  the Central Committee another. In the same spirit, Pangalos  said that the organized base of the party thought differently  than the Central Committee.    -- Oikonomou, who was not elected, spoke about "the  aristocracy of mediocrity." Thessaloniki Deputy Kastanidhis  noted that some members who are distinguished in society were  not elected, while the opposite happened with others. He said  this is because "mechanisms of mediocrity" prevail.</p>

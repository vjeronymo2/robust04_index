			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Enlarged MY 24% higher at Pounds 1.13m MY Holdings, the enlarged specialist packaging group, returned pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.13m for the half year ended February 26, an improvement of 24 per cent over last time's Pounds 911,000. Turnover rose by 19 per cent to Pounds 19.1m with recent acquisitions, Kohler Packaging and Doncaster Packaging, contributing Pounds 818,000 to turnover and Pounds 89,000 to operating profits. Last month, MY expanded further via the Pounds 21.3m purchase of Insight Cartons, a provider of printed folding cartons primarily for the food industry. Consideration was funded by a placing and open offer which raised Pounds 23m. MY's majority shareholder, Malbak, took up only part of its rights under the open offer. That reduced its shareholding in the group from 85.7 per cent to 65 per cent and allowed MY to return to the main market. Mr John Grainger, chairman, said the half year results were scored against a backdrop of 'muted demand and fierce competition'. He added that the board remained 'concerned' in the short term over the weakness of the UK economy. Earnings per share emerged at 1.77p (1.48p) and, as forecast, the interim dividend is being doubled to 0.5p. The board expects to maintain the final payment at last year's level of 1p.</p>

			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Catering for the ethical shopper / A look at a growing consumer trend Companies have long responded to green consciousness by making concern for the environment an important business objective. But a growing number of consumers claim to base their purchasing decisions on a much wider range of ethical issues. David Grayson, managing director of the business strategy group at Business in the Community, uses the term vigilante consumer, coined by US trend-spotter Faith Popcorn, to describe consumers who are not just interested in the products or services they buy but the behaviour of the company behind the brand and the way the product or service is developed. Vigilante consumers are a powerful force in the US, where the Council of Economic Priorities, a consumer group, has sold over 4m copies of its booklet Shopping For a Better World. This lists companies which have scored top marks on their record on issues ranging from animal testing to links with South Africa. The UK edition launched by the publishing house New Consumer in September 1991 has sold just 7,662 copies. But Grayson asserts that these consumers are a growing and vocal minority. A Mori survey showed that the number of consumers who rated a company's activities in the community as very important has grown from 33 per cent in 1991 to 35 per cent in 1992. Sceptics say there are already signs that the prolonged recession has blunted the impact of green consumers. But proponents of the vigilante consumer argument maintain that ethical concerns will become integral to corporate decision-making in the 1990s. Grand Metropolitan has long taken the view that corporate ethics affect consumers' purchasing decisions. Its public policy issues scan system in the US - a forward-looking data base of consumer concerns - tracks a wide range of issues that go beyond the food and drink industry. The most pertinent issues that are likely to arise in the next three to five years are sent to Grand Met's operating companies to assess their likely impact. Managers then decide whether to change policy, lobby government or direct efforts into re-educating the public. Raymond Krause, senior vice-president of government and community affairs at Grand Met, believes the company's system is more sophisticated than its rivals. It is also expensive - updating the data every three years can cost Dollars 1m (Pounds 662,000) - but Krause claims there is a tangible benefit. He points to Grand Met subsidiary Green Giant which identified in 1989 that the use of CFCs in freezing vegetables was a legitimate issue of public concern. It began phasing them out that year before individual states imposed taxes on their use and public concern reached fever pitch. Levi Strauss, the jeans manufacturer, believes companies must scrutinise their business practices and those of their suppliers, retailers and business partners. Last year Levi issued global sourcing guidelines setting out new terms of engagement with suppliers and retailers, excluding those operating in countries with 'oppressive' regimes. The same principle is being tentatively taken up by Premier Beverages, a division of Premier Brands. Last year the company became aware of growing public and staff concern over the employment policies of its tea suppliers. In February Premier Beverages launched its fair trade initiative of selecting plantations on social and environmental criteria and placed the 'Caring for tea and our tea pickers' logo on all Typhoo tea packaging. Dragon International, a London-based marketing design consultancy, says consumers are often unaware of companies' ethical policies, and that responsible companies can benefit from promoting their good deeds. Last December, Timberland, the shoe manufacturer, ran an advertising campaign against racism in the US and Germany in partnership with charitable bodies. In the US, Timberland linked up with Boston-based organisation City Year which is campaigning for the public to help regenerate inner cities. The press ads did not just publicise Timberland's stance on racism but encouraged consumer support for the City Year project. It set up a phone line manned by employees and received 300-500 calls a week. Companies which have been the target of consumer boycotts are increasingly on the defensive. Nestle has been the target of a long-running campaign by the International Baby Food Action Network over its practice of promoting bottle feeding in the developing world. Although Nestle says the campaign has not had a discernible impact on UK sales, figures from market research organisation Nielsen show that Nescafe's share of the instant coffee market dipped to 40 per cent in 1992 from 41 per cent in 1991 when the Church of England Synod lent its voice to the boycott.</p>

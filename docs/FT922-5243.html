			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / Arts: Appliance of science - Sponsorship The recession is having one salutary effect on arts sponsors. It is forcing them to evaluate their expenditure more scientifically. In the past companies distributed largess freely, often deriving little in return but a warm glow. Now chief executives, and especially finance directors, want a justification for the budget. What were the objectives of the sponsorship and were they realised? Unfortunately, extensive market research into particular events can cost almost as much as the original sponsorship, but some companies, such as Lloyds, undertake an assessment as a matter of course. It evaluated its investment in the Age of Chivalry exhibition at the Royal Academy, and constantly measures the impact of its Young Musician of the Year link with the BBC. BMW, which last week supported the opening concert of the Bath Festival, is another company which researches its carefully pinpointed sponsored events. The latest to buy sponsorship research, through consultancy Millward Brown, which specialises in the field, is NatWest. It made a commitment this year to Welsh National Opera's Pelleas et Melisande, putting in Pounds 250,000 to ensure the production fully realised the director's ambitions. NatWest felt it was worthwhile measuring the result. The research suggested that most (72 per cent) of the audience at the performances were aware that NatWest sponsored the opera (way ahead of the 51 per cent norm at a sponsored event), and they approved, appreciating that the production gained from the money. An unexpected finding was that the audience felt NatWest should have banged the drum of its involvement more loudly. Millward Brown also quizzed NatWest's guests, the 50 or 60 existing or potential customers that it invited to each performance. Here again they welcomed the opportunity to meet their bank managers in a social context, believing it would make doing business easier. NatWest will use the findings to plan future sponsorships. It is aware that such research is necessarily superficial. It cannot examine any increase in brand awareness, or appreciation of NatWest, among the wider public and, anyway, the reaction of the audience, and guests, is likely to be favourable. Ironically this more business-like approach comes at a time when NatWest is reducing its sponsorship budget in the wake of falling profits. But this way the future lies. The Association for Business Sponsorship of the Arts is devising a research facility for interested sponsors. It is well aware that the case for backing the arts has to be made more forcefully and persuasively in the current climate. It also knows that research could show that sponsorship is a waste of time and money. But measuring the effectiveness of sponsorship will inevitably become more important in the cash-straitened future.                         *       *      * On June 13, Placido Domingo celebrates his 21st year as a Covent Garden star, singing a title role in Samson et Dalila - and at the same time helping Midland Bank to mark its 21st year as a Covent Garden sponsor. The Midland Bank Proms, through which all the seats are removed from the stalls of the Opera House and 700, mainly youthful, enthusiasts sit on the floor for just Pounds 9, must be the longest major continuous arts sponsorship in the UK. It is one that excellently suits both parties. Covent Garden sheds its elitist image for a few days and Midland Bank is seen in a favourable light by its target audience of bright young things. It is an occasion now bathed in history with no plans to break the connection. The cost for Midland has risen sharply. At the first Prom, on September 28 1972, the audience paid 50p. The Bank makes up to Covent Garden the difference between a sold-out stalls, with seats ranging from Pounds 70 to Pounds 150, and the Pounds 9 bargain. It will foot a Pounds 250,000 bill this year, for as an anniversary celebration, the five nights of opera include not only Domingo, but Maria Ewing in Salome, and the first night, next Monday, of a new production of Der fliegende Hollander. All told over 100,000 Prommers have attended 143 opera and ballet performances on the cheap. This year the number will be boosted by the transmission on June 13 of Samson et Dalila live on the big screen into the Covent Garden piazza. Not surprisingly, given its financial problems, the Midland has cut its arts sponsorship in the last two years but it is staying faithful to the Garden. As well as the Proms it backs the regional tour by Birmingham Royal Ballet.                         *       *      * Next year a British writer will scoop up the Pounds 30,000 David Cohen British Literature Prize in recognition of a lifetime's achievement at the typewriter/word processor. This will be the Big One, beating in value the other leading book awards, the Booker, by Pounds 10,000, and the NCR, by Pounds 5,000. The Arts Council will chip in another Pounds 10,000 which goes to a young writer of the winner's choice. The cheque will be issued by Coutts Bank. Coutts has long literary traditions - Dickens, Browning and Tennyson were customers - and it is supplying the Arts Council and the David Cohen Trust with back up in organising the prize. Coutts carries out some discreet sponsorship of its own. It organises concerts for its clients at which students of the Royal College of Music play with established soloists. Earlier this year guitarist John Williams performed; later this year it's the turn of percussionist Evelyn Glennie.                         *       *      * While more and more sponsors fail to renew their connections, arts sponsorship could still grow this year, thanks to small sponsors dipping their toe in the water. The latest group to show an interest is hairdressers. Graham Webb International has put up Pounds 1,000 to bring the National Youth Jazz Orchestra to the Sevenoaks Festival. Last year a Hexham salon, Sherlock Hair Shop, contributed Pounds 1,000 to coax Phoenix Dance Company to the Northumbrian town.</p>

The country programme prepared by India, with the help of  UNDP and the cooperation of Indian industry, was recently  approved by the executive committee on country programmes under  the Montreal Protocol. Under the Protocol, the entire  incremental cost of the phaseout in India, whose annual  consumption of the environmentally damaging chemicals is less  than 0.3 kg per capita, is to be met by the global fund. The Rs.  6,000 crores approved is the first part of the payment.    India is unique among developing countries as it is  self-sufficient in the production of chlorofluorocarbons and is  expected to soon produce halons in sufficient quantities to meet  the domestic demand. In 1991 the total consumption of the  harmful chemicals in India was about 10,000 tonnes. By the year  2010, the demand and consumption is expected to rise to 1,84,000  tonnes. A large part of the increase is expected in the  airconditioning and refrigeration industries.</p>

			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Letter: EBRD is right to develop local units Sir, Your article 'Bank to set up shop in east Europe', (April 27) comes amid sharp criticism of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development from its member countries. The news that the EBRD will set up more local institutions in eastern European is, however, a laudable development. It should be praised for three reasons: Multilateral lending institutions' development programmes in eastern Europe should be well-integrated into the client countries' own economic reform efforts. Joint management boards are a step in the right direction. These local institutions can give reformers a voice in the development process and access to critical resources. They can also lead to improved co-ordination between multilateral and bilateral assistance efforts, an important but elusive goal. Cost inefficiency is not just a problem at the EBRD. It affects other bilateral and multilateral assistance as well. When industrialised nations are in recession, spending foreign aid carefully must be a priority. By increasing reliance on field offices and local staff, administrative costs can be curbed; better matching can also be sought between lending efforts and the real problems. In those recipient nations plagued by high inflation and a weak, non-convertible currency, direct investments of hard currency buy more goods and services than they do in the west. In this way, on-site, direct lending can promote savings and extend tight international assistance budgets. It sends the right message to clients of the bank. For too long, development has been operated as a 'command economy', putting the needs of lenders and donors before those of recipients. A greater orientation towards in-country activities reinforces the spirit of co-operation during painful transition programmes. Decentralised administration can strengthen the credibility - and long-term feasibility - of the multilateral lending institutions' programme.

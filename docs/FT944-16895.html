			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / International Company News: French ministry acts to stem losses at Eurocopter The French defence ministry is to speed up FFr800m (Dollars 151.51m) of its planned purchases from Eurocopter to stem financial and job losses at the Franco-German helicopter joint venture, Mr Jean-Francois Bigay, Eurocopter president, said yesterday. However, Eurocopter will end the year FFr350m in the red - compared with last year's loss of FFr462m - because of lower production and extra charges for some 350 planned voluntary redundancies at its Marignane plant near Marseilles, Mr Bigay said in an interview with the Les Echos financial daily. The ministry's accelerated orders for 14 Fennec, Panther and Cougar helicopters and for additional spare parts will only affect the group's French division, which accounts for most of Eurocopter's production capacity. Eurocopter is owned 70 per cent by Aerospatiale of France and 30 per cent by Deutsche Aerospace. Mr Bigay said the ministry had been spending so much of its helicopter budget on developing the Tigre and NH-90 models that it had virtually nothing left to buy other helicopters off the production line. The development of the NH-90 is proving a drain on Eurocopter, which is funding 18 per cent of this four-nation collaborative programme between France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands.</p>

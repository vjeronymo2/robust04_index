			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Wardle Storeys seeks buys on 13% rise - Second-half plastics recovery and investment benefits improve profits as sales fall WARDLE STOREYS, the cash-rich plastic fabrics and safety equipment company, yesterday labelled 1993 the 'year of acquisitions' as it reported a 13 per cent advance in annual pre-tax profits to Pounds 9.2m. Mr Brian Taylor, chief executive, said the company was in talks on several potential purchases, including one in the US where it has only a small presence. Wardle, which finished the year with net cash of Pounds 34m, was aiming to make several smaller purchases in each of its main businesses, as opposed to a single large one, he said. The pre-tax advance was struck on sales 2 per cent lower at Pounds 76.6m for the 12 months to August 31. Mr Taylor said the increase had been due to a recovery in the plastic fabrics business during the second half, and the efficiency benefits of an ongoing investment programme. The increase had been achieved in spite of 'the bizarre events which surround us', he said. A well-known sceptic when it comes to politicians, Mr Taylor was scathing about the current direction of UK economic policy. 'They are a pack of wallies,' he said. 'Economic policy can best be described as a series of successive reactions to a series of successive emergencies.' He admitted, however, that the devaluation of sterling was likely to benefit Wardle in the medium term. Strongest performance came from the safety and survival equipment division, which includes products such as parachutes and life rafts. Operating profits rose by 38 per cent to Pounds 3.8m on sales 7 per cent higher at Pounds 26m. However, the inflatables operation - especially in the UK - was proving disappointing. 'That is the only thing which is causing us to exercise a note of caution,' Mr Taylor said. Technical products, including plastic fabrics for use in the automotive and baby buggy markets, increased profits by Pounds 100,000 to Pounds 2.1m, on a Pounds 3.3m drop in sales to Pounds 50.6m. The final dividend is maintained at 12p for a total of 16p (16p). Earnings per share increased by 10 per cent to 25p. COMMENT Whatever one thinks of Brian Taylor's politics - or lack of them - these commendable results have been achieved in a trying environment. The challenge now will be to find an earnings-enhancing acquisition. Mr Taylor's last two significant attempts - hostile bids for Chamberlain Phipps and Armstrong Equipment - left his reputation as a dealmaker bruised and battered. It would appear the lesson has been learnt, and he is looking at friendlier deals. The possible move into the US looks interesting, given the potential for economic recovery and the company's relatively low exposure there. Forecasts of Pounds 10m, with a p/e of about 15, make the shares look fully valued in the short-term but an acquisition could make a world of difference. However, Wardle's exposure to the automotive market makes it a good candidate for recovery in the medium-term.</p>

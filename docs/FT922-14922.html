			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Election 1992: C2s cheer electoral reform supporters IT'S the C2s - those semi-skilled workers allegedly flocking to Mr Neil Kinnock's banner - rather than the chattering classes who are in the vanguard of the movement for constitutional reform. So proclaimed Charter 88 yesterday at the launch of its 'Democracy Day'  - a reform crusade involving more than a hundred meetings of election candidates in pubs and halls across Britain last night. Electoral reform, freedom of information and incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into English law may not yet be the talk of the street over a pint in The Rover's Return, but Charter 88 says it's the C2s who are keenest to bring down the whole rotten system. To prove it, Professor David Marquand, very much an A1 from Sheffield University, appeared at a meeting in London brandishing findings of an NOP poll, conducted for Charter 88 in the first week of the election campaign. These revealed that of all social classes, semi-skilled workers were most dissatisfied with the existing political system. Asked if they thought Britain's system of government 'could be improved quite a lot' or 'needs a great deal of improvement', 50 per cent of As and Bs agreed, 63 per cent of C1s did so, but 75 per cent of C2s assented. Mr Peter Pulzer, professor of government at Oxford, was convinced constitutional reform issues would dominate the next parliament. 'This election is the beginning of the end of unrepresentative and over-centralised government in the UK,' he said gravely. It was a line cheered by Mr Graham Mather, erstwhile director of the Institute of Economic Affairs. 'Supporters of market economics are increasingly recognising that the advances of the 1980s need to be followed by tackling institutional problems in the 1990s,' he said. Nodding vigorously, Ms Beverley Anderson, Charter 88's chairperson, stressed the number of Tories taking part in last night's debates. Who knows, before long they might even climb on to soap boxes and start preaching the virtues of the single transferable vote in multi-member constituencies. Editorial Comment, Page 14</p>

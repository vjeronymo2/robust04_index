We offer readers excerpts from the section  on the main industrial sectors.    The crucial factor in industrial development in 1994 will be  not so much the significant (60 percent) slowdown in the decline  as the character of the specific tasks and problems occurring in  the sectors in whose solution the state must be actively  involved.    The main problems material production will encounter in 1994  can be split into three groups. The first is the group of  general economic and financial problems that objectively exist  and adversely affect practically all aspects of the economy.  The second group of problems is associated with sector and  product supply and demand discrepancies. The third group of  problems is the problems of specific enterprises, coupled with  regional peculiarities.    The first group certainly includes problems of nonpayments  and lack of funds for development. In the Economics Ministry's  opinion, the main ways of solving these problems might include  paying off the state's debt and helping to pay off the CIS's  debt. As of October 1993 this sum was of the order of 25 percent  of the economy's debts. In view of the fact that it is  estimated that the paying off of this part of the debt could  have a threefold multiplication effect given the particular  mechanism currently being prepared at the Economics Ministry,  the problem of nonpayments could be resolved in principle.    The only way to solve the problems in the second and third  groups is on the basis and within the framework of the  implementation of a selective structural policy by finally  putting into operation a mechanism for selecting enterprises  either for support or for reorganization on the basis of the  bankruptcy procedure.    Hitherto limited support funds have been allocated, often  without any assessment of production efficiency, without their  being combined with a financial clean-up and organizational and  technological renewal of the production potential. Selective  support for individual production facilities and projects must  be implemented on the basis of a thorough analysis of the  support recipients and in accordance with adopted federal  programs.    In view of the limited financial resources, it is necessary  to establish the principle of killing several birds with one  stone. In other words, the task is to ensure that the selective  identification of support recipients makes it possible to tackle  problems that lie within the sphere of interests of several  sectors or regions.    In 1994 there must be an active policy of reorganizing  nonviable enterprises and inefficient production facilities,  which are a major drain on the budget and are holding up  structural transformations in the economy. A tougher credit and  finance policy without appropriate changes in the institutional  sphere, above all the absence of the practice of bankruptcies,  will constantly exacerbate the problem of nonpayments, which  will ultimately affect the level of industrial production.    More and more enterprises can be expected to adapt to the  prevailing conditions in 1994, with the majority of enterprises  being able to ensure the volume of sales that is required for  their normal operation. But if uncompetitive enterprises do not  cease operations, they will have to be maintained by the budget  at the cost of an increased tax burden. Should this happen,  there will be no movement of capital from inefficient to  efficient producers, whose development will be held up.  <H5>  The Fuel and Energy Complex </H5>   Production and extraction of fuel resources in 1994 is  forecast to be 6 percent below the 1993 level.    Oil and gas condensate extraction in 1994 is estimated at  327  million tonnes, as opposed to 357 million tonnes in 1993 (taking  extraction by joint ventures into account). But the rate of  decline in oil extraction will total 8 percent in 1994, as  opposed to 10.5 percent in 1993 and 14 percent in 1992.    It is only possible to prevent a decline in oil extraction  and then stabilize it if development of new fields with total  reserves of 6-8 billion tonnes is expedited.    In 1993 the Russian Federation Government exempted oil  industry enterprises from paying import and export duties, and  also granted concessions in the shape of an exemption from the  mandatory sale of their foreign exchange earnings from oil  exports so as to provide an incentive for work to develop new  fields and bring dormant wells on stream. Foreign firms have  been involved in repairing wells. The concessions have been  worth around R1.8 trillion to oil drilling enterprises. The  rate of decline in oil extraction has slowed as a result.    It will be necessary to preserve existing measures of state  support in 1994 in order to develop this trend in the oil  extracting industry. It is also planned to leave up to 60  percent of the oil lifted from new wells in the hands of the  sector so as to ensure that the funds raised from its sale are  channeled into modernization, new construction work, and the  development of new fields.    Supplies of crude oil to refineries in 1994 are forecast at  225-226 million tonnes (taking joint-venture and  customer-supplied crude into account) -- in other words, at  close to the 1993 level. Production of light oil products will  increase somewhat on last year's level, reaching 32.2 million  tonnes for gasoline, 58.1 million tonnes for diesel, and 12.5  million tonnes for jet engine fuel.    The problem in developing the sector is the low utilization  of Russia's refinery capacity for the primary processing of oil  -- refineries (not counting enterprises in Groznyy) were  operating at 72 percent of capacity in 1993. Yet certain  enterprises are operating at a critical level of utilization.    With a view to enhancing efficiency in the refining of crude  oil, a program has been drawn up to fundamentally modernize and  upgrade Russia's oil refineries. During phase one of this  program it is planned to increase the level of refining [glubina  pererabotki] from 62 to 75 percent and to considerably improve  the quality of petroleum products.    The gas industry, which has a reliable raw-material base for  further development, will in the very near future be the only  sector in the Russian Federation with the real potential to  increase production of fuel and energy resources. Gas  extraction in 1994 is expected to be 620 billion cubic meters.    But in recent years nonpayment by customers for gas used has  resulted in a virtual halt in the construction and commissioning  of new capacity in the sector owing to a lack of funds.    As of 1 October 1993 nonpayments for gas were running at  R1,345 billion. Provided that the debts owed by the state and  the CIS countries are cleared and that subsequent transactions  with most customers are effected on this basis, the gas industry  is capable of resolving the main issues of its development.    The government has made a decision to build a system of main  gas pipelines from the gas fields of the Yamal Peninsula across  Belarus and Poland to Europe. The commissioning of this sytem of  gas pipelines will make it possible to sell Europe additional  amounts of Russian gas (up to 65 billion cubic meters by the  year 2010), to provide an alternative to the current monopoly  corridor through Ukraine, and to guarantee that Russia's  obligations to supply gas for export are complied with.    Coal extraction in 1994 is forecast at approximately 250  million tonnes, as against 300 million tonnes in 1993.    It is also expected that consumer demand will fall owing to  the increased cost of the coal itself and higher transportation  costs. Any further increase in prices could substantially  reduce effective demand. Consequently, a considerable  proportion of the actual requirement for coal -- as a result of  the severe climatic conditions over most Russian territory --  might not be covered by effective demand.    The state of our coal mines is constantly deteriorating, and  labor-intensive and dangerous mining is steadily on the  increase. Our of 270 pits 60 percent have been mined for more  than 20 years and have not been modernized during that period.    In order to solve the main problems facing the coal industry  in 1994 it will be necessary to change the procedure for  allocating subsidies, with a view to steering the bulk of the  subsidies toward coal consumers -- above all, rail transport.    In 1994 it will also be necessary to start solving the very  complex problem of closing down pits and open cuts, which have  no future. A list of 42 no longer viable pits and open cuts  with a total capacity of 11.2 million tonnes of coal a year and  a workforce of more than 48,000 industrial production personnel  has now been drawn up.    Pit closures will require considerable expenditure on  social,  technical, and technological measures.    Electricity generation in 1994 is forecast at 910 billion  kilowatt-hours, as against 945 billion kilowatt-hours in 1993.  The power supply situation will remain difficult in a number of  parts of Russia.    As in all fuel and energy complex sectors, the main problem  in power generation is the inability of consumers to pay their  debts.    Since 1992 there has been state regulation in the sector of  electricity and thermal energy, which has made it possible in  the context of the gradual deregulation of prices for fuel  resources and free prices for other raw materials to set rates  for electric and thermal energy through regional power  commissions, taking account of the self-financing of power  generating enterprises and not allowing unjustifiable costs to  be included in the prime cost.    It is planned in 1994 to maintain state regulation of prices  for electricity and thermal energy at two levels -- the federal  and regional levels -- through the relevant power commissions.    Despite the shortage of investment funds, it is planned to  commission around 700,000 kilowatts of new power generating  capacity in 1994 at the Gusinoozersk and Kharanorskaya State  Regional Electric Power Stations [GRES] and at other  installations in the Far East and Siberia.    R83.5 billion will be allocated from the federal budget as a  priority in order to improve the safety of existing nuclear  electric power stations [AES]. And construction of a number of  research testbeds and installations will have to be postponed  owing to a shortage of funds. The commissioning of Power Unit  No. 3 at the Kalinin AES and Power Unit No. 5 at the Kursk AES  -- each with a 1-megawatt capacity -- will also have to be  postponed to future years, as will commissioning of the first  units at the Bureya, Boguchanskaya, and Irganayskaya  Hydroelectric Power Stations.    Thus, a problem common to all fuel and energy complex  sectors  is nonpayment, and its solution will determine the prospects for  the development and self-financing of the complex in 1994. The  budget has suffered a shortfall of around R0.6 trillion due to  nonpayments alone. And more than 90 percent of the consumers of  fuel and energy resources are now in debt. Given the specifics  of the functioning of the fuel and energy complex -- the  continuous nature of the production and consumption of fuel and  energy resoures, and the onset of the winter heating period,  during which the possibility of enforcing restrictions on  customers' access to energy resources declines substantially --  the problem of the failure to pay fuel and energy complex  enterprises for the energy resources they supply cannot be fully  resolved.    At a time of limited budget appropriations the main sources  for investment in 1994 will be enterprises' own funds and funds  specifically geared to financial support for fuel and energy  complex sectors. Appropriations from the federal budget in the  coming year will be able to provide only 3-5 percent of the  total volume of investments compared with 14 percent in 1993.  <H5>  Metallurgy </H5>   In 1994, production of finished ferrous rolled metal will  decrease by 1 million tonnes compared with 1993 and will total  42 million tonnes; the figures for the production of steel pipes  will be 0.2 million tonnes and 5.8 million tonnes, respectively.  Production will be 63 and 48 percent of total capacity,  respectively. As the economy stabilizes, the demand for metal  products will increase, which will require a larger volume of  production.    For a long time the fixed capital replacement rate in  metallurgy has been 0.9-1.2 percent, which is three to four  times less than the proper technical and economic level. What  this means is that more than 60 percent of steel and 50 percent  of rolled metal is now being produced on obsolete equipment.  The national economy loses $3.5-4 billion annually as a result  of the technical backwardness of Russian ferrous metallurgy and  the consequent increased production costs.    As well as demand constraints on ferrous metallurgy  products,  there is the inhibiting factor of problems when it comes to  supplying enterprises with refractories, which are the main  construction materials for lining heating units, not only in  metallurgy, but also in machine building, the construction  materials and chemical industries, and defense and other sectors  of industry. The production of refractories is being cut by 7  percent annually due to the depletion of existing deposits of  magnesite and the delays in the commissioning of new mines. As  a result the national economy's magnesite needs will be catered  for in 1994 by import purchases. Supplies of imported powder  will diminish as the production capacities at the Savinskoye  deposit come on stream (beginning in 1995).    The production of the basic types of nonferrous metallurgy  products is significantly affected by the foreign economic  situation and also by the provision of raw materials, which is  governed by the very slow development of the Russian mining  base. Smelting of alumina is expected to remain steady, as in  1992 and 1993.    High production costs have meant that wholesale prices of  such highly important types of nonferrous metals as lead, tin,  aluminum, and nickel have already reached or exceeded world  levels. If this trend continues and the ruble is stable against  the U.S. dollar it could result in a loss of competitiveness and  a reduction in exports and effective demand for these metals  inside the country.    Given the demand constraints on certain types of nonferrous  metals (titanium, magnesium, refined copper, zinc, and so on), a  number of enterprises producing them are using free capacities  and manpower to process customer-supplied raw materials from  countries in nearby and faraway foreign parts.    Measures are envisaged for 1994 to give state support to a  number of enterprises in the form of the allocation of quotas  for the supply of nonferrous metals for export and concessionary  export and import duties, which will make it possible to import  the requisite raw materials and supplies for industrial  engineering needs, as well as equipment to continue the  reconstruction and retooling of the production potential.    In order to maker fuller use of the metallurgical complex  production facilities established on the territory of the former  Union it is advisable to remove export duties from supplies to  CIS countries of products produced under intrasector  production-sharing arrangements, which will ensure the  production of finished products on a mutually advantageous basis.    Since the critical state of raw material provision for the  sector's enterprises due to the severe underdevelopment of the  Russian mining base because of underinvestment remains the main  problem facing the development of nonferrous metallurgy, it is  necessary to approve the "Nonferrous Metallurgy Raw Material  Base Development" program. The main sources of finance for the  national program to retool and reconstruct the enterprises and  also to develop the raw material base are enterprises' own funds  (depreciation, profits), as well as the nonbudget-financed  investment fund, which constitute 80.5 percent of the total  value of essential investment resources. Around 11.5 percent of  the money will come from export and import business concessions  and foreign investments and only 8 percent is scheduled to come  from centralized credits.  <H5>  The Chemical, Petrochemical, and Microbiological Industry </H5>   In 1994, according to the projected estimate, output of  chemical, petrochemical, and microbiological output will fall by  11 percent against the 1993 level.    The production of artificial fertilizers is by far the most  responsive to demand constraints. The country has the capacity  to produce roughly 20 million tonnes of artificial fertilizer.  This is roughly the amount required according to biological  norms for applying fertilizer to the soil. However, given the  imbalances in the correlation between prices for agricultural  produce and industrial items for the agricultural sector, even  with state financial support for the agricultural sector the  demand for artificial fertilizers, which developed in 1993 meant  that between 8.3 and 8.5 million tonnes was produced.    Demand constraints for 1994 could intensify, and production  of artificial fertilizers could drop to 6.3 million tonnes. At  the same time, opportunities for exporting artificial  fertilizers will be greatly restricted as their price is already  creeping ahead of world prices.    The main reason for the high price of artificial fertilizers  is the extremely low level at which production capacities are  utilized (37 percent).    The way out of the existing situation must lie in the  planned  withdrawal of worn-out equipment and obsolete technology, a cut  in the production of outdated products, and an increase in the  output of more progressive types of fertilizers.    Previously highly specialized enterprises producing  artificial fertilizers have started up production of products in  constant demand on the market alongside the basic production  commodity: polymer plumbing equipment, construction materials  made from scrap, bricks, tiles, sports clothes, polymer items.  In this way, the financial stability of enterprises is  attained, new jobs are created, and problems in the social  sector are resolved.    In the synthetic resins and plastics industry, proceeding  from the projected demand, production of polystyrene, PVC, and  chemical fibers and filaments will drop between 5 and 7 percent,  and output of polyethylene and polypropylene, taking due account  of the assimilation of new capacities, is set to stabilize at  the 1993 level.    It should be noted that with the attainment of stability in  the Russian economy the domestic market's capacity for chemical  products will rise once again. Therefore, considering the huge  inertia of fundamental major projects, it is essential, despite  extremely limited finances, to implement measures for the  selective state support of certain of the most important  enterprises in the mining and chemical industry.    In 1994 the total output of medical supplies is forecast to  be at the estimated 1993 level. This presupposes state  financial support for producer-enterprises and consumers of  medicines. This could be implemented by means of stopping  subsidizing imports of medical supplies and channeling the  released funds, worth R70 billion in 1994, into maintaining  health services and granting preferential medical help to the  population (accounting for up to 90 percent of the funds), and  into developing the national pharmaceutical industry (around 10  percent).    Moreover, it would be expedient to halve export and import  duties incurred by enterprises in the medical supplies industry  on exported products and purchased raw materials,  semimanufactured goods, substances, materials, and equipment.    This would make it possible to stabilize the financial  situation of enterprises in the sector and improve their  provision with the material resources essential for the  manufacture of drugs and items for medical purposes.  <H5>  Machine Building </H5>   The situation in machine building in 1994 will substantially  depend on investment activity and the possible reduction  (elimination) of demand constraints on certain types of machines  and equipment -- primarily output for consumers such as  agriculture, construction, freight and passenger transport, and  the population (passenger cars). On the whole, the decline in  output volumes at machine building complex enterprises is  expected to be of the order of 5-7 percent as opposed to 11-12  percent in 1993.    Given the forecast demand, production of the most important  types of machines and equipment supplied to vitally important  sectors of industry and the national economy -- equipment for  the fuel and energy complex, diesel engines and diesel  generators, AC electric motors, basic types of rolling stock for  rail transport, and other types of equipment -- is planned to be  at or slightly below the 1993 level.    In the machine tool and tool making industry the strained  situation with the sale of metalworking equipment and tools --  primarily of the high-tech variety -- will persist, as it did in  1993.    With a view to adapting machine tool making enterprises to  market conditions, retaining their collectives, and making best  use of their production potential, work is actively under way to  convert them to the production of multipurpose equipment with  manual control, as well as bench metal-cutting and wood  processing machine tools that are in demand from small and  commercial enterprises and from the population. Moreover,  enterprises in this sector are assimilating production of  products that are new to the machine tool and tool making  industry. This is allowing them to retain their collectives and  survive in market economy conditions. But the sector of the  machine-tool and tool-making industry producing high-tech  machinery and equipment may lose its scientific, production, and  personnel potential without state investment support.    Demand constraints are having a particularly negative impact  on the performance of enterprises in the subsector of tractor  and agricultural machine building. As a result, production of  marketable output in 1994 will fall 12 percent in comparison  with 1993. Yet rural commodity producers are not refusing to  take this equipment because they do not need it but because they  lack the funds to pay for it, in part because of their  nonreceipt of funds for agricultural output consigned to the  state.    In the automotive industry a complex situation is developing  in terms of passenger car sales. The rise in prices and  corresponding shrinkage of demand is not only the result of cost  inflation in the industrial sectors that supply their products  to car plants. In the automotive industry costs for which the  vehicle builders themselves are responsible are extremely high.    But, taking account of the acuteness of the situation and  the  need to retain an automotive industry, which determines the  development of many related sectors, and considering that excise  duties are intended to apply mainly to high-profit output,  levying this duty on enterprises that produce passenger cars  should be abandoned from 1994.  <H5>  The Defense Complex </H5>   A characteristic feature of the upcoming period of  development is the implementation of targeted substantial  structural transformations in sectors of the defense industry.    It is envisioned that by the beginning of 1995 the formation  of a nucleus of specialized state enterprises to meet state  needs in the defense and security field will be complete and a  considerable proportion, primarily of enterprises undergoing  conversion, will have made the transition to the conditions of a  self-regulating open economy. It is estimated that by the end  of 1994 state enterprises could account for a total of around 20  percent of the enterprises in defense sectors of industry.    In terms of the complex as a whole, the volume of marketable  output in 1994 is predicted to be between 94 and 95 percent of  the 1993 level, and civilian output's share of total defense  complex output will increase by 3 percentage points.    The competitive mechanisms for state support for priority  areas of conversion, which have been elaborated and are being  implemented, are aimed at getting enterprises to choose for  themselves the most effective ways to respecialize their  production, to study demand, and to build economic links,  including foreign economic links.  <H5>  The Consumer Sector </H5>   The development trends, which have currently developed in  the  national economy and the measures being taken by the Russian  Federation Government to stabilize it, ensure the further  consolidation in 1994 of the structural shifts toward the  preferential development of the consumer sector. Consumer goods  production's share of total industrial output will rise to 23.8  percent in 1994 as against 23 percent in 1993.    In the manufacture of nonfood consumer goods there will be  increasing signs in 1994 of the satisfaction of effective  consumer demand for a number of the most important types of  durables.    At the same time, given the growth of effective consumer  demand and as a result of the stabilization of the population's  real incomes combined with a decline in inflation rates,  production of some cultural, everyday, and economic goods  (particularly socially significant goods) can be expected to  stay at the current year's level in 1994.    An increase in output for products produced in insufficient  quantities is expected. These include food processors,  microwave ovens, electric mincers, electric juicers of various  capacities, food mixers, and others. An increase in production  of compact monochrome television sets (there is a demand for  affordable ones) is expected to result in a 4-percent increase  in television output.    It is predicted that there will be an expansion of the range  of commodities produced for farms, yards, and market gardens,  including the production of a wide list of manual and power  tools offering increased efficiency and intensified work.    Should it not prove possible to maintain effective consumer  demand in 1994, only refrigerators and freezers can be expected  to increase against the expected 1993 level. At the same time  there could be a decline in production of washing machines and  television sets. Strong competition from higher quality imports  will most likely lead to a decline of around 20 percent in tape  player and radio equipment production in comparison with 1993.    The prediction sees a 7-percent decline in light industry  output in 1994 as against 21 percent in 1993. The decline in  cotton, woolen, and linen fabric and footwear production will  continue. Only silk fabrics, knitwear, and hosiery can expect to  match the 1993 production level in 1994.  <H5>  Conclusions </H5>   The problem for 1994 is to convert the general decline in  production into a structural process initiating progressive  structural changes. In 1994 Russian industry will face  increasing competition from foreign products on both the  domestic and the foreign market. By switching to prices at  world levels while labor productivity is lower, the products of  a considerable number of enterprises could prove uncompetitive  on the domestic market, which would require the adoption of a  number of protectionist measures with respect to the output of  individual raw material sectors (ferrous metallurgy, the  chemical and petrochemical industry, light industry) and the  global task of raising output quality -- particularly in  processing sectors.    A preliminary analysis of the problems and the cited  calculations for performance parameters in physical production  give grounds for considering that the increasing trend among  producers to aim to meet effective demand will make it possible  in 1994:     -  to ensure that most enterprises, on the basis of increased  accuracy in identifying the scale of production, have the  minimum output sales level necessary to function viably;    -  to stop a whole number of enterprises operating on their  previous institutional and technological basis and to start  redirecting capital from inefficient to efficient production  processes;    -  to ensure the development of new economic links -- internal  and  external alike.    The pursuit of a consistent structural policy will require  selective support for individual production facilities and  projects and can be implemented only on the basis of in-depth  analysis of recipients of the support in accordance with federal  programs which are adopted (after prior expert examination).    The main "players" in structural restructuring in 1994 will  be enterprises themselves. In the process many enterprises'  structural policy could change and become more active with a  view to securing the conditions for their own development,  increasing competitiveness, and achieving economic growth.    At the same time the calculations show that in the sphere of  physical production the skewed nature of the structure of  production in our country, the temporary structural imbalances  between supply and demand for a number of commodities, and the  ensuing social problems necessitate the adoption of state  decisions on:     -  settling payment arrangements with CIS countries,  particularly for energy resources;    -  renewing the mineral and raw material base;    -  overcoming the negative impact of transportation costs on the  supply and demand equation;    -  supporting industrial exports and protecting producers in our  country in the context of an "open" economy and rising domestic  prices (this applies particularly to light industry);    -  supporting effective demand in the transportation and  construction sectors and among the population.

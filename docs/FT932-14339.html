			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Unions back Yeltsin President Boris Yeltsin, campaigning for popular support in a referendum next weekend, won the backing of some of Russia's most powerful trade unions yesterday, Reuter reports from Moscow. 'The free trade unions call on all their members and other Russian citizens. . . to confirm their political trust in the president and to vote for early parliamentary elections,' the Itar-Tass news agency quoted a union appeal as saying. Next Sunday's referendum will ask the people if they support Mr Yeltsin and his reform policies and whether they favour early presidential and parliamentary elections. Mr Yeltsin yesterday met representatives of about 30 unions in the Kremlin. They included miners from western Siberia's Kuzbass field, traditional supporters of the president, as well as dockers and civil aviation workers.</p>

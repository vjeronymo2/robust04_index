			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 22 KYODO -- Social Democratic Party  [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ] Chairman Tomiichi Murayama said Tuesday  [22 february] his party will remain in the ruling coalition to  "enhance the transparency of the country's politics."    In an interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE, Murayama said "a  political force to replace the 38-year-long corruption-ridden  politics of the Liberal Democratic Party could not be formed  without the participation of the SDPJ."    "That political parties with different stances and policies  are supporting the coalition government is, in a sense, a demand  of the times, and will heighten the transparency of  politics...(the SDPJ's participation) is significant in that  sense," Murayama said.    The SDPJ is the leading bloc in the seven-party coalition  government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, which was  launched last August after the ouster of the LDP from power and  the placing of priority on legislating political reforms aimed  at cleaning up the country's politics.    Asked why the SDPJ would stick with the coalition after last  month's enactment of political reform bills, Murayama said "(the  next) general elections (under the new system mixing single-seat  districts and proportional representation) will be a turning  point deciding the framework of the coalition."    As for Hosokawa's plan to reshuffle his cabinet as early as  late this month, the SDPJ chief reiterated his opposition,  saying "if the reshuffle is conducted to replace a specific  minister, it is wrong."    "The most important thing (for the government) right now is  pump- priming measures for the economy. Ministers responsible  for (enacting) the fiscal 1994 budget should be exerting their  efforts for the people and (thus) a cabinet reshuffle at present  is inappropriate," Murayama said.    Hosokawa has expressed hopes of reorganizing his cabinet  later this month, with the media speculating that this could  mean the removal of Masayoshi Takemura from the key post of  chief cabinet secretary, perhaps to another position.    Murayama said he would not accept a ministerial post even if  urged by Hosokawa to join his new cabinet. "I assumed the SDPJ  chairmanship in response to party members' requests to maintain  party unity. Circumstances within the party will not allow me  to join (the cabinet)," he said.    On financial sources to offset the 6 trillion yen in tax  cuts, Murayama said, "the tax cuts apply only to fiscal 1994. I  think (the government) will implement tax reductions even after  the year...But before that (the SDPJ) will call for a thorough  rectification of the inequitable tax system."    Following that, he said, the government should propose and  seek the support of the people for a new tax to cover the costs  of the ongoing aging of society.    If the government takes other steps to get the support of  the  people on a new tax to finance welfare and pensions, there will  be no need to hold general elections on the issue, he said.</p>

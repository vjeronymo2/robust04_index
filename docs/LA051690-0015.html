			<p><P> May 16, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE OFFICIALS CONTINUE AERIAL SPRAYING AGAINST PESKY MEDFLY  </P> <P> Officials of Los Angeles are constantly telling us to conserve water and cut  down on usage. Seems to me they have overlooked the quickest solution: Stop the  malathion spraying so we don't have tens of thousands of people all over the  Los Angeles Basin forced into washing their cars to avoid paint damage. The  officials can't have it both ways, folks.  </P> <P> PAT MASON  </P> <P> Covina  </P></p>

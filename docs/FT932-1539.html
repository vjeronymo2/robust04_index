			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Richemont to reshape its tobacco and luxury interests SHARES in Rothmans International and Dunhill Holdings, the tobacco and luxury goods companies, were expected to be suspended from this morning after an announcement that they were talking with their parent, Richemont, about a group reorganisation. The restructuring will lead to two separate companies, one concentrating on the group's luxury goods such as Cartier, Piaget, Dunhill and Montblanc, the other focusing on the tobacco interests through Rothmans. Richemont said that grouping its luxury brands under a single company would improve marketing opportunities and be more efficient. A previously considered plan to separately list its luxury goods division, Luxco, was rejected because of tax problems. Rothmans' B shares jumped 8 per cent to 720p while Dunhill closed 18 per cent higher at 405p, after both said they would return their surplus cash to shareholders as part of the deal. The reorganisation has been debated for some time by Richemont, the Swiss-based but South African-controlled holding company set up by Mr Johann Rupert, managing director. At present, the group's structure is complicated because Cartier is jointly held through Richemont and Rothmans International, while Dunhill is 57 per cent owned by Rothmans. Richemont would remain majority shareholder in both new companies, and has proposed the reorganisation be carried out on merger terms. Shareholders in Rothmans and Dunhill will receive shares in the tobacco and luxury companies. Rothmans, which is due to announce annual results on Friday, had net cash of more than Pounds 300m last year-end, while Dunhill had Pounds 120m of net cash at its March year-end, equivalent to 71p per share. Each of the new groups would each be in the form of twinned UK and non-UK holding companies. Shareholders would receive units representing twinned shares in the holding companies, which would be listed in London. The deal may be structured to gain tax benefits in terms of minimising overseas shareholders' liability to UK advance corporation tax. Lex, Page 22; London SE, Page 42</p>

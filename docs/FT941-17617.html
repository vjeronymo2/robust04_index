			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: New investment trusts target Europe Investors who profited from the UK government's privatisation offers may be tempted by two new investment trusts which offer small shareholders a chance to take part in the coming European privatisation programme, writes Philip Coggan. Kleinwort Benson's European Privatisation investment trust, to be launched on January 11, will offer the chance to buy partly-paid shares, with 50 per cent payable on application and the rest six months later. The minimum investment is Pounds 2,000. According to Kleinwort, around Pounds 100bn of privatisation issues are expected to be launched on European stock markets over the next five years. The main issuers are expected to be France, Italy and Spain. As well as the expected utilities, companies in industries such as banking, insurance and airlines will be available. There are, however, a number of problems for UK private investors who want to buy such issues - for example, the foreign currency risk, the need to open an overseas bank account, and witholding tax on dividends. An investment trust takes away these barriers. Mercury Asset Management's European Privatisation trust will be launched in February. Like the Kleinwort issue, it will have warrants attached on a one-for-five basis and will be Pepable. Full details of the Mercury offer are not yet available but the offer price will be 100p and the annual management fee less than 1 per cent; Kleinwort's fee will be 0.75 per cent.</p>

			<p><P> December 28, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON;  </P> <P> CITY TO JOIN TALKS ON MONORAIL PLAN  </P> <P> Fullerton has joined the list of cities interested in a proposed monorail  system that would link major shopping, entertainment and business centers in  the county.  </P> <P> City officials will join others from Santa Ana, Orange, Irvine, Costa Mesa and  Anaheim at a meeting next month to discuss the monorail, Mayor A.B. (Buck)  Catlin said.  </P> <P> "I would say (Fullerton) definitely should be one of the northern terminals" of  the monorail line, Catlin said. "Fullerton is very much a hub city in North  County."  </P> <P> As now envisioned, the backbone of the system would be a single-line, raised  monorail capable of carrying cars about 60 m.p.h. along a route from Irvine  through Costa Mesa, Santa Ana and Orange, ending in Anaheim. Lower-speed  monorails would branch off the main line to ferry passengers to locations east  and west.  </P> <P> The network would link John Wayne Airport and the sprawling Irvine Spectrum  office and industrial complex to sites including South Coast Plaza, Disneyland,  Anaheim Stadium, MainPlace shopping mall and the Santa Ana Civic Center.  </P> <P> Fullerton's participation would take the network farther north, possibly  including links with Cal State Fullerton and the city's Amtrak depot.  </P> <P> Catlin said Fullerton attracts 50,000 students at five colleges and  universities annually, and the train depot is the busiest between San Diego and  Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The system, which would be the first commercially operated public monorail in  the country, could be built along existing streets, requiring the purchase of  little or no private property, officials have said. Catlin said that  Fullerton's leg of the system could be funded by public grants and money from  private redevelopment projects.  </P> <P> Leaders of the other five cities agreed earlier this month to unite in pushing  for the system. Officials of the cities promised to work toward issuing a joint  request early next year for proposals from private firms that might be willing  to build and operate the system.  </P> <P> Mayor Larry Agran of Irvine called Fullerton's tentative participation  "terrific."  </P> <P> "It's evidence of the readiness of cities to build a system that will relieve  our dependence on the private automobile." Agran said. TED JOHNSON  </P></p>

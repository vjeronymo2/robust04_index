			<p>BFN     [Text] Palestinian National Authority Member Dr. Riyad  al-Za'nun has stated that the attainment of security stability  in the self-rule areas and the issue of development are two of  the authority's priorities in the forthcoming stage.    In statements published in Cairo yesterday, brother Riyad  al-Za'nun said that the issue of settlements and settlers is  part of the strategy of the Israeli occupation, which seeks to  create facts on the ground that hamper the peace process.    He emphasized the importance of the democratic option and  said that pluralism and respect for other parties' opinions is  the chosen course for the Palestinian's in the next stage.    Brother Riyad al-Za'nun also criticized the Israeli campaign  against the Palestinian command's decision to reactivate the  laws that were in force before June 1967. He said: It is  inconceivable for the Palestinian Authority to maintain the  Israeli laws.</p>

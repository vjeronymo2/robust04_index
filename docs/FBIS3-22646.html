In  January, only 10 Sakhalin residents caught the dangerous  infection. Enough vaccines and serums have been brought into  the oblast for the treatment and prevention of diphtheria. To  combat it, the oblast administration has set up a special  operational headquarters and has allocated foreign currency for  the acquisition of medicines.    An ITAR-TASS correspondent was told by the head of the  health  administration of the oblast, Aleksandr Moshenskiy, that most  probably the local internal affairs administration's corrective  labor institutions were the source of infection; nearly  one-third of sufferers are located in the labor colonies.</p>

(``NYSE''` or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Exchange Rule 96 currently prohibits a member registered as a Competitive Trader <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  or Registered Competitive Market Maker (``RCMM'') <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  from initiating, while on the Floor of the Exchange, the purchase or sale, for his own account or his member organization's account, of any stock in which he has an option position, or in which he knows his firm has an option position. Rule 96 currently applies to all options, including those traded on a national securities exchange (``listed options''). The proposed rule change would remove the prohibition in Rule 96 as to listed options. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> A Competitive Trader is a NYSE member who is authorized to initiate proprietary transactions on the Floor of the Exchange but who is not registered as a specialist, odd-lot dealer or Registered Competitive Market Maker. See NYSE Rules 111 &amp; 112(e). Competitive Traders exist pursuant to, and must comply with the requirements of, Section 11(a)(1)(G) of the Act. See also SEC Rule 11a1&hyph;1(T). In addition, the NYSE requires that 75 percent of a Competitive Trader's monthly transactions must be stabilizing transactions under the tick-test. See NYSE Rule 112(d). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> A RCMM is a NYSE member who is authorized to initiate proprietary transactions on the Floor of the Exchange. See NYSE Rule 107. RCMMs are not subject to the same tick-test as Competitive Traders; however, they must comply with a complex series of rules about the price at which they can trade and the size of those trades.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Id.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Unlike Competitive Traders, RCMMs have an affirmative obligation to maintain a fair and orderly market.

Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Purpose <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Rule 96 was adopted in the mid-1930's after extensive investigations and public hearings by the Commission concerning manipulative practices and ``pool'' operations involving the use of options. At present, Rule 96 prohibits a member registered as a Competitive Trader or RCMM from initiating, while on the Floor, the purchase or sale, for his own account or his member organization's account, of any stock in which he has an option position, or in which he knows his firm has an option position. Rule 96 does not prohibit a Competitive Trader or RCMM from trading in options; rather, the rule simply provides that such members may not initiate a proprietary trade in a stock on the Floor where they have an option position in the stock. Rule 96 currently applies to all options, including those traded over-the-counter (``OTC options``) and listed options. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of the proposed rule change is to remove the prohibition in Rule 96 as to listed options. Thus, under the proposed rule change, a Competitive Trader or RCMM would be permitted to initiate a proprietary purchase or sale of stock on the Floor where he has a listed option position in that stock, but not where he has an OTC option position in that stock. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is appropriate for three reasons: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) By removing a restraint on members' initiating transactions on the Floor, the proposed rule change can be expected to add to the depth and liquidity of the Exchange market. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Listed options are substantially different from the OTC options which Rule 96 was originally intended to regulate, and any regulatory concerns that might arise as to listed options can be addressed by monitoring and surveillance of revised Rule 96. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The proposed rule change will remove a competitive barrier to fair competition, since no other professionals are subject to comparable restrictions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / International Company News: Taiwan's future lies a strait away - Business with China is under new pressures MR Winston Yang, like his father, billionaire Formosa Plastics chairman, YC Wang, has strong views about the need for Taiwanese business to spread its wings to the mainland. 'We will have to go to China. In my opinion our future direction is mainland China. We have to be close to our customers,' says Mr Wang, 42, who heads Nan Ya Plastics Corporation, the biggest company in the Formosa Plastics group, Taiwan's biggest conglomerate. His views are typical of those held by Taiwanese business, which is growing impatient at the brakes placed by the nervous authorities on commercial links with the mainland. These restrictions include a block on bank lending for projects in China, restraint on raising money on the equity markets for investment across the Taiwan strait and a requirement that permission be sought for certain categories of investment. Taiwan's rulers worry that if all restrictions are lifted, including permission for direct trade and travel, a business exodus would accelerate, draining investment away from Taiwan itself and jeopardising the island's future prosperity and weakening it politically. Mr Wang Jr, however, is adamant that if business is to continue to expand, it must relocate some of its operations to its largest market. This is partly, he says, because the business environment in Taiwan itself is becoming less convivial as the costs of land and labour rise steeply. Environmental groups are also increasingly assertive, holding up key projects like a nuclear power plant and Formosa Plastics' own Dollars 7.6bn plans to build a sixth naptha cracking plant and associated petrochemical facilities. 'Taiwan industry is at a crossroads,' says Mr Wang. 'Problems include lack of investment incentives, not to mention the highest cost of industrial land in the world today, even higher than Japan.' Citing pressure from what he described as a 'local mafia', Mr Wang said Formosa Plastics' naptha plant had been held up for six years while argument raged about environmental and other aspects of the project. While big business in Taiwan considers its strategy across the Taiwan strait and pressures the government to ease restrictions, smaller enterprises have wasted little time in seizing the opportunity. By the end of 1992, Taiwanese businessmen had committed some Dollars 8.5bn in investment, and actual direct utilised investment had reached Dollars 1.9bn. Some 8,000 to 10,000 projects had been established with Taiwanese involvement, the vast bulk of them small and medium-size enterprises. Average investment totalled about Dollars 1m. Mr Wang is planning a substantial investment in southern China, perhaps in the order of Dollars 200m, in a plant to produce a range of Nan Ya Plastics' staple items, including PVC and polyester products for use in manufacturing consumer goods such as handbags, shoes and apparel. 'Our customers are asking Nan Ya to set up factories in China,' said Mr Wang. 'There is a definite economic advantage for us to invest in the mainland. It would cut delivery times for our products, bearing in mind that the fashion business changes very quickly. If there is a market, you must go the market,' he adds. Nan Ya is being drawn inexorably towards investment in the mainland by the spectacular increase in its China business. Six years ago it was exporting 10 per cent of its products across the Taiwan strait. Now, exports to China have reached 60 per cent of its total production. Among Mr Wang's chief complaints is the additional cost of shipping to China through Hong Kong to satisfy the continued ban on direct trade with China. He estimates that for each standard 17-tonne 20 ft container, additional shipping and handling charges amount to about Dollars 700. Nan Ya ships about 50,000 tonnes of product to China annually. Mr Wang sees his company's future and the manufacturing future for Taiwan itself in the higher value-added items, while labour-intensive industries move across the Taiwan strait. The arithmetic here would seem compelling. Wages in Taiwan for the average skilled worker amount to between Dollars 1,500 and Dollars 2,000 per month, compared with Dollars 40 per month on the mainland. In line with these imperatives, Formosa Plastics, in its latest annual report, made no secret of its belief that the mainland offered the best prospects for growth. Interestingly, the company chairman Y. C. Wang used the report to press the case politically for a lessening of restrictions on investment in the mainland. His remarks make interesting reading, especially in light of what is seen as the enormous potential economic strength of greater China, including Taiwan, Hong Kong and the mainland itself. Arguing for investing in China rather than other economies in south-east Asia, Mr Yang wrote: 'The first advantage for investment in mainland China is its deep-rooted nationalism system. Contained in nationalism is very little worry of misappropriation of the incoming investor's management technologies. 'The second is the historical anti-overseas Chinese events that would be avoided in the Chinese mainland. If private market reform would prevail one day, along with the burgeoning of entrepeneurship which would entail free competition.' Mr Yang added: 'The mainland territory would offer a fabulous potential to accommodate many competitors.' Formosa Plastics clearly intends to be among these enterprises jostling for a share of the world's largest potential market, whether Taipei likes it or not.  -------------------------------------------------------------------             TAIWAN'S FOREIGN INVESTMENT (USDollars m)  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Country        1990      1991       1992*     1993**     1994** Asia          602.9     929.6      306.2     400.0      500.0 China         300.0     900.0    2,000.0   2,500.0    3,000.0 US            428.7     297.8      257.6     250.0      250.0 Europe        265.9     350.2      427.9     450.0      430.0 Others        254.7      78.4       46.6     100.0      120.0 Total       1,852.2   2,556.0    3,038.3   3,700.0    4,300.0  ------------------------------------------------------------------- * estimate ** forecast  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Ministry of Economic Affairs  -------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

His comments came as North Atlantic Treaty Organization  leaders, meeting at a summit in Brussels, discussed the  possibility of renewing their threat of air strikes, originally  made last year.    In a statement to the Bosnian Serb SRNA news agency, he  warned against an "anti-Serb resolution" by NATO, saying that  air strikes would only create "new difficulties." In particular  he said that if NATO agreed to any resolution "against the  Serbs" they would be forced to review territorial offers to  Bosnian Moslems -- a key factor in the overall peace settlement.    "We offered 33.3 percent of the territory of  Bosnia-Herzegovina to the Moslems, and accepted under certain  conditions that Sarajevo be put under UN administration," he  said. Karadzic said that, of the three warring sides, Bosnian  Serbs had "proved to be the most cooperative."    He once again blamed the international community for the  crisis in former Yugoslavia, saying it "would do nothing but  continue its series of mistakes" if it continued to press its  "anti-Serb" policies.</p>

			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Survey of The European Single Market (4): It really worked / Interview with Lord Cockfield, market mastermind LORD COCKFIELD, the crusty British peer who was European commissioner for the internal market from 1984 to 1988, is in the satisfying position of seeing a vision turned into reality. 'The single market is almost exactly as envisaged,' he says, 'except for minor flaws, such as the remaining frontier controls over people, and the fact that the financial sector reforms are not as liberal as I would have liked.' Lord Cockfield's stint in Brussels coincided with a number of milestones in the single market process. His biggest achievement was the 1985 European Commission White Paper and its nearly 300 legislative proposals setting out the framework for the market. His great strength, according to observers at the time, was writing the paper in a way which gave national politicians a clear and logical blueprint for building the market. His experience as a commissioner of Inland Revenue in Britain gave him the ability to find ways through thorny and highly technical tax issues requiring unanimous agreement by all 12 member states. As a salesman for the programme, however, Lord Cockfield was less adept. He rarely ventured forth to national capitals to lobby ministers, preferring instead to stay in Brussels and to make his points at Council meetings He did, however, ask Mr Paolo Cecchini, a senior Commission official, to oversee the compilation of what became the landmark report on the proposed market. It stands as one of the largest pieces of market research ever conducted. Especially in view of its rosy economic forecasts and commercial scenarios, many economists came to view it mainly as a propaganda exercise to sell the White Paper proposals. But the report, published in 1988, set off a flurry of corporate strategic reviews. The economic buoyancy of 1986-90 - when EC economies registered average annual growth rates of 3.2 per cent - made it easier for politicians to accept those parts of the programme curbing national monopolies or initiating painful industrial restructuring. 'An economic downturn three or four years ago and it could have been another story,' he concedes. A former trade secretary in Mrs Thatcher's government in the early 1980s, Lord Cockfield shied away from harmonisation of standards as the main way of overcoming national regulatory differences in European industries, favouring instead mutual recognition and market-oriented solutions. His belief in the power of market forces is undiminished, as is his conviction that the imperfections in today's market will soon disappear. 'Once we get rid of frontier controls and major nationalistic impulses, such as public procurement, then the forces of trade and the market will wash away the remaining barriers,' he says. However, he does not make light of the challenges in making the market work. 'The single market is in the bag. But we may have to deal with new barriers.' Lord Cockfield is a harsh critic of British government policy towards the European Community in general, and the single market in particular. He takes issue with politicians who promote the single market as an alternative to the far wider concept of European economic and political union. 'The UK government had little real understanding of what the single market meant,' he says. 'The original concept was that the single market would be the foundation on which we would build economic unity . . . the market is not the end of the road, but a road that leads somewhere, to economic union. It's just a pity that the economic agenda was not completed before work began on political union.' He says that the objective of a single European currency was enshrined for the first time in the Single European Act. He regrets the emotions surrounding the currency issue - one of the most controversial points in the debate over the Maastricht treaty. 'The single market is an enormous benefit and the single currency would have produced a large add-on benefit.' In view of the difficulties of keeping to the Maastricht monetary union timetable, he believes there is a good chance that Europe's single currency will turn out to be not the Ecu, but the D-Mark.</p>

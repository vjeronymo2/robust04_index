			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / Observer: Power player When it comes to finding new jobs, Maurice Strong seems to be something of a masochist. The energetic Canadian who struggled to give focus to the over- ambitious Earth Summit in Rio last June is now returning home to take the reins of Ontario Hydro, one of North America's biggest (and most troubled) power utilities. His 20-year involvement with international environmental issues contrasts with a chequered career in Canada. In the 1970s, he was close to ex-premier Pierre Trudeau who made him the first chairman of the national energy company, Petro-Canada. But a bid to enter national politics was aborted after one of Strong's outside businesses ran into trouble. His versatile experience should have forearmed him for the turbulence at Ontario Hydro. The government-owned utility, one of North America's heaviest offshore borrowers, has been stretched to the limit by cost overruns and technical problems at its nuclear power stations. Its electricity rates have been pushed up by almost 20 per cent in the past two years. There's not much doubt which way Strong will be leaning when he has to choose between the environment and the bottom line.</p>

			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / International Company News: Strong yen forces Toyota Motor profits down 24% TOYOTA MOTOR, Japan's largest carmaker, yesterday announced a 24 per cent decline in pre-tax profits for the year ended June, and said the yen's appreciation could threaten its policy of lifetime employment. In its third consecutive year of profit decline, Toyota pre-tax profits fell to Y286.4bn (Dollars 2.76bn) and operating profits to Y103.6bn from Y124.9bn. The results were the lowest since the Toyota group merged its manufacturing and sales operations into a single company in 1982. Sales were Y9,031bn, up from a previous Y8,940bn. Toyota blamed the downturn on weak domestic demand as well as currency strength. Earlier this week Honda reported a 42 per cent fall in profits for its first quarter. Toyota warned that at an exchange rate of Y110 to the dollar it would be hard-pressed to make any profit at all. If the exchange rate remained closer to Y105 to the dollar, Toyota would find itself in a very difficult situation, the company said. It added that the outlook was not significantly better. While the government's economic stimulus package was expected to help lift consumer demand in Japan, fierce competition and the uncertainty of recovery in world markets kept a cloud over future prospects, the company said. In the current year to June 1994, Toyota is forecasting a 30 per cent decline in pre-tax profits to Y200bn and a 29 per cent fall in net income to Y110bn on sales 3.7 per cent down at Y8,700bn. These projections are based on an average exchange rate of Y110 to the dollar, the company said. Unit sales in Japan suffered a drop of 7.6 per cent to 2.16m units. Exports in the year rose 1.6 per cent to 1.72m units, largely on increased exports to Asia. Production of passenger cars and trucks in Japan was down by 4.4 per cent while production overseas increased 20 per cent. On a consolidated basis, Toyota sales were Y10,210bn and pre-tax profits were Y322.2bn, down 24.6 per cent.</p>

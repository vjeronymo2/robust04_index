			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Leading Article: Man bites watchdog When a securities watchdog declares that the regulatory system is operating pretty well and requires no substantial remedial treatment, it comes as something of a surprise. When the regulator in question is the US Securities and Exchange Commission, a watchdog whose genetic make-up carries more than a hint of the bloodhound about it, the response is more one of shock. It is, in the argot of the Fourth Estate, a cross between a non-story and a man-bites-dog story. Expectations have been confounded by the SEC's Market 2000 Report, which was finally published on Thursday after a year and a half's gestation. With US equities reaching levels that prompt discussion of bubbles and crashes both on Wall Street and elsewhere, market hubris might appear to have infected the SEC's Division of Market Regulation. Just as the 1987 Crash spawned serious worries about the impact of derivatives trading on equity prices, a Crash of '94 or '95 would surely reveal some other cause for regulatory concern. That, after all, is the history of financial regulation: deregulation followed by reregulation, in a perpetual rhythm that follows the ebb and flow of the market tide. Before writing off the report as a gigantic hostage to stock market fortune, however, it is worth putting scepticism to one side and asking whether there might not be a case for insouciance. The most hard-headed argument could be that in an increasingly global market the fall-out from a collapse on Wall Street would be felt more severely everywhere else. Less enthusiastic watchdogs in less developed markets could well be at greater risk than the SEC. This is because the old adage about America sneezing and the rest of the world catching a cold applies with unprecedented force to today's markets. Emerging markets The striking feature of the present economic cycle is that the capital markets have hijacked the normal functions of the banking system. The penalty for holding cash in the US, where short-term interest rates are at their lowest for 30 years, is such that savers have rushed into mutual funds and other forms of investment which, unlike bank deposits, involve market risk. As Wall Street has looked increasingly expensive to fund managers, they have diversified into foreign markets. And the benefits of such diversification are particularly marked in emerging markets, where corporate performance operates much more independently of the US cycle than in the OECD area. Looked at from an American perspective, the investment in emerging markets is small in relation to the total institutional portfolio. The outflow is much less worrying than in the case of banking flows to the Third World in the 1970s and early 1980s, because mutual funds and pension funds do not operate on a slender base of capital; they are ungeared institutions, and any loss from falling markets falls not on the institution itself but on individuals and, in the case of defined benefit pension schemes after a long time lag, on companies. And whereas the Third World banking flows were as much a response to regulatory restrictions at home as to carefully assessed opportunities abroad, the present equity flows are based on more straightforward judgments about risk and relative return. Healthy correction A US securities watchdog could thus take the view that, if a rise in US interest rates causes some repatriation of funds as stock markets fall, this will be no more than a healthy correction at home, even if it causes an earthquake in several Asian and Latin American economies. The position would be analogous to the Japanese banks' stampede into property markets in the US, Britain and Australia, at the peak of the real estate bubble in the late 1980s. The banking authorities in the English-speaking world took a complacent view because the fall-out from the more imprudent Japanese lending would do most damage to the capital base of the Japanese banking system. That said, globalisation poses new problems for securities regulators, just as it does for monetary policy. If the specific, albeit minor, rule changes in the Market 2000 report nonetheless appear onerous to investment institutions and companies, they will go offshore. The history of the Euromarkets is all about the impact of different relative levels of regulation on the location of financial activity. Capital gravitates naturally to those financial centres where the fiscal and regulatory hurdles are easiest to overcome. The other snag for today's securities watchdogs is that values in the political market place are very different from those in financial markets. It may matter little in economic terms if US private investors come unstuck in junk bonds in Latin America. But if enough people are hurt it could become politically sensitive and rebound on the SEC. The learning curve in cross-border investment is long and arduous, as some of the world's most sophisticated banks have recently found to their cost. Market 2000 still looks a mite too complacent.</p>

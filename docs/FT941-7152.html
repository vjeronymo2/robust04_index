			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Survey of Kuwait (5): Over-protected species - Banks One of the more archaic laws in Kuwait's commercial code is a three-year suspension of trading in shares of any company, including banks, that wants to merge while listed on Kuwait's stock exchange, writes Robin Allen. To be fair, this law - and a separate one which specifically bars banks from merging - is due to be repealed. According to Mr Ismail al-Shatti, the head of the national assembly's finance committee, the bills have passed the committee stage. Merging, in Kuwait's over-banked stock market, is possibly the only way for the weaker members of the banking community to regenerate themselves. That was the thrust of the message delivered at a seminar last November by Mr Yousef al-Awadi, general manager of the London-based Kuwait Investment Office. 'The time has come for some of the banks' shareholders and management to forego ...short-term self-interest and instead focus on the long-term corporate survival of their organisations.' The only way to cut costs was to get rid of redundant employees and branches, he said. His argument has widespread support. The biggest problem confronting the banks' domestic sector is now a simple lack of opportunities rather than the Souk al-Manakh debt burden of previous years. This was eased with the government's purchase in August 1992 of almost Dollars 20bn worth of private sector indebtedness in return for debt bonds. The case for having fewer banks is unassailable. The domestic market is flat with lending opportunities confined to some trade financing, guarantees and working capital. Central Bank figures for last October show that the total assets of the nine commercial and specialised banks was down from the previous year, at KD8.5bn (Dollars 28.5bn) compared with KD8.94bn at the end of October 1992. The only growth prospect is consumer finance among Kuwait's 1.6m population. Here it is very competitive, with two banks, National Bank of Kuwait and Gulf Bank, leading the pack. The six commercial banks are of widely varying quality in what is often seen as a three or four-tiered banking system. National Bank of Kuwait is in a league of its own in terms of strength of capital and reserves, and a quality management allowed to get on with the job by a hands-off board and shareholders who have put in place a coherent strategy for the management to target. It is the only Kuwaiti bank of real international calibre, retaining the largest international presence and holding more than 40 per cent of all Kuwait's bank deposits. Its 1993 results further strengthened its lead. Net profits were up 23 per cent to KD52m (Dollars 175m), almost three times the level of its nearest rival, Gulf Bank. NBK's total assets were up 28.4 per cent at KD3.3bn, and the bank maintained a capital to risks ratio of more than 20 per cent. The second tier would consist of Gulf Bank - and some would say Burgan Bank as well, though Cyprus-based analyst Capital Intelligence says that 'while NBK is in a class of its own, Gulf Bank is better positioned for success than any of its peers'. Burgan Bank is more of a state-owned institution with the government owning a majority of the shares. Capital Intelligence last summer raised Gulf Bank's long-term rating from BBB+ to A on the strength of its 1992 results. The 1993 figures released on February 9 have vindicated CI's assessment. Gulf Bank increased 1993 profits by 22 per cent to KD18.2m (Dollars 61.1m) compared with the previous year. Total assets were up 7 per cent to KD1.25bn (Dollars 4.2bn), of which some half was in government debt bonds; cash, short-term funds and treasury bills 30 per cent; loans and advances just under 20 per cent. These last were up 47 per cent to KD237m, mostly from international lending. Any increase in domestic lending was at the expense of the other four commercial banks. The three banks most frequently mentioned as 'merger candidates' are Al-Ahli, Bank of Kuwait &amp; the Middle East, and Commercial Bank of Kuwait. Although the government is a majority shareholder of both Burgan and BKME, the central bank governor Sheikh Salem al-Sabah made clear in a February 9 interview that he would not force banks to merge. Any decision of this nature, he said, would have to be taken by their boards. The prospect of finding a foreign partner is remote. Foreign banks are unlikely to put their feet into Kuwait's stagnant waters even if a proposal to let foreign companies acquire up to 40 per cent of Kuwaiti companies were to be approved by the national assembly. Judging by the emotional response to this issue in a debate on February 9, it will be a long time before Kuwait's parliament comes near to approving such an idea.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Kohei Murayama] </F>   [Text] Washington, April 24 KYODO -- A reaffirmed accord  by the Group of Seven (G-7) industrialized nations on  stabilizing exchange rates reflects Japan's concern over the  adverse economic effects of currency volatility, Japanese  Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii said Sunday.    "I expressed my view that unstable rates will have  undesirable effects on the stock and bond markets and cool off  business sentiment to put a damper on the economy," Fujii told a  press conference after a meeting of G-7 finance ministers and  central bankers.    Fujii said the G-7 financial leaders reconfirmed their past  accord to closely cooperate to realize stable currency rates  reflecting economic fundamentals. "The stronger growth nations  were referred to as the United States, Canada, and Britain, and  the weaker nations as Japan and other G-7 nations." Fujii said.    Fujii said he described the state of Japan's economy as  "still generally sluggish," but stressed that the February 15.25  trillion yen economic package will help Japan attain a  full-fledged recovery.    Fujii also said that he explained that the Japanese ruling  coalition parties agreed to implement multi-year income tax cuts  in a policy accord agreed last Friday on forming a new cabinet.    On the current account surplus, Fujii said, "the trend has  clearly reversed," citing the change in the effects of external  demand on Japan's economic growth.    External demand pushed down Japan's real gross domestic  product (GDP) by 0.3 percentage point, while domestic demand  boosted it by 0.4 point to attain a 0.1 percent growth in fiscal  1993 that ended March 31, Fujii said.</p>

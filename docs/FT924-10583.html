			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / Britain's top 10 forecasters: The FT ranks the performance of leading economists during the recession 1 - Paul Turnbull UK economist Smith New Court Has closely monitored the housing boom and subsequent slump. Long-term term opponent of UK membership of exchange rate mechanism; wrote in October 1990, three weeks after Britain joined, of 'dominant risk' of base rates being kept high due to ERM constraint. Little known outside City, where he has worked for nearly 15 years. Has few fans in the Treasury. Two months ago had chance to explain his often trenchant views to Alan Budd, Treasury chief economic adviser, over private lunch, the first meeting between the two. 2 - Leo Doyle econometrician Kleinwort Benson Computer wizard-cum-economist whose job prior to joining Kleinwort investment group was a floor cleaner in a psychiatric hospital in Sussex. Kleinwort's forecasts use a computerised economic model devised by Doyle. Based on Treasury software, the model takes in extra data on company debts and housing market. Stays in the background at Kleinwort, where recently arrived Peter Spencer is chief economist and David Owen the main UK economist. Surprisingly, the Treasury has yet to contact him about his model. 3 - Keith Wade chief economist Schroders Low-profile economist whose views are little circulated outside circle of Schroders' clients. Has worked on UK economy at Schroders for past four years, initially with Schroders' former chief economist Donald Franklin - now at Treasury where he works not on forecasts but financial services regulation. Wrote with Franklin in autumn of 1990 of danger of global economic slowdown and sugested chancellor 'may have left it too late to prevent a prolonged recession'. Worked with Alan Budd when they were both at London Business School. 4 - Patrick Minford economics professor Liverpool University Vehemently anti-ERM and free-market economist. Long disregarded in Treasury for what have been held to be unsound views. Leading member of 'Liverpool Six' group of monetarist economists arguing since early 1991 that recession would be protracted. Says Treasury should have taken more notice early on of impact of high real interest rates. Wrote - one month after Britain joined ERM - that devaluation 'seemed inevitable'. Now says 'the Treasury should come clean and admit it made a hash of things'. 5 - Peter Warburton UK economist Robert Fleming Deep thinker, another member of Liverpool Six group, has been extremely gloomy about economy since 1990, arguing that weak balance sheets of companies and large consumer debts would impede growth. On good terms with Alan Budd; both worked at London Business School. Stopped using computer models of economy three years ago on ground that they gave wrong results. Thinks Treasury is too enclosed. Wrote in October 1990 that the economy was 'hamstrung' because of corporate and consumer overborrowing. 6 - Richard Freeman chief economist ICI Outgoing Australian, worked in Treasury before joining Britain's biggest manufacturing company. Good contacts in industry, receives up-to-the-minute information on sales and prospects in all ICI divisions, ranging from paints to fertiliser. Forecasts not widely circulated, writes detailed report every month on world economy to ICI board. Told ICI directors two years ago of 'big risk' of world recession. Generally gloomy about international outlook ever since. Key member of informal Treasury panel advising government forecasters about demand in industry. 7 - Gavyn Davies chief UK economist Goldman Sachs On most counts, Britain's best known economist. Was sounded out last year by Mr Lamont for post of Treasury chief economic adviser; decided against a move. With colleague David Walton, quick to change Goldman's monthly forecasts. Not immune to mistakes: incorrectly predicted recovery a year ago. Thinks criticism of Treasury has been overdone. He says: 'If I was to choose two people I would rely on for giving policy advice on the economy then Terry Burns (Treasury permanent secretary) and Alan Budd would be very high on my list.' 8 - Tim Congdon head of Lombard Street Research Sometimes irrascible but respected monetarist with good track record in recent years in predicting economic slowdown. Another member of Liverpool Six, runs his own research group. Wrote in January 1991 of 'nightmarish' future for Britain with 'severe recession' made worse by ERM constraints. Says top Treasury officials 'have had too many chances' over wrong economic decisions and would like to see fresh blood. Thinks Treasury team of Burns and Budd in particular failed to draw lessons from previous boom-bust episodes. 8 - Michael Saunders UK economist Salomon Brothers Up and coming, youthful City star, more original than most economists and particularly good with figures on public-sector borrowing. Poached by Salomon from gilts broker Greenwell Montagu two years ago. Has warned for past year of long slowdown. Said two years ago that economy would continue to weaken during 1991, 'with little prospect of rapid turnround' due to high real interest rates across Europe and substantial cuts in stocks and fixed investment. Says that government PSBR forecasts are over-optimistic. 10 - Bill Martin chief UK economist UBS Phillips and Drew Feisty self-publicist; fourth member of Liverpool Six to make the FT's Top 10; the other two, Alan Walters and Gordon Pepper, do not make formal forecasts. Fierce opponent of ERM; views little taken into account by Treasury. Has called Treasury projections 'moonshine'. Warned in November 1990 of dangers of 'deepening recession and further political trauma' arising out of high interest rates and a slide in sterling. Said two years ago that the government's promise of 'pain first, pleasure later (as a result of ERM entry) appears impossibly optimistic'.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Letter to the editor from Zatulin: "I am not Bismarck, </F> but..."] It is said that the average Frenchwoman can make three  things out of any material on hand: a hat, an umbrella, and a  tragedy. It was with interest that I acquainted myself with the  attempt by Igor Rotar to present my views on the near abroad  ("Become Our Satellites or Perish" in NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, 5 May  of this year). It seems to me that this is a contemporary  variant of how with the aid of uncomplicated tricks,  misrepresentation, double entente, and rearrangement of words  coming from me, direct speech under the heading of "Revelations"  is transformed by a foreign correspondent into a tragedy or an  Ems dispatch.    At one time in editing an innocent text of a dispatch  Bismarck precipitated the Franco-Prussian War. Naturally I  cannot claim to be Bismarck or someone as important as he, but I  categorically object against the situation where I. Rotar,  acting as a guide and interpreter for his Japanese colleague at  the meeting some month-and-a-half ago, now becomes wise at my  expense, juggling the text which I have never seen.    Such an interest manifests itself particularly in the way in  which the question regarding Tajikistan is posed and the manner  in which the correspondent patiently coaches "my" reply, sharing  wisdom and truth. But unfortunately he cannot get an intelligent  answer from his slow-witted interlocutor as to which is better:  have one's head torn off or go on vacation.    On the eve of Victory Day it is worth noting the fact that  the word satellite in the newest Russian philology has a  pejorative connotation which the word ally does not have at all  and the author undoubtedly must know that. I leave "my  revelations" of the type: "A small country must be happy that it  is within the sphere of influence of a big power," as well as  the abundance of military field terminology (such as "winning",  "dying," etc.) on his conscience." I think that Russia, just as  the USA and the entire world community, is not indifferent to  the observance of the rights of an individual and not only a  Russian one and not just in the YuAR [Republic of South Africa]  but in the CIS as well.    The topics touched upon in this piece constitute material  for  a long article and not a brief comment. I will limit myself to  the observation that CIS countries are not bowling pins and  Russian journalists, in the intervals between representation of  foreign professional interests, should not attempt to place all  of those in the Duma in moulds of Vladimir Volfovich  [Zhirinovskiy], even if they have been stored up for use in  future articles.    Respectfully,  Signed Konstantin Zatulin, 6 May 1994    [From NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA Editor] We are publishing the  letter from Mr. Zatulin, but because of the conflicting  situation that developed the editorial office will now be forced  to carefully compare the text of the taped interview with what  was published in the NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA and then return to this  topic. The editorial office, however, is certain that Mr. Rotar  does not speak either Japanese or English and therefore could  not have been "an interpreter for a Japanese colleague" as  asserted by Mr. Zatulin. Nevertheless the editorial office is  also entertaining those premises of Mr. Zatulin which are  illegitimate.</p>

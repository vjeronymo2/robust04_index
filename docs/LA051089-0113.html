Knowlton will be held at 7 tonight at Pacific View  Memorial Park, 3500 Pacific View Drive, Newport Beach.

While timing himself under water with a wristwatch, Knowlton  apparently lost consciousness. He was taken to Friendly Hills Regional Medical  Center in La Habra, where he died Sunday morning.  </P> <P> Jim Knowlton said later that his brother, an automotive parts manager, was "a  really competitive person" who liked to scuba dive at Santa Catalina Island,  ride mountain bikes and ski. He said his brother always carried a piece of  paper with words by Albert Einstein that read, "Try not to be a man of success  but a man of value."  </P></p>

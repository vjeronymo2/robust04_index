General Kat Liebenberg stated yesterday in Pretoria that the  Defense Forces are apolitical and do not belong to either the  National Party, the Conservative Party or any other party or  movement.    During a spectacular parade at Voortrekkerhoogte of a  brigade  of soldiers belonging to the four separate Defense Force  services, with several overflights, parachute jumps and a canon  salute, Gen. Liebenberg handed over the command of the South  African Defense Forces (SADF) to Lieutenant General Georg  Meiring.    "The structure and culture of the Defense Forces do not  allow  for such dissension," said Gen. Liebenberg.    The parade was attended by, among others, General Constand  Viljoen, a former head of the Defense Forces and currently one  of the leaders of the Afrikaner National Front (AVF).    Yesterday, the AVF called on its supporters to fight to  achieve self-determination.    Following the parade, Gen. Viljoen said that he hoped that  South Africa would never reach the point where the SADF is given  the task to take action against the right wingers.    Gen. Liebenberg asked politicians and the media to respect  and uphold the apolitical character of the SADF as an  institution and the soldier in uniform for their own sake and  that of the country's.    He warned organizations, institutions and individuals who  are  striving to chip away at and besmirch the SADF that they may yet  have to rely on those forces for their protection and security,  their own survival and the orderly survival of the country.    In addition, he also warned that the SADF and the defense  industries have already been cut to the bone by far reaching  cuts and rationalization.    "If more cuts are implemented, then the nerves will be bared  to the core, with disastrous consequences."    He also pleaded that standards must be maintained within the  SADF and that the SADF must always hang on to its professional  nature.    "The situation cannot be allowed where someone who exercises  command over the lives of soldiers would not be adequately  trained or adequately qualified or lack the necessary experience  and military knowledge."    Gen. Lieberberg also pleaded for the maintenance of  part-time  forces. "Whatever changes may occur in the new system, the  part-time forces may never be allowed to become the stepchildren  of the Defense Forces," he said.    The parade was also attended by other politicians. Mr. Kobie  Coetsee, minister of defense, was present as well as Mr. Hernus  Kriel, minister of law and order, who initially sat next to Gen.  Viljoen before taking his place on the front honor seats.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 48. One comment objected, in part, to proposed &sect;314.94(a)(12)(vi), which would require an ANDA applicant to provide a patent certification in response to an untimely submission of patent information if the ANDA was submitted after the untimely submission of patent information or did not contain an appropriate patent certification at the time the patent information was submitted. The comment correctly noted that FDA may refuse to approve or may even withdraw approval of an application for failure to submit patent information (see section 505 (d)(6) and (e)(4) of the act). The comment said these sanctions emphasize the importance of filing patent information, and FDA ``should not provide any benefit to the NDA applicant who ignores the statutory requirement for timely submission of such information.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 314.94(a)(12)(vi) is intended to effectuate Congress' intent to enforce timely submission of patent information. As discussed more fully in the response to comment 7 above, FDA believes a less severe sanction than the withdrawal of NDA approval for late submission of patent information would ordinarily effectuate congressional intent. For the reasons discussed in response to comment 7 FDA has concluded that if an NDA applicant submits required patent information on an approved drug product more than 30 days after issuance of the patent, the agency will publish the untimely information but will not require ANDA applicants with pending applications who have previously submitted a certification that was correct at the time it was submitted, i.e., those applicants who would be prejudiced by the late submission, to recertify as to the new patent. Applicants who initially submit ANDA's after the submission of the patent information or whose pending applications do not contain a valid certification at the time of the submission would be required to submit a certification as to that patent. The agency, therefore, declines to revise this provision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA also notes that, if an ANDA applicant with a pending application voluntarily makes a patent certification for an untimely filed patent, the ANDA applicant may withdraw the patent certification for the untimely filed patent. The agency, on its own initiative, has amended &sect;314.94(a)(12)(viii) to make this clear. Additionally, if the patent certification for the untimely filed patent was a paragraph IV certification (claiming that the patent is invalid or would not be infringed), the agency would not consider the withdrawn paragraph IV certification to preclude FDA from granting 180-day exclusivity to another ANDA applicant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 49. Proposed &sect;314.94(a)(12)(vii) would permit an ANDA applicant to seek confirmation of the correctness of patent information, but would also require an ANDA applicant to submit the appropriate patent certification if the disputed patent information was not amended or withdrawn. One comment suggested amending proposed &sect;314.94(a)(12)(vii) to declare the end of the error correction process for patent information to be final agency action. The comment explained that this section permits challenges to listed patents but, in conjunction with proposed &sect;314.53(f), neglects to contain a process to require patent owners to withdraw or modify patent listings. The comment said that declaring the end of the error correction process to be final agency action would enable ANDA applicants to seek judicial review rather than wait for the patent owner to voluntarily correct the patent information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA disagrees with the comment. Disputes between ANDA applicants and patent holders regarding the validity or correctness of the listed patent information must be resolved among the ANDA applicants and the patent holders rather than by agency action. FDA stated this position in the preamble to the proposed rule (see 54 FR 28872 at 28910).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 50. One comment addressed proposed &sect;314.94(a)(12)(viii) and asked FDA to permit applicants to amend their patent certifications if a patent is declared invalid. The comment proposed that any amendment, with the exception of a paragraph IV certification being changed to a paragraph III certification, be considered nunc pro tunc (now for then). If a patent were declared invalid, the comment suggested that an amendment from paragraph IV to paragraph III be considered ``as if a III were originally filed, subject to a prior IV certificant's exclusivity rights during the remaining lifetime of the patent.'' Finally, the comment said that applicants should be permitted to make a paragraph I certification if the patent were removed from the list.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA agrees in part with the comment. An applicant may change its certification at any time. Although there is no need for the agency to pronounce such changes in certification nunc pro tunc, the agency agrees that the protection offered by 180-day exclusivity should not be undermined by changes from paragraph IV certification or by the filing of original certifications other than paragraph IV certifications. If a patent were removed from the list immediately upon a court decision that the patent is invalid or unenforceable, an applicant with a subsequently filed application might seek to certify that there is no relevant patent and seek an immediately effective approval. To ensure that this does not occur, the agency has required that a patent remain on the list after being declared invalid or unenforceable until the end of any applicable 180-day exclusivity period. This means that a patent is deemed to be relevant under &sect;314.94(a)(12)(ii) until the end of the term of the patent or applicable 180-day exclusivity period, whichever occurs first. Thus, where there is a patent that has been challenged by a paragraph IV applicant, a subsequent applicant will not be able to file a certification that there is no relevant patent or seek an immediately effective approval until either the patent or the 180-day exclusivity period expires. The agency has amended &sect;314.94(a)(12)(viii)(B) and made a similar change to &sect;314.50(i)(6)(ii) to reflect this position.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency also notes that an applicant may withdraw its patent certification at any time. However, as stated earlier, if an ANDA applicant made a paragraph IV certification and later withdraws that certification, the agency will not regard the withdrawn paragraph IV certification as precluding the agency from granting 180-day exclusivity to a subsequent ANDA applicant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

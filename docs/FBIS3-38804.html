In a statement at Ankara's Esenboga Airport before his  departure, Erhan said that last year imports from Iran amounted  to $590 million, while exports totaled $235 million.    Erhan said that during the talks, the two sides will discuss  ways of increasing exports to Iran, eliminating the delays in  payment, and the issue of receiving additional crude oil in  return for goods. He added: We will also discuss border trade,  the Iran-Turkey-Europe natural gas pipeline, and cooperation in  the fields of agriculture, petrochemicals, transportation, and  communications.    Erhan will return to Turkey on 10 February.</p>

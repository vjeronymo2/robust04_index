			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Scottish Tories to confront leaders on election failure Scottish Tories, chastened by their disastrous showing in last week's regional council elections, will confront their leaders today at their annual conference in Inverness. Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, will be the first of seven cabinet ministers to address the conference. Mr John Major will attempt to rekindle his premiership at the closing rally on Friday. In a routine that has become all too familiar in the past decade of decline, practically uninterrupted but for a revival in the 1992 general election, the Scottish Tories will try to identify what changes of policy or presentation to make. The regional council election result, in which they made a net loss of 23 seats and took under 14 per cent of the vote, shocked them and came as a pleasant surprise to their Scottish National party, Liberal Democrat and Labour opponents. The Tories are uncertain whether they lost support because of government plans to take Scottish water out of local authority control, or whether former supporters were expressing the same general discontent with the Major government as their counterparts south of the border. Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, inclined to the latter interpretation, although he also said the party would have to 'readdress the things we do and the way in which we present them'. He does not believe many Tory supporters thought it pointless to elect opposition-run councils which are to be abolished in 1996 anyway. Mr Hurd will tackle the issue of the hour when he winds up today's debate on Europe, replying to a motion that 'supports the principle of subsidiarity, rejecting the concept of a federal Europe'. On Thursday Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, will reply to the debate on the economy before embarking on two days of electioneering in north-east Scotland for the European elections. Later that day Mr John McGregor, the transport secretary, will speak. Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary and Mr David Hunt, the employment minister will speak on Friday.</p>

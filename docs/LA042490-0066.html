			<p><P> April 24, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: DANCE  </P> <P> Leningrad Ballet Bows Out: The Leningrad State Ballet has canceled its May 12  performance in San Diego because of an ongoing dispute over the ownership of  ballets created by the company's late founder Leonid Jakobson. Since Jakobson's  death in 1975, the company has been directed by Askold Makarov, a former  leading dancer with the Kirov Ballet.  </P> <P> Irina Jakobson, widow of the company's founder, has claimed that the heirs, and  not the company, are the legal owners of the ballets. The performance was being  sponsored by the San Diego-based California Ballet whose director, Maxine  Mahon, said, "We don't want to put the California Ballet in jeopardy by going  ahead with the concert." The performance would have been the Leningrad State  Ballet's U.S. debut. The company has also canceled its six-week residency in  San Diego, although Makarov will still work with the California Ballet. GREG  BRAXTON  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The scenarios NCTA presents involve situations where enforcement of state and local negative option billing rules would be inconsistent with the federal rule and enforcement might undermine implementation of the cable rate rules promulgated pursuant to Congress's instruction. With respect to the first scenario, the federal negative option billing rule plainly would not require cable operators to obtain affirmative consent from subscribers before passing through external costs and inflation adjustments as permitted by the Commission's rules, as explained above. In addition, enforcement of a state or local negative option billing rule requiring affirmative consent prior to the pass-through of external costs and cost-of-service increases, as permitted by the Commission's rate rules, would undermine the federal regime governing cable rates. The Commission has issued detailed rate rules implementing Section 3 of the 1992 Cable Act. Under the Commission's rules, most cable operators must reduce their rates from pre-1992 levels, many by as much as 17%, to ensure that cable rates are reasonable. However, as the first scenario presented by NCTA recognizes, the rules also allow cable operators to increase their rates to reflect increases in the cost-of-living or other external costs, most of which are beyond cable operators' control. The 17% rate reduction and the rules authorizing the pass-through of external costs and inflation adjustments are of a piece; the rate cut would not be fair to cable operators if they were prohibited from raising rates to reflect increased costs that are beyond their control. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The other two scenarios presented by NCTA involve the addition, deletion and replacement of channels. The negative option billing regulation makes clear that the requirement that cable operators obtain affirmative consent before charging for a new service ``shall not preclude the addition or deletion of a specific program from a service offering, the addition or deletion of specific channels from an existing tier of service, or the restructuring or division of existing tiers of service that do not result in a fundamental change in the nature of an existing service, or tier of service.'' 47 CFR 76.981. Accordingly, the replacement of a single channel, NCTA's third scenario, would not be prohibited by the federal negative option billing provision, because that would not result in a ``fundamental change'' unless the tier was very small. With respect to NCTA's second scenario, involving the addition or deletion of channels, the answer would depend on how many channels were added or deleted and other factors relevant to determining whether a ``fundamental change'' had occurred. As stated above, however, changes that are permitted under the ``Operator's Cap'' generally would not constitute ``fundamental changes.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the addition, deletion, or replacement of channels did not constitute a fundamental change in a tier, so that the federal negative option billing rule was not triggered, preemption of enforcement of a stricter state or local negative option billing rule would depend on whether enforcement would conflict with or undermine the rate regulation rules established pursuant to Section 3 of the 1992 Cable Act. It is not possible to provide a blanket response to NCTA's second and third scenarios in the absence of a specific set of facts to evaluate. However, it bears emphasis that the rate rules governing the addition, deletion, and replacement of channels are designed to ensure reasonable rates without impeding the provision of new services. Indeed, the rate rules are designed to encourage the provision of new services that subscribers desire at the reasonable rates mandated by Congress. Therefore, an interpretation of state or local law that required a cable operator to obtain the affirmative consent of every subscriber before making a change that did not fundamentally alter the affected tier would, in most cases, interfere with the accomplishment of Congress's objectives. In relatively few cases, in the Commission's view, would state or local officials be likely to seek to enforce negative option billing rules that conflict with or undermine federal rate regulation provisions. But in any event, on further consideration the Commission is convinced that, however numerous such cases are likely to be, state and local officials may not enforce negative option billing rules that obstruct the accomplishment of the objectives of Congress's cable rate provisions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Affiliate Transactions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the Cost Order in MM Docket No. 93&hyph;215, 59 FR 17975 (April 15, 1994), the Commission promulgated a rule for valuing transactions between cable operators and affiliated companies. The Commission found that it would be inconsistent with Congressional intent to allow rates for regulated cable service to reflect the prices affiliates charge each other for transactions that occur at other than arm's length. The Commission found that allowing cable companies to pass increases in their costs through to rate payers could motivate those companies to pay excessive amounts for assets and services obtained from unregulated affiliates. The Commission therefore adopted a rule for affiliate transactions that applies to cable operators who elect cost-of-service regulation or seek to adjust benchmark/price cap rates for affiliated programming costs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the Cost Further Notice, 59 FR 18066, 18067&hyph;18068 (April 15, 1994), the Commission tentatively concluded that the general changes it proposed for affiliate transactions involving telephone companies should be applied to cable operators. The Commission tentatively concluded that the use of prevailing company pricing as a valuation method for transactions between cable operators and their affiliates should only be permitted where the predominant purpose of the transaction is to serve non-affiliates. To that end, the Commission proposed that any affiliate that sells less than 75 percent of its output to non-affiliates has too large a volume of affiliate transactions to be deemed to have a predominant purpose of serving non-affiliates. The Commission therefore proposed to continue to allow prevailing company pricing as a valuation method for affiliate transactions only where at least 75 percent of the cable operators output is sold to non-affiliates. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

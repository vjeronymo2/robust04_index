			<p><P> January 6, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BERNARDI FEELING 'JUST FINE' A DAY AFTER FALL IN HOME  </P> <P> Los Angeles City Councilman Ernani Bernardi said Thursday that he feels "just  fine" after being hospitalized for a head injury from a fall at his Van Nuys  home.  </P> <P> Asked if he still plans to run for reelection in April, the northeast San  Fernando Valley councilman said in a telephone interview from his room at  Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Panorama City, "as of now, certainly."  </P> <P> The 77-year-old Bernardi, suffering from a flu-like virus, received five  stitches to the back of his head Wednesday after collapsing and hitting his  head on a kitchen cabinet.  </P> <P> He said he expects to stay at the hospital for a few days for tests.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Better to Stay'  </P> <P> "I think it's better to stay in here a couple of days to be sure that there are  no complications, to be sure I am in good shape," said Bernardi, who has gotten  up and walked around his hospital room. "I hope to be out in a few days."  </P> <P> "There are no indications of major problems," added hospital spokeswoman Karen  Large.  </P> <P> Bernardi, who has been sick with the virus for several days, said he was in the  kitchen when he jumped from a stool to answer the phone.  </P> <P> "I fell and apparently hit my head against the sharp edge of a kitchen  cabinet," he said. "It knocked me out, besides putting a gash in my head."  </P> <P> Bernardi said he is in the hospital's coronary care unit for privacy.  </P> <P> Bernardi is the council dean with 27 years of service.  </P></p>

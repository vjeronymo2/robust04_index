			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter: "Sustained Inflation Momentum Basically </F> Curbed, Tightened Money Supply To Insure Strength of Regulation  and Control"]    [Text] An authoritative person in Chinese economic circles  has pointed out that, at present, inflation in China is  basically stable and is expected to fall in the second half of  the year. However, viewed from the macroeconomic situation at  present, we still cannot increase the overall money supply but  should maintain the present strength of macroeconomic regulation  and control.    During a special interview with a MING PAO reporter, the  authoritative person pointed out: Recently, inflation in China  has the growth of the average national retail commodity price  index, which reflects inflation, remains at about 20 percent and  the momentum of sustained growth has been curbed. Inflation is  expected to gradually fall in the second half of this year.    However, he pointed out that although the momentum of growth  in inflation has been curbed, the trend is not yet completely  clear. To promote falling inflation, three conditions are  required: first, a continued increase in agricultural output  this year or at least for output not to decrease; second, a  stable political situation; third, macroeconomic policies remain  stable.    The personality said that, on the whole, the goal of  macroregulation and control this year should still be set at the  original credit scale of 470 billion yuan and the total volume  of credit should be controlled within 500 billion. Therefore,  the existing strength of regulation and control should not be  reduced in an overall manner and only partial readjustments with  clear targets should be made.    It has been disclosed that because of relatively tight money  supply, state enterprises are having universal difficulties in  their operations. To ease the difficulties of state enterprises  in terms of the shortage of funds, China granted 60 billion yuan  of bank loans to state enterprises from March to April this  year. Recently, some localities have again asked for loans to a  large number of state enterprises which are on the brink of  closing down.    The authoritative personality pointed out: The loans granted  to enterprises in March and April were only a partial structural  readjustment and did not mean an increase in the money supply on  the whole. If loans for state enterprises are increased in an  overall manner irrespective of economic results, this will mean  a major readjustment of financial policy. Judging from present  conditions, a policy readjustment of this kind is not likely.    Another noted economist pointed out: The macroeconomic  situation in China at present still depends on investment in  fixed assets. Last year, China invested as much as 1,000 billion  yuan in fixed assets, nearly 400 billion yuan more than the  previous year. This caused the rapid growth of inflation in  China.    He pointed out: Investment in fixed assets should have a  certain balance, that is, on the one hand, it should not cause  excessive inflation, and, on the other, it should be able to  maintain economic growth.</p>

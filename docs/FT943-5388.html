			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / PM demands guarantees of lasting ceasefire from IRA Mr John Major, the prime minister, yesterday insisted he needed a 'copper bottomed' guarantee from the IRA that its ceasefire was permanent before its political wing, Sinn Fein, could join talks on the future of Northern Ireland. He emphasised the government's cautious approach to the ceasefire declared last week by announcing that Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader, would continue to be barred from visiting Britain. The prime minister, speaking on BBC television, said Mr Adams would remain subject to a three-year exclusion order barring him from visiting the UK mainland, and that he did not expect this to be revoked 'in the next few months'. Mr Major's caution was in sharp contrast to that of his Irish counterpart, Mr Albert Reynolds, who is expected to meet Mr Adams this week to discuss Sinn Fein's participation in the Dublin-based Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, which would bring the Irish nationalist movement into talks with political parties in the republic. Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, will today meet Sir Patrick Mayhew, Britain's Northern Ireland secretary to try to resolve the differences between the governments' judgments of how to respond to the ceasefire. An Irish foreign ministry spokesman said: 'We understand the caution of the British government, but we hope that it is going to be cleared up shortly and that the meeting hopefully will contribute to that.' Sir Patrick said Irish nationalists had not yet made it clear that the violence had been permanently ended. Unionist politicians in Northern Ireland yesterday maintained their pressure on London to respond cautiously to the IRA's declaration. Mr Chris McGimpsey, honorary secretary of the Ulster Unionist party (UUP), said a cessation of IRA terrorism was simply a logistical statement whereas a permanent end to violence was a political statement. Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the Democratic Unionist party, said the ceasefire terms had 'a get-out clause to renew the violence if they do not get concessions they are looking for.'

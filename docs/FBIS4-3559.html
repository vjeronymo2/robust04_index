			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Chang Hong: "Jiang Vows To Keep Up Mideast Peace Role"] </F>   [Text] China will maintain its role in the Middle East  peace process, President Jiang Zemin said yesterday in Beijing.    And he called on the parties concerned to remove obstacles  to  achieving further results in their on-going talks.    He told Egyptian President Husni Mubarak that China values  the positive role Egypt has been playing in the peace process.    Mubarak, who flew in for a three day visit yesterday,  briefed  Jiang on the Israeli-PLO negotiations and the developments in  the Middle East peace process.    Meanwhile, the two countries signed an agreement to  encourage  and protect reciprocal investments and a pact on judicial  assistance.    On the Middle East situation, Mubarak said Israel and the  Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) had made a  breakthrough in signing the Gaza-Jericho self-rule pact.    However, they face many problems at present and the parties  had to make concerted efforts to push forward the Middle East  peace process, he said.    Jiang said China welcomes the ground-breaking progress in  the  Israeli-PLO peace talks.    "It is a fact already proven by history that state-to-state  conflicts have to be settled through peaceful negotiations," he  said.    Jiang said the Middle East question is very complicated and  difficulties and obstacles are inevitable during the talks.    Therefore, the relevant parties must never give up their  efforts. They must continue to adopt flexible and pragmatic  attitudes and remove the obstacles to achieving results.    "China has already made, and will continue to make efforts  to  promote the Middle East peace process and work for an early  realization of allround peace in the region," Jiang said.    He added that China appreciates the efforts of President  Mubarak and the Egyptian Government in safeguarding the  interests of the Arab nation and the lawful rights of the  Palestinian people.</p>

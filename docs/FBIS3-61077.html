The Vologda Governor's Policy in the Election Mirror"]    [Text] Vologda--In Vologda Oblast Zhirinovskiy's  party obtained almost twice as many votes as Russia's Choice.  Not without the help of local personnel.    Nikolay Podgornov, chief of the administration of Vologda  Oblast, has several biographies for various of life's  contingencies. In the January issue of the journal VASH VYBOR  (Yaroslavl) he informed the readers that he had acquired a  higher legal education and that at the age of 24 he had been  appointed director of a sovkhoz. On 16 November I learned with  surprise from the Vologda Oblast newspaper KRASNYY SEVER that  Nikolay Podgornov had an "incomplete higher education" and that  he had become a sovkhoz director at the age of 27. And 10 days  later, on 27 November, I read in the list of candidates for  deputy of the Federation Council carried by ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA:  "Nikolay Mikhaylovich Podgornov, born 1949, higher education...."    A brief journalistic investigation showed that these facts  of  the biography of the Vologda governor are inaccurate, to put it  mildly. In August 1977 Nikolay Podgornov was dismissed from the  third year of the All-Union Legal Correspondence Institute for  unsatisfactory progress. So such education cannot even be called  "incomplete higher." Other "touch-ups" were discovered in the  governor's biography also. He maintains that he graduated from  the Velikoustyugskiy River School (a technical school) and  worked as a ship's mechanic at the port of Kotlas. But he in  fact graduated from a vocational-technical school with the  specialty of "ship's engineer-helmsman-mechanic" and worked as a  motor mechanic-seaman of the oil station.    People's Deputy Nikolay Podgornov was in the Supreme Soviet  of Russia, incidentally, a member of the Supreme Economic  Council of the republic.  <H5>  Look Who Has Come </H5>   Nikolay Podgornov was appointed chief of the administration  of the oblast in October 1991 and had prior to this been the  director of the Avrora sovkhoz. Those who recommended him to the  president maintain that they had been won over by Podgornov's  reform activity: He had converted his farm into a  collective-share enterprise. Simply put, he divided the  sovkhoz's assets among the employees. Podgornov took for himself  five hectares of land, a share of the property, and a large  brick house with all the conveniences, with a private parcel of  land of 40 hundredths.    In March 1992 the tax inspectorate of Gryazovetskiy Rayon  discovered that the chief of the administration of the oblast  was continuing to receive his director's pay in Avrora. The  scandal was hushed up.  <H5>  Your Money Will Be Ours </H5>   In May the Vologda leaders proclaimed their oblast some  "state-territorial formation with the constitutional status of  republic." The federal authorities, politicians, and the press  perceived this event with irony--as they had until the recent  elections perceived Zhirinovskiy. But they should not have.    Real power belongs to whoever puts together the budget.  Having become firmly established in the governor's chair,  Nikolay Podgornov issued a directive by which he essentially  brought under his jurisdiction the Vologda Oblast Tax  Inspectorate. But Veniamin Alekseyev, chief of the inspectorate,  declined to comply with the directive as being contrary to  federal laws. The angered governor began to complain regularly  to the leaders of the state tax office of the Russian Federation  about Alekseyev, accusing him of antireform activity and  demanding his immediate dismissal. The latest such report was  dispatched to Moscow immediately following the elections.  Judging by this, it is the chief of the tax inspectorate who is  to blame for the victory of Zhirinovskiy's party in the Vologda  region.    While the capital is investigating these complaints, Nikolay  Podgornov is doggedly attacking the federal budget. In October  he suspended on oblast territory the telegram of the Russian  Ministry of Finance and the Russian Tax Office of 19 August "On  Transfer of Small-Scale Enterprises to Value-Added Tax Treasury  Payments Quarterly."    Vologda Oblast has not yet refused, like Chechnya, to pay  federal taxes. But it is chronically short in its payments to  the Russian Treasury of a large sum.  <H5>  On a Good Footing With the President </H5>   Every Monday oblast television shows a half-hour interview  with Nikolay Podgornov. And whatever the journalist's questions  he is answering, he unfailingly, at least once, emphasizes his  closeness to the president of Russia.    Business is in a bad way: A reduction of 10,000 employees  has  begun at the Cherepovets foundry, and another industrial  giant--the Vologda Optical-Mechanical Plant--will as of 27  December come to a halt "for the Christmas holidays." One-third  of the former sovkhozes and kolkhozes is in fact bankrupt. The  price of food in Vologda and Cherepovets is the highest in the  Northwest. But very pleasant happenings have been taking place,  on the other hand, in the private life of the governor himself.  On the eve of the elections he had a house-warming party in a  three-story private residence built at budget expense especially  for the ruling elite. He himself has taken one  145.5-square-meter apartment. Another--of 160.4 square  meters--he has given Nikolay Golovin, chief of the oblast  militia. In a third he has installed Vologda mayor Boris  Upadyshev. And a fourth remains empty as yet.    Vologda is a small city. And there is nothing surprising in  Podgornov's having lost the elections for Vologda itself. Yet  the remote areas, where the governor is known only from his  television homilies, still elected him to the Federation Council.  <H5>  Down With the Democrats! </H5>   A day before the elections, on Friday, the oblast newspaper  KRASNYY SEVER, a cofounder of which is the administration of the  oblast, carried an article by the writer Vasiliy Belov, whose  authority in the Vologda region is simply enormous. Vasiliy  Ivanovich called on his fellow countrymen under no circumstances  to vote for Russia's Choice or other democrats.    This publication was hardly fortuitous.    In the summer Nikolay Podgornov had allocated to KRASNYY  SEVER from the budget a very large amount of money for the daily  publication of this newspaper, "to increase the influence of the  printed word on the readers, explain and propagandize the  economic policy of the administration of the oblast...," and  since that time KRASNYY SEVER has criticized only the federal  authorities, hereby emphasizing, as it were, that the policy of  the administration of the oblast and the policy of the Russian  Government are not one and the same thing. At the start of the  election campaign, the official newspaper of the Vologda  governor carried an appeal of the communists for a boycott of  the elections. And concluded it with a call by Vasiliy Belov for  all democrats to be given a thrashing. Judging by the results of  the elections, the people of Vologda did not let the words of  this fellow countryman go unheeded.</p>

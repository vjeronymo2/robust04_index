			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GARDENING;  </P> <P> LEMONS TOPS FOR GARDEN, KITCHEN;  </P> <P> CITRUS: CAUGHT BETWEEN DWINDLING SUPPLY AND GROWING DEMAND, LEMONS HAVE RISEN  IN PRICE. AVOID THE PROBLEM BY PLANTING YOUR OWN.  </P> <P> Don't let the price of lemons put a squeeze on your budget -- fight back with  your own lemon tree. According to Don Dillon, a wholesale citrus tree grower,  lemon trees are by far the biggest sellers among the 30 citrus varieties he  supplies to nurseries and garden centers.  </P> <P> The popularity of lemon trees results from two factors: the price of lemons has  risen steadily at the supermarket over the past two years, and lemon trees are  among the most attractive of all citrus trees when used in a landscape.  </P> <P> The reason for the rise in lemon prices is simple -- supply and demand. Lemon  groves are disappearing rapidly to make room for housing and commercial  developments, while at the same time consumers are eating more fish and  seafood, and also using lemons instead of salt in their diets.  </P> <P> The landscape potential of lemon trees is marvelous. The trees are evergreen  and produce pretty, fragrant blossoms and glowing yellow fruit that contrast  nicely with the dark foliage. If you lack yard space, a dwarf or semi-dwarf  tree will fit nicely in a small yard or large container. Lemon trees may be  pruned or espaliered to create imaginative landscape designs.  </P> <P> The home gardener can select from five lemon varieties, which range from the  usual to the exotic. The trees vary in size from true dwarf (6 to 8 feet),  semi-dwarf (8 to 12 feet) and standard (15 to 25 feet). Most trees sold as  dwarf are actually semi-dwarf trees. The five varieties include:  </P> <P>  -- Improved Meyer. This is a highly ornamental and most productive tree. It is  one of the few citrus trees that has natural dwarfing tendencies and does not  require special rootstock to produce a small tree.  </P> <P> The Improved Meyer lemon has an orange in its ancestry and the fruit is sweeter  than a true lemon, but still has an excellent flavor. It is thin-skinned and  very juicy. Improved Meyer makes a superb container tree.  </P> <P> Besides of its other attributes, the Meyer lemon is more widely adapted to the  various climatic zones of the Southland than any other variety.  </P> <P>  -- Eureka. A very important commercial lemon and a particularly good choice  for coastal valleys where it produces fruit and blossoms nearly year-round. The  exceptionally handsome tree produces medium-sized, yellow fruit with a good  acid flavor. The Eureka is frost-sensitive and not a good choice for the colder  inland valleys.  </P> <P>  -- Lisbon. A very vigorous and highly productive tree tolerant of both cold  and hot weather. It is a good choice for inland valley and desert areas. The  foliage is dense and the blossoms are tinged with purple and quite attractive.  The fruit is juicy with a great deal of acidity.  </P> <P>  -- Ponderosa. An interesting novelty tree, this lemon-citrus hybrid produces a  fruit that often weighs several pounds, has a thick rind and is not very juicy.  For fruit production, Ponderosa is not a good choice. However, the small trees  are highly ornamental.  </P> <P>  -- Sungold. This is a dramatic new lemon tree that would be a focal point in  any landscape. Both the leaves and the fruit of Sungold are variegated -- the  leaves are streaked with yellow and the fruit is streaked with green. The  two-tone combination is most attractive.  </P> <P> Sungold is a patented variation of the Eureka lemon and has similar production  and climatic requirements. As it is a fairly new introduction, the trees may be  scarce. Your local nursery can probably order a tree for you from a wholesale  grower.  </P> <P> Purchase only healthy, vigorous-looking trees. Avoid trees with long trunks and  those with branches concentrated at the top. The tree should have good skirt  branches near the soil line. If the transplant has any fruit on it, pick it off  so that the tree's energies will be devoted to foliage production.  </P> <P> The tree must be planted in a sunny area. Dig a hole twice the diameter of the  root ball. The new tree should be set at a depth similar to its depth in the  nursery container. Place the tree in the planting hole and make certain that  the grafting union is about three inches above the soil line. Add time-release  fertilizer planting tablets to the soil. Refill the planting hole with the soil  you removed. When you are finished, make certain the tree gets a good soaking.  </P> <P> In hot-sun areas, whitewash the trunk to prevent sunburn, or try wrapping it  with trunk band.  </P> <P> Newly planted trees should be watered moderately twice a week for the first  month. Established trees should be irrigated weekly, except in the winter if  rainfall is plentiful. Feed lemon trees with a citrus fertilizer in March and  again in July.  </P></p>

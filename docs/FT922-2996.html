			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Books: A marriage of letter-writers par excellence - Harold and Vita continue to entertain Anthony Curtis VITA AND HAROLD edited by Nigel Nicolson Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson Pounds 20, 452 pages HOW WELL we know them all by now] Vita intent on her garden and her girlfriends at Sissinghurst. Harold in Teheran, Berlin, London, always at the centre of power, the perfect diplomat working incessantly while somehow finding the time to write diaries, biographies, reviews, and to pursue his discreet affairs with other men. And then there is that other key-player Violet (Trefusis), Mrs Keppel's daughter, mad about Vita and coming within an ace of wrecking the Nicolson's marriage and her own, until forced to retire to her chateau at Saint Loup. The name that stuck in Proust's mind. And Virginia also mad about Vita, while often mad period. At least Virginia turned her Vita-madness to good account when she wrote Vita an extended love-letter in which she fantasised that Vita was an English nobleman who lived resplendently through four centuries and changed his sex. She called it Orlando and pretended it was a novel. Vita had no idea of its existence until it was published in 1928  - as we learn from this new collection of the letters between Vita and Harold, edited by their son, Nigel: 'My own darling, (Harold) I write to you in the middle of reading Orlando, in such a turmoil of excitement and confusion that I scarcely know where (or who]) I am. It came this morning by first post and I have been reading it ever since, and am now half way through. Virginia sent it me in a lovely leather binding - bless her. Oh, Lord how I wonder what you will think of it. It seems to me more brilliant, more enchanting, more rich and lavish, than anything she has ever done. It is like a cloak encrusted with jewels and sprinkled with rose-petals'. It is good to know that that was her reaction, but do we really need yet another thick volume of more than 400 pages containing many of the often daily letters by the partners in what must be the best documented marriage in contemporary history? On Harold's side we have already had the three volumes of his Diary, the later one-volume condensed version of it, including new material and letters at times over-lapping with those printed here, and the two volume biography of him by James Lees-Milne. On Vita's side we have previously had her own account of the affair with Violet published by Nigel Nicolson in Portrait of a Marriage followed by the frank biography by Victoria Glendinning, then the letters Violet to Vita, and the many missives to Vita and entries about her in the letters and diaries of Virginia. Fascinating as all these folk were, is not enough enough? Well, the short answer to that is, yes; but even so I found myself avidly reading on. What we have not had before quite so fully is the situation seen through Vita's eyes, giving us the chance to overhear the continual marital discourse between the pair. Vita's letters to Harold have hitherto been the missing pieces in the jigsaw and now they fall into place. It helps to abate the sense of surfeit that both of them were absolutely superb letter-writers capable of dashing off a marvellous letter at any time of the day or night however busy or tired. Harold's are full of fly-on-the-wall setpieces about the great and the good, as on that occasion at the Villa Mauresque, chez Mr Maugham, when the Duke and Duchess of Windsor arrived for dinner: 'He had on a tussore dinner-jacket. He was in very high spirits. Cocktails were brought and we stood around the fireplace. There was a pause. 'I am sorry we were a little late,' said the Duke, 'but Her Royal Highness couldn't drag herself away'. He had said it. Her (gasp) Royal (shudder) Highness (and not one eye dared to meet another).' Vita's letters are the more domestic and intimate, sometimes terrifying in their depth of insight. Henry Green used to say that people lie like troopers when they are in love, and that statements made in letters on this subject should be treated with great caution. Some of Vita's to Harold in Paris, while he was attending the signing of Treaty of Versailles as part of the British delegation, during the height of the Violet crisis, are a case in point. Cleverly Vita keeps him in play while confessing the overwhelming strength of her passion for Violet; but she is careful not to burn completely the boats of the marriage. Having survived that crisis, none of Vita's subsequent affairs with people like Hilda Matheson, producer of Talks at the BBC, seriously threatened their harmonious and usually contented existence. Their strange union now grew in strength and mutual supportiveness and lasted until Harold's death in 1962. Apart from affection and respect on both sides, feelings we watch turning at the end into genuine love, what seems to have kept it going more than anything was the enforced separation. Rarely could Vita be persuaded to move from her beloved territory in Kent, the writing-room, the restored castle, the gardens, the surrounding village. By contrast, Harold, even after he had given up diplomacy was always on the wing, either to attend the House of Commons as an MP, or to go to some grand reception, or to pursue his research on a biography, as during the long period he spent with the Lindberghs in America, preparing to write the life of Mrs Lindbergh's father, Dwight Morrow. So often apart, Harold and Vita grew ever closer together through the bond formed by this correspondence. Although it was not a marriage that most couples would want to emulate, they showed that, in certain rather special circumstances, it is possible to have your cake and eat it.</p>

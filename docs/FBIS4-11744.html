			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 31 Mar (MENA)--Arab League Secretary General  Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid met today with Ibrahim al-Bishari,  Libya's permanent representative to the Arab League.  'Abd-al-Majid briefed al-Bishari on the outcome of his meeting  today with the British and French ambassadors and the U.S.  charge d'affairs in Cairo.    After the meeting, al-Bishari said 'Abd-al-Majid has a clear  concept of Libya's crisis with the West. This concept is based  on two points--safeguarding Libya's sovereignty and upholding  international law.    Al-Bishari said the Arab League supports the stand of Libya,  which does not seek to escalate the crisis so that its effects  will not adversely affect the whole region.    Al-Bishari described the international blockade of his  country as tantamount to "the illegal detention of a people  inside a small country with limited capabilities and resources."  He noted that it is in Libya's interest to solve the problem  and not to enter into a showdown with three major states.</p>

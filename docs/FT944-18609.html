			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Back from the brink Judged by what might have happened, this weekend's US-Japanese trade agreement marks a victory for common sense. The two sides have averted the immediate danger of a trade war which would have seriously damaged the global economy and sent shock-waves through financial markets. They have also refrained from resorting explicitly to managed trade, which would oblige Japan's government to deliver a fixed share of its national market to US exporters, at the expense of other trading partners. Instead, there is at least a possibility that the agreement may pave the way for beneficial Japanese liberalisation on a multilateral basis. However, the deal marks a truce, not an armistice, in the hostilities which have embittered US-Japanese relations and bedevilled the world trade system for almost a decade. The risk of a renewed flare-up remains, most obviously over cars and car parts, where no agreement has been reached. Here, the US continues to brandish the threat of eventual trade sanctions, albeit in the form of its Section 301 legislation, rather than of the more draconian Super 301 mechanism. Much more remains to be done by the US and Japan if a durable return to stability in the world trade system is to be assured. The most encouraging augury - and the breakthrough which unlocked agreement at the weekend - is the US decision to abandon its insistence on quantified measures of foreign penetration of Japanese markets. Tokyo had rejected these demands from the outset, on the grounds that they amounted to numerical import targets. Though Washington denied this, it failed to dispel suspicions that it was seeking to coerce the Japanese government into cartelising its market for the benefit of US exporters. Competitive access Instead, the negotiators have agreed on a combination of actions by Tokyo to enhance competitive access by increasing market transparency and relaxing regulatory restrictions, notably in telecommunications, medical equipment and insurance. The agreement also envisages that the benefits of such liberalisation should be available to all foreign competitors, not just US producers. As well as honouring its commitment to greater openness, Tokyo needs firmly to entrench the principle of multilateralism. Failure to do so would invite accusations of favouritism from other trading powers - notably the EU - and pressures to reach bilateral deals with them which would fragment the global trade system. The most effective solution is for Japan to table this weekend's concessions in the Gatt. Japan should also demand that the US seek to resolve any future bilateral trade differences through negotiation in the World Trade Organisation - or, if necessary, through the strengthened dispute settlement procedures planned for the body. Uruguay ratification The priority for the US should be to facilitate that course by swiftly ratifying the Uruguay Round world trade agreement. The deal with Japan should help that process in two ways. First, it removes a distraction which has absorbed far too much of the Clinton administration's political energy; second, to the extent that it redeems the administration's reputation for inept and irresolute handling of international economic policy, it should strengthen its hand in dealing with an increasingly recalcitrant Congress. Nonetheless, the hurdles to ratification remain daunting. Even if the administration can overcome the recent delaying tactics of Senator Ernest Hollings, the chairman of the Senate commerce committee, Congress seems unlikely to vote on the Uruguay Round until after the November elections. There is a risk that virulent partisanship could then induce many Republicans to vote against the round simply to frustrate the administration's agenda. President Bill Clinton has compounded his difficulties by not selling the round aggressively enough to Congress and the American people. He needs to build swiftly on this weekend's agreement by spelling out clearly what is at stake. No US congressman should be left in doubt about the size of the gains which the Uruguay accord offers the US economy - or of the costs if it were allowed to fail.</p>

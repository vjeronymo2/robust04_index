			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Leading Article: When a system breaks down For all its well-deserved reputation for taking industry seriously, Germany offers a surprisingly large number of case studies where various failures of management supervision have led to highly-publicised corporate losses or even, in extreme cases, financial collapse. The list of well-known companies which during the last 10 or 15 years have been dealt severe blows through spectacular incapacity to exert proper control over aspects of their business include AEG, Nixdorf, Grundig, Krupp, Kloeckner &amp; Co and Volkswagen. Metallgesellschaft, the Frankfurt-based metals and industrial group, whose chief executive was forced to resign on Friday, has now become the latest example of a high profile company falling prey to misguided decisions. Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch, an outspoken Austrian who was elected Germany's manager of the year in 1991, led Metallgesellschaft's energetic and generally well-regarded moves into new business areas in recent years. He was dismissed after failing to keep his supervisory board informed of problems at the group's US trading subsidiary, losses at which have been large enough to have created a group liquidity crisis. On one level, the story of Mr Schimmelbusch's fall from grace demonstrates little more than that, in any capitalist economy, charismatic chief executives sporadically fly too close to the sun. On another level, however, the Metallgesellschaft case offers insights into the strengths and weaknesses of Germany's system of corporate governance. Shareholder pressure German companies' dependence on stock market finance is relatively low, even though they are slowly becoming more sensitive to shareholder pressure, not least because of the need to turn to foreign investors for a greater proportion of their funds. As a result of the commensurately low influence of shareholders, Germany's supervisory boards - comprising representatives of shareholders and labour - have a disproportionately large responsibility for ensuring that management makes the right decisions. In many cases, supervisory boards can exert a positive influence by providing companies with a favourable environment for long-term planning. In particular, companies are protected from the need to pay undue attention to short-term stock market fluctuations and to the threat of hostile takeovers. However, there is a danger that the system, by drawing supervisory boards into too close and trusting a relationship with management, can offer executive boards an imprudent amount of decision-making leeway. German style supervision can shield companies from the discipline that would otherwise be exerted by financial markets. Lines of communication Metallgesellschaft's supervisory board is dominated by representatives of Deutsche and Dresdner Banks and the Allianz insurance company. Although Mr Schimmelbusch was clearly at fault in failing to keep lines of communication open with the supervisory board, the latter also seems to have been only incompletely fulfilling its responsibility for checking his actions. Germany's two largest banks should now review whether their representatives on supervisory boards around the country are really in touch with the companies they help to lead. The interlocking system of German capitalism, founded on co-operation between management, banks, government and labour, has been an essential factor behind the country's recovery after 1945. For much of the post-war era, German-style consensus seemed to offer a more reliable, fair and efficient means of achieving economic growth than the more free-wheeling economic systems in Britain or the US. Now, however, German industry is facing peculiarly difficult challenges caused by recession and high production costs, while society as a whole has become a great deal more brittle as a result of the strains of reunification. As a result, the question of whether Germany's consensus-based industrial structure needs a radical overhaul has become a matter of unusual public debate. If Mr Schimmelbusch's downfall helps to give this debate extra focus, then the Metallgesellschaft case will have had a salutary effect for German industry as a whole.</p>

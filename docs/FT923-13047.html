			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / International Company News: Asset sales push First American into profit FIRST AMERICAN Bankshares, the Washington-based bank that, according to the US Federal Reserve, was secretly and illegally controlled by the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI), yesterday announced a quarterly profit for the first time in two years. The bank, which suffered heavy losses in 1991, said it achieved net profits of Dollars 8.2m in the three months ended June 30. This compared with a Dollars 59.3m loss in the second quarter of last year. The 1992 second-quarter results were boosted by Dollars 10.1m of gains on the sale of First American assets in Georgia and Dollars 7.4m of gains on the sale of securities. Mr George Davis, who was named chief executive of First American last January, said plans for the sale of all the bank's assets were going ahead. He said the Federal Reserve last Friday approved the bank's capital plan along with its timetable for the asset sale. The total assets of First American, which in 1991 fell from Dollars 11bn to Dollars 8.4bn, declined to Dollars 6.5bn in the first six months of 1992. The decrease was attributed to the Georgia asset disposal, continued weak demand for loans and a lower level of investments. The bank's total equity base, which shrank last year from Dollars 711m to Dollars 422m, declined to Dollars 398.6m by the end of last month. Deposits, which fell from Dollars 9bn to Dollars 7.1bn, slumped to Dollars 5.6bn in the first half of 1992. The bank attributed Dollars 841.4m of the decrease to the sale of Georgia assets and the balance to the run-off of certificates of deposit. Non-performing assets were Dollars 585m at the end of the second quarter, down from Dollars 629m at the end of last year. The bank's current trusteeship plan would implement a March 1991 Fed order that instructed BCCI to divest itself of shares in First American held by Credit &amp; Commerce American Holdings NV (CCAH), an offshore holding vehicle that featured several nominee shareholders described by the Fed last year as 'front men' for BCCI. Controversy over First American has focused to a large extent on state and federal investigations of Mr Clark Clifford and Mr Robert Altman, respectively the former chairman and president of the bank, who resigned last August. Both have denied having known of BCCI's secret control of First American, although former BCCI officials have testified to the contrary. First American itself has not been accused of any wrongdoing.</p>

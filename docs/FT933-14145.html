			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / International Company News: Charles Schwab ahead at Dollars 31.6m but growth slows CHARLES Schwab, the largest discount brokerage house in the US, yesterday reported a big increase in second-quarter profits to Dollars 31.6m, up from the Dollars 18.5m earned in the same quarter of 1992. Like other securities houses, however, Schwab's profits in the second quarter were slightly lower than in the first period of the year, when the firm earned a record Dollars 35.4m. The downturn in earnings suggests that while Wall Street continues to benefit from a two-year boom in stock market and underwriting activity, the pace of growth has slackened over the past three months. Yesterday, the San-Francisco based firm said that client trading activity in June was the softest of any month this year. Mr Charles Schwab, chairman, said he also expected retail trading activity to weaken in the third quarter, although he believed the firm's results for that period would still be an improvement on the same period of 1992, when Schwab earned a below-average Dollars 7.8m. Commission revenues rose 34 per cent to Dollars 136m, mutual fund service fees by 53 per cent to Dollars 23.1m, and principal transactions revenues by 30 per cent to Dollars 39.3m. Non-interest expenses rose 26 per cent to Dollars 180.4m, primarily due to increased trading activity and an 8.5 per cent rise in client assets to a record Dollars 79.2bn. Shares in Schwab rose initially on the earnings announcement, but then fell back from close to a year-high on profit-taking. By the end of trading the stock was at Dollars 27 5/8, down Dollars 1 3/8.</p>

"It is Japan and Western Europe that the US Government and  businesses should square up to," said Zhou Shijian, Vice  President of the Institute of International Trade Research at  the Ministry of Foreign Trade and economic Co-operation.    He attributed the US's ballooning trade deficit mainly to  the  country's lacklustre competition with Japan and Western Europe  in capital-and technology-intensive projects.    "The deficit with China is the result of a reshaped US  industrial structure, which encourages the import of  labour-intensive products from the country," he explained.    The US would have even higher costs if it reduced such  imports and relied on domestic production, he added.    "The imports, although producing trade deficits, help the US  to direct more of its resources to high technology development,"  he said.    The US has moved a large chunk of its labour-intensive  projects overseas since the end of World War II to take  advantage of cheap local labour.    "This shift can only be conducive to the American economy,"  Zhou said.    A similar advantage arises from the US policy to import  natural resources such as oil, rather than to use its own.    Although the imports fuel its trade deficit, they  effectively  preserve the US's own natural resource reserves, Zhou argued.    It is estimated that, each year, the US consumes about 30  percent of the world's natural resources, including 26.6 percent  of oil production.    "As the world's second largest oil producer, the US could  well reduce its imports by exploring for more domestic crude oil  and natural gas. But this runs counter to the US policy to use  foreign oil first," Zhou pointed out.    To cut the trade surplus with the US, Japan has proposed to  import oil from Alaska, but the offer was rejected by the US.    In short, the imports of large amounts of resources and  daily  consumer goods form an integral part of the US economy and  support its economic growth, Zhou concluded.    "What poses the real threat to the American economy is the  competition from Japan and Westem Europe in such high-tech areas  as computers, automobiles, silicon semiconductors and so on," he  said.    By 1992, Japanese-made sedan cars had dominated about  one-fourth of the American market, pushing the US Big  Three--General Motors, Ford and Chrysler--to order intermittent  layoffs.    "The US has to come up with a serious strategy for this  problem," Zhou said.    As a result of teetering productivity in the 1970s to 1980s,  the US economy stagnated.    Indeed, US productivity in the manufacturing sector has  trailed that of most Western countries, a fact which eventually  led to the US's first trade deficit in 1971 since 1888 A rising  US dollar has also contributed much to the country's growing  deficit, Zhou said.    As for the US's claims of a huge deficit with China, he  said,  the figures are bloated.    What with more Japanese, Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwanese and  South Korean companies investing in China, their trade surpluses  with the US have been concealed and unjustifiably calculated  into the Chinese accounts.    These companies create huge margins of profits by exporting  their Chinese-made products to the US.    But the US regards all this profit as rolling into China's  pockets, because US trade statistics are based on a product's  country of origin.    "In fact, more than two-thirds of the US deficit since the  1980s has been caused by direct and indirect trade with Japanese  companies," Zhou pointed out.    Similarly, the US has calculated much of the profits earned  in China by Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwanese investors as China's  revenues.    China actually has received only processing fees from the  companies financed by these regions, Zhou said.    Foreign-invested enterprises account for more than 20  percent  of China's annual export volumes.    Much of their exports have ended up in the US market,  inflating China's trade surplus with the US.    Moreover, many US multinationals, such as Nike, ship most of  their Chinese-made products back to the US, with revenues lining  American pockets.    But the US regards these sales as China's exports, Zhou  pointed out.    "If the US had clearer statistics for the internal trade of  its own multinationals, we could say that the US enjoys a trade  surplus, not a trade deficit, at present," he said.    Meanwhile, the US does not include its income from arms  sales-- valued at an average of $20 billion to $30 billion each  year--into its trade figures.</p>

			<p><P> December 13, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A. PEOPLE AND EVENTS  </P> <P> For a while it seemed like a race to see who would win the Municipal Grinch  award:  </P> <P>  -- Santa Monica, which has hung holiday banners festooned with seaweed and  dolphins instead of Santa and reindeer, or,  </P> <P>  -- Los Angeles, which recently wrapped City Hall in a fence topped by three  rows of barbed wire.  </P> <P> L.A. City Councilman Nate Holden, startled by the cellblock-spirit of the  latter display, said Friday: "That fence is not going to stay up."  </P> <P> And when the council met Tuesday, Holden demanded that the L.A. Wall be taken  down, growling: "They're ripping down walls in Germany and all over the world,  and here we are separating the citizens from our City Hall."  </P> <P> But Holden, told by Recreation and Parks officials that a temporary fence was  necessary to keep people from tripping over a landscaping project, agreed to  drop the motion after he learned that the boughs of barbed wire had been  removed.  </P> <P> Fa la la la . . .  </P> <P> There's no question that Monrovia is bursting with holiday spirit, judging from  the display outside one of the city's intimate apparel shops.  </P> <P> While the L.A. City Council was able to achieve a quorum Tuesday, there have  been times -- as on one occasion last week -- when a session was canceled  because not enough members were present.  </P> <P> And even when enough lawmakers do show up, there are invariably a few  stragglers that delay the start for 20 minutes or so. Snagged, no doubt, on the  new barbed-wire fence.  </P> <P> Dreamers who thought that the presence of cable television cameras would  eliminate tardies were mistaken. Councilman Hal Bernson went so far the other  day as to raise the possibility of fining the delinquents.  </P> <P> "I think it's time we started doing something," he said.  </P> <P> In the meantime, the council's thrice-weekly TV show should be called, "The  Late Show."  </P> <P> Tardiness also has plagued the supervisors, inspiring Pete Schabarum to come up  with an ingenious solution: Start the sessions half an hour later at 10 a.m.  </P> <P> But colleague Deane Dana, usually an ally, objected, reasoning: "You'd soon  find we were starting at 10:20."  </P> <P> And colleague Mike Antonovich, usually an ally, complained that a 10 a.m. start  wouldn't leave the board enough time to accomplish its business.  </P> <P> Schabarum lashed back at Antonovich: "You don't show up at 9:30!"  </P> <P> The motion failed, despite Schabarum's declaration that "I got better things to  do than waiting around here for everyone to get their act together."  </P> <P> Might we suggest a solution: Move the starting time from 9:30 to 10 a.m., but  don't tell the supervisors.  </P></p>

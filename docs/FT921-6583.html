			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Leading Article: Mr Keating's election bid MR PAUL Keating waited a long time to succeed Mr Bob Hawke as Australia's prime minister; so long that his first throw of the dice also represents his last chance to win back a disaffected electorate. Under Australia's three-year cycle, elections must be held by the middle of next year - the fourth time the Labor party will have sought re-election since coming to power in 1983. To win, Mr Keating must produce a tangible improvement in the economy, for whose difficulties he himself bears considerable responsibility in his former role as Treasurer. The long leadership struggle last year contributed to a general view in Australia that the Labor government was worn out and bankrupt of ideas. But a deep, two-year recession, which has pushed unemployment to 10.3 per cent, has been the more important underlying cause. The party's loss of popularity may be irretrievable. Naturally enough for a man who has little more than a year to stamp the contrary impression on voters, the prime minister declared that the package of measures he announced yesterday would 'stir the imagination' and lead to 'a turning point in our economic history and our social history'. The measures do neither of these things. Instead, they offer a short-term boost to the economy - actually rather smaller than markets had been expecting, but with the promise of personal tax cuts after the elections - while continuing the process of structural reform set in train by Mr Hawke and Mr Keating in his earlier incarnation. Regional market The measures reflect Mr Keating's long-standing objectives. He has played a key role in the opening up of the Australian economy, including the floating of the Australian dollar, tariff reductions and tax and banking reform. Mr Keating has now created a regional aviation market. He has removed the requirement for 50 per cent Australian equity in mining ventures and raised the threshold at which foreign mining investments require official scrutiny. And he has eliminated most restrictions on foreign banks' entry into Australia. At the same time, he deserves credit for resisting strong domestic pressure to slow tariff reductions. The other side of Mr Keating's record is one of substantial responsibility for a boom-bust cycle. True, fluctuating commodity prices have added difficulties. But Mr Keating misjudged policy, particularly in pulling on the monetary reins too tightly, so adding to the depth of the recession. Now, monetary policy has eased (though real interest rates remain high) and fiscal policy is being relaxed too. Implausible move To move from zero to 4 3/4 per cent economic growth in one year, and to maintain growth around that level, seems implausible. If it were achieved through increased exports, it would arouse no concern. But the indications are that the growth is projected to come more from domestic demand. This would seem a recipe for a worsening current account, now projected to rise from 3.75 to 4.5 per cent of GDP next year and difficulties with Australia's foreign debt. The currency, which had already weakened in recent weeks ahead of the statement and dropped further yesterday, could come under pressure. Mr Keating's projection of a jump in inflation, from the current 1.5 to 3.5 per cent next year, could also be too low. Even so, the gamble represented by measures actually undertaken yesterday is not huge. The ADollars 2.3bn job-oriented stimulus is concentrated on infrastructural projects, which are badly needed. The budget deficit for this year, projected at 1.8 per cent of GDP, is small. If Mr Keating can strike a wage deal with the unions, the lid will be kept on inflation. Mr Keating cannot be accused of betting the economy to save his political future. Most of the steps he has taken are sensible, even if the economic projections are shaky, as is their wont. But he has not shown that he will have fresh ideas for revitalising the Labor party, should he win re-election. The Australian electorate may need a clearer sight of his vision before giving Labor another term.</p>

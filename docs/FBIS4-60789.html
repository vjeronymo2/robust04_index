			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone report by Ertugrul Bulent Danaci from Ashgabat </F> over regional map -- recorded]    [Text] This morning, Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin was  received by Turkmen President Saparmurad Niyazov, who told Cetin  that Turkmenistan is grateful to Turkey for its contributions to  Turkmenistan's development. Niyazov pointed out that work is  under way in connection with the natural gas pipeline, adding  that the natural gas will arrive in Turkey within two years and  will be used at a much cheaper rate than today.    Niyazov said that Turkmenistan wants to name a textile  factory under construction in the city of Tedzhen after  President Suleyman Demirel.    Foreign Minister Cetin said he is happy to see the progress  Turkmenistan has made in two years. He pointed out that the  brotherly relations between Turkey and Turkmenistan develop with  each passing day, adding: Turkey will continue to extend all  kinds of help to brotherly Turkmenistan.    Cetin recalled that the project to deliver natural gas from  Turkmenistan to Europe via Turkey is being executed by a  consortium composed of Turkey, Turkmenistan, Russia, and Iran.  He also said that Turkish businessmen want to build a port in  the city of (Turkmenbasi) on the Caspian Sea.    During the meeting, which was conducted in a very warm  atmosphere, Cetin repeated President Demirel's invitation to  President Niyazov to visit Turkey. Cetin presented Niyazov with  maps of Turkmenistan printed in Turkey in the Latin and Cyrillic  alphabets, as well as with a Turkish diplomatic passport.  Niyazov kissed the passport and touched it to his forehead,  saying he considers Turkey his second motherland.    It is reported that Niyazov's visit to Turkey will take  place  either in late June or early July.    Cetin briefly interrupted his contacts in Turkmenistan to  visit Tashkent, the capital of Uzbekistan. He was received at  Tashkent Airport by Uzbek Foreign Minister Saidmukhtar Said  Asymov. Cetin was later received by President Islam Karimov.  The two men discussed all aspects of the relations between the  two countries. On behalf of President Demirel, Cetin invited  Karimov to Turkey. Meanwhile, Turkish Ambassador to Uzbekistan  Erdogan Aytun presented his credentials to Karimov.    In the afternoon, delegations from the two countries, headed  by the respective foreign ministers, held talks. Uzbek Foreign  Minister Asymov said his country wants to further develop its  economic and political relations with Turkey. He recalled that  Turkey was the first country to recognize Uzbekistan and  stressed that his people will never forget that.    Cetin said Turkey believes that relations between the two  countries -- which are relatives, making them closer than  friends -- have not developed sufficiently. He pointed out that  the volume of trade between the two countries is $225 million.  This should be raised to $1 billion, he stressed.    The foreign minister stated that Turkey extends all the  economic aid it can to Uzbekistan. He explained that the  $250-million loan extended by Eximbank and the $245-million  sugar and wheat loans are being used. After concluding his  contacts in Uzbekistan, Cetin returned to Ashgabat.    Tomorrow morning, Cetin will sign a consular agreement and a  protocol on solidarity between the foreign ministries of the two  countries. He will then return to Turkey.</p>

Kohl did not cite one  specific instrument to reform the social state, safeguard  Germany as an economic location, and combat the dramatic  unemployment. "This chancellor lacks the strength for the sober  and honest determination of his position," Verheugen said in a  statement.    The optimism demonstrably expressed by Kohl and his party  cannot cover up the CDU's glaring inability to master the  challenges of the future. "It is already clear that the  congress will not lead to improving the people's dramatic loss  of trust in the largest government party," Verheugen said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] In its editorial, the newspaper AL-BA'TH discusses  the importance of the coordination, cooperation, and fraternity  treaty concluded between the two sisterly countries of Syria and  Lebanon. It asserts that the treaty has strengthened many  common features between the two fraternal countries, thus  unifying their paths and objectives.    AL-BA'TH adds: Among these features is the need for a joint  confrontation of the Israeli occupation and ambitions. Both  countries have pledged to continue coordination and  consultations in order to liberate southern Lebanon and the  Golan. This has been obvious since the launching of the peace  process. Both Syria and Lebanon proved that any attempt to  single out any party was doomed to failure because the  leadership and people in Syria and Lebanon are fully convinced  that what harms ones side will also harm the other.    AL-BA'TH asserts that the executive measures of the  coordination and cooperation treaty have created much popular  satisfaction, especially after the recently announced measures  to facilitate movement at the Syrian-Lebanese border. The paper  says this step will undoubtedly consolidate the ties between the  citizens of the one people in the two countries.</p>

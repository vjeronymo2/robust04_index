			<p><P> November 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'WISEGUY' GETS OLDER -- AND WISER;  </P> <P> TELEVISION: CO-CREATOR STEPHEN J. CANNELL HAS RETURNED TO SIMPLIFY THE CBS  SERIES, WHICH HAS A NEW STAR AND WRITING STAFF. LAST SEASON, HE SAID, 'YOU  COULDN'T FIGURE WHAT WAS GOING ON.'  </P> <P> It's not the same old "Wiseguy" that will be kicking off its fourth season  Saturday night. The CBS series will boast a new star, Steven Bauer, a new  female cast member, a new co-executive producer and a new writing staff.  </P> <P> "It is sort of like bringing it back from the dead," said Stephen J. Cannell,  the co-creator and executive producer who has returned to "Wiseguy."  </P> <P> Though never a ratings blockbuster, "Wiseguy," which followed the exploits of  an undercover federal agent who infiltrated crime organizations, was a critical  success that boasted such diverse guest stars as Ray Sharkey, Kevin Spacey,  Jerry Lewis, Ron Silver, Joan Chen and Tim Curry. After its second season, the  series received numerous Emmy nominations, including one as best drama series  and one for leading actor Ken Wahl.  </P> <P> Last season, however, the small-but-loyal audience began tuning out in droves  because of muddled story lines and the absence of Wahl for several episodes,  due to an ankle injury. As a result, "Wiseguy" didn't make CBS' fall schedule,  receiving instead a mid-season pickup for 13 episodes.  </P> <P> The problem, Cannell said, was that "Wiseguy" became too wise for its own good.  </P> <P> "If you didn't watch (regularly) -- and not only watch it, but make a graph of  it -- you couldn't figure what was going on," he said. "What happened is that  people would tune in, get confused and stay away."  </P> <P> Cannell wasn't involved much in the show last season, but he is now. His  intention is "to go back to the same kind of storytelling we did in the first  and second seasons." Although some story lines will still have an arc over  several episodes, each installment will also have self-contained stories to  accommodate casual viewers.  </P> <P> Wahl's exit from the show was the subject of controversy last season. Wahl told  The Times in June that he was dropped from the show against his will, while the  producers maintained that the actor had wanted to leave. Cannell acknowledged  recently that the two did have creative differences. He said that he wanted to  deal with the moral problems that an undercover agent has, while Wahl, he said,  "thought it was very difficult for him to be playing a guy who had any naivete  about his situation."  </P> <P> The upshot is that Saturday's two-hour season premiere finds Wahl's character,  agent Vinnie Terranova, missing and presumed dead. Agent Frank McPike (Jonathan  Banks) conducts an investigation that leads him to Miami and to an uneasy  alliance with Michael Santana (Bauer), a disbarred Cuban-American prosecutor  who had worked with Terranova.  </P> <P> Santana is drawn into the investigation when it leads to Amado Guzman  (Maximilian Schell), a powerful Cuban-American businessman for whom Santana's  father works. Santana gets a job with Guzman's company when he discovers that  Guzman's freight airline is a cover for illegal activities.  </P> <P> "The easiest thing we could have done is the 'Son of Vinnie' and do something  about another Sicilian American from Brooklyn in the mold Ken Wahl created,"  said Peter Lance, the show's new co-executive producer. "But when Stephen  finally fixed on Steven Bauer as the new hero, we looked to his roots. He was  born in Cuba and came to America, so we said, 'Why don't we explore that?' The  Cuban-Americans, next to the Vietnamese, are the most interesting recent ethnic  group to come to America. They have completely revitalized Miami, so we  decided, why not go in this direction?"  </P> <P> "I couldn't ask for a more ideal situation," said Bauer, who appeared in such  films as "Scarface" and the Emmy Award-winning NBC miniseries "Drug Wars: The  Camarena Story." "The show had loyal supporters and I am part of its new  chance, its new life. It can only get better unless with me it dies, but I  don't think that will happen. The character is brand-new and he is coming from  an ethnic cultural background that is brand new to TV."  </P> <P> Actress Cecil Hoffmann, who appeared on the short-lived NBC series "Dream  Street," also is joining the cast as attorney Hilary Stein, who was Santana's  co-counsel and now works with Guzman.  </P> <P> "We decided the show needed the involvement of a woman in a big way," Lance  said. "Even in the first season, with Vinnie and Susan Profitt (with whom  Vinnie fell in love), there was a sense that women could watch the show and  have some franchise in it. It had taken a turn away from that."  </P> <P> Lance said that "Wiseguy" is going to have an uphill climb in order to succeed,  however. In its regular time slot of Saturdays at 10 p.m., it will be competing  with "Carol &amp; Company" on NBC and "Twin Peaks" on ABC.  </P> <P> "So many people left the show last year that (CBS) pulled the reruns this  summer; that's how bad it got," he said. "There's also the Jane Pauley  Syndrome, which is a valid one: The public gets angry when you change heroes.  (But) what we have tried to do is so ambitious and so different, I have a lot  of faith in the American public. . . . Audiences love their heroes and  heroines, but people also like a good hour of TV."  </P></p>

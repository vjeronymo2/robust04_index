			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Survey of Poland (15): Wallflower opens - Quest for foreign investment IN THE foreign investment dance of the post-communist countries Poland feels that it has been a wallflower. By the end of 1990, according to Mr Zbigniew Piotrovsky, head of the Foreign Investment Agency, founded in 1988, only Dollars 160m had been invested by foreign partners in joint ventures that were in operation. Yet things are looking up, since this represented a four-fold increase over the level at the end of the previous year. Furthermore, in 1990 the FIA handled 1,752 applications to establish joint ventures, more than twice as many as in 1989. Among these investors are such famous western names as Philips and Pilkingtons, but by far the most important source of investment applications is Germany, with more than a third of the total in 1990. Poland hopes for much more. The recently signed multilateral agreement to lower Poland's official external debt by 50 per cent is bound to help. Also likely to help is a revised Foreign Investment Law, now before parliament. The new law makes four main changes to present legislation: The need for permits from the FIA is now to be limited to a very few sensitive areas; The previous minimum entry requirement of Dollars 50,000 and 20 per cent of the capital stock is to be abolished; Tax incentives are to be modified. The automatic three-year tax holiday is to be abolished. The new law will retain a form of tax holiday, but for substantial investors, with a minimum equity requirement; Automatic guarantees are to be provided against expropriation and nationalisation and full repatriation of profits, capital gains and dividends. All this should help, as should determined attempts to bring foreign investors into the rapidly accelerating privatisation programme. But the most important conditions are successful stabilisation of the Polish economy and liberal terms of association with the European Community. The battle for both is now fully engaged. If Poland succeeds, it should soon cease to be a wallflower.</p>

			<p><P> July 14, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE'S MEDFLY SPRAYING POLICY  </P> <P> My family and I feel we are in a nightmare from which there is no end. We have  been sprayed 12 times with malathion and now we are scheduled to be sprayed  three more times, probably all summer.  </P> <P> I have a 6-month-old son and a 3-year-old daughter, and my greatest fear for  their health is from our own state government! Our despair, anger and disgust  are overwhelming.  </P> <P> California is cutting back funds for trauma centers, schools, the disabled and  the blind -- but it blithely spends $100 million for pesticides and  helicopters! We have a drought in Los Angeles and can't wash our cars or water  our yards without getting a fine, but the state can dump all the pesticides it  wants on those same yards and cars.  </P> <P> California's shortfall is not in money -- it's in morality.  </P> <P> JOHN VORNHOLT  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Charles Lambroschini: "Rwanda, the French </F> Example"]    [Excerpts] If France does not go to Rwanda, who will? It  "invented" human rights, it is the only Western power which is  still involved in Africa, it is the only one to have credible  military resources. [passage omitted]    First, a legal reason was needed. Because, for states, which  are cold monsters, indignation is not enough to justify a  policy. Alain Juppe reaffirmed at the United Nations that the  principles inherited from the victory over Hitler impose a duty  of intervention against genocide. In proportion to the French  population, 500,000 victims in Rwanda over the past two months  would be the equivalent of almost 4 million dead in our country.  [passage omitted]    Second, this intervention can only be international. On pain  of being suspected of colonialist nostalgia, France cannot go in  alone. Other European countries are needed and so far only Italy  seems prepared to cooperate. Above all, Africans are needed:  For the time being only Senegal has volunteered.    Paris is accused of flying to the aid of its former ally,  the  Hutu government, which is also mainly responsible for the  massacres. But this is to forget that, since then, the French  Government has changed, and so has its policy. It is also to  disregard the fact that Francois Mitterrand, an active advocate  of an intervention, is less anxious to counter the Tutsis of the  RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] rebel movement than to ease his  conscience.    In reality, France is showing that, when it wishes, it can  make the difference. With regard to GATT, the French were  initially the only ones to reject the agricultural agreement  concocted by the Brussels Commission and the United States. But  [Prime Minister] Edouard Balladur and Alain Juppe finally  persuaded and led their partners. Faced with the Twelve's united  front, the Americans backed down. The scenario was the same in  Bosnia: France played a decisive role in leading its allies,  including the United States, in a firmer military attitude  toward the Serbs and more realistic diplomatic statements about  the Muslims. The result was a marked reduction in the intensity  of the fighting on the ground.    France has a duty to take the initiative on Rwanda. Now that  Africa is no longer an issue between the United States and  Russia, it would certainly be easier to turn a blind eye. But,  abstaining now is to run the risk of being condemned to launch  tomorrow into an even more costly operation. Indeed, it is  clear that, without an external intervention, the problem will  solve itself...by eliminating some of the factors. The advanced  countries would find it difficult to be satisfied with Cain's  answer: "Am I my brother's keeper?"</p>

			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / Observer: MAI's left turn If Lords Hanson, King and Sterling can do it, why can a Labour peer not hold down a full-time job running a publicly quoted company besides moonlighting in the House of Lords? The question arises because Clive Hollick - chief executive of MAI, one of Britain's last surviving financial conglomerates - has just been made a working Labour peer. Given that MAI has big plans to add a TV franchise to its rag-bag of money broking and outdoor poster interests, there is a danger that young Clive, who has another 20 years to go before he collects his old age pension, might be spreading himself a bit thin. The City has always been suspicious of socialist chief executives with beards. Hollick is unrepentant. Having salvaged the group from the 1970s secondary banking crisis, he has come through the recession with a strong balance sheet and gently rising profits. He avoided the pitfalls that snared such bigger groups as Mercantile House and British &amp; Commonwealth, and is kept in check by a reasonably strong board of non-executive directors led by the rather elderly Sir Ian Morrow. Having turned down the idea of buying the New Statesman, Hollick has made his main political contribution as a driving force behind the Institute for Public Policy Research. Set up as a rival to Tory think-tanks, it quickly overcame initial scepticism and is now regarded as having greatly enhanced Labour's more pragmatic approach.</p>

			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: The grocer triumphant Lord Sainsbury's farewell message to the press yesterday was grandiose but impressive. When he took over as chairman in 1969, Sainsbury's profits were one ninth those of Marks and Spencer. They are now bigger. The 17 per cent rise in last year's earnings per share is in astonishing contrast to the corporate sector in general and to Sainsbury's suppliers in particular. Although the group's UK supermarkets enjoyed underlying volume growth of 1 per cent at best, margins were up and growth was higher in the second half than in the first. If this is Sainsbury in a recession, what can go wrong hereafter? One answer is by now familiar. As the company continues to pour capital into new stores - some Pounds 800m this year and next - it has to keep raising margins if it is to maintain its return on capital. It is argued that bigger new stores deliver higher margins automatically by virtue of their cost structure, even without higher sales. But that assumes that Sainsbury and its rivals can retain these savings indefinitely on behalf of shareholders, rather than being obliged by competitive pressure to pass them on to the customer. But whatever the operational risk, at least the financial risk seems to be abating. Gearing by the end of this year will be around 20 per cent. It may not rise materially thereafter. Two years ago, Sainsbury's free cash flow covered 56 per cent of its capital expenditure. The figure is now 75 per cent, and should reach 100 per cent within the next two or three years. At yesterday's 459p, the shares are on 18 times historic earnings, compared with Marks and Spencer's 22 times. Though the operational risk is real enough, it is perhaps in the price.</p>

			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Postal union backs 3.5% deal THE UCW postal workers' union is to recommend acceptance of a pay increase for more than 140,000 postal and clerical workers that will increase the Royal Mail's pay bill by 3.3 per cent, Lisa Wood writes. If it is accepted this will be the first pay deal among public-sector workers at less than the inflation rate. The deal is back-dated to October 1 and will stretch into the next financial year when the government is likely to want a severe curb on public-sector pay rises. The offer gives a basic pay rise of 3.5 per cent but the overall effect on the total wage bill is lower because not all elements of pay are increased by this. The same offer is being recommended to the Royal Mail's 4,500 engineers. Lecturers at new universities and colleges of higher education last night accepted a pay increase of 3.9% and agreed to call off industrial action, the National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education said.</p>

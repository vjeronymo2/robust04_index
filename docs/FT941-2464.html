			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / R-R to buy Pounds 14m computer design system Rolls-Royce will announce today the largest order ever placed by a UK engineering company for computer-aided design and manufacturing systems as part of its efforts to improve the design and production of jet engines. The UK aero-engine and industrial power group is buying Pounds 14m worth of CAD/CAM software and services for its aero-engine division from Computervision, the US software house. Computervision said the initial order from Rolls-Royce involved 1,000 terminals or design stations. The company added that the aero-engine manufacturer had an option to buy and install a further 1,000 terminals by the end of the decade. According to the US company the order is potentially worth more than Pounds 40m over seven years. Rolls-Royce's CAD/CAM investment reflects a growing trend in the aerospace industry, with manufacturers increasingly turning to computer systems to help them design and test products before they are manufactured, to reduce production lead times and reduce the risk of malfunctions and other teething problems. Airframe manufacturers such as Boeing of the US and the European Airbus consortium have used CAD/CAM to design what they call 'paperless' aircraft to enhance the development of complex aircraft programmes. Rolls-Royce Aeroengines in Derby has already spent Pounds 10m over the past five years installing about 700 Unix CAD workstations. Rolls-Royce will eventually be able to design and develop paperless jet engines with its software. The new system will make it possible to design, 'build' and prove jet engines electronically before any metal or composites are cut. The two companies also say they are entering into a strategic relationship. Mr Phil Ruffles, director of engineering of Rolls-Royce's aerospace group, said: 'Our new joint approach is a departure from the traditional supplier-customer relationship and is one that I believe other industries will have to consider in the near future.'</p>

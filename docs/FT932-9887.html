			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / HSE attacks Brussels on red tape THE HEALTH and Safety Executive yesterday accused the European Community of imposing a mass of health and safety legislation on member states without adequate thought or consultation. The executive is concerned that it is becoming a focus of complaints that UK businesses are increasingly subject to excessively bureaucratic regulation. It is anxious to remind the government that much of the regulation and perceived red tape originates from Brussels and not from it. As part of an exercise initiated by Mr John Major, prime minister, the executive has agreed to undertake a review of about 400 sets of health regulations to see if they can be simplified or abolished. Mr John Rimington, the executive's director-general, said the EC directives, six of which were incorporated into UK law at the start of this year, had been constructed in 'smoke-filled rooms in Brussels'. He blamed, in particular, the part the French had played in trying to get the directives to reflect their own domestic laws and said some of the provisions were 'literally incomprehensible'. The directives - which cover issues such as visual display units, the carrying of loads and the provision of protective clothing - could 'well have come more slowly and been better thought out', he said.</p>

			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Italy's Corruption Scandal: Privatisation candidates in the spotlight ITALY'S ambitious privatisation programme avoided the taint of the growing scandals until last week, when a series of raids by Milan magistrates against subsidiaries of Eni, the state energy and chemicals group, brought prime candidates for privatisation directly under the scandal spotlight. Last Monday Mr Franco Ciatti, chairman of the Nuovo Pignone turbines subsidiary of Eni, was arrested on corruption charges, along with Mr Gabriele Cagliari, Eni's chairman, who was also accused of illegal funding of political parties. On Wednesday night, Mr Raffaele Santoro, Mr Pio Pigorini and Mr Giovanni dell'Orto, chairmen of Eni's Agip petroleum, Snam gas distribution and Saipem exploration subsidiaries respectively, were detained on charges of illegal party funding and falsifying company accounts. Nuovo Pignone is one of the most prominent candidates for privatisation, while both Agip and Snam had been hoping to float part of their capital under a long-heralded scheme to bring in private shareholders. The latest developments will complicate a privatisation programme which had already received a cool response from potential buyers. Recession and unattractive strings attached to some of the biggest privatisation candidates mostly explain the lack of enthusiasm. But matters have been exacerbated by differences within the government over privatisation. Last month for example, Prime Minister Giuliano Amato tried to push aside Mr Giuseppe Guarino, his industry minister, who had become a substantial obstacle to privatisation. Mr Guarino's refusal to resign his portfolio in favour of Mr Paolo Baratta, who was later appointed privatisation supremo, highlighted the continuing strength of the political opposition to piecemeal sell-offs. Ministers hope the transfer of responsibilities for privatisation from the Industry Ministry will help get the programme off the ground. Only a handful of transactions have been concluded since the government made privatisation one of its priorities after taking office last year. And the deals which have been completed are small in scale compared with those still to be sold. Still pending are the disposals of Credito Italiano, Italy's sixth biggest bank, and Nuovo Pignone. both of which were announced in September. Another big privatisation yet to be concluded is that of the food production side of the SME foods, retailing and catering group, and the planned flotation of an initial stake in the Ina insurance group. SME should be the easiest to sell. The disposal of its food manufacturing activities - and possibly its supermarkets and catering business at a later stage - was advertised this month, and the deal should cause few problems. But it could still go awry if opponents of the sale try to use the courts to block the complex division of the group into the three or four separate companies essential to the disposals. Moreover, SME's Naples headquarters are occupied by dissident workers opposing the proposed break-up. They have prevented the retrieval of important documentation needed to pave the way for a sell-off. There are convincing reasons for the delays in bringing other transactions to fruition. For example, it is believed that Merrill Lynch, the US investment bank sounding out buyers for Credito Italiano, has failed to find a suitable candidate. Its remit has been complicated by the likely L6,000bn (Pounds 2.7bn) price tag for the 67 per cent stake held by the Iri state holding company and the public tender offer that would subsequently be required under new bourse laws for the remaining shares floating on the stock market. The sale has also been stymied by poor timing by the government. Efforts to dispose of the well-regarded bank have been complicated by the forthcoming sale of Banca Commerciale Italiana, one of Italy's most prestigious financial institutions. Many buyers, especially the consortia of domestic financial and insurance interests seen as the most likely candidates, are waiting for BCI to come on the block. The outlook for selling the big Treasury-owned IMI investment banking and insurance concern to a group of savings banks, led by Milan's Cariplo, remains unclear as the long-running saga, now well into its second year, rolls on. Nuovo Pignone should have been relatively easy to sell, given its strong reputation for turbines and compressors. However, Mr Ciatti's arrest and the fact that much of its business comes from Eni complicates assessments of its value and saleability. The works' council at Nuovo Pignone's Florence headquarters this week called for privatisation to be suspended. Plans to float Agip and Snam have also been tainted by the corruption scandal. The latest setback comes on top of existing differences in the government over Eni. While some officials want the flotations, probably involving 10-20 per cent of the shares in each subsidiary, to go ahead quickly, others are still pressing for a flotation of Eni itself. The latest wave of arrests at the group could, surprisingly, speed that process. While the next few months are likely to be turbulent, the call for a 'fresh start' - probably linked to privatisation - could prove irresistible. The blow to some of the group's most powerful subsidiaries, which were previously stressing their independence, may strengthen the hand of those calling for flotation of the group, rather than its subsidiaries. The Ina insurance group represents one of the government's most attractive candidates. Yet an embarrassing and highly public difference of opinion between the group's chairman and managing director over its restructuring means plans to privatise the company could still be delayed. Setbacks to the government's timetable mean some smaller privatisations may jump the queue. Prominently placed until last week's arrests were Eni's Savio textile machinery operation and the Agip Coal natural resources operation. However, both transactions may now be held up. Progress may also be forthcoming in disposing of some of the more attractive assets of the Efim state holding company, now in voluntary liquidation. Formal bids for Efim's big Siv glass subsidiary are expected to be invited later this month. There has also been considerable behind-the-scenes activity among potential buyers for Efim's Breda Costruzioni Ferroviarie railway equipment maker. In both cases, however, the proceeds will be little more than a drop in the ocean of the government's overall privatisation targets, given the modest financial performance of the two companies.</p>

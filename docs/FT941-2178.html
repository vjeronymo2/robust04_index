			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / International Company News: Borden forced to restate earnings Borden, the troubled US foods company, has been forced to restate its 1992 and 1993 earnings in a move that signals a broader regulatory crackdown on how US companies report restructuring charges. The accounting adjustment, stemming from a restructuring charge which Borden announced in 1992, was forced by the Securities and Exchange Commission. It is the first sign of a more aggressive approach by the securities regulators as to how companies book such one-off charges. The SEC has written in recent weeks to companies which have taken big restructuring charges to remind them that the charges must meet certain criteria to qualify. Many US companies have taken substantial restructuring charges in recent years in an attempt to make themselves more competitive. Such one-off charges, which often follow the appointment of a new management team, could allow companies to report expenses which should be spread over future years, in effect boosting profits in future years and flattering a company's earnings trend. IBM, the struggling computer giant, reported a Dollars 8.9bn restructuring charge last year after Mr Louis Gerstner was brought in as chief executive. The company could not immediately be reached for comment yesterday about the SEC's apparent campaign to police such charges more actively. Borden said that, following discussions with the SEC, it had decided to reclassify part of its 1992 restructuring charge as 'cost of goods sold or as marketing, general and administrative expenses in the years incurred'. The company said it had reduced its 1992 restructuring charge, which was originally reported as Dollars 642m, to Dollars 377m. Of the difference, Dollars 60m has been applied to 1993, causing the company to report an increased net loss for the year of Dollars 631m. The other adjustments have been reflected in the 1992 figures, and will not affect reported results in future, Borden said. Mr Lawrence Doza, Borden's chief financial officer, left the company a month ago in a departure that was thought at the time to be part of a broader management restructuring at the troubled group.</p>

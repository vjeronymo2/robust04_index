			<p><P> April 8, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. ACCUSES SOVIETS OF PLANTING 'BUGS' IN LENINGRAD CONSULATE  </P> <P> In an incident sure to add new friction to the superpower rivalry, the U.S.  government Friday accused the Soviet Union of planting electronic listening  devices in the U.S. Consulate in Leningrad.  </P> <P> The State Department said the bugs, which apparently had been in place for  years, were discovered in February during a security inspection.  </P> <P> "Such hostile attempts at intelligence gathering -- however long ago they may  have been initiated -- are deeply resented by the American people," the  department said in a statement to reporters.  </P> <P> The consulate, which opened in 1973, handles relatively low-level diplomacy,  such as assisting U.S. businessmen and interceding on behalf of Americans who  run into trouble with Soviet law. For this reason, the Soviet eavesdropping is  considered to be less damaging than electronic surveillance at the embassy in  Moscow.  </P> <P> In 1985, the State Department said that a new embassy building in Moscow was  honeycombed with sophisticated listening devices. As a result of the discovery  of the bugs, the U.S. government refused to move into the embassy from a  dilapidated building nearby.  </P> <P> </P> <P> U.S. Steps Due  </P> <P> Secretary of State James A. Baker III is expected to announce soon the steps  the U.S. government will take to assure itself that officials' conversations in  the Moscow embassy will be private. Recommendations range from tearing down the  building and starting over, to a partial reconstruction of the most sensitive  areas of the facility. The cost of demolishing and rebuilding the embassy has  been estimated at $500 million.  </P> <P> Officials said they believe the consulate can be made secure without such  extreme measures.  </P> <P> The State Department announced Friday that Baker would visit Moscow May 10-11  for talks with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze.  </P> <P> Although the eavesdropping devices at the consulate apparently were left over  from an earlier and harsher period of the Cold War, their discovery now is  likely to produce new U.S.-Soviet tensions.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration has already signaled a more wary approach to the Soviet  Union than was prevalent in the final years of the Ronald Reagan  Administration.  </P> <P> The relationship has been buffeted in recent weeks by the revelation that the  Soviet Union has sold high-performance warplanes to Libya and by continuing  disputes over Latin America.  </P></p>

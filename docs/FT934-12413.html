			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Japanese groups look to S Africa TWO business deals were unveiled yesterday between South Africa and Japan, indicating closer ties between the two in a post-sanctions environment. A joint venture was unveiled between two of the world's leading ferrochrome producers, Samancor and Nippon Denko - the first large investment by a Japanese company since the lifting of sanctions - while the fuel and chemicals group Sasol and Mitsui have formed a marketing and distribution alliance for the handling of Sasol Chemical's hexene and pentene in Japan and South Korea. Sasol will supplement the current hexene production to meet the growing demand in these markets and Mitsui will handle the marketing and distribution. Pentene is to be supplied by Sasol for production of polyethylene plastics. Mitsui will work with a Japanese supplier on developing a market for this product and other speciality chemical products in Japan and Korea. Samancor and Nippon Denko, meanwhile, have formed a joint venture, NST Ferrochrome, that produces charge chrome for the Japanese market at a 60,000 tonne per annum furnace located within Samancor's Tubatse ferrochrome plant. NST uses the Tubatse infrastructure, and chrome from Samancor's nearby mine, under a long-term agreement. Samancor executives said the fact that Nippon Denko had ceased production of charge chrome at its Hoporiku plant was a measure of their commitment to the new deal. Mr Kazuzo Kobayashi, president of Nippon Denko, said collaboration with Samancor, who had the world's largest mineral and production resources in its field, would ensure a stable and competitive supply of Ferrochrome to Nippon Steel and other major Japanese stainless steel producers.</p>

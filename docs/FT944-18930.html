			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / North Korea in nuclear offer North Korea has made new proposals in talks with the US to resolve the dispute over Pyongyang's nuclear programme, a North Korean foreign ministry official said yesterday. Mr Ho Jong said his delegation had 'put on the table very constructive and interesting ideas to quicken the solution of the issues'. He refused to elaborate. Mr Robert Gallucci, the US chief negotiator, flew back to Washington yesterday for consultations, but will be returning to meet his North Korean opposite number, Mr Kang Sok-ju, next Wednesday. In the meantime, technical discussions are continuing. Before leaving, Mr Gallucci said there had been no substantial progress in the previous week of talks but both sides wished to continue.</p>

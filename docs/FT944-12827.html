			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / This Week: Sport HORSE RACING. November 1, Melbourne Cup, Flemington, Melbourne. November 5, Breeders' Cup meeting, Churchill Downs, Louisville, Kentucky. Increasingly, star racehorses are jetting the globe for cash and kudos. Long-haul travel does not suit all racehorses, but the success of the Irish-based Vintage Crop in last year's Melbourne Cup proved an eye-opener for top owners. Vintage Crop has again been flown to Melbourne, though a leg injury last week was a worry. A better prospect in a tricksy race (the Melbourne Cup is a handicap) may be fellow long-haul traveller Quick Ransom from Mark Johnston's Yorkshire stable, who receives weight from Vintage Crop. Quick Ransom shed 18 kilos on the flight to Australia but regained most of them swiftly and is said to be spot on. In Kentucky, the 11th staging of the lucrative Breeders' Cup races - seven in total, five on dirt, two on grass, with prize money of Dollars 10m - sees the biggest overseas challenge yet. A record 26 European horses are due to appear in different races, half of them from Britain. Europe's raid is strongest in the Classic, Turf and Mile events (the latter two on grass), while Britain's brightest chance lies with flying mare Lochsong, who faces 13 US rivals in the Sprint. Only Pebbles (1985) and Sheikh Albadou (1991) have won for Britain in 77 Breeders' Cup races. The odds against a British win of any sort are quoted at a sobering 2-1. FOOTBALL. November 1, Uefa Cup, 2nd round, 2nd leg, Athletico Bilbao v Newcastle, Aston Villa v Trabzonspor. November 2, European Champions' League Group A, FC Barcelona v Manchester United. November 3, European Cup Winners' Cup, Austria Vienna v Chelsea, Arsenal v Brondby. Five English clubs compete in European this week, with the hardest task appearing to face Chelsea who are away to FK Austria Vienna, or Austria Memphis as they now prefer to be called. No English club has ever lost to an Austrian club in a European competition, but Chelsea's walking wounded could put that right on Thursday. They drew the first leg 0-0 at Stamford Bridge, and it really will be a funny old game if Glenn Hoddle's men can produce those 'Goodnight Vienna' headlines come Friday. Also in the Cup Winners' Cup, holders Arsenal take a 2-1 lead over Brondby into the game at Highbury. In the Uefa Cup, Aston Villa entertain Trabzonspor after losing 1-0 in Turkey, and Premiership leaders Newcastle are away to Athletico Bilbao. Kevin Keegan's side nodded off for a while in the first leg. After leading 3-0 they finished the game 3-2 up, and take that advantage to Spain. Meanwhile, in the big one - the European Champions League - Manchester United go to Barcelona. Over 100,000 Catalans have booked their seats in the Nou Camp, and United will be hoping for the kind of refereeing they enjoyed in the Premier League this month against Blackburn. RUGBY LEAGUE. November 5, Great Britain v Australia, 2nd John Smith's Test, Old Trafford. What happened to the invincible Kangaroos at Wembley? Great Britain's 8-4 victory over the Australians in the first John Smith's Test has had the Tourists checking video evidence to see how they managed to lose 'the match Great Britain couldn't win'. The Australians, however, will take heart from the fact that in 1990 they came back from a surprise Wembley defeat to take the series 2-1, and that it is nearly 30 years since they lost a series to Great Britain. MOTOR RACING. November 6, Japanese Grand Prix, Suzuka. The deaths of Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenberger apart, this year's Formula One title chase has been superb unscripted drama - strong characterisation and a thrilling, if sometimes unbelievable, plot. With two races to go and only five points between them, the pressure has even got to two of the sport's Mr Nice Guys, with Michael Schumacher (Benetton) and Damon Hill (Williams) hurling ever more vicious insults at each other in the press. Schumacher could clinch the title at Suzuka, but admits it is a circuit where Williams may have a power advantage. Off the track in Japan, all talk will be of who will be racing for whom next season, and which engines will power which cars. Peugeot announced last Tuesday that it is switching its engines from McLaren to Jordan for 1995. This was brought about by one of the biggest motor racing alliances for many a year, in which Mercedes engines are to be used by the McLaren team. The German manufacturer already supplies race engines to the Penske team for US IndyCar events, and both Penske and McLaren are sponsored by Marlboro. The strong tip is that Mercedes' agreement with the British team will also involve a commitment to the IndyCar series, and that Schumacher will join McLaren when his contract with Benetton finishes next year.</p>

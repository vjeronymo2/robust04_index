			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report] </F>   [Text] President Suleyman Demirel has declared that  Turkish foreign policy is not based on hostility, and the  extension of the landing strip at the airport on Gokceada should  not be interpreted as a stand against Greece. Demirel also  revealed that he informed Greek President Karamanlis in a  message that Turkey is disturbed about PKK [Workers Party of  Kurdistan] activities in Athens.    Demirel replied to reporters' questions on various issues in  Afyon today. Asked by a journalist to comment on the extension  of the landing strip at Gokceada Airport, Demirel recalled that  various problems were related to him during his visit to the  island. Pointing out that access to Gokceada is a problem, and  it takes two to three hours to go and come back from the island,  the president remarked that the extension of the landing strip  on the island is necessary for transportation.    Demirel said: The extension is not aimed at adopting a stand  against Greece. After all, the island is ours. It is our  affair how we will serve the island. Therefore, do not  interpret the matter as a stand adopted against Greece. This is  not correct. Soon, we are planning to lay the cornerstone of the  Bodrum Airport. Will this constitute a stand against someone?  An airport is a means of transportation to a corner of the  country. It does not have other motives. There is no need to  adopt a stand against anyone. For the moment, there is no such  need.    Commenting on a remark that his message to Karamanlis was  published by the Greek side, Demirel said that Karamanlis is an  old friend and this friendship is over 30 years old. He added:  Turkey and Greece have bilateral problems, but these problems  are not new. They have been inherited from the past. We want  them to be resolved peacefully. Our policy is not one of  hostility.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [TA SR report: "Ludovit Cernak Rejects Accusations"] </F>   [Text] Bratislava--"I resolutely deny and protest the  allegation that I have misappropriated some important documents  that I had signed as chairman of the Slovak National Party  [SNS]," Ludovit Cernak, chairman of the National Democratic  Party-New Alternative, said yesterday. He was reacting to the  words of Peter Sokol at yesterday's SNS briefing (a report on  which we comment elsewhere--editor's note) that important  documents, "the publication of which would not necessarily cast  a good light on the president's moral qualities or his  credibility," disappeared at the time Cernak left the party.  Cernak went on to say that, when the new SNS chairman took  office, he asked him to take over all of the documents according  to a list in the safe. When leaving the party, he handed over  to SNS First Deputy Chairwoman Eva Slavkovska documents that he  himself had taken over and other important documents that should  be filed by the SNS. According to Cernak, the specific document  mentioned at the SNS briefing was the minutes of a meeting  between SNS representatives and the then presidential candidate  Michal Kovac, which cannot bind the president in any way and  cannot be misused. After the signing of the coalition agreement  with the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia, the proposal was  made that this document be sent to the president. "I physically  destroyed those minutes because their contents had become  irrelevant. I would never use them in the way described by  Peter Sokol, nor could they be used in such a way," Cernak added.</p>

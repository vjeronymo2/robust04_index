			<p><P> March 8, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> SENATE SERGEANT-AT-ARMS ADMITS TAXPAYERS PAID FOR 6 HAWAII TRIPS  </P> <P> Senate Sergeant-at-Arms Henry K. Giugni, who administers a $115-million budget  and is the Senate's chief purchasing officer, acknowledged today he used  taxpayer funds to pay for all or part of six trips to his native Hawaii in 1987  and 1988. But Giugni said he did nothing improper.  </P> <P> Giugni, the Senate's second-ranking staff official, said in an interview that  all his trips involved at least some official Senate business, including six  during those two years to parts of the country other than his native state.  </P> <P> Giugni said he traveled to inspect security at senators' home state offices, to  check on a computer network he ordered installed, to provide security at last  year's two national conventions, and to meet senators' state office staff  members.  </P> <P> "I've got to be a people person," he said. "They get to know who the  sergeant-at-arms is when they pick up the phone. I don't want to be a name on  an ID card."  </P></p>

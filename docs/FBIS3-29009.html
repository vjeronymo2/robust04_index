Justifying  the decision, Clinton said this is the best way to determine the  fate of some 2,238 Americans missing in Vietnam. He also cited  Vietnam's return of the bodies of a number of U.S. soldiers.    Although the decision angered some organizations, especially  Vietnam war veterans and families of American POW's, it is, in  fact, a response to pressure by U.S. firms. A number of major  U.S. firms realized that the embargo on Vietnam narrows their  opportunities in this growing market. Still ruled by a  communist government, Vietnam introduced an economic reform plan  in 1989. Under the plan, Vietnam managed to grow from a  rice-importing country to the world's second or third biggest  rice exporter. Economic growth rose between 6 to 8 percent over  the past four years, and the government managed to reduce  inflation from 300 percent to only 15 percent, helping the  influx of foreign investment.    But foreign investment is largely Asian, and Vietnam does  most of its trade with other Asian countries. This stirred U.S.  firms, which see in Vietnam an emerging Asian tiger with a huge  market, a population of about 67 million, and cheap labor.  Irrespective of all the justifications made by Clinton, the  decision to lift the trade embargo on Vietnam was motivated by  the interests of the major U.S. companies.</p>

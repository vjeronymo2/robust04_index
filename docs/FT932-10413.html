			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: News in Brief AS THE housing market shows signs of recovery, special mortgage offers from building societies continue to proliferate. Northern Rock is offering a discount of 3.01 per cent off its normal mortgage rate, lasting until June 1994, where the loan is no more than 75 per cent of the property's value. For loans up to 90 per cent of value, the discount is 2.01 per cent. This results in current rates of 4.98 per cent and 5.98 per cent respectively. Borrowers must take out buildings and contents insurance through Northern Rock and pay an arrangement fee of Pounds 95. The society also is offering fixed-rate mortgages of 6.95 per cent (8.1 per cent APR) over two years; 7.45 per cent (8.1 per cent APR) over three years; and 7.95 per cent (8.2 per cent APR) over five years. All of these loans are portable. Arrangement fees are between Pounds 200 and Pounds 250 and borrowers must take out the society's buildings and contents insurance. Britannia is offering a range of fixed-rate mortgages from two to 10 years. The two-year rate is 7.5 per cent (8.4 per cent APR) for those with a 10 per cent deposit. Over five years, the rates vary from 7.99 per cent (8.5 per cent APR) for those with a 40 per cent deposit to 8.8 per cent (8.9 per cent APR) to someone with only a 5 per cent deposit. The rate over 10 years is 9.99 per cent (10.2 per cent APR). Arrangement fees vary from Pounds 150 on the two-year mortgage (not for first-time buyers) to 0.75 per cent of the loan (with a minimum of Pounds 295) for the 10-year deal. All kinds of mortgages - including repayment - are eligible under this offer. Leeds &amp; Holbeck building society has launched a range of discounts on its variable rates of 8.6 per cent and 8.7 per cent. The discounts vary from 2.26 per cent (on loans worth 90 per cent of the property) to 3.26 per cent (on 70 per cent) - but they will last only until January next year. Borrowers must pay a valuation fee linked to the value of the property, an application fee of Pounds 150 - of which Pounds 50 is non-refundable - and must also take out the society's buildings and contents insurance. Norwich &amp; Peterborough is offering a one-year fix, with the rate at 4.95 per cent for the first six months and 5.95 per cent for the following six. But this requires an endowment or pension policy to be taken out for 50 per cent of the mortgage advance. Buildings and contents insurance must also be taken out through the society. There is a Pounds 125 arrangement fee.

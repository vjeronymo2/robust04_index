			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / BR privatisation plans run into difficulties GOVERNMENT proposals for the privatisation of British Rail have run into serious difficulties over plans to split the ownership of the tracks from the operation of trains. The Department of Transport is facing the possibility of rail freight switching to road, branch lines closing, government subsidies rising and competition failing to materialise. Ministers' plans, set out in a white paper in July, are that ownership of the tracks should be left with a BR residuary body called Railtrack and that the private sector would take over operation of trains. Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, is expected this afternoon to tell the Conservative party conference that private-sector companies are queueing up to become train operators once the sell-off legislation has gone through. But the Department of Transport has yet to tell would-be train operators how much they will have to pay for access to Railtrack's lines or how much competition they will face from other companies running the same routes. In the next few days the department is to test the market, asking potential train operators to say what services they would like to run and how much they would be prepared to pay. The results will be fed into a study by the consultancy arm of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountancy firm, which the government has commissioned to devise a system of charging train operators for use of the tracks. Coopers &amp; Lybrand is not expected to produce its report until the end of the year, but it is understood to have told the Department of Transport that it has identified a number of serious problems: Freight traffic could switch from rail to road because some customers may not be able to afford Railtrack's fees. Branch lines in Scotland, Wales and Cornwall could close because the system of charging will expose the scale of their losses to uncomfortable levels of public scrutiny. Government subsidies may go up instead of down because private-sector train operators will cream off lucrative services, leaving the state to subsidise the loss makers. Competition between train operators could be almost non-existent because companies will bid for train service franchises only if they are guaranteed exclusivity. The government had hoped to introduce a rail privatisation bill in November and win royal assent for it by next summer, but the emerging difficulties threaten to delay the bill into the next session.

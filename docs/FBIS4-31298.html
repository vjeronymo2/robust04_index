			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [TA SR report: "There Will Be a General Staff"] </F>   [Text] Bratislava--The transformation of the Army Command  of the Slovak Republic into the General Staff is being pursued  within the framework of the first stage of implementing the  Concept of Building the Army of the Slovak Republic up to the  Year 2000. This change should be carried out this year but no  later than next year, Major General Julius Humaj, commander of  the Army of the Slovak Republic, told the TA SR yesterday.  Following experience with a similar arrangement of West  European armies, the change will mainly affect internal  organizational structures. General Humaj described the  formation of the Army Command as one of the mistakes made in  drafting the concept and structure of the newly established  Republic's armed forces.</p>

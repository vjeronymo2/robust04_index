			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Qaiser Butt; all quotation marks as published] </F>   [Text] The Afghan prime minister, Eng. Gulab Din Hekmatyar,  has said that he is ready to accept Prime Minister Benazir  Bhutto as a mediator to settle his dispute with President Prof.  Borhanoddin Rabbani. However, he made it clear that Rabbani  would have to resign as the president of Afghanistan.    Hekmatyar who is also chief of the Hezb-e Eslami [Islamic  Party] Afghanistan, expressed his willingness to respond in  positive terms to Islamabad's reported initiative for the  settlement of his dispute with President Rabbani, during an  interview with THE FRONTIER POST, at his stronghold Charasyab  (four miles) in Kabul on Wednesday [12 Jan].    To a question about the war situation in Kabul, Hakmatyar  said that his men had inflicted heavy losses on the Rabbani  forces. "War will continue till President Rabbani accepts our  four demands", he declared.    Hekmatyar is demanding the resignation of President Rabbani,  with the offer that he would also reciprocate. The second  demand pertains to the establishment of an interim government in  Kabul which, he said should replace the government of President  Rabbani. "The proposed interim government should be acceptable  to all the Afghan parties", Hekmatyar explained. The interim  government, he demanded, should raise a national army within six  months and all the Afghan parties should surrender their arms  and ammunition to the ministry of defence.    "The interim government should hold general elections as  soon  as the national army is raised", is the fourth demand of  Hekmatyar to end the ongoing war in Kabul and other parts of the  country.    Hekmatyar further said that he would not seek any office in  the proposed interim government. "I am not interested in the  prime minister's office nor do I want to be the president",  Hekmatyar added. "I will not accept anything, but elections.    He rejected the allegations that he was responsible for the  on-going war and said that president Rabbani was responsible for  it who, he said, was trying to have a one-party system in  Afghanistan. "It is not only the Hezb-e Eslami fighting against  president Rabbani's Jami'at-e Eslami [Islamic Society] and his  former defence minister Ahmad Shah Mas'ud's Shoora-e Nazar."    The Hezb-e Wahdat [Islamic Unity Party] of Ayatollah Mazari  and Junbish-e Milli of Gen. Rashid Dostam are also the two major  parties fighting against Rabbani and Mas'ud. Hekmatyar said  adding "The Hezb-e Wahdat and Junbish-e Milli had been a part of  Rabbani's set-up till last month.    Replying to a question about the allegations by President  Rabbani that communists were helping Hekmatyar in the war, the  Afghan premier said that by saying so Rabbani had weakened his  own case. "It is a known fact that Gen. Rashid Dostam whom  Rabbani was now calling as a communist had been one of his close  associates in government for 20 months. "Rabbani himself  declared that Gen. Dostam and other communists were part of the  Islamic army." Rabbani visited Gen. Dostam five times during  his 20-month rule. "It is also a known fact that a top  communist general Momin who was killed in war was fighting from  Rabbani's side.    Hekmatyar said that Rabbani could not mislead the people of  Afghanistan merely with such propaganda as everyone in and  around Afghanistan was aware that all the top communists of  Afghanistan such as Babtak Karmal, Gen Nabi Azeemi, Mahm'ud  Bityali, Gen Baba Jan, Farid Mazdak and Kavyani were  masterminding the policies of Rabbani's government.    Giving datails of his differences with president Rabbani  which ultimately led to the current bloody war in Afghanistan,  the Afghan prime minister said that Rabbani was suppossed to  hold general elections in six months after becoming the  president of the country under the Islamabad accord.    "I had to accept the office of the prime minister under the  Islamabad accord despite my reservations but Rabbani did not  honour the accord even for a single day. He did not hand over  the prime minister's secretariat to me and the secretariat  building continued to remain under the control of Jami'at-e  Eslami fighters. President Rabbani rejected all the decisions  taken by my cabinet without any reason. The cabinet decision  that Afghan currency will no longer be printed in Moscow was not  implemented by president Rabbani for the reason that Moscow was  keen on helping him with this currency. All such Afghan  currency was printed without any reserves as Rabbani joined  Moscow to destroy the Afghan economy. Rabbani failed to restore  peace in Afghanistan during his 20 month rule in Kabul as was  expected by him. "Kabul suffered 25 big fights during his  rule", Hekmatyar said.    He added: "On our requests Pakistan, Iran and Saudi Arabia  asked Rabbani to let the Islamabad accord be implemented but he  did not listen to anyone. He refused to listen to all of those  who wanted the return of peace to Afghanistan."    Hekmatyar also said that president Rabbani during his 20  month rule continuously instigated one party against the other.  He formally asked Gen Rashid Dostam to attack Hezb-e Eslami but  he refused. "Rabbani depended on Gen Dostam to perpetuate his  illegal rule but he refused to be a party with him any more when  he realised that Rabbani was trying to have one party rule in  Afghanistan. "Rabbani praised Gen. Dostam so long as he was  with him but as soon as he refused to be a tool in his hands he  declared him as a communist. Rabbani is on record as having  said on several occasions that Gen Dostam played a key role in  the removal of communist president Gen Najibollah," he said.    Hakmatyar added: "It was Rabbani who failed to keep his  allies. Hezb-e Wahdat, Junbish-e Milli [the National Movement]  and Afghan National Liberation Front [ANLF] of Prof.  Sibghatollah Mojaddedi with him as he did not fulfill the  promises he made with them."    He said that Hezb-e Eslami was the first to realise that  Rabbani and Mas'ud were playing in the hands of the communists.  Hekmatyar said this while giving details of the formation of a  combined force with Hezb-e Wahdat, Junbish-e Milli and ANLF.    Hezb joined us when its leadership realised that Rabbani was  responsible for instigating Hazara tribe against the Pukhtoons,  Uzbeks against the Pukhtoons, and Shlee against Sunnis.  "Similar were the feelings of Gen Dostam when he also decided  to be with us against Rabbani and Prof. Sigbhatollah Mojaddrdi  agreed with all of us". Hekmatyar said that the current  conflict would prove as the final round of war in Kabul against  those who were not willing to honour the rule of people.</p>

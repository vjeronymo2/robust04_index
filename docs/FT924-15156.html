			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / International Company News: Showdown for Austria's Giro bank  -Opposition to its expansion strategy mounts A SIMMERING row over the future of GiroCredit Bank, Austria's third-largest bank, has exploded into public view, with Bank Austria, Giro's largest shareholder, declaring publicly that it opposes Giro management's expansion strategy. The way is now set for a showdown at the meeting of Giro's supervisory board on October 15, when Mr Hans Haumer, the chief executive, is to put forward a plan to buy 10 per cent stakes in two large provincial savings banks. Giro, the former Girozentrale, has been struggling to transform itself into a universal bank following the liberalisation of the Austrian banking industry in the past two years. Giro has been the central deposit body where the Austrian savings banks have been obliged to put their excess funds, and so therefore has operated mainly as a wholesale bank, active in domestic and foreign capital markets. Now the savings banks can deposit their funds on the open market and obtain much better returns than from Giro, whose rates are still regulated. Late last year, Giro embarked on a strategy of developing its own branch network, acquiring Osterreichisches Credit-Institut (OCI) for Sch2.5bn (Dollars 259m). OCI has 47 retail branches. However, opportunities for other acquisitions are few and expensive. Recently, Giro proposed another tactic to achieve the same end - buying 10 per cent stakes in some of the larger provincial savings banks. It hopes this will encourage them to continue doing business with the central body. Giro has already agreed terms with two of these banks, Salzburger Sparkasse, in Salzburg, and Allgemeine Sparkasse Oberosterreich in Linz. And this was the point at which Bank Austria, the country's largest bank, objected. Giro is owned by 95 savings banks throughout the country. Bank Austria is the largest with a 30 per cent stake by virtue of its control of the big Zentralsparkasse group of savings banks in Vienna. Up to now, Bank Austria and Die Erste, a competing group of Vienna-based savings banks with about a 20 per cent stake in Giro, have led rival consortia of urban and rural savings banks on the Giro board, divided along partisan political lines. The result is that even though Bank Austria and Die Erste together together accounted for a majority of the votes on the Giro board, they have never acted together. At the moment they control only seven of the 20 board seats between them. However, now both Bank Austria and Erste see a common interest as Vienna-based banks eager to improve their market share in the provinces in preventing Giro from strengthening its position in the country's main provincial cities. Mr Gerhard Randa, deputy chief executive of Bank Austria, said publicly recently that he thought Giro should concentrate its efforts on its speciality of wholesale banking and that investments in minority positions in retail banks did not make good economic sense. Mr Randa recognised that the Giro board as presently constituted with a majority of votes still in the hands of the provincial savings banks might well endorse management's plans. But he said if the vote was lost on October 15, changes to the board's membership should be considered. Giro officials say the provincial savings banks would be extremely offended if their representatives were removed from the board, and they are betting that Bank Austria will not risk undermining the bank's business. 'It is a bit of a chess game,' one said. Meanwhile, Giro officials are trying desperately to change the ownership structure of their bank. It is intolerable having two main competitors as the two largest shareholders, bank officials say. But the cost of buying out Bank Austria or Die Erste would be extremely high. Last year, Giro tried to merge with Die Erste, but that failed for a variety of reasons. It has been trying for some time to attract 'strategic' minority shareholders, and is now in discussions with Bayerische Landesbank Girozentrale, the central deposit bank for a group of German savings banks, over a 10 per cent stake. Others wonder if there is room in Austria's overcrowded banking market, where there are already two large universal banks, Bank Austria and Creditanstalt, for a third. Mr Rene Alfons Haiden, chief executive of Bank Austria, says his bank will wait and see whether Giro can find any strategic partners. If not, he acknowledges that it might have to be taken over by Bank Austria. 'I am sure we can solve all the problems,' Mr Haiden said.</p>

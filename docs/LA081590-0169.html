			<p><P> August 15, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NO WEAK LINK IN S.E. CONFERENCE;  </P> <P> FOOTBALL: SEC WAS ONLY LEAGUE TO PLACE THREE TEAMS IN LAST YEAR'S FINAL TOP 10.  </P> <P> Miami was college football's team of the 1980s. But what about the conference  of the decade?  </P> <P> The strongest claim belongs to the Southeastern.  </P> <P> During the 1980s, the SEC had the best winning percentage against outside  opponents (.690) plus the most bowl appearances (56), bowl victories (29) and  Heisman Trophy winners (Herschel Walker of Georgia and Bo Jackson of Auburn).  </P> <P> Although the SEC produced only one national champion (Georgia, 1980) during the  decade, that was as many as any other conference. The SEC also led all leagues  in Top 20 appearances, and was the only conference with three teams in last  year's final Top 10.  </P> <P> "Most conferences have got two really strong programs, but top to bottom there  isn't one close to the SEC," Florida State Coach Bobby Bowden said.  </P> <P> Florida State is an independent, but the Seminoles are considering joining the  SEC. The league just lured Arkansas from the Southwest Conference and further  expansion is expected.  </P> <P> Arkansas Coach Jack Crowe said the Razorbacks will have a much harder time  winning in the SEC than they did in the SWC.  </P> <P> "We're going from first place in the Southwest Conference to fifth in the SEC,"  he said.  </P> <P> Tennessee, Auburn and Alabama tied for the SEC title last season and this  year's race should be just as close.  </P> <P> Auburn has to replace quarterback Reggie Slack, but the Tigers return their two  top rushers, highly touted offensive lineman Ed King and a hard-hitting  defense.  </P> <P> "We're not a finished product by any means," Coach Pat Dye said. "But we have  the makings to be a good football team."  </P> <P> Tennessee, coming off a surprising 11-1 season, will feature running back Chuck  Webb, the league's second leading rusher last season.  </P> <P> Alabama, under new Coach Gene Stallings, should have an explosive offense with  quarterback Gary Hollingsworth and 1,000-yard runner Siran Stacy. But the Tide  has to fill some huge holes on defense created by the departure of linebacker  Keith McCants, nose guard Willie Wyatt and cornerback John Mangum.  </P> <P> In the Atlantic Coast Conference, Virginia and Clemson are expected to battle  for the championship.  </P> <P> Virginia, which tied Duke for the league title last season, wants Moore of the  same this season -- specifically the pass-catch combination of quarterback  Shawn Moore and receiver Herman Moore.  </P> <P> Shawn was the nation's fourth-leading passer last year, while Herman set a  school record with 10 TD catches.  </P> <P> Clemson starts the season with a new coach and an old style.  </P> <P> Ken Hatfield left Arkansas to replace Danny Ford, who resigned after an NCAA  investigation of the Clemson program. But Hatfield will stick with the same  ball-control offense and attacking defense that made Clemson a national power  under Ford.  </P> <P> Despite the strength of the SEC, the two best teams in the South may once again  be independents.  </P> <P> Miami won the national championship last season, while Florida State finished  third. Both figure to contend for the national title again this season.  </P> <P> The Hurricanes' offense will be led by Craig Erickson, who passed for 2,007  yards and 16 touchdowns last season despite missing three games with a broken  finger. The team's biggest problem will be replacing Cortez Kennedy and Greg  Mark, the anchors of last year's dominating defense.  </P> <P> Florida State must replace quarterback Peter Tom Willis and tailback Dexter  Carter, but the Seminoles have plenty of talent returning on offense. The  defensive leader is linebacker Kirk Carruthers, who led the team with 145  tackles last season.  </P> <P> Last year, Florida State handed Miami its only defeat. The rematch takes place  Oct. 6 at Miami.  </P></p>

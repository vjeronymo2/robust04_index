			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Minding Your Own Business: The modern armourer - Clive Fewins visits a derelict foundry in the Midlands where an old craft is being revived ARMOURER Richard Dunk traces his unusual occupation back to the six weeks he spent in the Tower of London. It was not a continuous incarceration - he was let out each night to go home. But the 17th century Flemish armour he was working on was so valuable that it had to be kept permanently under lock and key. 'Working in the Tower armouries gave me a focus. It made me realise that armour was what I was really interested in, rather than a career in the museum service, where I had thought I would end up,' said 39-year-old Dunk. That was nine years ago when he was reading for a history degree as a mature student at Birmingham University. He gained an award for his project at the Tower, and also a grant that enabled him to start his business. The rest, as they say, is history, which has always been a passion with Dunk. After gaining his degree with the support of his teacher-wife and friends in various historical re-enactment societies, he did not need a lot of persuasion to apply his 6ft 3in frame to metal bashing of a particular nature. He thinks nothing of working seven or more hours without a break in his small workshop, a former wood store in the yard of a near-derelict foundry complex at Darlaston, near Wolverhampton. It is a bleak background in which to spend one's working hours. Dunk enjoys the solitary work. 'It is an extremely noisy process, so for the bulk of the work I need a workshop that is relatively isolated,' he said. He uses the workshop in the garden at his home near Walsall when there is less noisy work to do, or when he needs to be near a telephone. There he works on straps and linings and padded wooden stands for the the armour. 'There is really no such thing as an off-the-peg suit of armour,' Dunk said. 'All armour needs to be made to measure. But because most of my American and Canadian clients only wear it rarely, every suit needs a stand. These take quite a long time to construct.' Making a piece such as the 'Henry VIII' armour, based on a 1515 design and used for a recent series of re-enactments, is a long and complicated process. There are 34 different sections in the complete outfit, correctly known as a garniture. Some of the pieces have splendid sounding names such as cauldrons, chamfrons, combs, tassets and tumlets. 'People often do not realise that the medieval armour (people wrongly refer to suits of armour) was built for a variety of different purposes, for example war games, for use on horseback, for real battle, or for ceremonial use,' Dunk said. 'So most of them came with what you might call bolt-on accessories, to suit the use the armour was being put to on any particular day. I suppose there is an analogy with the modern all-purpose warplane, that can be adapted for a variety of uses.' All the pieces in the Henry VIII armour were hand-wrought from sheet metal and highly polished. Dunk has already made a reasonable profit from renting it out for special events, but unless he manages to rent it to a permanent exhibition he will sell it for around Pounds 12,000. 'There is probably a good home for it on the other side of the Atlantic. But, frankly, I am too busy to try and find one at present and I am not so hard up that I need to sell it,' he said. Although Dunk has a healthy order book - 1992 was quite a good year and 1993 shows signs of being better - he has no plans for large-scale expansion. 'Employing another person is difficult,' he said. 'There is no time in which to train anyone - it would cut down production time too much. 'But the work is extremely tiring, and not particularly rewarding financially. I aim at a turnover of Pounds 25,000, and because of very low overheads and the small amount of materials I use, I try to pay myself Pounds 15,000 to Pounds 20,000 before tax. 'I am aware that with demand high, I should be expanding, but this would probably take the form of sub-contracting, rather than employing someone else to work for me. What I would really like to do is make less of the standard everyday pikeman's armour - a set costs about Pounds 400 and takes me three days to make - and concentrate on the high-quality orders from abroad. 'These are more satisfying, as well as being more profitable. Everything has got to work, and while the basic material - sheet steel  - is different from the iron that the originals were made from, virtually every other detail is the same. All my reproductions are authentic copies from original patterns, many of which I take myself from original armour in museums and private collections, and from pieces that come in for restoration. I have about 200 different patterns - quite a good collection.' As well as armour, Dunk makes pikes and halberds that he sells to members of the Sealed Knot and the English Civil War Society, who re-enact battles, and also a range of period ironwork including candlesticks, candle prickets, rush-light holders, lanterns and light holders. He has even made a cannon that fires and two non-firing early 16th century replica cannon for Southsea castle, based on guns found on Henry VIII's warship the Mary Rose. Dunk organises re-enactments of battles and of Tudor life and makes armour to order for permanent exhibitions. Most of this work comes from English Heritage. He is currently working on a commission from them for exhibits at a permanent display in Etal Castle, close to Flodden Field in Northumberland, where the English defeated the Scots in 1513. Dunk rents his workshop for Pounds 100 a month and his other overheads are low. He rarely borrows. 'Really, I shall have to think about expanding to cope with the overseas market as the business is there,' he said. 'Two years ago, I approached the DTI for advice, but they did not seem interested. Perhaps it is time I tried again. I do not really know . . .' Richard Dunk, 23 Overhill Road, Burntwood, Walsall, West Midlands WS7 8SU. Tel: 0543-684726 outside office hours.</p>

			<p><P> May 29, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE TEXTBOOK SELECTION LAWS COME UNDER ATTACK  </P> <P> California's textbook adoption laws, considered by many to be a cornerstone of  the state's recent curriculum reform efforts, have come under legislative  attack from textbook publishers and other critics.  </P> <P> So far, defenders of the present system, led by California Supt. of Public  Instruction Bill Honig, seem to be winning the legislative battle.  </P> <P> "We beat it back," Honig said confidently last week, referring to what Honig  called an attempt by publishers and others "to basically do us in and cut the  process way down."  </P> <P> But others say the skirmishing continues and the final outcome is not certain.  </P> <P> Publishers and other critics say the California process is lengthy, cumbersome,  arbitrary and capricious and does not, in the end, produce better books and  other instructional materials.  </P> <P> "It's a six-month process and then they go into their little box and tell you  somebody's accepted and somebody's not but you never know why," said John B.  Mockler, Sacramento lobbyist for the Assn. of American Publishers, the textbook  publishers' trade association.  </P> <P> The publishers group is supporting a bill by state Sen. Ken Maddy (R-Fresno)  that would shorten the textbook adoption cycle from seven years to two, require  the state Board of Education to give specific written reasons for rejecting  text materials and change the composition of the state Curriculum Commission,  among other features.  </P> <P> In this form, the legislation is more or less acceptable to Honig and other  state education officials, but as originally written it was not acceptable.  </P> <P> Initially, the Maddy bill would have required the state Board of Education to  approve all instructional materials submitted by publishers within 90 days, if  they met certain minimum standards. If materials were rejected, a special panel  of experts would have had to provide a "detailed explanation of the reasons  why."  </P> <P> "This reversed the process and put the burden of proof on the board, not the  publishers," said Dan Chernow, state Curriculum Commission chair. "It was an  obvious attempt to dismantle the process."  </P> <P> The original Maddy bill "sent shock waves through the educational community,"  said Charlotte Crabtree, professor of education at UCLA and co-author of the  state's much-praised new social science-history framework.  </P> <P> "The feeling was that, nationally, educators were looking to California to lead  the way . . . to continue the curricular reform movement and this bill would  weaken our ability to do that," Chernow said.  </P> <P> At the behest of Crabtree, Honig and others, nationally prominent educators  wrote to Gov. George Deukmejian and to legislative leaders to protest the Maddy  bill.  </P> <P> The effect of the bill, and similar legislation sponsored by Assemblyman Bob  Epple (D-Norwalk), "would be to undermine one of the most promising education  reform efforts anywhere in the land," Chester E. Finn Jr., professor of  education and public policy at Vanderbilt University and a key aide to former  U.S. Secretary of Education William Bennett, wrote in a typical letter.  </P> <P> Faced with this barrage of criticism from the education community, Maddy and  the bill's supporters began to negotiate a less drastic measure with Honig and  other officials of the state Department of Education.  </P> <P> California is only one of 22 states with statewide adoption policies but  accounts for about 10% of national textbook sales, so materials selected in  California often influence the national market.  </P> <P> The state Constitution requires adoption of instructional materials for grades  one through eight. Local school districts must use the state-approved list for  80% of their textbook purchases if they want to be reimbursed by the state.  </P> <P> The yearlong process that leads to state adoption begins with scrutiny of new  textbooks by Instructional Materials Evaluation Panels, made up of classroom  teachers, "master teachers," curriculum specialists, and college and university  professors. These panels make recommendations to the Curriculum Commission,  which then proposes a list of five to 15 texts in each subject area, and for  each grade, to the state Board of Education.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Dumbing Down'  </P> <P> Many educators believe that textbook quality declined in the 1960s and 1970s,  as publishers deliberately engaged in a "dumbing down" process that was  supposed to make the books more readily understandable to the increasing number  of poorly prepared pupils who were entering the public schools.  </P> <P> When Honig was first elected state superintendent in 1982, he pledged to set  tougher standards and to improve the curriculum, including better textbooks.  </P> <P> At his urging, the Curriculum Commission and the state school board have  insisted that biology texts do a better job of explaining evolution and human  reproduction, that mathematics books relate the teaching of math skills to  real-life situations and that reading materials stress literature as well as  phonics and other basic elements of instruction.  </P> <P> In this process, many textbooks have been rejected and others have had to be  substantially revised, much to the annoyance of the publishers.  </P> <P> Open Court, a Chicago publisher, was especially outraged when both its reading  and mathematics books were rejected in California and the president of the  company, Andre Carus, "vowed then that they were going to put forward a bill to  change the process," said Glen Thomas, who directs the state Department of  Education's textbook evaluation efforts.  </P> <P> To the publishers, this seemed an especially good time to try to change the  California laws because in 1990 the state will adopt new social science and  history textbooks, based on a startling new "framework" written by Crabtree and  by Diane Ravitch, adjunct professor of history and education at Teachers  College, Columbia University.  </P> <P> No current history text is thought to be in tune with the new framework, which  Ravitch has characterized as requiring "vivid narrative accounts of American  history and world history," treatment of "major events in depth" and  "well-written biographies" of historical figures.  </P> <P> "It was simpler for the publishers to lobby to revise the process than it was  to provide better books," Crabtree said.  </P> <P> In the meantime, Washington education writer Harriet Tyson published a 1988  book that was sharply critical of "America's textbook fiasco" and of the  statewide adoption processes that Tyson believes encourage publishers to  produce bland books.  </P> <P> In a telephone interview last week, Tyson accused Honig of grandstanding in his  denunciations of textbook publishers and their products and said California "is  not leading us all into the sunlight" of better instructional materials.  </P> <P> In fact, publishers are reluctant to produce new books for California, Tyson  added, because of "feelings that the product may not be chosen for reasons of  merit" but for "political reasons" or "because of deals of one kind or  another."  </P> <P> Tyson's book was published by the Council for Basic Education, a  Washington-based organization that has been instrumental in the national  curriculum reform movement of recent years. The council, which usually does not  engage in direct political activity, then decided to lobby for legislation that  would change the California adoption process.  </P> <P> The council hired Sacramento lobbyist Jack C. Crose, who arranged for a meeting  between Tyson and Maddy -- and the legislation was born.  </P> <P> "I had thought earlier this would be a good way to get quality textbooks in  California," said A. Graham Down, executive director of the Council for Basic  Education. "Now I think it probably was an error to get involved there."  </P> <P> The council was blasted by those educators who believe that the California  adoption process is one of the few bright spots in a generally bleak textbook  scene.  </P> <P> "The council certainly picked the wrong state at the wrong time," wrote Gilbert  T. Sewell, director of the American Textbook Council, in a typical comment.  </P> <P> Faced with this kind of criticism and a split among its trustees (who had not  approved the lobbying effort in the first place), the Council for Basic  Education withdrew support of Maddy's bill, leaving the textbook publishers,  represented by John Mockler, as its leading backers.  </P> <P> This is probably why Maddy decided to remove the most controversial part of the  bill -- requiring the state Board of Education to prove that submitted  materials were not good, instead of requiring the publishers to prove that they  were -- although it is hard to be sure because Maddy did not return several  telephone calls seeking his views.  </P> <P> Both the Maddy bill and the Epple bill still contain several important  features, including:  </P> <P> * A "rolling adoption" process that would allow publishers to submit new  materials every other year, instead of every seven years, as is the current  practice. However, Francie Alexander, the associate superintendent of education  who supervises textbook adoption, said only books that are "really new and  different" would be considered between major adoptions, which would still take  place every seven years.  </P> <P> * If materials are rejected, the state school board must provide a "written  explanation of the reasons why."  </P> <P> * The books should be factually accurate and should use "teaching strategies  generally recognized as effective. . . ." Alexander said the state school board  and the Curriculum Commission have been using these criteria but they have not  previously been written into the state education code.  </P> <P> * At least seven of the 13 public members on the 18-member Curriculum  Commission should be full-time classroom teachers for grades one through eight  and all of the commission's subcommittees also should have a majority of  full-time classroom teachers.  </P> <P> This issue is of concern to teacher organizations more than textbook  publishers. "The individual classroom teacher is the most qualified person to  select instructional materials which meet the diverse needs of the learner,"  said Len Feldman, communications consultant for the California Teachers Assn.  </P> <P> But Thomas, of the state Department of Education, said it is difficult for a  full-time elementary school teacher, who usually must teach several subjects,  to develop enough expertise in any one subject to be a good judge of textbooks.  </P> <P> As amended, the Maddy and Epple bills have been approved by the education  committees of both the state Senate and the Assembly. Maddy and Mockler,  representing the publishers, are still discussing the language in the Senate  measure with state education officials, but it is possible that Maddy's bill  may reach the Senate floor in the next two to three weeks.  </P> <P> No one can be sure until the process is over, but it appears that the  publishers and other critics are expected to get only minor changes in the  California textbook adoption process.  </P> <P> Taken together, the proposed changes would "open up the process a little bit"  and give the local school districts more choice of materials, said Donald A.  Eklund, vice president of the school division of the Assn. of American  Publishers.  </P> <P> But the drastic changes that were contained in earlier versions of the  legislation have disappeared.  </P></p>

			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Travel: Doing the promenade - The sands at Deauville THE SAND at Deaville is tended like a garden.  The rubbish removal not affected by the busy flocks of gulls is completed by early morning sweepers and cleaners, brushing the wooden broadwalks, preparing the old wooden blue-and-white beach huts.  The sea is the stage for surf-divers, idle paddlers, the strongly-tanned women rhythmically performing their breaststroke rites. Promenading along the broadwalk is another rite, carried out by some ancient Egyptian erectness and measured timing.  Dogs are fashion items: coats trimmed, their top-knots tied in lacy bows, leads of special leather.  No Deauville habitue would be seen dead carting a pooper-scooper, and typical Gallic disdain for hygiene beneath the feet, pavements are plentifully dog-fouled and the back streets have an acrid aroma. For someone like me, unversed in Europe, the striking thing about this corner of Normandy is how resolutely French it is.  By which I mean that Americanisation has been avoided.  There is not T-shirt culture, no amusement arcades, fast-food outlets, structural gigantism or ghetto-blasters.  Deauville is a distillation of sensuous well-being - middle-aged, studied, borne aloft in culinary refinement. we dined in adjacent Trouville, another 19th century holiday resort sited on a long sandy beach and designed for comtemplative relaxation by the seaside.  Here the fishing boats enter a remarkably narrow channel at high tide, and disgorge their wares on to the fish-slabs on the quay.  The fish has only to cross the road to Trouville's main harbour-side street before being rendered into edible form and eaten in a string of restaurants serving a choice of inclusive menus at graded prices. Normandy is famous for eating.  The activity is treated with reverence disguised by brisk professionalism.  Previous training in French West Africa had taught me that the appurtenances of fish soup - crusty toastlets, a cheesy mayonnaise and piquant grated cheese - are assembled in a rough vessel, then launched on the rich body of the soup before being scooped up and swallowed whole. I realised the first night out that my wife and I had strayed into an eating culture with its own special rules whan a glamourous leotard-clad young woman sporting a high engagement ring came and sat beside us and expertly ransacked a large crab, cracking the claws wrapped in a napkin in her lap, stopping towards the end only to order another. With the help of a green salad and a glass of water, she then consumed a third, before getting up and briskly trotting off.  For reasons not clear, my wife explained this fastidious engorgement of crabmeat as reaction to a row with her boyfriend. It is strange, emerging from London, to walk a street with no foreign restaurants.  Exotic restaurants, yes, foreign, no.  Kentucky Fried and McDonalds may be scrambling into Murmansk and Petrograd, but their site prospectors can cross Trouville and Deauville off the map.  Who would opt for a Big Mac when a seafood started, costing the equivalent, is heaped with more shellfish than have names? Covertly, we craned round to see how the natives coped with some the these.  The answer, with dexterous movements of specialised untensils, popping little juicy shell-dwellers in between constantly working jaws. I was surprised to see salmon on every menu and in the charcuteries and fish-shops, seeing that France has almost no native stocks and they must be flown from salmon farms in Britain or Norway.  But preparation is everything, and the most ordinary lump of salmon pressed in aspic with an egg and parsley takes on a new meaning. Deauville and Trouville have become monuments to their pasts.  The new buildings, even those which are four storeys high, are constructed in traditional half-timbered style with pitched roofs.  The quantity of honey-coloured hardwood adorning these facades made me wonder where it all came from.  Whatever the source, the timber is being put to attractive use, although now its function is ornamental, not structural. The seafronts have an air of dilapidated gentility, reminscent of a grander time when this seaview mansion shutters were open and the front lawns and hedges clipped.  But it is a dilapidation never allowed to reach the point of collapse. The flaking paintwork, like Trouville's imperious but battered casino, are all totems of style.  Style is more important here.  Even the assistant trying to sell my wife a pair of shoes had developed a patter of extreme politeness that would have had as its more suitable object glass slippers rather than the objects actually under discussion. Classicism is the order of the day, even at the fairground.  The speakers, turned low, play classical pop from the 1960s.  There are no big dippers, ghost trains, thrills and spills here.  A petite merry-go-round of artistically-embellished helicopters and carriages was operated by a man with a wrinkled brown face who also worked a rag-doll from the air on a pulley, dropping within tantilising reach of delighted children as it squiggled over their heads. Art is never far away in France, and the Troville museum shows 19th century oil paintings of the beach at the height of the season. Stripey beach tents shivered on the sand, as they do still. The time had come to leave, to board the ferry at Le Havre and cross the water that separates two cultures with completely different orientations, shortly to be linked by a tunnel.  A strange prospect, Not so strange, though, as the head-long rush by returning British holidaymakers for the plates of beans, soggy chips and half-hot sausages ladled out brusquely in the ship's 'eatery.'</p>

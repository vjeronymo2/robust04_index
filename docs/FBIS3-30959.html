This is the very reason why any  interference by NATO, which sent an ultimatum to Bosnian Serbs,  would be completely wrong, Karadzic said ahead of his talks with  the Bosnian Croat delegation which began this morning.    "I have seen on television that the Serb artillery is being  withdrawn from around Sarajevo and I hope that this is true,"  Croat delegation head Mile Akmadzic said prior to the talks,  underscoring that "this will indeed be a step towards peace if  the artillery is removed."    No significant progress was made at the talks between the  warring sides during the previous two days. The essential  question--the future organization of Bosnia and its territorial  division--cannot be resolved by the negotiators at this time,  since Moslems rejected the concept of a union of three  republics, proposing instead a model of 17 cantons within a  single state of Bosnia.    The Moslem side also refused to discuss a separate agreement  on the demilitarization of Sarajevo and the placing of this city  under a two-year U.N. administration, which was proposed by the  co-chairmen of the Conference on Former Yugoslavia in order to  arrive at a comprehensive agreement more easily.    Lord Owen, one of the two co-chairmen, also warned on  Saturday that there would be no progress in the talks until the  expiry of NATO's ultimatum to Bosnian Serbs--that they would be  bombed unless they withdrew their heavy weapons to 20 km from  the center of Sarajevo by the midnight of February 20.    Lord Owen said that the Moslems would wait to see the  results  of this ultimatum, so that it will not be possible to get the  peace process moving before the expiry of this deadline.</p>

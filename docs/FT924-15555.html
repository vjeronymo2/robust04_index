			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Drink: Fond farewell to a strict mistress - Jancis Robinson and 1,900 pink roses - salutes the end of a tasting era TOWARDS the end of the night Lalou Bize-Leroy confessed it would be her last September tasting. The last time she would spend a week preparing her sumptuos Burgundian farmhouse for its annual influx of the great and the good in the wine buying and wine writing worlds. Every September since 1964 they have climbed the hills above Meursault, in their Mercedes and Porsches, to be ritually humiliated. Many of the world's more reputable wine tasters will sleep easier now, safe in the knowledge that never again will they have to participate in this famous blind tasting competition, although the wines were so good that it always seemed worth running the risk of making a fool of oneself. This year, for example, we were served 33 different vintages of the great red burgundy, Le Chambertin, back to 1933. All we had to do, as mystery glass after glass washed over us, was say which year was which. Lalou, as we all call her, as though she were our intimate, is probably the wine world's most famous woman, most famous at the moment for a bitter, public and extremely expensive dispute with her former business partner and her sister. But she is famous for far more than being the former co-director of the fabulous Domaine de la Romanee-Conti who has so infuriatingly set up her own rival Domaine Leroy along the village back streets of Vosne-Romanee. An awesome, and unusually glamorous, taster, she is passionate about her wines, and now vines, almost to the point of clinical mania. The grapes that arrive at her newly-equipped winery are treated, as she says herself, like the most tender strawberries. Showing me six men poring over the slowest sorting belt, the shallow trays in which the grapes are transported, the holes deliberately punched so that any excess moisture simply runs away, the serried ranks of brand new wooden vats and the specially-designed cruising metal substitute for the more brutal human foot, she asked helplessly: 'Surely any Financial Times reader would be horrified by the craziness of this sort of investment?' (around Pounds 8m to make hardly 7,000 cases of wine a year). In the perfectly-kept cellars below, French wine oracle Michel Bettane and I are taken on a cask-by-cask tour of the 1991 vintage. Thanks to her fastidiousness, and her gifted and compliant winemaker Andre Porcheret, they are marvels of geographical expression. But even in the one or two cases where we express the minutest reservation, we are corrected. No mother is more besotted. In the great Richebourg vineyard we are asked to marvel at the smallness, ripeness, paucity, upright stance of her 'biodynamic' grapes  - especially in comparison with those of a particularly famous holding next door . . . This is a woman whose idea of relaxation is to pit her tiny frame against a rockface. The stated purpose of her September tastings is to make her guests taste great burgundy with due attention, but it has not always felt like that. Lalou, in Chanel or perhaps Lacroix, welcomes her guests outside with a glass of mystery white, her stilettos crunching the gravel that separates her stone farmhouse from the ancient trees encircling it. In 1988, my initiation year, guests included Bocuse the chef, Broadbent the auctioneer, Duboeuf the Beaujolais, Domecq the sherry, Wasserman the broker, as well as a host of collectors and writers from both sides of the Atlantic. This year there was a significant Japanese presence - hardly surprising since Lalou's important new vineyard acquisitions have been heavily financed by her Japanese agents Takashimaya. Eventually, we take our places inside where sideboards are already charged with the lobsters, ecrevisses, wild rice, pates, sweetbreads and sweetmeats that have been pouring out of Lalou's kitchen over the last few days. (Hers is surely the only table in France where truffles are easier to find than bread.) Yet another perennial distraction from the dozens of mystery wines to come has been a heady array of flowers, this year no fewer than 1,900 pink roses in that perfect state between bud and bloom. But the most daunting aspect of the tasting is that each of the 50 or 60 guests, many of them senior figures in the world of wine, is given a notebook, from which we have to hand in to Miss a page of our guesses for each flight of wines. 'One point will be given to each correct response,' it says. Sure enough, the denouement of each September tasting has been the announcement of the 'winner'. The late Jean Troisgros usually managed more points than most, but an outsider would probably be appalled by how few points are scored. Lalou may patrol the room declaiming the obviousness of various wines but, as Michael Broadbent of Christie's, author of several wine tasting bibles, freely admits: 'I always make an absolute balls of it.' Michel Bettane, who has occasionally been top scorer, managed just 4 out of 40 one year, as did Matt Kramer, author of Making Sense of Burgundy. This year's winner, Martine Saunier, Lalou's all-important American importer identified 11 vintages out of the 33, for example. We shall all miss our annual humbling. In fact, the whole equilibrium of Burgundy seems upset by what has been a financial humbling for Lalou, who has lost the lucrative rights to sell Domaine de la Romanee-Conti wines (which used to account for three-quarters of Leroy's turnover.) In its vast and sepulchral warehouses in Auxey-Duresses, the old negociant business of Leroy still holds millions of pounds' worth of the older vintages Lalou used to buy in before turning vigneronne. She had been hoping that American guru Robert Parker would come to her tasting this year and move a bit of stock by writing nice things about those venerable Chambertins. She says that in future years she may hold some sort of tasting not at home but at the new domaine Leroy in Vosne-Romanee. It should certainly be exposed to as many wine drinkers as possible, as a shrine to single-mindedness.</p>

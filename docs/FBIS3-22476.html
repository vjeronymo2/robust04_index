Dr. J.S. Dakora, Director of the University Health Services,  told me here yesterday, that "the situation is perfectly under  control and there is no cause for alarm."    He said two students who were admitted to the Contagious  Diseases Hospital (CDH) in Kumasi, following an attack by the  disease, had been treated and discharged.    Dr. Dakora was convinced that the affected students, both  freshmen who hailed from Accra and Cape Coast and resident at  the Independence and Unity Halls, might have contracted the  disease at home.    As a routine and part of measures aimed at checking the  spread of the disease, all the halls of residence had been  fumigated, he said.    Food vendors operating at the campus had also undergone  medical screening to weed out those with chronic and contagious  diseases.    In addition, factory inspectors had been taxed to ensure  that  food vendors operated under proper hygienic conditions.</p>

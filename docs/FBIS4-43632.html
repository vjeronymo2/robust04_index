			<p>BFN     [Text] Government Spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said the  Greek Government does not rule out--at least theoretically--a  meeting with the Turkish side, but clarified that what is  important are the issues of discussion and the outcome, not the  meeting itself. He stressed that the so-called Greek-Turkish  disputes cannot be discussed, because the only thing separating  the two countries is the continental shelf. Venizelos  concluded: All the other differences are either violations or  unilateral pursuits.</p>

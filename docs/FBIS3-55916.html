			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From ELTA "NEWS BULLETIN" No. 411] </F>   [Text] Vilnius, Jan 10, ELTA -- Fragile Baltic democracies  should not be ignored, Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas  warned Western countries in his interview to British satellite  TV channel "Sky News" on Sunday [9 January].    Russia, of course, is large and influential state, he said.  But the West should not forget other states of the region as  well. Processes taking place there are important not only for  themselves but for the whole world as well. Development of  democracy in all the countries of the region should be accepted  with equal responsibility but not concentrating upon Russia.    In the end of the report, the journalist made a conclusion  that, despite reassuring words from Washington and Brussels,  Lithuania fears a new separating line on the map of Europe is  being drawn and the newly independent Baltic states are again  remaining in the wrong side.</p>

			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Bentalls cuts losses and expects fall in borrowings Bentalls, the department store operator, reduced pre-tax losses from Pounds 419,000 to Pounds 343,000 after a seven per cent rise in turnover from Pounds 33.8m to Pounds 36.2m in the six months to July 30. The group, which operates seven department stores in the south-east of England, reported an operating profit down from Pounds 480,000 to Pounds 365,000, because of a rebate on uniform business rates last year. Bentalls expects that further successful appeals against uniform business rates will result in a credit of Pounds 1.15m in the second-half results. The company anticipates a material reduction in net borrowings after a Pounds 4m refund of corporation tax and accrued interest from a capital allowance claim for the flagship store in Kingston upon Thames in Surrey. Net interest payable was Pounds 708,000 (Pounds 899,000). The group plans to spend Pounds 3m over the next 18 months refurbishing its branch stores to the standard of the Kingston store in the Bentall Centre development, which opened in November 1992. The centre's retail space is 87 per cent let, but the company receives a minimum rental income of Pounds 1.65m a year under an agreement with its co-developer Norwich Union. Mr John Ryan, finance and property director, said increased lettings in the Bentall Centre were now attracting customers away from other shopping centres in the region. Despite posting losses per share of 0.55p (0.67p), the group maintained an interim dividend of 0.6p per share.</p>

			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / Granada takes LWT stake to 20%: TV companies deny merger talks but seek greater co-operation GRANADA, the leisure, television and computer services group yesterday increased its stake in London Weekend Television to nearly 20 per cent, the maximum possible under broadcasting legislation. The deal means that Granada has invested around Pounds 84m at Pounds 5 a share in building up its stake in London's weekend television station. It electrified the ITV sector by buying the initial 14.99 per cent stake a week ago. The completion of the move - it was always Granada's intention to take its investment to the maximum - came a day before talks between Mr Gerry Robinson, Granada's chief executive, and Sir Christopher Bland, his counterpart at LWT. At today's meeting the two will explore areas of co-operation and cost saving. 'We just want to see where we go from here,' said Mr Robinson, adding that he wanted to examine opportunities for working together. Under the 1990 Broadcasting Act, the nine largest ITV companies, including Granada and LWT, are forbidden from taking each other over. The National Heritage Department, following a meeting with the chairmen of the ITV companies, is considering the case for a relaxation of the rules, but it is not yet clear whether the government has decided to make such a move, which would be controversial. A number of ITV companies, mainly potential takeover targets such as HTV and Anglia, are opposed to a relaxation of the rules. Granada's increased stake in LWT has galvanised the City. The shares of a number of ITV companies have risen on the back of takeover speculation. Sir Christopher and Mr Robinson rejected any notion that today's talks might include even exploratory conversations on a possible merger. 'You can't agree a non-bid and we don't intend to,' said the LWT chairman. Granada believes that a rationalisation of the ITV ownership structure is inevitable and views the LWT stake as 'chips' to play with if a bidding war were to break out. A takeover of LWT, with its slice of the lucrative south-east advertising market, would probably be at the top of Granada's list. If that failed, the stake might be used in a play against Yorkshire-Tyne Tees. LWT recently bought a stake in Yorkshire. Analysts have warned that ITV share prices are being held up by takeover speculation and could fall rapidly if the Government decided against relaxing the rules in the foreseeable future.

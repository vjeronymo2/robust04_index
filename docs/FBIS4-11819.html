			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Salwa al-Ustuwani: "Al-Asad To Visit Iran Next </F> Month and Might Mediate Between It and Algeria"]    [Text] Damascus -- Syrian political sources have announced  that President Hafiz al-Asad will visit Iran for summit talks  with Iranian President Hashemi-Rafsanjani on international,  regional, Islamic, and Arab issues.    The sources told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the visit will take  place in the second half of next April. They said that the  meeting will be of some importance at Arab and international  levels in view of the international changes and their effect on  the region and also because of the peace process and its  possible results.    The sources added that the Syrian-Iranian summit will also  cover the Geneva summit results and President Hafiz al-Asad's  talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton on peace affairs and the  region, the Gulf, the situation in Iran, and Iran's relations  with other states. They said that al-Asad might mediate between  Iran and Algeria in an attempt to improve relations.  Syrian-Iranian relations are believed to be strategic. They  have been allies with special ties characterized by depth and  continuity. Iran realizes to what extent these constant  relations with Syria have enhanced Iran's relations with the  Arab world and especially the Gulf states. President al-Asad's  clear pan-Arab policies have succeeded in settling more than one  dispute between Arab states and Iran, including the dispute with  the United Arab Emirates [UAE] over the three islands and  problems in Iran's relations with some Arab states such as Egypt  and Algeria. The sources said that President al-Asad will  convey to President Rafsanjani Egypt's desire to eliminate the  obstacles standing in the way of the improvement of its  relations with Iran.    The sources further said that the al-Asad-Rafsanjani summit  agenda will be full of topical issues, especially regional,  Islamic, and international issues, extraordinary developments  affecting these issues, and other matters of mutual interest, in  addition to the situation in the Gulf, Lebanon, the Palestinian  question, and the effects of the separate Palestinian-Israeli  agreements on the peace process. On the situation in southern  Lebanon, the Syrian and Iranian sides will reaffirm continued  support for the Islamic and national resistance for the  expulsion of the Israeli forces and the liberation of the south.    The summit talks will cover the situation in Iraqi and the  position of the Kurds, particularly in view of the recent change  in that position. Iran is worried about the main Kurdish  parties in the region, especially those which have close links  with the West. Iran and Syria have emphasized in past joint  statements that what happens in Iraq is an internal affair and  something for the Iraqi people to resolve. The two sides will  also review Arab-Turkish relations and the tense situation in  the Kurdish areas of Turkey.    President Rafsanjani has stressed that Iran and Syria are  opposed to any violation of Iraqi territorial integrity and  Palestinian rights.    This will be al-Asad's second visit of its kind to Iran. He  visited Tehran in September 1990.    President Rafsanjani paid his first visit to Syria as  Iranian  president in April 1991. He held talks described at the time as  very successful.    Political observers believe that Syria's participation in  the  peace negotiations with Israel, which Iran strongly opposes, has  not resulted in any Syrian-Iranian misunderstanding and that  Iran's position on this is that it is a matter related to  Syria's views on the issues of peace and the Arab-Israeli  conflict. Iranian Foreign Minister Dr. 'Ali Akbar Velayati has  stated that his country would not have a dispute with such  states as Syria, with whom it enjoys solid and close relations,  over the question of peace agreement. Iran believes that  Damascus is coming under massive pressure to sign a peace  agreement with Israel, and Iran has told Syria that it is  opposed to such an agreement and to anything to do with peace  with Israel.    President al-Asad has said that both countries share the  same  views on Lebanon and both have long supported Lebanon's unity.    Syrian sources say that President Hafiz al-Asad's visit to  Tehran will further enhance Syrian-Iranian relations and raise  them to a more special level, particularly in economic and  cultural fields.</p>

By now the region has a total afforested area of some 23,450  ha [hectares], including more than 201 ha of nurseries of young  trees and over 2.4 million economic trees.    Currently, the annual afforestation area in the region has  jumped to more than 50,000 ha from 20,000 ha in the past years,  according to official statistics.    Since Tibet began its drive for economic development in the  areas along the Yarlung Zangbo River, the biggest river in this  region, local governments have concentrated some manpower as  well as funds on the afforestation drive.    After years of hard work, a 20-km-long forest belt of some  670 ha has been formed along the southern bank of the river.    Official sources said that Tibet is one of the few regions  of  the country which have protected the environment well and  Tibet's good ecology is still in good condition.</p>

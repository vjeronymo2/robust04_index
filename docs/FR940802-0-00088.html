Further, the Department will not make this determination unless the plan contains a written statement, signed by an authorized officer or other agent of the HA, certifying that:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The dwelling units proposed to be allocated to Officers are situated so as to place the Officers in close physical proximity to other residents;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) No resident families will have to be transferred to other dwelling units in order to make available the units proposed to be allocated to Officers;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) The dwelling units proposed to be allocated to Officers will be rented under a lease that contains the terms described in &sect;905.308(e) of this part; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) The number of dwelling units proposed to be allocated to Officers under the plan does not exceed the limits set forth in &sect;905.308(d)(3) of this part or, in the alternative, any units so allocated in excess of the applicable maximum number are vacant units for which there are no Eligible Families.

The HA should attempt to establish a rent that will provide an incentive to Officers to reside in the units but that is also consistent with the limited loss of income requirement of &sect;905.308(d)(1)(iv)(B) of this part. As required in &sect;905.308(d)(1)(i) of this part, the plan must state facts and circumstances (such as, the rent that would ordinarily be charged for the unit, the HA's annual maintenance cost for the unit, the degree of difficulty in attracting Officers to reside in the unit, the extent of the crime problem in the development, and the anticipated benefits of the Officer's presence) that demonstrate the reasonableness of the rent amount.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Responsibility for damage and overall condition. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Officer shall be responsible for physical damage to the interior of the leased unit, hallway and entrance, if any, and exterior area bordering the unit.

The lease also shall provide that the Officer will move out of the leased unit within a reasonably prompt time, to be established by the lease, after termination of employment as an Officer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Prohibition on subletting. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The lease shall prohibit the Officer from subletting the unit, and provide that the unit must be the Officer's primary residence.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Applicability of the annual contributions contract; effect on the performance funding system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Annual contributions contract. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Except to the extent that an exemption from eligibility requirements is provided under &sect;905.308(c) of this part, Indian housing units occupied by Officers in accordance with a plan submitted and approved under this section will be subject to the terms and conditions of the annual contributions contract (ACC) between the HA and the United States of America. This section does not override any of the terms and conditions of the ACC except insofar as they are inconsistent with the provisions of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Performance funding system. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  For purposes of the operating subsidy under the Performance Funding System (PFS) described in subpart J of this part, dwelling units allocated to Officers in accordance with this section are excluded from the total unit months available, as defined in &sect;905.102 of this part. Also for purposes of the operating subsidy under the PFS, the full amount of any rent paid by Officers in accordance with this section is included in other income, as defined in &sect;905.102 of this part. HAs may receive operating subsidy for one unit per housing development to promote economic self-sufficiency services or anti-drug programs, including housing police officers and security personnel. An HA may request consideration of such units in its calculation of operating subsidy eligibility through the appropriate local HUD Office of Native American Programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 960_ADMISSION TO, AND OCCUPANCY OF, PUBLIC HOUSING  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 3.

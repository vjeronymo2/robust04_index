			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / International Company News: Schneider to sell components arm SCHNEIDER, the French electrical engineering and construction group, is in negotiations to sell Jeumont-Schneider, its electronic components subsidiary, to Framatome, the state-owned supplier of nuclear reactors. The two companies yesterday confirmed that they were in discussions and were finalising the terms of the sale. The Jeumont disposal is expected to be a complex deal, with Framatome retaining the company's nuclear activities but selling its non-nuclear interests to Alcatel Alsthom, the state-controlled electronics group. Jeumont produces components for use in the nuclear industry and electrical engineering. It employs 2,000 and had sales of FFr1.6bn (Dollars 290m) in 1992. The group has been considerably scaled down since the mid-1980s, notably by the sale of its telephone interests to Bosch of Germany. The Jeumont sale would include the disposal of its 47.5 per cent stake in Jeumont-Schneider Automation, which specialises in the motor sector. This company, with a workforce of 270, had turnover of FFr230m last year. The deal would form part of the ongoing divestment programme at Schneider, which is trying to reduce the debt amassed by the acquisition of Square D, the US construction company. Schneider raised FFr1bn from disposals last year, leaving the present level of net debt at around FFr19bn. However, debt-financing costs contributed to a sharp fall in Schneider's interim net profits to FFr193m in the first half of 1992, from FFr302m in the same period of 1991. The group has also been affected by the cost of integrating Square D and the problems of Spie Batignolles, its French construction company. CS First Boston forecasts a more moderate fall in Schneider's net profits for the full 1992 year, to FFr272m from FFr275m in 1991. Framatome has been trying to adjust to the decline in world demand for nuclear reactors. The decision to sell the non-nuclear part of Jeumont to Alcatel, which owns 44 per cent of Framatome, comes as a number of state-owned companies are reshuffling their interests in the run-up to the March elections, after which the next French government is expected to accelerate the privatisation programme.</p>

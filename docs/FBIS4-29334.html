			<p>BFN     [Text] The fifth session of the Ninth National Assembly  entered its 19th day today. The National Assembly devoted a  whole day to debating the draft labor code for the last time and  adopting the document chapter by chapter. National Assembly  Vice Chairman Phung Van Tuu directed the session. On behalf of  the law drafting committee, other National Assembly committees,  and the secretariat of the session, Minister of Labor, War  Invalids, and Social Welfare Tran Dinh Hoan presented the  National Assembly deputies' suggestions on the revision of the  draft labor code. On behalf of the secretariat of the session,  Comrade Bui Ngoc Thanh read the draft labor code chapter by  chapter for the deputies to debate any issues they deemed  unclear. Minister Tran Duc Hoan immediately answered the  deputies' questions.    The deputies voted on each article of the draft labor code  on  which there are still differing views. The National Assembly  concurred with the name of the draft legal document as the labor  code. At the conclusion of this afternoon's sitting, the  National Assembly voted five chapters of the draft labor code  for passage.

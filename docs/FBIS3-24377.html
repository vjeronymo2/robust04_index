			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Official Information: The Norilsk </F> Industrial Region and What It Means to Russia"]    [Text]  <H5>  Climate and Environment. </H5>   The Norilsk industrial region is situated on the territory  of  the Taymyr (Dolgano-Nenets) Autonomous Okrug.    The average annual temperature is -9.8 degrees; in January  and February the temperature can dip to -54 to -57 degrees.    Air oxygen content is 20 percent less than in the country's  middle latitudes.    The region is an environmental distress zone, as emissions  of  sulfurous gas alone into the atmosphere amounted to almost 2  million tonnes in 1993. On some days, the concentration of gas  in residential areas exceeds the maximum allowable level by 30  to 50 times. As a result, 50 to 70 percent of the employees of  subdivisions of the Norilsk Combine suffer from various chronic  illnesses.  <H5>  Transportation and Costs. </H5>   Goods are delivered primarily by water (via the Northern Sea  Route and the Yenisei during the navigation season), as well as  by motor vehicle. Several-day delays in aircraft flights owing  to adverse weather conditions result in the Norilsk industrial  region's complete isolation.    A two- to three-fold increase in charges by the Murmansk  Shipping Line in 1994 made delivery charges comparable to or  even greater than the value of the cargo itself.    The cost of an airplane ticket to Moscow has risen from 15  to  45 percent of the average Norilsk resident's pay. When a family  of four goes on vacation, there is not enough vacation to buy  tickets for everyone.    As a result of the unchecked increases in transportation  costs, food prices are rising rapidly. Up to 60 percent of all  Norilsk residents are forced to spend almost the entire family  income on food.  <H5>  Geography and Politics. </H5>   The region is administratively subordinate to Krasnoyarsk  Kray, but it is not economically linked with Krasnoyarsk. This  artificial administrative association represents a historical  anachronism dating from the breakup of the GULAG system in 1953.    The kray allocated 15 percent of all local taxes to Norilsk  in 1992 and 28 percent in 1993. As a result, the Norilsk Combine  is forced to maintain the local infrastructure and housing at  its own expense.    It would be useful to make the Norilsk industrial region  subordinate to federal authorities or to transfer it to the  Taymyr Autonomous Okrug, with taxes to be left at the okrug's  disposal.  <H5>  Industry. </H5>   The industrial region's main enterprise is the Norilsk  Mining  and Metallurgical Combine, which includes mining, enrichment,  and metallurgical production facilities. In addition to the main  production facilities, there are also enterprises producing  construction materials and structural elements, a high-capacity  construction association, an autonomous power system, research  and design organizations, and trade, public catering, and  food-industry enterprises. The combine includes the Dudinka sea  and river port, which handles up to 6 million tonnes of cargo  annually, a well-developed network of warehouses and storage  facilities, a railroad, and motor vehicle transport and  passenger services.    The combine's housing and municipal-services balance sheet  contains more than 5 million square meters of housing, more than  100 preschool facilities, 53 schools, hospitals, and other  social-structure facilities in the cities of Norilsk, Talny,  Kayerkan, Oganer, and Dudinka.    The combine employs a total of almost 137,000 people, more  than 127,000 of them in the Norilsk industrial region. The  region's total population is about 260,000.    The combine produces the bulk of Russia's nonferrous metals,  including 80 to 90 percent of its nickel, 30 percent of its  copper, 80 percent of its cobalt, and almost 100 percent of its  platinum and platinoids (almost 50 percent of world production).  In 1993 it exported for state needs alone 40,000 tonnes of  nickel, 50,000 tonnes of copper, with budget revenues exceeding  $156 million.    A drop in or halt to production at the Norilsk Combine would  have catastrophic consequences for the economy of the Norilsk  industrial region and Russia as a whole.</p>

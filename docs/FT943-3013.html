			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Samsung in Dollars 500m plans for China Samsung, South Korea's leading electronics company, plans to produce semiconductors and home appliances in a Dollars 500m project in China. The Samsung electronics plants will be located at an industrial park in Suzhou, China's fifth largest industrial city. The park itself is being built by Samsung Engineering and Construction in a joint venture with the state-owned Keppel Group of Singapore. The announcement is the latest in a number of investment projects in China by Korea's big conglomerates, designed to take advantage of low cost Chinese labour. China has become the largest overseas investment area for Korea since relations were normalised in 1992, with total investments growing from Dollars 200m in 1991 to Dollars 1.3bn by the end of June this year. Total Korean corporate investments, however, account for only 0.5 per cent of total foreign investment in China. While Korean investment in China has largely been dominated by small textile, footwear and leather companies, this year has seen an upsurge in investments by the conglomerates. Samsung will begin the manufacture of low-end application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), air conditioners, refrigerators and microwave ovens in the Suzhou complex in late 1995. The Suzhou operations will complement production of other Samsung home appliances in north-eastern China. Other chaebol with recently announced investment plans in China include Daewoo Motor, seeking to build a car components factory, and Hyundai Motor, wanting to make commercial vans.</p>

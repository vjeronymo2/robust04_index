			<p><P> March 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE BOARD ENDORSEMENTS  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Community College District is at a turning point. It has a new  chancellor, comparative labor peace and an opportunity to put into effect  far-reaching reforms passed by the Legislature. The decisions made by the  districts' board of trustees, including three members up for election April 11,  will determine how well the nine local community colleges respond to these  changes, in the way they write their budgets as well as in the approaches they  use to help both vocationally oriented students and those who want to go on to  four-year universities.  </P> <P> We are endorsing the following candidates:  </P> <P> Office No. 2 -- Rose Ochi has demonstrated as one of Mayor Tom Bradley's  assistants that she gets things done. She has shown commitment to the community  colleges both by seeking appointment for an earlier vacancy and by serving on  the screening committee that helped select chancellor Donald Phelps. Ochi is a  graduate of Los Angeles City College who transferred to UCLA and later earned  both master's and law degrees. She understands the vital transfer role of the  community colleges and their importance as an entry point for immigrants.  </P> <P> Her opponent, Mary Louise Longoria, has solid education credentials, but we  think Rose Ochi has already proved her leadership and her concern for community  colleges.  </P> <P> Office No. 4 -- Attorney Lindsay Conner, running unopposed for a third term,  has helped the district develop better relations with its teachers' union. He  also has tried to tighten the performance of each campus in recruiting and  retaining students, and deserves a vote of confidence.  </P> <P> Office No. 6 -- Althea R. Baker chairs the counseling department at Mission  College. An attorney as well, she served as chief negotiator for the American  Federation of Teachers local in its bargaining last year with the trustees.  That union is widely perceived as having heavy influence on the college  trustees, but it is a union that seems now to want to work more smoothly with  the college administrators while still standing strongly for better pay and  working conditions. Baker and her colleagues successfully negotiated a new  contract in six weeks instead of the six months of confrontation that had been  the norm. All seven of the current college trustees have endorsed her for this  election.  </P> <P> Baker's principal opponent, Patricia Hollingworth, a teacher at L.A. Trade  Tech, has good credentials, especially in the area of community college  financial management. But Baker has a track record of commitment.  </P> <P> We believe that with the addition of Rose Ochi and Althea Baker and the  reelection of Lindsay Conner, the community college trustees will gain strength  for tackling the changes they face in the coming years.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SEPARATION ENDS FOR MORGAN, DAUGHTER  </P> <P> Dr. Elizabeth Morgan was reunited with her 7-year-old daughter, Hilary  Foretich, over the weekend in Christchurch, New Zealand, after a 2 1/2-year  separation brought about by the broken family's custody dispute.  </P> <P> Morgan, who had been in Auckland, New Zealand, for the past two weeks  conferring with her New Zealand lawyer, flew to Christchurch on Saturday and  joined her daughter and parents, Bill and Antonia Morgan, at the Diplomat  Motel, where the Morgans have lived with Hilary for 18 months.  </P> <P> Neither Morgan nor her lawyer disclosed that she would be traveling to  Christchurch, and neither would comment on whether she intended to stay there  or return to Auckland.  </P> <P> Morgan's refusal to allow visits with Hilary's father, Dr. Eric Foretich, who  Morgan accuses of sexually abusing their daughter, led to Morgan's spending 25  months in jail for contempt of court. Morgan sent Hilary into hiding rather  than allow visits with Foretich, who denies his ex-wife's allegations.  </P></p>

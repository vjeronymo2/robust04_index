			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / US Ford plant may build new Jaguar THE UK workforce at Jaguar, Ford's luxury car division, will face competition from at least one rival Ford plant in the US to build the new 'small' XJ200 saloon for launch in 1998, it was acknowledged yesterday. Executives at Jaguar's Coventry headquarters said they still considered the UK to be the most likely production centre. The new car is intended to be built at a rate of up to 70,000 a year. Jaguar said yesterday: 'We will have to go to the Ford board with a recommendation as to where it should be built, based on tightly researched comparisons between the West Midlands and possible US plants.' A decision is still nearly 18 months away, but the centre of gravity of Jaguar's sales this year has started moving strongly towards north America. Jaguar expects the US to be by far its largest single market this year, and to account for about 14,000 of a projected world total of 29,000 sales. That is twice the likely sales level in the UK, Jaguar's next biggest market. Performance in the US is being enhanced by an order worth Pounds 16m for 500 XJ6 saloons from the Budget car rental group. The order, announced yesterday, gives Jaguar a foothold in North America's huge luxury car rental market. The deal was described by Jaguar's North American president, Mr Michael Dale, as 'a major breakthrough'. The 36 per cent rise in US sales so far this year, coupled with an extended summer shutdown while a new assembly line was commissioned, has left Jaguar short of stock and has led to temporary overtime working. Sales in the UK have also risen this year, by 16 per cent to 4,825 by the end of August, but Jaguar has been unable to escape the effects of the steep slump in the continental European car market.</p>

			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Technology: Smart ways with tissues - Worth Watching An entire generation of 'smart' tissues and cloths are now on the way which could help with polishing the furniture, inhaling medicines or applying cosmetics. They incorporate micro-sponges, minuscule blobs of polymer, structured like a sponge and can hold lotion or oils. The first smart wipe - a baby wipe - took Scott, makers of Andrex toilet tissue, eight years to develop. Each wipe contains 35m micro-sponges, inside which is a lotion containing dimethicone, a barrier to moisture which should help prevent nappy rash. The lotion is released when gentle pressure is applied to the wipe during use. Scott: UK, 0342 327191.</p>

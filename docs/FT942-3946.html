			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Investors need not fear instability, says Bhutto / Interview with Pakistan's prime minister Ms Benazir Bhutto, Pakistan's prime minister, said yesterday the country was now free of the political instability that had plagued it in the last five years and urged foreign companies to invest. 'Pakistan today has real democracy and real stability,' Ms Bhutto said in an interview yesterday. 'People have begun to realise that Pakistan has returned to full democracy.' She dismissed suggestions that the military, which ruled Pakistan until the death of the dictator General Zia ul-Haq in 1988, was still active in politics. She said the army leadership was now 'neutral', siding neither with Ms Bhutto nor with Mr Nawaz Sharif, the main opposition leader and former prime minister. Mr Sharif's government collapsed last year amid arguments with the army and with the president. Months of political turmoil culminated in a general election and Ms Bhutto's return to power. Speaking a few days after the government announced its budget last Thursday for the year starting in July, Ms Bhutto said she was trying to make Pakistan an 'investor-friendly country'. Building on the steps taken by Mr Sharif and his temporary successor Mr Moeen Qureshi to liberalise the economy, the budget includes cuts in import duties and the introduction of full convertibility of the rupee on the current account. The government also plans to keep a tight rein on borrowing  -after cutting the fiscal deficit from 8 per cent of GDP at the end of Mr Sharif's rule to 5.4 per cent now, ministers intend further cuts to 4 per cent in 1994-95. Ms Bhutto said foreign investment could play a leading role in Pakistan. 'Some Pakistanis are very sceptical about foreign investment in Pakistan but I think it is because they are not aware that the world has changed so dramatically, and in the 21st century we are going to be witnessing a global economy. We have to try to prepare Pakistan to compete with that global economy and integrate with that global economy.' Ms Bhutto said she was very encouraged by the response from foreign companies. Last week, ICI Pakistan, the 61 per cent-owned affiliate of ICI, the British chemical group, announced plans for a Dollars 350m (Pounds 233m) plant to produce pure terephthalic acid, a raw material for making synthetic fibres. The plant, to be funded by a rights issue and loans, will be one of Pakistan's largest industrial investments. Also, international bankers and fund managers are close to giving final approval to a Dollars 2bn oil-fired power station to be built on the Hub river, which is being financed by a combination of public and private finance. Officials said yesterday the scheme's promoters, including the World Bank, hopes to secure financial commitments by the end of July or early August at the latest. Equity investors, which are putting up Dollars 320m, include National Power, the British generating company, which last week agreed to raise its stake from Dollars 40m to Dollars 90m and assume management control from a consortium which has run the project until now. Ms Bhutto said that with the help of the Hub river project and other schemes, the government planned to increase electricity output by 50 per cent in five years from about 10,000MW in 1993-94. 'Ridding the country of power cuts is the major concern.' The government expects the economy to grow by 4 per cent in 1993-94 after 2.9 per cent last year when agriculture suffered from drought and a pest attack on cotton, a principal export. The government predicts a 1994-95 recovery to 7 per cent. Ms Bhutto said: 'Much depends on weather and crops but given good weather and good crops I think Pakistan will be in a good position by next year. So if within 18 months we can bring real economic stability we would feel proud of that achievement.'</p>

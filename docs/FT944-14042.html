			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Name change for Abbey Panels Abbey Panels Investments, the Coventry-based engineering company, has changed its name to Loades following an extraordinary meeting yesterday. The company designs and manufactures components for the motor, aerospace, and defence industries and has reported losses for the past three years. The name change comes after cuts in orders from large customers in the aerospace and defence sectors and a round of redundancies as the company has moved to cut costs. In a letter to shareholders, Mr Tony Loades, chairman, said that the new name would be used to help promote the company. He said the original name 'implies a limited range of activities and can give an understated impression of our capabilities'. In the year to September 1993, the group incurred pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.38m on turnover of Pounds 12.3m.</p>

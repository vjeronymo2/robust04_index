			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / International Company News: Semi-Tech boosted by Singer SEMI-TECH (Global), the Hong Kong company which controls the Singer sewing machine group, achieved a 70 per cent jump in profit attributable to shareholders to HKDollars 771m (USDollars 99.1m) in the year to January 1992, from HKDollars 453m in 1991. The figures included a one-off profit of HKDollars 268m from the public offering of shares in Singer, which was listed in New York in August 1991. The Semi-Tech results reflect another strong performance from its US subsidiary, which increased its share of the world sewing machine market to 37 per cent and also reported a 28 per cent increase in sales of consumer durable products. Turnover increased from HKDollars 8.63bn to HKDollars 9.37bn, largely due to the marketing of new Singer branded products. A final dividend of 2.8 cents a share is recommended, making a full-year payout of 3.8 cents, against 2.7 cents in 1991. Mr James Ting, executive chairman, said: 'Given our strong cash flow, total elimination of acquisition-related debt and diversified low cost manufacturing sources, in combination with Singer's proven global marketing prowess, the outlook for the current year continues to be favourable.' The group aims to pursue this strategy with its investment in another fallen giant, Sansui Electric, in which it has acquired a 19 per cent stake from the collapsed Polly Peck International group. Semi-Tech's Hong Kong partner in the deal, Grande Holdings, is to streamline the production process, making use of low cost facilities in Southern China, while Semi-Tech will utilise the 30,000 distribution outlets of the Singer network to provide a wider market for Sansui products.</p>

Enemy forces bombarded the  western and central sectors of south Lebanon this morning.  Israeli gunboats cruised off the Lebanese coast in south  Lebanon and enemy helicopters strafed several areas.    At 1115 today a resistance group attacked Bra'shit and Bayt  Yahun posts and reports say they scored direct hits on both  posts. Zionist enemy forces bombarded Bra'shit, Tibnin, and  Haddatha. More than 10 shells landed in Bra'shit. The  townships of al-Mansuri, Majdal Zun, Buyut al-Sayyid, and Zibqin  came under sporadic artillery barrage that continued until noon  and caused heavy property damage. An Amal resistance group  retaliated by attacking the Jisr al-Hamra' and claimed the  destruction of a 12.7-mm machine-gun post.    According to later reports from Tyre, the Islamic Resistance  attacked two enemy posts in al-Hamra' and Radar Hill this  morning. During the attack, resistance men detonated explosive  charges near enemy patrols in the two villages. Hostile  helicopters strafed the towns of a-Mansuri and Buyut al-Sayyid  along with hostile gunboats. Hostile warplanes flew several  sorties over the south this morning.</p>

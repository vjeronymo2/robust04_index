			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Parliament Chairman Ceslovas Jursenas has advocated  a national referendum to determine Lithuania's future relations  with NATO. Neither the president nor the parliament should  decide whether Lithuania should join NATO. It must be done by  the nation, he said.    According to the chairman, Lithuania would limit its  sovereignty by joining NATO. Therefore, it should hold a  referendum like some Western countries did before joining the  Maastricht Treaty, the parliament chairman noted.    In addition, the NATO-option should be co-ordinated with the  national security plan and discussed in the context of  Lithuania's entire foreign policy. Mr. Jursenas suggested the  parliament hold an extraordinary meeting before Christmas or in  early 1994 to discuss the problems.</p>

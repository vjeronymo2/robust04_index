			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 9 (YONHAP) -- On May 18, 1980, the people  of Kwangju rose up against a group of Army officers who seized  power for what was to become the Fifth Republic, leading to  hundreds of citizens being killed or injured in clashes with the  Army.    "The May 18 Kwangju Democratization Movement" marks its 14th  anniversary this year with a civil movement in place to shed a  new historical light on the tragic incident.    As part of the movement to paint a true picture of the  incident, dissident groups and some opposition lawmakers are  moving to file a criminal suit against former Presidents Chon  Tu-hwan and No Tae-u and others who allegedly led the Army's  suppression of the Kwangju uprising, apparently encouraged by  the Kim Yong-sam government's efforts to "re-evalutate  historical incidents."    These groups formed in March "the national committee looking  into truths of the May 18 uprising and upholding the uprising's  spirit" to prepare programs marking the incident's 14th  anniversary.    The committee is comprised of over 300 members representing  religious, political, academic and journalism circles as well as  victims of the incident, and the co-chairmen include Christian  pastors Kang Sin-sok and Kim Sang-kun and Rep. Kim Won-ki of the  opposition Democratic Party.    The committee will hold memorial services on May 12 for  those  killed in the uprising at Kwangju's Mangwol-tong cemetery, where  they now lie in peace, to avoid crowds of visitors on the  anniversary day.    On May 13, the committee will hold a press conference in  Seoul to demand judicial action against former Presidents Chon  and No and others accused of killing and injuring Kwangju  residents during the uprising.    It will also call on the government to delve into the truth  behind the incident, saying President Kim Yong-sam's civilian  government has not yet shed a full light on the tragedy.    After the press conference, representatives of the committee  will visit the public prosecutor's office to file a criminal  suit against 34 persons accused of being responsible for the  deaths and injuries, including former Presidents Chon and No,  together with a petition signed by Chong Tong-nyon and 319 other  victims for judicial action against the 34.    Rep. Chong Sang-yong of the opposition Democratic Party, who  sits on the committee, says shedding a new historical light on  the May 18 Kwangju democratization movement should entail  punishment of those responsible for the tragedy.    The committee will then hold an academic conference in the  National Assembly on May 14 to re-evaluate the historical  significance of the Kwangju democratization movement and divulge  the "fictitiousness" of the Kim Yong-sam government's probe of  the Army's suppression of the movement.    The conference will also deal with the issue of punishing  those responsible for the armed suppression of the uprising, a  committee official says.    The national committee will focus its 14th anniversary  programs on a historical re-evaluation of the Kwangju  democratization movement, with a view to giving it a proper  position in history, another committee official says.</p>

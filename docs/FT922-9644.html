			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / US calls on CSCE to exclude Serbia THE US and other western countries yesterday stepped up the pressure on Serbia by refusing to recognise it as the legal successor of the former Yugoslavia, and calling for its exclusion from the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) The moves to isolate Serbia - and Montenegro, its tiny ally - came as CSCE members met in Helsinki to discuss the civil war in the independent republic of Bosnia-Hercegovina and as European Community officials tried to consolidate the latest ceasefire there. Mr Haris Silajdzic, Bosnia's foreign minister, repeated his plea at the CSCE meeting for some form of military intervention from the international community. But several west European countries were sceptical about intervening. Growing international criticism of Serbia coincided with the reconvening of the EC peace conference in Brussels. Although Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the president of Bosnia-Hercegovina, remained in Sarajevo, the talks were attended by President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia and President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia, who over the past year have held secret negotiations on dividing Bosnia. The EC-brokered ceasefire was agreed on Tuesday just hours after Mr Marrack Goulding, the United Nations special envoy, arrived in Sarajevo to assess whether any UN peace-keeping forces would be sent. Mr Goulding, whose convoy came under fire last Tuesday, was yesterday again attacked. Radio Sarajevo said a bullet hit the envoy's car. In other parts of the republic, there were reports of heavy fighting. Radio Sarajevo said Mostar, southern Bosnia, was pounded by some 500 grenades. Radio Belgrade reported fresh clashes around Zvornik, eastern Bosnia, one of eight mainly Moslem towns seized by Serb irregulars on or near the River Drina, Bosnia's eastern frontier with Serbia.</p>

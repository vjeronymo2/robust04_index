			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Management: Russian reformers use their loaf - The role of the humble plastic bag The renewal of the former Soviet Union suggests vast projects, grand plans, the disbursement of fortunes. Actually, two small tables with two little piles of plastic bags are what it can come down to. They stand at the end of a production line in Moscow's Vikhino bread factory: 30 times a minute, two women pick up a baton of the standard white bread, slip open a bag, put in the bread, and fasten it with a tab dispensed from a spring-loaded magazine. Low-tech with high hopes for large returns. Reforming the Soviet Union may as well start with bread since a high value is placed on its uninterrupted arrival in the shops. In spite of hectic warnings throughout the winter about food shortages, the problem has not been a lack of the basic ingredients, especially grain, which has been bought on credits from Canada and the US. Much more worrying is the equipment in the factories - some of it pre-1939 and needing constant attention, with no funds available for wholesale replacement. Moscow's bread industry is a simple one. Five mills deliver flour to 24 bread factories and 38 bakeries: they in turn produce an average of 2,400 tonnes of bread a day for 1,420 ordinary and specialist bread shops. Consumption is lower, however, because there is a lot of waste, although the average person still eats 131 kg a year, some 14 kg a year higher than the Ministry of Health recommends as healthy. The factories turn out a range of bread: the standard white batons like small French loaves: a chewy brown loaf; a range of special breads; and cakes and pastries. In Vikhino, the machinery is relatively modern, but the factory rather dirty. While I was there, one bread line was out of action, with some 20 engineers ripping it apart for overhaul. In the loading bay, trucks with 'Khleb' (bread) stencilled on their peeling sides line up for loading: there are three bays, though only one is in use, the others being blocked with broken down equipment. In the factory itself, there is the impression, common to all post-Soviet plants, of a great many people doing not very much. A woman by one production line was tending a little pot on a fire beneath one of the ovens which contained her lunch. A pile of plastic screens - originally put up to separate out the manufacturing processes - lie in one corner, with much of the plastic ripped away, stolen by the workers. Of 1,000 workers, less than 100 are employed on the production line: the rest work behind stained doors with titles like 'legal department' and 'economic department'. In one office stand two telephones which are staffed between seven in the morning and three in the afternoon. During that time, they ring constantly as managers from the bread shops file their daily orders. Any shop which does not get through during these hours, or calls after them  -a common occurrence  - does not get its daily bread. There is no such thing as standard ordering patterns. The Moscow Bread Company was aware of its problems: in October last year, Andersen Consulting started to examine the production and supply system, with a view to implementing change. The Andersen team - led in Moscow by Stephen Zatland who was assisted by managers from Rank Hovis McDougall and the APV baking machinery group and paid for by the British Know-How Fund - has now completed the examination. Zatland and his team found that the standard white loaf had a fresh life of about 16 hours from when it left the ovens. They also found that some of the bread was stale before it even left the factory, since some batches stood in the loading bays for much of the day or night before being loaded. Even if despatched quickly, the loaves arrived in the shops with only a few hours of freshness left. Indeed, in all Russian bread shops, little spoon-like instruments are provided so that customers can press the loaves to see if they are worth buying. If the bread is stale, the shop may have no saleable bread for hours: hence people must wait in line to get something edible. The Andersen team came up with plastic bags. Plastic bags, says Zatland, prolong the eating life of a white loaf from 16 hours to two or three days. However, plastic is a prized commodity in the former Soviet Union. In western Europe, packaging is a Dollars 50bn industry, but in the Soviet Union it hardly exists. Where 95 per cent of food is packaged for sale in the advanced economies, in the former Soviet Union, the figure is around 2 per cent. Thus, when plastic bags were proposed for the bread, the bags themselves could not be found in Russia (though a supplier is now going into business to meet demand): the bags on the Vikhino line are supplied by BP. Richard Budd, the Andersen consultant who works in Vikhino, has ensured that the bread to be packaged is the best and freshest on the racks. He has the packaging rate up to 30 loaves a minute on two of the three shifts of the 24-hour day. Cheerful amid the noisy gloom of the factory, he says that 'this is one of the most forward thinking factories we've found: very progressive. They think strategically here - that's why we chose it for the bags'. Vladimir Panichev, the director, experiments with different types of bread and rolls in small batches between the standard loaves. But because bread prices are still fixed while cake prices are free, he has tended to switch resources into the latter to reap higher profits. He has managed to develop a staff which does at least some work. The sale of the packaged bread is being market-tested with the aid of questionnaires: not surprisingly, people said they would certainly buy a loaf in a bag - since the bag itself is a free gift. There was resistance to paying extra for it, since the price of bread itself has gone up sharply and will go up still further. However, the Andersen team decided to put an extra rouble on the price of the loaf to show that there is no such thing as a free anything. Other changes are also being made - one of them training shop staff in basic courtesies. Moscow shop assistants are famous for their rudeness: a raw, full throated hostility can meet a customer who, for example, asks for something that is not available, or is slow to produce money. The Andersen people believe they may even get the shops to abolish the three-queue system: one to find out what is available, and to discover its cost; a second to queue at the cash desk to acquire a slip for the correct amount of the purchase; and the third to exchange the slip for the commodity. Zatland found that there was no one in the factory who could see the overall picture. 'Everyone we met in the industry at senior management level was knowledgeable, but only about his own sector,' says Zatland. 'The head of the transport division had ideas about better transportation: the people at the mills had ideas about milling.' He would like to see the appointment of a 'Mr Bread' for Moscow, perhaps even for Russia. Mr Bread would be charged with producing the big picture and making the pieces fit within it. Bread works in Moscow: but it works badly, scraping by on antiquated machines and crazy systems. Skilled engineers curse clapped out lines, keeping them going only with a vast expenditure of energy on waiting, shouting and abusing. Getting Muscovites their bread freshly, quickly and cheerfully would be a labour of Hercules: yet it is one of the easier challenges in this raucous and desperate museum of socialist economy.</p>

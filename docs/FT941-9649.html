			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / Brown says share options cost Pounds 100m in lost tax Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, said yesterday that executive share option schemes were costing the country Pounds 100m in tax relief. Mr Brown was responding to a report in the Mail on Sunday that the 57 most senior directors of the 12 regional electricity companies stood to gain more than Pounds 18m on the exercise of executive share options granted when their companies were privatised. 'We are losing twice over,' said Mr Brown. 'We are paying higher prices for electricity as a result of the granting of these options and we are giving tax relief on the share options.' Mr Brown said the government was giving away Pounds 100m in tax relief by treating the proceeds of executive share option schemes as capital gains rather than income, 'which it clearly is'. Revelations about the size of the profits the electricity company chiefs stand to earn comes as opposition from large institutional shareholders is increasing. Last week Mr John Cahill stepped down as chairman of British Aerospace and will earn Dollars 4.7m (Pounds 3.2m) in the form of share options. Share options are designed to focus executives' attention and tie their compensation more closely to their companies' fortunes. But shareholders are increasingly concerned that the rewards go too far. The size of the regional electricity company profits may be particularly embarrassing for the government as well. The options were granted soon after the they were privatised in 1990 and became exercisable from late last month. The share prices have all risen to levels at least double the exercise price of the options. All the companies have managed to reduce costs on a scale not imagined when they were privatised and all produced sharply higher profits when they reported interim results late last year. But Mr Brown questioned whether the executives, who would become 'the first privatisation millionaires', were justified in having the options: 'It is the monopoly position that has been the advantage to them rather than their own ingenuity or efforts.' The electricity companies were unmoved yesterday. Eastern Electricity said: 'Share options are a fundamental and necessary part of executive remuneration for all top UK companies. They focus directors' attention on shareholder value.' Midland Electricity said its 'executives' efforts' had lifted profits.

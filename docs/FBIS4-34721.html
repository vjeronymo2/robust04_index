			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by President Fidel Castro with unidentified </F> domestic correspondents at the conclusion of the Fourth  Ibero-American Summit in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, on 16  June -- recorded]    [Text] [Correspondent] Commander, how does this summit  differ from previous summits?    [Castro] I cannot say that there are paramount differences  between summits. Progress was made at all of them, and  altogether they represent something positive. The summits are  being honed. We are never fully satisfied with everything  discussed or said at the summits. Yet, the fact that the  summits are taking place is an important step in Latin American  history. As I told representatives of the solidarity groups  today, it is the first time in history that we have met or held  meetings without consulting third party countries because this  is the fourth meeting we have held.    These Latin American summits have been consolidated; they  have been institutionalized. Each one has made a contribution,  fostered certain accords, and promoted specific results. There  are specific results and a general result. They have fostered  greater awareness, understanding, and a spirit of cooperation  among Latin American leaders. This is reflected in the diverse  steps the Latin American peoples are taking toward integration.  The value of the summits does not lie in what is accomplished,  but in what is fostered. The summits have truly fostered a lot.    I liked this summit. Guadalajara was first; Rio was also  good; some things came out of Spain. The Caribbean atmosphere,  Cartagena's atmosphere, hospitality, spirit -- although also  present in Rio and Guadalajara -- contributed to this summit.  We felt closer to our climate and character.    You can see how important these summits are by the fact that  they have prompted the Miami summit. Our northern neighbors are  worried and envious of the fact that this movement continues to  advance and has attained specific results in establishing  subregional integration mechanisms. Therefore, they want to  have their own. We do not know if they want to hold it  annually. Of course, they began by excluding us, which is a  clear act of cowardice. They fear debate and discussion. They  fear the truth.    They know that I would go to the summit even if it were held  in the very city of Miami. I would go to the summit [words  indistinct] because it is an opportunity. One cannot reject an  opportunity to have the Latin American and Caribbean peoples go  there and talk with the alleged masters of this hemisphere. I  hope they have enough spirit and courage. There are always  certain courageous men that will express certain truths at that  summit and defend the many interests of Latin America and the  Caribbean.    This summit has the characteristic that it was held before  that one, although nothing was actually said about that summit  because one of the goals in a summit like this is to discuss  what Latin America will jointly propose there, in Florida. The  issue was not discussed, however. That would be asking too  much. Nevertheless, I decided to dedicate practically  three-quarters or, better yet, my entire speech to analyzing  that fundamental issue, the Miami summit, and to introducing  some ideas, which you have heard.    [Correspondent] Commander, Cuba has been present at the four  summits. What has Cuba's contribution been in these summits and  how have these summits benefited Cuba?    [Castro] Well, I would say that Cuba has made a contribution  with its very presence. Its presence there is something that is  exceptional, new, and unprecedented. For the first time, there  was no exclusion. Mexico had much to do with that, as well as  our other important Latin American friends. Therefore, Cuba's  presence gives the summit more seriousness and dignity because  the cowardly exclusion is no longer committed.    Cuba freely stated its viewpoint, opinion, and criterion.  You know how these summits are: there is a public part and a  private part; you speak once and you speak many other times.  Cuba has participated in all the meetings on different issues.  It pointed out the importance of education, health care,  scientific research, and social development. We can say today  that social development issues are gaining importance at these  summits. We can say that one of the characteristics of this  summit was that we finally began to speak of social development  and to talk extensively.    Cuba's presence helps this. We have truly striven to lift  the spirit of the summits and to give them substance. The Cuban  delegation has nothing to regret about each of its statements at  these summits. All of these summits have been serious, correct,  and just, particularly this summit since we face the famous  Miami summit. We began to discuss the Miami summit. These  summits have obviously created an awareness.    One of the fruits is that they have created an awareness  about integration. We should not measure them by material  things as much as by the awareness they have created and the  rapprochement they have caused, the contacts they have  originated between Latin American leaders. This is what I say  the summits have obtained from Cuba's modest contribution. Cuba  has made a modest contribution in these areas.    You asked about contributions to Cuba. The summits have  helped counter Cuba's isolation and create an awareness against  the blockade. They have helped teach the United States a  lesson. They make its decision to exclude Cuba even more  ridiculous. In other words, Cuba has also enjoyed the benefits.  It has improved its relations with Latin America, and it has  found a more favorable atmopshere for economic relations and  trade in many areas. The summits have allowed us to establish  contacts with many Latin American leaders, politicians, and many  valuable people in the political sector. This has helped Cuba  get closer to Latin America and develop its relations with Latin  America. Those are some of the benefits for Cuba. I cannot  tell you there have been specific economic and material results,  but great results have been immediately evident. We are working  not only for the present, but also for the future. Even then,  Cuba achieved important results at these Latin American summits.    [Correspondent] Commander, even when the main topic of this  summit was the Latin American economy and integration, in your  opinion, what are the greatest obstacles which currently prevent  Latin America's integration?    [Castro] The United States is the main obstable. The United  States wants to disintegrate it. The United States opposes real  Latin American integration, where Latin American countries move  on their own and as independently as possible toward  integration. The United States sponsors bilateral integration  with different Latin American countries. Almost the same thing  happened with the external debt. The United States refused to  allow a coordinated Latin American discussion. The United  States does not want to allow a coordinated discussion in Latin  America. It wants to reach agreements with countries, one by  one, to adjust them to its specific interests and, in this way,  prevent true Latin American unity.    What happens is the United States wants one thing, and  another thing may happen because the Latin American countries  are reaching many bilateral agreements on their own. Mexico is  sponsoring bilateral free trade agreements with several Latin  American countries. It has already done this with Chile,  despite Mexico's participation in the famous NAFTA. It has just  signed an agreement with Venezuela and Colombia. The Group of  Three also entails free trade. Therefore, ideas about free  trade and Latin American integration are making way little by  little.    Of course, all this takes place amid a struggle between  blocs. Europe looks at the U.S. attempt to become the owner of  the Latin American markets with mistrust. Although it is true  that Mexico carries out most of its trade with the United  States, South Americans carry out approximately 20 percent or  less -- I cannot recall the exact figure right now -- of their  trade with the United States. South American countries carry  out important trade with the rest of the world and important  trade with Europe. Of course, that counters hegemonic U.S.  interests and its plans to seize control of the Latin American  markets.    This Miami summit could be very interesting if it addresses  all these things. That is why I said in my address that I hope  those issues are discussed and that if it only adopts measures  to dominate, seize control of the Latin American markets,  isolate Cuba, and eliminate Europe, Japan, and other areas from  trade with Latin America, then the time will come -- as Marti  said --to declare Latin America's second independence. The  truth is that all this entails a conflict. I do not think the  other blocs will fail to put up a fight even though GATT has  already been established. GATT still has many weak points. The  impositions by the great powers, mainly the United States, were  strong, particularly in the area of services and intellectual  copyright. All this must be analyzed better because agreements  were reached. Those agreements represent some advantages, but  those agreements were undoubtedly more advantages for the larger  blocs and the United States.    Obviously, it would like to monopolize trade in its  backyard,  namely Latin America. Latin America knows this. That is why we  welcome the fact that Mexico is sponsoring free trade  agreements. We welcome the fact that the Latin American  Integration Association, Mercosur [Common Market of the South],  the Central American Common Market, and the Andean Group are  advancing. Let us say they are subregional organizations that  seek subregional integration. It is good they prosper because  they, thus, become a form of resistance to the great effort to  swallow the Latin American and Caribbean markets and to impose  the U.S. conditions, which would give it the greater advantage.    [Correspondent] Commander, the Cartagena summit provided  tremendous support to subregional economic organizations as you  have just mentioned. Do you think this is a tendency that might  continue developing on the continent, and do you think this  tendency would form part of the Latin American economic  integration strategy? Another question I would like to ask: If  Latin America were to present a united front at the hemispheric  summit summoned by the United States, in your opinion, what  issues should it discuss?    [Castro] Well, your question is very long. First of all,  Latin America's interest and effort toward subregional economic  organizations has come about naturally, spontaneously, and  instinctively. Whether that becomes a strategy of the Latin  American summits is something else. This remains to be seen, but  I believe it is bound to be a more important player.    On the strategy that I think we should follow -- and I say  this as an absentee-Latin American to the Miami summit, of which  I spoke in my speech -- many of these issues would be a bit too  long to detail, but there are important aspects. We said that  resolution No. 301 should be rescinded and not used as a  negotiation weapon, as is the issue of intellectual property. We  must find a definite solution to the problem of the debt and the  fact that more aid is needed for development. We could add many  other things. The issue of unfair trade should be discussed in  more depth.    In just 12 years, Latin America has paid more than $700  billion, for two reasons only: First, in payment of the foreign  debt; and second, because of unfair trade during the past 12  years. It has lost more than $700 billion because of these two  things, in just 12 years. This is without including capital  drain. I believe these are important issues and ought to be  discussed at that summit. There are many other issues, but we  are speaking of economic factors. I do not want to speak long  because I already mentioned all these things. I put emphasis on  the issue of social development. I also mentioned the  seriousness, the graveness of the dismissal of human rights, as  important as the rights to education, health, the right to work,  the peoples' right to dignity and to their ethnic and cultural  identity. I spoke about the defense of sovereignty, the  principle of nonintervention in Latin American affairs,  renunciation of the pretexts that are increasingly used to  meddle in domestic affairs, such as the drug trafficking  problem. This should not serve to allow the United States to  limit the sovereignty of Latin American nations and turn their  armies into police forces.    In other words, there are economic aspects as well as  political aspects. I stressed that if it is true, as they said,  that they seek to establish more mature relations, and to close  their bases in Latin America, they should not forget to close  down the Guantanamo base, meet their accords, and withdraw their  forces from Panama and any other country. There are many  security, political, and economic problems to discuss at that  summit. If they want the opinions of the nongovernmental  organizations, they ought to ask the opinion of all -- the  indigenous peoples, women's groups, and unions, without  excluding any, as well as civilian organizations. There are  entire world of things to be discussed there. [passage  indistinct]    I advocated the Latin American discussion [30 second break  in  reception] that it not be allowed to become another catch phrase  of the day. I am glad that as a result of the summits we have  held independently, free from third party meddling and without  asking anyone's permission, they have been forced to summon the  Miami summit. They could have, of course, selected a different  city. Miami was chosen. They did not hide the fact that it is  part of a political ploy responding to U.S. domestic politics,  and once again, returning to their loathsome exclusion in the  end reflects -- I repeat -- political cowardice, lack of valor  to face the debate, lack of valor to face the truth. They do not  want to catch sight of anything like my uniform or guayaberas.    [Correspondent] All these U.S. political views, however, are  grounded in the basis of a so-called democracy. You also said at  the summit that much could be said about democracy, or even that  a summit on democracy could be organized. What is the true level  that democracy should have in Latin America?    [Castro] This is a difficult issue because we held some  closed door meetings. I, however, spoke about concepts of  democracy and said democracy cannot exist without equality,  without fraternity, and without social justice. I spoke of the  Athenian democracy, which had 30,000 free citizens and 70,000  slaves.    I mentioned some of these things. I had no choice but to  explain certain concepts, to ratify my principles and beliefs,  and to mention Carl Marx, his theories and hope for the  disappearance of the state. I mentioned that there are countries  that remind me of that Greek democracy. I am simply giving you a  glimpse. I do not want to be indiscreet. I simply want to say  that I spoke and spoke with firmness and conviction about some  of these ideas.    I also had to point out some things about Cuba, such as our  institutionalization; our Constitution, approved by over 90  percent of the citizens; and our electoral system. At times,  they talk as if Cuba is not a state of law, or has no  Constitution or elections. This lack of knowledge then becomes  an axiom. I was forced to speak very clearly about some of these  concepts, above all, in light of certain superficial, cliche  comments regarding these concepts. I, however, do not want to  say anything more or they will say I am a (?blabbermouth).    [Correspondent] Commander, again regarding the Miami summit:  Do you think that some of the presidents in attendance might  bring up the issue of the U.S. blockade against Cuba?    [Castro] Well, that was already brought up in Cartagena by  Brazilian President Itamar Franco. He rejected the blockade.  Now, we will wait and see how the summit goes. I can imagine. I  do not know how many minutes each speaker will have. It involves  many people, and if organizing these summits, which include  about 20 countries, is difficult, when you add all the others,  who knows how it is going to come out. I do not know how long  Clinton will speak or how long the others will speak, or the  agenda, or the pressures that the far right might try to exert  there. It is not bad, however, for the leaders of Latin America  and the Caribbean to get to know Miami.    There are many good people and many good Cubans in Miami.  There is a Puerto Rican population, and Mexicans, and  Colombians, and many others from many parts of Latin America.  They will also get to see, however, the mafia of fascist  gangsters of Cuban origin who own the city by virtue of their  financial might, terror, and the political lobbying conducted  through the media under their control. It is a good chance for  them to see this.    There are many other places. I believe it would have been  more politically correct for the United States, in wanting to  summon a summit, to choose a Latin American country. That would  have highly pleased the Latin American peoples. They, the owners  of the hemisphere, are seeking to turn Miami, however, into the  capital of the hemisphere.    [Correspondent] Commander, the convergence of regional  integration schemes as a way to attain the definitive  integration of Latin America was discussed at this summit. Of  the 21 Latin American countries, I believe that all except Cuba  are involved in some regional integration commerce scheme, such  as Mercosur, the Andean Pact, the EU [European Union] in the  case of Spain and Portugal, and the Central American Common  Market. How do you see....    [Castro, interrupting] We are tactically in the South. We  belong to the Latin American Economic System, SELA. Do not  forget.    [Correspondent] Yes, however, from the commercial point of  view, do you see in the near future a possibility....    [Castro, interrupting] We still do not have [words  indistinct]. We have to think about this. We have to discuss  this. The most appropriate time, however, for this is yet to  come. Logically, we have to attain these goals and objectives.  We have to become integrated. The important thing is for  integration to develop, to come to fruition. Without  integration, there will be nothing to integrate.    [Correspondent] Commander, how did the other heads of state  react to your second, historic address?    [Castro] What second, historic address?    [Correspondent] When you addressed them at the end of the  first day.    [Castro] Well, they listened with respect. I said several  truths. I said: This and this, and these points have not been  discussed. I, however, do not want to talk about the second  address which was longer. It lasted 25 minutes.    [Correspondent] That was the closed-door one.    [Castro] I had already hinted at some of the things  regarding  democracy that I had no choice but to discuss. I, however, do  not want to reveal anything else about the content of the talks  or I would be breaking my word. I do not know what the others  will do, or how much they will say, but I have to respect my  commitment to be as discreet as possible regarding the content  of the closed-door meeting.    [Correspondent] There were many presidents who said  farewell during this summit and others who participated for the  first time. What is your impression of these new voices in the  summit and bilateral meetings?    [Castro] In general, positive. In general, they are  intelligent people. Some are more outstanding than others. Some  have clearer views. Some speak in more specific terms. This is  so of the older ones as well as the new ones. In general, they  are intelligent people, capable people, who express themselves  well.    [Correspondent] What were the results of the bilateral  meetings?    [Castro] [Words indistinct] great kindness, a growing  kindness from everyone, with no exceptions. This is what I  noticed.    [Correspondent] Commander, what about the presence of U.S.  observers at this summit?    [Castro] I think that those who are trying to organize the  Miami summit were trying to learn how this summit was organized.  I do not know. This one was difficult to organize. They wanted  to include too many things in the agenda. The Colombian  organizers truly worked hard to organize the summit as well as  possible. From the beginning, we saw the agenda was overloaded,  intense. I was afraid there might be delays, and it happened. By  the end of the first day, we had not completed the discussions  on the first point. Later on, 10-minute coffee breaks lasted  half an hour or 35 minutes. There were dinners, and lunches in  various locations. We had to go by boat, travel, return, then  have recesses and fulfill many engagements.    Everything was scheduled precisely, but in general, in this  type of thing, schedules are not fully met. I would say it was  more disciplined than the nonaligned meetings and everyone was  usually present at the beginning of the meetings. These summits  are much smaller. A summit with 22 heads of state is not the  same as a meeting of 100. The Colombian Government made a great  effort, and selected a good site despite the fact that it did so  close to two other important events: elections next Sunday [19  June] and the World Soccer Cup. There are many soccer fans. At  least many people did get to focus on the summit while it was  being held, and act accordingly.    You had asked me about....    [Correspondent, interrupting] About the presence of U.S.  observers.    [Castro] That is what we were talking about. They came to  learn. That is what they say. I would truly like to see how they  organize the Miami summit. This makes me curious: how many  minutes each speaker will have, how long it will last, how it  will work. I do not know if they will put people out in space  for this and do spectacular things like they did during the  Olympics. We will see [snickers] how far the Americans' common  sense goes.    [Correspondent] The Caribbean States Association is going to  be created at the beginning of July. I would like to know, since  Cuba has been invited to join, what the range of possibilities  that this represents, will mean for Cuba?    [Castro] I think it is an important step forward, and  somehow, the Barbados meeting was part of the efforts aimed  toward the creation of this association and Cuba's  participation. As you know, the Yankees strongly oppose Cuba's  participation in any of these types of associations. We have to  wait to see how events develop, whether the pressures can be  overcome, and if Cuba gets to belong to this association.    [Correspondent] Commander, do you believe that in Latin  America, as well as in Ibero-America, there is currently a true  commitment to integration? And in this case: What roles would  Spain and Portugal play? Secondly, I would like to ask your  opinion on the final document and its frequently-referred to  content of neoliberalism and its praise for the Uruguay rounds  and GATT.    [Castro] A true, full commitment is still lacking. We could  say there is progress, which we could call significant, toward  developing that awareness. That awareness still has to develop  and to this end, the summits help. Spain and Portugal might play  a role in one way or another. They have advocated certain  interesting initiatives and have served as a bridge between  Latin America and Europe. As the threat of a war of large  economic blocs looms, the presence of Spain and Portugal is an  advantage, not in regard to integration because Spain and  Portugal cannot integrate into a joint Latin America, but they  can contribute to this integration. They can and are, as a  matter of fact, doing so. This is the way the summits were  conceived. On occasion, we have an opportunity to see the  advantage of their presence.    Was there a third question?    [Correspondent] Yes. The second question was about....    [Castro, interrupting] Well, I already answered the second  question about the role of Portugal. What was the other one?    [Correspondent] It was about your opinion on the final  document of the summit.    [Castro] One is never satisfied with the final documents of  these meetings. These are documents that have to be discussed  and negotiated extensively, keeping an eye on every comma and  word. The burden of neoliberalism is present in the reality of  Latin America. It is very strong and pervasive. Some have not  sympathized much with neoliberalism and certain personalities  and countries are beginning to show a not-so-blind faith in  neoliberalism. Some have turned it into a religion and others  are beginning to discover the other face of that religion. For  example, there is the case of Venezuela, which has huge problems  despite its wealth. They no longer speak in terms of  neoliberalism. There are other countries that do not express the  same enthusiasm. I do not want to mention them, so they cannot  be singled out. There is still, however, a strong neoliberal  following.    It would take awhile to explain. Many things have been  privatized, and much revenue as been accrued. It does not last,  however. There have been certain advantages, given the low  interest rates that have prevailed for a number of years. If the  interest rates, however, were to reach the 1985 level, when we  waged the fight against the foreign debt, a $487 billion debt  would be a catastrophe. There is much euphoria. Many are  euphoric following the implementation measures that have reduced  inflation and fiscal deficits and such, but at the cost of a  general shearing in terms of the budgets for social programs.    They are now beginning to realize that they might be digging  an abyss. Neoliberalism, the way it was advancing, was digging  an abyss. This is why, even the International Monetary Fund, the  World Bank, and the Inter-American Development Bank, are now  speaking of social costs. No one knows, however, from where or  when these monies will appear. What is true is that  circumstances have worsened and despite certain favorable  macroeconomic indexes, the per-capita income of Latin America --  not under a blockade, not under the harsh double blockade that  Cuba is experiencing, and not undergoing a special period -- is  the same as 16 years ago. The levels of education and health, in  general, are experiencing heavy setbacks, to the point that they  have realized this could result in far-reaching social  explosions. They greatly fear social explosions and are  beginning to talk about formulas to tackle what they call social  development; even the Yankees are becoming aware of this.  Neoliberalism is still strong. The neoliberal euphoria will last  for some time.    [Correspondent] Commander, your arrival at the summit made  us  remember Raul Ferrer's line: The Fatherland is a Mambi dressed  in guayabera. How did wearing a guayabera, after 37 years, make  you feel?    [Castro] I feel as good in a gala uniform as in an olive  green uniform, pajamas, shorts, or a guayabera. What happened,  as I explained today to our friends, is that we were all asked  to make an effort to show up in short sleeves and guayaberas  because of the heat. To tell you the truth, I did not have a  single guayabera. I had to borrow some and try them on to see if  they would fit, but none did. They made some guayaberas for me  in a few hours.    First, they had to find the fabric. We did not have any  fabric. They were trying to make a green guayabera, but we could  not find the fabric anywhere. They tried a strong blue hue, but  the only fabric that the people who do this for the Council of  State and institutions, that outfit people when they have to  fulfill a function, had available was this clear color. They are  good at this. They made a great effort, did not sleep. It was  chaos. I was scheduled to depart on Monday night, and by  midmorning, they tried a guayabera on me that they had finished  at who knows what hour. They were concerned about the length of  the sleeves, the fit of the shoulders, and whether it needed to  be a quarter-inch longer. The first one they made was like a  dressing gown. I fit in it twice. I said: I am really not this  fat. [laughter] They did not have my measurements or anything.  They fixed it. I am pleased. They came out quite well. They were  even concerned about what type of collar was in fashion. One of  the ones I borrowed was from (Chon) and had a longer collar.  [laughter] I am taller than (Chon) and it did not fit right.  Then, they said that the modern style was shorter. What do I  know about fashion? I do not want to be bothered by this.  Luckily, I did not have to have a suit made. I told them to find  a compromise. What I did was wear the white guayabera over the  cream shirt of my uniform. They had time to make at least four  pairs of pants. [laughter]    [Correspondent] It was a hit.    [Castro] This guayabera made history. Many praised it. Some  people were against it. A little girl asked me why I changed to  it, and I told her: No, I am still wearing my uniform, but  inside me. The boots were the same ones I use everyday. They are  really a bit old, but I am used to them. I wore the same boots  and the same uniform pants.    [Correspondent] Some said you were half civilian, half  military.    [Castro] Yesterday, I changed further so no one could say I  was wearing a uniform -- the same guayabera and pants, but I  wore navy blue and a darker blue guayabera, but the same boots.  I have only taken off my boots to sleep. I think this was the  right thing to do. Some have made all kinds of assumptions  because I was not wearing a uniform. I did it in response to my  host's request. I did not want to be the discordant note and  different from the rest.    [Correspondent] [Words indistinct] in guayabera or uniform?    [Castro] I still do not know. I still have things to do.  Perhaps my conscience will begin to bother me and I will put my  olive green uniform back on again. I could return in a  guayabera, but tomorrow I will not wear a guayabera. I cannot  say the final word, however. [laughter] I do not want to say  that I am never going to wear it. What do I know. Perhaps, there  is a reception I will have to wear it to. They are truly  comfortable and cool. Perhaps I will borrow one of Robertico's  [Robaina] uniforms. [laughter]    I have been comfortable. It is truly hot here. I think I am  going back to my old olive green uniform, however. It is an old  custom. That was the history of the guayabera; it was an  odyssey. I did not have anything to wear to comply with my hosts  except my pajamas. [laughter] My pajamas were the only outfit  that met their requirements. We solved the problem, however. But  I do not have a single suit. If one of these times they forced  me to wear a suit, I assure you, I am going to have to borrow  one.    [Correspondent] Commander, whether wearing a guayabera or an  olive green uniform, what are Cuba's dreams for the fifth summit?    [Castro] We have spoken of dreams so often. My guayabera and  my uniform, hwoever, are the Latin American of which Bolivar and  Marti dreamt. As I said today to our friends, we are not worthy  of speaking about Marti and Bolivar until we attain a united,  politically and economically, integrated Latin America. This is  my dream, and I believe, the dream of every progressive and  revolutionary man of Latin America. I can also speak of a dream  for a progressive and socialist Latin America. Yet, that is  looking far into the distance. If you said such a thing in a  summit, well, you can imagine. [laughter] Quite a brouhaha.</p>

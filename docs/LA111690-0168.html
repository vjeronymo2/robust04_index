			<p><P> November 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAGA OF ROCKY BALBOA, ROUND BY ROUND;  </P> <P> A MOVIEGOER'S GUIDE TO THE FOUR PREVIOUS SYLVESTER STALLONE 'ROCKY' MOVIES.  </P> <P> The thought of "Rocky V" may leave some moviegoers feeling pummeled, pounded  and downright punchy.  </P> <P> But if it's easy to take jabs at the Rocky series -- and the critics have dealt  plenty of kidney punches -- there is no denying the series' popularity.  Consider: the total worldwide purse tops $762 million.  </P> <P> Fans have made star/creator Sylvester Stallone a household name, and the films  have launched the careers of a trio of athletic actors who've portrayed his  opponents.  </P> <P> Still, all the ring activity of titles "I" through "IV" can leave a moviegoer  wobbly. What follows is a round-by-round guide to the Rocky films, to help  readers stay on their feet. Now . . . the bell . . .  </P> <P> ROUND 1: "Rocky" (1976).  </P> <P> The scenario: At 30, Rocky Balboa -- aka the Italian Stallion -- is a club  fighter who also works shaking down bad customers for Gazzo the loan shark (Joe  Spinell). Rocky lives in a row house apartment with his turtles, Cuff and Link,  and his fish, Moby Dick, and romances the shy and bespectacled pet shop  attendant, Adrian (Talia Shire), who's the sister of his obnoxious best friend  Paulie (Burt Young).  </P> <P> The challenge: Apollo Creed (former Oakland Raiders linebacker Carl Weathers)  -- a colorful, Muhammad Ali-like world heavyweight champ -- wants an underdog  opponent for his big Bicentennial fight of Jan. 1, 1976. Suddenly, Rocky faces  "the chance of a lifetime."  </P> <P> The training regimen: Under the guidance of feisty trainer/gym owner Mick  (Burgess Meredith), Rocky's up at 4 a.m., slurps down a cholesterol nightmare  of five raw eggs, dons grimy sweats and hits the streets for solitary roadwork  that climaxes with a run up the steps of Philly's Museum of Art -- to the  inspirational background song of "Gonna Fly Now" (aka the "Rocky" theme).  </P> <P> The big fight: It's the 190-pound Italian Stallion (64 fights, 44-20, with 38  by knockout) vs. the 210-pound showboating Master of Disaster, Creed (46-0). In  the bloody slugfest, Rocky lasts to the final bell. The split decision leaves  the title with the defending champ, who gasps, "Ain't gonna be no rematch!"  </P> <P> The stats: Filmed over 28 days for about $1 million, the sleeper of the year  grossed $117.2 million domestically, $45 million in foreign territories and won  three Oscars, including best picture. Nominated for both acting and writing,  Stallone followed in the weighty steps of Charlie Chaplin in 1940 and Orson  Welles in 1941.  </P> <P> As for a sequel: "I'll never do another 'Rocky.' It's a once-in-a-lifetime trip  . . .," says Stallone.  </P> <P> ROUND 2: "Rocky II" (1979).  </P> <P> The scenario: Opens with the last five minutes of the original Rocky. Then . .  . Rocky and Adrian marry, buy a house and become parents-to-be. Warned that he  could lose his right eye if he continues boxing, Rocky tries other jobs --  going from being a pitchman for commercials to menial labor.  </P> <P> The challenge: Creed -- who's irate over letters from fans who claim he didn't  really win his bout with Balboa -- goads Rocky into a rematch.  </P> <P> The training regimen: To protect his bad eye, Rocky works out right-handed. He  also chases chickens (for speed), and does the usual gym workouts and roadwork.  This time, as he sprints up the steps of the museum, he's joined by hundreds of  schoolchildren and a thunderous rendition of "Gonna Fly Now."  </P> <P> Preliminaries: Adrian slips into a coma after giving birth to their son, Rocky  Jr. When she finally awakens, she implores Rocky to win.  </P> <P> The big fight: It's the 202-pound Rocky vs. the 220-pound Creed on Thanksgiving  Day's Superfight II -- what one commentator dubs "World War III!" Knocked down  in round two, Rocky rebounds and the fight goes 15 bloody rounds (Rocky changes  to southpaw status for the 15th), climaxing with both battered warriors  falling. . . Finally, it's Rocky who rises, to take the title and declare to  the TV cameras and his recuperating wife, "Yo, Adrian, I did it!"  </P> <P> The stats: Budgeted at $7.6 million, "II" grossed $79.2 million domestically  and $45 million worldwide.  </P> <P> As for a sequel: Stallone -- who returned to "II" during career woes -- now  talks hopefully of a trilogy.  </P> <P> ROUND 3: "Rocky III" (1982).  </P> <P> The scenario: Opens with the final minutes of "II." Then . . . after defending  his title 10 times, Rocky reaps the rewards of celebrity. Meanwhile,  ominous-looking Clubber Lang (the then-unknown Mr. T, a former  bodyguard/bouncer) climbs the fight ranks. Though he eventually learns that  Mick has been protecting him by hand-picking opponents, Rock agrees to a match  with Lang, who KO's Rocky in round two. More bad news: Rocky's trainer dies.  </P> <P> The challenge: A rematch for Rocky and Lang, with Apollo Creed stepping in as  Rocky's trainer.  </P> <P> The training regimen: At the gritty L.A. gym where Creed got his start, Rocky  swims, does the gym routine and runs on the beach.  </P> <P> Preliminaries: Racked with self-doubt, Rocky has lost his nerve. Creed dares  him to get back "the eye of the tiger." (The name of the theme song, by  Survivor.) Adrian tells him . . . "Win!"  </P> <P> The big fight: It's the unrealistically small (191-pound) Italian Stallion vs.  the big and powerful (237-pound) Lang. Knocked down twice in round two, Rocky  eventually makes Lang see birdies in round 15. For this one, Rocky's got a new,  lean, mean physique, shown off in Creed's borrowed red, white and blue trunks.  (As the "Rockys" have progressed, the trunks have become smaller, showing off  more of the sculpted bods. Stallone/Rocky's face has also changed -- due to  real-life facial surgeries between "II" and "III.")  </P> <P> The stats: Budgeted at $16 million, "III" grossed $123 million domestically,  $75 million worldwide.  </P> <P> As for a sequel: "I love the character too much to do (another one), and have  people go away disappointed and say we bled it dry. So this is it," says  Stallone.  </P> <P> ROUND 4: "Rocky 4" (1985).  </P> <P> The scenario: Opens -- yawn -- with the final moments of "III." Then Apollo  Creed decides to return to the ring, with Rocky as his trainer, for an  exhibition match with awesome 6-foot-6 Soviet amateur world champ Ivan Drago  (Dolph Lundgren). When Drago fatally pulverizes Creed in a brutal match in Las  Vegas, Rocky sees red.  </P> <P> The challenge: It'll be Rocky vs. Drago -- aka the Siberian Express -- in a  non-title match held in the Soviet Union on Christmas Day. (The Soviets chose  the date.)  </P> <P> The training regimen: With Apollo's trainer, Duke (Tony Burton) stepping in as  his trainer, Rocky and Paulie head for an ice-covered lodge in the tundra,  where Rocky lifts logs, pulls peasants' carts from snow drifts and runs the  steppes (and Soviet mountains) as if they were the steps of the art museum.  </P> <P> Preliminaries: How can Rocky win against a virtual fighting machine? (Per  computer read-outs, Drago is shown punching 1,850 pounds of pressure  per-square-inch, compared to the average of 700.) As ever, Adrian balks at this  fight -- but then shows up in the Soviet Union to stand by her man.  </P> <P> The big fight: East meets West as the 261-pound Drago faces Rocky (we didn't  catch his weight, which was delivered in Russian), as an arena full of Soviets  and Politburo members -- including a Gorbachev look-alike -- look on. Turning  point: when Rocky cuts Drago, causing him to bleed. Soon, even members of the  Politburo are chanting "Rock-eee!" Yes, he wins -- topping his victory with a  speech about detente.  </P> <P> The stats: Budgeted at $34 million, "IV" grossed $128 million domestically,  $150 million worldwide.  </P> <P> As for a sequel: "This is it. What am I going to do, have Rocky fight E.T.?"  says Stallone after "Rocky IV" came out.  </P> <P> Time now for "V."  </P></p>

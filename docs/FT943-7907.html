			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Scottish graduates accrue least debt University students from Scotland who graduated this year were the most solvent, a survey by Barclays Bank has found, John Authers writes. The Scots owed only an average Pounds 900, partly because Scottish parents were the most likely to pay their formal contribution, with 77 per cent doing so in full, and because a higher proportion of Scottish students attended a local university and lived at home. The survey found students from the Midlands and north-west and north England accumulated the heaviest debts. Midlands students who graduated this year accumulated average debt of Pounds 2,371.</p>

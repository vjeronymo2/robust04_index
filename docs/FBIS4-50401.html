			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter He Jingsong (6320 0513 2646)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 5 Apr (XINHUA) -- China has achieved a  breakthrough in the automation of translations by intelligent  machines. The soundness of the cycle from basic research and  technical development to the market has enabled machine  translation, an achievement from research in high technology, to  be quickly turned into products and has enabled the language  information processing industry to take its initial shape in  China. The products are marketed at home and abroad, earning  profits of more than $5 million every year.    According to a briefing, the machine translation system is  one that uses a computer's understanding of the meaning of human  languages and words to complete the process of changing one  language into another for people. It is an integrated science  that involves various branches of learning, including  linguistics, computational linguistics, and computing  technology, and it has been listed at the top of the world's 10  greatest high technologies in the 21st century by an  authoritative international organization. Other countries have  invested huge capital in its development. The competition in  this field is very keen. Chen Zhaoxiong [7115 5128 7160], a  researcher at the Chinese Academy of Sciences [CAS], solved a  series of technical problems and initiated a system for the  theory on translation with the aid of an intelligent machine  through his explorations in theoretical research and in an  overall plan. As a result, he laid a foundation for converting  the achievement from research into this high technology into  products. In 1992, the CAS set up a special task force  concerning the project of the application of an intelligent  machine translation system. After two years' hard work, it  completed the transition from the system for the theory on  translation with the aid of an intelligent machine to an  application system. The project was appraised by the State  Science and Technology Commission as taking a leading place both  at home and abroad. The rate of accuracy of its translation  reached 83 percent, thus surpassing the maximum capability -- 70  percent -- of machine translation's accuracy which had long been  held by international machine translation circles. The project  won an award for scientific and technological advance, first  degree, from the CAS for its achievement.    To expedite the industrialization of the application system  of intelligent machine translation by converting it into  products as quickly as possible so as to gain investment returns  from the market for input into new research and development and  to enable a sound cycle to take shape, Chen Zhaoxiong set his  goal on a pocket electronic translation machine. Though such a  product had broad prospects for capturing the market both at  home and abroad, it encountered two long-standing technical  problems, namely, a low rate of translation accuracy and a long  period for development. It took two years to complete a system  for the crudest model of machine translation. Taking advantage  of its abundant technical forces, the CAS concentrated its  efforts on tackling the problems. In two months' time, it  completed the development of the system, solved the two major  technical problems of compressing the vast vocabulary into the  space restricted by a pocket machine and turning out a real-time  translation, and successfully developed the world's first  intelligent machine translation product -- the Kuaiyitong [fast  translation master] 863A pocket electronic translation machine  -- thereby attaining the goal of translating English into  Chinese through a machine. Such a new product is capable of  displaying on the screen a Chinese sentence corresponding to its  English sentence within a few seconds after the latter is  entered onto the keyboard, complete with simultaneous  pronunciations in English and Mandarin. Shortly after 10,000  Kuaiyitong units were marketed in Hong Kong, they were all sold.  At present, the product enjoys sales of 1,000 units a day on  the international market. The big economic returns produced  from quickly turning an achievement from high technology theory  into products attracted businessmen from both at home and  abroad; one after another, they requested a joint venture and  cooperation. The Institute of Computing Technology of the CAS  set up the Kezhi Company in a timely manner to conduct  joint-venture development with foreign businessmen. It earned  $4.44 million for the state from the technical licensing of the  pocket intelligent English-Chinese translation system alone. To  date, it is the project that has earned the highest amount of  foreign exchange for China from the transfer of rights to use a  type of software. So far, the Kezhi Company has also developed  an intelligent Chinese- English machine translation system. It  has also successively started the research and development of  Russian-Chinese and German-Chinese machine translation systems,  a combination system for phonetic sound identification, and  other projects, and it has made very good progress.</p>

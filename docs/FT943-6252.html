			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / Invasion of Haiti edges a step closer US and Caribbean governments yesterday moved closer to launching a multinational invasion force against Haiti, as the United Nations warned that diplomatic efforts to oust the military leadership had failed. Momentum for a military coalition grew when Jamaica, Barbados, Belize and Trinidad-Tobago indicated they would commit a small number of troops to a Haiti force. The Bahamas, Guyana and Antigua are also considering joining. The Caribbean countries' decision is a victory for the US, which wants at least symbolic contingents from allies to move in behind an initial wave of US troops. The four nations will supply a total of about 266 soldiers as part of a force estimated by US officials at about 10,000. They announced their backing at a meeting of the Caribbean Community (Caricom) in Kingston, Jamaica, attended by Mr Strobe Talbott, US deputy secretary of state, and Mr John Deutch, deputy defence secretary. 'The time for action has arrived,' Mr Deutch said. 'There can be no doubt in anybody's mind that the multinational force is going to Haiti.' Another senior US official said that the US was not yet at the point of invasion 'but we are moving briskly in that direction. . . We are very close to exhausting all peaceful means'. The US won a UN mandate last month to use 'all necessary means' to oust the military elite who deposed President Jean-Bertrand Aristide three years ago. In New York, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, said the last peaceful efforts to persuade Haiti's rulers to step down had failed as 'the military people in Haiti refused to talk with my special representative'. He said there were no plans to continue the diplomatic mission unless there was a new mandate from the Security Council. Mr Boutros Ghali implied the next step would be up to the US. The Security Council or the group of states who 'sought the mandate. . . will have to take their own decision', he said. The stepping up of US rhetoric follows criticism that the Haiti issue had been put on the back burner as the Cuban refugee crisis gripped the attention of the Clinton administration. But the US on Monday reiterated the 'determination of the international community to take all the necessary means to bring the early restoration of democracy'. Mr Deutch said training for the multinational force was expected to begin immediately at a military base in Puerto Rico.</p>

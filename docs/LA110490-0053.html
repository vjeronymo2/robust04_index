			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PAPERBACKS  </P> <P> THE CIVIL WAR NOTEBOOK OF DANIEL CHISHOLM, edited by W. Springer Menge and J.  August Shimrak (Ballantine: $9.95). The recent PBS series has sparked a renewed  interest in the Civil War, and these letters and diary entries by two soldiers  in the Army of the Potomac reveal the wretched daily grind beneath the  strategic maneuvers.  </P> <P> Like soldiers in any war, Daniel Chisholm and Samuel Clear were preoccupied  with the tedious problems of daily survival: Mud, disease, weather, appalling  food and the horrors of battle outweighed any ideological considerations. ("The  rain is falling nearly all the time, our camp is very muddy . . . Nothing  worthy of note today," reads Clear's entry for Jan. 9, 1865.) This grimly real  view from the trenches balances out the dry-cleaned glamour of staged battle  re-creations and popular novels.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In a message published on 2 January, the National  Congress of Democratic Movements [CONACOM] pointed out that  Haiti needs a truce. CONACOM says it has requested from the  Haitian Armed Forces [FADH] the application of concrete measures  to guarantee the safety of all the country's sons regardless of  political credo. CONACOM's message further states that it is  more than time to put an end to the maneuvers of politicians who  use FADH members to arbitrarily attack their political  adversaries. The party says it has asked President Jean-Bertrand  Aristide to see to it that the gathering initiatives that he is  organizing abroad during this month of January contribute to  pave the way for a true national conference. This national  conference is to be held in Haiti and supported by the  international community as soon as possible, with the  participation of the political and social sectors that agree to  work for the establishment of at least an internal democratic  state of law, and for the short-term application of the  Governors Island Agreement.</p>

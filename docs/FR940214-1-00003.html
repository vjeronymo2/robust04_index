The proposal would suspend a portion of the supply plant shipping requirement and the touch-base requirement during the months of February through August of each year. The action was requested by Kraft General Foods (Kraft), which contends the suspension is necessary to prevent the uneconomical and inefficient movement of milk and to ensure that producers historically associated with the market will continue to have their milk pooled under Order 106. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments are due no later than February 22, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments (two copies) should be filed with the USDA/AMS/Dairy Division, Order Formulation Branch, room 2968, South Building, P.O.

Box 96456, Washington, DC 20090&hyph;6456, (202) 690&hyph;1932. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612) requires the Agency to examine the impact of a proposed rule on small entities. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has certified that this proposed action would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Such action would lessen the regulatory impact of the order on certain milk handlers and would tend to ensure that dairy farmers would continue to have their milk priced under the order and thereby receive the benefits that accrue from such pricing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposed suspension has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This action is not intended to have a retroactive effect. If adopted, this proposed action will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with the rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 8c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provisions of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and request a modification of the order or to be exempted from the order. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After a hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has its principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, suspension of the following provisions of the order regulating the handling of milk in the Southwest Plains marketing area is being considered for the months of February through August of 1994 through 1996, effective upon publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In &sect;1106.6, the words ``during the month''. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In &sect;1106.7(b)(1), beginning with the words ``of February through August'' and continuing to the end of the paragraph. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In &sect;1106.13, paragraph (d)(1) in its entirety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All persons who wish to send written data, views or arguments about the proposed suspension should send two copies of them to the USDA/AMS/Dairy Division, Order Formulation Branch, room 2968, South Building, P.O. Box 96456, Washington, DC 20090&hyph;6456, by the 7th day after publication of this notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The period for filing comments is limited to 7 days because a longer period would not provide the time needed to complete the required procedures before the requested suspension is to be effective. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The comments that are sent will be made available for public inspection in the Dairy Division during normal business hours (7 CFR 1.27(b)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Statement of Consideration <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed suspension would suspend the requirement that producers ``touch-base'' at a pool plant with at least one day's production during the month before their milk is eligible for diversion to a nonpool plant. By suspending the touch-base provision, producer milk would not be required to be delivered to pool plants before going to unregulated manufacturing plants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, the proposed suspension would allow a supply plant that has been associated with the Southwest Plains order during the months of September through January of each year to qualify as a pool plant without shipping any milk to a pool distributing plant during the following months of February through August. Without the suspension, a supply plant would be required to ship 20 percent of its producer receipts to pool distributing plants to qualify as a pool plant during each of the months of February through August. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> According to Kraft's letter requesting the suspension, supplemental milk supplies will not be needed to meet the fluid needs of distributing plants. Kraft anticipates that there will be an adequate supply of direct-ship producer milk located in the general area of distributing plants available to meet the Class I needs of the market. Consequently, it states, there is no need to require producers located some distance from pool distributing plants to touch-base when their milk can more economically be diverted directly to manufacturing plants in the production area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 1106 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Milk marketing orders. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The authority citation for 7 CFR part 1106 continues to read as follows: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Authority: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  Secs. 1&hyph;19, 48 Stat. 31, as amended; 7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: February 7, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Lon Hatamiya, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Administrator. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;3327 Filed 2&hyph;11&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 3410&hyph;02&hyph;P  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

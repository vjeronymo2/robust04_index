			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / Creditors ready to demand aid CREDITORS of BCCI are likely to seek international government help to make good their losses if the judgment to be given in the High Court today goes against them. The plan is being developed alongside a more aggressive stance being taken by creditors over the past few days. They have been accused in the court hearing of making their criticisms of the settlement 'too little, too late'. The eight-strong creditors' committee argues that the Pounds 930m compensation offer negotiated by Touche Ross, BCCI's liquidators, with the government of Abu Dhabi, the majority shareholder, is insufficient.</p>

			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / UK Company News: CUC Intl acquires Leaguestar for Dollars 70m LEAGUESTAR, the private company which runs the Worldex timeshare exchange business and a chain of US travel agents, is being bought for Dollars 70m (Pounds 45.5m) by CUC International, the US computer merchandising group. The price compares with a value for the company of about Pounds 12m in 1988. Leaguestar, a venture capital backed business, had originally aimed at a flotation but found that a higher price could be obtained through a trade sale. It was formed in 1988 when TTI, an Isle of Man trustee company which acted for timeshare companies, was merged with Worldex, with Pounds 6m of backing from institutions led by Lloyds Development Capital. As part of the sale to CUC, TTI has been bought by its management for about Pounds 250,000. Mr James Edmonds and Mr Simon Bowen, who set up Leaguestar, have sold their stakes and left the group. Leaguestar's profits have grown rapidly. In 1991 it made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 5.2m on turnover of Pounds 25.8m. Profits in 1990 were Pounds 2.8m and in 1989 Pounds 1.2m. Lloyds Development Capital said it originally invested Pounds 1.5m but had been repaid just over Pounds 1m, leaving it with an equity stake at a cost of Pounds 450,000. Under the deal it received Pounds 3.45m for the shares.</p>

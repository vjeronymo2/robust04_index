			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARCHITECTURE: ENVIRONMENT BY DESIGN;  </P> <P> HUSBAND-WIFE TEAM CREATES TOTAL PICTURE INSIDE AND OUT  </P> <P> Environment, defined, in its modern sense, by the Oxford English Dictionary as  "the sum total of influences which modify and determine the development of life  or character," is a word that has come to cast a lengthening shadow over our  minds.  </P> <P> In response to this concern, environmental design has taken on an increasing  significance for architects, landscape architects and graphic artists. Its  impact blurs the usual boundaries between design disciplines, dissolving the  barriers between the professionals who devise the interiors and exteriors of  buildings.  </P> <P> Graphic designers, particularly, have led the way in this fertile fusion of  experts. They have broken out of their traditional box as the contrivers of  corporate brochures and the designers of signs that decorate architecture, to  deal with the spaces inside and between buildings, and the total look of the  man-made environment.  </P> <P> The husband-and-wife team of Deborah Sussman and Paul Prejza, practicing as  Sussman/Prejza &amp; Co. Inc. in Culver City, is widely recognized as a pioneer  of environmental design in the United States. Expanding from a basis of  conventional graphics, Sussman/Prejza now conjures up sophisticated  environmental scenarios that encompass everything from the gravity of  near-architecture to the lighthearted creation of miniature worlds for toy  fairs.  </P> <P> "Increasingly, architects and developers call upon us to help design  environments that harmonize the look and feel of everything from the color of a  wall to the configuration of the spaces surrounding and linking buildings with  their neighbors," Prejza said. "What we have done in essence is expand our  expertise in creating coherent images from a small scale to a larger one."  </P> <P> Sussman/Prejza earned a national reputation for their designs for the 1984  Summer Olympics, in collaboration with architects of the Jerde Partnership.  Their Olympic pastiche of boulevard banners, lighthearted stars fallen from  heaven and the jaunty pavilions they erected up all over the city drew wide  praise for creating an unifying identity for the farflung Los Angeles Games.  </P> <P> Architect Barton Myers, who has collaborated with Sussman/Prejza on many  projects over the past decade, praises the designers for their "amazing skill  in moving out into the wider environment, beyond the mere making of signs,  logos and patterns that preoccupy most graphic artists." Sussman/Prejza has  been an integral element in Myer's design team, from his proposal for the Grand  Avenue development on Bunker Hill in the late 1970s to his recently won  commission for the American Pavilion at the 1992 Seville World's Fair.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Taken the Lead'  </P> <P> "Paul and Deborah have taken the lead in breaking out of the usual restricted  role of graphic designers," Myers said. "They have taken under their wing all  the areas between and within buildings that often fell through the cracks  dividing architecture, landscape and urban design in conventional practice."  </P> <P> A major environmental design project currently on Sussman/Prejza's boards is  the Citadel, a commercial development planned around the landmark Samson Tyre  and Rubber Co. building in the City of Commerce, east of downtown. Designed in  1929 by Morgan, Walls and Clements, the now-abandoned Samson factory features a  crenelated wall nearly one-third of a mile long contrived to resemble a Cecil  B. De Mille version of an Assyrian palace decorated with heraldic griffins and  bas-reliefs of Babylonian princes.  </P> <P> Behind the preserved facade of the old factory Sussman/Prejza are designing a  140,000-square-foot factory retail outlet center and food fair to serve a  nearby office park and hotel. After the architects developed the Citadel's  schematic master plan and the landscape architects devised the basic layout of  the open spaces surrounding the buildings, Sussman/Prejza fleshed out the  project with a range of designs from tented stalls and glass pavilions to  paving patterns and the internal architecture of the muscular columns and  trusses of the old factory. With colorful booths, signs and streamers, they  transformed it into a fanciful cathedral of consumption.  </P> <P> Sussman/Prejza have suggested that the Citadel development adopt the winged  griffin as its integrating image. They would like to see a huge golden griffin  soaring above the Assyrian palace as a beacon to attract motorists on the  neighboring freeway.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Symbolic Shorthand'  </P> <P> "We always seek out the one striking visual metaphor that can become the  symbolic shorthand for the whole design," Sussman explained. "Everything else,  down to the tiniest detail, is keyed to that prime image or plays against it as  a counterpoint. This device helps integrate the entire environmental scenario  and gives it a sense of overall cohesion we think is vital to its humanity."  </P> <P> In a recently opened Minneapolis shopping mall, Sussman's team came up with the  idea of using the loon, the Minnesota state bird, as a symbol. The creature's  staring eyes and vivid profile are repeated in many of the mall's signs and  packaging, culminating in a giant gilded loon suspended over the mall's central  stair.  </P> <P> Prejza points to an increasing sophistication among architects and developers  about the need for environmental design. The total look of a development has  become a huge plus in an increasingly competitive commercial market. Kevin  Staley, a partner in Trammell Crow Co., the Citadel developers, insisted on  Sussman/Prejza's participation in the project "because of their nationally  recognized leadership in environmental design, which has become such a vital  ingredient in the success of major commercial projects."  </P> <P> "Clients want to make a splash," Prejza said, "and they know we can give it to  them. They know their design image is a vital ingredient in their corporate or  market message to a public that has become sensitized to its man-made  surroundings. They know design counts, at every level."  </P> <P> To respond to the wide range of projects they are offered, Sussman/Prejza has  structured its 40-person office into four fluid categories, each under the  supervision of a senior associate. Exhibits, such as the annual Hasbro Toy  Fair, are in the charge of Mark Nelsen. Scott Cuyler leads the section dealing  with industrial design that involves free-standing objects, such as the road  signs decorated with stylized Mickey Mouse ears for the planned Eurodisney  complex outside Paris. Debra Valencia supervises the design of traditional  graphics, including logos, brochures, posters etc. Fernando Vasquez oversees  the design of architectural interiors and retail projects such as the Gaviidae  and The Citadel.  </P> <P> Sussman and Prejza's unusual combination of training and talent explains the  firm's unique expertise in environmental design. Educated as a graphic designer  at Chicago's Institute of Design, Sussman honed her skills in the L.A. office  of Charles and Ray Eames in the 1950s. "The Eameses were the world's first  environmental designers, before the term was even invented," she said. "They  crossed boundaries at will, designing everything, from children's games to  houses, without changing hats. It was a wonderful apprenticeship for me."  </P> <P> Trained as an architectural historian at Pennsylvania State University, Prejza  was employed in the L.A. City Planning Department when he met his wife in 1967.  Six years later they decided to set up practice together. Prejza's cool  competence acts as a foil to his wife's exuberant imagination, and his grasp of  the wider issues of urban design complements her passion for detail.  </P> <P> Success makes Sussman feel that the sky's the limit. "My ambition is to design  an airline," she said, "from the tickets through the flight attendants'  uniforms to the arrangement of the seating and the painting of the planes. Air  travel is one environment most of us have to suffer, and it has become  increasingly stressful and ugly. Imagine what it would be like to fly with an  airline in which everything you saw and experienced pleased the eye and soothed  the nerves."  </P></p>

			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Westland ahead 22% to Pounds 30.5m Westland, the UK's only helicopter manufacturer, yesterday reported a better than expected 22 per cent rise in pre-tax profits, as strong productivity improvements offset difficult conditions in defence and civil markets. Pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 30.5m (Pounds 24.9m) on a 6 per cent increase in sales to Pounds 448m (Pounds 422.1m) for the year to October 1. New orders showed a sharp decline to Pounds 465m compared with Pounds 1.18m last time when the company won an order worth Pounds 800m for 44 of its new Merlin EH101 helicopters from the Royal Navy. Mr Alan Jones, chief executive, said notwithstanding the lower order intake, the company had a 'good year'. 'Our new style of management has become deeply engrained inside the organ-isation and has enabled us to improve productivity and reduce costs,' said Mr Jones, who is taking over as executive chairman when Sir Leslie Fletcher, the 71-year-old chairman, retires in February. Productivity improvements and a sharp drive to reduce stocks helped to cut net debt from Pounds 30m to Pounds 6m, leaving gearing at 3.1 per cent (16.4 per cent). However, the company expects to see a temporary rise in borrowings over the next few years to finance investments in the production launch of the EH101, which it is developing jointly with Agusta of Italy. Mr Jones said Westland would be spending some Pounds 40m-Pounds 50m on the EH101 programme, of which Pounds 8m had already been spent last year. After the disappointment of the new Canadian government's recent decision to cancel an order for 43 EH101s, Westland is now banking on a Royal Air Force order for about 25 EH101s as well as orders for a civil version of the large helicopter from North Sea oil offshore operators. Westland has also continued efforts to diversify in the civil aerospace sector. Mr Jones said the company was well positioned to take advantage of a recovery in the civil market. Earnings per share improved to 13.7p (12.1p); the final dividend is 3.25p, raising the total for the year to 4.5p (4.25p). COMMENT The results, at the top end of expectations, reflected a good performance in a difficult year for the defence and aerospace industry and underlines the steady progress the company has made to improve productivity and margins over the past five years. The City expects this will help the company maintain profit improvement next year, even though there are still few signs of recovery in the civil aerospace market and the defence business is still contracting. Profits are forecast to rise to about Pounds 35m-Pounds 36m in the current year. Against the continuing uncertainties of the defence and aerospace markets, analysts are focusing on potential rather than on the short term multiple.</p>

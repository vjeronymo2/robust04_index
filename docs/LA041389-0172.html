			<p><P> April 13, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TRANS COM TO BE SOLD TO SONY  </P> <P> Trans Com Systems, an Irvine manufacturer of stereo and movie systems for  airplanes, will be sold to Sony Corp. for more than $50 million.  </P> <P> Selling was Sundstrand Corp., a Rockford, Ill., defense contractor hit recently  with $198.6 million in fines and payments to settle a federal investigation of  defense contract fraud.  </P> <P> There was speculation Sundstrand may have agreed to sell Trans Com to raise  cash, but a spokesman said that is not the case. Instead, he said, Sundstrand  sold the unit because it could no longer compete effectively.  </P> <P> Trans Com has encountered a much more difficult market since the Japanese  company Matsushita decided to sell its own stereo and movie equipment directly  to airlines, bypassing a Trans Com competitor that had packaged Matsushita's  systems for sale.  </P> <P> By selling directly to the airlines, Matsushita was able to undersell Trans Com  and other companies in the market.  </P> <P> So Sundstrand decided to sell, since its "philosophy is to be the market leader  in almost every business we're in," the spokesman said.  </P> <P> Sony should do better with the unit since it already supplies Trans Com with  70% of its video and audio components. All the major airlines are customers,  said the Sundstrand spokesman, and Trans Com had sales of $40 million last  year. The company employs 260.  </P> <P> The sale must be approved by both companies' boards. MICHAEL FLAGG  </P></p>

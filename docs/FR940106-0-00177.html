			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> (2) The claimant's answers to questions on mail claim(s) indicate that he may be unable to work or that there may be undue restrictions on his availability for work or that his search for work may be inadequate or that he may be disqualified;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The claimant's answers to questions on mail claims create uncertainty about his credibility or indicate a lack of understanding of the applicable requirements; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The claimant's record shows that he has previously filed a fraudulent claim.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In such circumstances, the claimant is required to continue to file claims in person each week (or biweekly) until the State agency determines that filing claims in person is no longer required for the resolution of such questions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. A claimant must be permitted to file a claim by mail in any of the following circumstances:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. He is located in an area requiring the expenditure of an unreasonable amount of time or money in traveling to the nearest facility established by the State agency for filing claims in person;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Conditions make it impracticable for the agency to take claims in person;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. He has returned to full-time work on or before the scheduled date for his filing a claim, unless the agency makes provision for in-person filing at a time and place that does not interfere with his employment;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d. The agency finds that he has good cause for failing to file a claim in person.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. A claimant who has been receiving benefits for partial unemployment may continue to file claims as if he were a partially unemployed worker for the first four consecutive weeks of total or part-total unemployment immediately following his period of partial unemployment so long as he remains attached to his regular employer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B. Claim filing_partial unemployment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Each individual claiming unemployment compensation for a week (or other claim period) during which, because of lack of work, he is working less than his normal customary full-time hours for his regular employer and is earning less than the earnings limit provided in the State law, shall not be required to file a claim for such week or other claim period earlier than 2 weeks from the date that wages are paid for such claim period or, if a low earnings report is required by the State law, from the date the employer furnished such report to the individual. State agencies may permit claims for partial unemployment to be filed either in person or by mail, except that in the circumstances set forth in section A 3, filing by mail must be permitted, and in the circumstances set forth in section A 2 b, filing in person may be required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> 5002&blank; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=3 --> Requirement for Job Finding, Placement, and Other Employment Services Designed to Satisfy Secretary's Interpretation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> A. Claims personnel are required to assure that each claimant is doing what a reasonable individual in his circumstances would do to obtain suitable work.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B. In the discretion of the State agency:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The claims personnel are required to give each claimant such necessary and appropriate assistance as they reasonably can in finding suitable work and at their discretion determine when more complete placement and employment services are necessary and appropriate for a claimant; and if they determine more complete services are necessary and appropriate, the claims personnel are to refer him to employment service personnel in the public employment office in which he has been filing claim(s), or, if he has been filing in a claims office, in the public employment office most accessible to him; or <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. All placement and employment services are required to be afforded to each claimant by employment service personnel in the public employment office most accessible to him in which case the claims personnel in the office in which the claimant files his claim are to refer him to the employment service personnel when placement or other employment services are necessary and appropriate for him.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C. The personnel to whom the State agency assigns the responsibilities outlined in paragraph B above are required to give claimants such job-finding assistance, placement, and other employment services as are necessary and appropriate to facilitate their return to suitable work as soon as possible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In some circumstances, no such services or only limited services may be required. For example, if a claimant is on a short-term temporary layoff with a fixed return date, the only service necessary and appropriate to be given to him during the period of the layoff is a referral to suitable temporary work if such work is being performed in the labor market area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Similarly, claimants whose unemployment is caused by a labor dispute presumably will return to work with their employer as soon as the labor dispute is settled. They generally do not need services, nor do individuals in occupations where placement customarily is made by other nonfee charging placement facilities such as unions and professional associations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Claimants who fall within the classes which ordinarily would require limited services or no services shall, if they request placement and employment services, be afforded such services as are necessary and appropriate for them to obtain suitable work or to achieve their reasonable employment goals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On the other hand, a claimant who is permanently separated from his job is likely to require some services. He may need only some direction in how to get a job; he may need placement services if he is in an occupation for which there is some demand in the labor market area; if his occupation is outdated, he may require counseling and referral to a suitable training course. The extent and character of the services to be given any particular claimant may change with the length of his unemployment and depend not only on his own circumstances and conditions, but also on the condition of the labor market in the area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> D. Claimants are required to report to employment service personnel, as directed, but such personnel and the claims personnel required to so arrange and coordinate the contacts required of a claimant as not to place an unreasonable burden on him or unreasonably limit his opportunity to establish his rights to compensation. As a general rule, a claimant is not required to contact in person claims personnel or employment service personnel more frequently than once a week, unless he is directed to report more frequently for a specific service such as referral to a job or a training course or counseling which cannot be completed in one visit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> E. Employment service personnel are required to report promptly to claims personnel in the office in which the claimant files his claim(s): (1) his failure to apply for or accept work to which he was referred by such personnel or when known, by any other nonfee-charging placement facility such as a union or a professional association; and (2) any information which becomes available to it that may have a bearing on the claimant's ability to work or availability for work, or on the suitability of work to which he was referred or which was offered to him.  <!-- PJG 0101 clearpage -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

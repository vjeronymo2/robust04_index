The way in which the thieves operated and  the nature of the objects stolen made the UDMR deputy draw the  conclusion that it was "a perfectly organized action of  intimidation." From among the valuable things that would have  sold well, the thieves selected only a few pieces of jewelry,  although they could have also stolen a fur coat, a large golden  watch, a number of other valuable things, as well as brand new  audio and video equipment. However, they did bother to steal a  great number of documents and audio and video tapes belonging to  Mr. Konya-Hamar, the contents of which was related to events in  his political and parliamentary life. For instance, they stole  the parliamentary diary he wrote over 1992-93, as well as  recordings of a number of discussions held by Mr. Konya Hamar  with various personalities, among whom figure Vaclav Havel and  [former Romanian minister for culture and opposition figure]  Andrei Plesu.    The secretary of the chamber of deputies has been receiving  threatening phone calls recently, and although he notified the  telephone company requesting that they monitor the incoming  calls, he has not received any concrete answers.    As the violation of the apartment has been reported to the  police, the latter -- considering that Konya-Hamar is a member  of parliament -- should notify the State Attorney's Office, the  Ministry of Interior, and the Chamber of Deputies. However, no  official report on the incident was sent to Chamber of Deputies  Speaker Adrian Nastase by Monday [31 January] at 1600.</p>

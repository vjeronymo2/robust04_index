			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / International Company News: Better tanker market sparks Bergesen recovery BETTER tanker market conditions, a stronger US dollar and gains on share sales helped Bergesen, the Norwegian shipping group, bounce back to profit for the first eight months of 1993. The group offset heavy foreign exchange losses and a weak performance from its liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) activities to record a pre-tax profit NKr171m (Dollars 24.14m). That compares with a NKr32m deficit for the same period in 1992. Operating revenues rose to NKr1.97bn from NKr1.64bn, with the dollar up 13 per cent against the krone since last year and average daily tanker rates up 20 per cent at Dollars 18,000. Operating profits climbed to NKr195m from NKr61m. The tanker division halved its operating loss but LPG profits were lower. The group does not expect significantly improved rates in any of its market segments in the last four months of the year.</p>

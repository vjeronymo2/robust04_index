			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> iv. The planned control program is designed to allow cost effective expansion or cost effective retrofitting if additional controls are subsequently determined to be necessary to meet WQS or designated uses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Cost/Performance Considerations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The permittee should develop appropriate cost/performance curves to demonstrate the relationships among a comprehensive set of reasonable control alternatives that correspond to the different ranges specified in Section II.C.4. This should include an analysis to determine where the increment of pollution reduction achieved in the receiving water diminishes compared to the increased costs. This analysis, often known as knee of the curve, should be among the considerations used to help guide selection of controls. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Operational Plan <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After agreement between the permittee and NPDES authority on the necessary CSO controls to be implemented under the long-term CSO control plan, the permittee should revise the operation and maintenance program developed as part of the nine minimum controls to include the agreed-upon long-term CSO controls. The revised operation and maintenance program should maximize the removal of pollutants during and after each precipitation event using all available facilities within the collection and treatment system. For any flows in excess of the criteria specified at II.C.4.a.i., ii. or iii and not receiving the treatment specified in II.C.4.a, the operational plan should ensure that such flows receive treatment to the greatest extent practicable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 7. Maximizing Treatment at the Existing POTW Treatment Plant <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In some communities, POTW treatment plants may have primary treatment capacity in excess of their secondary treatment capacity. One effective strategy to abate pollution resulting from CSOs is to maximize the delivery of flows during wet weather to the POTW treatment plant for treatment. Delivering these flows can have two significant water quality benefits: First, increased flows during wet weather to the POTW treatment plant may enable the permittee to eliminate or minimize overflows to sensitive areas; second, this would maximize the use of available POTW facilities for wet weather flows and would ensure that combined sewer flows receive at least primary treatment prior to discharge. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Estonian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by President Lennart Meri to the Riigikogu -- live] </F>   [Excerpts] [Meri] [passage omitted] Instead of drawing  objective conclusions from the changing balance of power in both  the world and in Estonia, and expanding the governmental basis  resolutely -- if necessary at the cost of his own resignation --  the prime minister has aimed at preserving his power and making  a dangerous compromise.    The proposed government reshuffle will retain current  governmental practices and the current decision-making  mechanism, which works behind closed doors in a room next door  rather than around the governmental table. The outcome is a  more administrative government with a more administrative prime  minister. Concentrating power instead of delegating it cannot  be served up as a parliamentary practice, however attractively  arranged. The reason why I consider it necessary to talk to  you, esteemed people's deputies, with worry and openness, stems  from an issue that a year or two ago was not yet topical. It is  topical today and directly concerns Estonian national security.  I say this as the top commander of Estonian state defense  according to Section 16, Article 78 of the Constitution.  [passage omitted]    Having said what I had to say and hoping that at critical  moments the country's interests would come higher than party  interests, I will now, before your very eyes, sign the  resolution, which at the present moment in history must unite  us, lift us above our differences of opinion, and assist the  republican government in keeping the Estonian country's  interests apart from party interests.</p>

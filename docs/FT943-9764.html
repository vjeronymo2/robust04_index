			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / International Company News: Charges depress Ciga group The hotels division of Ciga of Italy continued to improve its operating result in the first seven months of this year. But the luxury hotels group, which is now in effect controlled by ITT Sheraton, the US conglomerate, will still be forced to announce a loss for the first half because of heavy financial charges. Ciga yesterday published figures which show that occupancy rates at its 34 hotels increased by 9.2 percentage points in the first seven months of this year, to 59.4 per cent. The hotels' turnover increased by 11.7 per cent to L295bn (Dollars 187m), compared with L264bn in the first equivalent period last year. Under the control of Fimpar, the holding company of the Aga Khan, Ciga's debts and losses mounted, and earlier this year first Forte, the UK hotels group, and then ITT Sheraton launched bids for control. ITT's initial strategy failed when a deliberately overpriced rights issue - supposed to deliver Ciga to the US group - was fully subscribed, raising more than L1bn to help reduce the Italian company's borrowings. But ITT has still managed to build a stake in Ciga of more than 20 per cent, and three of the seven-strong board are ITT appointees. Italy's stock market watchdog decided at the end of last month that ITT should mount a formal bid for further Ciga shares as it had gained control of the company, but the authority has yet to specify the terms or scope of such an offer. Banca Commerciale Italiana, the Italian bank privatised earlier this year, is to launch its L2,362bn discounted issue of shares and warrants on August 18, and the offer will close on September 16. The new shares will be priced at L3,000 and offered on the basis of one new share for every two held, the bank said.</p>

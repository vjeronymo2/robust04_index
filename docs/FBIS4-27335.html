			<p>BFN     [Text] Keigo Ouchi, chairman of the Democratic Socialist  Party [DSP], delivered a speech in Morioka City on 29 May, in  which he commented on the "Kaishin" parliamentary group in the  House of Representatives, the formation of which triggered the  Social Democratic Party of Japan's secession from the coalition  government. He said, "While this group is being criticized, from  a long-term point of view, it will prove to be useful (for the  realignment of the political world)." He thus stressed the  significance of the group's formation.    Ouchi held an informal meeting with reporters after the  speech. Asked about demands inside the DSP and from labor unions  supporting DSP for his resignation as chairman, Ouchi said, "I  will have to reach a conclusion before the party convention (to  be held on 7 and 8 June)."</p>

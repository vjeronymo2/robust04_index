"Only through indomitable will and fortitude of the  fraternal  peoples and a desire to live together, we shall be able to  attain the cherished goal or we shall get lost one by one," the  statement said.    Rutskoy believes that over the past three years "the reality  itself proved that the CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States)  is non-viable" and that "the people have come to realise in full  the price of the irresponsible and light-minded decision to  dismantle the Soviet Union".    At the same time the former vice-president is convinced it  is  impossible to prevent the country "from slipping down into an  abyss through meetings, demonstrations and irresponsible  statements that border on a political provocation".    Rutskoy considers it necessary to comprehend this and look  for more effective forms for rapprochement and cooperation in an  atmosphere of an intensifying disintegration, economic, social  and political crisis. He did not specify what forms he had in  mind.</p>

			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FICTION IN BRIEF: OBSCENE GESTURES FOR WOMEN BY JANET KAUFFMAN (KNOPF: $16.95;  110 PP.)  </P> <P> Janet Kauffman's short stories pose overtly feminist questions in a thoroughly  undogmatic way. Men are not the enemy. Her women live happily with gentle  companions. But the women discover that they are strangers in the world,  disenfranchised by the masculinity of the forms of expression -- the gestures  of the title. The opening story, a surrealistic fantasy, sets the scene: A man  accidentally comes upon a flock of woman-birds in a field. They seem to be  creatures he has never seen before, but he recognizes that they are women  acting is a way no man has ever observed. The voices in the stories that follow  could be the individuals in this exotic flock.  </P> <P> Marimba, the narrator in the title story, has perfect teeth. Her pleasure in  their appearance collapses, however, when she discovers that the smoothness of  their beveled edges comes from her habit of grinding her teeth in her sleep.  For years she had prided herself on her firm jaw muscles: "In her ignorance,  she thought when she looked in the mirror: this is how a woman's face matures."  When she takes her newly-discovered troubles to a hypnotherapist -- male, of  course -- he instructs her to "display hostility rather than self-inflict it. .  . . You don't know how many men go around, surreptitiously giving their bosses  the finger." Here Marimba rebels; she can't "give the finger." A new vocabulary  of obscene gestures is needed for women, she argues: "Couldn't he see that  physiologically, women do not screw the world? I said, Give me an obscene  gesture for women, and sure, I'd use it." Sonja Bolle  </P></p>

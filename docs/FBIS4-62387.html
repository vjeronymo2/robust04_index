			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Leonid Vinogradov] </F>   [Text] Vladivostok May 16 TASS -- The gigantic blast of  ammunition in the village of Novonezheno in Russia's Far Eastern  Maritime Territory on May 14 lasted for several hours as nearly  1,600 tonnes of bombs and various missiles, as well as landmines  and artillery shells exploded one by one and in groups,  showering the ground with fragments and splinters for miles  around. Several shells and missiles hit the city of Bolshoy  Kamen, many kilometres from Novonezhino.    This was announced on Monday at a press conference for  Russian and foreign journalists by the head of administration of  the Maritime Territory Yevgeniy Nazdratenko. He also said that  units of field engineers are being brought to the Maritime  Territory from Russia's entire Pacific rim to clean up the  effects of the accident. They are expected to thoroughly inspect  the entire affected territory, locate and eliminate any  unexploded ammunition. Yevgeniy Nazdratenko said the bombs,  missiles and shells which have remained intact in the storage  facilities will be exploded, and the facility will never be  restored in the same place, particularly since the local  inhabitants had expressed their disagreement with its location  for some time past.</p>

			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / International Company News: PC maker's share slide continues Shares of AST Research, the fifth-largest personal computer manufacturer, dropped sharply yesterday when the company confirmed Wall Street concerns about slower-than-expected sales growth in the current quarter. AST, one of the fastest-growing companies in the PC industry, was trading at Dollars 24 in mid-session yesterday, down from Tuesday's close of Dollars 28 3/4 . This followed a 9 per cent drop on Tuesday. For the fiscal year ended July 3 1993, AST lost Dollars 53.8m, or Dollars 1.72 a share, on sales of Dollars 1.41bn. The loss reflected a Dollars 125m pre-tax restructuring charge related to the company's acquisition of Tandy's PC manufacturing operations in July 1993. For the first half of fiscal 1994, the company reported net income of Dollars 26.2m, or 79 cents, on revenues of Dollars 1.2bn. Several brokerage firms lowered their ratings on AST after the company said its February sales were strong, but below projections. Growth here was about 60 per cent over the same month last year, rather than an expected 70 per cent increase. Other PC stocks also came under pressure. At midday in New York, Apple Computer was down Dollars 1 at Dollars 35 1/4 . Compaq Computer dropped Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 95 1/4 .</p>

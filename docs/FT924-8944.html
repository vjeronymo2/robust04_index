			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / Barre plea for stronger German links FRANCE and Germany are likely to establish monetary union with a small 'core' of European countries if either Britain or Denmark fails to ratify the Maastricht treaty, according to Mr Raymond Barre, the former French prime minister. Mr Barre, a stalwart of the centre-right UDF party in the French national assembly, coupled this prediction with a plea for further measures to strengthen Franco-German monetary co-operation. He recommended that France should adopt a narrower fluctuation band within the European Monetary System to tie the franc still closer to the D-Mark. This compared with the present allowed margin for the franc against the D-Mark of 2 1/4 per cent either side of the central rate. Such a move to 'narrow bands' would strengthen the monetary solidarity by the Bundesbank's support of the franc during the September currency upheavals, Mr Barre said in an interview in London. Mr Barre, prime minister for two spells in 1976-1978 and 1978-1981, prides himself on providing part of the intellectual stimulus behind the 'hard franc' policy followed by the present Socialist government. Commenting on France's battle with the currency markets six weeks ago, Mr Barre said 'international circles, men who can manage big flows of capital' wanted to 'test the strength of the Franco-German (monetary) accord'. Mr Michel Sapin, French finance minister, announced last week that the Bank of France had succeeded in repaying all the funds borrowed from the Bundesbank to finance franc support intervention. 'FFr160bn (Dollars 31.06bn) was spent by the Bank of France. But the funds have been paid back quickly,' Mr Barre said. He declared that the Bundesbank gave support to the franc not simply for political reasons, but also because the German central bank was convinced that fundamental economic factors made a franc devaluation undesirable. Mr Barre, a strong supporter of the Maastricht treaty, campaigned for a Yes vote in the French referendum on September 20. 'If the speculation (against the franc) had been succeesful, the future of the Maastricht treaty would have been more compromised than by a failure of the referendum,' he said. Mr Barre said the EC wanted to proceed with a treaty on European union acceptable to all 12 members. However, if some countries did not ratify the treaty, 'the other countries can consider it justified to make something by themselves which would be a more limited Community - a 'hard core,'' Mr Barre said. If 'two or three countries' rejected the treaty, the 'hard core' could consider speeding up progress towards economic and monetary union (Emu), he said. Mr Barre urged the French government to make the Bank of France independent in stage two of the drive towards Emu, due to start in 1994. He said stage two should also bring about a gradual pooling of European central banks' currency reserves - a step currently opposed by the Bundesbank. Mr Barre criticised President Francois Mitterrand's statement during the referendum campaign that the planned European central bank should be subordinate to European governments. 'He (Mr Mitterrand) has accepted (in the Maastricht treaty) the independence of the European central bank. If he thinks the central bank will be dependent on the political authorities, I think he's wrong. He will never get the result he wants.' Mr Barre also cautioned about Britain's September departure from the European exchange rate mechanism. Sterling's devalution might produce 'artificial benefits' by boosting growth in the short term - but the advantages would soon be swallowed up in higher inflation.</p>

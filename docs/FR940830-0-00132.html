Except for purposes of facilitating lawful immigration, cash remittances to Cuba will only be permitted for limited humanitarian purposes through case&hyph;by&hyph;case specific licensing.

Accordingly, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (``FAC'') is amending the Cuban Assets Control Regulations, 31 CFR Part 515 (the ``Regulations''), to implement these measures by revising existing provisions that heretofore have generally authorized travel&hyph;related transactions, cash remittances, and the shipment of gift parcels to Cuba. Specifically, &sect;515.533 no longer authorizes exportation to Cuba of gift parcels pursuant to General License GIFT, &sect;771.18 of the Export Administration Regulations, 15 CFR Parts 768&hyph;799 (the ``EAR''), except those containing only food, vitamins, seeds, medicines, medical supplies and devices, hospital supplies and equipment, equipment for the handicapped, clothing, personal hygiene items, veterinary medicines and supplies, fishing equipment and supplies, soap&hyph;making equipment, or certain radio equipment and batteries for such equipment. The complete list of eligible items is set forth in &sect;771.18 of the EAR.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 515.560 of the Regulations is revised to limit the categories of travelers to Cuba who are generally authorized to engage in travel&hyph;related transactions to journalists and officials of the United States or foreign governments or international organizations traveling on official business. ``Fully&hyph;hosted'' travelers are no longer authorized to travel aboard charter flights between the United States and Cuba. Section 515.416 is revised to set forth the criteria by which specific licenses may be issued for travel&hyph;related transactions for ``professional research.'' Travel transactions by close relatives of Cuban nationals may only be authorized on a case&hyph;by&hyph;case basis by specific license, and only under circumstances of extreme hardship. Specific licenses for travel&hyph;related transactions may still be issued for other strictly humanitarian purposes, for clearly defined educational or religious activities, for activities of recognized human rights organizations investigating human rights violations, or for activities related to professional research, telecommunications, or the exportation, importation or transmission of information or informational materials. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 515.563, which previously provided general authorization for family remittances for the support of close relatives in Cuba, is revised to permit transfers of funds to Cuba only if authorized on a case&hyph;by&hyph;case basis for humanitarian purposes upon a demonstration of extreme hardship. However, payments not exceeding $500 to facilitate a close relative's lawful immigration to the United States remain generally licensed. All other general authorizations contained in the Regulations for remittances are revoked. In particular, &sect;515.564 is revised to specify that remittances to Cuba for purposes of facilitating a Cuban national's travel to the United States for purposes other than immigration may only be made pursuant to a specific license. Similarly prohibited are remittances to Cuba in connection with intellectual property protection (&sect;515.528) and public performances (&sect;515.565). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because the Regulations involve a foreign affairs function, Executive Order 12866 and provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553, requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, opportunity for public participation, and delay in effective date are inapplicable. Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required for this rule, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612, does not apply. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List Of Subjects in 31 CFR Part 515 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Administrative practice and procedure, Cuba, Exports, Foreign trade, Intellectual property, Remittances, Travel restrictions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons set forth in the preamble, 31 CFR part 515 is amended as set forth below: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 515_CUBAN ASSETS CONTROL REGULATIONS <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

Section 515.416 is revised to read as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;515.416 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 -->  Professional research and similar activities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Section 515.560(b) sets forth the criteria by which specific licenses for transactions related to travel to, from, and within Cuba may be issued for persons who are engaging in professional research and similar activities of a noncommercial, academic nature. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Persons are considered to be engaged in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> professional research <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  for purposes of this section only if they are full&hyph;time professionals who travel to Cuba to do research in their professional areas, their research is specifically related to Cuba and will constitute a full work schedule in Cuba, and there is a substantial likelihood of public dissemination of the product of their research. No transactions related to tourist or recreational travel within Cuba are authorized in connection with professional research, except those that are consistent with a full schedule of research activities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Similar activities <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  include attendance by professionals with an established interest in Cuba at professional meetings where research on Cuba is shared, and travel for noncommercial research purposes specifically related to Cuba by persons who are working to qualify themselves academically as professionals (e.g., certain graduate degree candidates). Study visits to Cuba in connection with pre&hyph;college or undergraduate college course work are not within the scope of the term  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> professional research and similar activities <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Categories of travel which do not qualify as professional research or similar activities and for which specific license requests will be denied include recreational travel; tourist travel; travel in pursuit of a hobby; general study tours; general orientation visits; student class field trips; youth camps; research for personal satisfaction only; travel by fishing or bird&hyph;watching groups and similar affinity groups; and any travel for an authorized research purpose, if the schedule of activities includes free time, travel, or recreation in excess of that consistent with a full work schedule of professional research and similar activities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) A group does not fall within the scope of the term  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> professional research and similar activities <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  merely because some members of the group could qualify individually for specific licensing under this category. For example, a specific license authorizing travel&hyph;related transactions by a fish biologist who travels to Cuba to engage in professional research does not authorize other persons who might travel with the fish biologist but whose principal purpose in travel is to engage in recreational or trophy fishing. The fact that such persons may engage in certain activities with, or under the direction of, the professional fish biologist, such as measuring or recording facts about their catch, does not bring these individuals' activities within the scope of professional research and similar activities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) A person will not qualify as engaging in professional research or similar activities merely because that person is a professional who plans to travel to Cuba. For example, a professor of history interested in traveling to Cuba for the principal purpose of learning or practicing Spanish or attending general purpose lectures devoted to Cuban culture and contemporary life would not qualify for a specific license. A doctoral candidate in economics traveling to Cuba to undertake research for a dissertation on the Cuban economy may qualify for a specific license for activities directly related to the research, but would not be authorized to stay an extra week in Cuba in order to attend a seminar on Cuban arts and crafts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart E_Licenses, Authorizations, and Statements of Licensing Policy <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;515.522 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> [Removed and reserved] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 3.

Paragraph (g) of &sect;515.560 is amended by adding after the word ``provided'' in the last sentence thereof the words ``that the travel is not aboard a direct flight between the United States and Cuba and'' and by revising paragraphs (a) and (b) to read as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;515.560  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Certain transactions incident to travel to and within Cuba. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> General license <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .

Specific licenses authorizing the transactions in paragraph (c) of this section may be issued when extreme hardship is demonstrated in cases involving extreme humanitarian need to persons and their close relatives, or other persons living in the same household, who are traveling to visit close relatives in Cuba. Specific licenses may also be issued to persons demonstrating a compelling need to travel to Cuba for humanitarian reasons, for professional research and similar activities as defined in &sect;515.416, for clearly defined educational or religious activities, for activities of recognized human rights organizations investigating human rights violations, or for purposes related to the exportation, importation, or transmission of information or informational materials. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) For purposes of this section, the term  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> close relative <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  means spouse, child, grandchild, parent, grandparent, great grandparent, uncle, aunt, brother, sister, nephew, niece, first cousin, or spouse, widow, or widower of any of the foregoing. The term  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> close relative <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  also means mother&hyph;in&hyph;law, father&hyph;in&hyph;law, daughter&hyph;in&hyph;law, son&hyph;in&hyph;law, sister&hyph;in&hyph;law, or brother&hyph;in&hyph;law. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Nothing in this section authorizes transactions in connection with tourist travel to Cuba.

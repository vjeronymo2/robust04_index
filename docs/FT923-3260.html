			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Third world debt crisis continues, OECD warns BANKS and governments may be getting the upper hand over the third world debt crisis but it has not gone away and poor countries will have to fight hard to win more funds in coming years, the OECD said today Reuter reports from Paris. 'The debt problem has certainly not been resolved nor has it at all gone away in any global sense,' the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said in its annual aid report. The Paris-based think-tank for the world's richest countries noted that while the crisis had eased in Latin America, where most of the main debtors are, the problems for sub-Saharan Africa had worsened. Since government lenders were now looking much more closely at issues such as human rights and democracy when deciding which developing countries to help, political reforms must continue. At the same time, the third world will need to persevere with economic liberalisation to attract private finance, since a big increase in official aid is unlikely in the near future. The OECD praised bank and government creditors for reaching landmark deals with certain developing country debtors. 'There have been clear improvements in a number of countries, which are now implementing better economic and structural adjustment policies, assisted by debt agreements. Nevertheless, the situation remains critical for many others.' The OECD applauded the debt deals reached with commercial banks by several Latin American countries  - including Mexico, which set off the third world debt crisis a decade ago  - saying these had played a part in turning round their economies. Against that, 'the low and declining volume of private flows (to sub-Saharan Africa) remains a cause of continued concern.' The Paris Club of government creditors has helped to bring a solution to the debt problem closer, notably by offering more favourable rescheduling terms since December 1991 to countries deemed serious about reforming their economies. More important, the OECD said, is the Paris Club's new policy of offering a deal on a country's total debt stock  - in effect, a promise to write off at least half of its debt  - on condition that economic adjustment plans are adhered to. The OECD estimated total third world debt at the end of 1991 at Dollars 1,480bn (Pounds 751.2bn) up slightly from Dollars 1,440bn in 1990. Partly as a result of the various debt deals, debt service payments made by third world countries fell to Dollars 150.9bn in 1991 from Dollars 159.1bn in 1990. Funds received by these countries from all sources  - governments, banks, multilateral agencies, financial markets  - rose to Dollars 137.5bn in 1991 from Dollars 137.2bn in 1990. The third world thus paid back more than it got from the rich world in 1991, though the OECD put a rosy gloss on that. Funding in 1991 was higher than the record level of 1990, it said, adding: 'This situation is particularly heartening in view of the economic and political situation prevailing in 1991.' It found little evidence that the countries of central and eastern Europe and the republics of the former Soviet Union had siphoned off more of the development funds available. On the other hand, the transformation of the ex-communist states saw aid from eastern Europe collapse to about Dollars 1bn in 1991, less than a quarter of the levels of the late 1980s. Total lending from non-official sources rose in 1991 to Dollars 55.4bn from Dollars 52.6bn in 1990, but the OECD said official flows from its member countries and the multilateral agencies would remain the main source of third world development funds.</p>

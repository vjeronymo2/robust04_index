			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Avoiding holes in the doughnut theory - Essex: Paddy Ashdown NEVER HAS so much been staked on Essex man as when Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, visited Brentwood yesterday. 'Essex is going to lead the way towards the new politics that Britain wants,' Mr Ashdown told the media scrum outside a local training centre. He was determined not to be squeezed  - either physically by journalists or by the Labour and Tory parties. Mr Ashdown's tactic is to exude Churchillian confidence, of the 'go back to your constituencies and prepare for government' variety of Sir David Steel, former Liberal leader. 'Essex people'  - as described by Ms Elizabeth Bottomley, Liberal Democrat candidate in Brentwood and Ongar  - were buoyant, but not that buoyant. Liberal Democrats have no MPs in Essex; the smallest Tory majority on Mr Ashdown's tour of the county yesterday was almost 14,000. As the Liberal Democrat roadshow hit Colchester  - photo opportunity No 2, as set out in a briefing note  - Mr Ashdown pulled enough crowds to block the High Street. 'Where is the hope?' he asked of the Labour and Tory manifestos in a prearranged impromptu sound bite for lunchtime TV. 'What does he mean, 'Where is the Pope'?' asked a male shopper at the rear. Setting off across the road to begin a Royal Marine-style yomp around the shops, a builder shouted from his van: 'I would have laid down my coat if it had been Mrs Thatcher.' Pensioners and shoppers were brushed aside, and television camera crews struggled to keep up. 'It's an experience,' said one elderly lady innocently as she was pinned against the wall. Crowding into a bakery, a local activist shouted: 'Is the election going to be a piece of cake?' Mr Ashdown searched, in vain, for the apposite riposte. 'We are the jam at the centre of the doughnut,' he declared finally. Watch out, the squeeze could be messy.</p>

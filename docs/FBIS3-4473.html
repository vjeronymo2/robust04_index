At present, it is necessary to vigorously open  new channels for capital accommodation and boldly adopt the new  means of funds, B shares, and B bonds to attract foreign  investment.    To this end, Liu Jinbao submitted a motion to the congress.  He said that use of foreign capital is a major policy for  accelerating China's economic development. With the major  readjustment of the international economic structure since the  1990's, marked changes have taken place in the demand-supply  structure of international capital, which has the following new  trend: The flow of international capital has markedly decreased  and there is an increasing demand; many developed countries have  become the focus of international capital; and accommodation of  international capital through securities has become the main  form of international capital flow.    In view of the above new circumstances, Liu Jinbao said,  China should diversify its use of foreign capital based on  strengthening macroeconomic management in this field. Besides  taking foreign loans and running three kinds of foreign-funded  enterprises, three new forms of funds, B shares, and B bonds  should also be adopted. Funds have the characteristics of low  risks and high earnings and are welcome by medium and small  international investors. As for the fundraisers, funds are  different from bank loans, which do not increase the state's  debt burden and can also reduce the cost of fundraising and  increase efficiency.    Liu Jinbao said that B shares can be expanded from the  following four aspects: The B shares issuers should be extended  from enterprises obtaining foreign exchange through exports to  efficient ordinary domestic enterprises to attract more foreign  investment; the scope of trade of B shares issuers should be  further expanded; the markets and prices for A and B shares  should be unified; and a number of well-known foreign securities  companies should be selected to set up exchanges in Shanghai.  This can reduce the intermediate links and and increase market  operation efficiency. While issuing B bonds, the scale should  not be too big in the early stages and the capacity of foreign  exchange and bearing capacity of the inhabitants and units  should be taken into full consideration. It is necessary to  gradually establish the second tier market for B bonds and  strengthen their circulation.    Liu Jinbao said that operation of the abovementioned new  forms of capital accommodation can further broaden the channel  of the use of foreign capital and also improve China's  securities market and create conditions for it to converge with  the international market at an early date.</p>

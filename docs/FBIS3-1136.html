			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report]  <H6>  SUNDAY TIMES </H6>   Goldstone Commission Report -- "President de Klerk has acted  properly in suspending from duty all the police officers  implicated by the Goldstone Commission in a wide variety of evil  activities, ranging from massacre by hit squads to train and  hostel violence, gun running, the frustration of criminal  inquiries, destruction of evidence, and more," an editorial in  the Johannesburg SUNDAY TIMES in English on 20 March on page 28  states. "The evidence collected by the Goldstone Commission is  voluminous and credible" and suggests the AK-47 assault rifles  "used in many criminal attacks on innocent people may be traced  back, not to smugglers from Mozambique, but to the SAP [South  African Police]." Minister of Law and Order Kriel "may have been  kept in the dark" and Police Commissioner General van der Merwe  "kept himself in the dark, diligently ignorant of the causes of  the slaughter that has afflicted this country for years. However  in both cases it is incomprensible that Mr de Klerk has failed  to remove them from office, at least until the Goldstone  investigations and the criminal investigations that must surely  follow, are complete." The mystery is why Mr de Klerk clings "to  the old guard under whose dubious supervision the rot set in."  <H6>  SUNDAY NATION </H6>   Delaying Tactics -- The Goldstone Commission report "that  there is a Third Force that has been perpetrating violence in  the past four years" is welcome, "however we do not understand  why the commission's report was not forwarded to the Attorney  General for the immediate prosecution of those implicated," an  editorial in Johannesburg SUNDAY NATION in English on 20 March  on page 6 notes. "The reluctance to detain the generals is  likely to allow those implicated to interfere with  investigations." "We cannot help but charge that De Klerk's  strategy of ordering investigations instead of detentions is yet  another delaying tactic in the hope the issue will be  forgotten." "The ANC [African National Congress], through its  influence in the TEC [Transitional Executive Council] should  ensure that the entire command structure of the police be placed  in neutral hands until a democratic government formally acquires  the instruments of power. This includes removing Kriel from  office."    King Zwelithini's Proclamation -- "Zulu King Goodwill  Zwelithini's Friday proclamation of kwaZulu/Natal as a sovereign  kingdom and calls to his subjects to defend it at all costs,  have confirmed our suspicions that he is nothing more than a  puppet for Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) leader Mangosuthu  Buthelezi," the second editorial in the SUNDAY NATION on 20  March on page 6 notes. "To us, it seems the high-profile  Buthelezi -- under pressure from leading international figures  to join the national elections -- has opted to push the King  forward to make pronouncements on his behalf and then claim to  be supporting the position as a 'servant' of the monarch."  "Maybe it is time that the King refrained from politics and left  this to politicians."  <H6>  WEEKEND STAR </H6>   "Breathtaking Litany of Shame" -- "The latest accusations  against rogue policemen take the breath away," the "prima facie  evidence" comes from "officers of the highest callibre, ranging  from majors to a general, have been party to to the most damning  exposure of third force activity so far," an editorial in the  Johannesburg WEEKEND STAR in English on 19-20 March on page 14  notes. "Only one man has the power to act effectively: President  de Klerk." "All the police officers named in the report must be  suspended immediately, not sent on leave, and those men  implicated who are not members of the SAP must not be allowed to  skip the country." "De klerk must replace the Commissioner of  Police General Johan van der Merwe, not only because the general  bears ultimate responsibility, but because his lack of interest  in bringing his own men to book is glaringly evident. Law and  Order Minister Hernus Kriel's performance must also come inder  scrutiny."  <H6>  RAPPORT </H6>   Urgent Action Needed on `Third Force' -- The Johannesburg  RAPPORT in Afrikaans of 20 March points out in a page-20  editorial: "In the storm over possible involvement of senior  policemen in a so-called Third Force which allegedly sowed  violence, there is at present little more than allegations  against certain people, and vehement denials." "The independent  investigating team will have to present evidence which can be  laid before a court, and on which a court must decide. The  matter has been raised by the Goldstone Commission critical days  before an election, and therefore it needs to be dealt with as  speedily as possible. Those who are guilty must be punished by  the court without delay, but the innocent must not have to live  for months under the cloud of untested accusations. Not only  they but the whole country is feeling a degree of uncertainty  over the trustworthiness of the upholders of the law. Let us  not have a repeat of the dismissal of military officers after  the Goldstsone raid on the offices of Military Intelligence. As  far as we can remember, not a single one of them has to date  been convicted in a court of law, and some of them have in fact  been reappointed to their posts. The question still remains  over where the mistake lay: with the officers who were accused,  or with the rash actions of the Goldstone Commission. With the  election little more than a month away, this case must be  treated with double the urgency."</p>

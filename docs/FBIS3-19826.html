			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Geoff Meade, PRESS ASSOCIATION, in Brussels] </F>   [Text] Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring today left the  Brussels talks on voting rights -- challenging Britain to change  its "illogical position." Mr Spring said it was not a walkout,  but he had to be back in Dublin tonight for a cabinet meeting.    An Irish Government spokesman admitted: "He would have  stayed  longer if he had thought there was any chance of reaching  agreement today." Mr Spring said the failure to decide the  balance of voting in the enlarged European Union was a failure  of leadership. "This is not the best example to be giving. We  may well be running out of time."    He said there was no sign at all of a compromise by Britain  and Spain -- both fighting to keep the "blocking minority" vote  at 23 -- and the other 10 -- insisting it must increase to 27.    "I have difficulty understanding the British position," said  Mr Spring. "If we don't resolve this then we will be facing a  very difficult situation. Positions have not changed today,"  added Mr Spring.    He left the talks after an inconclusive lunch between the  foreign ministers and amid signs of a tougher stand on both  sides. Officials said Britain was pressing for a "protocol"  formally limiting the blocking minority vote to 23.    In what was seen as a sign of growing frustration Holland,  Belgium and Luxembourg retaliated with a threat to hold the  "qualified majority" at 54.    This would neatly turn the tables on Mr Hurd by demanding a  freeze at present levels on the voting balance in favour instead  of against Euro legislation. The effect would be to make  agreements easier -- and push up the "blocking minority" to 37.    Mr Spring said he hoped to see signs of compromise from  Britain when foreign ministers meet in Greece at the weekend.  Other member states were talking of imposing a two-week  deadline on Britain to give Mr Hurd a breathing space to talk  the Tory Euro sceptics round to what is seen as inevitable -- a  legal requirement for a new "blocking minority" of 27.</p>

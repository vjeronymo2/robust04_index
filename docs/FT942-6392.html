			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / NatWest warns of interest rate rise Interest rates will rise 1.5 percentage points over the next year, touching 6.75 per cent by next summer, National Westminster Bank warns today. A report by the bank predicts the rise will begin this autumn, with rates going from 5.25 per cent to 5.75 per cent by the end of this year. This prediction is gloomier that most City forecasts but roughly in line with the interest rate levels now assumed in sterling futures markets. Meanwhile, the Nomura research institute has warned that the current account deficit could severely undermine sterling if it deteriorates any further. In a report that seeks to challenge the common view that the trade gap is manageable because it is 'financeable', Nomura argues that international capital flows are not as mobile as believed.</p>

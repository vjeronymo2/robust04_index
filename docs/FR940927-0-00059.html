			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because the proposed revisions to these previously-approved sections of the Utah Coal Mining and Reclamation Act are nonsubstantive in nature, the Director finds that these proposed statutes are no less stringent than SMCRA. The Director approves the proposed revisions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Substantive Revisions to Utah's Statutes That Are Substantively Identical to Provisions of SMCRA and the Federal Regulations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Utah proposed revisions to the following provisions of the Utah Coal Mining and Reclamation Act that are substantive in nature and contain language that is substantively identical to the provisions of SMCRA and the Federal regulations (listed in parentheses). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=1 --> UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;20(2) (section 518(c) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 723.19 and 723.20), informal conferences, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;20(3)(e) (section 518(b) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 723.20), public hearings, and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;28.1(6) (section 411(f) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 875.15(d)), certification of completion of coal reclamation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because these proposed revisions to the Utah Coal Mining and Reclamation Act are substantively identical to the corresponding provisions of SMCRA and the Federal regulations, the Director finds that they are no less stringent than SMCRA and no less effective than the Federal regulations. The Director approves the proposed revisions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 3. UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;14(6), Appeal to District Court <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Previously-approved UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;14(6), regarding Board decisions on permit applications, provided, in part, that: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Any applicant, or any person with an interest which is or may be adversely affected who has participated in the proceedings as an objector, and who is aggrieved by the decision of the board, or if the board fails to act within the time limits specified in [Title 40, Chapter 10], has the right to appeal in the district court for the county in which the proposed operation is located. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In this amendment, Utah proposed to add language to UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;14(6) to provide that any party to the action in district court may appeal from the final judgment, order, or decree of the district court. Utah also proposed deletion of the provision that required that review of the adjudication of the district court is by the Utah Supreme Court. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By way of clarification, Utah provided additional information, stating, among other things, that, where an appeal of the Board's decision is the issue at hand, ``the record established by the Board in the hearing transcript becomes the trial record which is reviewed by the Utah Supreme Court'' (administration record No. UT&hyph;949). Utah further stated that where the Board fails to act, relief may be sought by an applicant or interested person in the State district court for the county where the proposed operation is located. ``Under these conditions, the case or controversy is heard by state District Court and it then becomes the court of record. Appeals are thereafter to the Utah Supreme Court.'' The State cited provisions of the Utah Judicial Code at UCA Title 78, Chapter 2, as support for its explanation of the appellate process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 526(e) of SMCRA provides, in part, that action taken by a State regulatory authority under an approved State program is subject to judicial review by a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with State law. Although the Director finds the clarifying information to be consistent with section 526(e) of SMCRA, the Director finds that the currently-approved Utah program contains some apparent internal inconsistencies regarding the appellate process for Board decisions on permit applications. That is, although UCA 78&hyph;2&hyph;2(3)(e)(iv) appears to specify, as Utah stated in its clarifying information, that appeals of Board decisions are to the Utah Supreme Court, the first sentence of UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;14(6), previously approved by OSM, appears to require that such appeals are to the State district court in the county where the proposed operation is located. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / Bombay exchange open after scandal TRADERS yesterday resumed dealing on the Bombay stock exchange after a month-long absence as a result of the arrest of two top brokers and the attachment of their property in the Rs35bn (Pounds 650m) securities market scandal. Share values fell, and the 30-share index was down 177 points to 2,912, with trading restricted to some 250 issues against the normal 1,500. The index was down 35 per cent from a peak 4,467 on April 22. The brokers had sought freedom to trade in all shares, including those dealt by the disgraced brokers, Mr Harshad Mehta and Mr Bhupen Dalal. But the custodian appointed by the government said each lot traded by the two brokers had to be checked and approved for trading. Under a compromise, traders have agreed to deal provisionally in shares that do not attract attachment by the custodian. Unit Trust of India, the main mutual fund, which has been objecting to taking delivery of shares brokered by Mr Mehta, was the main buyer yesterday. The exchange set daily limits on the amounts of shares each broker could sell. Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, said his government would never allow destruction of a mosque in the northern town of Ayodhya so that Hindus could build a temple on the site. Mr Rao made his statement to parliament in a debate on an opposition no-confidence motion the government expects to win.</p>

			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / International Company News: Computer group seeks unity on Unix A GROUP of leading computer companies yesterday announced plans to develop a 'unified' version of Unix, the computer operating system software that has long been touted as a standard for 'open systems' - computers that can share software and data. The move follows years of industry in-fighting. The group includes IBM, Hewlett-Packard and Sun Microsystems as well as software companies The Santa Cruz Operation, Novell and Unix System Laboratories, a unit of AT&amp;T. It said that it would work to establish software standards. There are numerous incompatible versions of Unix, and the fragmentation has caused confusion, stunting the growth of open systems. By establishing a standard version of Unix, the group aims to encourage software developers to write new applications programs for Unix, thus making their computer and software products more attractive. Over the past few years there has been a series of failed efforts by industry groups to establish a single standard version of Unix.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] After lengthy internal meetings and conversations,  the PFL [Liberal Front Party] has designated Alagoas Senator  Guilherme Palmeira as Fernando Henrique Cardoso's running mate  for the presidential elections of 3 October.    The PFL also considered the designation of Senator Marco  Maciel, but he declined.    The PFL informed Senator Fernando Henrique Cardoso of the  designation during a lunch. Cardoso was satisfied with the  designation. He said:    [Begin Cardoso recording] It is a good choice because we  need  someone from the northeastern region, with political experience,  with well-known positions, and who will be accepted by the PSDB  [Brazilian Social Democracy Party]. Guilherme Palmeira meets  these requirements. In addition, he can help us a lot because  he is a factor for unity within the PFL, and this is important  for the electoral contest in the northeastern region. [end  recording]    The PSDB is scheduled to hold its convention on 14 May in  Contagem, Minas Gerais. The convention will formalize Senator  Cardoso's designation as presidential candidate.</p>

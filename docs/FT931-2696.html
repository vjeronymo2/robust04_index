			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Romania calls for talks on Balkans THE Romanian foreign minister, Mr Teodor Melescanu, yesterday suggested a full-scale Balkan conference should be called to discuss the problems of the region, once a peace agreement settling the future of Bosnia-Hercegovina has been concluded. Mr Melescanu, who was in London for talks with Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, said such a conference should be attended not only by all the Balkan countries but by European Community members such as the UK and France, the US, Russia and other countries closely involved in the problems of the former Yugoslavia. After the end of the conflict in the former Yugoslavia, there would be an urgent need for the Balkan countries to discuss how they could contribute to the recovery and economic development of the devastated region. Solutions would also have to be found to the problems of disputed borders, treatment of ethnic minorities and the vast number of refugees scattered around the Balkans. In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Melescanu admitted that his country did not like applying economic sanctions against neighbouring Serbia. 'We don't like these sanctions because we think they are a bit like sanctions against ourselves,' he said. However, Mr Melescanu was quick to add that Romania respected the sanctions because they were the result of an international decision and the only alternative to military action. Though much publicity had been given to the sanctions-busting fuel supplies transported to Serbia in barges along the Danube - which Romania has recently attempted to block - these amounted to only about 1 per cent of Serbia's total needs, the minister said. In Belgrade, the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said Bosnian Serbs had allowed two UN aid convoys blocked on the border with Serbia since Monday to enter Bosnia yesterday. The trucks, which had crossed the border bridge at Mali Zvornik, were headed for the Moslem-held town of Gorazde and for Sarajevo. A third convoy with aid for Tuzla had also been cleared and was due to set out this morning. However, deadlock continued over a relief convoy to the stricken town of Srebrenica, which has been stuck at Mali Zvornik for the past week. Bosnian Serbs say the convoy cannot be accompanied by a UN military escort, on which the UN has insisted. Gen Philippe Morillon, UN military commander in Bosnia, has vowed to stay in Srebrenica until aid reaches the town. The EC is to contribute Dollars 1.2m in food parcels to be air-dropped into Bosnia by the US air force, Mr Manuel Marin, EC development and aid commissioner, announced yesterday, David Gardner reports from Brussels. The move follows pressure by Mr Hans van den Broek, EC external political relations commissioner, to develop a joint approach to the conflict in former Yugoslavia between the Community, the US and Russia. The EC has also been stung by the high media profile accorded the US air drops, given that the Community has provided nearly three-fifths of the relief aid to ex-Yugoslavia, and the overwhelming majority of the ground troops and officials who deliver this aid by land under near-impossible conditions.</p>

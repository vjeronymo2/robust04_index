			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Enforcement actions issued as a result of inspections at abandoned sites have proven to be ineffective at compelling abatement of violations or achieving reclamation. Moreover, inspectors normally have cited all violations prior to or shortly after a site becomes abandoned. The persons responsible for abating these violations typically are financially insolvent or cannot be located. In such instances, even when diligent efforts are made to enforce the Act, no one is available to abate violations or to perform or pay for the needed reclamation. Continuing regular partial and complete inspection of these sites serves no useful purpose and wastes finite inspection resources. To illustrate the extent of this waste, OSM has in the past conducted approximately 2,900 inspections each year on an average of 236 abandoned sites in Tennessee. This effort comprises approximately 32 percent of the inspections in that State; however, few, if any, of these inspections have resulted in abatement of violations or completion of reclamation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM experience has shown that environmental conditions at most abandoned sites do not significantly degrade what has been observed during prior inspections and that violations of substantive performance standards do not necessarily deteriorate to imminent danger or harm situations. While these sites do not comply with the Act, many, due to their age or because they were partially reclaimed prior to abandonment, become reasonably well stabilized through natural settlement and revegetation occurring over time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the stated goal of section 517 of the Act is to ``enforce the requirements of and carry out the purposes of [the] Act,'' inspecting abandoned sites as frequently as other sites covered by a permit frustrates rather than furthers this goal. Among the mechanisms provided by the Act to achieve the stated goals of section 517(c) are civil penalties under section 518, performance bonds under section 509 and 519, citizen suits under section 520, and enforcement under section 521. Each of these mechanisms has as its underlying premise the existence of a person against whom an action can be taken, or of a bond that can provide the funds to abate violations and secure reclamation. If no such person can be found, or if the regulatory authority is taking other appropriate legal actions to ensure reclamation or abatement, and any permit has been revoked and any bond is being forfeited, issuing multiple violation notices and cessation orders and assessing uncollectible penalties as a result of the fixed inspection frequency requirement are not productive tools to enforce the Act. The waste of resources also extends beyond the inspector level as other units within the regulatory authority must assess and attempt to collect civil penalties. Under the foregoing circumstances, inspections of abandoned sites performed at a minimum frequency less than that for other sites based on the particular characteristics of the site are a far more reasonable and realistic alternative. Moreover, the conservation of resources that will flow from this rule promotes the principles embodied in OSM's mission and vision statement by creating fair and more efficient and effective processes for achieving the objectives of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Discussion of Final Rule and Response to Public Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 840.10 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 840.10 is being revised to include an estimate of the average public reporting burden for the collections of information under all of Part 840 as such part is revised by this final rule. The section also lists the addresses for OSM and the Office of Management and Budget where comments on the information collection requirements may be sent. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Combined Section-by-Section Analysis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since the revisions adopted for State regulatory authorities at 840.11 are identical to those adopted at 842.11 where OSM is the regulatory authority, they will be combined for ease of discussion. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

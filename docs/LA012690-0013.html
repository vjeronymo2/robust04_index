			<p><P> January 26, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JURY'S NOT GUILTY VERDICT IN MCMARTIN PRE-SCHOOL CASE  </P> <P> Let us hope that the most important lesson to be learned from the McMartin  trial is taken to heart: The legal system relies far too much on the supposed  "expertise" of mental health "professionals."  </P> <P> Psychology is about as scientific as voodoo, and those who practice it have a  vested interest in identifying a psychological problem where none is present,  as only by doing this is their existence justified.  </P> <P> It is good that the jury saw that the children's testimony was the product of  suggestion, not reality. Unfortunately, not all juries or judges are so wise.  </P> <P> KEMP A. RICHARDSON  </P> <P> Lomita  </P></p>

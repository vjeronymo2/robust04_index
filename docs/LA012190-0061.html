			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BAY'S FUTURE RESTS ON PORT DISTRICT APPOINTMENTS;  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: NEW COMMISSIONERS COULD ENSURE THAT SAN DIEGO'S TIDELANDS ARE  CLEANED UP, RESTORED AND PROTECTED.  </P> <P> San Diego Bay is a key economic and environmental feature of the region. But  the bay's reputation as a polluted waterway attests to decades of exploitation.  An opportunity is now at hand to see that environmental protection of the bay  and its special natural resources are better represented and its potential to  serve all the people of San Diego is more fully realized.  </P> <P> The San Diego City Council will be making a critical decision shortly on whom  to appoint to two of the most important and powerful positions in the state of  California -- commissioners to the San Diego Unified Port District. The Port  District has authority over nearly all the tidelands in San Diego Bay. This  decision takes on even more importance given the numerous challenges ahead for  the commission.  </P> <P> The rush to develop bayfront acreage is accelerating amid evidence of 22  contaminated underground water sites in downtown San Diego alone. The new  Convention Center along with other construction projects have intruded into  these underground basins, and the sites may be drawing toxic contaminants  toward the bay.  </P> <P> Within the next few years, the fate of critical natural wetlands in the vast  southern part of San Diego Bay must be weighed against development. There are  proposals driven by very narrow special interests to build a second harbor  entrance. And San Diego may be the host in defending the America's Cup, which  would bring an unprecedented number of new tenants and visitors to the bay as  early as November.  </P> <P> It is time that the City Council and all San Diegans look to the future of our  great bay and the challenge that lies ahead: to clean up, restore and protect  San Diego Bay as a multi-use resource.  </P> <P> The Port District has the statutory responsibilities to promote navigation,  commerce, recreation and fisheries.  </P> <P> In the last two areas, a lot more can and will have to be done if we are to  even approach the goal set by the federal Clean Water Act nearly 20 years ago  to make this waterway "fishable and swimmable." The expenditures and progress  toward promoting fisheries and water-contact recreation in the 27 years since  the Port District's creation has been disappointing.  </P> <P> For instance, commercial fishermen report a significant diminishment in the  numbers of fish and the diversity of species in the bay. And many of the fish  they do find have tumors, lesions and evidence of other problems with their  bay-water habitat.  </P> <P> More importantly, the chairman of a port commission subcommittee recently  announced that bay water quality posed a negligible risk to human health from  water-contact activities such as swimming. However, this was based on surveys  of information and studies available on just two pollutants in the bay --  copper and tributyltin. Both pollutants have been used as anti-fouling agents  in boat-bottom coatings, and copper has been spilled in huge quantities as a  result of seven years of loading at the Port District's National City 24th  Street Terminal, which was leased to a private company.  </P> <P> This spill of copper resulted in the state naming the Port District a  primary-responsible party in the pollution of the bay. In fact, the Port  District has been named as a primary- and secondary-responsible party in a  number of orders to clean up toxic pollution of the bay. And the state now  designates the port as a responsible party for all of its tenants who have  pollution-discharge permits.  </P> <P> It is more than a little odd to have an agency that has been charged with  polluting this important resource able to pass judgment on water quality and  human health, especially given the complexity of this issue and the need for  more information about the extent of contamination and its effects on the bay  food chain.  </P> <P> The Port District has even declared the health risk from toxic contaminants in  Convair lagoon as minimal, and yet this area has been posted for nearly two  years with warning signs by the county Department of Health Services. Convair  lagoon has sediments containing some of the highest concentrations of PCBs on  the West Coast. Professor Jack Conway, a member of one of the Port District's  toxic waste advisory subcommittees, echoed the comments of other committee  members when he said it was "premature to make statements about the bay until  all the data is in."  </P> <P> At the same time that the public is being assured that there is little risk to  swimming in the bay, the Crosby Street park in Barrio Logan is off limits to  water-contact activities and fishing.  </P> <P> The Port District is paying for a health risk assessment study, which is being  conducted by county Department of Health Services. But the scope of the study  will be limited by the funding: $250,000. This is a minimal amount contrasted  with the port's annual budget of $80 million, with $162 million in reserves.  Surely some greater portion of these monies should be devoted to clean-up,  protection and restoration.  </P> <P> The Port District will not meet its statutory responsibilities by wishful  thinking and half-hearted support for the many studies and programs needed to  protect San Diego Bay.  </P> <P> Mayor Maureen O'Connor listed San Diego Bay and reforms to the Port District at  the top of the list for the "environmental protection package" attached to her  recent State of the City address: "The Port Act must be reviewed to assign  environmental protection and preservation a higher priority, instead of an  afterthought to economic development."  </P> <P> This is a fitting call to action for this new decade and the 20th anniversary  of Earth Day. We hope that the City Council will bear this in mind as it  considers the qualifications of the growing list of candidates to serve as new  port commissioners. With the Exxon Valdez undergoing repairs here in San Diego  Bay as a reminder of how fragile our marine environment is, the San Diego City  Council should be searching for commissioners with an understanding of  natural-resource issues and a real dedication and commitment to clean up,  restore and protect this great bay for all San Diegans to enjoy.  </P> <P> We can't afford to let this critical opportunity fall to political expediency.  We need a clean sweep of the past for a clean bay in the future.  </P></p>

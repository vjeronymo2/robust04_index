			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Airbus-Boeing jumbo studies to continue The four leading European aircraft manufacturers yesterday agreed with Boeing, the world's biggest aircraft maker, to continue until the middle of next year joint studies on the development of a 600-800 seat superjumbo airliner. After what was described as a 'lively meeting', the four European companies  -British Aerospace, Aerospatiale of France, Deutsche Aerospace and Casa of Spain - said the European Airbus consortium would also participate in the studies in an advisory role. All four European manufacturers are shareholders in Airbus Industrie and have been involved in joint studies with Boeing on a superjumbo for the past 14 months. Although the European Airbus partners agreed to continue the joint studies, they have also become concerned over Boeing's commitment to the joint project. Aerospatiale of France had shown growing reluctance to participate in the joint studies in the wake of the controversy over Saudi Arabia's recent decision to order Dollars 6bn (Pounds 4.1bn) worth of new airliners from Boeing and McDonnell Douglas of the US following pressure from the White House.</p>

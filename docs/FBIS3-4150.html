Dr Cheng who only returned to Hong Kong on  Thursday after being kept in China for seven months said he  supported Washington linking human rights with MFN.    "I think the U.S. Government will take my case as a  violation  of human rights in considering whether to give China MFN status.  The lack of human rights is just such a big problem in today's  China," said Dr Cheng, a former head of the Department of  Journalism and Communications of the Chinese University of Hong  Kong.    Dr Cheng was detained by the Changsha Eastern District  People's Court, in Hunan Province last August over a dispute  concerning his joint-venture business in China. He was held for  two months in Changsha of Hunan Province and his passport was  taken away.    The Chinese partner in his joint venture, the Hunan Arts and  Crafts Import and Export Corp (HACIEC), wanted to pull out from  the company and demanded the return of their investment. While  he agreed to return the money to the HACIEC, he was arrested by  court officials of the Changsha People's Eastern District Court  who also took away his passport.    At least four Hong Kong residents are still under detention  in China as a result of business disputes, according to figures  revealed by the Secretary for Security Alistair Asprey.  Pro-human rights activist John Kamm said yesterday that he  believed many other Hong Kong residents faced even longer  detention or worse treatment than Dr Cheng had experienced.    Hoping his case would raise public awareness of the  mainland's legal system, Dr Cheng plans to file two counter  charges -- a criminal charge against two Changsha judges for  alleged illegal detainment and confiscation of his passport  since August 26. Another civil charge would be filed against  HACIEC for the economic losses. "Many people chicken out. They  are so afraid of the mainland authorities that I have to speak  up as an example myself," he said.</p>

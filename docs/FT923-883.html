			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading A SQUEEZE towards the close enlivened an otherwise dull session in the derivatives area, writes Joel Kibazo. The December FT-SE futures contract opened 15 above Wednesday's close of 2,638, but the early strength soon faded, leaving the contract to drift down for most of the session, with sentiment weakened by the dullness in the fixed interest rate markets. By 3pm the December future had fallen to 2,628, which proved to be the low of the day. The closing of positions, mostly by independent traders, along with light buying by some institutions in the dying minutes of the session generated a squeeze, driving December forward and sending the underlying cash market higher. December closed at 2,683, up 45 from its previous close and around 22 points ahead of its fair value premium to cash of about 40. Turnover, at 6,316 lots, was thin. There was an improvement in volume in traded options, the total reaching 31,558 lots, although turnover in the FT-SE 100 option fell to 7,351 contracts. Food retailers led the way among stock options. Tesco recorded a day's total of 2,046 contracts, and was followed by Asda, in which 1,735 lots were transacted.</p>

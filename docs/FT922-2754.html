			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Survey of China (10): A crippling bill - Social Welfare/Housing ONE of the biggest issues facing policy makers in China is what to do about the country's cradle-to-grave social welfare and housing programmes. As China travels further down the road towards market reforms this system is looking not only too costly but also a positive inhibition to the reform of the economy. However, reform is complicated by a number of factors. First, the provision of social welfare and housing policy is not centralised, but is located in the workplaces of China's workers. Co-ordinating reform, therefore, requires balancing various bureaucratic interest, not only at a national but also a provincial and city level. Secondly, and most importantly, any far-reaching reform of social welfare and housing has large political implications, especially in the cities. China's current welfare policies were designed in 1950s to provide not only economic support for, but also political control of, the population. Chinese city workers are assigned to a danwei, or work unit, which circumscribes their daily life. The unit provides housing, health and education; it also approves marriage. Within the unit is stationed the public security bureau whose job it is to monitor and maintain files on the political attitudes of the workers. This is a powerful system, therefore, of welfare and social control and changing it has implications for both. Enter the World Bank. Its economists have recently concluded a study* of urban housing in China. It warns that without an urgent and comprehensive reform of China's housing policies attempts to further modernise the economy could fail. 'The ability of business enterprises to restructure themselves in response to market signals requires that firms be allowed to adjust the size of their operations, the nature of their products, and the location of their plants, while adding or shedding workers, as necessary . . . To do so a housing market must emerge that operates in a significantly different manner from today's administrative allocation model,' the study said. The past 12 years in China have witnessed the world's largest residential building spree. Between 1978 and 1990 China spent 8 per cent of its gross domestic product and 30 per cent of its total fixed capital investment on the creation of housing. Over that period about 150m square metres of living space were added annually, doubling the floor space available to the average urban dweller. However, with households in China's urban areas - and the problem is largely an urban one - devoting only 1 per cent of their monthly income to work-unit-provided housing there are no incentives for consumers to align demand for housing with their ability to purchase it. Housing is produced and financed by a supply-driven system that bears little relation to cost or recovery. As the bank observes, in most market economies the ratio of average house prices to average annual income is between 2:1 and 6:1. In China the ratio can exceed 20:1; the rents required to fully recover the cost of investment could be more than 70 per cent of average household income. Indeed, World Bank analysts are concerned that rents collected are insufficient to pay for minimal housing maintenance. If this is allowed to continue China could face a financially crippling bill for new housing within a decade or more as it deals with the replacement of its urban housing stock. Housing subsidies to urban residents have ballooned over the past decade. Between 1978 and 1988 the value of the subsidy has risen from Y4.7bn to Y58.4bn - an 11 1/2 fold increase. In 1978, 80.6 per cent of an urban resident's income used to be in the form of cash and bonuses; housing subsidies accounted for 6.7 per cent, welfare subsidies 11 per cent, and price subsidies 1.6 per cent of income. By 1988, and in spite of the economic reforms introduced, subsidies had come to play and even more important role. Salary accounted for 62 per cent of income, the housing subsidy had doubled to 15.6 per cent of income, while welfare subsidies had risen to 11 per cent and price subsidies trebled to 4.8 per cent of income. The government's response to the growing burden of housing on the exchequer has been to experiment with various market-linked reforms. Rents have been raised and home ownership has been introduced on a trial basis in some cities. In general, however, the World Bank study found that the reforms to date had done little to resolve outstanding issues including property rights, urban planning, the diversification of housing producers and the creation of housing finance institutions based on prudent criteria. They have also done little to encourage home ownership. In Yantai, in Shandong province, where reforms have gone deepest, the scheme mobilises savings at negative real interest rate and re-lends at slightly higher rates, subject to onerous down payment conditions and a mortgage repayment schedule of 10 to 15 years. Beijing and Shanghai are conducting experiments with owner occupation but, in common with Yantai and other cities, they balk at cutting the knot which ties the worker to his workplace. The failure of the authorities to contemplate this has large implications for economic reform more broadly. The World Bank said that the Chinese government should withdraw from housing  -except for providing a regulatory and legal framework for property rights, mortgage finance and urban planning - and restore consumer sovereignty to the urban dweller. Leased and individually owned property should be tradable. It said the link between work units and household housing choices must be broken. It recommended transferring control over existing housing allocation and maintenance from the danwei to an arms-length rental company which would receive rents which in the short-term cover maintenance and which, in the long-term, provide a commercial return on investment. The bank sketched a plan for the deregulation and marketisation of state-controlled urban housing, estimated at 1.6bn square metres of living space, over a five-year period. It envisaged a situation where subsidies are phased out, rents rose to a truer level and where pay was adjusted to compensated workers. Whether the Chinese government listens to this advice is moot. So far its attempts at reform have been peace meal and directed at finding the formula by which market rents can be mandated from Beijing. With a note of exasperation the bank noted: 'Too much time is being devoted to finding a scientific solution to a problem that defies science.' But time is one thing the authorities do not have. *China: Implementation Options for Urban Housing Reform, World Bank, January, 1992. 1818 H Street, NW, Washington, DC 20433, US</p>

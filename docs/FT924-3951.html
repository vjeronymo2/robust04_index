			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Improved margins lift Scottish Hydro to Pounds 40.6m SCOTTISH Hydro-Electric, the smaller of the two Scottish electricity companies, increased its pre-tax profit by two-thirds to Pounds 40.6m in the half year to September 30, thanks to higher volumes and better profit margins. Turnover of the integrated utility, which generates, transmits and distributes electricity, increased 6.8 per cent to Pounds 301m (Pounds 281.9m). Earnings rose 55 per cent to 7.93p and the interim dividend is being lifted by 10.8 per cent to 3.6p. Hydro-Electric's sales volume in Scotland showed underlying growth of 2 per cent, and there was a 20 per cent rise to Pounds 60.3m in sales to customers in England and Wales. The operating margin improved to 16.7 per cent, thanks partly to the arrival of 'sour' untreated gas from the Miller field in the North Sea at the company's Peterhead power station, and partly to the high Scottish summer rainfall, which permitted more hydro-electric generation. But these lower costs were partly offset by higher bills from Scottish Nuclear. Interest charges fell to Pounds 9.7m (Pounds 15.7m) as gearing was cut to 20.6 per cent through strong cashflow. It plans to redeem Pounds 116m of government debt, saving Pounds 1m in interest this year and Pounds 4m thereafter, although a redemption charge of Pounds 12.5m will appear in the full year's accounts. COMMENT Hydro-Electric has the second lowest tariffs in Britain and its sales in the English market will increase as the interconnector upgrade and Keadby come onstream. Like Scottish Power, it is better insulated than other power companies from the present energy review. If the government were to make consumers pay more for electricity to support the coal industry, Hydro-Electric would get higher income. If it tried to limit the pass-through to the consumer of the costs of gas plants like Keadby, the burden would fall on the regional generators, and Hydro-Electric is not a regional company. Analysts forecast full-year pre-tax profits of between Pounds 142m and Pounds 146m, and a full-year dividend of about 11.3p, compared with this year's 10.16p. The shares closed yesterday up 3p at 240p. With another 70p to be paid up next May, gross dividend yield on a fully paid basis is 4.8 per cent, reflecting the greater potential of the Scottish companies. The shares should be bought.</p>

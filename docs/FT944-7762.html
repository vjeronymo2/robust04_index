			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Revival of US airline boosts GPA GPA, the Irish aircraft leasing company rescued from collapse last year, returned to profit forthe six months ended September 30. The turnround was because of settlements received from the revived US airline America West, which recently emerged from bankruptcy. Pre-tax profits amounted to Dollars 5.3m (Pounds 3.23m), compared with a Dollars 39m loss, after the payment of Dollars 171m interest on its Dollars 5.13bn debt mountain. The figure was boosted by a Dollars 32m exceptional credit. A Dollars 57m loan to America West has been repaid, and the Dollars 32m credit related to the settlement of additional claims against aircraft leases to the airline. GPA's turnover rose from Dollars 800m to Dollars 1.07bn and the company had Dollars 832m positive cash flow from its operating activities. This included Dollars 525m from the sale of aircraft, partly through a previously agreed sales programme to GE Capital. Borrowings fell by Dollars 358m to Dollars 5.13bn; however, this compares with shareholders' funds of Dollars 192m. The company recently took on Morgan Stanley as adviser and is hoping to negotiate delayed repayment of Dollars 1.8bn of debt due in September 1996. GPA is aiming for an 11-month extension. Mr John Tierney, finance director, said: 'We believe the company has now stabilised in terms of trading. We are beginning to see improvements in the industry. We are now in a position to address the next major hurdle: the 1996 repayment.' He emphasised that with recent disposals GPA's liquidity was the strongest it had been for more than two years, and therefore the company would be able to negotiate 'without our backs to the wall'. Cash balances are Dollars 313m and available banking facilities are more than Dollars 100m. However, GPA admitted that the aircraft leasing market has not yet reflected the generally improved demand for air travel.</p>

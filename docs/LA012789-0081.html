			<p><P> January 27, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SMALL BUSINESS / JANE APPLEGATE: KNOW VALUE BEFORE YOU SELL COMPANY  </P> <P> After more than 20 years in the construction equipment business, Byron Romig  thought he wanted to sell his company. So three years ago, he paid an $18,500  fee to a firm to value his business and try to sell it.  </P> <P> The consultants interviewed employees, reviewed his financial statements and  produced a 50-page report on Anaheim-based Bymac Inc. Based on market research,  they suggested he set the price at $3.4 million. Although he felt the research  was somewhat superficial, Romig agreed to solicit offers.  </P> <P> "A small businessman has very few yardsticks to measure his business by," said  Romig, who once worked as a business broker himself.  </P> <P> Even if you don't plan to sell your business, it is important to know how to  fix a value on it. Figuring out what your business is worth requires a good  deal of digging, but experts say that the process will help you plan for growth  in the short term and a possible sale in the future.  </P> <P> "A valuation can be used for estate planning, to borrow money, to set up an  employee stock ownership plan, or if you think you might want to merge," said  Romig, who eventually decided not to sell his business and is now seeking  acquisitions with the hope of growing and going public.  </P> <P> Before calling in expensive consultants, Romig recommends that a small-business  owner first figure out what he thinks his company is worth.  </P> <P> A value can be calculated by reviewing past and present company financial  statements, reading industry reports and studying public information about  competitors. The value of equipment and supplies can be determined by  monitoring price lists and seeing how much used equipment sells for at  auctions, he said.  </P> <P> While a do-it-yourself approach may work in a specialized field such as the  selling and leasing of construction cranes and elevators, financial advisers  caution small-business owners against selling without some kind of professional  guidance. They say there are too many variables, including the emotional  attachment to a business built from scratch by an entrepreneur.  </P> <P> "Even when a company is teetering on the brink of insolvency, the owner thinks,  'It's my company and it has value,' " said Edmond Freiermuth, a Santa Monica  financial consultant who specializes in rescuing troubled companies. Freiermuth  said he is "constantly amazed at the difference in the value placed on a  business by the owner" compared to an outsider.  </P> <P> In most cases, small-business owners only consider selling when times are  tough, but Freiermuth said even the most content owner "can be persuaded to  sell if someone makes them an incredibly good offer."  </P> <P> So what if you decide that 1989 is the time to sell the business you have  lovingly nurtured from its inception?  </P> <P> "The first rule of thumb in appraising the value of a privately held company  is: Don't use rules of thumb," said John Johansen, an Arlington, Va., business  broker. "Each business has its own way of operating."  </P> <P> In a recent article in In Business magazine, Johansen suggests looking at four  important factors when attempting to value your business:  </P> <P> 1) Historical profits and future profit potential.  </P> <P> 2) General condition of the company, including facilities, staff, record  keeping, etc.  </P> <P> 3) Market demand and economic demand for the particular type of business.  </P> <P> 4) Ability to transfer the business's good will to a new owner.  </P> <P> Small-business owners can also find a wealth of practical information in a new  book co-authored by Lisa Berger, a Washington, D.C., journalist.  </P> <P> In "Cashing In, Getting the Most When You Sell Your Business," published by  Warner Books, Berger suggests "sprucing up" your business long before you talk  to a buyer.  </P> <P> "Get your financials and your building in shape," said Berger. "Start holding  on to some of your earnings rather than paying for salaries or perks."  </P> <P> She said a marginally profitable small business operated mainly to provide its  owner with a nice life style will not appear attractive to an outsider.  </P> <P> Although the book provides a glossary of terms, excellent tips on negotiating  and sample contracts, Berger strongly recommends hiring professional help.  </P> <P> "Don't try to do it by yourself," she said. "Some business owners are not very  good negotiators."  </P> <P> If you want to sell a publicly held business, there are strict state and  federal requirements, such as providing fair value to shareholders. But setting  the actual price may be easier. Daily stock market quotes provide some  reflection of the market's perception of what the company is worth, according  to James M. Needham and K. Dunlop Scott, accountants working for Arthur Young  International.  </P> <P> "One of the most difficult steps for some sellers is actually putting the  company on the market," they write in their booklet, "M&amp;A Strategies."  </P> <P> "You must be bold enough to seize real opportunities to sell your business, yet  cautious enough so as not to make your company appear to be shopworn or damaged  merchandise."  </P> <P> Every seller needs a report or "selling memorandum" outlining what his business  is about and what it is worth. Needham and Scott recommend that the memorandum  include a confidentiality clause. Such a clause seeks written assurance from a  potential buyer that any information he learns about your business will not be  used to your company's detriment.  </P> <P> They also suggest keeping a low profile during negotiations to minimize anxiety  among suppliers, customers and employees. "A good rule of thumb is to announce  the sale of the company only after it is completed," Needham said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Starting at Home  </P> <P> "How to Start and Promote a Home-Based Business" is the subject of a Feb. 4  seminar at the College of the Canyons in Valencia. The course is taught by Beth  Smith, publisher of "Business Line," a newsletter devoted to home-based  business.  </P> <P> The cost is $28 for tuition, plus a $5 materials fee. Pre-registration is  required. For information contact: College of the Canyons, 26455 N. Rockwell  Canyon Road, Valencia. Phone: (805) 259-7800, ext. 421.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Learning to Manage  </P> <P> Managing your small business is the focus of a weekend course to be offered  Feb. 18 and 19 and March 18 and 19 by the University of Redlands Whitehead  Center for Lifelong Learning.  </P> <P> The two-unit, four-day course meets each day from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. at the  university.

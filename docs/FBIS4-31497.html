			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Sz.Sz."-signed interview with Ivan Peto, chairman of the </F> Alliance of Free Democrats; place and date not given: "A  Refusal Would Have Had Negative Consequences"]    [Text] According to our information, immediately after the  elections, many of the determining personalities of the Alliance  of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] were firmly opposed to forming a  coalition with the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP]. However,  during the intensive debates in the past few weeks, those who  are against rejecting the coalition offer have gradually gained  a majority. "The parliamentary consequences of the elections  cannot be confused with people's desires," [SZDSZ Chairman] Ivan  Peto told MAGYAR HIRLAP. We interviewed Peto on the reasons why  the Free Democrats had accepted the Socialists' request for  starting coalition talks.    [MAGYAR HIRLAP] The SZDSZ convention on 5 June decided in  favor of starting coalition talks, with a surprising majority  for many people. According to my information, a major role was  played in this by the fact that the party's prominent  representatives and leaders collectively supported this idea.    [Peto] The executive committee was generally united. Out of  the 11 members, only Gabriella Beki and Peter Tolgyessy voted  against starting the talks. Tolgyessy had not taken part in  drawing up the proposal that was submitted by the executive  committee to the national council and on which the convention  voted. He presented his alternative proposal at the convention.  Apart from this, the party's leaders were indeed united in the  view that we have to start talks with the MSZP.    [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Immediately after the second round of the  elections, you and Gabor Kuncze said that society had voted  against the coalition and in favor of a one-party socialist  government. Why did you change your views within a week?    [Peto] On the night of the elections, we indeed said that  society had voted against the coalition and had not sufficiently  supported our intentions directed at setting up a balanced  government. Later, we realized that the parliamentary  consequences of the elections cannot be confused with people's  desires. The public opinion poll results published last week  clearly prove that a significant section of the electors would  prefer a coalition government to a one-party government. The  other reason for the gradual change of our views was that we had  analyzed the consequences of a possible one-party government.  It became clear that our country's international image would be  different in the case of a coalition government than in the case  of a one-party government. Third, the entrepreneurs who regard  the SZDSZ's program as promising are expecting that we will try  to implement it, but this can only be done from a governmental  position.    We also had to take it into consideration that, in addition  to the voters of the MSZP and the SZDSZ, large groups of society  find it justified to create a balanced coalition government in  spite of the Socialists' absolute majority. Our decision was  also influenced by the fact that, unusual in parliamentary  democracies, the MSZP made a coalition offer to the SZDSZ  although it had an absolute majority. The rejection of this  request would have clearly had negative consequences for us.    [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Between the two rounds of the elections, the  SZDSZ's leaders emphasized that an absolute majority gained by  the Socialists would make the conditions for setting up a  coalition rather difficult. Does this mean that we can expect  very difficult talks?    [Peto] It is perfectly obvious that, from the point of view  of setting up a coalition, the situation is different when a  party has absolute, rather than only a relative, majority. In a  given situation, the MSZP can assert its will in Parliament on  its own, therefore, it is much more difficult to conduct  coalition talks under these circumstances. If the MSZP did not  have an absolute majority then we would have to face different  kinds of problems at the talks. In this case, the coalition  would be a condition for forming a government. However, we now  have a different situation because the Socialists would also be  able to govern without us.</p>

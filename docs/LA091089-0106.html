			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BRAVO FOR JUDGE  </P> <P> Bravo to L.A. Judge Tashima for holding Operation Rescue terrorists in contempt  of court, and for fining them $111,000 for illegally blockading clinics  ("Abortion Protesters Fined, Held in Contempt by Judge," Aug. 30).  </P> <P> He has sent a clear message to those who would disregard laws, special  injunctions, and the rights of others and then expect special treatment. San  Diego judges should continue to act in a similar manner against local  blockaders.  </P> <P> The San Diego woman who testified about her April 29 experience of having a  miscarriage sat in my car for over an hour while anti-choice Operation Rescue  demonstrators blocked her access to her doctor. She wasn't having an abortion  -- she was bleeding and fighting for her life.  </P> <P> Herein lies the hypocrisy of the anti-choice movement's tactics of blockading  clinics. They threaten the lives of patients not going to have abortions, as  well as those women who have made a decision to legally end their pregnancies.  </P> <P> In America, no group has the right to harass and terrify innocent people  engaged in legal activities. If these anti-abortion zealots want to live in a  religious dictatorship, they should leave the U. S. immediately.  </P> <P> SUSI BUENO  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

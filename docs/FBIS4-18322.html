			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["na" report: "Industry Considers Creation of 15 Million </F> Jobs by the Year 2000 an Illusion"]    [Text] Duesseldorf, 30 Mar -- In a joint statement, the  Federation of German Industry (BDI) and the Federation of German  Employers' Associations (BDA) said that the goal of creating at  least 15 million new jobs in Europe by the end of the century,  which the European Union [EU] Commission set down in its white  paper, "Growth, Competitiveness, Employment -- Challenges of the  President and Paths Into the 21st Century," is too ambitious  and, unfortunately, unrealistic.    The EU white paper gives mass unemployment in Europe as  being  17 million, about 11 percent of the working population. The  European Council followed the most important recommendations of  the white paper without automatically adopting all proposals.  It is primarily the business of the member countries to put  these guidelines into political practice. The proposal of a new  common loan financing for infrastructure networks was strictly  rejected in particular by Germany and Great Britain.    The two German top associations express the fear that  political pressure will increase and that it will be stepped up  at the national level if the specific measures planned by the EU  Commission and envisaged by the action plan of the European  Council are ineffective.  <H5>  Tax Burden on Lower Wage Groups </H5>   Industry set down its ideas regarding the strengthening of  Europe's competitiveness in a report by UNICE [Union of EC  Industries], the umbrella organization of the European industry  and employers' associations, published in December 1993.    The two top associations of German industry unanimously pay  tribute to the analysis of the reasons of high unemployment in  the EU, which the white paper undertakes. The EU white paper  distinguishes between economic, structural, and technological  unemployment, and explains that in the field of structural  unemployment the reason is often to be found in sociopoltically  influenced decisions, such as:     -  relatively high costs for  low-qualified work, which favor investments in  rationalization,    -  a lack of flexibility of the labor markets and  limitation of entrepreneurial flexibility regarding training,  labor law regulations, work contracts, social security, and  internal management organization.    The two top associations also expressed approval for the  statement by the Commission that in most member states the tax  burden is disproportionately large for the lower-wage groups and  that this burden is about 25 percent higher in the EU, compared  with Japan and the United States.    The basic political orientation of the white paper and the  global strategy, in particular the rejection of expenditure  programs and the commitment to the EU's openness to the outside,  to reducing labor costs, to promoting education and training,  and to establishing more flexibility on the labor markets and  regarding work time is welcomed by the top associations. Their  statement says that with this the Commission follows the view  that has long been advocated by industry, namely that Europe's  competitive weakness can be overcome only by eliminating its  structural reasons.    However, industry criticized that many proposals of the  white  paper put too great an emphasis on strengthening economic  demand, on levying new taxes, and, generally, on the role of the  state in abolishing unemployment. The recommendations of the  white paper focus on creating more employment, primarily with  the help of state measures, and not so much on improving the  competitiveness of European industry by reducing the costs for  the companies.    The economic associations miss proposals that are aimed at  improving the entrepreneurial framework conditions in the  interest of investments, growth, and employment. They criticize  the fact that, in contrast, there are recommendations that would  result in new burdens on the companies. They also criticize the  fact that the commitment to a multilateral trade system is  linked to conditions that can at least be interpreted in  different ways, and more or less veiled threats regarding a lack  of good behavior by trading partners in other fields of  politics, the environment, human rights, etc.    The medium-term strategy for growth, competitiveness, and  employment that has been developed by the Commission is aimed at  halving unemployment in Europe by the year 2000. This  corresponds to the creation of at least 15 million jobs. In  their statement, the two German top associations explain why the  frequent reference of the white paper to the employment increase  in the European Community during the second half of the 1980's  and the U.S. employment miracle is misleading.  <H5>  Against the Introduction of Environmental Taxes </H5>   The Commission gives the following priorities for  employment:     -  Education and training as well as life-long  learning;    -  Raising external and internal flexibility;    -  Stronger  decentralization and promotion of the individual's  initiative;    -  Reducing the relative costs of low-qualified  work;    -  Setting the course for a new employment policy; and    -  A  response to new needs.    The top associations primarily criticize the last three  items. They oppose the Commission's proposals to reduce taxes  and social security contributions for low-qualified employees by  30 to 40 percent. In the Commission's view, this could result  in an increase in the number of jobs by 2 percent in countries  with very high social security contributions. In the EU  Commission's view, losses in revenues could be compensated by  raising revenues in nother places -- in particular by  introducing a tax on carbon dioxide emissions or by "taxing  capital income at the source."    German industry doubts that such model calculations would  correspond to reality. However, they already criticize the  starting point of these considerations. Instead of paying  low-qualified work for what it is worth, indirect subsidies are  supposed to be provided via allowances for social security  contributions. This would not correspond to the principle of  equivalence in the insurance system.    The idea of shifting the tax burden from work to other  factors, in particular the environment, would not improve the  international competitiveness of European industry, either. The  cost-neutral introduction of environmental taxes with a  simultaneous reduction of labor cost would be a mock solution.  The guiding and financing effects of such a tax would  contradict each other, in the view of the economic associations.  For economic and ecological reasons they reject the  introduction of an energy tax on carbon dioxide emissions and  other environmental taxes.    In particular with a view to the latest increase in  petroleum  tax and the decided increase in taxes on income in the form of  the solidarity surcharge as of 1 January, there is no more  leeway in Germany for a further increase in the tax burden.  Losses in revenues, for instance in social security, must be  compensated rather by budget savings and a restructuring of  social services. The associations also reject a further taxing  of capital yield as a possibility to compensate for a reduction  of labor cost.    The associations criticize the Commission's proposals for a  new employment policy. They could be misunderstood as a right  to work and training. Furthermore, more intensive public labor  exchange will hardly have any effect, at least not in Germany.    The associations are skeptical about ideas to use new needs  for the so far allegedly undeveloped reserves of new employment  opportunities and reject these ideas. These considerations are  aiming at a new "social economy." Many recommendations are  dangerously close to establishing work subsidized by the state,  that is, a second labor market.  <H5>  Warning Against Social Economy </H5>   Instead, the top associations demand a policy to reduce  labor  costs with the following elements:     -  Raising the flexibility  of the labor market;    -  Reducing the ancillary wage costs,  including social security contributions;    -  More leeway in wage  contracts to differentiate wages and salaries;    -  Reducing minimum  wages; and    -  Making hiring easier and reducing costs for dismissal.    The EU's proposals for measures at the EU level focus on  infrastructure and information. The top associations say that  the Commission's proposal to establish efficient trans-European  networks, in particular in the field of transportation and  energy, is the correct priority. However, in the view of German  industry, planning, financing, and construction of  infrastructures should basically remain with the member states.  <H5>  List With 26 Large Projects </H5>   The commission has drawn up a list of 26 large projects that  require investments of ECU82 billion by 1999. During this  period, ECU13 billion will be used for energy networks. The  Commission estimates that the priority projects of the European  information structure will require ECU67 billion by 1999. To  finance these projects, the Commission suggests allocating ECU20  billion annually until 1999 from the EU budget and, at the same  time, suggests the introduction of a new way for the EU to  finance loans.    German industry calls this proposal particularly  problematic.  It says that financing the "infrastructure" offensive by raising  means on the capital market via EU loans or convertible bonds by  private or public project managers would result in a further  increase in the EU's debts, which must, in the end, be paid by  the member states. Furthermore, any source of income outside  the budget counteracts the stability criteria anchored in the  Maastricht Treaty. In addition, the associations expressed the  fear that this "financial innovation" could mean the beginning  of further expenditure programs financed by loans. In Europe's  very own interests, German industry rejects loan financing by  the EU. Above all, the expansion of telecommunications and  energy projects should be carried out primarily by private  investments. The associations call for giving private models  priority also in the transportation sector.</p>

One could hear in the North the sound of hammering by  People's Army soldiers participating in socialist construction,  while in the South gun roar and rifle shots of the puppet Army  mobilized in war exercises assail the ear.    Though a grave situation has been created on the Korean  peninsula owing to the United States' perfidious act of  reversing the agreed conclusions reached at the New York contact  between the DPRK and the United States, soldiers of the Korean  People's Army [KPA] are performing feats in socialist  construction, while fulfilling their duty for defence of the  country.    Now soldiers are engaged in building an express highway  connecting capital Pyongyang to Hyangsan situated in mid-North  area of Korea.    They have laid a roadbed stretching far more than one  hundred  kilometres and completed difficult and complex construction of a  good many structures such as bridges and tunnels.    Besides this project, they have taken upon themselves  several  major projects of the country.    Ever since the early 1980s, they have built the large- scale  West Sea barrage costing 4 billion dollars, the  Pyongyang-Kaesong express highway stretching several hundred  kilometres, the 800 km-long waterways on the west coast, the  streetcar rails in Pyongyang, the Thaechon power station, the  Changgwang health complex, the ice-rink, Kwangbok and Thongil  Streets, and other architectures of eternal value in all parts  of the country.    And, with the Army-people relations getting closer,  "Army-people fields," "Army-people reservoirs", "Army-people  bridges", etc. have been brought into being by the soldiers  across the country.    The Supreme Command of the Korean People's Army mobilized  soldiers in socialist construction on several occasions. More  than 150,000 soldiers were mobilized in it in 1986 and the Armed  Forces were cut by 100,000 men in 1987 to be sent to various  domains of the national economy.    But, the puppet Army in the area South of the Military  Demarcation Line is a tool mercilessly cracking down upon the  people's struggle calling for independence, democracy and  reunification. This was proved by the atrocious massacre  committed by the puppet Army in May, 1980 in suppressing the  Kwangju popular uprising. At that time, over 14,000 people were  crippled and more than 5,000 people were killed in cold blood.    The puppet Army, together with the U.S. Forces, stage war  exercises of various codenames such as "Team Spirit",  "Ssangryong", "Ulchi", "Hwarang" and "Foul Eagle", inflicting  damages upon the people. This year, too, the South Korean  puppet Army are staging almost everyday powder-reeking war  exercises in the sky, on the land and in the sea on the orders  of the master. These two quite different realities clearly show  who wants peace and who seeks a war.    The KPA is the defender of the motherland, builder of a  prosperous country and creator of happiness, while the South  Korean puppet Army is cannon fodder and a suppressive tool  against the people.</p>

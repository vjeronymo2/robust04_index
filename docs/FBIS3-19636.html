Meanwhile,  "strange" developments have been taking place two weeks before  the elections in that region; the contesting parties have  threatened each other several times. Undoubtedly, the most  interesting development is the fact that one of the political  parties, which had no foothold in southeastern Turkey until a  year ago, has become a potential winner. Furthermore, that party  has challenged the PKK! The unknown aspects of the strange  developments can be explained as follows:    Fikri Aksay, Nationalist Action Party [NAP] mayoral  candidate  for the Diyarbakir metropolis, has said: "No other party exists  to rival us here. All the other parties are only on the posters  on signboards. Most of them are under the PKK's influence. The  people do not trust the other parties. The Motherland Party's  candidate expressed his views on the television series known as  the 32d Day under PKK's influence. The people have been  intimidated by the PKK. The political parties in power do not  have any strength in this region. The PKK exists in this region  and so does the NAP, which is a pro-state party. I have not  been threatened. The PKK is unable to threaten me and my  colleagues. It does not dare to do so. We have intimidated the  PKK. We have informed the PKK militants that they are finished  and that they will no longer be able to roam the mountains  because we have arrived in the region."    Aksay is convinced that the idealist movement will achieve  success in the local elections, not only in Diyarbakir but also  in every part of southeastern Turkey, without any exception.  Aksay accused his rivals of following in the wake of the PKK  and said that the NAP is loyal to the state. Regarding the  effort made to end bloodshed in the region, he said that the NAP  is the most determined political party in that regard.    Of course, Aksay's views have brought up the question of  which "horse" the government will bet on in southeastern Turkey.  It is a fact that the government moved to convene the Religious  Council and underline the view that the "call for prayers cannot  be abandoned and the banner has to be kept hoisted" 70 years  after the establishment of the Republic in the country. It is  also a fact that the government allowed the Prosperity Party to  intensify its activities some time ago. It now seems that it  has moved to facilitate NAP's initiatives. Is all this an  indication that the effort to resolve the problems in  southeastern Turkey is only aimed at finding a "military  solution?"    NAP's Viewpoint: The NAP members are convinced that the  Prosperity Party has lost its strength in southeastern Turkey.  NAP Deputy Leader Riza Muftuoglu has said that the Prosperity  Party will only be an insignificant problem for the NAP because  the representatives of the Kurdish citizens in the region have  asked the party to help them. Muftuoglu claimed the following:  "We are being pressed by the Prosperity Party in various areas.  That party is ahead of the NAP in Mus. However, it is behind  our party in Bingol. It is losing its strength every day. We  could have all of that party's votes if the elections were to be  held a month later. We have received very favorable reports  from southeastern Turkey. The NAP stands to win the elections  in almost all the provinces in the region." [passage omitted]    It is true that Turkey is marking the religious festival at  the present time. However, is that a sufficient reason for the  people in southeastern Turkey to decide to embrace the NAP?  Ismet Imset, editor of the TURKISH DAILY NEWS replied to that  question as follows: The NAP is supported by only a small group  in southeastern Turkey. However, it stands a good chance of  winning the elections if the people comply with the PKK's ban  and boycott the voting.    Stressing that the NAP will take over the mayoralties in at  least two provinces, Imset warned that tensions will escalate in  that region if the NAP wins in areas in which the Hizbullah  groups are strong.    Imset also claimed that the NAP is supported by the police  organization, the special teams, and several local tribes. The  fact that Abdulkerim Tatar, who is the NAP mayoral candidate  from Sirnak, is a member of the renowned Tatar Tribe confirms  Imset's viewpoint. Tatar has claimed that the NAP is quickly  gaining strength in Sirnak and stressed that a move by the PKK  to direct pressure against him is out of the question. He also  claimed that the PKK threat in Sirnak has nearly disappeared and  urged journalists to visit the town to establish the true state  of affairs. [passage omitted]    The NAP members wholeheartedly trust their party and  believe that through its approach the most rational solutions  can be found to the problems in southeastern Turkey In fact,  they have ignored PKK threats and pressures and seem to have  declared a "state of emergency" and "mobilization" for  themselves in that region. The NAP mayoral candidate  unconditionally support the concept of a "military solution" and  maintain the view that the Kurds and the Turks are brothers but  terrorists must be given a deserved lesson. Hamza Ugurlu, NAP  mayoral candidate in Bitlis, has said that the PKK is an enemy  of the Kurds and Turks, who have lived like brothers for many  centuries. He described the PKK as a dirty organization that  has contaminated the region. [passage omitted]    Conditions in the region have made the NAP's grass roots  adopt a radical approach. The NAP members have even ignored the  murder of the head of the party organization in Genc district  some time ago. Ismet Imset and several other observers have  warned that tensions will escalate if the NAP mayoral candidate  win the elections in the region. They have also claimed that  the NAP receives significant support from a number of mechanisms  in the state's structure. However, Riza Muftuoglu has refuted  that viewpoint and noted that the NAP is supported by the people  and not by certain mechanisms in the state's structure.  Asserting that the success the NAP will achieve in southeastern  Turkey will be a turning point for the country, Muftuoglu argued  that certain forces, which wish to obstruct the establishment of  tranquillity, are trying to mislead the people on the views of  several NAP candidates. [passage omitted]    When the situation of the idealists in southeastern Turkey  is  viewed, the Great Unity Party [GUP], which was established by a  group that splintered from the NAP, also has to be considered.  Opposed to NAP's support for a radical pro-Turkish and pro-state  military solution to the problem in southeastern Turkey, the  party will contest the elections in all the provinces in the  region, supporting the concept of "the establishment of a  civilian community and Islamic brotherhood." The GUP is  regarded as the favored political party in several areas.    The GUP mayoral candidate in Mus, Sirnak, Bitlis, and  Adiyaman are confident that they will win the elections.  Compared with NAP mayoral candidates, their approach is not as  inflexible and radical. They have said that they have been  threatened by the PKK, as have the mayoral candidates of other  political parties. However, they stressed that they have  ignored the threats. The GUP mayoral candidates are convinced  that bloodshed can be avoided with an honest administration and  forbearance. [passage omitted]    GUP's Viewpoint: GUP leader Muhsin Yazicioglu has said that  his party is confident that it will achieve success in the  elections in southeastern Turkey and win in Sirnak in  particular. He also said that his party will benefit from  Islam's uniting nature and try to resolve the PKK problem in the  region.    The fact that the NAP and GUP have gained strength in  southeastern Turkey indicates that balances will change after  the local elections on 27 March. The NAP's extreme pro-state  and pro-Turkish views, the NAP leader's claim that his party  will resolve the PKK problem in southeastern Turkey in six  months, and the claims that the NAP is supported by the village  guards and state mechanisms have clarified the approach the  government has adopted on the Kurdish problem. Nevertheless,  the fact that two former NAP mayors, who held office in Bingol  prior to the military takeover on 12 September 1980, have been  killed has led observers to ask the following: How will the  people in southeastern Turkey react to a possible NAP victory in  the elections? How will the NAP emerge from the elections in  the region? Will bloodshed end if the NAP wins? Will the NAP  become an official side in the clash between the state forces  and the PKK? Will the PKK use NAP's radical approach to gain  advantages in international platforms? The outcome of the  elections on 27 March will clarify these questions.</p>

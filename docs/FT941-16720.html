			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Leading Article: A souffle for sophisticates A western pension fund manager with money invested in Karachi or Istanbul would no doubt have been delighted this week to see that equities in both markets hit all-time highs. The pleasure would, however, have been qualified if the same manager held shares in Hong Kong, where on Thursday the stock exchange registered its biggest one-day fall since the 1987 crash. Depression would have set in with Malaysian equities, since the Kuala Lumpur exchange simultaneously saw the biggest ever decline in a single day. Given that such manic behaviour is the norm for emerging markets, any member of a pension scheme might reasonably ask whether a claim on earnings and assets in these developing economies is really going to do much for his or her retirement income. At a theoretical level, the answer is encouraging. One of the advantages of the global equity market that has emerged since the liberalisation of exchange controls in the 1980s is that it enables countries to seek international solutions to a wider range of domestic economic problems. A particularly difficult problem faced by most developed countries arises from demography. Mature economies with ageing populations tend to generate excess savings in relation to the available profitable investment opportunities. This can lead to large current account surpluses, since the balance of payments is the mirror image of the balance (or imbalance) of savings and investment. In an economy ring-fenced by exchange controls, pension fund money is largely trapped. Meanwhile, excess saving puts a brake on growth unless its deflationary impact is matched by dis-saving in the public sector. Yet public sector dis-saving leads to an absurd situation in which first-world countries run into the red on current account and have to suck capital out of the third world to finance their deficits. Ageing population Take away the exchange controls and it becomes easy to export excess savings in the form of equity capital to countries where populations are younger, savings lower and investment opportunities greater. This is a positive sum game, in which the contribution of western capital to economic growth in the third world, and the resulting return to the first world, make it easier to cope with the pressure of ageing populations. Meantime third-world countries enjoy more flexible access to capital, in that equity dividends, unlike debt interest, are not fixed. The micro arguments for investment in emerging markets are equally strong. Portfolio theory has established an overwhelming case that diversification increases investment returns for a given degree of risk. Diversification into emerging markets offers particularly big benefits because these markets have a low correlation with international market movements. And there is a big benefit to companies in the third world in the shape of a much reduced cost of capital. Practical limitations This pleasing theoretical symmetry unfortunately has practical limitations. For the complementarity of savings and investment patterns across the globe is inadequately reflected in the structure of financial markets. Underdeveloped capital markets in Asia, Latin America and elsewhere simply cannot generate assets on a scale to match more than a tiny fraction of the liabilities of the first-world financial system. Much third-world financing, especially among the expatriate Chinese, is done through family contacts; and oriental families are notoriously more keen to speculate in other people's shares than to cede control of their own businesses. Hence the fad that has sent prices sky-high over Christmas and the new year. A wall of institutional money has collided with a very rickety emerging market infrastructure. What has to be remembered is that such markets are usually under-regulated and plagued by insider dealing. Equity shares may confer no worthwhile voting rights and be subject to a variety of government restrictions. Company disclosure can be threadbare and accounting haphazard. Liquidity often proves illusory, which is why fund managers who think they have the Midas touch in Karachi should think again. It was the foreigners who propelled the market to its peak, and their judgment will look rather different when they propel the market back to the depths on their way to the exit. Yet the caveats should not be overdone. Emerging markets may be as frothy as a souffle, and as prone to fall. But Britain, the US and Japan started like that too. The first rule of this high-risk game is that investors should spread their risks and keep their exposure to a modest percentage of their portfolio. The second is that they should avoid buying in a bubble, which is where we are now. There are crashes aplenty in emerging markets and they constitute that rare thing: a clearly identifiable buying signal. Wait for the wailing and gnashing of teeth in those economies where longer-term growth prospects look assured.</p>

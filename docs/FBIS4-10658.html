			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Roberto Cavada -- recorded] </F>   [Text] On 14 April, Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina  addressed the Foreign Relations Committee of the Argentine  Chamber of Deputies, where he again found a receptive audience  when speaking of Cuba's reality. The meeting included those who  adhere to campaigns to discredit Cuba on the basis of highly  manipulated and politicized issues. In this regard, Robaina  stressed that Cuba is willing to listen to any idea or opinion,  but that it cannot allow anyone to decide Cuba's destiny and  future, for this lies only in the hands of the Cuban people.    The issue of the Cuban debt to Argentina, estimated at $1  billion, was also discussed during Robaina's meeting with Carlos  Sanchez, first vice economic minister [name and title as heard],  and a large group of businessmen from various sectors. Regarding  Cuba's debt, Robaina stressed that Cuba does not currently have  the money or enough products with which to pay its debt.  However, Cuba does not intend to pay its debt to Argentina or  any other country by making an issue of it. Robaina added that  Cuba believes the profits from foreign investments in sectors  that generate exports is one way to pay the debt. He added that  Cuba truly wishes to repay its debt and to create a climate in  which to bilaterally take things one step at a time and with  both feet firmly planted on the ground.    Robaina's agenda also included a meeting with former  President Raul Alfonsin, and friends of Cuba who met to express  their support and solidarity with the Cuban people.</p>

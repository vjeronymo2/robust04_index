			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] In its 7 April survey of Slovene parties  titled "Three Slovene-Two Parties" DNEVNIK contends that the  reason for the plethora of political parties and associations --  124 are currently registered in Slovenia -- is that only 20  signatures are required to register a new party. The Ljubljana  daily predicts, however, that the number of parties will be  "drastically reduced" by a new law that, if adopted in its  present form, will include the requirement that "at least 500  adult Slovene citizens must sign charter statements and adopt a  party statute and program" to form a party. The paper notes that  this will not be an obstacle for the seven parties that have  deputies in parliament, but will "probably be quite a hardship"  for smaller parties with only a few hundred members.    The DNEVNIK article contains a "survey" of political  parties,  including information on their membership, organization, and  dues. The paper observes that while none of the parties possess  precise membership figures, all of them boast that their ranks  are swelling.    The largest political party, according to DNEVNIK, is the  Slovene People's Party (SLS), whose chairman is Marjan Podobnik,  with 36,000 members organized in 51 county (opstina) committees.  SLS Secretary Franc Feltrin claims that membership is growing,  "especially in urban areas." Party dues are 1,000 tolars a year.  The party rules do not bar membership in other political  parties, except for members of the SLS leadership, and place no  restrictions on admission.    DNEVNIK lists as the second largest political party the  Slovene Christian Democrats (SKI), whose chairman is Lojze  Peterle, with about 35,000 members, 20 percent of whom are also  members of other parties. Members must be "adult Slovene  citizens who accept the SDK statute and program." Among SDK  members, however, are about 1,200 Slovenes who live abroad and  are "not necessarily Slovene citizens." The party has 356 town,  62 county, and 16 regional committees. A new member has to sign  a special admission form and pay dues based on income.    The United List of Social Democrats (ZLSD), whose chairman  is  Janez Kocijancic, has 23,000 dues-paying members and about  10,000 "sympathizers" who pay their dues irregularly, according  to its secretary, Dusan Kumer. Dues are 1 percent of a member's  net personal income or "as much as he or she can afford." The  ZLSD averages seven town committees in each county (there are  presently 62 counties in Slovenia) and has 13 regional  committees. Several associations such as the Women's Forum, the  Youth Forum, the Retirees Association, and the Workers  Association are also included in the ZLSD. The new united  Liberal Democracy of Slovenia (LDS), whose chairman is Janez  Drnovsek, has 18,000 members, says its secretary, Andrej Novak.  Formed on 12 March by a merger of four "left-of-center" parties,  the LDS has "at least" one party committee in each county in  addition to town committees. LDS members are not allowed to  belong to other parties. Following the merger, it is expected  that committees will be reorganized and the annual dues of 3,600  tolars reduced. Party officials pay dues of up to 2 percent of  their monthly gross incomes.    Branko Grims, secretary of the Social Democratic Party  (SDSS), whose chairman is Janez Jansa, says that the party's  membership has increased almost 10 percent due to the "recent  political events"--Jansa's dismissal from the post of defense  minister and the party's subsequent departure from the governing  coalition. The party has about 6,000 members, mostly  "nonagricultural workers." Membership in other parties is not  allowed. The SDSS has committees in every county; it is  "particularly strong" in Murska Sobota, Ljubljana, and Maribor.  Annual dues are 1,000 tolars.    The Slovene National Party (SNS), whose chairman is Zmago  Jelincic, has more than 4,000 members. The SNS statute  stipulates that to become a member of the party "one has to be a  Slovene and a Slovene citizen, must feel like a Slovene, must  agree with the SNS statute, and not have been a member of the  League of Communists of Slovenia or Yugoslavia." The last  requirement can be waived by the SNS Presidency, according to  DNEVNIK. Membership in other parties is not allowed. The monthly  dues are to 200 tolars for persons who are employed; the  unemployed, retirees, and students pay 50 tolars a month.    The Slovene National Right (SND), whose chairman is Saso  Lapa, has about 1,000 card-carrying members organized in five  provincial committees; each provincial committee is composed of  eight regional committees. According to Saso Lapa, there are six  requirements for becoming an SND member: "One must be a Slovene,  behave like a Slovene, feel like a Slovene, and accept our  culture, traditions, and rules of the game." One must never have  belonged to the Communist Party or the League of Communists and  never held an office in the Socialist Alliance or Socialist  Youth League. Party dues are 100 tolars per month.    DNEVNIK lists three additional minor parties which do not  have seats in parliament: the Freedom Party with 500 members,  the Forward Workers Party in Idrija with 100 members, and the  Slovene Christian Socialists with 150 members. They are  preparing to merge into a "new, left-oriented Social Democratic  Party."</p>

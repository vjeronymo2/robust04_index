			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Survey of Computers and Communications (6): ATM changes the rules - Local Area Networks The growth of computer networks in the past decade has pushed communications technology to its limit. As companies connect increasing numbers of personal computers and workstations to their enterprise-wide networks, the limitations of the first wave of local area network (LAN) technology have become evident. In addition, companies now see LANs as more than just a way to connect conventional computers together. They see the potential of multimedia networks and the applications opportunities they offer. Consequently, they want to use the same network to carry voice traffic and, looking to the future, they want to be able to use it for video and images too. The combination of these different forms of traffic and the increased volume of digital data they generate means that existing networking technology is inadequate. Fortunately a new technology, which can meet the demands of future networks, has emerged from the international telecommunications sector: Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) promises to overcome the limitations of current networking technology and, more importantly, to bring a common form to networking traffic regardless of its content. Larger companies are starting to plan for ATM technology and it has backing from a broad range of computer and communications suppliers: 'ATM technology offers a different way to build networks and will change the whole networking industry,' says Ms Bobbi Murphy, vice-president of marketing for Hughes LAN Systems, the communications subsidiary of Hughes Aircraft. Hughes LAN is one of the first communications suppliers to come to market with ATM products. Ms Murphy says existing LAN technology is limited in 'bandwidth', a measure of the amount of data which can be carried on a communications line. 'If you put more users on the network you run into performance problems because of the small band width. And it is made worse by the way that LAN technology works,' she says. Most LANs us either Ethernet technology or 'token-ring' technology. In both cases, data is sent around the network in variable length 'packets' - a method which incurs processing overheads. Furthermore, a number of different network formats or protocols has grown up over the past decade and, when a company wants to connect two different types of LAN together, data must be translated from one format to the other. When LANs are connected to external wide area networks (WAN), further translation or 'protocol conversion' is usually needed. ATM technology aims to solve many of these problems. Like current LAN technology, it also uses 'packets' to carry data. But it avoids many of the problems by using a fixed-size packet. Each ATM packet - known as a 'cell' - contains only 53 bytes of data, including five which are used for addressing and routing the data through the network. This has a number of advantages - the most important being that the cells can be handled by hardware, thus speeding up the network. The speed of transmission is crucial when carrying the voice and video signals over the network. Current LAN technology operates at a maximum transmission rate of 10 megabits a second and has the potential to handle much higher rates. Mr David Drury, European general manager for US supplier Fore Systems, sees the scalability of ATM technology as one of its main virtues: 'There is a hierarchy of speeds possible with ATM from 155 megabits up to 2.4 gigabits. 'If you run out of bandwidth between points in the network - you don't have to throw it all out - you can upgrade those parts of the network where higher speeds are needed,' he says. 'It is the first time you will have all communications in a single media format. It is not just a 'go-faster' technology - it enables new applications.' Fore Systems began delivering ATM compatible networking products in May and sees it as an important growth area. Like Hughes LAN, Fore Systems sees the main demand for products which can help the transition from current LAN technology to ATM. 'We can provide products which can link to current technology like Novell's Netware,' says Mr Drury. A big advantage of ATM is that the large telecommunications suppliers - including AT&amp;T and MCI in the USA and British Telecom in the UK - are committed to move to the technology for their long-haul networks. Once in place, all types of data can be moved from source to destination without the need for conversion. 'It will probably be 1995 before the wider ATM infrastructure starts to slot into space. But there are opportunities now for companies to use it for high-speed LANs,' says Mr Drury. The UK could be in the forefront of the move to ATM technology. Plans have been approved by the UK government to upgrade the Janet network, which links UK universities and research institutes, to ATM technology. The new network will be known as SuperJanet and will use ATM technology to link 200 sites across the UK. 'We aim to offer much higher performance and provide a multi-service network to handle voice, data and multimedia,' says Dr Robert Cooper, director of networking for the UK universities and national research institutes. 'We are moving more towards image-based communications and this will open up all kinds of new applications.' Dr Cooper says education and medical applications in particular will benefit from the faster speeds and greater bandwidth offered by ATM. A pilot application to link six UK sites with ATM is scheduled to start in March 1993. It seems likely that this will be the first of many moves towards ATM technology for future networking needs.</p>

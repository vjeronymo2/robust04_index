The  exclusive right to publish the interview was granted the  ASSA-Irada Agency.    [Akhundova] Esteemed speaker, did it come as a surprise to  you that Geydar Aliyev, president of Azerbaijan, offered you the  position of head of parliament and did you personally have any  doubts as to whether you should accept this offer or not?    [Kuliyev] Of course, I could not make so responsible a  decision on the spot. I had spoken with the president on this  subject on more than one occasion and had weighed all the pros  and cons. And I ultimately agreed because I am accustomed to  independent work, I am accustomed to adopting responsible  decisions, for which I myself have to answer first and foremost.  I hope that in this office I will have more opportunities to  influence a change in the course of events in the republic for  the better. It was with this in mind that I agreed to let my  name go forward.    [Akhundova] It is said that your confirmation was preceded  by  quite a tumultuous discussion and that not all members of the  Milli Majlis accepted your candidacy without question. This is  shown by the results of the voting also: 38 in favor, six  against. Your opponents voiced misgivings as to whether you had  sufficient diplomatic, political, and, finally, legal experience  and knowledge to lead parliament--after all, you have hitherto  been involved mainly in industry and economic activity. How  would you respond to your opponents?    [Kuliyev] As though all our previous speakers had attended a  school of diplomacy or had been professional politicians. As far  as I am concerned, as director of the republic's biggest oil  refinery and then vice premier in charge of the oil sector, I  repeatedly took part in negotiations and in the elaboration of  agreements with leading overseas companies. And would, what is  more, frequently get into legal niceties which some members of  parliament have not even dreamed of. In addition, I have been a  member of parliament for about three years and have in this  capacity on a par with everyone taken part in the preparation  and adoption of several dozen laws regulating at the present  time the most varied spheres of our society's political and  economic life. As far as the lack of theoretical knowledge is  concerned, first, this assertion does not correspond to reality  either and, second, many at first sight fine and necessary laws  have been adopted in parliament here in recent years which,  however, have not worked, virtually, remaining to a large extent  on paper only. And all because the people at the helm of  administration of the state have not known how to make them  work, how to put them into practice. It seems to me, therefore,  that the experience of business leader, hands-on knowledge in  the sphere of enterprise, and a precise vision of how the  economy should be reformed and in which direction will help me  make the right decisions.    [Akhundova] The opposition's main demand is for early  parliamentary elections, for the present parliament, in the  opinion of the opposition parties and movements, is conclusively  discredited. Your opinion on this score? How do you view this  parliament, with which you will have to work?    [Kuliyev] You know, I do not believe that this parliament is  as bad as the opposition says. This demand--for early  parliamentary elections--incidentally, was made before also, at  the time of rule of the Elchibey regime. However, both Isa  Gambar, former chairman of parliament, and other leaders were in  no hurry to dissolve parliament, preferring to work with the  "illegitimate," as they put it, Milli Majlis, for whose creation  they had expended so much effort. I personally believe that our  parliament has matured considerably on the professional level.  It has performed a great deal of law-making work, and it is not,  I repeat, its fault that the laws it has adopted have not  worked. As was the president and his style of work, so also was  parliament. I am sure that we can and should work with the  present parliament through the end of its term. Not violating  the constitution and not resorting to forcible measures.    [Akhundova] What will be for you the priority in the office  of speaker of parliament?    [Kuliyev] The main thing in the economy today is to open the  way to truly market relations and to give honest enterprise  freedom in order to chop off at the root the causes of  bribe-taking and corruption demoralizing our society. And the  main thing in social and political life is to put an end as  quickly as possible to the enervating, bloody war. I will work  in this direction. All members of parliament also should step up  their activity in this direction.    [Akhundova] And what do you prefer--a continuation of the  negotiating process with the Armenian side or tougher, power  measures?    [Kuliyev] Political dialogue and peace negotiations under  the  aegis of the international organizations should, of course,  continue. At the same time I am for the creation of a strong  professional army, which could serve as a dependable guarantor  of the state independence and territorial integrity of our  republic.</p>

			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Observer: Whipping boy Watch out for John Prescott, who may shortly be enjoying a bit of extra influence in Tony Blair's new-look Labour party. Derek Foster, the opposition party's current chief whip, has been in situ for nine years, during which time he has seen off some tough contenders for his post. But he could finally have met his match in Richard Caborn, one of the pugnacious deputy leader's closest political allies who has emerged as a challenger for what is the party's most important Mr Fixit job. Caborn, who ran Prescott's successful campaign for the deputy leadership earlier this year, belongs to Labour's 'traditionalist' faction. He has made a considerable impression in the past two years as a strong chairman of the Commons trade and industry committee, presiding over inquiries into political hot potatoes such as the coal industry and the future of the Post Office. Blair, whose Sedgefield constituency is in Foster's neck of the woods, has in effect backed the incumbent by indicating that he does not favour a contest. But, with at least two more runners expected to surface before nominations close next month, the race is shaping into a far more interesting contest than the tepid campaign leading to Blair's runaway victory in July.</p>

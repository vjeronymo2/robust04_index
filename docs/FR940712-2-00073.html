Warren, M.D.; Revocation of Registration</DOCTITLE> <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On October 5, 1992, the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), issued an Order to Show Cause to Steven E. Warren, M.D. (Respondent), of Salt Lake City, Utah, proposing to revoke his DEA Certificate of Registration, AW1662609, and to deny any pending applications for registration as a practitioner. The Order to Show Cause alleged that Respondent's continued registration would be inconsistent with the public interest as that term is used in 21 U.S.C. 823(f) and 824(a)(4), in that the Respondent was personally abusing narcotic controlled substances and obscured this use from others; that Respondent misused his registration privilege to obtain Schedule II controlled substances for other than legitimate medical purposes; that Respondent failed to maintain complete and accurate controlled substance records; that Respondent failed to account for 40 to 50 multi-dose vials of Demerol; that Respondent added saline solution to a commercial vial of Demerol in an effort to mislead investigators; and that Respondent distributed controlled substance samples without a legitimate medical purpose. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, citing his preliminary finding that Respondent's continued registration posed an imminent danger to the public health and safety, the Administrator ordered the immediate suspension of DEA Certificate of Registration, AW1662609, during the pendency of these proceedings. 21 U.S.C. 824(d). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Respondent, by counsel, responded to the Order to Show Cause and requested a hearing. The matter was docketed before Administrative Law Judge Paul A. Tenney. A hearing was held in Salt Lake City, Utah on July 28, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On October 6, 1993, the administrative law judge issued his findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommended ruling in which he recommended,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> iner alia, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  that the Respondent's DEA registration be revoked and that any pending applications be denied. The administrative law judge also recommended that the Administrator grant the Respondent alternative relief in the form of a waiver of DEA regulations to permit the San Juan County Hospital to employ Respondent and permit him to order controlled substances for hospital patients. The Government filed exceptions to this recommendation, and the Respondent filed a response to the Government's exceptions. The administrative law judge transmitted the record to the Acting Administrator on November 8, 1993. The Deputy Administrator has considered the record in its entirety and, pursuant to 21 CFR 1316.67, enters his final order in this matter, based on findings of fact and conclusions of law as hereinafter set forth. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The administrative law judge found that the Respondent graduated from medical school with the assistance of a National Service Corps scholarship, and was subsequently assigned to a remote county in Utah to complete his four year obligation to the Federal Government. After completion of his obligation, Respondent continued to practice in the area. For a period of approximately two years, Respondent was the only physician in the county. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1991 and 1992, Utah State licensing authorities initiated an investigation into the Respondent's prescribing practices by conducting audits of two local pharmacies. No violations were found. However, in June 1992, after anonymous complaints that the Respondent was receiving injections during his medical practice, the state initiated a new investigation and determined that the Respondent was unable to account for quantities of Demerol, a Schedule II narcotic controlled substance. Additionally, investigators determined that improper transfers of Demerol from the local hospital to the Respondent's medical office had been made. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the DEA administrative hearing, Respondent testified that he had started self-administering Demerol for shoulder pain and migraine headaches after a fall off the roof of his home. Subsequently, the Respondent was exposed to a contaminated needle in the course of his practice, became ill, and was admitted to a hospital for several days. There, he discussed his addiction with physicians, who arranged his admission to a five-week rehabilitative program. The Respondent surrendered his state controlled substance license in October 1992. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

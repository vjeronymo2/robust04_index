			<p>BFN     [Text] Shijiazhuang, March 23 (XINHUA) -- Baiyangdian, the  biggest inland lake in north China, will shine brighter as the  local government has stepped up its effort to protect the `Pearl  of North China' from pollution.    Oxygen-consuming waste water discharged into the lake has  dropped by some 40 percent in the past year, according to  environmental protection officials from Baoding city, a dozen km  from the lake in Hebei Province.    A working group set up in 1992 and headed by the mayor of  the  city is now responsible for controlling the flow of pollutants  into the lake.    A sewage treatment plant that can use coal dust from a  thermal power plant to recycle 50,000 tons of waste water  discharged by a paper mill has recently been put into operation  by the lakeside. The five-million-yuan plant is a model project  supervised by the State Environmental Protection Agency.    Another two waste water treatment plants financed by the  central and local governments and through a Finnish Government  loan are now under construction. Each will be able to treat  80,000 tons of waste water a day.    In 1992, a paper mill and a chemical plant were closed down  by the city government to reduce waste discharges into the lake.    Since 1990, factories in the area have had to pass  environmental assessments by the government before being allowed  to discharge waste into the lake. So far 45 factories have been  licensed, according to the officials.</p>

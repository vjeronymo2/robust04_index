			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Labour aims to stop ITV takeovers MS ANN CLWYD, shadow national heritage secretary, yesterday published a proposed bill to prevent takeovers of ITV companies until 1996. She argued that unless urgent action was taken 'we could eventually see the existing 14 ITV companies reduced to just three or four'. The single section bill to amend the 1990 Broadcasting Act has no official status although Ms Clwyd said yesterday she hoped it would become a private members' bill. The government is under considerable pressure from some of the larger ITV companies to make takeovers easier. They believe that reform of the ITV structure is both necessary and inevitable. Medium-sized companies which do not want to be taken over argue the importance of regional independence. At the moment the nine largest companies are forbidden from taking each other over. Until next year there are also obstacles that make it difficult for anyone to take over ITV companies. Ms Clwyd wants to see an extension of the 'moratorium' on takeovers. The government has yet to decide whether the ownership rules should be changed or whether there should be a moratorium until 1996. Mr John Major, the prime minister, will next month chair a ministerial meeting on the issue.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe by </F> correspondent Patrick Poivre d'Arvor -- live]    [Text] [d'Arvor] Good evening Alain Juppe. This question  that Bill Clinton seems to raise [quoting the correspondent in  the video report on Clinton wondering whether France is really  committed to air strikes in Bosnia], I will put it to you again:  Are the French ready?    [Juppe] I already answered this question on Sunday [6  February] afternoon in the company of Francois Leotard [minister  of state for defense], when I said that France wanted an  ultimatum to be given in order to obtain the lifting of the  siege in Sarajevo. When one says ultimatum, one says force must  be used if conditions are not met. So we are ready. I would  like to add a word: When I say this, I say it with all the  seriousness it implies. I hear a lot of advice these days. We  are told we should hit back, we should be firm. I do not  believe I have been suspected of being weak since the start of  the tragedy in the former Yugoslavia. Striking means putting  the population and our soldiers at risk. As you can understand,  a member of the government, like any French citizen, thinks  first about our soldiers. In life, there are those with  positions of responsibility and those who exhort. Exhorting is  easy, deciding is more difficult. We are ready to decide.    [d'Arvor] For the moment things have not been that easy,  first, vis-a-vis your European allies, as they have been slow to  respond. The word ultimatum was not used yesterday, will it be  used tomorrow perhaps?    [Juppe] No ultimatum was given but a demand for the lifting  of the siege on Sarajevo was made. It was affirmed that all  means should be used, including air strikes. Therefore, I think  the decision of the Twelve -- even if we had to work hard with  those who were more reluctant -- goes in the right direction.  Tomorrow, during the meeting of the Atlantic Council, you  mentioned a short while ago that France's position will be very  clear. We will ask for a precise and strong reaction. We  cannot let last Sunday's massacre in Sarajevo go by without  reacting clearly and strongly.    [d'Arvor] So a fresh incident is not expected?    [Juppe] Surely not. If tomorrow, the Council of the Atlantic  Alliance does not agree or if it only embarks on a fresh  exercise in exhortation, saying: Watch it! You will see what  we will do next time! France will not be associated with such a  decision.    [d'Arvor] So this means it [France] will eventually decide  on  its own on the air strikes?    [Juppe] Obviously not. We neither have the law [on our side]  nor the strength. But we will not continue [subscribing] to  this situation -- to which, I hope, I will go back to in a  moment -- we will not continue to put the lives of our soldiers  and their reputation in danger. They are being criticized at  the moment. It is said that because they are in Sarajevo,  strikes are not possible. This situation would be unbearable if  it were to continue. This is not likely -- as I said earlier,  why?    We have done a lot of work with our allies, in particular  with the Americans, and I think that tomorrow morning we will be  able to present a joint position to the Council of the Alliance,  in particular between the United States and France, which would  demand the lifting of the siege. It would mean specifically:  The withdrawal of the attacking, or besieging troops to a  distance of 20-30 km, so that they cannot repeat what they have  done, wherever the firing came from, that they cannot repeat  what we saw in those terrible, unbearable, pictures.    Then we will demand that all heavy arms in this area be  placed under United Nations control, and we will say very  clearly -- or at least this is what we will propose -- that if  these demands are not satisfied within a few days, the batteries  remaining in the zone will be the object of air strikes.    I think that is a very clear position, and I repeat the  answer I gave you just now: France is ready to face up to the  risks. The president, the prime minister, the minister of  defense, and I myself have held discussions, and this decision  has been taken.    [d'Arvor] If you are speaking of Franco-American decisions,  or at least of a Franco-American axis, this means that you  already have some indications from the White House that lead you  to believe....    [Juppe, interrupting] Of course. You know, all these things  are serious, as I said just now, at the beginning. So, we would  not do it just like that, all alone. For the past several days  I have had daily conversations with our European and American  partners.    I would like to add one thing: It seems to me that  Washington has adopted the French position on the reaction to be  taken on the latest massacres in Sarajevo, but it also seems to  me that there is an evolution on the political and diplomatic  level, because -- I would like to add this point as it seems  very important to me -- we are not warmongers, we are not trying  to conduct an all-out war; we want to launch an ultimatum, but  we also want a political perspective in all this. We recall  that there is a plan for a political settlement, and that there  is no other way out than by political negotiation. It seems --  and this is another positive aspect of my conversations this  afternoon -- that the Americans are ready to associate  themselves with this diplomatic and political step by the  Europeans. Our plan is not unalterable; it can be developed, it  can be improved, but I make this appeal once again: All the  great powers, the Americans, but also the Russians and the  Europeans, must tell the belligerents: We will not allow the  massacres in Sarajevo to continue but, at the same time, we are  proposing a way our for you, and it is a political and  diplomatic way.    [d'Arvor] If I understand you right, the two prongs of the  alternative are, if you do not get satisfaction in Brussels  tomorrow from your NATO partners, that means that the French are  ready to withdraw, since they will be alone against the  attackers and belligerents of all kinds?    [Juppe] I think tomorrow it will be a question of dignity  and  honor. How, after having so often uttered threats, so often  repeated that we will not allow such massacres to happen again,  can we do nothing?    France will not associate itself with a nondecision. If the  Atlantic alliance is incapable of taking a decision, as I said  just now, we will ask whether we can continue to expose our  soldiers to pointless risks. Our soldiers are brave, and I want  to pay homage to them. It is true soldiers are ready to take  risks, but not for just anything, not pointlessly, and not in an  ill-considered way.    [d'Arvor] (?Doesn't this) question the credibility of  Europe,  because Europe has repeated so many times in the last year and  one-half, with the risk of ending up losing credibility, that  this must end, and it has gone on? Sarajevo is geographically  exactly half way between Rome and Athens.    [Juppe] Credibility of Europe, yes and no. First, Europe has  done things, and France has done things. I am not ashamed of  what France has done. Just the opposite, because it is there on  the ground with its soldiers. We have collectively given a lot  of money for humanitarian aid, and for several months we have  proposed more and more diplomatic initiatives. We have done our  best, even if for the moment we have been unable to settle the  problem.    Europe also put a peace plan on the table in November,  December, which is the only plan for a political settlement that  exists, and let me remind you that the three parties -- Muslim,  Croat, and Serb -- have agreed on its principles. It is true  that yesterday I would have preferred Europe to have been a bit  more courageous, perhaps.    [d'Arvor] Thank you for responding to our invitation, Mr.  Juppe.</p>

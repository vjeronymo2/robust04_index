Although the production lines of F-16 fighters for the US  Air  Force will be closed, a ministry official said, production for  foreign military sales will continue.    The official quoted a US Air Force spokesman as saying that  the US Air Force does not want to buy any more F-16s because  there is already an oversupply of the fighters.    The Bush administration agreed to sell Taiwan 150 F-16s in  1992 defying strong protest from Beijing. The US Government has  showed many times its commitment to fulfill the contract, the  official added.    The first batch of fighters are expected to be delivered in  mid-1996, he said.</p>

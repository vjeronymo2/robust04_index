			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Dizzy at 8% but now up or down? - Patrick Harverson explains why the long bond yield rattled markets Although Wall Street had been expecting it for some time, when the yield on the 30-year US government bond closed above 8 per cent for the first time in 2 1/2 years on Monday night, it still sent a shudder through financial markets. Analysts throughout the US attested to the significance of the bond yield breaking through that barrier. Mr Robert Brusca, chief economist at Nikko Securities in New York, said. 'Psychologically, this is kind of chilling to people - it tends to make them pessimistic.' Mr Lincoln Anderson, director of global research at Fidelity, the big US mutual funds group based in Boston, agreed: 'It's an important level - you get through 8 per cent, and suddenly you start thinking about 9 per cent.' Bond prices have been falling - and correspondingly, yields rising - since late last year, when the yield on the long bond hit a 30-year low of 5.79 per cent. At first, the market's decline was prompted by expectations that rising economic growth would lead to higher inflation, which undermines the value of fixed-income investments such as bonds. The sell-off in the bond market, however, did not really begin to pick up until February, when the Federal Reserve engineered the first of a string of interest rate increases aimed at subduing economic growth and inflation. The tightening of monetary policy by the Fed, which has raised to 4.75 per cent short-term interest rates from below 3 per cent in January, was partly intended to reassure investors the Fed had inflation under control. The bond market was not reassured. To many investors, the Fed's decision to raise interest rates five times in seven months signalled that the central bank was worried that inflationary pressures were building up in an overheating economy. At the same time, the markets have had to cope with a steady slide in the value of the dollar against the German mark and Japanese yen, which has raised the possibility that the Fed would have to raise interest rates even more to support an ailing currency. So, when the bond yield closed above 8 per cent in New York on Monday, no one was particularly surprised. Yet, if an 8 per cent bond yield is some sort of watershed, what are the implications for US financial markets? Mr Anderson of Fidelity believes the biggest problem in the markets is not high bond yields, but the uncertainty surrounding Fed policy, which is diverting global money flows away from the US. The question everyone wants to know, he says, is how much higher will the Fed raise rates? 'It's all about capital flows. No one wants to be in a market where the central bank's tightening.' Mr John Lipsky, chief economist at Salomon Brothers, agrees. 'There's little reason to expect a turnround in international investor attitudes any time soon.' At some stage, however, yields will reach a point where they are high enough to start luring money away from stocks and into bonds - reversing the process which saw billions of dollars flow out of secure but poorly-yielding government securities and into stocks during the low-interest environment of 1990-1993. While this is bad news for stocks, it bodes well for short-term government bonds, and short-term yields. There are also grounds for optimism over long-term yields. Essentially, an 8 per cent bond yield reflects the market's fears of higher inflation. Those fears, however, may never be realised if the Fed's rate increases begin to slow down the economy, and with it the rate of inflation. At some point, investors will realise that with inflation less threatening than feared, yields are not going any higher. Mr Brusca of Nikko Securities believes the worst may be over for the bond market. 'I don't think yields are going much higher from where they are right now. There are things in the works that are slowing this economy down.' Consequently, he believes it is time for investors to buy bonds. 'If you have any kind of longer term perspective, these are world-class interest rates. This is a point where an economic pragmatist has to say: 'You've got to buy bonds.''

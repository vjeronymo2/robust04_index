			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Fashion: Plundering the 1970s for a little flare - Light and fluid is the style for spring, says Avril Groom, decoder of catwalk messages AFTER THREE weeks of hype and hysteria at the international spring fashion collections there is one worry for the consumer: coping with the 1970s re-run. The headline-makers have been unwearable chiffon, hippy tunics and elephantine flares. But media reaction is as extreme as the fashion shows, and it can be hard to pick out the message from the catwalk frippery. The message is nowhere near as frightening as the pictures make it seem. You do not have to don hippy beads and flared trousers, but the 1970s will be the big fashion theme next spring. You do not have to waft around in transparent layers, but lightness and fluidity will be the bywords. The real master designers assimilate radical changes and render them at once creative and comprehensible. Armani, Montana, Chanel and Lacroix have made the change from tailoring to softness seamlessly. The divisions which existed in the 1980s between glitzy tailoring and the torn black layers of the avant-garde are blurred. Now everyone does long, light layers - even Rei Kawakubo of Comme des Garcons. Its whole show was in lily-pale, 'decoloured' fabrics. Designers are united in replacing the tyranny of the label with a new softness and romanticism. The avant-garde view is that confident, modern women no longer need the body armour of a tailored jacket, although the cynical might argue that the new softness has happened because such a fait accompli is now the only way to part women from their cash. Choosing the 1970s as inspiration has both advantages and a flaw. The original fashion arose out of changes in society and the 'free spirit' mentality. In today's terms this means the freedom to go as far into this look as suits you - it is the generally fluid impression that counts, not how flared your loons are. The flaw is that, as fashion plunders its increasingly recent past for inspiration, the only people who think it new and exciting are too young to afford designer clothes. In the spirit of the 1970s, when recycling was last fashionable, the young will find it in thrift shops. The rest of us just need to remember the general 1970s outline. Some original items stand the test of time. You are lucky if you have anything by Ossie Clark or Biba in your wardrobe, luckier yet if you can still get into it. Otherwise, look for ideas that embody the spirit while keeping it contemporary. Take the military jacket. Christian Lacroix knows how to make it modern, keeping its shape crisp and confining historical references to contrasting details and teaming it with longline stretch knits or wide trousers, in vivid, clear colours or dazzling psychedelic prints. So does Italian-backed, but British-trained and based, Rifat Ozbek, designer of the year, who makes it pirate-style as part of a historical South Seas fantasy involving ikat-printed stretch leggings or sarongs and gauzy blouses with deep lace edgings. This was one of Milan's best-received shows and Ozbek anticipates an increase in turnover from Pounds 7m to around Pounds 12m next year. Karl Lagerfeld, who justifies his soubriquet of 'Kaiser' by designing three collections a season in Paris, knows a thing or two about jackets. But at Chloe, whose new owners Dunhill have wooed him back after ten years' absence, he first succeeded with fragile, lace-trimmed dresses and he returns to these in playfully hippy guise, as pastel, narrow-shouldered, fluted tunics over long, fluted skirts or soft flares. However, his own-label collection is mostly tailoring, pretty in an hourglass-curvy, redingote shape over a softly bias-cut chiffon skirt or skinny striped jersey. He saves his best for the discipline of Chanel where, amid rumours of falling sales, he makes every new trend look wearable. The military jacket is cropped above the waist to show off flared pants or jeans, classic tweed jackets are trimmed with a faded, 1940s-style print and the finale is all fresh white linen embroidered like cutwork tablecloths. Karl's little joke is Chanel Y-fronts - labels still rule for those prepared to pay for the privilege of that logo on their knickers. Faded prints are everywhere, most often as flowers or soft checks on the new dress, gently bias-cut and high-waisted or seamed under the bust. Lacroix and Katharine Hamnett say it with flowers, Ghost layers it with floppy, dusty-shaded ruffled tunics and John Galliano layers it wildly in chiffon and old lace with uncommercial abandon. Joker Jean-Paul Gaultier, who puts shirtsleeves on trousers and chest-wigs on women, wraps the dress in lace over skinny striped jersey and uses lace for wide-legged trouser-suits as another dimension in the transparency game. And then there are those trousers. Flares only really convince at Claude Montana, who widens them out gently and makes them in such fluid silky knit they are almost liquid - perfect holiday evening pants. Montana has no truck with hippies but explores one other rich seam of inspiration - Africa. He tattoos tribal patterns in gold on to gentle, spice-coloured suede and refines his favourite safari-jacket shape into simple soft curves. The safari theme, in languid colonial guise, is followed strongly by London designers Arabella Pollen, Ally Capellino and Jasper Conran. London also produces the best alternative to trousers, the long, full skirt. In white linen with Prince of Wales check jacket at Roland Klein or in broderie anglaise with curvy denim at John Richmond it loses any nostalgia. At Vivienne Westwood, with a curvy peplumed jacket it smacks of the elegant New Look. For evening it blooms into bold monochrome stripes, spots or checks and, in Paris, into faded satin from Westwood and extraordinary confections of metallic net from Romeo Gigli. In every case, only the simplest wisp of top goes with it. For sophisticates, the long sarong is less ingenue, in subtle Indian-print, sequinned chiffon from Armani, in shimmery muted devore velvet at Conran. Both fabrics are 1970s inspired but, like all the best of spring's designs, they whisper it rather than shout.</p>

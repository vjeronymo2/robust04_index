			<p>Language: <F P=105> Vietnamese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Criminal Court of the Supreme People's Court  entered its third day of work in Hanoi today. The case in this  trial, which is preliminary as well as final, involves  roundabout dealings with 4,000 tons of steel designed for the  construction of the north-south 500-kilovolt powerline. These  dealings caused 3.1 billion dong in losses to the state budget.    This afternoon -- after two and a half days of interrogating  the suspects, witnesses, and some relevant public organs -- Mr.  Nguyen Tien Dam, a senior officer who represented the Supreme  People's Organ of Control at the trial, presented a conviction  report. Afterward, lawyers continued their defense of the  suspects in this case.    The court will continue its session on Monday, 21 February.</p>

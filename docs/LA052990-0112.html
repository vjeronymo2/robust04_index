			<p><P> May 29, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> YOUTH SPORTS GROUPS LOOK FOR HOME FIELD  </P> <P> When the Ocean View Little League received word last year that it would have to  find a new place to play its games, it was the last straw for Tom Duchene and  Jim Ruziecki.  </P> <P> Because the former Rancho View School site was scheduled to be developed, the  league would have to move for the sixth time in its 30-year history.  </P> <P> Duchene and Ruziecki, who help coordinate the league, decided that it needed a  permanent home. And so in the last year, they organized a coalition of 12 youth  groups facing the same problem and came up with a plan.  </P> <P> The coalition is proposing a 17-acre, lighted youth sports complex in an  undeveloped area of Huntington Central Park. The plan, which city staff  officials have begun studying, would include six baseball diamonds and four  soccer-football fields west of Golden West Street and Talbert Avenue.  </P> <P> It would also end the roaming from place to place as former school sites are  sold for development.  </P> <P> "We have just gotten a little fed up with youth sports always winding up on the  short end of things," said Duchene, the lead spokesman for the coalition.  </P> <P> Under the plan, the groups would lease the property from the city and split the  operational costs.  </P> <P> The proposal has the backing of Councilman Don MacAllister, and other council  members agree such a facility is needed. But proponents of the $2-million  complex face several major hurdles, including how to pay for the facility.  </P> <P> Another worry is whether the targeted land can be developed into a series of  sports fields.  </P> <P> During the past decade, the area has twice been considered for similar sports  facilities. Since then, City Council members have designated the region as a  passive park, although "that could change," said Jim Engle, the city's parks  and recreation superintendent.  </P> <P> Also, if the park is used for the complex, it may be ineligible for certain  state and federal park funds, Engle said.  </P> <P> Regardless, Duchene said he believes that the city has "some responsibility" to  provide a youth sports facility.  </P> <P> "We're running out of places we can go to," he said. "The city has to address  what they're going to do with all these kids running around." JOHN PENNER  </P></p>

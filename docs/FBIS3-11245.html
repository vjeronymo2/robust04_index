			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The government platform of the PDC [Christian  Democratic Party] calls for the creation of an equitable,  binding, and modern economy by broadening the business base, a  frontal attack on extreme poverty, and the creation of new  economic and social agents. PDC priorities are to invest in  people and focus national efforts on the universalization of  services, like education, health, nutrition, environmental  protection, and potable water. It will seek to increase fiscal  reform to ensure that the state has the necessary resources to  invest in these areas.    Secondly, the PDC will broaden and strengthen the business  base. It offers the facilities to any Salvadoran who wants to  establish his own business. It will strengthen those who already  own businesses and will promote mini-, small-, and medium-scale  businessmen as well as farmers and professionals. The third axis  of the PDC strategy is to promote productive investments.    The party offers to generate new and better jobs; build a  healthy, strong, and productive economy through the creation of  a stable macroeconomic framework; promote an honest system of  economic incentives; and increase public and private savings  nationwide. It also proposes programs to promote the productive  use of remittances and the participation of the private sector  in areas like energy and communications.    The policies proposed to promote productive investment  include a broadening of financial reform, including the creation  of a special financial system to meet the needs of farmers and  small-, and medium-scale businesses. The following existing  organizations, Agricultural Development Bank, FIGAPE [expansion  unknown], Credit Federation, and all nongovernmental  organizations that grant credit to the sector, would comprise  this system. It proposes defining and implementing a  comprehensive industrialization and productive reorganization  policy and special programs to promote foreign investment.  <H5>  Points by Sector </H5>   The PDC platform emphasizes the importance of modernizing  and  diversifying agriculture by creating the National Agricultural  Council, which would represent the sector tasked with defining  national agricultural policy.    The PDC offers to reform state-owned institutions related to  the agricultural sector. This reform would seek to decentralize  agricultural support services and modernize its institutions. It  seeks to find realistic and viable solutions to banking and  agricultural problems and farmers who suffered the effects of  the armed conflict. This policy seeks to comply with the  "Rehabilitation of Production Sectors Affected By the Armed  Conflict Law."    The PDC offers to implement a comprehensive policy to  promote  agricultural exports, privatize state-owned assets related to  the agricultural sector by granting privileges to small- and  medium- scale farmers and cooperative member associations, and  promote a comprehensive policy of technical and technological  assistance in this sector.    The government strategy proposes strengthening a special  financial system for the business sector through modern methods  that are in keeping with characteristics and the beginning of  production reorganization to increase competitiveness in the  face of foreign competition, including measures like:    -- Short-term financing for working capital and medium- and  long- term financing for the acquisition of machinery and  equipment in favorable conditions.    -- the development of business training programs.    -- the application of a human resources program in this  sector.    The plan includes establishing a professional training  program with post-graduate scholarships and financing for  companies that offer professional and consultation services. It  suggests implementing scientific-technological strategies  focused on the private sector, government, and academic  institutions to promote the creation and strengthening of  professional associations.  <H5>  External Sector </H5>   The PDC proposes to promote exports by creating a joint  organization between GOES [expansion unknown] and the private  sector which would be tasked with coordinating and implementing  the export policy. It calls for the establishment of adequate  macroeconomic incentives (stable and realistic exchange rates as  well as timely financial resources). Also, the creation of an  international network to promote the country's export offers and  the establishment of a productive reorganization program to  support the sectors that were and will be affected by the  commercial liberalization process.</p>

			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / World Trade News: AT&amp;T secures lucrative Chinese telephone deal AMERICAN Telephone and Telegraph has reached agreement with the China National Post and Telecommunications Industry Corporation to co-produce telephone systems and other communications equipment for the booming China market. The memorandum of understanding, signed at the weekend, is a further indication that the US communications giant is poised to make substantial inroads into one of the world's largest telecommunications markets after several false starts. In February, AT&amp;T signed an umbrella agreement with China's state planning commission to provide telecommunications equipment and training. This was seen as a breakthrough for the US company, which had previously been squeezed from the lucrative China switching market, partly in reprisal for its refusal in the late 1970s to provide the Chinese with advanced switching equipment. AT&amp;T's re-entry to the China market was facilitated partly by fair trade pressures brought by the US administration, and also because the Chinese are looking for ways to ease criticism of their huge Dollars 18bn (Pounds 12.6bn) trade surplus with the US. Mr Gary Hickox, an AT&amp;T marketing vice-president, said that AT&amp;T, in partnership with manufacturer S. Megga and PTIC, planned to produce cordless telephones, digital answering machines, fax machines, videophones and other telecommunications products. AT&amp;T executives have been quoted as saying that the China market could mean 'billions of dollars in revenue over the next decade'. 'The size of the Chinese telecommunications market is such that a change of one per cent in the tele-density, or the number of telephones for 100 people, is equal to about 12m lines,' Mr Randall Tobias, AT&amp;T's vice-chairman said in February in Beijing. AT&amp;T, which has entered joint ventures in China to produce fibre optic cable and transmission equipment, registered sales in China last year of about Dollars 100m.</p>

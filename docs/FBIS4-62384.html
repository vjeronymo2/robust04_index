			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 14 May -- The Chief Command of the Russian  Navy, the Ministry for Emergency Situations, and the Pacific  Fleet's Command are undertaking all possible measures to  eliminate the consequences of today's explosion that resulted  from a fire at the fleet's aviation munitions dump near the  village of Novonezhino in Maritime Kray.    ITAR-TASS has been told in the press center of the Russian  Navy that an armored group of a Pacific Fleet coastal defense  formation, tanks, and armored personnel carriers are operating  in the area; some of the fleet's aircraft (a plane and a  helicopter) have been brought in to study the site of the  accident.    According to data currently available, there have been no  victims among the guards or the personnel servicing the dump.    According to the assessments of specialists, the distance to  which shrapnel will scatter as a result of the munitions'  explosions (conventional munitions were stored at the dump)  rules out the possibility of their falling on housing and other  buildings of the civilian population of the villages of  Novonezhino and Romanovka.    The situation in the disaster area is under unremitting  control.</p>

			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Porous Haiti embargo hits the poor most: William Spindler and Jurek Martin on 'dilatory' moves IN THE fashionable shops of Petionville, close to Port-au-Prince, Haiti's capital, there are few signs that the country is under an economic embargo. Everything from French wines to four-wheel-drive vehicles can be purchased - at a price. It is the poor in Haiti, the most impoverished nation in the Caribbean, who are feeling the effects of an embargo imposed by the Organisation of American States in 1991. The cost of their essential goods has gone up as a result and most aid projects have been suspended. Even the escape routes by sea to the US have dwindled in the face of US coast guard patrols. The question of tightening the economic screws on the Haitian regime to persuade it to allow the return of the ousted president, Fr Jean-Bertrand Aristide, continues to divide the outside world. Mr Dante Caputo, the former Argentine foreign minister and the envoy appointed by the UN and the OAS, said recently that it was 'time to stop dilatory manoeuvres'. Last Friday, in a tacit recognition that diplomacy had so far achieved little, the US increased the pressure, freezing the US assets of 83 individuals and 35 Haitian institutions considered to support the current regime in Port-au-Prince, including those of Mr Marc Bazin, the prime minister installed by the military and who resigned yesterday. Individuals and their families will be denied US visas and officials in Washington freely speculated that an oil embargo might be next. This action followed the breakdown of Mr Caputo's negotiations over the inability of all parties, including Fr Aristide, to agree on the deployment of a 500-strong UN police force to ensure that his return is not accompanied by civil unrest. Nevertheless the latest US moves have been criticised as too gradualist. An oil embargo and the suspension of regular air travel are frequently advanced as the sort of sanctions which, short of military intervention, are more likely to force a settlement. The congressional black caucus has been among those pressing the administration of President Bill Clinton for a tougher stand than existing policies, which resemble in many ways those of President George Bush. As it is, the effect of economic sanctions on Haiti's elite, parties to the negotiations, have not been great. Trade with Europe, which is unaffected by the embargo, has increased. Ships from the Dutch dependencies of Aruba and Curacao regularly bring the imported goods which Haiti's rich classes crave. There are easier ways to circumvent the embargo, however. The land border with the Dominican Republic, which occupies the eastern part of the island, is only a half-an-hour drive from Port-au-Prince. Indeed, one of the few projects undertaken by the military-backed government has been the completion of a paved road on which lorries bring goods from the republic. A mission from the United Nations Development Programme, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and other financial institutions has been in Haiti for an economic diagnosis. Mr Jose Luis Larrabure, the UNDP's resident representative, said the international community was worried about the economic crisis a future democratic government would inherit and emphasis was being given to planning projects that could be put into effect rapidly. The renewed talk of sanctions against the elite has been received with scepticism in Haiti, after similar threats in the past failed to materialise. Mixed US signals have not helped, with Washington's rhetoric calling for the restoration of Fr Aristide sometimes at odds with the views of US embassy officials in Haiti who are opposed to his return on the grounds that his brief period in office proved he was no democrat. Sources close to Fr Aristide have warned that a civil war may be imminent and, even before his resignation, little credibility was accorded Mr Bazin's offer to convene a national reconciliation conference. Meanwhile, the work of the international civilian mission of the OAS and the UN, which has been deployed to monitor human rights violations, will become more difficult. 'The perceived weakness of the international community will encourage attempts to neutralise or render ineffective our work,' said the executive director of the mission, Mr Colin Granderson.</p>

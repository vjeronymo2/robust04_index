			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by S.P. Stazic: "Stipac Provoked Rift in HSS"] </F>   [Text] Zagreb--The suspended members of the Croatian  Peasants' Party [HSS], Mirko Madjor and Dr. Josip Stojanovic,  confirmed at a news conference on Monday that the rift in the  party that they had announced has happened. The crisis of such  dimensions, in their words, was not triggered by them but by HSS  President Drago Stipac and Chief Secretary Mirko Glokovic.    Pointing to the further violation of the bylaws, Madjor  claims that Stipac has introduced tyranny into the HSS political  tyranny, which is contrary to the party's traditions. Both  Madjor and Stojanovic assert that a recent meeting of the HSS  Executive Committee was not conducted according to the bylaws,  and that Madjor, because of a telephone threat, was prevented  from participating in the meeting.    Following all of this, and especially following the Stipac  interview in SRPSKI GLASNIK in which he expressed his  concurrence that Croatia become a federation and a national  state of the Croat and Serb peoples, Madjor states that what is  at issue in the HSS is not just a conflict over organizational,  personnel, and financial issues, but a conflict of the political  and ideological views of Stupac and a group of people that  surrounds him as well as the "Kasinska" group.    Madjor and Stojanovic are also convinced that the public  will  soon find out on whose account and in whose interest Stipac set  off the conflict in the HSS. In a rather long speech, Ante  Babic, an HSS member and a minister plenipotentiary, as well as  head of the Information Section in the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs, gave his views, or rather aired the dirty linen of the  HSS publicly. That is to say, Babic had been declared a "mole of  the HDZ [Croatian Democratic Community]" by some HSS Presidency  members.    Defending himself, Babic stated that the epithet of "HDZ  mole" would be more suitable for Drago Stipac because, "I have  heard him say innumerable times that he had agreed precisely on  this with President Tudjman."    Babic said of Stipac that he is a "very narrow-minded person  who is not even capable of managing a local community, not to  mention the HSS." Stating that Dr. Tihomir Radja, a member of  the HSS Presidency, is close to Liberal circles, Babic informed  Stipac that it is precisely Radja who wanted to carry out a coup  last year in the HSS while he, as a president of the party, was  on a visit to Canada, and that Madjor and Stojanovic prevented  Radja from doing so. Babic at the end warned Drago Stipac that,  now that he no longer has people like Madjor and Stojanovic who  are loyal to him, Radja and the "present leadership of the HSS"  will remove him from his position as head of the party.</p>

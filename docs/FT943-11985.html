			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Markets Report: Pound slips against yen The breach of a key technical level of sterling against yen saw the UK currency slip on the foreign exchanges yesterday, writes Philip Gawith. Sterling ignored some good news in the CBI quarterly industrial trends survey and fell below Y150, a level that had held on previous occasions. It closed in London at Y149.533 from Monday's Y151.728. In thin trading conditions, the dollar slipped to close at Y98 from Y98.685, but was firmer against the D-Mark and finished at DM1.5865 from DM1.576. The market paid little attention to the Conference board's July consumer confidence index which slipped to 91.6, from 92.5 in June. Traders were keeping a close eye on the start of the Whitewater hearings before the House banking committee. In Europe, the D-Mark lost ground against most currencies. The Portuguese escudo responded positively to a rate cut which was seen as a sign of economic strength. The central bank cut 0.5 of a percentage point off its rates for draining funds and injecting emergency overnight funds, to 10.5 per cent and 13 per cent respectively. The escudo closed unchanged at Es102.3 against the D-Mark, its highest level since late April. In Israel, the central bank said it was raising short term interest rates by 0.5 of a percentage point to a minimum of 11.8 per cent. The move is aimed at combatting inflation which is expected to rise above the official 8 per cent target for the year. A feature of sterling's weakness has been the breakdown of its close relationship with the dollar. Until recently, statistical studies suggested that as much as 95 per cent of Dollars /Pounds moves over the past six months could be attributed to moves in the Dollars /D-Mark rate. When the dollar made a sharp recovery last week, however, sterling failed to follow. Mr Robert Thomas, currency strategist at Natwest Markets, commented: 'There was a presumption that the glue that had held sterling to the dollar as the US currency fell would work the other way too, but it seems to have weakened.' Analysts were at a loss to come up with any fundamental factors which might account for the pound's weakness. The sterling index fell to 78.6, from 79.1, despite the positive news in the CBI survey of manufacturing orders reaching a six year high. One possibility suggested was the resurgence of talk recently that Tory backbenchers, concerned about the government's popularity, might push for tax cuts this year. This would put pressure on sterling as the UK's fiscal position currently is not judged to be strong enough to accommodate tax cuts. Another possible factor contributing to sterling weakness was a newspaper report that the European Union might seek to force the UK to comply with the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty. If Mr Major distances himself from Europe, this could lead to selling of sterling in the short term. Part of the explanation for the fairly listless performance of the dollar is that there is little new information to chew on. 'From the market's point of view the problem is that we are not likely to see a policy change from the US or Germany for a number of weeks,' said Mr Tony Norfield, treasury economist at ABN-AMRO. The Bundesbank has frozen its repo rate at 4.85 per cent for the next four weeks, while the Federal Reserve is not expected to shift rates before the mid-August FOMC meeting. This did not stop Mr Wayne Angell, economist at Bear Stearns and former Fed governor, criticising the 4.25 per cent Fed funds rate as too accommodative. He suggested that as many as seven Fed banks might ask for a discount rate hike prior to the August FOMC meeting. There was also good news for the dollar in the form of supportive interest rate comments emerging from Germany. Mr Hilmar Kopper, chief executive of Deutsche Bank, told the bank's interim press conference that he expected the decline in short term interest rates to continue. His comments followed overnight observations from Mr Otmar Issing, a Bundesbank board member, who stressed that the 'summer break does not mean that we have rolled down the blinds and closed down policy. Rather, we have made clear that what we want is stability in the money markets and to calm down interest rate expectations,' he said. German call money firmed to 4.95/5.05 per cent ahead of today's repo where the rate has been fixed at 4.85 per cent. Ms Alison Cottrell, international economist at Midland Global Markets, predicts that only a low portion of bids are likely to be filled. 'With call money at 5 per cent and rising, and the repo rate a fixed 4.85 per cent, banks will bid for more funds than normal,' said Ms Cottrell. There is no downside risk of paying more, and in the expectation that others will do likewise, banks are likely to inflate their bids to ensure they get their share of funds. The Bank of England provided UK money markets with Pounds 450m assistance after forecasting a Pounds 550m shortage.</p>

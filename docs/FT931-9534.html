			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / N Koreans defy nuclear demands NORTH KOREA yesterday indicated it would reject a demand by the International Atomic Energy Agency to inspect suspected nuclear facilities. 'In our country there are no nuclear facilities that have not been reported, nor are there any nuclear-related materials hidden,' declared the Rodong Shinmun, the newspaper of the ruling Korean Workers' Party. If Pyongyang refuses the inspection, the issue could eventually be discussed by the United Nations Security Council, which could impose sanctions on North Korea. Officials at the IAEA in Vienna said Pyongyang had until Monday to approve a special visit by the agency's inspectors. 'The North Koreans are pretty much under the gun,' said one official. Failure to approve a visit would trigger a meeting later next week of the IAEA's 35-member board to which North Korea would be invited. The IAEA board includes the five permanent members of the UN Security Council - the US, UK, France, Russia and China. Mr Hans Blix, director general of the IEAE, met senior agency officials yesterday to consider what options the board might have in the event of Pyongyang's continued refusal. The special inspection is the first time in the IAEA's history that it has demanded to examine facilities that have not been declared to be part of a nation's nuclear programme. South Korean officials regard the IAEA demand as important in increasing pressure on North Korea to allow more nuclear inspections, including challenge inspections demanded by Seoul. But they expressed doubts whether China, North Korea's closest ally, would support sanctions if the issue reaches the UN Security Council, although Beijing might agree to mediate with Pyongyang to resolve the dispute. North Korea has refused IAEA inspectors access to two buildings in the Yongbyon nuclear complex that the agency suspects are nuclear material storage facilities.</p>

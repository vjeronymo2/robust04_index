			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The CMPC protein price proposal was supported at the hearing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by other hearing participants, including National Farmers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Organization (NFO), Kraft, Inc., Galloway Co., Wisconsin Cheese  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Makers Association (WCMA), National Cheese Institute (NCI),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Farmers Union Milk Marketing Cooperative (FUMMC), and the Trade  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Association of Proprietary Plants (TAPP). A witness for NCI  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> explained that if the protein price is set at too high a level,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cheese manufacturers would experience a declining gross margin as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the price for protein increases above the return the plant can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obtain from additional protein. He explained that this would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the case with the protein price as proposed by NAJ, but not with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the NCI and CMPC proposed protein price.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other witnesses supporting a lower protein price than that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed by NAJ explained that protein should not be priced at a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> high level because the higher price may disadvantage handlers who  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> do not manufacture cheese. They testified that the higher  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protein price would not be recoverable in certain products such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as nonfat dry milk, condensed milk, or certain Class II products,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and that even though the lower protein price still may not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recoverable, it offers the best alternative.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Galloway witness stated that if a multiple component  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pricing plan that derives a protein price from a cheese market  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> value were adopted, the protein price should represent a minimum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> value, should be based on the barrel cheese market, and should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not include a value for whey protein concentrate. He argued that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such a price would have the impact of minimizing the difference  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between the protein and other solids prices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The TAPP/FUMMC witness testified that protein should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> priced at a level somewhat below its full value in cheddar cheese  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and whey for several reasons. He said that too high a protein  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> price could invite the use of non-dairy protein, whey solids, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> casein, and thereby cause an increase in the production of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imitation cheese. He also said that since some Class II and III  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products do not recoup as much value from high protein milk as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cheese and cottage cheese, the protein price should be set at a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> level less than its full value for cheese. The witness expressed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concern that too high a protein price could result in a zero  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> value for the residual component, or other solids. According to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the witness, a zero value for the residual would fail to reflect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a realistic value, and would not cover a make allowance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the post-hearing brief filed by NAJ, the position of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> using a ``justifiably high'' protein price to send a signal to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> producers that protein is the most valuable component in milk was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reiterated. In post hearing briefs filed by CMPC, NFO, Kraft,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NCI, TAPP and FUMMC, Anderson-Erickson (A-E), and AMPI North  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Central Region, the computation of the protein price as proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by CMPC was supported. The reasons given in testimony for using  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a lower protein price than that proposed by NAJ were reiterated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in briefs. In addition, A-E, Kraft and AMPI North Central Region  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> argued that the difference between the barrel cheese price and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the block cheese price is due to the cost of packaging and other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonmilk factors, and therefore the barrel cheese price should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used for determining the protein price.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In pure economic terms the price of a product represents the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supply and demand for that product as affected by place, form,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and time. The problem with determining a price for protein  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contained in milk is that the protein is not marketed as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> separate unique product, but is marketed as an integral part of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> both fluid and manufactured dairy products. Therefore, in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determining an appropriate protein price, the value of protein in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dairy products is determined by using the value of a product  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whose yield is a function of the protein content of the milk. At  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this point in time no attempt is made to reflect the protein  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> content of milk in the value of milk used for fluid use. For  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this reason, the component pricing plan recommended in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decision does not apply to milk used for Class I purposes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

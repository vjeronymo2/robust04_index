The Abkhazian Information and Press Ministry released today  a  statement by the separatist parliament stressing that the  decision by Georgian lawmakers proved to their ignoring legal  norms. "The existing constitutions of Georgia and of Abkhazia  do not provide for dissolution of Abkhazia's supreme legislature  by the Georgian Parliament", the statement said. "By taking  this decision, lawmakers probably sought to disrupt negotiations  for a peaceful settlement in Abkhazia", it noted.    The Abkhazian Parliament reiterated its commitment to a  peaceful settlement of the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict. It  claimed that the decisions passed by the Georgian legislature  had nothing to do with the Republic of Abkhazia and only led to  spiralling tensions in Georgian-Abkhazian relations.</p>

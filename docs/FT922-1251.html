			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Survey of Indonesia (3): Human rights still an issue - Foreign Aid INDONESIA'S decision in March to reject aid from the Netherlands startled foreign donors not merely by its suddenness but also because of the uncharacteristically vitriolic language in which it was couched. Responding to Dutch criticism of the killing of at least 50 protestors by soldiers in Indonesian-annexed East Timor in November, the Jakarta government spurned all Dutch assistance and issued a statement condemning 'centuries of inhuman colonial subjugation' and the 'barbarous atrocities carried out by the colonial forces during the war of independence' in the 1940s. The government also dissolved the Inter-Governmental Group on Indonesia (IGGI), through which aid was pledged, because it had been chaired by the Netherlands, the former colonial power, since 1968. Coming from a country which received Dollars 4.75bn in pledges though the IGGI in 1991 alone, and which depends heavily on foreign aid for the development of its infrastructure as the economy expands, the decision could have been seen as remarkably rash. In fact, as President Suharto had presumably predicted, very little has changed and very little damage has been done, except to some of the 175 projects financed by the Dutch and to those Indonesian non-governmental organisations which relied on Dutch support. The World Bank will henceforth chair the donors' forum, which is due to meet in Paris in July, while both the Dutch and the Indonesian governments have taken pains to announce that they plan to continue and even strengthen their normal commercial relations. Everyone else has kept rather quiet. Most aid workers and diplomats believe that Indonesia's outburst was a calculated effort to boost the government's electoral appeal and appease the armed forces - which had been criticised in an official inquiry for their role in the East Timor shootings - without seriously endangering the flow of aid. 'President Suharto had to show the military that he was rapping their knuckles not because of external pressure alone,' said Mr Jusuf Wanandi of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Jakarta. The Dutch were the perfect target: as the ex-colonial power they are the traditional scapegoats for the country's ills; their aid pledged for the 1991-92 financial year amounted to only Dollars 91m; well behind the World Bank, Japan and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) - all of which promised more than Dollars 1bn. And Mr Jan Pronk, the Dutch development aid minister, was highly unpopular among Indonesian officials for his abrasive, emotional style of doing business both in the 1990s and in a previous tour of duty in the same job in the 1970s. 'Indonesia needs aid but in terms of major investment, in terms of agriculture, this comes from the World Bank and the ADB,' said one senior western diplomat. 'The rest, I'd say, is very marginal.' Significantly, countries such as Canada, which had been as outspoken as the Netherlands in their treatment of the East Timor incident, were ignored by Indonesia. Although some Indonesian ministers were unhappy with the ferocity of the Indonesian gesture and western governments were offended by the undiplomatic language of the statements about the Dutch, the decision struck a sympathetic chord with Indonesians. Mr Wanandi said it was unacceptable for the Dutch to continue ordering the Indonesians about after 300 years or for the west to take the high moral ground. 'Look at Los Angeles (where several people were killed in recent riots). For them to be condescending or coercive is not acceptable.' The sentiment was echoed by Mr Radius Prawiro, the senior minister supervising the economy, industry and development. 'What we do not like is when development assistance has been used to intimidate us,' he said in an interview. He thanked the Dutch for their support over the previous 24 years and predicted that overall development would not be seriously affected, since donor countries were free to fund whichever projects they regarded as suitable from Indonesia's 'blue book' of development plans, often in a field which allowed them to support their own industries. The larger issue of linkage between aid and human rights, however, is unlikely to go away. The European Community has made it clear in discussions with the Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean, the six-country group of which Indonesia is a member) that it would like to see progress on human rights and on the environment. Mr Prawiro did not sound too concerned. Overseas aid would account for 41.9 per cent of development funding in the projected 1992-93 budget, he said, compared with 52 per cent in 1991-92 and nearly 70 per cent two years ago. 'We actually have a negative outflow of capital with regard to borrowing from the so-called donor countries,' he said, noting that aid included loans as well as grants and that Indonesia was repaying Dollars 7bn a year. 'If we can't borrow from outside, it will be very difficult for us to repay the debts.'</p>

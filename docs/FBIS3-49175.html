			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Third Memorandum of Slovaks from Southern Slovakia," </F> adopted at the "sixth meeting of Slovaks living in southern  Slovakia" in Surany on 2 January]    [Text] We Slovaks, living since time immemorial in the  south of our homeland, appeal, in a situation that we cannot  call anything but one in which the state is endangered, to the  president, parliament, and Government of the Slovak Republic.    Now it is no longer just a matter of concern to us, who feel  discriminated against and endangered in our own country, a fact  to which we have been drawing attention, so far in vain, in our  earlier memorandums from 1990-93.    The appeal, issued by the so-called Association of Zitny  Ostrov Towns and Villages and that which is planned for Komarno  on 8 January 1994, is an obvious anticonstitutional attempt to  subvert the state. Therefore, we appeal:    1. To the supreme state bodies of the Slovak Republic not to  permit anticonstitutional goings-on in that assembly, and their  consequences.    2. To the National Council of the Slovak Republic [NRSR] to  revise its resolution of 23 June 1993 (concerning Council of  Europe recommendation Number 1201) in accordance with the  Constitution and the legal system of the Slovak Republic.    3. To the NRSR to pass a law on the protection of the state  language.    4. To ensure that at least one Slovak school or class be  functioning in every community of the Slovak Republic.    5. To ensure that, in the bilingual designation of towns and  communities, the transcription of their present Slovak names  into the language of the minority be used.    6. To the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to advise European  structures, and the Council of Europe in particular, that the  recognition of above-standard rights for the Hungarian minority  sets a dangerous precedent that might lead to destabilization in  other European countries as well.    7. To the church authorities to ensure that religious  services in the Slovak language be held in every town and  village.    8. To the NRSR to pass a law on the protection of the  Republic, in the spirit of the "Second Memorandum."  <H5>  To Citizens of Hungarian Nationality </H5>   Esteemed fellow citizens of Hungarian nationality! At the  threshold of the second year of our common republic, we appeal  to you, in the interest of continued peaceful coexistence, not  to yield to political pressures undermining our stability and,  thereby, head off the creation of any social conflicts.    The Slovak Republic is our common homeland and belongs to  all  of us. Let us therefore, as citizens, seek common ground; let us  seek the path toward unity and toward the stability and  enhancement of our common homeland.    Accept this new year's message as a call for further  peaceful  and virtuous coexistence in the common homeland.</p>

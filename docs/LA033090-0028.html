			<p><P> March 30, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEETING STATE'S WATER NEEDS  </P> <P> So Mayor Tom Bradley, assorted city officials and the MWD want my garden to  wither my car to look like the bottom of a bird cage and my body to smell like  last week's leftovers (Metro, March 23).  </P> <P> You'll forgive me if I say this won't wash. Not at all, especially when I see  huge companies hosing down their sidewalks, driveways, curbs and street  gutters.  </P> <P> It all makes me so mad, I think I'll go have a couple double waters, which come  from Arrowhead by the way.  </P> <P> AL JACOBS  </P> <P> Burbank  </P></p>

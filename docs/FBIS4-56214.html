			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina by Carlos </F> Zanabria Marrero at Antonio Maceo International Airport,  Santiago de Cuba, on 29 April -- recorded]    [Text] [Zanabria] Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina has  accompanied the Zambian president in his visit to Santiago de  Cuba. Since yesterday, Radio Rebelde, and particularly the Doing  Radio program, has been reporting on the campaign of violence  unleashed against the Cuban emigres who participated in the  Nation and the Emigre Community conference. What is your opinion?    [Robaina] I believe that to any Cuban who truly feels the  process we are undergoing, and is particularly interested in and  wishing to establish normal ties, such attitudes require nothing  else but the most determined and timely rejection. I believe  that this shows the political barbarism of the far right of that  Cuban community. This demonstrates the behavior of those we have  called hysterics. When we announced the conference and stated  that hysteria was not invited, I believe that the hysteria,  seeing itself not invited, refused to relinquish a forum and its  forum continues to be hysteria.    However, I am fully convinced that hysteria is challenged by  valor, dignity, and courage. This is why I believe that people  such as Magda [Montiel] and hundreds of others, who have yet to  become the target of these attacks ....[pauses] I believe we  have to realize that they act in this manner because we have  touched a nerve. Anything promoting civilized reconciliation, a  common path, and the kind of understanding that took place in  the conference, hurts them.    I do not believe that this requires comment. In my opinion  what this requires is boldness, valor, and commitment. What I  want to stress is that Cubans such as Magda, who acted and  continue to act as they have done, will not lack the support,  backing, understanding, and solidarity of those of us here.

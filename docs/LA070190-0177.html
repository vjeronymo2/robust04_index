			<p><P> July 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NAVRATILOVA AND SABATINI HAVE NO TROUBLE REACHING 4TH ROUND  </P> <P> The first time 21-year-old Karin Kschwendt met Martina Navratilova was shortly  before they went out on the court Saturday to play their third-round match.  </P> <P> "My heart was booming," said Kschwendt, the first player from Luxembourg to  compete at Wimbledon.  </P> <P> Navratilova won, 6-1, 6-1, and advanced to the quarterfinals against Judith  Weisner of Austria, who defeated Laura Gildemeister of Peru, 6-2, 7-6 (7-5).  </P> <P> Kschwendt went quickly, in 44 minutes.  </P> <P> "It's good my parents did not come," she said.  </P> <P> Navratilova scouted Kschwendt's second-round match so she knew what Kschwendt  looked like. Kschwendt already knew what Navratilova looked like, but she  wasn't prepared for how she felt to see her in person.  </P> <P> "I knew her so well from TV, but to meet her in real life, it's really scary,"  Kschwendt said.  </P> <P> Fourth-seeded Gabriela Sabatini of Argentina received no scares in her  third-round match with France's Catherine Tanvier, 6-4, 6-2.

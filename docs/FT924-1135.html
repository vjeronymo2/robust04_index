			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / International Company News: Isuzu may restructure domestic production ISUZU Motors, the Japanese car maker with links to General Motors of the US, is close to announcing a plan to withdraw from the domestic passenger car market in order to concentrate on the production of commercial vehicles and trucks. The company confirmed yesterday that it was considering pulling out from passenger cars to end two years of large losses. Isuzu reported a pre-tax loss of Y48.4bn (Dollars 389m) in the year ended October 1991 and is expected to report a loss of about Y30bn in the year just ended. Isuzu said yesterday that it would commission GM, which has a 37 per cent stake in the Japanese maker, to produce medium-sized trucks in the US from early 1994 as part of an expanded partnership between the two companies. The commissioned production at a GM plant in Wisconsin would initially be about 6,000 trucks annually, with Isuzu exporting the chassis and the cabs, and GM providing the engine and transmission. Isuzu's commissioning of production is intended to make use of excess capacity in GM facilities and lift the Japanese company's profile in the US, where its distribution network has been strengthened. Passenger cars and vans account for about 10 per cent of Isuzu's sales, while trucks and buses account for 57 per cent and engines, parts and other products for the remaining 33 per cent. Passenger car sales have fallen sharply over the past year in Japan and have remained weak. This has encouraged price cuts among leading vehicle makers which put extra pressure on the already weak Isuzu. The company has trimmed its force of temporary workers and streamlined its component supply systems, but believes that a stronger emphasis on truck production is the best means of ensuring a return to profits. The agreement by NEC, the Japanese electronics company, to acquire a 4.99 per cent of Control Data Systems (CDS) of the US, involves an agreement under which CDS will sell computers made by NEC on an original equipment basis. The computers are under development and are expected to be marketed during the second half of 1993.</p>

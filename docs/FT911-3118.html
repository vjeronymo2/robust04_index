			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / FT Law Report: No damages for berthing delay WORLD NAVIGATION Court of Appeal (Lord Justice Parker, Lord Justice Staughton and Sir David Croom-Johnson): April 12 1991 DAMAGES FOR breach of contract are assessed on the basis of what is required to put the plaintiff in the same position as if there had been no breach and the defendants had performed their obligations in the way they were contractually entitled to perform them, not as if there had been no breach and they had performed their obligations in the way they did in fact perform them. Accordingly, where cargo sellers delay the vessel's berthing for loading, but load within the sale contract time at a faster rate than the contractual minimum, the buyers cannot claim on the basis that loading would probably have been at that faster rate had there been no delay, and that the vessel would therefore have been freed earlier thus diminishing their demurrage costs. The Court of Appeal so held when allowing an appeal by Roplack Enterprises SA, sellers of maize shipped on World Navigation, from Mr Justice Phillips's decision in favour of the claimant buyers, Kurt A Becher gmbH, on their appeal from the Board of Appeal of the Grain and Feed Trade Association (Gafta). LORD JUSTICE PARKER said that three contracts for the sale of maize provided for shipment by instalments in April, May and June 1985. The quantity to be shipped in June was 12,000 tonnes. Each contract was on Gafta 64 terms and Argentine Centro terms. Clause 7 of Gafta 64 provided that the vessel should load 'in accordance with the custom at port of loading unless otherwise stipulated'. The Centro clauses provided that buyers should give 15 days' notice of readiness to load; and that once the vessel was berthed 'sellers guarantee . . . a minimum average loading rate of 500 tonnes per weather working day, Sundays, holidays and Saturday afternoons excepted'. On May 24 1985 the buyers nominated World Navigation to load the June portion. She reached Zona Comun on June 13 and tendered readiness to load. She would have berthed on June 25 had the shippers' loading documentation been in order. It was not. She was by-passed by other vessels next in line, and did not berth until July 18. Between July 18 and July 22 she loaded 24,000 tonnes, including the 12,000-tonne June portion. The buyers claimed the sellers were in breach of contract in not having the goods ready to load. They contended that damages consisted in demurrage they had had to pay under the charterparty by which they had provided the vessel. The sellers disputed the claim. They said they were not in breach of any obligation and even if they were, the buyers had suffered no damage, because if the vessel had kept her turn on June 25 they would have had 48 days to load the 24,000 tonnes, and loading had been completed within that time. Alternatively, to load the 12,000 tonnes they had 24 days, and had completed in time. Arbitrators upheld the buyers' claim. The Gafta Board of Appeal allowed an appeal on the ground that the vessel used less than 18 days laytime, whereas the contract allowed 24 days. Mr Justice Phillips allowed the buyers' appeal and remitted the award to the Board of Appeal for reconsideration in the light of his judgment. The sellers now appealed. Assuming that the sellers were in breach of contract in not having the necessary documentation to enable the vessel to keep her turn on June 25, the first question was what was their obligation with regard to rate of loading once she had berthed? The buyers contended that although the Centro clause provided for a minimum average of 500 tonnes per weather working day, the Gafta obligation was to load according to the custom of the port. They said port custom might be to load by a method which would produce a faster rate. Mr Justice Phillips rightly rejected that contention. The Gafta provision was that the vessel was to load in accordance with port custom 'unless otherwise stipulated'. The Centro clause did otherwise stipulate. Under that clause the buyer would not be in breach if he maintained an average of at least 500 tonnes a day. Accordingly, the sellers were entitled, once the vessel was in berth, to take up to 48 counting days to load the complete cargo, or 24 counting days to load the three contracts. Assuming again that the sellers were in breach in not having the documentation ready, the next question was on what basis should damages be assessed? The buyers contended that, given that the vessel was delayed by the breach, the proper course was to consider what would probably have happened had there been no breach. If the probability was that she would have loaded at the same rate as she actually did unload, they were entitled to damages because, but for the breach, the vessel would have been free and demurrage would have ceased to accrue by July 1. Their damage, argued the buyers, was the demurrage incurred between July 1 and July 22 when the vessel was finally free. What they claimed was the value of the lost chance of freeing the vessel earlier. The sellers contended that no damage had been suffered because, had the vessel berthed on June 26, they would not have been obliged to complete loading and free the vessel any earlier than they did. In Lavarack v Woods (1967) 1 QB 278 Lord Denning MR in minority said that a wrongfully dismissed servant was entitled to bonuses he might reasonably have expected to receive, because the employer had deprived him of the chance of receiving them. He said 'he is entitled to compensation for the loss of the chance', even though he had no legal right to receive the bonuses. The majority would have none of that. Lord Diplock said: 'The law is concerned with legal obligations only . . . not with expectations, however reasonable.' The buyers relied on Paula Lee v Robert Zehil (1983) 2 All ER 390,397,393 where the defendants wrongfully repudiated a contract to buy 16,000 garments each season from the plaintiff dress manufacturer. The plaintiff contended that damages should be assessed on the average of all his garments. Mr Justice Mustill concluded that damages should be assessed in terms of such reasonable selection of garments as would 'yield the lowest price'. Earlier, however, he said that inquiry into the plaintiff's actual position in face of the breach and his position if the contract had been performed, involved 'identification of the promise, followed by a valuation of its promised worth to the promisee'. He said each part of the inquiry might involve considering a choice which would have been open to the promisor. Mr Justice Phillips identified the broken obligation as a single discrete obligation to procure appropriate loading documents. He said the inquiry concerned valuation. He said that when assessing damages the board must ask how long loading would have taken had World Navigator berthed promptly; and that the question was to be answered, not by assuming that the sellers would have loaded at the slowest permissible rate, but by considering all factors that would have been likely to influence their conduct. The judge was right that the breach was of a single discrete obligation. One must, however, consider the consequences to the buyers of the breach and what was required to put them in the same position as if it had not occurred. In that event laytime would have begun to run on June 26. The sellers' obligation would have been to load in the number of counting days under the Centro terms, but no more. They did so. Despite the breach the buyers got that to which they would have been entitled had there been no breach. To accept the buyers' contention would be to make the sellers pay damages for failing to do that which they were not obliged to do. In the light of those conclusions it was unnecessary to decide the extent of the sellers' obligation to enable the vessel to reach berth. The appeal was allowed. The award of the Board of Appeal was affirmed. Their Lordships gave concurring judgments. For the buyers: Martin Moore-Bick QC and Geraldine Clark (Richards Butler) For the sellers: David Johnson QC and Mark Havelock-Allan (Sinclair Roche &amp; Temperley)</p>

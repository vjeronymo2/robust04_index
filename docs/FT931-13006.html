			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / Bank of Japan pressed to cut official interest rates PRESSURE on the Bank of Japan for a cut in official interest rates intensified yesterday, as the bank's regional branch managers gathered in Tokyo to discuss the impact of the economic slowdown. The depth of the downturn was emphasised by the release of figures showing a 3.3 per cent fall in department store sales last year, the first year-on-year decline since the Japan Department Stores' Association began collecting national data in 1965. Meanwhile, the Real Estate Economic Institute said apartment sales last year were down 11.6 per cent to 75,173, the lowest total since 1976 and about half the figure for 1990, when property speculation peaked. The average price of an apartment fell 12.3 per cent to Y39.38m (Pounds 202,000). Officials of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and business organisations called on the Bank of Japan to reduce the official discount rate (ODR) from the present 3.25 per cent to 2.75 per cent or even 2.5 per cent to stimulate the flagging economy and bolster a still weak stock market. Mr Yasushi Mieno, the bank's governor, admitted that economic conditions are 'severe' but said that a promised increase in public works spending should assist in reviving demand. However, it is understood that many regional branch managers in Tokyo for the two-day meeting are advising that an ODR rate cut should come quickly. The central bank has been surprised by the erosion of consumer confidence in recent months, a trend highlighted by the department stores' sales statistics. Clothing sales fell 3 per cent last year, household supplies were down 7 per cent and foodstuff sales rose a slim 0.1 per cent. Department store sales fell 8.1 per cent in December, compared with the same month a year earlier, suggesting that consumer confidence is weakening, partly due to a cut in year-end bonuses and a decrease in overtime payments. Clothing sales were down 9.2 per cent and sales of personal items fell 6 per cent. The ODR was last cut in July last year, and Bank of Japan officials are concerned that the expectation of another cut is prompting consumers to delay spending in areas such as housing and cars. Japanese business leaders also want a quick announcement, as the fiscal year ends in March, and many companies, financial and non-financial, will be forced to announce large appraisal losses on stock portfolios unless the market rises sharply in coming weeks.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Chisinau, BASAPRESS, 11/6/1994 -- After the  Constitution is adopted, it will be necessary to inaugurate a  Constitutional Court, declared to BASA Eugen Rusu, chairman of  the parliamentary commission for appointments and statutes,  mentioning that Moldova has no organ which could assure that the  presidential decrees, governmental and other institutions'  decisions do not violate the stipulations of the Constitution.  He announced that between June 8th and 9th he participated,  along with Nicolae Timofte, vice president of the Supreme Court,  and Nicolae Uncu, vice-prosecutor of the Republic, at a seminar  organized by the CSCE in collaboration with the Romanian  Constitutional Court. At the Bucharest seminar, representatives  of the constitutional courts of many European countries offered  to give consultations on the organization of the Moldovan  Constitutional Court. According to Rusu, the former Parliament  elaborated a draft law on the Constitutional Court, which is to  be sent to the Council of Europe's Commission for Democracy and  Justice, whose headquarters are in Venice, to obtain eventual  notification, and later to be examined by the Chisinau  Parliament.</p>

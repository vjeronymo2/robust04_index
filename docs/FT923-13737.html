			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Property: The sabres rattle in a quiet country corner - David Hoppit on the dispute over the future of Pounds 4.5m Heveningham Hall, the 'grandest Georgian mansion in Suffolk' A DISPUTE that had been brewing for more than a decade in a tranquil corner of East Anglia flared this week as one of England's finest houses became the focus of a game of real-life monopoly. The casus beli is Heveningham Hall, half way between Ipswich and Norwich, described by the architecture historian Nikolaus Pevsner as 'the grandest Georgian mansion in Suffolk'. It is owned through default by the United Bank of Kuwait. Rattling the sabres are local conservation groups and the Suffolk Preservation Trust, encouraged last week by a parliamentary question from Tam Dalyell (Lab. Linlithgow). The story of Heveningham Hall has become common in recent years: a losing struggle to maintain a family home. The mansion, built in 1777, finally passed to the stewardship of the nation in lieu of death duties in 1970. For 11 years the estate was administered by the National Trust. In 1981, it was sold for Pounds 726,000 to an investment trust headed by an Iraqi businessman, Abdul Amir al-Ghazzi. Al-Ghazzi, untutored in public relations, did not endear himself to the locals. The house was boarded up and the formal gardens, by Capability Brown, ran wild. Rumours of neglect and pilfering spread; a fire in 1984 added to local anger at what was perceived as a case of heritage vandalism; however, those privy to the 'goings on' behind the shutters maintain that a large programme of restoration was in progress. The work gobbled money - up to Pounds 5m; some believe the debt contributed to al-Ghazzi's death in March last year. The bank then called in the Pounds 3m loan and took over the hall. Now the Grade I mansion is being offered for sale by Savills with Knight Frank and Rutley; the price suggested is Pounds 4.5m. Geoffrey van Cutsem, of Savills, took representatives of the National Trust and the National Heritage Memorial Fund around the mansion. 'They probably can't afford to buy it but all were very impressed by the condition of the main rooms,' he said. 'This is a huge house, nearly 100 yards long; yet when al Ghazzi bought it there were only two bathrooms. Architectural purists may not like the en suite bathrooms he has built in each of the main bedrooms, but the rooms on the piano nobile have been restored with immaculate taste. 'It is true there was a fire and, yes, thieves did smash their way in to steal lead and a priceless fireplace; but that was not the fault of al-Ghazzi. Had he invited the local people in to see the work in progress a lot of the rumours and bad feeling would have been avoided.' Heveningham Hall was commissioned in 1777 by Sir Gerard Vanneck, a merchant banker of Dutch descent; the family had political ambition and the estate was close to the 'rotten' (or pocket) borough of Dunwich. By the time the house was built Sir Gerard had become the member for Dunwich. Sir Robert Taylor, tutor of John Nash, was commissioned to design the house, keeping the shell of the original Queen Anne house. When the exterior was completed, in about 1780, there was a change of architects, the young James Wyatt took over to complete the interior; it has been described as Wyatt's finest work. The tunnel-vaulted entrance hall is one of the finest Georgian rooms in the UK. Some further work is needed to complete the restoration; van Cutsem estimates that this will cost about Pounds 250,000. 'When you consider that this is only about 5 per cent of the value of the property it is not a great deal; most house buyers expect to spend something before they move in,' he said. The hall, its outbuildings and the now tidy gardens are to be opened to the public during July, except on Mondays. Those concerned about its preservation will be able to see the fruits of the late Iraqi's labours.</p>

			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Down with inflation In different times the equity market might have responded more positively to news that inflation had fallen to its lowest level in six years. Since the chancellor appears to have ruled out further cuts in interest rates for the time being, there is less cause for celebration. Besides, part of the fall in the underlying rate to 3.6 per cent from 3.8 per cent reflects unusual softness in food prices. That is unlikely to continue after January when the green pound devaluation will start to be felt. Slowing inflation also suggests that most businesses do not yet have sufficient confidence to push aggressively for price rises. The deflationary effects of recession remain strong. Lower mortgage rates could see headline inflation dip below 2 per cent in the first quarter. The difficult question is what will happen after that. On one view, price pressures from devaluation could still be damped by falling unit labour costs. A low headline rate would also reinforce the government's effort to hold down public sector pay. However the temptation for business to recoup lost margins with price increases will surely become irresistible once real recovery is under way. That is underlined by Ford's price increase this week. The budget, too, could push up prices; the chancellor has already promised to claw back the car tax with additional costs for the motorist. The suspicion lingers that the lower the inflation rate falls now, the sharper will be its later rebound. Perhaps that is why index-linked gilts reacted to November's monthly fall in the retail prices with gains of around a quarter point.</p>

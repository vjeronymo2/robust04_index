			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / People: John I. Jacobs Stuart Bridges, previously a director of Henderson Investment Management, part of fund management group Henderson Administration, has been appointed to the board of John I. Jacobs, the fledgling conglomerate. For the past three years Bridges, 34, has been a fund manager at TR Property Investment Trust. Now he joins Michael Kingshott, 47, who in May quit as chief executive of Sally UK, the ferry operator that he founded, to become managing director of John I. Jacobs. According to Kingshott, he and Bridges 'have already worked closely together on a number of transactions'. Bridges brings 'an expertise in corporate finance and investment management to Jacobs, together with a detailed knowledge of the property sector,' Kingshott says. Jacobs still maintains an old-established firm of shipbrokers, but there are plans to turn it into a what Kingshott calls a 'broadly-based shipping, transport and property group'.</p>

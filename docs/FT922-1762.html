			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture (Week In The Markets): Upbeat gold market moves higher THE CAUTIOUS optimism that has crept into the gold market of late was underlined this week after the Belgian central bank announced on Wednesday that it had sold 202 tonnes out of its reserves. In a bearish market that might have led to the ringing of alarm bells about the possibility of the move being emulated by other central banks. But in their present upbeat mood gold traders greeted news that such a large sale, completed two weeks earlier, had been carried through without disturbing the price trend as a testimonial to the robustness of the market. The London bullion market price, which was already showing a gain of Dollars 2.30 a troy ounce on the week to date when the Belgian sale was announce, edged up 20 cents an ounce on that day and ended the week with an overall rise of Dollars 3.70 at Dollars 343.55 an ounce. The earlier rise was attributed to constructive technical factors and signs that a support area was being established at Dollars 342 an ounce. Some traders noted, however, that short-covering purchases featured prominently in the recent rise and questioned whether that constituted a solid basis for a sustained bull run. At the London Metal Exchange the main features of the week were Monday's action to end the tightening squeeze on nearby supplies of zinc and the consequent reduction in cash premiums. With the cash premium over metal for delivery in three months having built up from zero to Dollars 190 a tonne in two and a half months the exchange stepped in to establish maximum daily premiums for the June/July period starting at Dollars 15 a tonne and ending at Dollars 5. A cash premium is normally associated with supply tightness, but the recent widening of the price gap had coincided with a rapid build-up in the exchange's warehouse stocks. That build-up accelerated dramatically this week with the stockpile, which was already at a record level, rising by an unprecedented 47,500 tonnes to 324,800 tonnes. But this came as no surprise to traders who are expecting even more metal to arrive before the middle of July to feed the squeeze. With the prospects of handsome profits for delivering into the squeezed cash market disappearing holders of long positions have been flooding out of the market since Monday. By yesterday's close the cash price was quoted at Dollars 1,301 a tonne, Dollars 146.50 down on the week, and the premium over three months metal had shrunk to Dollars 103.50 a tonne. Traders said the market was beginning to reflect its poor fundamental background, which had been obscured by the squeeze, and suggested that the three months price might soon test support at Dollars 1,180 a tonne. Tin was again the strongest LME market as more and more consumers gave up waiting for a reaction against the recent sustained price rise. After consolidating last week's gains prices moved to 25-month highs in mid-week and the three months quotation closed yesterday at Dollars 6,762.50 a tonne, up Dollars 270 on the week. Some traders expect an early test of resistance at Dollars 7,000 a tonne for three months tin, but others believe a downside correction is needed if the market is not to become overbought. Aluminium prices extended their decline as hopes of broad-based economic upturn continued to fade. Cash metal lost Dollars 20 on the week at Dollars 1,251 a tonne, the lowest level for four months. At the London Futures and Options Exchange the slide in coffee and cocoa prices continued but sugar futures were a little firmer. The prospect of further producer selling, notably from the Ivory Coast, the biggest producer, sent the cocoa market to fresh 16 1/2 -year lows in mid-week, before it ended with a slightly steadier tone. At yesterday's close September cocoa futures were quoted at Pounds 534 a tonne, Pounds 11 off the low but Pounds 11 down on the week. Coffee traders, appearing to hold out little hope of significant progress towards reviving International Coffee Agreement price support at a producer/consumer meeting in London next week, marked the September futures price down by Dollars 21 on the week to Dollars 706 a tonne. Sugar futures rose in line with the New York market, where buyers were encouraged by constructive chart signals and concern about nearby supply tightness. But profit-taking set in after the July price breached 11 cents a lb on Wednesday. London's October position, which reached Dollars 227.20 a tonne at one point, was quoted at Dollars 221.40 late yesterday, up Dollars 2.40 on the week.  ------------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Thursday's close)  ------------------------------------------- tonnes  ------------------------------------------- Aluminium  +8,475   to   1,278,000 Copper       +975   to     263,750 Lead       +3,025   to     139,700 Nickel       +948   to      30,084 Zinc      +30,875   to     324,800 Tin           -50   to      12,930  -------------------------------------------</p>

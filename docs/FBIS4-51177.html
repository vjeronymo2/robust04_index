			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Zhao Jinyi (6392 6651 0001)] </F>   [Text] Shanghai, 23 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Wu Yan-kun,  a preacher of the Christian Sunday School Association of Taiwan,  was ordered by the Shanghai Public Security Bureau to shorten  his visit to Shanghai. Wu returned to Taiwan by air today.    Wu Yan-kun began his activities in the mainland in 1989, and  he often visited Shanghai, Beijing, Nanjing, and Xian, where he  distributed his own books, "Great Prediction" and "Full  Collection of Savior's Messages," and tapes like "Truth of the  Cross" and "The Revelation" to propagate "God's prediction" that  "the world's doomsday will be in the year of 2018." He spread  such heresy as "our days are numbered, so we should commemorate  the creator in the declining days in order to move onto the path  leading to paradise."    The Shanghai police said that Wu's activities had endangered  social security and had disrupted the order of normal religious  activities and had produced certain evil effects.</p>

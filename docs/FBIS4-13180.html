			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 17 Apr (MENA) -- Egypt has expressed its deep  concern over what is happening in the Bosnian town of Gorazde  and the continuing Serbian aggression against it.    Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa said in a statement today that  this aggression is part of the ethnic cleansing that the Serbs  are carrying out in Bosnia, describing it as a criminal  aggression.    Musa added that reluctance in halting the Serbian aggression  against Gorazde again raises the question of how the influential  countries and NATO stand on these attacks.    He called for adopting immediate, deterrent measures against  the Serbian aggression and to save the city's residents from the  continuing bombardment. He also called for trying those  responsible for the ethnic cleansing.</p>

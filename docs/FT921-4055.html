			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Glynwed If it were needed, there was confirmation of the dire state of the economy from the one large industrial company reporting yesterday. Recovery is nowhere in the picture for Glynwed, but cannot come quickly enough. The 6 per cent rise in its shares was prompted by yet another maintained dividend from an engineering company not earning enough to cover the payment. The market chose to ignore the 64 per cent annual profits fall and the pessimistic trading statement which accompanied the figures, focusing instead on the positive impact expected this year from cost-cutting measures. Given that the group was hit to the tune of Pounds 11m by problems in its copper tubing division, the underlying trading position was perhaps more resilient than expected. One question is whether Glynwed is vulnerable to a predator. The balance sheet is healthy enough, although stated gearing of 40 per cent is more like 50 per cent when finance leases are included. An aggressive conglomerate might be interested in some of the businesses, particularly those like Aga which have strong market niches. The problem is that the shares look expensive on a prospective multiple of 15, assuming nearly doubled earnings this year.</p>

			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Crisis in Russia: Foreign companies take cover - but not flight MR GEOFF RHODES, British Airways manager in Moscow, spent yesterday lying on the floor of his office. Above him, snipers on top of the 20-storey Mezhdunarodnya building exchanged fire with artillery on the ground. Despite the disruption to business, however, foreign companies were cautiously optimistic about the situation yesterday. They also emphasised that operations outside the Russian capital were largely unaffected. The UK computer company International Computers (ICL), which has been operating in Russia for 25 years, said the expectation among staff and customers was that the situation would soon return to normal. Emergency plans to evacuate staff were in place, but things would have to get 'very much worse' before they were implemented, ICL said. The German chemicals group BASF, which has its office very close to the White House, said its 40 staff had stayed away yesterday. However, work on its two joint ventures in Siberia went on as usual. BAT Industries, the UK-based tobacco giant, said: 'We have a staff of 30 in the city, but we have not taken any steps yet to pull them out. They are all staying in their homes for the time being and appear to be safe there.' Flights in and out of Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport were unaffected, BA reported yesterday. Russian airspace, the main air corridor between Europe and Japan, was still open. However, BA staff at the airport were staying at nearby hotels last night rather than risk returning to their homes in the city. One western oil company executive said in London yesterday that production was normal at the company's operations in western Siberia. 'We're just carrying out business as usual,' he said. 'We're in Russia for the long term and believe the government will overcome its present problems.' Most companies said their financial exposure to Russia was strictly limited. The engineering contractor Trafalgar House, which has large contracts with the Russian government, said all its Russian business was covered by advance funding. ICL said that on a worst case, the investment it stood to lose in Russia was only Pounds 2m-Pounds 3m.</p>

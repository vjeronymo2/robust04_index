			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Management: Little taste in flavour of the month Just in case it had escaped your notice, this is the year of the London Taxi. It might sound daft to call a year after a means of transport, yet it is no dafter than calling a month after a management fad. In October, the US will celebrate National Quality Month. For those four weeks there will be general rejoicing over the techniques of total quality management, and newspaper and magazines will be filled with articles on best practice and recent innovations in TQM. On the face of it, Quality Month seems a pointless exercise. TQM is not a new phenomenon that needs promoting, neither is it the sort of worthy project - like planting a tree - that requires a special day devoted to it to spur people into action. Yet Quality Month has become an institution in the US: it has been running for 10 years, and is still going strong. On closer inspection, the event is anything but pointless. It is an opportunity for some big US corporations to tell us how marvellous they are, and for the consultants who have made a killing out of TQM to lay out their stalls. The latest Fortune magazine contains a 40-page special section on the shindig, packed with advertisements for the companies that are sponsoring the event. Ford declares that it gives customers 'the best service on earth'; Coca-Cola shouts that its 'commitment to quality is judged 705m times every day'. Chase Manhattan, General Motors, Goodyear, and many others boast about how long they have been quality devotees, and how dedicated to the movement they are. While as a management tool, quality is old hat and flawed to boot, as an advertising message it is still powerful. Yet as I turned page after page of these advertisements, I wondered if the top of that cycle had been reached. When one company tells us about the quality of its employees, its service or its product and about how hard it tries to delight its customers we may feel impressed. But when everyone is noisily delivering the same message the impact is lost. As far as I know, there is not yet a special month devoted to partnership sourcing. And just as well: last week this fashionable management notion received some serious blows. AT Kearney, the management consultants, has just published a report showing that while 90 per cent of companies are interested in the idea, those who have tried it are sceptical. More momentous, Intel and Compaq Computer, whose business interests as customer and supplier are irrevocably linked, were revealed last week to be at daggers drawn over differences in strategy. Disappointing it may be, surprising it is not. The idea behind partnership sourcing is a pleasing one: customers and suppliers should stop their vain struggle for power and for margin, and instead join hands in product development and marketing for their mutual advancement. But it is a fantasy to expect these partnerships to work effortlessly. All relationships are difficult - one in three marriages ends in divorce, and in the case of husband and wife the liaison is not usually built on a fundamental conflict of interest. In the case of two separate companies, both of which are trying to maximise their own profits and pursue inevitably different strategies, it is amazing that any partnership sourcing arrangements ever work at all. There are plenty of seminars that promise to turn bumbling managers into world-class communicators. But there is a sad lack of more modest courses which accept that inept people are not going to change, and instead offer them advice on how to extricate themselves from the regrettable situations into which they stumble. I felt the absence of any such lessons the other day when I got myself into hot water at the Savoy Grill. I was greeted at the entrance of this famous lunching haunt by the maitre d'. Due to temporary memory failure, I gave him the wrong name of my host. He told me that there was no such booking, and sent me to the hotel's other restaurant, where there was a reservation in the name I had given. For half an hour I sat at someone else's table scattering bread crumbs and sipping the drink I had taken the liberty of ordering. There was some consternation when the real occupants turned up, until an immaculately polite waiter inquired whether I was in fact due to dine with someone of a different name who had been patiently waiting all this time in the Grill. I could see no alternative than to tell my host the whole ugly truth, but with hindsight I wonder whether there was not some more graceful form of escape. I know all those techniques for remembering peoples names like repeating them over and over when you are first told them. But this was a more serious lapse. Maybe if you can't remember the name of a business acquaintance who you know quite well you are beyond the help of any mere management course.</p>

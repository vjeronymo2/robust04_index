			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OFFICIALS BLAST BOEING IMPORT OF B-2 WORKERS;  </P> <P> AEROSPACE: THE FIRM'S CLAIM THAT IT COULDN'T FIND ENOUGH QUALIFIED PEOPLE  LOCALLY IS CALLED 'IRRESPONSIBLE.'  </P> <P> Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, along with other Southern California government  leaders, harshly criticized Boeing Co. on Wednesday for importing about 450  Seattle-based aerospace workers to Palmdale for temporary assignments on the  B-2 Stealth bomber program.  </P> <P> In a letter to Boeing Chairman Frank A. Shrontz, Bradley disputed Boeing's  assertion that it could not locate enough qualified aircraft workers in  Southern California and called the practice "extraordinarily wasteful."  </P> <P> Under Boeing's contracts, the government pays the estimated $10-million cost  for housing and transporting the workers. The Times reported Tuesday that  Boeing had imported the workers under its B-2 bomber contract with Northrop,  which is the prime contractor on the B-2 program.  </P> <P> In another letter to Shrontz, Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Panorama City) said  he was "outraged" by Boeing's assertions about a lack of qualified workers in  Los Angeles and that he finds the big aerospace company's attitude  "irresponsible."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the Los Angeles City Council is considering a motion introduced by  Councilman Nate Holden that urges Boeing to reconsider its practice of  importing workers and instead to hire Los Angeles residents. The motion is  scheduled for a vote Tuesday.  </P> <P> "I find it hard to believe that in a city of well over 3 million people Boeing  was unable to find 450 qualified individuals to fill the positions currently  occupied by Seattle residents," Bradley wrote to Shrontz. "The problem is the  reverse of Boeing's claim; in fact, Los Angeles has more well-trained,  qualified and experienced aerospace workers than the industry can currently  support."  </P> <P> Bradley said Los Angeles expects businesses to give something back to the  community, and that in return for Boeing's use of the city's streets and  utilities the company is "morally obligated to also use our labor force."  </P> <P> Katz offered to coordinate a job fair for Boeing to fill the 450 Palmdale jobs.  "If no one shows, . . . I owe you an apology. Otherwise, Boeing needs to make a  public apology to Southern Californians."  </P> <P> In a second letter, Katz assailed Boeing for hiring Los Angeles workers for  jobs in Seattle at the same time it was transferring workers from Seattle to  here. Katz questioned whether Boeing was using a loophole in federal  regulations to subsidize non-competitive wages being paid to workers in  Seattle.  </P> <P> Asked for comment about the letter to Shrontz, Boeing spokesman Paul Bender  said only, "Mr. Shrontz isn't here." He said he expected that Boeing would  collect some information and send a reply to Bradley.  </P> <P> Holden said in an interview that the aerospace industry in Los Angeles is in a  depression and that local unemployed workers sorely need the Boeing jobs.  Holden said he had also criticized Boeing on Tuesday in a meeting with federal  labor officials who were visiting Los Angeles.  </P></p>

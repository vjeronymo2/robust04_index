			<p><P> May 1, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> TWO MISSING OFF U.S. SUB  </P> <P> Three crew members on a U.S. Navy submarine fell overboard when a wave swept  over the vessel as it conducted surface operations off Japan's southwestern  island of Kyushu, and two are still missing, U.S. military officials said in  Tokyo. One of those who fell from the 2,145-ton vessel was picked up by the  Barbel itself after a search aircraft spotted him, the officials said. His  identity and condition were withheld. The identity of those missing was also  withheld. A spokesman for Japan's Maritime Safety Agency said three Japanese  aircraft and four vessels, including three Japanese patrol boats, have joined  the hunt for the two missing men. According to Jane's Fighting Ships, the  Barbel is a diesel-powered submarine commissioned in 1959 that normally carries  a crew of 85.  </P></p>

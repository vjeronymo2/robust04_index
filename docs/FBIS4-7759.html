			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, 6 Apr--President Lech Walesa, while  receiving Heikki Haavisto, Finland's foreign minister, in the  Belweder on 6 April, expressed Poland's will to expand contacts  with Finland. Earlier, Minister Haavisto was received by Prime  Minister Waldemar Pawlak.    According to the Polish president, Polish-Finnish relations  are "not bad," but they do not make full use of all of the  capabilities of either of the two countries. In his opinion,  Poland and Finland, as medium-size countries, could play a  greater role in international organizations. Lech Walesa said  that Poland and Finland want to join European organizations that  "have proved themselves so far." Finland has already succeeded  in this field. Poland still has a long way to go, the president  said.    The subject of talks with Waldemar Pawlak was economic  cooperation between the two states and trade exchange. The  prime minister conveyed to the Finnish minister an invitation  for the head of the Finnish Government to pay a visit to Poland.</p>

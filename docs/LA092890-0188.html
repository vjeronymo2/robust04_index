			<p><P> September 28, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> FRENCH COUPLE CHARGED AFTER SON DIES IN UNDERWATER BIRTH  </P> <P> A French couple following a fad for underwater childbearing were charged with  manslaughter after their baby drowned at birth in a plastic wading pool, police  in the southern city of Aix-en-Provence said today.  </P> <P> They said the parents -- a 33-year-old nurse and her husband, a 34-year-old  poet -- reported the death Sunday night.  </P> <P> Underwater childbirth, pioneered in France, is said by its supporters to  provide a calm and untroubled start to a baby's life.  </P> <P> Police said the couple installed the inflatable paddling pool in the kitchen of  a friend, a nurse who told them she was not qualified to deliver babies,  especially underwater. The nurse has been charged with failing to help a person  in danger.  </P> <P> But police said the couple had not consulted specialist doctors or organized a  warm place for the baby to spend its first hours after being born in water.  </P> <P> Police said the mother had "an unpleasant experience" during the birth of her  first child eight years ago.  </P> <P> The couple believed the aquatic delivery had been a success, only becoming  concerned an hour later when the baby showed no signs of life.  </P> <P> The couple had decided on a name for the baby boy before he was born -- Noah.  </P></p>

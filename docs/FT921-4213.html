			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / Jobs: At last, an impartial gauge of deep recession - Latest research shows change in the sorts of executives most prone to redundancy AN old rag-trade friend of the Jobs column, called Harry Vos, had a benchmark for gauging the severity of recessions. 'You don't need telling times are bad,' he used to say, 'when they're firing the brothers-in-law.' I pass on his quip with some trepidation because, on recent experience, it will provoke protests. An increasing number of people, especially but not only in America, evidently now deem it 'racist' for gentiles to retail Jewish jokes. So it is fortunate that research has just identified a different benchmark for denoting severe recession, which is racially neutral albeit less funny. Another of its drawbacks is that, as the research concerned is the psychological kind to do with personality traits, the new benchmark needs explanation. Its history starts in the mid-1980s with two studies which applied a standard personality test (the Cattell 16PF) to executives who had lost their jobs. The first was made by Cranfield business school in harness with the Pauline Hyde and Associates outplacement consultancy, the second by the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology with Coutts Career Consultants. The findings were striking. Both studies showed that the executives who had been picked for dismissal at the time were the sort that - to the eyes of an impartial observer, at least - their companies would have done better to keep. The discards were not only more than averagely imaginative, go-getting, forthright and bright intellectually. They were also calmer and self-confident with it. Even so, the research suggested reasons why it was they, rather than colleagues with less sterling qualities, who had been chosen for the chop. The findings showed that their strengths were matched by weaknesses. They were high in forthrightness at the expense of being low in shrewdness, for instance, and imaginative at the cost of lacking canny realism. In sum, it seemed that the redundancy victims of the mid-1980s were typically folk who, although unusually well equipped for executive work in some ways, were bereft of the political abilities on which survival in organisations so often depends. But the research didn't stop there. With more and more of Britain's upper-rankers being thrown out of jobs, psychologists have continued their probings. One in particular is London-based consultant Lea Brindle, who has to date studied some 700 discarded executives. He has discovered that, as the numbers axed have multiplied, the picture of the typical victim seven or so years ago has shaded into a different one. And, to the Jobs column's mind at least, the point at which that change takes place is a useful benchmark for the onset of a truly severe recession. The picture that emerges from standard personality tests on more recent victims is one that has no outstanding feature whatsoever. When compared with the average executive, they are on average just average. You surely don't need telling times are bad when that happens. True, the overall average hides a multitude of individual differences. But the recession has evidently reached a depth where executives have an equal chance of being chosen for the chop regardless of their particular mix of strengths and weaknesses, according to the most commonly used measures of personality at any rate. Accordingly, over recent months Dr Brindle has checked whether the blank face of the average can be enlivened by the use of less standard measures. The main one he has tried is the 'Team Types' analysis, developed by the British training expert Meredith Belbin, which divides people into nine different categories as follows: Co-ordinators. They typically act as the team's 'social leaders', calmly and self-confidently steering the other members in line with broad objectives, but without acting in an overbearing way and not necessarily being officially in charge or outstanding intellectual or creative thinkers. What they are above all is motivators. Shapers. They are the team's 'task leaders', taking it on themselves to ensure their colleagues do the work assigned to them. While outgoing in manner, shapers are personally competitive and don't suffer what they see as fools gladly. Highly motivated individually, they often strike others as arrogant and abrasive. Plants. They act as the team's original thinkers. Intellectually brighter than their colleagues, they generate new ideas at the expense of overlooking detailed realities. Although usually introverted, they are nonetheless thrusting and tend to cause umbrage by criticising others' ways of operating. Resource investigators. They tend to be the most personally likeable members of the group, being sociable and stimulating as they go around collecting information from their many outside contacts and showing instant interest in new possibilities. But while ready to improvise under pressure, they are not original thinkers, and can easily become bored, demoralised and ineffective. Specialists. They are the team's sources of specific knowledge and expertise. Single-mindedly devoted to their chosen field, and working on their own initiative and often imaginatively within it, they tend to be single-minded loners. Evaluators. Logically minded and serious, they are typically viewed as 'cold fish' by their team-mates. Showing little personal motivation, they constantly analyse and nit-pick without offering anything original. Their main value is in stopping colleagues from rushing down blind alleys. Completers. They are the team's worriers, ceaselessly on the lookout for things that might go wrong. Preoccupied with order and detail, they tend to lose sight of the broader scheme of things. Implementors. Outstandingly self-disciplined, they are above all else practical organisers who sort out objectives and pursue them methodically and efficiently, although rarely with imagination. Team workers. They have all the collective virtues, being good communicators as well as highly efficient personally, and sensitive promoters of harmony. As they rarely assert themselves, however, they are apt to be undervalued. That perhaps explains why, of all the nine types covered by Lea Brindle's latest checks, team-workers emerge with the least distinction. The only way in which they stand out from the average is in being poorly paid, a drawback they share with the implementors, completers and evaluators. The best paid, at least in the job they were dismissed from, are the co-ordinators, plants, specialists and resource investigators. Since all of the types studied had received the chop, Dr Brindle was of course unable to compare them with colleagues who had avoided it. All he could examine was how long the rejects had been with the discarding organisation. The shortest lasting were shapers, resource investigators, plants and specialists. The longer stayers were the implementors, completers, evaluators and co-ordinators. But when he checked on those whose own direct boss had been changed within the previous two years, a difference appeared. While the pattern otherwise was the same, co-ordinators changed from long- to short-survivors. When he looked at rejects' speed in finding new jobs, the general pattern tended to reverse. Slower than average were completers and evaluators. Quicker were plants and resource investigators - but not, alas, the short-staying shapers who more than any of the other types ensure that things actually get done even if not always to their colleagues' liking.</p>

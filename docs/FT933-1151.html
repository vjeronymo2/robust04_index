			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Gloomy figures for Japan Japanese consumers' gloomy mood was underlined yesterday by the lowest August car production for 10 years and the 12th consecutive monthly decline in chain store sales, writes William Dawkins from Tokyo. Domestic vehicle production last month fell by 7.4 per cent from the same month in 1992, as domestic and export demand both declined. Half the 10 companies surveyed by the Japan chain stores association reported that business in September was recovering but they were not sure if sales had bottomed out. Year on year, chain store sales fell by 2.1 per cent in August.</p>

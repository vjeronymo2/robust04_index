			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Imro orders record Pounds 100,000 fine FOUR investment companies owned by Hill Samuel, part of the TSB Group, have been fined Pounds 100,000 in the toughest disciplinary action yet taken by the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation, the investment watchdog. The four had admitted 13 offences which together reveal a catalogue of errors or oversight in their administration. Hill Samuel said that no investors' money had been put at risk and that it had co-operated fully with the regulatory body to put right any mistakes. It added that one unnamed manager had been dismissed. The offences related to the way bank accounts were designated and reconciled, the handling of complaints, and a failure to provide Imro with the proper information. The four companies are: Hill Samuel Private Client Management, Hill Samuel Unit Trust Managers, Hill Samuel Investment Services and Hill Samuel PEP Managers. Hill Samuel could not say how many clients they have in all, but said they have 16,000 PEP holders and Pounds 1bn of unit trusts. According to Hill Samuel, the offences were 'procedural and reporting' failures, and did not imply that its administration had broken down. It said its offences were: It failed to designate two bank accounts as client accounts, but had set them up correctly in all other respects. It failed to reconcile the account of about 160 unit trust investors in savings schemes every six months, as required. It failed initially to tell some clients who had complained to it that they had a right to take their cases to a regulatory body, although it did tell them later. It failed to report the departure of a number of fund managers last autumn. However, the redeployment of four fund managers from another part of the group meant no client portfolios were left uncovered. Imro would not comment on the specific offences, but did not disagree with Hill Samuel's statements.</p>

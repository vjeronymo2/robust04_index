			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / More security sought for research careers A RADICAL improvement in the career structure of academic researchers is advocated by the Royal Society, the UK's senior scientific body, in a report released yesterday. It says far too many scientists exist on an uncertain succession of short-term contracts lasting two or three years. They grew in number from 7,500 in 1978 to 19,400 in 1991. The Royal Society says no researcher should have to undertake more than two short-term contracts. After that, they should compete for longer-term fellowships guaranteeing salary and research expenses for at least five years. 'Central to the objective of these fellowships is that they are allocated to individuals, primarily on the basis of individual talent,' the report says. Unlike short-term contracts, fellowships could be carried to any academic institution. The proposal would require co-operative action by the five research councils and the Universities Funding Council to create at least 500 fellowships. The Future of the Science Base. Royal Society.

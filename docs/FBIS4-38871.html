			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Nikolay Gritchin report: "From Chechnya Back to Government </F> in Moscow?"]    [Excerpts] Groznyy-Moscow -- The tragic circumstances  surrounding the attempt on the life of Chechnya's President  Dzhokhar Dudayev last Friday (during which Chechnya's internal  affairs minister, his deputy, and his chauffeur died) are linked  by analysts first and foremost with the authorities' vigorous  actions to neutralize terrorists. When analyzing the situation  more profoundly it is necessary to take due account of the fact  that Russia has confirmed its intention to hold talks with  Chechnya at the very highest level, even though this aroused the  discontent of forces opposed to Dudayev. And, last but by no  means least: Former Supreme Soviet Speaker R. Khasbulatov  through his actions is declaring ever more ardently that he is a  true politician, ready to involve himself in Chechen politics.    Traces of Former Russian Federation Supreme Soviet Chairman  R. Khasbulatov's stay in Groznyy are hard to find. It was back  in mid-April that I spotted the most recent mention of him in  the leading republic newspaper ICHKERIYA. His trips around the  republic, his visit to the mosques, the restraint of his  speeches, and meanderings regarding his intention to stand back  from the dirty business of politics and move into science,  clearly placated Dudayev's team, usually extremely politicized  and wary in respect of opponents.    M. Udugov, chief of the republic Department of Information  and the Press, on the day prior to the 25 May publication in  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA of an interview with the former speaker of  the Russian Parliament on his return to Moscow, assured me that  Khasbulatov still remains in Chechnya. While another of  Dudayev's close comrades in arms resolutely consigned his famous  compatriot to political oblivion. Obviously he was a little  premature. Breaking the vow of silence, the erstwhile prisoner  of Lefortovo gave the current regime in Groznyy an unequivocal  indication that he will outlive it. [passage omitted]  <H5>  To the Political Olympus -- In a Roundabout Way </H5>   The emerging prospects for Khasbulatov's return to power  cannot fail to alarm the Russian president too. There is an  awareness in the Kremlin that a second coming to the political  Olympus by the speaker of the former Supreme Soviet is most  likely to come via a roundabout route. The post of legitimate  leader of Chechnya constitutes a sturdy launch pad for a return  to top-level Russian politics. Experts suggest that, once on  this platform, Khasbulatov will be able to convince his Chechen  entourage of the need to sign a treaty with Russia, that he will  be able to stage elections in the republic for the Russian  Federation State Duma and Federation Council, present his  candidacy for the Federation Council, and become a member of it.    For B. Yeltsin this would mean an inevitable strengthening  of  confrontation in the federal organs of power. The rise of  national-patriotic sentiment, notably in the deputies' corps,  makes the prospect of Khasbulatov's being elected Russian  Federation president or head of the Russian Government unlikely  in the immediate post-Yeltsin period. But his failure to  countenance modern-day presidential authority in Moscow, which  is reliant, to use his expression, "solely on the boys in  uniform," will probably be exploited by the opposition in order  to secure victory over Yeltsin and his supporters in future  elections.    Such a prospect, in the opinion of a number of analysts,  has provided additional impetus for the Kremlin's active quest  for ways to settle the protracted conflict with Chechnya. The  "Khasbulatov factor" reinforces preconditions for elaborating a  mutually acceptable decision at the meeting between the two  presidents. Experts assert that the Kremlin will probably  propose several versions of a Russian-Chechen treaty. At the  same time the Russian-Tatar agreement, which from Dudayev's  viewpoint is unacceptable to Chechnya, may be seen merely as an  example to be imitated in the most general sense -- that is, as  an example of a weighty solution to an insoluble dispute by  bringing into circulation new political-judicial symbols and  concepts, allowing the sides to get around discrepancies in  their positions "without losing face."    In particular, national politicians consider it possible for  Chechnya to devise some kind of status or level of soverienty  unique in contemporary Russian practice (like the Portuguese  "free affiliated state"), which, while preserving the external  attributes of the Republic of Chechnya's state independence  (with all the concomitant symbols, as is partly taking place  even in respect of "regular" republics within the Russian  Federation), would at the same time guarantee the most  propitious opportunities for Chechnya's reintegration into the  Russian political and economic area.    The implementation of this version, however, presupposes the  achievement of prior agreement on this question between the two  branches of power in Moscow, without which the presidential side  may find itself subject to harsh criticism in the State Duma and  the Federation Council for "capitulating" and "flouting the  Constitution." The formation of favorable public opinion both  in Chechnya and in Russia as regards concluding a compromise  agreement could be aided by the establishment of close  cooperation between the internal affairs bodies of the Chechen  Republic and the Russian Federation in the fight against  organized crime. The joint arrest of the terrorists who took a  bus and its passengers hostage in Mineralnyye Vody could be  considered a good start to this process. Even prior to the  conclusion of a treaty, the aim could be furthered by a  guarantee of the safety of rail and road traffic on Chechen  territory, either by the Chechen authorities on their own or  jointly with the Russian internal troops, as well as mutual  guarantees of the safety and equality of the Russian-speaking  population in Chechnya and the Chechen communities in Russia.</p>

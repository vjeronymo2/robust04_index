			<p><P> October 26, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE BEAT: SARGENT DOUBLE BILL 'FURY' AT THE OLIO  </P> <P> The generic '90s mythic hero of Michael Sargent's striking plays, "Big Boy" and  "I Hate" -- young, beautiful and passionless -- pops up again in his one-act  "Rat Songs," the second half of "Fury" at the Olio Theatre. This time he's  lusted after by his roommate in a youth detention center, his partner in a  daring escape and a Genet-esque search for the siren rats of his friend's  imagination.  </P> <P> But Sargent's aim is not as sharp here. Other characters seem totally  extraneous and don't advance the central theme. Kergan Edwards' direction helps  -- as would stronger focus -- and Eric Close and Michael Vaccaro perfectly  capture the emotional hunger and desperate search for identity of the hero  Robbie and his doomed friend.  </P> <P> The opener is another Sargent one-act, "When Esther Saw the Light," but it's  derivative and silly, far from Sargent at his best.  </P> <P>  At 3709 Sunset Blvd., Silver Lake; Thursdays through Saturdays, 8 p.m.; ends  Nov. 17. $15; (213) 466-1767.  </P> <P> T.H. McCULLOH  </P></p>

			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Wetherspoon seeks listing JD WETHERSPOON, the London pubs operator which yesterday announced first half pre-tax profits ahead from Pounds 432,000 to Pounds 1.01m, is to seek a Stock Exchange listing towards the end of the year, writes Philip Rawstorne. It has appointed Kleinwort Benson to float 35 per cent of the company to raise about Pounds 15m. Mr Tim Martin, the managing director who founded the company in 1979, said the flotation would help to accelerate expansion. During the past 13 years, the company has grown from one free house to an estate of 37 pubs with a turnover in the six months to January 25 of Pounds 9.6m. Many of the pubs have been converted from shops and car showrooms. One was formerly a bank; another was a chapel. They are run on traditional lines, offering a wide range of real ales and a music-free environment. All of the pubs offer one beer at 99p a pint compared with the national average of 134p. The company has invested Pounds 6m in seven new outlets during the past six months and plans to open another five pubs in the next two months.</p>

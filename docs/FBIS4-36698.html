			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by 'Ali al-Salih: "Abu-Mazin To Remain in Tunis With </F> Abu-al-Lutf and Abu-Mahir"]    [Excerpt] London -- PLO Executive Committee member Mahmud  'Abbas (Abu-Mazin) has denied that a decision has been taken to  close PLO offices in Tunis. He said: "That is untrue."    Reports said the day before yesterday that Palestinian  President Yasir 'Arafat had issued a decision to close all PLO  offices in Tunis before 15 June on the occasion of what was  termed the "return to the homeland."    Abu-Mazin told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT over the telephone: It is  not known yet which establishments will remain [in Tunis].  However, he expected the Political Department, headed by Faruq  Qaddumi (Abu-al-Lutf), to keep its offices in Tunis.    Asked about the fate of his department (International  Relations), Abu-Mazin, architect of the Oslo accord, said that  "it could be abolished or incorporated into the Political  Department or maybe moved to the inside [the self-rule areas]."  He went on: "But I will not move to the self-rule areas at the  moment. I will remain in Tunis."    As for Fatah Central Committee member Muhammad Ghunaym  (Abu-Mahir), he said in this context: All offices, except those  related to the Political Department, the Returnees Department  headed by 'Abdallah Hurani (who resigned from the Executive  Committee), and the general staff, have been or will be closed.  I mention in particular the offices related to the security and  military services, most of whose cadres and staff have left for  the self-rule areas.    Abu-Mahir said that the departments concerned with external  action and the military forces will remain in Tunis. "Other  departments will move to the inside [the self-rule areas]." On  his own position, Abu-Mahir said: "We might move from Tunis  after a period of time, but not to the inside." But he declined  to name the area to which he is going to move. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Zuraidah Ibrahim] </F>   [Text] Inflation this year is not expected to exceed 5.5  percent and is likely to be even lower with the many offsets for  the Goods and Services Tax [GST], said Mr. Yeo Cheow Tong  yesterday. The trade and industry minister gave the assurance  after noting that the underlying inflation rate was around 2.5  percent and assuming a full 3 percent additional rate due to the  GST. "And since we have a lot of offsets, it is likely to be  below 5.5 percent," he added. Offsets to cushion the impact of  the GST include rebates on service and conservancy charges and  tax cuts.    Mr. Yeo made this assessment in reply to MPs who expressed  worry last week that GST-induced inflation could lead to a price  spiral. Some had predicted inflation of 6 percent, while others  feared it would hit 9 percent, more than thrice last year's 2.4  percent.    Yesterday, the minister assured the House repeatedly that  the  new tax, to be launched next month, will not lead to high  inflation.    He cited a 1986 International Monetary Fund study of 35  countries which introduced GST and found that 29 only had a  one-off rise in inflation. The rate went back to normal  subsequently. For many, the increase was also lower than the tax  rate.    Addressing calls to combat profiteering, he revealed that  the  reactivated Committee on Profiteering and Inflation had met  major retailers to gauge how they would respond to the GST.  Many said they would absorb the tax for most of their  lower-priced items and pledged not to raise prices by more than  3 percent for higher-priced goods. On the possibility of people  taking advantage of the GST to jack up prices, he said the keen  competition in Singapore's very open economy with no supply  shortages left little scope for this. But, he added it was also  difficult to determine what constituted profiteering.    Price differences occurred all the time at different places.  As long as people were willing to pay, who could say shops were  profiteering, he asked. It could only exist if consumers had no  choice. Noting that the government was nevertheless mindful of  the public's concern, he cited several other measures, including  the Department of Statistics' regular survey of hawker prices.  Its finding so far: Only 4 percent have raised prices. "So  this concern about runaway prices, therefore, has no basis at  all," he said.    The department, he added, will assist the Consumers'  Association of Singapore [Case] by helping it to publish a list  of the best and worst deals for consumers. The latter will be a  blacklist, similar to the Singapore Tourist Promotion Board's  blacklist of shops for tourists, he said, adding that Case  should be bold in protecting the consumer.    He also said that those who ganged up to form a monopoly  would face the consequences of the Price Control Act. Under the  act, the government can set maximum prices for goods which it  thinks suppliers are profiteering from.    Mr. Yeo's final message: The comprehensive measures could  only work if consumers exercised their rights. "We have to teach  the retailers that greed does not pay, and the consumer is in  the best position to do that."    Parliament passed the Trade and Industry Ministry's budget  and began scrutiny of the Ministry of Information and the Arts.  Debate continues today.</p>

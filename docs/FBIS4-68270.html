			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Major General (Retired) Vadim </F> Makarevskiy, Russian Academy of Sciences World Economics and  International Relations Institute Disarmament and Security  Department, under rubric "We and Our Expectations: Militaria":  "Military Reform Is Proceeding, But More Slowly Than One Would  Like"]    [Text] Military reform in Russia is not someone's  whim. It is an objective necessity, a response to changes which  occurred in Europe and the former Soviet Union over the last 5-6  years.    Back during 1989-1990, when sharp debates were going on  about  professionalization of the Army, when former heads of the  Ministry of Defense flatly denied the need for conducting  military reform, it essentially already had begun...    Its beginning was marked by the withdrawal of Soviet troops  from Warsaw Pact member countries. Events were accelerated  further by the dissolution of this military-political  organization, reaching their culmination in 1991, when the  Soviet Union itself disintegrated and the Russian Armed Forces  were deprived of a strategic second echelon (the Baltic,  Belarus, Ukraine). Thus, Russia's strategic troop grouping had  to be created anew, and this, strictly speaking, is one of the  main components of military reform.    Attempts to defend unified Union Armed Forces and then  create  unified CIS forces proved fruitless, and so establishment of a  Russian Army and simultaneously the planned reform of existing  military structures began in May 1992. The basic goal of  military reform is a quality improvement in the Army under new  geostrategic conditions, with consideration of Russia's new  military doctrine and the reduction in troop numerical strength  to optimum size. Its realization (difficult in itself) is taking  place against the background of a sequence of problems, each of  which also is rather complicated. It is the scheduled (and  sometimes also unscheduled, but in any case massive) withdrawal  of troops from abroad, the significant reduction in authorized  personnel strength, the great personnel shortage in the troops,  destruction of excessive combat equipment under the Paris  Agreements, and conversion of military industry.    The principal difficulties of Armed Forces reform lie in  this  interlacing of problems being resolved simultaneously in a  country experiencing political and economic crisis. They are  exacerbated by the situation in countries of the near  abroad--military conflicts in the Caucasus, Central Asia and  Moldova, into which Russian troops have been drawn in one way or  another.    The military reform plan was designed for 8-9 years and  broken into three stages. We now are in the second stage  (1993-1995).    Its task of creating a new strategic grouping of troops  should be completed next year.    The next military reform task is to upgrade the intrabranch  structure of troops in connection with the change in their  stationing and the reduction in overall numerical strength of  the Armed Forces to the level of two million persons, and to  upgrade weapon and command and control systems (in particular,  this means a transition from the "army-division" system to a  "corps-brigade" system).    A reduction in troop numerical strength requires improved  professional training of personnel. A serious problem arose over  troop manpower acquisition, which can be solved only by  combining a conventional call-up with acceptance of soldiers on  a volunteer, contract basis. This problem is difficult to  resolve. There are difficulties with the call-up because of the  great indulgences established at one time by the former Supreme  Soviet (essentially only one-fifth of the overall number of  potential draftees enter the Army). Not everything is simple  with acceptance under contract as well. The numerical strength  of NCO's and contract privates was supposed to be 30 percent in  1993, but this is only half fulfilled. On the one hand, there is  a clear lack of funds. On the other hand, contract personnel  want both to receive a decent salary and to have easier  service--basically logistic and maintenance positions are being  filled. Considerably fewer are willing to take combat positions.    Creation of mobile forces is an important element of  military  reform. At first the thought was to create two large groupings  of mobile forces--Immediate Reaction Forces as a first echelon  ready to act in a matter of hours, and Rapid Deployment Forces  as a second echelon consisting of formations with heavier  equipment (the numerical strength of each grouping is up to  100,000-150,000 persons). It was planned to establish these  forces in two military districts, Volga and Ural. The idea of  creating such large mobile forces was connected with the fact  that Russia now is incapable of keeping large troop groupings  along all its immense borders. They began creating the mobile  forces in 1993, but the initial plan now is being transformed.  It is possible that the central mobile forces will be of lesser  makeup, but on the other hand small mobile forces will be  established in all military districts, above all Moscow, North  Caucasus and others.    Of course, there were mobile forces in the makeup of the  Soviet Armed Forces previously as well--above all these were the  Airborne Troops and units of the Naval Infantry. The novelty of  the present mobile forces concept lies in the fact that they  must be interbranch in nature, have a wider range of weapons and  have the capability of performing major operational-strategic  missions independently.    One other element of military reform is a reform of troops  on  a territorial basis. By 1995 it is planned to establish the  Joint Territorial Command headed by a commander-in-chief (in the  rank of deputy minister of defense) in Komsomolsk-on-Amur. The  goal is more effective command and control of all forces and  assets in the Far East, including not only the Ground Troops,  but also the Pacific Fleet, Air Force, Air Defense, and if  necessary the Border Troops and Internal Security Forces. Then  it is planned to set up such a command in Ulan-Ude for  centralizing command and control in the Transbaykal and in  Siberia. Reform of military structures in the North Caucasus was  announced even earlier. This means that territorial commands  operating within limits of certain territories of Russia and  heading up the reform of Russian troops are being established in  place of previous commanders-in-chief of axes, which in terms of  operational purpose basically were aimed at the West. (They  supported the command element of border military districts and  groups of forces abroad). One can see in this the beginning of  reorganization of branch structures of the Armed Forces. But a  reform of branch structures is a very complicated matter. For  example, an attempt to create unified Air Defense Forces based  on Air Defense Troops and the Air Force in Ukraine ended in  failure. The new command and control entity which had been  established, numbering 250 generals, officers and warrant  officers, was disbanded and everything returned to square one.    Finally, one of the most important tasks of military reform  is to elevate the professional level of Armed Forces personnel.  But as we already said, there are considerable difficulties here  which cannot be overcome in a year or two. Draftees must come  into the Army better trained and more mature. The viewpoint of a  number of authoritative military persons who insist on raising  the draft age to 19-21 is quite correct. Eighteen years is too  "green" an age for military service. A draftee should begin  service no earlier than age 19 and a volunteer from age 21,  while also having all other qualities of a professional soldier  (appropriate physical development, necessary level of education  and so on).    There is a mass of objective and subjective difficulties in  the path of military reform in Russia. I will risk declaring  that not one major military power of modern time, nor Russia  itself in the past, conducted military reforms under such  difficult conditions in which the present Russian Federation now  finds itself.    Reform unquestionably is under way, however, although not as  fast or as vigorously as one would like. But the important thing  still lies ahead: With a favorable development of events, a  qualitative renewal of Russian Federation Armed Forces will  materialize no earlier than 1996.</p>

			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE  </P> <P> AIRPLANE UPDATE: Marty Balin has rejoined the retooled Jefferson Airplane,  which has signed with Epic Records. The lineup now includes all of the key  players of the original Airplane, which shot to stardom in 1967 -- Balin, Grace  Slick, Paul Kantner, bassist Jack Casady and guitarist Jorma Kaukonen.  </P> <P> The group announced its plans to regroup two months ago, but Balin wasn't on  board at that point. But he and his former band mates have since come to terms.  The group is recording its first Epic album in a Los Angeles studio, sharing  production chores with producer Ron Nevison. It's the first time that all of  the Airplane principals have been in the studio together since 1972 when they  cut "Long John Silver."  </P> <P> Starship, which evolved in 1985 out of Jefferson Starship -- a spinoff of the  original Airplane -- carries on, still signed to RCA. None of its members were  around in the Airplane days. The longest-serving member is Craig Chaquico, who  joined in 1974.  </P> <P> There is talk of an Airplane tour to coincide with the expected release of the  new album in August.  </P></p>

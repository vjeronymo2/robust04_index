			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Shanayev] </F>   [Text] Vladikavkaz, 21 Apr -- The upcoming parliamentary  hearings in the Federation Council and the meeting of the  Russian Security Council, both of which will discuss the  situation in the conflict zone, are yet another attempt at  achieving a peaceful settlement of relations between North  Ossetia and Ingushetia, Akhsarbek Galazov, president of the  Republic of North Ossetia, said today in an interview with the  ITAR-TASS correspondent before leaving by air for Moscow.    Akhsarbek Galazov said that North Ossetia is extremely  interested in establishing normal relations with all its  neighbors in the North Caucasus region and Transcaucasia. But  the multinational people of the republic will not accept  strong-arm methods to resolve these questions. Nor should one  force the process involving the return of refugees to villages  in Prigorodnyy Rayon. This complicated problem must be resolved  by conciliation commissions on the basis of the Kislovodsk  Agreements.    Speaking of the upcoming signing of the agreement on  achieving civic accord in Russia, the republic's president  stressed that North Ossetia supports the ideas of this document  that are aimed at consolidating all the healthy forces in  society.    However, Akhsarbek Galazov noted that "the sides are  appealing to national movements and parties to declare a  moratorium on putting forward demands for changes to be made to  borders and existing administrative divisions." It is necessary  to take off the agenda the issue of redrawing borders in the  region. Galazov said that this could lead to a new tragedy not  only in the North Caucasus, but also in the south of Russia.</p>

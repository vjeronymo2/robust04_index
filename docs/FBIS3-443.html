			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Prime Minister Faustin Birindwa yesterday  presided over the weekly cabinet meeting. [passage omitted] On  the state of the nation, the cabinet observed that there is  effective calm throughout the whole country. The cabinet  however condemned the fallacious statement made by a politician  to the effect that there are disturbances in the northwestern  part of the country. Contrary to that politician's false  allegation, the government asserts that there is no detachment  of the Special Presidential Division in that part of the country  or a disturbing presence of the Sudanese Army on the Sudan-Zaire  border.    The government deplores the fact that at the time when all  Zairians are awaiting definite solutions to our problems from  the Palais du Peuple, some fellow citizens in search of the  sensational are taking the liberty to sow doubt in the minds of  the people for unavowed reasons, and are systematically deriding  our Armed Forces with outrageous statements.    In the face of such culpable irresponsibility, the  government  wishes to remind everyone that henceforth any statement  discrediting our Armed Forces will be punished with the  strongest force.

			<p><P> May 1, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> YELTSIN RECOVERING FROM SURGERY  </P> <P> Maverick Moscow communist Boris Yeltsin came through emergency surgery for a  herniated disk in fine shape and should leave the hospital by the end of this  week, the Soviet lawmaker's doctor said today.  </P> <P> Yeltsin, who had complained of stabbing back pains and numbness in his right  foot Monday, was doing "very well" after the 90-minute operation, said Dr.  Josep Llobet Tapies, who performed the surgery.  </P> <P> The neurosurgeon described the 59-year-old Yeltsin, who was recovering in an  intensive care ward, as a "strong patient" who should be released from the  hospital in three to five days.  </P> <P> El Pais, Spain's largest daily, quoted the animated and cheerful Yeltsin as  instructing his doctor, "Operate, because it wouldn't be good for the future  president of the U.S.S.R. to have a paralyzed foot."  </P></p>

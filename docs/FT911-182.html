			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / UK Company News: GKN plans French joint venture in AFV market RATIONALISATION of the European armoured fighting vehicles market accelerated yesterday as GKN Defence, the UK-based defence subsidiary of GKN, and Giat Industries of France announced a possible joint-venture in the medium armoured vehicle market. The two companies have signed a memorandum of understanding to study the feasibility of common solutions for the French and British markets. The agreement, if successful, could secure GKN's future as a manufacturer of armoured fighting vehicles (AFVs). 'With manufacturers as diverse as GKN, VSEL, USH's Alvis, Royal Ordnance and Vickers, the British AFV market is grossly oversupplied,' explains Mr Sash Tusa, a defence analyst at Robert Fleming. 'But in the long term, this deal could open up the continental market to GKN and provide economies of scale for joint Franco-British manufacture.' The move follows encouragement from Mr Alan Clark, the defence procurement minister, for increased co-operation in acquiring defence equipment between France and the UK. The two countries have similar requirements for equipment which can be used outside the Nato area and which is suitable for export. The policy's aim is to reduce procurement costs. Giat's decision to forge links with GKN follows a nine-month flurry of alliances and expansion since it was made an independent group by the French government last year. In recent months, the group has reshaped the French AFV sector by signing joint development and manufacturing accords with the other French AFV companies, Creusot-Loire - an engineering subsidiary of Usinor-Sacilor, the steelmaker - and Renault Vehicules Industriels, the truck-making unit of Renault. Mr Pierre Chiquet, Giat's chairman, said yesterday that the accord was in keeping with the 'pattern of Europeanising armament land programmes and companies'.</p>

			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Siemens UK sees recovery The UK subsidiary of Siemens, the German electronics giant, forecast a strong recovery in profits this year, in contrast to last week's surprise warning from the parent company of a fall in profits of up to 15 per cent worldwide. UK sales of semiconductors were up 60 per cent last year, in the context of a market increase of 40 per cent, said Mr Juergen Gehrels, UK chief executive. 'Semiconductors are an economic indicator, an early warning system,' he said. 'This is further proof that the UK is coming out of recession.' In the first quarter of the current year, semiconductor sales had doubled. In the year to end-September, Siemens UK achieved its target of Pounds 1bn sales, 14 per cent up on the year before. Including the completion of the Killingholme power station, valued at Pounds 245m, sales reached Pounds 1.25bn. The UK operation was marginally profitable overall, Siemens said, before including profits from its minority holding in the GPT telecommunications business. Mr Gehrels said some divisions had remained in loss, including Siemens Plessey Systems and the Osram lighting business. However, the Siemens Nixdorf computer business returned to profit. All divisions would be in profit this year, he said. ACT Group has sold ACT Cablestream, its network communications solutions, products and services business, to Siemens UK. The sale fits in with the group's strategy to focus on its financial software products and software and services activities. Consideration is Pounds 5m, of which Pounds 4.5m was paid on completion with an adjustable balance, relating to net assets, of up to Pounds 2.5m.</p>

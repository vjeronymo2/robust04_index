			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Exploration/El Oro The Exploration Company, which despite its title operates as an investment dealing company, lifted first half profits to Pounds 1.04m pre-tax, against Pounds 827,000. The outcome, for the six months to June 30, reflected sharply higher profits from investments. This offset lower returns from associates, dividends, rents and interest. Earnings per stock unit improved from 4.89p to 6.09p. The associated El Oro Mining &amp; Exploration - also an investment dealing company - reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 766,000 (Pounds 751,000) for the same period, giving earnings of 12.06p (11.73p) per share.</p>

RAIDERS  </P> <P> The mayor of Los Angeles has formed a committee of businessmen and others to  keep professional football in the city.  </P> <P> The other California cities have gotten the bidding for a sports franchise into  the $200-million range, and the end is apparently not in sight. The enlightened  civil leaders seem hellbent on providing an area for a handful of athletes  while muddling about on what steps to take to provide adequate housing for the  working poor. Let the games begin.  </P> <P> RUSS MARLETT  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

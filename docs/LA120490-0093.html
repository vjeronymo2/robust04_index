			<p><P> December 4, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEWS;  </P> <P> 'BEST HOTEL' A CINEMA VERITE LOOK AT SKID ROW  </P> <P> "The Best Hotel on Skid Row," an "America Undercover" segment airing on HBO at  9:30 tonight, is a simple, straightforward look at the life led by a few of the  residents of downtown L.A.'s Madison Hotel.  </P> <P> In this case, simple and straightforward is by no means bland -- "Hotel" is an  engrossing, cinema verite study of an ignored other world, a shadow culture  within our city limits.  </P> <P> The Madison, an ugly, blocky building on the outside, features small, fairly  clean rooms for $8.20 a night. The hotel is an oasis for some, a last stop  before the almost inevitable fall to the streets for others. As poet Charles  Bukowski -- whose gravelly voice and streetwise air makes him a perfect  narrator for this slice of grit -- says at one point: "You can have a room for  a day . . . or a lifetime."  </P> <P> Bukowski's narration sets the tone -- and sets up the interviews with the  tenants, all identified with their name and room number. There's hooker and  heroin addict Becky, Gary the lonely day laborer, the lovesick John and the  less-than-thrilled object of his affection, Debbie. We see Becky working the  street and Gary on a pick-up job as a truck swamper, but mostly we see the  residents, drifters all, sitting in their rooms, with their  25-cents-per-15-minutes TVs droning on in the background.  </P> <P> There is little relief beyond the comfort they sometimes give each other; all  yearn for companionship to ease their pain.  </P> <P> One caveat: "Hotel" is skillfully done but one man's cinema verite can be  another's shallow voyeurism. "Hotel" feeds off of its subjects at the same time  it celebrates them.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'On Fire': Solid Primer on Surviving One  </P> <P> "On Fire: A Family Guide to Fire Safety," airing at 10:30 tonight on KCET  Channel 28, finds Henry Johnson, a fire and safety specialist in the Los  Angeles Fire Department, doing for fires what he did for earthquakes in last  year's "Surviving the Big One": delivering an entertaining, comprehensive  primer on how to cope with a disaster.  </P> <P> Johnson's low-key style is perfect for this type of documentary, which could  easily become a dry lecture. Although he's more restrained than he was in "Big  One," writer-narrator-host Johnson delivers a great deal of valuable  information. (Valuable information in a poor time slot: Why did KCET schedule  this so late at night?)  </P> <P> And, as he did in "Big One," Johnson repeatedly stresses that the key to  survival lies in proper preparation. "On Fire" examines coping at three  different locations: home, work, travel. The show uses fire re-creations to  make dramatic points. Less-dramatic, but equally necessary, are the home,  office and hotel walk-throughs -- just when you think you've heard all this  before, Johnson will mention some fact or tip that rings true for your  individual situation.  </P> <P> Although choppy at times, "On Fire" is a solid guide to preventing, controlling  and surviving a fire. It's not a pretty topic but it is a must-see -- and might  just help you and your family survive a nightmare. MARTIN ZIMMERMAN  </P></p>

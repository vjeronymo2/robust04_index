			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / Minister to answer to Hualon inquiry Mr Lin Chen-kuo, Taiwan's finance minister, and Mr Day Linin, chairman of the securities and exchange commission, are to appear before the legislature's finance committee today for questioning. There have been calls for their resignations for their alleged part in a share market controversy that sent stock prices plummeting 14.7 per cent in a week. Mr Ma Ying-jeou, justice minister, told the legislature yesterday that the government would crack down on illegal share trading activities, and those responsible for the defaults crisis would be brought to justice. The episode erupted last Wednesday when Hung Fu Securities, controlled by the Hualon Group, bounced a cheque to the Taiwan Stock Exchange Corp, triggering a rash of cheque defaults totalling TDollars 7.6bn (Pounds 182m). Mr Lin and Mr Day will be asked to explain why they did not begin earlier to investigate suspicious trading in shares of Imperial Hotel, controlled by the Hualon group. The price of shares in the hotel rose from TDollars 75 to TDollars 402 over 10 months, sparking concerns among underground financiers lending to Hualon's chief, Mr Oung Ta-ming, which led them to withdraw funds. Investigations could show that legislators, big companies and even government officials figured among Mr Oung's financial links. The three main political parties yesterday announced party members found to be involved would be punished. Officials made a surprise raid on Mr Oung's headquarters late on Thursday night and seized documents relating to the share crisis. Mr Oung's chief trader and financial manager, Ms Li Hsiu-fen, was detained last Thursday morning as she tried to flee the country and has been held incommunicado since. Ms Li was responsible for Mr Oung's share trading activities as well as negotiating with the underground financiers who backed him.</p>

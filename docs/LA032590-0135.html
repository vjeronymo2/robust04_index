			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: THE WICKED PAVILLION BY DAWN POWELL (VINTAGE: $8.95)  </P> <P> A slyly satirical tale of the New York art world during the early '50s, before  skyrocketing prices completed its corruption. Dawn Powell offers a gallery of  tongue-in-cheek portraits from that rarefied milieu: the successful artists and  the artists manques; a vulgar patron who expects a sexual return for her  subsidies; shady dealers; an assortment of critics, drones and hangers-on.  </P> <P> The Cafe Julien, a tiny gourmet restaurant on Washington Square, provides the  bond for this diverse assortment of self-styled Bohemians.  </P> <P> But the real hero of the story is Manhattan, when it was a cleaner and safer  place to live. Powell obviously is aware that her love for the city and its  artistic demimonde is more foolish than wise, but she never lets that  realization spoil her nostalgic evocation of a more innocent era.  </P></p>

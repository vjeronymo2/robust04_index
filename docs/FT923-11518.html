			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Extensive disposals aid First Technology FIRST TECHNOLOGY, which supplies crash dummies and safety sensors to the car industry, said extensive disposals helped it make pre-tax profits of Pounds 639,000 in the year to April 30, against a Pounds 3.03m loss. The recession-hit group's shares, which crashed from a peak of 500p in 1990, yesterday closed 3p higher at 59p. The group sold nine non-core businesses and closed one during the year, reducing turnover from Pounds 37.3m to Pounds 27.8m. Earnings per share of 2.4p compared with losses of 14.7p, but the final dividend is again passed, resulting in a nil distribution for the year (1p). A capital reorganisation is planned and it is intended to resume dividends in the current year. Net borrowings fell from Pounds 9.5m to Pounds 6m, leaving year-end gearing at 150 per cent. Further significant reductions are expected this year. Banking facilities with Barclays and National Bank of Detroit will be reviewed in December. The group is confident it will be able to negotiate support at much lower cost than last year, when there was an exceptional charge for professional fees of Pounds 365,000. COMMENT First Technology has made a good start on the road to recovery, but a lot of fingers have been burnt since the not-so-distant glory days when the shares topped 500p. The company will have to rely on cash generation to reduce further its debt burden, but should have no great difficulty in cutting gearing to about 80 per cent next year. Mr Westlake argues as persuasively as ever that increasing consumer concern with car safety will prove good for business. Forecast pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.5m next year put the shares on a prospective multiple of just under 8. At that level, they obviously have attractions as a recovery play. However, more safety-conscious investors may wish to await the resumption of dividends before leaping aboard.</p>

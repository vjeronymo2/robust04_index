			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Berisford shareholders give go-ahead for Magnet takeover Shareholders of Berisford International, the former commodity and property group, voted in favour of the Pounds 56m reverse takeover of Magnet, the kitchen and joinery manufacturer and retailer, at a special meeting yesterday. The meeting also approved the increase in share capital necessary for the 1-for-2 rights issue at 120p which is financing the purchase. Mr John Sclater, chairman, said the acquisition was 'an ideal first step in Berisford's growth strategy'. He said it was 'the best news' he had been able to announce since becoming chairman in 1990 and was the 'first step in building a successful conglomerate'. One shareholder suggested the rights price was at too small a discount to the 128p suspension price. Mr Sclater said that when the shares resumed trading - this morning - he had 'a suspicion you may have a nice surprise'. Brokers expect the shares to open at a significant premium to the suspension price. The same shareholder was concerned that the move represented a diversification from Berisford's old core business. Mr Alan Bowkett, chief executive, said he was pleased to say that 'no-one on your board has experience of the old core business'. He said Berisford was 'a new company going forward in a new business'. The EGM was preceded by the AGM, when Mr Sclater said that trading was in line with budget. Ketlon, the automotive components subsidiary had 'just received a large inaugural order from Honda'. The recent earthquake in Los Angeles had not injured employees or damaged Berisford's property there. However, 'it is clear there will be some disruption to business over the coming months'.</p>

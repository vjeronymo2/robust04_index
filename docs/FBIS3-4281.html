Guan Guangfu said: Having analyzed and assessed the  anticorruption work over the past few months, the Central  Committee has set out the need to seize the opportunity, deepen  reform, expand opening up, promote development, and maintain  stability [zhua zhu ji yu shen hua gai ge kuo da kai fang chu  jin fa zhan bao chi wen ding], which is the overall situation in  the work of the entire party. Discipline inspection work must  subject to and serve this overall situation. The provincial  party committee has already made arrangements for work in 1994  and set out that 1994 is a year of reform, forging ahead,  implementation, and building clean government. This requirement  embodies the principle of grasping two types of work  simultaneously and paying equal attention to both and complies  with the overall work situation of the entire party. Party  committees, governments, commissions for discipline inspection,  and procuratorate organizations at all levels should correctly  differentiate and handle two categories of contradictions. It  is imperative to resolutely crack down on all law-breaking and  criminal activities and mete out the appropriate penalties in  cases of corruption. [passage omitted]    Guan Guangfu said that, consolidating and augmenting  flesh-and- blood and party-and-people ties is the fundamental  goal of waging the anticorruption struggle and has a bearing on  the rise or fall and success or failure of the party's cause,  not to mention the basic issue of the party's life or death. He  indicated that the overwhelming majority of the people have  improved their living standards through reform, opening up, and  economic development; however, some of our state-owned  enterprises are really suffering from their economic  difficulties, and it has been a hard life for the workers, staff  members, and people there. We should always bear the masses in  mind, show concern for them, and adopt effective measures to  help them resolve difficulties. [passage omitted]    In conclusion, Guan Guangfu said, the key to waging the  anticorruption struggle in depth and with consistent efforts and  reliable effects lies in augmenting leadership. Party  committees and governments at all levels must continue to place  the anticorruption struggle on the agenda and augment leadership  in a down- to-earth way. It is necessary to establish the  responsibility system and augment supervision and examination.  Party committees at all levels must support discipline  inspection work and supervision departments and help them  resolve their difficulties. [passage omitted]    Approximately, 600 participants attended the meeting,  including Qian Yunlu, provincial party committee deputy  secretary; its standing committee members Ding Fengying, Li  Daqiang, Wang Shengtie, and Huang Yuanzhi; Wang Hanzhang,  Provincial People's Congress Standing Committee vice chairman;  Zhong Shuqiao, Provincial Committee of Chinese People's  Political Consultative Conference vice chairman; Li Qifan,  Provincial Higher People's Court president; Zhong Shuqin,  Provincial People's Procuratorate chief procurator; Hou Guodao,  Wang Zhuru, and Liu Yadong, Provincial Commission for Discipline  Inspection deputy secretaries; responsible persons of party  groups, party committees of all departments and commissions  directly under the provincial party committee, government organs  at provincial level, various commissions, offices, bureaus,  general companies, and mass organizations.</p>

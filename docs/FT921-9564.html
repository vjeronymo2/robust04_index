			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Sharp response to Quayle on trade THE WARNING by Mr Dan Quayle, US vice-president, that a failure to conclude the Uruguay Round trade talks could fuel protectionism in the US and encourage those wanting to pull all US troops out of Nato, drew a sharp response yesterday from European Community agriculture ministers. The reaction came as Mr Quayle said his remarks had been misinterpreted. The agriculture ministers were meeting in Brussels to discuss plans to reform the EC's Common Agricultural Policy and farm subsidy reductions within the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade liberalisation negotiations - the main obstacle to conclusion of the Round. Mr John Gummer, UK agriculture minister, said: 'There's been too much of this megaphone diplomacy. This kind of behaviour is not very helpful. There is a lot at stake, in a sensitive negotiation, which has to be between equal partners.' He added that 'no doubt it was something he (Mr Quayle) was not properly briefed on'. The UK is among the minority of member states having little difficulty with the farm subsidies formula drawn up by Gatt in December, which the EC as a whole is seeking to renegotiate. France has led efforts to limit the degree of liberalisation in farm trade sought by Gatt, whereas most of its partners want amendments to make the subsidy cuts compatible with EC farm reform. Mr Quayle's damage limitation exercise was undertaken at a news conference in Geneva. He denied any specific linkage between a breakdown of the Gatt talks and US troop levels in Europe, but he stressed that there was inevitably a link between economic and military security. The US vice-president sought to distance himself from more forthright remarks by other prominent US participants at an international defence conference in Munich on Sunday, who underlined the military consequences for Europe of a failure in the Gatt talks. Stressing that he wanted to correct a 'misimpression', Mr Quayle said that, unlike the other speakers at the Munich seminar, he was speaking for President George Bush and the US administration when he said there was no linkage between the Gatt talks and US troop levels in Europe. However, he followed up these soothing words with an another stern warning that a breakdown of the Uruguay Round of trade talks could trigger 'mindless spending' on subsidies, which the US would feel obliged to match. 'The US will certainly meet any subsidies with an in-kind response,' he said.</p>

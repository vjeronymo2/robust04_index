			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Borko Stosic from Geneva] </F>   [Text] The Serbian delegation arrived in Geneva this  afternoon. Immediately upon their arrival from the airport,  President Krajisnik [title as heard] and Foreign Minister Aleksa  Buha left for the Russian Permanent Mission to the United  Nations where they sat down with the member of the contact group  representing Russia. They stayed there for nearly two hours and  afterward went directly to the Palace of Nations to meet with  Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg. This meeting lasted for  quite some time.    At approximately 1700, after the meeting, Momcilo Krajisnik  gave a brief statement for the press in which he stressed that  the Serbian Republic delegation will participate in the talks on  three conditions:    That it be given a perfectly equal status;    That all hostilities end immediately;    That the percentages regarding the division of territories  be  a subject of discussion and negotiations and not determined in  advance by a dictate. Namely, if this is the case then there is  no reason for the talks.    Regarding [President of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency]  Alija Izetbegovic, he is repeating his stance that he had not  arrived to negotiate but to merely inform himself and establish  contacts with the representatives of the United States and  Russia in the contact group.</p>

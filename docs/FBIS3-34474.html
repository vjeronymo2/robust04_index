			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Staff Brigadier General </F> Haytham Qasim Tahir by Lutfi Shatarah in Aden; date not given]    [Excerpts] [Shatarah] A visitor to Yemen, which is  experiencing one of its most serious political crises, senses  profound official and popular optimism about the Pledge and  Accord Document resulting from the national dialogue. In your  view, what is the national and historic importance of this  document?    [Tahir] The document's importance is that it represents a  national consensus base in which everyone shoulders their  responsibility honorably and sincerely. It embodies the Yemeni  democratic political movement's ability to respond to the  homeland's and people's objective need for democracy and to  build the institutions of the unified state in accordance with  contemporary concepts. The national and historic importance of  this document transcends all the secondary and narrow agreements  based on the principle of balance and power sharing between the  two parties which forged unity. [passage omitted]    [Shatarah] What new elements has the document introduced at  the military level, and how would you assess its importance with  regard to the military building of the unified state?    [Tahir] At the military level it can be said that this  document has drawn up a clear strategic concept to rebuild -- I  repeat, rebuild -- and organize the Armed Forces on the basis of  modern national foundations matching the comprehensive unionist  and democratic developments on the national and international  scenes. More importantly, it has drawn up principles that are  bound to reinforce the army's status and positive role in the  context of the development process and to turn it into a factor  of progress and stability rather than an obstacle to it. And as  you noted, it specified the tasks for the Armed Forces in terms  of the corps, their ideal sizes, their organization, and how  they should be run. It also drew up the general outlines for  attaining optimum preparedness, armament levels, organization,  and rehabilitation. It can be said that for the first time  national forces have been able to contribute directly to  formulating a methodological view of the homeland's defense  issue and to enhancing the Armed Forces' capability. [passage  omitted]    [Shatarah] In your capacity as a leader of the Yemeni  Socialist Party [YSP], which is a party to the current crisis,  do you expect the Pledge and Accord Document to succeed? And in  your view, what factor and conditions are needed for its  successful implementation?    [Tahir] The criterion of any document's importance lies in  its being turned into a transforming force and achieving the  aims sought from it. It also lies in our ability to implement  this document. Implementation of this document cannot be  "partial" or "selective" in accordance with the criteria of  narrow interests. It should be comprehensive and on schedule.  And I hope the document will be different from the previous  ones, namely that it will be seriously implemented and  translated into reality.    As for the guarantees and conditions for its implementation,  they lie in a group of practical and binding implementation  measures which should be formulated and crystallized by the  dialogue committee as part of this document. [passage omitted]    [Shatarah] What are the conditions and guarantees at the  military level? Implementing this document at the military  level requires huge material and human resources in moving units  to new positions. Have all the arrangements been made in this  connection?    [Tahir] Success at the military level cannot be in  isolation from the success of the implementation process as a  whole. It is an integrated process. Birds cannot fly with one  wing. I believe that the conditions for success are general  before they can be particular, and all the country's  capabilities, resources, and energies should be utilized to  secure these conditions as long as they are to do with building  foundations for a new unionist, strong, and prosperous state.    With regard to the capabilities needed to move the more  disciplined military units, it is a very significant point.  There are additional requirements which I believe society and  the state will not be unable to meet. Citizens who have  suffered a great deal as a result of the crisis, for the sake of  defending unity and building a contemporary state, can see that  the aim for which they have been struggling is about to be  achieved, and are thus willing to make further sacrifices, even  if the situation requires that they sacrifice their own lives  for the sake of important and noble aims. The country's  resources and capabilities are great and sufficient if they are  used rationally and utilized correctly.    [Shatarah] The Armed Forces are given more attention in the  national dialogue than any other institution. What do you think  the reason for this is, and what are your plans to implement  what is mentioned in the document with regard to the military  aspect?    [Tahir] As you said, the military aspect was given more  attention by the various parties engaged in the dialogue than  any other aspect. Maybe because of the existence of legitimate  concerns. Some people are rightly concerned about the present  position of the Armed Forces and hence the potential sinister  dangers and risks. And maybe because the Armed Forces represent  the melting pot of Yemeni unity which accommodates all  contradictions and the homeland's social, political, cultural,  and geographical map. And their complete unification is a  necessity to ensure unity's victory and consolidation. This  importance is also derived from the Armed Forces' distinctive  role in safeguarding the achievements of unity, the revolution,  and democracy.    With regard to our plans for implementation, the document  clearly specified the general outlines of our tasks in the Armed  Forces, namely, to complete their merger, their redeployment,  their withdrawal from the partition areas, and other tasks. It  also specifies the timetable for implementing that. So we have  begun to analyze and assess what is mentioned in the document  and to draw up detailed tasks and steps for implementation, in  addition to the necessary means and methods. We have formed  specialized committees for each task and determined the  orientations, aims, and principles that guarantee accurate and  rigorous implementation.    [Shatarah] The document stipulates that the units present in  what used to be known as the fringes between the two parts of  Yemen be moved. To what areas will they be moved?    [Tahir] That principle is not prompted by the crisis or the  present situation, to defuse that situation and avert an  explosion in the present crisis, or to spare these units the  risks of political frictions. It has always been part of our  general view since the first day of unity. Because there is no  military, security, or even economic need for these units to  remain in their old positions. Their current presence has  partially embodied the partition reality, even psychologically.  The units should be moved to the areas that require the army's  services and national and historic role in defending national  sovereignty and protecting the people's economic interests  against any aggression. That is, the units' movement should be  governed by the principle of reinforcing the homeland's security  and stability, protecting economic installations and foreign  companies, closing outlets for terrorism and smuggling, and  decisively contributing to combating them. [passage omitted]    [Shatarah] What military units are required to be moved from  the cities?    [Tahir] All military units that have combat tasks and  weapons and which have no service, administrative, or military  tasks that require their remaining in the cities. I believe  that the stipulation is very clear in the document.    [Shatarah] Southern military officials demanded the need to  abolish the Republican Guard and merge the Armed Forces. Why?  And is there an alternative plan to provide protection for the  president, vice president, and the other Presidential Council  members?    [Tahir] Before unity the Republican Guard existed within  the military formation of the Armed Forces in the northern  governorates. Its leadership is under the control of the head  of state along the lines of the practice in some countries, like  fraternal Iraq. There is nothing similar to it in the southern  or eastern governorates. The Republican Guard is not an  internal security unit, as some people think. They are combat  military units with a high level of preparedness and advanced  and modern armament.    In terms of its structure, preparedness, and armament, the  Republican Guard is above all else prepared to carry out  large-scale military tasks to defend national sovereignty. This  is why it is necessary for them to be within the formation of  the Yemeni Armed Forces and for its units to be merged within  the Yemeni Army. [passage omitted]    [Shatarah] There have been numerous reports of the YSP's  rejection of plans to move the camps from the fringes to the  positions allocated to defending national sovereignty.    [Tahir] I am talking to you in my capacity as the defense  minister of the Republic of Yemen, not as a partisan element.    All that is being reported about this or that party's  rejection is untrue. It is a joint responsibility in all cases  of failure and in all cases of success. We spoke about that  earlier. The Army's deployment in the fringes continues to  represent a form of partition and embody a failure to unify and  merge the two armies after unity. The situation continued in  that manner until the crisis emerged, when it assumed serious  political dimensions. [passage omitted]    [Shatarah] Some observers believe that there will always be  obstacles to the unification of the Armed Forces because of the  clear difference between the two armies in terms of their  partisan affiliations and the personnel's military and political  upbringing?    [Tahir] The observers' expectations are inaccurate, indeed  untrue. I do not whether this error is the result of their  ignorance of the simplest axioms of Yemeni unity, which was  established between two coherent social entities that are united  in many aspects within a historical, geographical, and social  framework and one stock and one religion. What is more, they  are more united by family ties and demographic interlinkage than  by political decisions, which have merely embodied the popular  and official will and action. The army is part of this people.  Its personnel have grown up under one Yemeni revolution and in  a deep-rooted unionist foundation. No secondary factors can  pose a threat to the spiritual, historical, ethical, and  unionist formation of Yemeni fighters. [passage omitted]    [Shatarah] How do you view the U.S. and European move to  include U.S. and Western military officials in the military  committees which are visiting the camps? And will their role  focus on averting a military confrontation?    [Tahir] Military representatives from some embassies of the  friendly states that expressed interest in the crisis and  internal conditions in Yemen will participate in some field  visits by the competent military committees. This military  activity is an extension to their political and diplomatic  activity aimed at resolving the crisis peacefully and through a  broadly based democratic dialogue founded on safeguarding unity,  building a contemporary state, and broadening the masses'  participation in power. We thank these parties for their  sincere efforts to secure a rapprochement of views at the  political level and reduce military tension in the fringes. We  thank them for their endeavors to avert the threats of war.    [Shatarah] If the parties which signed the document fail to  implement its clauses, do you expect the situation to be settled  militarily?    [Tahir] Why should we expect failure, not certain success?  That is what I believe, for several reasons: First, we are  serious and indeed determined to work to make the document a  success. Nothing is impossible if there is a national will and  consensus to work for the sake of the homeland.    Second, I believe that the document contains many success  factors, namely, the national consensus, absolute popular  support, and the great Arab and international blessing and  support it enjoys.    Talk about the possible failure or abortion of this great  plan is nothing but a desire and dream among those who are  harmed by national reform and the building of a contemporary  state, and among the enemies of unity and democracy, who by any  standards are few and have no influence.    [Shatarah] What about the possibility of war?    [Tahir] The possibility of war is remote from our political  vocabulary. Everyone realizes -- indeed, is convinced -- that  war and its calamitous devastation are futile. [passage omitted]    [Shatarah] Right now, Yemen is experiencing a state of real  separation. In your view, what are the ways out if the  situation continues as it stands and if the clauses of the  agreement are not implemented?    [Tahir] The crisis is the result of objective reality. It  has its own causes and forces, and surmounting it is not  impossible.    We always rely on the language of reason and dialogue.  Because it is capable of solving the most complex of problems  in a democratic and civilized manner. Despite the complexity  and seriousness of the situation, it is still under political  control. I always bank on the masses and their action, which  achieved the Pledge and Accord Document. I believe that they  are capable of implementing it. They achieved unity and they  are its protectors.    If the document -- God forbid -- is not implemented, I  personally cannot even accurately predict the disastrous  consequences for the homeland's unity and future. If something  of that kind takes place, it will mean an absolute inability to  control the situation and its fallout. It would be a  catastrophe by any standards.    Everyone has a grave national responsibility and crucial  choice. Everyone must shoulder this responsibility both  honorably and sincerely. And since we have succeeded in drawing  up this document, we must continue to struggle in the same  spirit for the sake of its implementation. [passage omitted]</p>

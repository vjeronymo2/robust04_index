			<p><P> October 21, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'GAY-BASHING' AS AN ART FORM;  </P> <P> ART: THE MAPPLETHORPE AFFAIR REVEALS A LINKAGE OF QUIRKY CONSERVATIVE IMPULSES  IN ART, ECONOMICS AND POLITICS.  </P> <P> Conservatives have cooked up a grimly Malthusian policy for the arts, motivated  partly by free-market economic dogma, partly by an ideological (and  public-relations) need to indulge in conspicuous displays of moral outrage.  Press accounts have concentrated on the fulminations of Jesse Helms, giving  scant attention to the real strategists of this cultural battle, the brave  lieutenants of the intellectual right.  </P> <P> I'm thinking here of Hilton Kramer, former art critic for the New York Times  and currently editor of the New Criterion, and Samuel Lipman, publisher of that  journal of conservative cultural opinion. The cultural traditionalism they've  been refining over the years is now having its day in the limelight, in the  controversy over "obscene" art underwritten by tax dollars through the National  Endowment for the Arts. The flash point was a scheduled exhibition, partly  funded by the NEA, of the late Robert Mapplethorpe's work, photographs commonly  described as "homoerotic" in content.  </P> <P> Kramer and Lipman have been seeking to restrict the funding of the arts  endowment since the very beginning of the Reagan presidency. Ideologically,  they are committed to a vision of late-modernist culture derived from the  earlier modernism of T. S. Eliot. They seek to erect a stable, authoritative  canon of great works of the past, and to defend practitioners of contemporary  art who have an intelligent and polite dialogue with that canon. Artists with  an impolite, aggressive or debunking attitude to the art of the past don't rank  very high with Lipman and Kramer; for example, they don't like the Dadaists.  </P> <P> Lipman in particular would like to see the NEA become a ministry of dead art,  funding only the historical endeavors of museums. This makes sense in  conservative terms, since recent tax-law changes have removed incentives for  private collectors to donate art to museums, and escalating art prices have  made it difficult for museums to compete with these same private collectors. A  real institutional crisis is brewing, precisely because of the speculative  hypertrophy of the free market. You might say that Lipman favors a modest  museum bail-out program based on shifting money from living art to dead art.  </P> <P> These people make a lot of noise about allowing contemporary art to succeed or  fail in the marketplace. Kramer has no problem, he claims, with a private  culture of homosexual eroticism. What bothers Kramer is the implied moral  imprimatur of government funding for public art exhibitions.  </P> <P> Liberals are suffering from a failure of nerve in this regard, allowing the  right wing to hold the moral and the economic high ground. We should be  aggressive in exposing both the homophobia and the economic inconsistencies of  the conservative argument.  </P> <P> Kramer is happy as long as homosexual culture remains in the closet, and he's  even willing to accept a small homosexual aristocracy of taste within the art  world. How generous.  </P> <P> What terrifies conservatives like him and Lipman is a truly popular, open  homosexual culture, a culture capable of forging alliances and bonds with  dissident and mainstream groups in this society. They worry about the sort of  politicized gay and lesbian culture that has emerged since the Stonewall  Rebellion of 1969 and is gathering strength now in response to the AIDS crisis.  </P> <P> Robert Mapplethorpe and gays in general are being stigmatized for taking  seriously one of the utopian promises of the capitalist consumer economy: the  promise of liberated desire. According to conservatives, gays and lesbians are  suspect because they don't reproduce "normal" family life. They supposedly  don't have children, and they often work in "frivolous" fields on the fringe of  the GNP. In other words, conservatives project their own fears of both  unfettered desire and an impotent economy onto gay and lesbian people, who are  easily scapegoated in a society obsessed with productivity.  </P> <P> Liberals in government are stigmatized for their willingness to support a  "hedonistic" and "bohemian" culture. Lipman chastises the very modestly funded  NEA for its "profligacy." Another conservative intellectual, Gertrude  Himmelfarb, recently suggested a connection between the (supposed) spendthrift  shortsightedness of Keynesian economics and John Maynard Keynes' personal life  as a homosexual.  </P> <P> These are strange accusations that beg for both economic and psychological  analysis. Sigmund Freud understood the phenomenon of the "reaction formation,"  the attempt to control a repressed wish. The parsimonious effort to control the  orifices of government spending may well be a cover for the spendthrift  impulses of conservatives themselves. Maybe conservatives are all closet  Keynesians, secret believers in government deficit spending, notably of the  military variety.  </P> <P> Samuel Lipman's New Criterion is handsomely funded by the ultraconservative  John M. Olin Foundation. Olin money comes not from some abstract patronage pool  in the sky, but from the Olin Corp., a major chemical and munitions  manufacturer. And where would Jesse Helms be without his two causes -- tobacco  subsidies and military aid to brutal Central American rightists? As threats to  public health, Robert Mapplethorpe's deadpan late-1970s pictures of unwittingly  unsafe sex between consenting adult men hardly compare.  </P> <P> It has been too easy for the "art world' -- a label that suggests both  cosmopolitanism and parochialism -- to see itself as a unified body under  attack by philistines. The art world is perfectly capable of dividing against  itself under pressure from without. Some arts administrators have stated their  willingness to "live with" a congressional funding compromise that stigmatizes  "homoerotic" expression. This will create a zone of moral quarantine. Why  should gay and lesbian artists have to live and work under this shadow? Why  should any artist who wishes to speak about the complicated vicissitudes of  sexuality have to endure the special scrutiny of the government? And why should  any other artist accept this stigmatization of his or her colleagues?  </P> <P> A large and distinguished assemblage of artists is boycotting the Corcoran  Gallery of Art, the Washington institution that volunteered to serve as the  laboratory for conservative cultural policy by canceling a scheduled  Mapplethorpe exhibition. The boycott is an appropriate and justified response,  a kind of strike. The issue now is to develop common ground with other groups  seeking to defend civil rights and liberties in an increasingly authoritarian  society.  </P></p>

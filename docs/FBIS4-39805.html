			<p>BFN     [Text] On 7 June in Simferopol, the Crimean Supreme  Council held its regular plenary session, at which it discussed  a document produced by a working group of Ukrainian and Crimean  deputies.    The session definitively confirmed the division of the  "Rossiya" bloc into the "Rossiya" (around 40 people) and  "Respublika" (10 people) factions. The former approved the  document, in which "Respublika" members termed its position as  "treacherous."    It was decided to consider the document and to submit it to  the Crimean Supreme Council Presidium for discussion.</p>

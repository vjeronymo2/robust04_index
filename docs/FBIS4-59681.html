			<p>BFN     [Text] Mr. 'Ali Salim al-Bid, the vice chairman of the  Presidential Council and secretary general of the Yemeni  Socialist Party [YSP], made a telephone call to Isayas Afwerki,  the president of the State of Eritrea. During the call he  informed him about the current situation in our country in the  light of the barbaric attack launched by the al-Ahmar gang  against the Yemeni people. He also informed him about the  contents of the peace initiative presented by the politburo of  the YSP to come out of the current crisis and (?rid off) our  Yemeni people more catastrophes and destruction.    The president of Eritrea, for his part, warned against the  danger of the current situations in Yemen and negative effects  of the current war on the present and future of the Yemeni  people. He affirmed Eritrea's rejection of settling the crisis  by military options. Afwerki called for the necessity of  responding to all peace initiatives concerning the Yemeni crisis  and immediate cease- fire and resort to the political dialogue  as the best way to settle the current political crisis and  (?ridding) Yemen of more destruction and to spare the blood of  the Yemenis.</p>

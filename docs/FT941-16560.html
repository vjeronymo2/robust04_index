			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / Wibble sees signs of life in ailing Swedish economy: Figures are starting to add up for tough-minded finance minister Mrs Anne Wibble, Sweden's finance minister, is a plain-speaking politician who has pulled few policy punches as she has battled her way through two years of economic crisis. With a deficit still of towering proportions, she has little room to offer relief when she announces her 1994-95 budget today. But the dour Wibble demeanour of the past is likely to give way to a more upbeat message. As a general election looms in September and with the economy at last showing signs of revival, the right-centre coalition is anxious to show that its market-oriented medicine is beginning to work a cure on the deepest recession Sweden has suffered since before the second world war. According to finance ministry figures leaked last week, the economy is reckoned to have shrunk by 2 per cent last year, not the near 3 per cent forecast last October. The ministry predicts gross national product growth of 2.4 per cent this year against its previous estimate of 1.9 per cent. Sharply improved competitiveness, stemming from a 25 per cent fall in the value of the Swedish krona last year and significant improvements in productivity, has given a shot in the arm to export-oriented manufacturers. As a result, the new figures show industrial production rose in 1993 by 2.7 per cent and will grow by 8.5 per cent this year; exports are set to rise by more than 10 per cent this year after a 7.4 per cent surge in 1993, and the current account is expected to move into surplus. The government can also point to other positive trends. Interest rates have fallen steadily to around 5 per cent, producing, among other effects, a dramatic improvement in the performance of commercial banks which a year ago were brought to their knees by a spate of loan losses. Although the bank crisis has cost the taxpayer some SKr90bn (Pounds 7.3bn) in bail-out commitments, there should now be no more calls on the state coffers. Inflation, the bugbear of the Swedish economy in the 1980s, also seems to be under control, despite the heavy devaluation of the krona. It rose by more than 4 per cent in 1993 but should be about 2.5 per cent this year and remain steady in 1995. All this has given the government, led by Mr Carl Bildt's conservative Moderates, grounds for proclaiming that its market reform policies have laid the basis for a sustained recovery through to the end of the century. But it still faces an uphill battle to rebuff the claim by the opposition Social Democrats that this rosy prediction ignores the deep malaise still afflicting the domestic economy. Above all, the export-led upturn has made no impact on record levels of unemployment, which pose the biggest threat to the government. In less than four years, the proportion of the workforce on the dole or in state training schemes has risen from around 5 per cent to 14 per cent. At best, only a marginal reduction is expected this year. Most of the output gains in the export industries are being made through improved productivity, while the domestic sector continues to be suppressed by low private consumption and the deficit-driven squeeze on public spending. Private consumption, which accounts for 55 per cent of GNP, shrank by some 4 per cent in 1993, and is expected to show only marginal growth this year. Net investment is predicted to contract by around 7 per cent this year after a fall of 14 per cent last. Meanwhile, unemployment costs especially have thwarted the government's efforts to control the budget deficit, which autumn forecasts predicted would reach 15 per cent of GNP in the current June-July budget year. Central government debt has shot up to more than SKr1,000bn (Pounds 81.3bn), or about 70 per cent of GNP, from about SKr600bn in 1990. Despite some hefty cuts in public spending programmes, the public sector still accounts for around 70 per cent of GNP in Sweden. The Social Democrats, warning of a 'debt trap' if there is not a speedy return to growth and a fall in unemployment costs, have called for a demand stimulus to kick-start the domestic economy. They suggest a cut in value added tax and delays in other planned tax increases. But Mrs Wibble (who belongs to the Liberal party) has insisted there is no room for a fiscal stimulus. As much as she and Mr Bildt would dearly love to cut the tax burden, the finance minister insisted in an interview in December that curbing the deficit remains the priority, even in an election year. Newspaper reports have warned of more cuts in welfare benefits today to help get the borrowing requirement back on a downward curve.</p>

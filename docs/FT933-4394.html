			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / S&amp;P wins little credit from card rivals: Save &amp; Prosper's rate cut has not been followed CREDIT CARD issuers have refused to follow the surprise move on Tuesday by Save &amp; Prosper, the investment house, to launch a Visa card at interest rates substantially below the industry average. What is at issue is whether S&amp;P's move is sustainable in the long term and can be followed by its competitors and whether this suggests that the industry is currently charging too much. The credit card norm is an annualised rate of interest of about 23 per cent. Yet S&amp;P says it will charge only 14.6 per cent per year. Base rates are currently 6 per cent. Card issuers have been criticised by consumer groups for failing to bring down their interest charges in line with base rates. When base rates were 12 per cent in August 1988, the interest rate on credit cards rose to an annualised percentage rate (APR) of between 25.3 and 26.8 per cent, according to the Credit Card Research Group. Base rates have since halved but credit card APRs are between 21.6 and 29.8 per cent. Store cards are even more expensive. Last month Labour accused store groups of charging extortionate interest rates. It said the average margin over base rate charged on store cards had risen from 18 per cent in 1990 to 21 per cent and that some stores charged as much as 34.4 per cent. Credit card issuers say that base rates are only one of several factors determining their rates. 'When someone buys a car, they don't say metal costs such and such, so why does the car cost so much,' said Mr Roger Elwell of National Westminster Bank, which has 4m cards in issue. 'We have the cost of processing payments, paying staff, and building in a risk element because of bad debts and the cost of fraud.' But issuers have cut their costs by introducing annual fees and by charging interest from the date of the transaction rather than the statement date for those customers who do not settle their monthly bills in full. S&amp;P openly accuses the main issuers of overcharging. Mr Ian Lindsey, the S&amp;P director responsible for banking services, said: 'We believe the high street banks are overcharging their credit card customers in order to compensate for the losses they are making on personal current accounts.' NatWest and Girobank yesterday denied cross-subsidisation and said interest rates are determined by the total cost of running the credit card operation. Barclays, the largest issuer with 8.8m cards, said that a mass-market operator could not sustain the operation at S&amp;P's rates. It also said its own card provides a wider range of associated benefits than the new S&amp;P card. In common with several other banks, it expressed scepticism that S&amp;P will be able to maintain its interest rate differential with the leading providers. Mr Lindsey denied that S&amp;P's rate of interest had been pitched low to attract new customers and would be increased in the future. 'If the general level of interest rates remains unchanged for the next decade, then our rate will not change; that's a cast-iron guarantee,' he said. S&amp;P says it will break even on the new card within a year with 25,000 customers, although its target is to attract 100,000 new cardholders. The new card seems unlikely to push other issuers to reduce their rates. It has just 100,000 cards in issue at present, against 20m cardholders in the UK. Even doubling its total will hardly pose a threat to the large issuers. It will also be more discriminating than the large issuers in the selection of customers, which should mean a proportionately smaller bad-debt bill than the larger issuers. Cardholders must own their home, be resident in the UK, have a regular income and a clean credit record. Those earning less than Pounds 10,000 a year are unlikely to be admitted. It also says just 30 per cent of its customers pay no interest on their cards, against an industry average of at least 50 per cent. That suggests it can afford to offer lower rates since it will generate interest charges from a higher proportion of its cardholder base.</p>

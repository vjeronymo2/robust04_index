The government has therefore decided to ask the  Constitutional Court to rule whether or not the lustration law  is compatible with the Slovak Constitution, they said. State  Secretary in the Slovak Ministry of Justice Milan Handel pointed  to several cases in which one person has been screened both  positively and negatively.    Hanzel ruled out the possibility of political aspects  influencing the government decision, arguing that the ministry  had been dealing solely with "the judicial part of the matter."    He said the ministry had received some 50 complaints in  connection with the lustration law. He did not, however, give  the number of people who have been screened in Slovakia.    The screening law passed by the now-defunct Czechoslovak  Federal Parliament in 1991 bars former Communist Party  officials, agents of the former secret police (StB) and members  of the people's militia (Communist Party Armed Force) from high  economic and political posts until 1996.</p>

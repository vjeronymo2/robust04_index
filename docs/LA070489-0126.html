			<p><P> July 4, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> OFFER BY D.A. PROMPTS GUILTY PLEA TO MURDER  </P> <P> Swayed by a favorable offer from prosecutors, a Lido Isle man pleaded guilty  Monday to first-demurder in the killing of his wife's ex-lover, who was gunned  down outside a Yorba Linda convenience store on Christmas night last year.  </P> <P> Patrick M. McBurney, 26, faces 27 years to life in prison when he returns to  Orange County Superior Court on Aug. 2 for sentencing in the murder of Lance  Michael Roney, 23.  </P> <P> Under an agreement struck over the weekend, prosecutors agreed to drop an  allegation that McBurney had lain in wait for his prospective victim -- an  allegation that could have meant life in prison without the possibility of  parole.  </P> <P> "We got an offer from the D.A. on Friday morning and we decided it was a good  one," explained defense attorney Ronald K. Perry of San Pedro. "We had a very  genuine fear that (McBurney) could spend the rest of his natural life behind  bars." Now, however, McBurney may be paroled in about 17 years, his lawyer  said.  </P> <P> Said Deputy Dist. Atty. Jill Roberts, "We're satisfied that the case was  resolved fairly for everyone."  </P> <P> Lawyers on both sides described the motive in the killing as revenge.  </P> <P> A computer analyst in a small firm, McBurney became enraged when he learned  that his wife had a brief affair with a co-worker and that she was planning to  leave McBurney and take their 2-year-old daughter with her, Perry said.  </P> <P> "That caused him to lose all reason, and he shot the lover," Perry said in an  interview.  </P> <P> The victim was shot in the head and chest on Christmas night outside a 7-Eleven  store in the 19000 block of Yorba Linda Boulevard. Roney was flown to a  hospital, where he was later pronounced dead. McBurney was arrested without  incident the next morning.  </P></p>

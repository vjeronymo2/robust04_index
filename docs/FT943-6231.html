			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / Blaze leaves 3,000 homeless in Bangkok A fire blazed through Bangkok's Klong Toey slum district yesterday, destroying up to 700 homes, AP reports from Bangkok. Officials said only one rescue worker was injured, but 3,000 residents were left without homes. The fire spread rapidly through the low-income district because many the homes are built of wood and packed close together. The authorities are investigating the cause of the fire.</p>

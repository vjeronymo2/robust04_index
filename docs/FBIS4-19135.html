			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Renate Koecher: "Chancellor Leaps Forward"] </F>   [Text] For two years, moods in the old and new laender  were at a low point. But then change occurred in the beginning  of 1994. In the minds of many Germans, cautious optimism took  the place of debilitating pessimism. Since then, the number of  survey respondents who consider the situation in Germany  alarming has been sinking from one month to the next. Heading  in the same direction are fears that the government is incapable  of action; whereas in February, 27 percent of the respondents  were very concerned about the government's ability to act, in  April only 22 percent entertained such a fear. The first signs  of an economic improvement are fuelling public opinions. In  January, in the old laender, 48 percent of respondents still  feared the situation would deteriorate further. Only 17 percent  expected a moderate improvement. On the other hand, in April  only 32 percent of west German respondents and 29 percent of  east German respondents considered the economic prospects grim.  The population seems to be heaving a sigh of relief. Obviously  it thinks the worst has already been left behind.    This improvement in moods also means a better starting  position for the government. Support for Chancellor Kohl's  policies has been growing slowly but surely for months. Kohl's  challenger, SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] chairman  Scharping, might still be ahead of Kohl in the popularity  charts, but the graphs showing people's choice of chancellor  display a similar trend to that of previous election years.  Already in the past, Helmut Kohl started off from a seemingly  hopeless position and yet managed to race ahead of others.  Since January, Scharping's lead in the old laender has fallen  from 9 to 6 percent, mainly because of increased popularity for  Kohl, but also because of increased reservations about Scharping.    Scharping has been collecting minus points over the past few  months, especially in the old laender. In January, 29 percent  of the west German population still agreed with his line, 18  percent criticized it, and 53 percent had no fixed opinion. But  today, more people claim to know what Scharping stands for,  which works to his disadvantage because the number of people  supportive of his line remains at a constant 29 percent, but the  number of people critical of him has risen from 18 to 29 percent  over the past 10 weeks. Only in the new laender do the people  who approve of Scharping (24 percent of survey respondents)  outnumber those who do not (17 percent).    So far, the growing criticism of the SPD chairman has had no  effect on his party. For the second time this year, the SPD  enjoys a measure of support exceeding 40 percent. Over the past  few weeks, the SPD has increased its popularity rating by 2.3  percent, whereas the Christian Democratic Union/Christian  Socialist union, also at a low level, have increased theirs by  2.4 percent. Both the people's parties together would receive  about 75 percent of the vote right now. Following the outcome  of the Lower Saxony vote, this is yet another indication that it  is too early to say that the people's parties are finished.  According to surveys, the Free Democrats would achieve 8  percent of the vote, and the Greens/Alliance 90 would receive 10  percent. The extremist parties, the Republikaner and the  Democratic Socialist Party, have no chances whatsoever at  present.</p>

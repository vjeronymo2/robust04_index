The Commission has enhanced the participation of affected interests in the rulemaking by soliciting commentary from these interests on the rulemaking issues before the staff developed the draft proposed rule. This document announces the availability of the staff's draft proposed rule as well as a summary of the comments provided to the NRC in response to its enhancement efforts. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The comment period expires March 11, 1994.

The Commission believes it is desirable to provide for early and comprehensive input from affected interests on important public health and safety issues, such as the development of radiological criteria for decommissioning.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission obtained comments on the scope, issues and approaches that must be addressed in establishing the radiological criteria for decommissioning through a series of workshops (57 FR 58727; December 11, 1992), generic environmental impact statement (GEIS) scoping meetings (58 FR 33570; June 18, 1993), a dedicated electronic bulletin board system (BBS) (58 FR 37760; July 13, 1993) and written submissions. A summary of these early comments received on this rulemaking, NUREG/CR&hyph;6156, and a copy of the staff's draft rule have been provided to NRC Agreement States, workshop participants, and other interested parties upon publication of this notice of availability. Interested parties may obtain single copies of NUREG/CR&hyph;6156 and the staff's draft rule by any of the three following methods:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Downloading the files from the BBS;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Requesting a copy from Ms. Roberta Gordon, Mail Stop NLS/139, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, telephone (301) 492&hyph;3746; FAX (301) 492&hyph;3866; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.

Box 37082, Washington, DC 20013&hyph;7082. Copies are also available from the National Technical Information Service, 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161.

Comments may be submitted electronically, in either ASCII text or Wordperfect format, by calling the NRC enhanced participatory rulemaking electronic bulletin board at (800) 880&hyph;6091. The bulletin board can be accessed using generally available communications software, with communication protocol setting of no parity, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit (N,8,1) and ANSI or VT&hyph;100 terminal emulation. Background documents on the rulemakings are also available for downloading and viewing on the bulletin board. For more information call Ms. Christine Daily, Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, telephone (301) 492&hyph;3999; FAX (301) 492&hyph;3866.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NRC staff has considered the comments received in the development of the staff's draft rule. The availability of the staff's draft rule provides yet another opportunity for public comment early in this rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The normal process for conducting Commission rulemakings is the following sequence: NRC staff development of a draft proposed rule for Commission review and approval; publication of the proposed rule for public comment; consideration of the comments by the NRC staff; and preparation of a draft final rule for Commission approval. In this enhanced participatory rulemaking, not only have comments been solicited before the NRC staff prepared the draft proposed rule and the NRC staff discussed the issues with affected interests at public meetings, but an additional opportunity for public comment is being solicited during the preparation of the draft proposed rule. The preliminary views expressed in the staff's draft rule may change in light of comments received. In any case, there will be an opportunity for additional public comment in connection with any proposed rule that may be developed by the Commission. After the Commission review and approval of the draft proposed rule that is developed using the comments provided, the general process of issuing the proposed rule for public comment, NRC staff evaluation of comments, and preparation of a draft final rule for Commission approval, will occur. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 27th day of January, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Bill M.

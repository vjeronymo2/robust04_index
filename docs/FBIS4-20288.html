			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on an "exclusive" interview with President Suleyman </F> Demirel by Ilnur Cevik in Ankara; date not given]    [Text] President Suleyman Demirel said Turkey is a country  where we have freedom. "Despite this, I do not feel people have  fully understood what that means. In the troubles we have  experienced in the past and are now experiencing, we see that  people have difficulty understanding what freedom actually is.  If there is freedom, then actions which the laws forbid will be  regarded as crimes and all other actions will be tolerated. [no  closing quotation marks as published]    The president stressed that "if certain circles or people  decide certain actions which are not regarded as crimes by law  are actually crimes and if they also decide to penalize these  actions, then they may land Turkey in deep unrest. We have seen  in the past people being tried for things which are not actually  crimes and then they have been acquitted by courts. When this  is the case, certain people start criticizing the courts. If  you do not accept the rulings of the courts, if you do not obey  the laws, if you regard yourself as the court and declare your  own laws, then the end result will be chaos."    Demirel complained about the attitude of the press in Turkey  and said he had warned several times in the past that the press  was stepping out of line. "It is very important that the press  report about events in a free atmosphere, but the press has to  be aware that there are other democratic institutions which have  to be respected and that people have to accept their authorities  and their rulings and should not try to damage them." He seemed  to be referring to media pressure on the courts, especially the  Supreme Election Board, which has come under fire for its  rulings both before and after the elections.    Demirel said in the year 1994 the Turkish Republic has two  major assets. One is the constitutional state based on rules  and the other is the state institutions that will execute these  rules. "You can criticize this if these institutions of the  state do not function properly, but if none of the institutions  function, then this means the state is paralyzed. I cannot even  envisage such a thing in Turkey."    "Democratic reflex is a must for the state to function  properly," Demirel said, adding that if a nation does not raise  its voice when the country is not being run properly, then the  people deserve such administrators. "How can the people raise  their voice? They can do this through democratic platforms. We  have a free press in Turkey. We have a freely elected Parliament  where 11 parties are being represented. The rally squares and  the streets are free. No one should panic if the streets and  the squares of a country are being used for demonstrations  because I feel the right to demonstrate is one of the most  sacred rights given to people by democracy."    "We have to keep all channels open for people to express  themselves and seek their rights. One such channel is the right  to demonstrate. If you deny them such rights, then they will  feel justified to show resistance."  <H5>  A Consensus Needed </H5>   Demirel said Turks have to reach a national consensus on  whether the republic, democracy, secularism and religion can go  hand in hand together.    "Is democracy an institution which harms the republic? We  have to differentiate between democracy and the republic because  you can have a republic and you can have a democratic republic.  Does secularism harm democracy and the republic? Does  secularism harm Islam? Is Islam against secularism, democracy  and the republic? I feel the Turkish people have to reach a  consensus on all these issues."    Demirel said in a country where 99.9 percent of the people  are Muslims, secularism cannot be considered as atheism and it  cannot be applied as atheism. He pointed out that secularism is  the umbrella for freedom of religion and conscience in the  Turkish Republic. "The word secularism is being misused in  Turkey. The state is secular but individuals cannot be secular  as they either believe in God or they do not. The individual  either worships completely, partially or not at all. This is  all between the individual and God, and in the Muslim faith what  is important for a person is to believe that God is one. A  person will not stop being a Muslim just because she or he does  not worship. What is sin and what is not is up to God." The  president stressed that believing in God, praying and following  God's orders does not mean a person is against secularism. "I  was the person who told a rally crowd in Sakarya in 1965 (when  he became prime minister after his Justice Party won a landslide  in the elections) that everyone should proudly declare they are  Muslims in Turkey. If a person is saying he is a Muslim with  pride or if he is calling God's name, there is nothing  anti-secular about all this. Why should some people regard it  as an anti-secular act if people pray, go to the mosque, listen  to prayers or if God's name is chanted? In Britain their  national anthem says "God save the Queen" and the American  dollar bears the writing "In God we trust."  <H5>  Religion and Politics </H5>   Demirel said the exploitation of religion by politicians is  nothing new in human history. "The fact that some people try to  exploit the religious feelings of the people is nothing new for  the world or for Turkey. You should remember that for the past  40 years, since we switched to a multi-party system, we have  been struggling for this in Turkey. I was the one who urged  everyone not to bring religion into the schools, the mosques or  the military barracks. I was also the one who urged everyone to  proudly announce they are Muslims."    Demirel said if people want to pray, they should go to the  mosque. He pointed out that there are 65,000 mosques and 83,000  Muslim clergy in Turkey who are ready to serve the public. "If  the imams (Muslim clergy) who preach at mosques try to  indoctrinate people with daily politics, they will split the  congregation because daily politics changes overnight while even  a single comma in God's teachings does not change." Demirel  said Muslim preachers have to use the teachings of God and  nothing else. "If you carry the issues being discussed in  newspapers to the mosque, then you will only divide the people.  However, Islam rejects division and discord. I want to declare  clearly that exploiting religion for political gains is discord  and whoever does this is seriously harming religion."  <H5>  Secularism and Turkey </H5>   Demirel said it is impossible for anyone to reject  secularism  in Turkey but stressed the conditions in Turkey had changed  between the early years of the republic and now. "I think the  application of secularism in the 1930s was a bit mistaken.  People may have been satisfied with the application of  secularism at the time. Some people may not have liked this,  but we have to accept things according to the conditions of  those times. There were claims that Islam was an obstacle to  development while secularism was seen as atheism. Those were  also the times when Marxism was spreading throughout most of the  world and Marxist ideology regarded religion as the opium of the  masses. So it is hard to say Turkey could remain far apart from  the influences of these trends."    The president said at first Turkey did not start off as a  secular state. He pointed out that the first 1924 Constitution  said the religion of the Turkish Republic is Islam and this was  dropped in 1928 and until 1937 there was no mention of  secularism in the constitution.    Demirel said when he came to power as prime minister, he  managed to explain to the people what secularism was. "We  understood what secularism was and we managed to convey this to  the people. Secularism is not against Islam. A person who  fulfills the requirements of Islam should not complain about  secularism as secularism is not against beliefs, does not  prevent people from praying and does not obstruct religious  education. [no closing quotations marks as published]    The head of state says debate on religion in Turkey dates  back to 150 years. "The people running the Ottoman empire  sought the reasons why we could not progress while we were left  backward and while we were alienated from the other countries in  Europe. I support the view that religion is not an obstacle for  Turkey's development. Secularism does not prevent people from  fulfilling their religious rights. If a person says he is a  Muslim, he does not violate secularism. But if people use the  name of God, the Koran and the name of the Prophet to win  sympathy from people and to exploit people's feelings for  personal gains, then they are committing a sin. I say people  should call God's name only in appropriate places and times.  When you start doing something, do it in the name of God, call  God's name whenever you feel like it. That is up to the  individual. But, when you turn all this into an instrument for  showing off and when you try to derive some benefits out of all  this, then you are committing a great sin. We have tried to  spread these views in Turkey, and we have eased some of the  tension in the past."  <H5>  Fundamentalism in Turkey </H5>   Asked if Turkey would become a fundamentalist state, Demirel  said that before anything we should understand what  fundamentalism is. "What do we have to do to transform Turkey  into a fundamentalist state? First, you have to change the  Constitution. There is an article which defines the state  system in Turkey. You have to change that article. You have to  change the principle in the Constitution that the Turkish  Republic is a secular, democratic and social state based on  laws. So you have to take out the word `secular' and insert  that the Turkish Republic is a state based on religion. That  would mean you would be going back to 1924 and 1928. Turkey went  through an evolution and social incidents do not work backwards  but, on the contrary, they move forwards."    Demirel said when people try to turn the Turkish Republic  into a fundamentalist state, they have to change the laws as  well as the Constitution. "They have to transform the laws of  the Turkish Republic according to the teachings of the Koran but  which teachings?"    The president explained that the Koran deals with five  basic areas. He said the first area is to do with believing in  God. This covers the belief that God is one and that Hz.  [Prophet] Muhammad is his prophet. Whoever believes in this is  a Muslim.    Demirel explained that the second area is praying and  worshiping. This includes praying, fasting, helping the poor and  the needy and going to Mecca for pilgrimage. If a person does  not do these things or does them partially, then he or she will  be committing a sin. "If you beg for forgiveness, God, which is  merciful, will forgive you. In the teachings of the Koran it  says you may be committing many sins but one good action may  wipe away all the sins. You may not be aware that you have done  a good deed, but God knows and will forgive you for all your  sins. So it is all between God and the individual." The third  area is punishment in the world. The Koran does not only define  the day of judgement but it also defines how people will be  punished if they violate the rights of others. "If you steal,  you will be punished. So the Koran also specifies punishments  for various crimes."    The fourth area in the Koran defines "procedures" for  earthly  issues. It sets rules for relations between individuals, the  relationship between men and women, the rules of marriage and  divorce and alimony as well as inheritance.    The fifth area is "morality." It sets the rules of what is  good and what is bad. It urges people to behave well, not to  lie, to help one another, not to cheat. "These are all rules of  morality which no civilized person would reject."    "Now let us look at all these five areas and see if  secularism is an obstacle for any of them. Secularism does not  prohibit belief in God or the Prophet. Neither does secularism  obstruct praying and worshipping. Regarding the third and  fourth areas which the Koran covers on punishment and other  legal arrangements, we see that in Turkey we have the penal code  and the civil code. So when you have fundamentalism you will  annul these laws and replace them with the punishments and other  legal arrangements specified in the Koran. So if you do not do  this will that country we regarded as a non-Muslim state? Won't  they regard Turkey as a Muslim country? We regard a Muslim  country as a country where the majority of the people are  believers in Islam. A secular state is a state where secularism  works like an umbrella over religion and where there is no  obstructions and repression against religion."    Demirel said that for Turkey to become a fundamentalist  state  first its proponents have to obtain the powers to be able to  change the constitution. "But the Turkish people are satisfied  with secularism because it does not prevent them from praying,  it does not interfere in their beliefs, it does not say `be a  bad person and do not obey the teachings of the Koran to be  honest' and it has adopted the rules of the Koran on punishments  and legal arrangements according to the requirements of  contemporary times. All this was done way back in 1926 and no  one objected to it. In the past 68 years there have been no  claims that because Turkey changed its laws it committed a crime  against the Koran and that Turks became non-Muslims."  <H5>  The Nation Rules </H5>   Demirel pointed out that the Koran refers to "the rule of  God" and that some people say, "You cannot talk about national  will and the rule of the people because there is only the rule  of God." The president said that this point needed clarifying.  "We agree that the ultimate right to rule belongs to God. But  the rule of God is universal, while there is also `partial'  rule. In Islamic thinking, the right of a nation to rule itself  is not against the divine orders of God. As a matter of fact,  both our Prophet and the caliphates that came after him have run  the state. If a person runs a country according to the divine  orders of God, he does not violate God's will and the universal  rule of God. Many times [in] the Koran God tells Muslims to  `rule a country through justice.' God also says, `Give the  right to rule to those who are capable.' Here we see that God  wants the people to be ruled by the people. So, if you hand  power over to those who are capable of running a country, then  you are fulfilling God's wishes. So when you say, `Be just and  give power to those capable of ruling, can this be regarded as  fundamentalism? No it cannot. Can people claim this exists in  the Koran and that we are not obeying it? Of course not. If we  act as God wishes, can people claim we are fundamentalists?"    Demirel said that no one in Turkey demands a fundamentalist  order, "while there are some who want Shari'ah (Islamic law) and  these people are rather vague about what they really want...."  Demirel admitted that Turkey had adopted the criminal, civil,  commerce and inheritance codes of the West, saying that this may  have been regarded as ignoring the principles of Islam. "Yet no  one can say such a country is not Muslim. On the contrary,  Turkey is the leading Islamic country."    Demirel said that none of the 55 Islamic countries had ever  claimed that Turkey was not an Islamic country. The president  stressed that Turkey today is a country run by liberal policies,  liberal economic principles, secularism and the law. He  emphasized that the country had not only preserved its national  values and its identity, but had also respected universal  values. He said that Turkey accepted globalism, as well as  international peace and cooperation. "None of these contradict  Turkey's Muslim identity. Turkey has to live up to all these  principles and values." "I have asked a series of questions. I  asked myself and several other people, how can you set up a  state based on Islamic principles? Can the Koran and the  teachings of the Prophet be the principles of a state? Don't  democracy and secularism fulfill the requirements of the Koran  and the teachings of the Prophet? What do the Koran and the  teachings of the Prophet call for? How did Turkey in the past,  and how do the present 55 Islamic countries try to adapt their  state systems to the Koran and the teachings of the Prophet? I  have come to the conclusion that all past and present states  have tried to adapt the requirements of Islam to the realities  of their times. Thus the demands of those who call for Islamic  law and order have never been realized. This is called  `political Islam.' It is called `political Islam and  traditionalist law.' Is there anything preventing us from  practising our faith in the present order in Turkey? Of course  not."    Demirel warned that there were those in Turkey who hurt the  religious feelings of the people. "Certain people are trying to  make every action seem as though it were directed against  secularism. This harms religious feeling, provoking a reaction  among the people. If you allow people to practice their  religion they will not seek new avenues. But if you do not,  then there will be those who claim to be the voice of the  believers. In 1977 I spoke at rallies and told the people that  there were people claiming to be their voice. So I asked them,  `Does anyone prevent you from going to the mosque or attending  prayers? If you want to recite the Koran, is there anyone who  tries to prevent you from doing so? If there are such people, I  will overcome them."    Demirel said it is impossible to say that the state system  in  Turkey has been set up according to the principles of the Koran.  Yet, he added that it is also wrong to say Turkey is not a  Muslim country.    "We can say that while in Turkey we have fulfilled three of  the main principles of Islam which are to believe in God and the  Prophet, to worship and to promote morality, we have also  adapted the Koranic rules on punishment and conduct to the  requirements of our times. For example, the Koran says if a  person steals something, then you should sever his arm. Yet  Prophet Omer changed that rule and gave a different punishment  because he said we need the arm of the man to plough in the  fields and to fight in wars. In the Koran it says you have to  kill a person who murders another person. But later the Koran  also says if the relatives of the murdered person forgives the  killer, then they get blood money. As you see the Koran is  always reasonable."    Demirel said the people in general are rather uninformed  about religion and secularism. "Those who defend secularism  don't know anything about religion, and those who support  religion don't know anything about secularism."    The president said there is no reason why anyone should have  any doubts that Turkey may become a fundamentalist state.  "About 72 percent of our population is under the age of 35, and  it is very hard to steer these people this way or that way.  These people have tasted what a secular republic is and what  democracy is. These people have not lost their religion.  Religion is there and so is secularism. So there is no reason  for anyone to fear that Turkey may become another Algeria."    Demirel said a majority of the nation is happy with  secularism while he said there are also those who are not.  "This is nothing new. These people have been complaining about  secularism for the past century. The debate on this subject has  been going on since Turkey became a secular country. In the  Ottoman era there were those who were saying religion is an  obstacle for development. Among the Republican intellectuals  there are those who do not know about religious principles and  who regard secularism as unlimited freedom. I have studied all  these at length, and I concluded that secularism does not mean  atheism. In Turkey, religion belongs to the people and the  individuals. I say give the people the freedom to believe in  God."    Asked if the model in Turkey could also help the West  overcome the fears of spread of fundamentalism in the world, the  president said, "Absolutely. Fundamentalism is being debated  throughout the world. Some people call it, `the revenge of  God.'" Actually secularism is not our invention. It has come  about in Europe because of the struggle between the church and  the state. Demirel pointed out that unlike the church the  Muslim faith is not organized. "Only the Shiites are organized.  We do not have that. Our Prophet told his people that he is  only charged with giving God's messages to the people. God says  the Prophet is his envoy to present the message. God says the  Prophet will give the message and then it is up to the believers  whether or not they will obey. If they do not obey, then it is  a matter between God and the individual. So it is meaningless  if individuals oppose secularism under these conditions. So if  a man says he is a believer, we should tell him to worship God  but also ask him not to interfere in the lifestyle of others.  The Koran says: `Nothing will be done under pressure in the  Muslim faith.'"</p>

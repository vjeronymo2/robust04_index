			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / International Company News: ITT improves 27% in spite of catastrophe loss ITT, the US conglomerate, yesterday reported a 27 per cent rise in first-quarter net income, thanks to sharply better performances at its finance, automotive and hotels businesses. The improvement came in spite of Dollars 41m of extraordinary catastrophe losses at its ITT Hartford insurance subsidiary, due to a severe winter storm and the February bombing of New York's World Trade Center, and a drop in after-tax portfolio gains at Hartford and ITT Financial to Dollars 42m from Dollars 84m. Net income totalled Dollars 175m, or Dollars 1.30 a share fully diluted, compared with net income of Dollars 138m, or Dollars 1, in the same period of last year, excluding accounting changes. Sales were static at Dollars 5.1bn. The figures were at the upper end of analysts' expectations and ITT shares rose Dollars 2 1/8 in morning trading on the New York stock exchange to stand at Dollars 80 3/4 . ITT Financial, which was the subject of a Dollars 612m fourth-quarter after-tax restructuring charge, reported income of Dollars 67m, up from Dollars 32m, due to lower loss provisions and borrowing costs. The automotive business saw income rise to Dollars 32m from Dollars 19m, following 'cost improvement actions,' while the Sheraton Hotels group transformed a Dollars 16m loss into Dollars 16m of profits, helped by 'higher occupancy and rates, particularly in the renovated New York city properties and significantly lower overhead expenses'. ITT Hartford reported income of Dollars 156m, down from Dollars 168m, though excluding portfolio gains and extraordinary losses the business had improved operating results.</p>

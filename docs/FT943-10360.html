			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / Observer: Party time Remember the end of the 1980s, when the investment banking boutiques were meant to be the way of the future on Wall Street? Well, it didn't turn out that way. The tide of deals ebbed, and most companies showed a preference for the big Wall Street houses, which can finance as well as advise on a deal. Now a new wave of mega-deals in the US is bringing some of the boutiques back into the limelight. This week it was the turn of Eric Gleacher, a former head of takeovers at Morgan Stanley and, before that, Lehman Brothers. Gleacher went out on his own four years ago, and has barely been heard of since. Gleacher is the mastermind behind American Home Products' hostile run at American Cyanamid. The folks at Morgan Grenfell in London are pretty chuffed by this, since Gleacher is their main corporate finance outlet on Wall Street. But with Dollars 8.5bn of cash to raise to back the bid, the betting is that a bigger Wall Street firm, with underwriting and distribution power, will soon get in on the act too. Could this be the cue for Morgan Grenfell's parent, Deutsche Bank, to throw its hat in the ring?</p>

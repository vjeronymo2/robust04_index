			<p><P> July 19, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 24-HOUR STAFFING OF KENNELS SUGGESTED  </P> <P> Responding to the death of 35 pets in a July 4 kennel fire in Pasadena, Los  Angeles County supervisors Tuesday ordered animal control officials to study  requiring round-the-clock staffing in kennels.  </P> <P> Supervisor Mike Antonovich, who asked for the study, has pneumonia and was  absent from the meeting. His staff issued a statement saying that while the  Pasadena kennel was absolved of any blame in the fire, "it is quite possible  that some of the animals could have been saved had a kennel attendant or other  employee been on duty."  </P> <P> County law prohibits anyone from leaving a dog unattended for more than 12  hours. However, the statement said, "at times, such as the Fourth of July, when  large numbers of pets are boarded for the holiday, the potential for disaster  increases dramatically."  </P> <P> Bruce Richards, assistant animal control director for the county, said that his  office already has received complaints from kennel owners about the increased  cost of the proposed requirement and is studying mandating sprinkler systems in  kennels as an alternative.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Pak Tu-sik] </F>   [Text] In the sixth working-level contact held at  Panmunjom on 12 March to discuss the South-North envoy exchange,  North Korea demanded that the two sides adopt a South-North  joint communique. Pak Yong-su, chief delegate of the North side,  abruptly insisted on "issuing a joint communique expressing both  sides' intent before adopting an agreement for exchanging  special envoys of South and North Korea." At the same time,  North Korea "virtually" withdrew its demand for four  preconditions of the envoy exchange. The four preconditions,  including the abrogation of President Kim Yong-sam's remarks on  the North's nuclear development, were nothing but "North Korea's  devices" aimed at delaying the envoy exchange. It seems that  North Korea is insisting on announcing a joint communique  "hinting that South-North contacts for the envoy exchange are  going smoothly" after allowing itself to withdraw the delaying  devices because it wants to pave the way for the third round of  North Korean-U.S. high-level talks, which will be held in about  a week.    In other words, North Korea intends to make it difficult for  the ROK and U.S. Governments to postpone the third round of  talks, and it also intends to create a pretext for spurning  responsibility on the other side when the talks are actually  delayed.    Despite this effort by North Korea, it seems almost  impossible for the third round of talks that are slated to be  held in Geneva on 21 March, to go on as scheduled. Robert  Gallucci, assistant secretary of state for political and  military affairs and head of the U.S. delegation to North  Korea-U.S. talks, clearly said that "the third round of talks  will not be held unless the South-North envoy exchange is  realized" in a series of consultations with the ROK Government  before he left the ROK on 13 March.    Of course, the ROK and U.S. Government authorities have not  made the delay of 21 March North Korean-U.S. talks an  established fact because, from a logical point of view, it is  possible that after South and North Korea dramatically reach an  agreement in their next contact slated for 16 March, either  side's envoy will visit the other side before the 21 March  Geneva talks. However, this can hardly become reality.  Accordingly, the ROK and U.S. Governments seem to be making a  policy in preparation for the possible delay of the third round  of North Korean-U.S. talks in consequence of failure to exchange  South and North Korean envoys prior to 21 March.    As has been well known, the ROK and the United States have  demanded the inspection by the International Atomic Energy  Agency [IAEA] and the South-North envoy exchange as  preconditions of the third round of North Korean-U.S. talks.  The IAEA inspection is a precondition that can immediately  result in international society's intervention such as sanctions  by the UN Security Council. Time has proven that IAEA  inspections of North Korea are being conducted at an acceptable  level. If the IAEA inspection is completed satisfactorily  before the end of this week, only the issue of envoy exchange  will remain unresolved.    It is the ROK and U.S. Governments' position that the third  round of North Korean-U.S. talks cannot be held unless the envoy  exchange is realized. If North Korean-U.S. talks, slated for 21  March, are delayed, North Korea will be held responsible for  that since it has delayed the envoy exchange. Accordingly,  North Korea is being pressed for time while the ROK and the  United States comes into a composed position. The government  plans to continue to promote the envoy exchange with patience  even if it is not realized before 21 March. If it becomes  completely impossible for North Korea and the United States to  hold high-level talks on 21 March, the United States will  probably notify North Korea of the delay of the third round of  talks through the New York channel around 16 March, when the  next South-North contact will be held. The third round of North  Korean-U.S. talks are likely to be delayed until after mid-April  because the South-North envoy exchange should be realized before  the talks.    This can be expected, however, only when North Korea gently  accedes to the envoy exchange, even if it is late, as well as  agrees to the delay of the North Korean-U.S. high-level talks.  If North Korea strongly opposes this, it is possible that the  North Korean nuclear issue will again temporarily fall into a  phase of harsh confrontation. If IAEA inspections uncover a  "serious-level" of diversion of nuclear materials for other  purposes, that may bring about full-pledged intervention by the  international community.</p>

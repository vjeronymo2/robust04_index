			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / UK Gilts: No sign of let-up in rally THE RISE in the gilt market shows little sign of running out of steam. As investors continued to buy the securities on hopes of lower interest rates across Europe, 25-year dated gilts ended the week at their best levels for 25 years. The 0.25 percentage point fall in yields for longer-dated securities illustrated the perception in financial markets that, after the remodelling of the European exchange rate mechanism, there will be plenty of room for UK borrowing rates to ease by the end of the year. While the September long gilt future was on Friday night quoted at 111 15/32 , close to a record, London share prices ended the week at a new high. The FT-SE 100 index closed up 26.4 points on the day, at 2,969.8, topping the previous record close of 2,957.3. The unusual event of the two markets being close to a peak at the same time underlines the belief that inflationary pressures are becoming less of a problem. According to this thinking, the UK government might be able to bring down base rates from 6 per cent, without worrying that extra demand would feed into rising prices for goods and services. Behind the events of the past week, in which medium-dated gilts have climbed nearly 2 points, is the feeling that the new 15 per cent bands in the ERM will allow large cuts in interest rates across continental Europe. Government bonds across Europe have risen as a result, with the biggest gainers being gilts and Spanish and Italian securities. Non-UK institutions were big buyers of gilts last week. This was on the view that sterling was likely to gain in the short run from not being a member of the mechanism. The lack of action by continental European governments in cutting interest rates last week was seen as only temporary. It was thought countries such as France, Denmark and Belgium will want to pause for breath before easing monetary conditions and risking a further fall in their currencies. With 10-year gilt yields finishing the week at around 7.1 per cent, and 25-year yields at 7.6 per cent, the market was barely disturbed by news of a Pounds 1.5bn gilt issue from the Bank of England. The gilts go on sale from today and comprise Pounds 1bn of partly-paid 8.5 per cent Treasury loan stock due 2007 at a price of 108.50 per cent; Pounds 100m of 7.75 per cent Treasury loan stock due 2012 to 2015; Pounds 200m of 2.5 per cent index-linked Treasury stock due 2013; and Pounds 200m of 2.5 per cent index-linked Treasury stock maturing 2024. Some market participants have been depressed by worries about the large issues of gilts to finance the expected Pounds 50bn government deficit this financial year. However, Mr Michael Rosenberg, head of international fixed-income research at Merrill Lynch says: 'Concerns about budget deficits are unlikely to have much of an effect on bond markets while inflation trends are thought to be sound.' This week a raft of data will shed more light on the degree of demand in the UK economy and consequent inflationary pressures. Figures today will indicate how much new credit consumers took on in June, with the market believing this will be about Pounds 170m. Concerns about the strength of the upturn are reflected in forecasts for manufacturing output, with the City expecting a month-on-month fall of 0.6 per cent in June. However, this would partly reflect a strong May figure, when output rose 1.8 per cent on the month. The manufacturing figures will be released on Thursday, as will labour market data for June and July.</p>

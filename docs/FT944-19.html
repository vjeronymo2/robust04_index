			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Outdoors: No turkey on the final leg - FT Ski Expedition / Arnie Wilson misses the traditional fare as his odyssey nears its end Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker spent Christmas in Utah, as they near the end of their round-the-world trip. Christmas Day at Snowbird in Utah dawned as bright and tingling as a TV toothpaste advert and our first Noel on skis was superb. The only disappointment was the complete lack of traditional Christmas fare. Still, Dick Bass, the garrulous Texan oil millionaire who built the Snowbird resort more than 20 years ago, rang us - very early - from his home in Dallas with recommended restaurants. Any man prepared to host us for a week over Christmas and take us skiing on one of America's finest mountains on the 8am tram, before any holidaymakers are allowed up the mountain, can call us any time he pleases. Before arriving in Utah, we had been at Jackson Hole, where a party was held in our honour. We began our odyssey in Jackson Hole on January 1. And just as he had promised, John Resor, the chief executive of Jackson Hole Ski Corporation invited us and 38 guests - including Jay and Connie Kemmerer, the ski resort owners - to his home in Teton Village to welcome us back. The following day it was back to business: Lucy rashly suggested that we should celebrate our return to Jackson by trying to break our record for the number of vertical feet skied in one day. Nine rides up Rendezvous Mountain in Jackson's Red Tram (cable car) would do it. But we aimed for 10, which would give us a total of 42,000 vertical feet (about 35 miles). By coincidence, we were due to be accompanied by Richard Edwards, Ski Scott Dunn's representative in Jackson, who had kept us company last April when we set up our previous record of 34,000ft at Champery in Switzerland. Unhappily, Edwards - steaming down through the trees with us in Wally World during our first descent, hooked a ski in deep powder and gashed his eyebrow bad-ly. We eventually managed our 10 trams with minutes to spare, but Richard's injury rather cooled our elation and made us realise how fortunate we had both been to escape serious injury this year. One step Jackson is taking to make skiing safer is to install 'restraints' (safety guards) on its lifts. For years American ski areas have had an ambivalent attitude towards these, arguing that they sometimes caused more accidents than they prevent. But Jackson Hole has finally come round to thinking they are a good idea. In America, skiers are discouraged from jumping from lifts with such signs as 'Do not jump from lift - survivors will be prosecuted'. From Jackson we drove 300 miles to Salt Lake City to investigate Wolf Mountain and Robert Redford's resort, Sundance. Wolf Mountain used to be called Park West but is being completely revamped. Its trails are now linked with threatened species, with names such as Cheetah, Red Kangaroo, Rattlesnake and Red Wolf Bowl. In a state which by and large bans snowboarders, Wolf is out to be the snowboarding capital of Utah, thus making skiers a threatened species too. Inevitably Sundance, Redford's charming resort in the shadow of Mount Timpanogos (12,000ft) the highest peak in Utah's Wasatch Range, has Butch Cassidy connotations which rather belie the beauty and tranquillity of this spectacular canyon. There are runs called Outlaw, Maverick, Stampede, Badlands, Quickdraw and Top Gun. Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker stayed at The Inn at Teton Village, Jackson Hole, Wyoming. In Utah they stayed at the Olympus Hotel, 161 West 600 South, Salt Lake City, The Mandan cottages at Sundance and the Silver King Resort Hotel, 1485, Empire Avenue, Park City. They spent Christmas at The Cliff Lodge at Snowbird, Utah.</p>

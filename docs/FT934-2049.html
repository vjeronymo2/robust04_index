			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / Gatt chief brings down the gavel on world trade treaty Delegations from 117 countries yesterday approved by consensus an ambitious world trade liberalisation treaty aimed at slashing tariffs and opening markets. Seven years of tough negotiations came to a successful finale when Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade declared: 'I gavel the Uruguay Round concluded.' Delegates at Geneva's International Conference Centre came to their feet, cheered and applauded. Officials broke open bottles of champagne. Mr Sutherland brought down the gavel after European Union foreign ministers in Brussels removed the final obstacle by approving the accord. The French national assembly later gave a vote of confidence to prime minister Edouard Balladur, who had dropped French objections to a deal. In Washington, President Bill Clinton said the agreement was a good one even though the US did not get all it wanted. He would notify Congress before the midnight deadline that he would sign it. A few hundred bedraggled farmers demonstrated in Paris and Brussels, branding the deal a US plot to cut European farming. In South Korea, prime minister Hwang In-sung submitted his resignation to President Kim Young-sam shortly after police arrested hundreds of students protesting against the country's acceptance of rice imports. The 550-page trade pact will result in tariffs being cut world-wide by an average of 40 per cent and will bring trade in agriculture, services, and textiles and garments under multilateral discipline for the first time. It also creates a more powerful body, the World Trade Organisation, to replace Gatt. The agreement will take effect in 1995 after governments have ratified it. Mr Sutherland said the accord was 'a momentous and historic achievement' that would mean 'more trade, more investment, more jobs and larger income growth for all'. EU foreign ministers, approving the deal, partly met French demands for strengthened trade defence mechanisms. They also agreed to satisfy Portuguese insistence on aid to modernise its textiles industry. An Ecu900m (Pounds 690m) package, including Ecu400m drawn from the existing structural funds budget, is to be made available over the next six years. Amid the euphoria, there was disappointment that the agreement was marred by US reservations on financial services, and irreconcilable US-EU differences over access to Europe's film and television sectors and over shipping and telecommunications. It is hoped these disputes can be settled in the next two years. Many developing countries were also disappointed by the modest market-opening offers from industrial countries.

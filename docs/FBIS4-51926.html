			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Eijiro Hata, minister of the Ministry of </F> International Trade and Industry, by unidentified YOMIURI  SHIMBUN reporter; place and date not given]    [Text] [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] How do you plan to tackle the  issue of resuming the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks?    [Hata] Since Prime Minister Hata was still in his post as  foreign minister, he has tried to make contacts with the United  States by taking advantage of various opportunities and making  full use of his personal connections. From now on, it will be  necessary for all the cabinet members to make use of all  connections.    [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] What will be the measures to deal with  numerical targets that the United States has demanded?    [Hata] While insisting on the basic stand on never accepting  this demand, we will continue to make efforts to seek consensus  through positive talks.    [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Do you have any apprenhensions about the  fact that the cabinet is now a minority-ruled administration?    [Hata] In actuality, there is no denying that the minority  ruling coalition lacks strength. However, even opposition  parties cannot ignore public opinion. Therefore, it is  necessary for us to persist in promoting policies that can win  public support. One of the major tasks lies in creating  conditions so that the Social Democratic Party of Japan can be  asked to rejoin the coalition.    [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] It has been pointed out that one  characteristic of the Japanese economy is "dango [bid-rigging]."  What do you think of it?    [Hata] I understand that the point at issue lies in the fact  that some deviation is inevitable when an economic act that has  long been practiced in Japan is viewed from the standpoint of  foreign nations. In promoting economic reform or working out  deregulation, we will have to make dynamic efforts to create a  free and unfettered economic environment.    [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] What do you think of criticism against  bureaucrats?    [Hata] To put it in another way, they may speak for Japanese  bureaucrats' excellent capabilities because they possess not  only professional knowledge but also strong administrative  ability. In conducting political affairs, we must base our  position on a broad standpoint sometimes and view things from an  extensive viewpoint at other times. And what is important is  that concerted actions are taken [by politicians and  bureaucrats]. Nevertheless, it is essential for politicians to  take up full responsibilities.</p>

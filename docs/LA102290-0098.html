			<p><P> October 22, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SHORT CUTS TO FASHION FOR THOSE OVER 40  </P> <P> Thierry Mugler has a motto: "Too much is just enough." And he pushes it to the  limit in his spring 1991 fashion collection. His show was the first to get  people talking during a week of ready-to-wear collections that ends Wednesday.  </P> <P> With Madonna and Grace Jones in the audiences Thursday night, and with Diana  Ross and Mick Jaggar's daughter, Jade, modeling, Mugler's newest styles had  some tough competition.  </P> <P> But they were up to the challenge. Steel-tip bra tops, bikini pant suits,  towering platform shoes, patent leather short shorts, stretch vinyl leggings  and itsy-bitsy body suits are just the start of this over-the-top collection.  </P> <P> Celebrity models Lauren Hutton and Iman proved just how good these body  grippers can look on women older than 40 who stay in shape.  </P> <P> Before the show, Mugler announced that he will launch his first new fragrance.  Too bad he didn't have a few bottles on hand to bribe his show's security  guards, who somehow managed to keep ticket-holders outside but let  gate-crashers in. Even Mugler's designer chum, Azzedine Alaia, didn't make the  cut.  </P> <P> This was the first of several fights to break out during fashion week. Another  started Saturday at the Claude Montana show, when Elsa Klensch, whose cable  television fashion show is a favorite among fashion buffs, found someone  sitting in her assigned seat. The noisy exhibition tent fell silent as a  security guard was called. Klensch and her adversary both refused to budge.  Finally, an usher brought in an extra chair and set it up in the aisle. Klensch  got her seat, the other woman moved to the new one.  </P> <P> That same day, New York magazine reporter Michael Gross made headlines in  Women's Wear Daily for having switched the seating chart at the John Galiano  show earlier in the week.  </P> <P> Gross had moved his place card to the first row and moved WWD publisher John  Fairchild's back to row two. A story about it appeared on WWD's gossip page.  Headline: "Grossed Out."  </P> <P> Montana's show was one of the best so far. He showed satin evening dresses with  asymmetric hems and silver hard wear that were perfect. An ivory-colored trench  coat, short in front and long in back, has wide sashes at the cuff that prove  glamorous and romantic at the same time. A series of beaded body suits with  white linen skirts or shorts is the best answer of the season for day or night  dressing. There was not one mistake or disappointment in this show.  </P> <P> Meantime, there were a few ideas basic to many collections. Body suits and  leggings, short shorts and short dresses were the main ideas.  </P> <P> Yohji Yamamoto calls his little black slip dresses with the split skirts,  "nighties for the '90s." And they double as underwear.  </P> <P> His black body suits that extend to the knee are also a type of underwear,  because he treats them as a first layer of clothing. Over some he puts white  linen skirts or apron dresses suspended from strings reminiscent of  clothesline; over others he puts open-weave dresses, nipped at the waist and  worn several inches shorter than the body suit beneath that shows through like  a graceful shadow.  </P> <P> Yamamoto's female fashion counterpart, Rei Kawakubo for comme Des Garcons, who  is also Japanese-born and Paris-based, shows ankle-grazing shift dresses in  semi-sheer print fabric over red or blue body suits. Hers are more like jump  suits; they don't fit like a second skin.  </P> <P> Happily, the surreal details Kawakubo adds in most of her collections are not  part of her new spring line. No sleeves dangling from skirts, no hoods  suspended from bodices. This new direction is toward more wearable feminine  fashion.  </P> <P> Karl Lagerfeld, first to lift leggings to haute couture status with his Chanel  collections of last year, features leggings again this season in his own  signature line.  </P> <P> They look newest when he puts them under sequined evening wear, especially his  body-conscious T-shirt dresses, or open-back trapeze-shape tops and mini  skirts. They are always thick, usually black or navy, Capri length and worn  with the heel-less ankle boots that Lagerfeld uses throughout his spring  collection.  </P> <P> Other current-minded looks for night are pastel print leggings cut to mid-calf,  topped with multilayer shirts or tunics in sheer versions of the same print  fabric. It is an energetic collection that blends Lagerfeld's strong sense of  street fashion with his sure-handed use of couture details.  </P> <P> Lagerfeld uses cycle shorts as suit bottoms to go with fitted jackets cut waist  length in front, dipping longer in back.  </P> <P> Nino Cerruti builds pant suits from cycle shorts, too. He adds a tunic and long  swing jacket. Jacqueline Jacobson, the Dorothee Bis designer, puts shorts under  knee-baring trapeze dresses made of semi-sheer fabric so the shorts show  through.  </P> <P> Mugler and Alaia had a chance to make up at the Jean Paul Gaultier show Friday  night. They talked across the aisle to each other. (It's not unusual for  designers to attend each other's shows in Paris, although in New York, it's  all-but-unheard of; somehow, in the Big Apple, it's implied, you're there to  steal ideas, not show support.)  </P> <P> Romantic love was the theme at Gaultier's show, attend by Madonna and Catherine  Deneuve. There were rose pedals scattered on the floor, bird calls filled the  air, and the first models were an Adam and Eve of the '90s. He wore sheer  tights and a fig leaf, she wore a serpent bra.  </P> <P> Things got really rowdy after that. Clothes were modeled by couples or  sometimes ambiguously related trios. Men wore wigs -- black dreadlocks or pink  Louis XIV styles. And they wore daffodil-yellow suits with matching  cowboy-style neck kerchiefs, or sarong-skirted suits in men's wear fabrics, an  idea Gaultier has played with for years.  </P> <P> Women wore sarong skirts in men's wear fabric, too -- or men's wear fabric  jackets over ruffled cyclist shorts.  </P> <P> The '60s revival styles in the collection look right, updated with newer  fabrics and shapes. White vinyl T-shirts and banker gray suits are winners.  </P> <P> Showpieces include a coat for romantic-minded career women, which was navy blue  pin stripe to the waist with a burst of navy blue tulle from there to the  floor. The clear vinyl matador's jacket embroidered in gold and jewels was the  men's wear item of flamboyant choice.  </P> <P> "We have sold four of them at $10,000 each, and we don't even have them in the  store yet, only photographs," said Barbara Weiser after the Gaultier show.  Weiser, an owner of Charivari, the New York boutique chain, and other retailers  visiting Paris admit to being worried.  </P> <P> Recession talk has them debating whether to stock up on classic clothes with  long-wearing life spans or choose the more extraordinary items.  </P> <P> "Not everyone wants classic clothes, cutting-edge avant garde is what goes with  some peoples' personality," said Tommy Perse, who owns Maxfield in Los Angeles,  with his wife, Ann Marie. Maxfield will carry a certain amount of modern  classic clothing, Perse said. But more than that, he added, "We're looking for  the new."  </P> <P> Joan Kaner, senior vice president and fashion director of Nieman Marcus, said,  "We'll buy the show pieces," then added, "We're likely to cut back and buy  less."  </P> <P> Kal Ruttenstein of Bloomingdales said, "I need impulse buys at $1,500. The  economy is frightening, but to buy classics for our customers doesn't work.  They want fashion."  </P> <P> At the Issey Miyake show, there was some of both. Classic Miyake are shaped  dresses in tiny-pleat fabric. This time, the sleeves are shaped like question  marks until the wearer pushes them up, to find that they wrap and pleat around  the arm like modern sculpture. The "dinosaur" jacket of wire-framed fabric has  an armor-plate appearance. It folds into a reptile shape you can put on the  coffee table.  </P> <P> Black rubber tank tops, ruffled body suits teamed with vests made entirely of  canvas pouches, and a honeycomb evening outfit that Miyake compares to ribbon,  established the designer's unique vision. Yet the clothes in this collection  are completely wearable.  </P> <P> "Certainly there is a recession," Miyake said after his show.  </P> <P> "You see it all over the world. And yes, store owners are worried. But I am a  designer, my duty is to show what is contemporary and what is the future. If  designers look back, we get left behind."  </P></p>

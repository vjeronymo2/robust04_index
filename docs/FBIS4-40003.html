			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Vyacheslav Pikhovshek: "The `Great Seven' at </F> the Finish of the Presidential Marathon"]    [Text] The presidential elections, in addition to their  direct results (after all, we will have a new guarantor of our  statehood), will become a universal sociological survey of  Ukrainian citizens' moods, particularly during the first round,  since everybody will have the opportunity to elect a suitable  man. Only Lanovyy and Babych seem to be similar to each other;  Plyushch, Kuchma, Moroz, Talanchuk, and, of course, the current  president can be easily distinguished one from another.    It is impossible to analyze the candidates' chances of being  elected for the highest state office without reviewing the  latest steps taken by our heroes.  <H5>  Leonid Kravchuk </H5>   Obviously, he has recently met with misfortune. There was a  time when Leonid Makarovych [Kravchuk] lived in three dimensions  -- simultaneously, he would state that it is impossible for him  to personally participate in the presidential race, insist on  the need to postpone the presidential elections, and collect  signatures as a presidential candidate -- which is the  elementary behavior of a politician for whom power is above  everything. Since the elections will be held anyway, even after  numerous "appeals by company staffs" and during "the battle for  crops" and "the winter-summer period of production," Leonid  Makarovych has begun to "flex his muscles," and, undoubtedly, he  will offer citizens a whole range of diplomatic successes and  market-oriented speeches, award farm workers, disclose some  unlucky Mafioso, stigmatize separatists, publish a book about  fertile blacklands and colorful placards with his autographs,  and, in general, he will do a lot of pleasing things which are  so characteristic of him. Currently, there is a "time of work"  for Kravchuk, and his victory is not as obvious as it was in  1990, since the following man has become a destabilizer in his  triumphant march:  <H5>  Ivan Plyushch </H5>   Even though the two men still shake hands publicly, the  straightforward Ivan Stepanovych [Plyushch] has recently stated  that he had "a secular" conversation with Leonid Makarovych,  explaining that, as he understands the word, "secularism" is  when one says what should be said, but not what one thinks.  Plyushch is currently trying to outmaneuver the president in  everything, since after the defeat of the faithful-to-him  Durdynets [former Supreme Council deputy chairman], he is  running the risk of losing his hard-earned influence. The  conflict between the "ideologists" and the "economists" within  the nomenklatura has reached its apogee, which, on the other  hand, shows that the nomenklatura has definitely been  nationalized -- it also has two hetmans now. Plyushch has  undergone some unusual metamorphoses: While taking advantage of  his image of economic leader, Ivan Stepanovych does not forget  to react to political junctures in time, having temporarily  mutated into a federalist. His latest statements, including the  one in which he said that he is ready to personally head the  government in the event of his victory, show that Ivan  Stepanovych has bet everything on the presidential office, which  suggests that he has probably done his "homework" on the eve of  elections. Although Plyushch does not forget about his voters  (the majority of whom live in Galicia and rural areas), due to  the activeness of Oleksandr Moroz, his successor in parliament,  the main battle will take place on Leonid Kuchma's territory.  <H5>  Oleksandr Moroz </H5>   Every day, he increases his chances in the presidential  battle, and the main question is whether he will manage to win  enough popularity, during the short time remaining, to be  elected.    His election as Supreme Council speaker increased his  chances  in the battle for deputy seat. For people who are secretly  longing for "the good old times," he is attractive, because he  is promising to base his position on "creatively modified"  Marxism, and he does not repel all the others, since, after all,  he supports independence and speaks in Ukrainian.    Moroz has a pretty good chance to lure voters who have not  yet defined their positions, and who like the new speaker's  manners. Moroz has yet another advantage. Unlike all the other  candidates, he does not complain, but proposes. A whimpering  image is represented by another candidate:  <H5>  Leonid Kuchma </H5>   The former prime minister has significantly "marked down"  his  pro-Russian stance, and he is consistently trying to straddle  the line between "independence" and "healthy pragmatism," which  is not a very easy thing to do, since people want to obtain  unequivocal answers to unequivocal questions. Apparently,  Kuchma is the only one who is not working to alter his image,  stubbornly sticking to the line of sad economist, who was  rejected by "someone" wrong. Due to the campaign against  Kuchma, conducted by all of his foes, Kuchma may lose some of  his votes. As everybody knows, concerned over this campaign,  Kuchma has met with the Rukh leadership, and as one of the  participants in this meeting claims, he has even promised Rukh  certain key positions in the future government.    After the defeat of the Interregional Bloc of Reforms in the  elections and refusal to recognize the deputy powers of  Volodymyr Hrynyov, Leonid Kuchma is in need of new partners.  However, due to the peculiarities of his nature, Kuchma has a  gift to lose political allies without gaining new friends. For  many of his potential voters, he still remains a man who  "promised a lot, but did not do anything," and for those who  still try to think independently, the following man is much more  attractive:  <H5>  Volodymyr Lanovyy </H5>   No matter what the real reason behind Lanovyy's joining the  presidential race, one thing is obvious: In any case, Volodymyr  Tymofiyovych is winning popularity all over Ukraine, which can  become a starting block for quite another "jerk." Lanovyy's  main weakness is his youth, and the main weakness of his  presidential campaign is that his rivals are still emphasizing  his "academicism," forgetting about his experience in the sphere  of production.    Although the majority of Kiev residents will most likely  vote  for Lanovyy, he does not have many chances for victory, nor does  his rival Babych.  <H5>  Petro Talanchuk and Valeriy Babych </H5>   The education minister has the worst chances among all the  candidates. It is possible that his campaign will end by  withdrawing his candidacy in favor of someone stronger --  Kravchuk or Plyushch. Valeriy Babych, who is still trying to  continue an independent game, is in a better situation. Babych,  former Komsomol leader, is currently exploiting the image of  businessman descending from the people, who "became somebody"  only thanks to his determination and willpower. Babych's  propaganda is a mixture of Lanovyy's market proposals and  Kuchma's "pro-Russian attitude." Yet, Babych is not particularly  active in the electoral battle, properly believing that he  cannot count on victory too much. Apparently, after the defeat  of several "businessmen" in the parliamentary elections, more  and more businessmen begin to understand that money does not  resolve everything in politics.  <H5>  Chances and Prospects </H5>   The closer to 26 June, the more precise candidates'  political  positions. Kravchuk "is urging reforms" and threatening  political Philistines with "a leftist parliament." Plyushch has  become a federalist, and he wants to head the government.  Kuchma is dodging clear answers to questions concerning  relations with Russia, and he is demonstrating his discontent  with [Crimean President] Meshkov. Moroz is surprised when he  hears that "the leftists are against the market," and has  suspended his membership in the Socialist Party. The general  harmony has been joined by newspapers supporting their own  candidates. According to a survey of the press, conducted by  the "Rivnist Mozhlyvostey" [equality of opportunities] committee  between 23 and 29 May, newspapers published at the expense of  Ukrainian taxpayers have already clarified their positions:  HOLOS UKRAYINY devoted most of its space to candidate Kravchuk,  UKRAYINA MOLODA -- to candidate Moroz, ROBITNYCHA HAZETA -- to  candidate Kuchma.    Kravchuk, Plyushch, Moroz, and Kuchma have the best chances.  In a situation when the risk level is the same for all  candidates, Kravchuk and Kuchma have the greatest chances of  advancing to the second round, which means that Leonid Kravchuk  will be reelected.    The situation is being complicated by the fact that  Ukrainian  legislation does not define the ethical conduct of someone who  already holds an official post and repeatedly runs in the  elections. In other words, our society is not insured against  certain official's -- such as the speaker or president -- using  the entire arsenal at his disposal to influence, for instance,  the television or special services against his opponents. It  cannot be said, however, that this is currently taking place in  Ukraine, but this still means that one can manipulate our  society.</p>

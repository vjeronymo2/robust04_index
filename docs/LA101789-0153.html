			<p><P> October 17, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SOUTHLAND;  </P> <P> BEVERLY HILLS ATTENDANCE DROPS  </P> <P> Attendance plummeted at Beverly Hills schools today as a teachers' strike  against the elite district entered its second day with no sign of a settlement.  </P> <P> Students gathered for a brief morning rally outside Beverly Hills High School,  shouting "Scabs, go home!" and "We want our teachers!" One student held up a  sign that said "Students Can't Achieve With Bums." Beverly Hills police  officers were evident at the rally, but there were no incidents.  </P> <P> Beverly Hills Unified Supt. Robert L. French estimated that about 125 students  walked out of class, but students and other observers said the number was  closer to 200.  </P> <P> Only a small number of students appeared to return to class.  </P> <P> "Everyone is at Disneyland today," Doron Barness, 15, said. "I wanted to go,  but I decided to support my teachers instead."  </P> <P> Rady Rahban, 16, said his substitute teacher brought a VCR and television to  class and showed basketball "bloopers."  </P> <P> French said enrollment districtwide had dropped from 80% Monday to 53% this  morning. Attendance was lowest at Beverly Hills High -- 42% -- while attendance  at the district's four elementary schools was 62%, French said.  </P> <P> The district has a total of 4,700 students, with 2,029 at the high school.  </P></p>

			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Brussels pushes hard on telecoms The European Commission yesterday challenged member states to speed up the liberalisation of Europe's telecommunications industry. The Commission decided to adopt the first part of its green paper on infrastructures, which is aimed at opening those that are currently only authorised to carry specific services - for example rail and energy networks - to other liberalised services. This would cover video-on-demand and distance learning, for example, but not basic voice telephone services, which will not be liberalised until 1998. Mr Karel Van Miert, commissioner responsible for competition, said the Commission had also backed in principle the aim of liberalising basic telephone infrastructures - which remain largely under monopoly control - by January 1 1998, at the same time that voice services are opened up to competition. The Commission also intends to present member states with proposals, at a meeting of telecoms ministers next month, for liberalising cable television networks. The Commission's decision yesterday should allow the council of ministers to establish a clear timetable for liberalisation before the Essen summit in December.</p>

			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow subdued awaiting inflation news Wall Street US SHARE prices were stuck in a narrow range amid light trading yesterday as dealers and investors prepared for this week's important inflation data and the start of the quarterly reporting season, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 3.32 at 3,524.38. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 0.87 firmer at 448.98, while the American SE composite gained 3.73 at 438.10 and the Nasdaq composite put on 1.86 at 707.67. Trading volume on the New York SE was 203m shares, and rises outnumbered declines by 1,023 to 886. The week opened on a subdued note, with volume modest by recent standards and prices trapped close to opening values. The lack of activity was due primarily to caution ahead of this week's inflation figures. The June producer prices index is due to be released today, and the consumer prices index tomorrow, and although analysts have forecast good inflation news, investors were reluctant to trade in front of the figures. The start of the reporting season, which will get under way in earnest this week, also seemed to be keeping many on the sidelines. Ford, which has been well-bid in recent weeks, ran into heavy selling after a downgrade by broking house Salomon Brothers, and a cut in its earnings forecast. Salomon's analyst said he was concerned by the deterioration in the manufacturer's product mix, in particular its growing reliance on fleet sales. Ford dropped Dollars 2 to Dollars 50 1/8 in volume of 2.3m shares. Although the rest of the sector held up well on the news for much of the day, late selling eventually took its toll. General Motors lost Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 46 7/8 and Chrysler eased Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 47. Federal National Mortgage Association, the country's largest mortgage provider, fell Dollars 2 to Dollars 82 5/8 amid profit-taking after the company announced second-quarter earnings of Dollars 458.8m, the 22nd consecutive quarter of record profits. Merck dipped Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 34 1/2 in reaction to the announcement, released late last Friday, that Mr Richard Markham, the company's president and chief operating officer, had resigned. Aluminum Company of America (Alcoa) declined Dollars 1 to Dollars 70 1/2 after posting second-quarter earnings down 21 per cent, before special items, from a year earlier. Home Shopping Network rose Dollars 1 to Dollars 13 5/8 in volume of 3.8m shares after its main rival, QVC Network, proposed a merger between the two in a stock swap transaction. QVC, traded on the Nasdaq market, jumped Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 67 3/4 . Canada TORONTO'S gold and energy issues rebounded from last week's soft levels, leaving the TSE 300 index closing 23.1 ahead at 3,950.5 after a week of consolidation. But volume was moderate, falling to 45.7m shares from Friday's 60.2m. Precious metals shares were outstanding, the gold and silver index showing a gain of 2.1 per cent, while the oil and gas sector rose 1.0 per cent. Hyal Pharmaceutical, up 20 cents at CDollars 4.65, said studies show that its drug delivery system aids in delivering drugs to cancer tumours.</p>

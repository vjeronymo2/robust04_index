			<p><P> July 26, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAUSE FOR OPTIMISM  </P> <P> With two excellent if belated appointments by President Bush, the new national  AIDS Commission is complete and ready to get to work. There is optimism that it  will be an effective new force in facing the growing problem just at the moment  when the total of AIDS cases in the United States has reached 100,000.  </P> <P> The optimism has two sources. First of all, Bush has shown a concern and a  commitment that former President Ronald Reagan failed to provide. And,  secondly, the quality of the commission appointments is excellent, drawing  praise from some of the best-informed people engaged in the effort to contain  the pandemic, free of the extremism that characterized some of the members of  Reagan's Presidential Commission on the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)  Epidemic.  </P> <P> This new commission will have a running start on the problem because of the  excellent work done by the Reagan commission under the leadership of Adm. James  D. Watkins, now secretary of energy in the Bush Cabinet. Its report, published  just 13 months ago but largely ignored by the Reagan Administration, provides  an appropriate and urgent agenda for the new commission.  </P> <P> A score of major recommendations and hundreds of detailed proposals emerged  from the work of that commission. The report recognized the importance of  prevention in the absence of a cure, the importance of early treatment of those  with the HIV infection long before they have symptoms of AIDS and AIDS-related  illnesses, and the importance of anti-discrimination legislation to protect the  victims of the disease. It identified areas of reform needed in testing and  speeding the availability of new drugs, and also the need for more research.  Developments in the succeeding months have confirmed the wisdom of its  findings.  </P> <P> President Bush has named two members to the new commission: Belinda Ann Mason,  a young mother of two who herself was infected with HIV through a blood  transfusion, and Dr. David E. Rogers, professor of medicine at Cornell  University Medical College in New York City and former president of the Robert  Wood Johnson Foundation, which has been the most generous private source of  funding for AIDS research and health care programs. Three cabinet members also  will serve: Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, secretary of health and human services; Dick  Cheney, secretary of defense, and Edward J. Derwinski, secretary of veteran  affairs. The other members are Eunice Diaz, a health consultant and member of  the Los Angeles County AIDS Commission; Rep. Roy Rowland (D-Ga.), a physician;  Larry Kessler, executive director of the Boston AIDS Action Committee; Diane  Ahrens, head of the Ramsey County, Minn., board of commissioners; Rev. Scott  Allen, coordinator of the AIDS Interfaith Network in Dallas; Dr. Don C. Des  Jarlais, an AIDS research coordinator in New York; Donald S. Goldman of  Livingston, N.J., an attorney; Dr. June Osborn, dean of the University of  Michigan school of public health; Harry Dalton, a Yale law professor, and Dr.  Charles Konigsberg, director of health for the Kansas Health and Environment  Department.  </P></p>

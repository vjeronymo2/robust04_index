Our correspondent  Yelena Kuznetsova reports.    [Kuznetsova] At the start of the news conference, Vladimir  Shumeyko analyzed the difficult situation that developed on the  second day of parliament, when they were just one vote short of  electing him chairman, and the way this situation changed by the  third of work of the chamber.    [Begin Shumeyko recording] I would say this was a normal  thing in a situation in which the chamber did not want  confrontation of any kind among political groupings or factions.  Nevertheless, there were people who hold pretty much polarized  views over what is happening in the state right now. On the one  hand you have the prevailing concept that we have to get  parliament all working together. But many people think that in  order to achieve this it is necessary to elect a leader who  shares their political views. And gradually yesterday's voting  showed this; it was natural that in the first instance  everything should move apart.    Subsequently, an analysis of the situation overnight showed  that if they continued in that direction no single group would  gain more votes and the split would continue. This would  eventually lead to mutual insults and so on.    The situation today showed that in fact common sense  prevailed. [end recording]    [Kuznetsova] In response to a question about what should be  avoided in the chamber's work, the Federation Council chairman  said he will try to avoid behind-the-scenes intrigues and he  hopes that there will be no factional activity in parliament.    Asked about possible cooperation with Vladimir Zhirinovskiy  should the latter be elected speaker of the State Duma, Vladimir  Shumeyko said quite unambiguously that he is obliged to  cooperate since the law exists, regardless of one's attitude to  one's partner.    Speaking of the Federation Council's obligation to ratify  major international agreements, Vladimir Shumeyko said:    [Begin Shumeyko recording] If we are to speak about  treaties, then we really are faced with complicated tasks. And  here I would express solidarity first of all with the statement  made by Foreign Minister Kozyrev, who said quite clearly that  the West should stop moralizing and preaching at Russia. Russia  is not a state that needs to be told what to do and so on. That  is one thing. Another thing is that one of Russia's main  priorities should be concern for the interests of what is  referred to today as the Russian-speaking population. [end  recording]    [Kuznetsova] Replying to a question about the appearance of  a tough Communist opposition within the Federation Council,  Vladimir Shumeyko named 12 people from various communist parties  and noted the existence of quite a large group who share this  ideology. Much will depend on which deputies are elected by the  chamber. It is precisely this question that will be the main  focus of the Federation Council's work on 14 January.</p>

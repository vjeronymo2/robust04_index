			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Co-operative Bank raises provisions BAD DEBT provisions at Co-operative Bank rose by 11 per cent during the 26 weeks to mid-July, compared to the same period last year, writes David Barchard. However the bank which lost Pounds 6m in 1991 showed signs of a recovery this year. Though its loan book contracted, reflecting reduced demand in the market and tougher credit conditions, retail deposits were said to have grown steadily in the half year, leaving the bank highly liquid. Pre-tax profits were Pounds 3.5m, up from Pounds 700,000, after a 12 per cent rise in opera- ting profits during the half year. The bank, which is mutually owned, paid out Pounds 2.8m in dividends on its preference shares.</p>

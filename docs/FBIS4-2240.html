			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Zhang Yijun (1728 4135 0193)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 8 Apr (XINHUA) -- In talks held at the  Diaoyutai State Guesthouse this morning with Qaddumi, foreign  minister of the State of Palestine and chairman of the Political  Department of the PLO, Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Qian  Qichen reiterated that China hopes that all sides involved will  continue to adopt a flexible and pragmatic stand in order to  bring about all- round progress in the Middle East peace process.    Qian Qichen said: Disputes among countries can only be  resolved through peace negotiations. The signing of the  Palestinian-Israeli Agreement on Autonomy shows that the  Palestinian issue can finally be resolved through peace  negotiations.    He said: The Middle East issue is a regional conflict which  has continued since World War II, and the road to peace is still  long and tortuous. The Hebron massacre in February this year  has demonstrated even more the urgency of resolving the  Palestinian issue.    Qian Qichen said: China resolutely supports the peace  process in the Middle East and, as always, supports the just  cause of the Palestinian people.    Qaddumi thoroughly briefed Qian Qichen on the negotiations  between Palestine and Israel and between other Arab countries  and Israel and on the situation in the occupied territories.    Qaddumi stressed: The safety of Palestinians in the occupied  territories should be effectively guaranteed in accordance with  the consistent resolution of the United Nations. The PLO will  continue to make unremitting efforts for a political solution to  the Palestinian issue.    He said: Israel should withdraw its troops from the occupied  territories as soon as possible, thereby ensuring the early  implementation of the Palestinian-Israeli Agreement.    Qaddumi thanked the Chinese Government and people for their  consistent support for the just cause of the Palestinian people.    After the talks, Qian Qichen and Qaddumi signed a Sino-  Palestinian agreement on economic and technological cooperation.  According to this agreement, the Chinese Government will grant  the State of Palestine a 75 million yuan interest-free loan.  Since the Palestinian-Israeli Agreement was signed in September  last year, to support Palestine's reconstruction China has  provided Palestine with a 30 million yuan interest-free loan,  built a school for the state free of charge, and presented 410  tonnes of rice and 240 tonnes of sugar in gratuitous aid.    This morning, the two foreign ministers also signed and  exchanged notes on $500,000 in cash given to Palestine by China  to support its reconstruction.</p>

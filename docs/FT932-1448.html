			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Survey of Spain, Banking and Finance (14): Last economic castle collapses - The Peseta LOOKING back, it is hard to even conceive of how the Spanish government  - on deciding to take the peseta into the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System just before hosting the country's first European Community summit in June 1989 - decided to make Pta65 worth DM1. Was it arrogance? Was the government simply trying to make voters believe the country really had arrived at the European pinnacle? Or did Madrid really think its currency was worth that much money? There have been lots of theories, most of them emanating from the Finance Ministry, about why a strong peseta was necessary. First, it was a weapon in the fight against inflation - by making imports cheap during a time of rising consumer spending, you were importing low, German, inflation and at the same time forcing local industry to re-tool and become competitive. As high real interest rates quickly drove the currency close to Pta62 for DM1, government officials would happily suggest that their problem was not that the currency was growing too strong but that it still might not be strong enough. Then, when inflation did not fall, but rose, the strong peseta became necessary simply because it was vital to have a stable currency. There never seemed to be much debate about what level it ought to be stable at. The peseta was the last of the economic castles created during 11 years of unchallengeable rule by Mr Felipe Gonzalez, prime minister, to collapse. In three devaluations in nine months - the last on May 13, in the middle of a general election campaign - it crumbled to Pta79.1 to DM1 and many foreign exchange market analysts expect it to fall further as the economy weakens. An economy which in 1989 created 1,000 jobs a day was destroying nearly 3,000 a day in January, February and March this year. Inflation, considered to be doing well at an annual 4.6 per cent, is in fact no better than what it was at the end of 1987. In between, inflated company profits fuelled high wage rises and took inflation up to nearly 7 per cent. No-one bothered to warn employers or unions. Mr Gonzalez won his third general election in 1989 because Spaniards were still enjoying themselves and the post-fiesta rot had not yet set in. After the devaluations and the creeping collapse of the peseta against the D-Mark earlier last summer, however, Spaniards are now more than 20 per cent poorer - in European terms - than they were a year ago. Mr Gonzalez' boast that Spaniards were earning nearly 80 per cent of average EC income has also been badly set back. He never mentioned it in his recent campaign. But with the socialist victory on June 6 - albeit without a parliamentary majority - the peseta has firmed a little, to about Pta76 to DM1. This is mainly because the socialists are less likely than their conservative opponents, the Peoples Party (PP), to cut interest rates rapidly and analysts agree there is some room for a fall to below the current Pta79.1 parity against the German currency. Much will depend on how quickly Mr Gonzalez is able to put in place a stable administration, committed to fiscal discipline and strong enough to push labour market reform past certain union opposition. Government-building has already begun and should soon be complete. For the moment, the Bank of Spain is using the peseta's relative strength to build its reserves up should the speculators return. Foreign exchange reserves are part of a tiny mystery in Spain at the moment. The Bank is believed to have tried to stave off the last devaluation by selling pesetas forward and thus its real reserves may be lower than the official count of about Dollars 44bn. The Bank has vigorously denied that it tried to stave off the last devaluation by selling peseta options, but the accusation and the denial were very tightly focused on options and the true state of the reserves has not been settled by either. One way to find out would be for the markets to test the peseta again although the Bank (supported by the government), despite its nominal interest rate cuts, is holding real rates high in order to capture foreign savings necessary to finance the country's public deficits. Some things do not change. If the country sinks any deeper into recession, those real rates will become untenable and Mr Gonzalez must hope that, as he readjusts his economic sights downwards a little, he is given time to prepare his defences.</p>

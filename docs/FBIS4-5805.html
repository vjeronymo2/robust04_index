			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 14 KYODO -- Parliamentary vice  ministers on Thursday [14 April] urged the rapid formation of a  new government, under the current coalition framework, to tackle  a host of pressing political tasks, a government spokesman said.    They unanimously adopted, at their regular meeting, a  resolution calling for the early installation of a new  administration, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Hatoyama  told a news conference.    The accord also calls for early Diet approval of the already  overdue budget for fiscal 1994, which began April 1, Hatoyama  said.    Parliamentary Vice Construction Minister Eisei Ito proposed  that an agreement should be reached to end the political turmoil  which has resulted from Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's  sudden decision to resign last Friday, he explained.    Hatoyama spoke of the need for the ruling parties to  synchronize their basic policies, particularly on some issues of  immediate concern, as a prerequisite for the formation of a new  coalition government.    "Without such a policy consensus, the new government will  face a crisis sooner or later," he said.</p>

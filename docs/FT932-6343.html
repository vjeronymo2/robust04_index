			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / International Company News: R H Macy revises cuts R. H. Macy, the bankrupt New York-based department store group, plans additional cost-cutting measures as part of a revised, five-year business plan. It said yesterday it had toned down its projections for growth in sales and gross margins because of 'continuing sluggishness in the economy and competitive pressures'. It released details of its first business plan in November, when some retailers were optimistic about the sector. Macy said it would cut jobs by about 11 per cent more than anticipated in the original plan, and was attempting to reduce spending on advertising to focus on 'target' customers. It also envisages a new health care programme, which should save more than Dollars 37m in fiscal 1994 and Dollars 57m in 1995.</p>

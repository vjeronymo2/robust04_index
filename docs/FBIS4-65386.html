			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Anguita Demands That Gonzalez </F> Undergo Confidence Vote or Resign"]    [Text] Madrid -- [United Left (IU) Coordinator General]  Julio Anguita stated yesterday, during the debate on the  situation created by [former Civil Guard Director General] Luis  Roldan's escape, that the solutions to the political crisis are  for the People's Party to submit a censure motion, or for Felipe  Gonzalez to resign or undergo a confidence vote, in which the  nationalists would express their support for the government.  "If there is no resignation by the prime minister, if there is  no confidence vote, and if no censure motion is submitted," the  IU coordinator general said, "let the Spanish people pass  sentence 12 June and say who should carry it out."    In a tough but calm tone, for which Felipe Gonzalez gave  thanks, following the tension of the debate with Aznar, the IU  leader reiterated the reasons for demanding Gonzalez'  resignation, "and in this order": unemployment, the destruction  of the industrial fabric, an antisocial policy unparalleled  throughout Europe, because he is the person responsible for the  advance of not only the social but also the ideological right,  and because he has encouraged an economic policy that  facilitates corruption.    Anguita devoted part of his speech to explaining the need  for  Deputy Prime Minister Narcis Serra to appear before the Roldan  committee, as being jointly responsible for the former Civil  Guard director general's appointment, and to demanding that he,  too, accept his responsibility by tendering his resignation.    Responding to Aznar's assertions that he cannot submit a  censure motion because he does not have any political group's  support, Anguita asserted that if the IU had a sufficient number  of deputies to use this procedure, it would do so, as Felipe  Gonzalez did when Suarez was prime minister, "while knowing that  we would lose it, because it is no use making empty threats."  He therefore regretted that the People's Party "did not submit  a censure motion in order to listen to another government  program."    He reiterated the demand for Gonzalez' resignation "for the  sake of stability," "because I do not understand the Caesarism  of the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party], which bases  political stability on one person," and he asserted that if  Gonzalez were replaced by another Socialist, the IU "would  listen to the program and go all out for him if he changed  policy."    Anguita demanded that Gonzalez undergo a confidence vote so  that "the nationalists will say in parliament what you say they  told you over the telephone, and thus we will know who is who."  If none of this happens, he believes that an election will have  to be called, since what is not possible is for everything to  continue as hitherto, with the series of resignations, Luis  Roldan's escape, and the jailing of [former Bank of Spain  Governor] Mariano Rubio, since, he stated, if all this has  happened without anybody's being aware, "the whole ministerial  bench would have to go, but not because of joint responsibility  but because of ineptitude."</p>

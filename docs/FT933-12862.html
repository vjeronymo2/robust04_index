			<p>930722 FT  22 JUL 93 / Travel brochure waste criticised THE TRAVEL industry throws away about 40 per cent of the 120m holiday brochures printed each year, with many packages dumped unopened in bins and skips, a report published yesterday says. The report by Green Flag International, an environmental group set up in 1990 with support from tour operators, says the total annual cost of printing holiday brochures is Pounds 86.5m - Pounds 20 for each booking. Brochure printing accounts for more than 1m trees each year. Only 10 per cent of UK tour operators use recycled paper or soluble inks, the report says. A similar proportion operate a system enabling agents to return unused brochures. Only 25 per cent sought environmental guidance on brochure production. Tour operators said recycled paper was unsuitable for brochures because it was not strong or white enough and soluble inks were not of sufficiently high quality. Nearly two-thirds of the 30 travel agents questioned said they disposed of unwanted brochures in council bins or skips. Only 17 per cent used a recycling company. Tour operators and travel agents said the best way to reduce waste would be to improve brochure distribution. Travel agents said tour operators could assist by delivering brochures only when ordered and by packing them in smaller quantities. The large tour operators said they intended to target their brochures more carefully, sending the largest number to the best-performing travel agents. Currently, the typical large operator works with between 4,000 and 4,500 travel agents. A Review of the Environmental Impact of the Travel Brochure Industry.

			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Survey of Computer Networking (9): EDS wins big Xerox contract - Dollars 3.2bn landmark 'outsourcing' deal Xerox Corporation has awarded a 10-year, Dollars 3.2bn contract to Electronic Data Systems (EDS), the computer services company owned by General Motors, to operate the Xerox worldwide computer and telecoms network, writes Michael Wiltshire. The 'outsourcing' contract is believed to be the largest of its kind, and the first to encompass the worldwide information management operations of any company. Under the arrangement, EDS will assume responsibility for Xerox data-processing, telecoms and computer network services in 19 countries, and provide and maintain the computer applications that support Xerox's internal business processes. EDS will control data centre operations, including the main ones in the US, the UK and Brazil; worldwide voice and data communications; desktop systems support; and business-support applications. Xerox will retain responsibility for determining the architecture of its computer systems, strategy and program development. It will also continue to service and support its customers. In all, 1,700 Xerox staff, including 1,400 in the US and 750 in the UK, will transfer to EDS over the next 18 months. Xerox has taken the unprecedented step of outsourcing almost all its information management operations to 'focus resources on our core business of document processing, which is critical to ensure our continued success in a fiercely competitive industry,' says Mr Paul Allaire, Xerox chairman. The outsourcing arrangement will cut costs, he adds - 'this is the first truly global commercial information management outsourcing arrangement and provides an opportunity for EDS to showcase its proven abilitities.' EDS has operations in more than 30 countries and employes around 70,000 people. Xerox awarded the contract to EDS following a six-month study of its information management organisation. Patricia Wallington, chief information officer at Xerox, says the cost-saving deal 'will allow us to focus on improving the delivery of computer and telecoms services that support Xerox people; and free Xerox management to pursue a strategic course to design and integrate new technologies.'</p>

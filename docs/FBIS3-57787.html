			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Oberndorf (DDP/ADN) -- The Baden-Wuerttemberg arms  factory Heckler und Koch denied a report in the London daily  INDEPENDENT that the firm allegedly supplied rifles to Serbia in  1992 despite the UN arms embargo. Company spokeswoman Andrea  Franke stated today in Oberndorf that Heckler und Koch only  exported hunting rifles to former Yugoslavia with the necessary  approval in the early 1980's. This would not come under the  arms embargo, she said.    According to the London paper, the Serbian authorities have  confirmed that the arms factory supplied G3 weapons to Belgrade.  The spokeswoman stressed that the company could not understand  how these weapons, which come under the embargo, had come to be  in former Yugoslavia. The newspaper's information is "untrue."  Heckler und Kohl had "at no time" supplied arms to the war zone.    The British arms manufacturer Royal Ordnance, which has  belonged to British Aerospace since 1987, bought the  Baden-Wuerttemberg factory in 1991. According to the paper,  there were extensive contacts between the two firms before this  time, however. The paper said that the British arms company  acted as a kind of "mediator" and helped to export arms to the  former GDR. The weapons were first transported from Oberndorf  to London and from there shipped to Rostock. Heckler und Koch  weapons have also been found in Nicaragua. Heckler and Koch  were able to circumvent German export laws through the contacts  with Royal Ordnance, the INDEPENDENT said.</p>

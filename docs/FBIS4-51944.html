			<p>BFN     [Text] Amid growing attention to the possible dissolution  of the House of Representatives and a general election following  passage of the 1994 fiscal budget bill, Wataru Kubo, general  secretary of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], and  Masayoshi Takemura, the leader of Sakigake [Harbinger], held  respective news conferences on 2 May. In separate news  conferences, the two indicated their stand that the next House  of Representatives general elections should not adhere to the  new electoral system--an electoral system combining single-seat  and proportional representation constituencies. Prime Minister  Tsutomu Hata is eager to submit to the Diet a bill for electoral  districts as soon as possible, and hopes to hold general  elections under the new electoral system. But if the SDPJ and  Sakigake, which advocated elections under the new electoral  system when they were members of Hosokawa's coalition  government, should support a dissolution of the Diet and  elections under the current electoral system, the move towards  holding a general election under the current multiple  constituency system will gain further momentum because there is  a similar move within the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP].    Speaking at the news conference in Kagoshima, SDPJ General  Secretary Kubo said: "We passed political reform bills, so we  have a responsibility to carry out political reform. Holding an  election under the current electoral system is imprudent."  However, he added: "If public opinion requires it, or if  parliamentary democracy is damaged, then it may be necessary to  dissolve the parliament and hold general elections under the  current multiple-seat constituency system." In this way, he  indicated there is a possibility the lower house will be  dissolved and general elections will be held under the current  electoral system depending on the situation.    Kubo then expressed dissatisfaction with the fact that a  study is underway by the Hata cabinet seeking ways to recognize  the right to collective defense and to establish emergency  defense legislation. He added that the government's actions  dealing with security issues, former Prime Minister Hosokawa's  100 million yen loan, and tax reform are the key to the future  political situation. He pointed out that a general election may  be held if one of the above issues creates a controversy and  instigates a political crisis.    Sakigake leader Masayoshi Takemura held his news conference  at the Shiga Prefectural Office in Otsu, indicating his  prospects for a general election. He stated: "I hope the  redistricting plan will be drafted at an early date, and that  the next election will be held under the new electoral system."  He added: "I will not stick to the new electoral system if the  situation requires an election under the current electoral  system to ensure the stabilization of politics." Underlying  this remark is his view that if a no-confidence motion is  submitted against the cabinet by the LDP following passage of  the 1994 budget bill, then the dissolution of the Diet and  general elections under the current electoral system are  unavoidable.    On 15 April, when it decided to leave the coalition yet  support the cabinet from outside, Sakigake announced "it will  make efforts to swiftly pass the bills submitted by the Hosokawa  cabinet, including the political reform bills." Before the 2  May news conference, Takemura said "there is a strong  possibility the lower house will be dissolved within this year"  and general elections will be held under the new electoral  system.</p>

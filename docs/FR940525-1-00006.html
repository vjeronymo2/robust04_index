			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Provisions of the Proposed Regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Due Dates for Filing Cost Report  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposed rule would increase the amount of time a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provider has to file its cost report. Presently, under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;413.24(f)(2)(i), a provider must file its cost report on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or before the last day of the third month following the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> close of the period covered by the report. Under this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule, the provider would be required to file an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acceptable cost report, as defined at new &sect;413.24(f)(5), on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or before the last day of the fifth month following the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> close of the period covered by the report (that is, if a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provider's cost reporting period ends June 30, 1994, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provider would have from July 1, 1994 through November 30,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1994 to file its cost report.) For cost reporting periods  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ending on a day other than the last day of a month, cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reports would be due 150 days after the last day of the cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reporting period. (In accordance with &sect;405.376(e)(3),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interest would not begin to accrue until the day following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the due date of the report.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In proposing this change, we are responding to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> objections from providers to the current 3-month time frame,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which many providers believe creates an undue burden on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their financial departments. For example, in a recent cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> report extension survey report, many providers cited  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> problems in getting accurate PS&amp;R data as a primary reason  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for requesting an extension. Under this proposed rule, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional time providers would have to submit their cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reports also would allow the intermediaries additional time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to prepare the necessary PS&amp;R reports. With the additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time, we believe that the intermediaries would be able to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide more accurate and complete PS&amp;R data to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> providers, which would, in turn, result in providers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requiring less time to reconcile the PS&amp;R data with their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> records. The providers also would have additional time to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prepare their books and records, complete the necessary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> audits and develop financial statements and reports that are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> needed before providers can complete the cost reporting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> forms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We are also proposing to change the regulations at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;413.24(f)(2)(ii) that allow an intermediary to grant, for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> good cause, a 30-day extension of the due date after first  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obtaining the approval of HCFA. Since we believe that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time frame we are proposing for the filing of the cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> report (5 months) is sufficient, we propose that extensions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may be granted by the intermediary only when a provider's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operations are significantly adversely affected due to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extraordinary circumstances over which the provider has no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control. An example of such extraordinary circumstances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> might be a flood or a fire that forced a provider to cease  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operations and transfer its patients temporarily to other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> providers outside of the impacted area. The intermediary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would still be required to obtain HCFA approval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We are also proposing to delete &sect;413.24(f)(2)(iii),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which now states that the cost report from a provider that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> voluntarily or involuntarily ceases to participate in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicare program or experiences a change of ownership is due  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> no later than 45 days following the effective date of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> termination of the provider agreement or change of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ownership. We do not believe the current 45-day period is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sufficient time for these providers to file a final cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> report. Instead, as a result of the proposed deletion of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;413.24(f)(2)(iii), providers in these cirumstances would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be permitted the same amount of time to file a cost report  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as other providers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Acceptable Cost Report Submissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We are also proposing to define at &sect;413.24(f)(5) what  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HCFA considers to be an acceptable cost report submission.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Provisions of the proposed definition are as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;All providers: The provider must complete and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submit the required cost reporting forms, including all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary signatures, and also must submit all supporting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> documentation required by the intermediary (for example, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> working trial balance; HCFA Form 339, Provider Cost Report  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reimbursement Questionnaire; and copies of audited financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statements).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Providers that are required to file electronic cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reports: In addition to completing and submitting the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required cost reporting forms and supporting documentation,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the provider also must submit its cost reports in an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> electronic cost report format in conformance with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements contained in section 130 of the Electronic Cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Report (ECR) Specifications Manual (unless the hospital has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received an exemption from HCFA.) These requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include the electronic file passing all of the fatal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (level 1) edits contained in the ECR Specifications Manual.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An acceptable cost report submission also must include all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the appropriate signatures. (Additional instructions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerning electronic submission of cost reports can be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> found at &sect;413.24(f)(4), as set forth in our final rule with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment period published elsewhere in this issue of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, we would specify that the intermediary is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to make a determination of acceptability within 30 days of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receipt of the cost report. If the intermediary considers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the cost report unacceptable, the intermediary returns it to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the provider with a letter explaining the reasons for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rejection (for example, the cost report failed a fatal edit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or included incomplete documentation). When the cost report  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is rejected, it is deemed an unacceptable submission and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treated as if a report had never been filed. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intermediary would also inform the provider of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consequences of filing a late cost report, that is, interest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be assessed on all overpayments and the provider's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interim payments would be suspended. Given the additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> filing time, we believe providers should have sufficient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time to complete and submit an acceptable cost report.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, we are suspending all payments if the cost report is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not filed within the 5-month timeframe. The provider should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> make the necessary corrections to the cost report and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resubmit the cost report to the intermediary as quickly as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

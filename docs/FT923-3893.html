			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Brazilian privatisations 'still on schedule' despite political crisis BRAZIL'S head of privatisation said this week that the denationalising of state industries was on schedule, despite the political crisis around President Fernando Collor. Mr Eduardo Modiano, president of the national development bank, BNDES, said in an interview that the programme was not being accelerated, or slowed by the crisis. By end-November, auctions for three more government fertiliser companies were due. Meanwhile, in early October, evaluations should be received for the remaining state-controlled steel companies, most of the petrochemicals sector and the aerospace company, Embraer. Auctions for these were due before the end of next March, although agreement by banks and debenture holders of Embraer had to be secured for a recapitalisation. Mr Modiano declined to be drawn on prospects for privatisation if the president leaves office. Vice-President Itamar Franco is thought less sympathetic to rapid privatisation. The BNDES chief said he believed that, so far, the crisis had not affected prices paid for the 15 companies privatised so far - Dollars 3.4bn, most of it in various forms of government debt - but conceded conditions were far from ideal to maximise prices. 'We have no foreign capital coming in, slow economic activity, inflation of 20 per cent a month and nobody has any cruzeiros because of tight monetary policy,' he said. 'If any of these conditions had been different, prices would be different, but that doesn't mean we should wait.' Delays would mean the government would be incurring growing losses. He defended the decision to accept debt from state entities, much of which is not being serviced, as payment for privatised companies. He argued that, if payment in the government's short-term debt were accepted, this would reduce pressure on Congress to pass essential fiscal reform. BNDES has proposed changes which would mean that 10 per cent of the payment for privatised companies would be in cash, to be directed to a social fund. That move, however, would require Congressional approval, Congress having stipulated that proceeds from privatisation must be used to pay off debt. The use of domestic debt has been highly controvesial. Brazilian newspapers yesterday said businessmen who met Mr Franco on Tuesday had reported the vice-president saying he favoured privatisations only for cash.</p>

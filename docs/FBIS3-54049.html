			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres in </F> Oslo by Karmit Gay -- live]    [Text] [Gay] We are told about progress but no  breakthrough in the talks with the Palestinians. Is that  correct?    [Peres] We are making progress all the time, the  breakthrough in principle has already been made, now we have to  make further progress.    [Gay] As we heard, you went into the details yesterday, so  let us also go into them. For instance, the deployment of  Palestinian policemen at the crossing points. Is it true that  the PLO has agreed to yield on that?    [Peres] I do not want to go into details. We are  negotiating and I think we are quite close to an agreement, but  I prefer not to go into details at this stage.    [Gay] How close is quite close?    [Peres] If we receive reasonable answers from the other  side, I think we will overcome the differences. In other words,  things they said no to before, they are now reconsidering. We  will give them time to review things and then see.    [Gay] If you do not want to go into details, then let us  talk about the principle that previously they said no, and now  they are saying perhaps, and tomorrow they might say no again,  as has happened in the past.    [Peres] What has been signed is finalized, and we are now  aspiring to sign a paper, which we will bring home, and on which  we will consult with the prime minister. I do not think it pays  to make haste in making statements instead of waiting a few more  days and presenting things in a precise way. New ideas were  raised and a breakthrough is in the offing, but until it is  signed and entered in the protocols, a shadow hangs over the  agreement itself.    [Gay] We heard that Foreign Ministry legal adviser Yo'el  Singer will confer with Abu-'Ala' [Ahmad Quray'] next week and  that they will finalize everything in writing. Is that meant to  prevent a situation in which one side can claim the following  day that it was misinterpreted?    [Peres] Definitely. We want a paper signed by both sides.  There is a genuine difficulty I do not want to dismiss. Except  for the fact that both sides have internal problems, the real  hardship is that it is an unprecedented agreement, it has  nothing to base itself on and nobody to learn from. Therefore,  any problem we come up against is not only a new problem but  also sets a precedent. That is why we have to invest a great  deal of what the Americans call creative effort to overcome the  difficulties. I think we have succeeded in overcoming some of  them.    [Gay] What about the Syrian track, can you tell us about any  progress or an improved atmosphere on that track prior to  tomorrow's Washington talks?    [Peres] No, not yet, but we will receive tomorrow initial  indications in which direction things are moving. What is clear  is that the United States is very, very interested in reaching  an agreement, a comprehensive agreement, although for us a  comprehensive agreement means with all the Arab states.    [Gay] Yes, but we are not signing the agreement with the  United States, we are signing it with Syria, Jordan, and the  Palestinians.    [Peres] Absolutely, that is why we are negotiating with  them. I am simply saying that the United States is very  interested and is offering its good offices in order to reach  that, although it is very careful not to appear to be a  participant. In other words, it does not raise its own  proposals and is more of a facilitator to permit the sides to  make progress.    [Gay] In reference to the international fund you helped set  up yesterday. What can you tell us about that?    [Peres] The issue is that the Palestinians do not have the  seed money to set up an administration or a police force.  Foreign states do not tend to hand out funds to such an entity  or organization because they all have to answer to their  parliaments. What I suggested is a structure that permits the  Palestinians to receive seed money and start implementing their  plan, their actions. I suggested that a group made up of four  trustees, a sort of mutual fund, be set up headed by a UN  representative and have an American, a Norwegian, and a Japanese  member. Later, I spoke with all those involved. The Japanese  will probably donate $7.5 million, the Norwegians will give $7.5  million, and the United States will donate $10 million. There  will be a total of $25 million and the trustees will be the ones  to decide on what to spend the money so that it will not be  wasted on personal or political matters. That was done  relatively quickly and it solved a complex problem at the  initial stage. I suggested that it be called the Holst Fund,  which was accepted.    [Gay] To conclude, can we hear your impression of Yasir  'Arafat, whom you met yesterday. You were recently heard  expressing hesitation and doubts about his ability to come up  with the goods or his desire to do so. What was your impression  yesterday?    [Peres] I got the impression that like you said, he wants to  provide the goods, in other words, to complete the agreement.  In our talks, he was very businesslike and what is called low  key [last two words in English]. The deliberations were  definitely based on logic and not emotions.</p>

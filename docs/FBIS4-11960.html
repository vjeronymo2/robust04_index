			<p>BFN     [Text] The Syrian Army handed over 11 Hizballah fighters  to the Lebanese Army last night. They had been arrested about  three weeks ago in the course of a violent demonstration to mark  Jerusalem Day held in Ba'labakk, an area under Syrian control in  Lebanon.    Uri Lubrani, coordinator of government activities in  Lebanon,  told our correspondent Yoram Kohen that as far as is known this  is the first time such an event has occurred. If it is true,  Lubrani added, this is a step in the right direction aimed at  curbing terror in Lebanon.</p>

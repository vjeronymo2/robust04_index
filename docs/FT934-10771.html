			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Yeltsin lays down the law to regional leaders PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin yesterday told leaders of Russia's 88 regions and republics to approve a new constitution stripping them of privileges and rights and asserting the power of the presidency and the federal government. In a toughly worded speech to the regional leaders, the Russian president insisted on removing from the draft constitution all reference to the republics as 'sovereign states' and to a right of secession - clauses which had been part of earlier drafts before Mr Yeltsin's hand was strengthened by his military victory over the Russian parliament a month ago. He also said the 67 regions and the 21 republics must enjoy the same rights and responsibilities - rather than, as now, a bias in favour of republics. A group of regions, including Tatarstan, Yakutia, Bashkiria, Kabardino Balkaria and Dagestan, have objected to these clauses and demanded changes. Mr Mintimer Shamiyev, president of Tatarstan, said that 'this is the constitution of a unitary state. People in the republics will not support such a draft.' However, after a day's argument, Mr Yeltsin ordered a six-man commission to thrash out an agreed position - while making it clear through Mr Sergei Filatov, his chief of staff, that he would not fundamentally alter the disputed clauses and that if no agreement was reached he would push it through in its present form. The draft constitution must be completed and published by November 10, a statutory month before elections which will also include a referendum on the constitution.</p>

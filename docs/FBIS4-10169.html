			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on economic activities monitored through 7 April.    Export earnings derived from the marketing of 120,359 tonnes  of meat, sausages, offal, and by-products totalled $218.3  million in 1993. Even though the volume exported was down 13.7  percent compared with the previous year, the price per tonne was  up by 1.9 percent totaling $1,814. Beef exports, which account  for 10.2 percent of Uruguay's exports, totaled $156.2 million,  thus registering a 14.1 percent decline. The leading importers  of Uruguayan beef are the UK, Chile, Germany, Israel, Brazil,  and Japan, which purchase 62.7 percent of total meat exports.  (Montevideo EL PAIS in Spanish 22 Mar 94 Market Indicators  Section p 1)    A study done by the Planning and Budget Office and funded by  the United Nations Development Program reveals that the level of  poverty in Uruguay has considerably declined over the last eight  years. It fell 40 percent in Montevideo from 1984-92, and 20  percent in the cities of the interior. The study notes that  Uruguay has the lowest level of poverty in Latin America.  (Montevideo BUSQUEDA in Spanish 24 Mar 94 p 31)    The government registered a surplus totaling 85.8 million  pesos, some $19.2 million, in January, thus reversing the  negative results of the previous eight months. Despite this  positive figure, the fiscal situation continues to show signs of  deterioration due to the continued increase in government  spending, which was up 25 percent in January compared with the  same month in 1993, and the decrease in tax revenues, which  declined 7 percent in the same month. Public investment in  January surged 36.5 percent. (Montevideo EL PAIS in Spanish 29  Mar 94 Market Indicators Section p 1)    Wholesale prices rose 3 percent in March, thus registering a  32 percent increase over the last 12 months and an accrued  increase of 7.1 percent in the first quarter of this year.  Agricultural products were up by nearly 10 percent; livestock  products by 4.0 percent; fishing products by 0.5 percent; and  manufactured goods by 2.1 percent.

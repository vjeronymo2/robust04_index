			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Aleksandr Garyevich Nuzhnikov, deputy </F> chairman of the Federal Service on Currency and Export Control,  by Igor Ostrovskiy; place and date not given: "Currency Is  Accumulating Beyond the Cordon; a Federal Service Was  Established in Russia To Prevent the Plundering of the Country"]    [Text] Western experts think that Russia is  shortchanged $12-$13 billion annually for commodities sold  abroad. Therefore, specialists of the IMF and the International  Bank do not always believe our leaders who give assurances that  Russia is not in a position to either pay debts or do without  outside assistance in the structural restructuring of industry.  How is the money flowing abroad to be returned? The answer to  this question is supposed to be given by the Federal Service on  Currency and Export Control. Aleksandr Garyevich Nuzhnikov, the  first deputy director of the service, talks about this.    "It must distress you as well, and many others. It will  hardly be possible to return the dollars that have already  accumulated in foreign banks to improve our economy. There are  no domestic mechanisms or international agreements for this. We  will have to build a normative-legal basis that henceforth will  not allow even one Russian kopek to accumulate anywhere whatever  except in the state treasury."    [Ostrovskiy] Aleksandr Garyevich, this means once again  rules, instructions, methods... But specialists assure: Even  without this, we are swamped by controlling and regulating  documents!    [Nuzhnikov] I agree. The amount of paper is growing like a  snowball. But the state of affairs, unfortunately, is almost  unchanging. Many instructions, especially departmental ones,  duplicate each other. At the same time, they do not provide  answers to other questions. Do you know who works today on  control in the currency-export sphere? The Ministry of Foreign  Economic Relations, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of  Economics, the Main Customs Administration, and the Central  Bank. But too many cooks spoil the broth. Inspections show that  there are many holes in the legislation through which money  flows past the treasury.    [Ostrovskiy] For example?    [Nuzhnikov] The splitting up and transfer of quotas. Even  though this is forbidden, quotas for the export of strategically  important raw materials are endlessly transferred from  intermediary to intermediary until the possibility of monitoring  the transaction vanishes. And accounts get blurred because of  the great number of banks. There is no reliable control over the  returnability of the currency to the country.    [Ostrovskiy] Can you propose another procedure?    [Nuzhnikov] There already are outlines for new rules. The  right to export strategically important commodities will be  granted only to major exporters. Strong, qualified, authorized  banks will handle these operations. On government instructions  we will verify the fulfillment of quotas allocated last year for  the export of oil and the export operations of the Magnitogorsk,  Cherepovets, West Siberia, and Norilsk metallurgical combines.  We will examine conditions of contracts, their fulfillment, and  the return of the share of currency belonging to the state. When  we finish the work, a lot will be clarified, and we will be able  to make the new documents more accurate and reliable.    [Ostrovskiy] There are a lot of commercial structures in the  country that are engaged in currency operations without the  right to them. Will they also fall within your field of vision?    [Nuzhnikov] What is first and foremost for us here is not so  much punishment of the guilty as creation of a legal base. You,  for example, know about the discussions concerning the firm GMM,  which accepts hard currency and rubles at interest from physical  and juridical persons without having a bank license. A lot can  be done today, there is no legal base. However, it is not only  this firm, but any commercial bank can cash any amount of hard  currency and give permission for its export.    [Ostrovskiy] But are you not afraid of being accused of  restoring a state monopoly in currency-export operations and  thereby of hampering market reforms in Russia?    [Nuzhnikov] State control is compatible with the market. In  France, currency control is a function of the customs service as  a subdivision of their finance ministry. England had strict  control over currency-export operations until it created an  orderly system of laws that protected the interests of the  state. I think that we will take specifically the English  experience as a basis.    [Ostrovskiy] Will there be a long wait for the new  legislation?    [Nuzhnikov] In the near future, we will submit to committees  of the State Duma drafts of supplements and amendments to laws:  "On Currency Regulation, Banks and Banking Activity," and to the  Criminal Code and the Civil Code. After all, there is nothing in  today's legislation except for the notorious Article 80,  according to which anyone can be made answerable. Or there is  also this kind of a passage: Violations and those guilty have  been found. Who will recover that which belongs to the state?  Who is confiscating property and selling it? In our opinion,  such powers should be assigned to tax police.    [Ostrovskiy] In a word, the immediate task is to perfect the  legislation. Where will you get the people for such work?    [Nuzhnikov] There are no specialists with this kind of  profile in the country. We are learning and learning. Primarily  specialists of the former Gosplan [State Planning Commission]  and other state services come to us. Former state employees who  have experience in work in commercial structures are especially  valuable.    Russia undoubtedly needs a federal service that is  capable of weaving a dense net from the laws and rules in order  not to let even one kopek into foreign borders. But there is  something in the plans of the managers of this service that  compels one to ponder. First of all, the desire to subordinate  all and everything that concerns currency and export to the  state and its structures. Has the experience of Ukraine really  not taught anything, where a similar practice could only  aggravate the crisis in the economy and finances? Also not  understandable are the hopes for future legal acts as a means of  fighting violators. After all, even today's legislation makes it  possible to make criminally answerable firms that work with  finances and currency without a license of the Central Bank. God  forbid that the new structure sees its purpose only in petty  control and guardianship over exporters, banks, and  businessmen.</p>

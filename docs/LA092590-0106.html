			<p><P> September 25, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA;  </P> <P> RESIDENTS SAY POLICE SLOW IN RESPONDING  </P> <P> The Police Department is investigating complaints that officers were slow in  responding to a brawl in which a 17-year-old youth was killed.  </P> <P> The youth, who remained unidentified Monday, was fatally shot in the chest late  Saturday night at a wedding reception at a house in the 1300 block of South  Rosewood Avenue.  </P> <P> Another unidentified youth received gunshot wounds and is in serious condition  at Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo.  </P> <P> The shooting occurred three days after Santa Ana police announced that gang  violence was on the decline. It was a record 13th gang-related killing this  year in the city.  </P> <P> Some residents continued to express anger Monday at the way police handled the  call.  </P> <P> "I still believe a life could have been saved if they had gotten here when they  were called out," said Frank Balderrama, who lives on the same street.  </P> <P> Balderrama said he called 911 four times to report the scene that preceded the  killing.  </P> <P> "They (police) asked me if I was willing to sign a complaint," Balderrama said.  "I told them they had a riot on their hands. Let them produce the tapes and  show us what these so-called emergencies were" that delayed the arrival of  police.  </P> <P> Santa Ana police had no immediate response to the charges beyond saying that  officers are reviewing the 911 tapes.  </P> <P> "We are gathering information about the calls to see how many there were and  when they were received," Lt. Robert Helton said. DAVAN MAHARAJ  </P></p>

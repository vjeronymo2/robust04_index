			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Convulsions of the body politic: John Lloyd reviews the changes that have followed the death of Soviet communism, during his four-year posting in Moscow You are transported by calamity Thither where more attends you - William Shakespeare, Coriolanus. It is a banal conclusion to draw after four years in the former Soviet Union, but it is worth remembering - that so much, here, is not what it seems. The rational expectations of the western mind smash against contemporary Byzantinism - a brew of secrecy, bureaucratic inertia and a love of dissimulation. Russia and the other former Soviet republics preserve, in living form, traces of previous ages which the less subtle and happier states of the west have suppressed and mummified. The layers of Russian political society - the liberals, the modernisers, the communists, the nationalists, the Slavophiles and the imperialists - remain. They find expression still in the labyrinths of the bureaucracies, in the media, in the government and regional leaderships and apparatuses, and most influentially in the network of competing aides, advisers and guardians of Boris Yeltsin. I moved to Russia at the low point of Mikhail Gorbachev's efforts to modernise the Soviet Union - as commandos killed demonstrators in Lithuania and Latvia, the least assimilated of the former Soviet states. I cease to be correspondent as a more brutal assault is launched against Chechnya, territory of a people who have kept warm their wrath against Russia for over a century and who - it can be judged - will not let it cool again soon. Plus ca change . . .? On the contrary. Everything is changing, as the death throes of the greatest social engineering project in history - Soviet communism - convulse the political body, and the order that will replace it refuses to take choate shape. The Financial Times has been part of a western liberal consensus on the break-up of the Soviet Union: it was enthusiastic for the disintegrative process. The new elites of the post Soviet states appeared to want a liberal order: Mikhail Gorbachev was unable to provide it, caught as he was in the contradictions of his chaotic programme - a 'market' which could not be based on private property and a 'democracy' which would always choose socialism. Gorbachev's manoeuvres were seen as the tactics of a fatally constrained man with a vision of himself as a guardian of progress, endowing the Soviet people with elements of western liberalism while restraining them within the bounds of an empire they had not chosen and an economy in which they could not be free actors. This view, widely held abroad and by the post-Soviet democrats, was (I still believe) correct - but it did not, perhaps could not, comprehend the consequences of the fall of the communist system. Those of us whose tour as reporters spanned the end of the Soviet Union and the beginning of the post-Soviet states saw the latter as struggling to be free from the coils of the former. Our natural inclination, as westerners whose mindsets were formed in a postwar world where material standards were constantly rising, was to be optimistic - to assume that the remnants of tyranny would be succeeded by the sturdy shoots of independence. I had seen something which could plausibly be described in that way in three years of reporting in central and eastern Europe. The belief was - it was not subjected to much analysis - that the Soviet system had been a prison of belief, of nations, of free thought and association, of enterprise. It had: but the prisoners had in most cases known nothing else but prison life. Like old trusties, many liked it, or at least found it impossible to adapt to the loss of confinement. Generalisations should always be qualified. The Baltic states are different societies from the Central Asians; Moldova has little in common with Azerbaijan. In attempting to rediscover, or fabricate, their own traditions, the new states plunder the traditions of Islam, Orthodoxy, Lutheranism and Catholicism; tribalism, autocracy and democracy; mercantilism, corporatism and neo-liberalism. The Pope visits Vilnius to give a liberated flock a sense of belonging to the Catholic family; Professor Jeffrey Sachs seeks to ingrain liberal economics in the mindsets of the post-Soviet reformers in Russia and Ukraine; Mr Lee Kuan Yu calls on the President of Kazakhstan and proposes an authoritarian capitalism. In a late 20th century world, the educated elites can travel to and observe a political supermarket of social and political developments to which they may aspire, but cannot attain. The 15 states which made up the union now have in common a past: but their capacity to deal with it varies hugely. Much of my time was spent reporting 'reform'. The reformers in Russia were men and women who had largely been in the middling ranks of the professional intelligentsia and who were suddenly given vast power. Their vision, especially their economic vision of a liberal market economy, was given the imprimatur of the Russian president even before the union collapsed, because it appeared to be the only one available. It was the theoretical opposite of communism: it fitted with the internationalisation of capital which is the dominant theme of our times; it was promoted by men of brilliance, such as Yegor Gaidar, Anatoly Chubais and Boris Fyodorov. Reform in Russia is not dead. The liberations promoted by these men and their associates have entered the bloodstream and are dynamising its society. Their inherent belief - that freedom depends on independent economic actors - is being sorely tested and lacks the support it enjoyed from a now ailing and isolated president. But ranged against it there are only the (powerful, to be sure) remnants of now dysfunctional faiths and reflexes, capable of disruption but without the cohesive and ruthless philosophy-in-action of communism. Like other foreign media, the Financial Times reports on the 15 states of the former Soviet Union from Moscow - though with the advantage of colleagues in Ukraine, in Central Asia and in the Caucasus. The experience of travelling (on the fearful Aeroflot and its still more fearful scores of successor companies) has been one of sharing in small measure the disorienting experience for Russians of seeing a centralised empire dislocate as new leaderships attempt to make states of what had been satrapies. In each there was an initial burst of energy and support for the new leaders - in many cases, especially in Central Asia, the old leaders hastily repainted themselves in nationalist, even sometimes in religious, guise. In each, as time wore on, there has been a closing of the political space: a hasty re-buttressing of power and privilege, an appalled realisation of the malignity of the Soviet legacy and the frailty of the tools of their 'independence'. But the passage of time also revealed the vast differences in cultures which had been smothered by Sovietism. Its collapse faced societies with the often purgatorial task of defining in what their statehood might consist. It was not a surprise to see Estonia take off smartly in a Scandinavian direction. It has been more surprising to see little Kyrgyzstan struggle to embed an unfamiliar democracy in its impoverished valleys. Ukraine, in which the FT has had a correspondent since 1991 and to which it has rightly devoted much space, suffers from travails less dramatic than Russia's but in some ways more wrenching. Its best-known split is between the 'nationalist' west and the 'unionist' east. More deeply, most Ukrainians - a people even more cruelly devastated this century than their neighbours, the Poles - are also torn between belief in national development and uncertainty as to how it is to be given a solid base distinct from Russia, whose reflex is still to view such efforts with derision. It, and all other post Soviet nations, have played a large part in the suddenly revived debate on nations and nationalism - a discipline which may fill something of the yawning gap left by the sudden disappearance of Sovietology. A unionist Scot myself, I disliked nationalism, seeing it as narrowing, kitsch-ridden and coercive: the past four years have produced substantial modifications in that view. For it became clear that the Soviet Union, the last great, perverted Enlightenment fantasy of internationalism, could not and cannot be used as a basis for either modernisation or democratisation. The successor states have nothing else on which to base their search for both (if search they will) but nation statehood - even if that is the artificial construct of a system which never meant them to be nations in the first or last place. They are thus doomed to find statehood under terrible conditions. My last trip as correspondent in Moscow was to Grozny, the capital of Chechnya - where, as this is written, colleagues are still reporting from under the now-constant bombing raids, in a courageous display of what our trade can do at its best: producing the evidence of the effects of power. It was a terrible trip - not for the discomfort and the fear, but for the hellish vision it presented. The Chechens, most ferocious of the Caucasian tribes who pinned down Tsarist armies for the middle decades of the last century, are led and inspired by men who see no immorality in subjecting them to the most hopeless odds - indeed, who glorify it as the will of Allah, as much a prophet of peace as the one whose birthday is celebrated tomorrow. The Russians, by turns doubtful and brutal, are driving towards what the liberals here in the capital see as a fatal collision with the frail gains of the past three years. Right now, it is hard to shrug off their pessimism. The president has all but disappeared, his least savoury aides wield most power, the parliament's purchase is meagre, the military and the secret services act largely independently - and, more dangerously, in mutual distrust. Pushed to defend national integrity by the screeching of the nationalists, Russia has shed blood in a land whose culture demands that the stain be exorcised, and whose young men will see honour in revenge. The Caucasian circle comprehends more than this theatre of war: Abkhazia and Nagorno Karabakh have both been (uncounted) killing grounds and may be again. This is not yet the scale of the Bosnian barbarisms, but it begins to court comparison. No happy ending. Civil society, the prize promised to those who survived communism, yet remains out of the reach of most: the ending of the old order accomplished much more readily than the attainment of a new. Chrystia Freeland will succeed John Lloyd as Moscow bureau chief in January. Lloyd will continue to write for the FT, while working on a book</p>

			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Fisons It was something of an achievement for Fisons to deliver yesterday's full year results without any more nasty surprises. Pharmaceuticals sales growth of 7 per cent is respectable enough, while the condition of the scientific instruments division - the cause of December's profits warning - is not deteriorating. If that record can be maintained, Fisons may finally deserve to be judged squarely on its recovery prospects. A combination of modest sales growth, cost savings and loss elimination could, after all, deliver decent earnings growth. There are still risks. Drug sales rest on two asthma treatments - Intal and Tilade - for which the outlook is difficult to judge. Intal faces competition from cheap generic alternatives. Tilade's US launch seems to be going well enough, but it is too early to draw firm conclusions. Disappointment from either drug would undermine any profits recovery. Even assuming both products perform admirably, Fisons' research pipeline remains worryingly empty. Licensing potential products from outside companies could help solve that problem. Since Fisons has a mixed record in development and lacks a chief executive, though, the omens for such deal-making are not auspicious. Failure to secure a full raft of promising development projects would make the marriage of cash-generative laboratory supplies, instruments and pharmaceuticals difficult to justify. Unless the pipeline can be filled in short order, breaking Fisons up and finding a partner in pharmaceuticals may still be the best way of unlocking value.</p>

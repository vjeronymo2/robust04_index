			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Vasiliy Fatigarov report: "Russia's Counterintelligence -- </F> Special Service Without Investigative Functions and Lefortovo"]    [Text] A press conference, timed to coincide with the  creation of the Federal Counterintelligence Service [FCS], was  held in Moscow yesterday. Taking part in it were Sergey  Stepashin, first deputy director of the FCS, and Yuriy Baturin,  assistant to the president of the Russian Federation for  national security.    Henceforth the FCS, in terms of both its structure and its  purpose, will be a special service which will in no way mirror  the former Ministry of Security. In Sergey Stepashin's opinion,  "all prerequisites for the revival of political surveillance  have been destroyed." The new service is intended only to  expose and terminate operations by foreign special services  against the Russian Federation and "to acquire information about  threats to our country's security." It is also tasked with  waging a struggle against terrorism, the imports of weapons and  drugs, and the struggle against illegal armed formations.  Despite the fact that the Border Guard Troops have evolved into  an autonomous service, the FCS will continue to provide  counterintelligence backup for the effective protection of  Russia's state borders.    Although the FCS is the successor of the former Ministry of  Security, it will henceforth be subordinate only to the  president. The service has parted with its Investigations  Directorate, having transferred its establishment to the General  Prosecutor's Office. And the notorious Lefortovo prison has been  transferred to the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs].  Nonetheless, the former Ministry of Security's operational and  technical services remain under the FCS. The question about  transferring the "Alpha" and "Vimpel" special subunits to the  FCS has not been raised yet.    According to Stepashin, the FCS's creation became necessary  in light of the growing corruption within power structures, the  stepped up activity of foreign special services from both nearby  and distant foreign countries, and the attempts to recruit state  apparatus officials. Last year alone, 20 persons were sentenced  for espionage against Russia.    The press conference participants also dwelled on the  problems of social protection for FCS military personnel.  Former Ministry of Security staffers who have failed the  certification process can either transfer to other state  structures or take retirement with all statutory benefits.    Cutbacks in the FCS's numerical strength have affected  primarily the central apparatus. Whereas the service as a whole  will be 46 percent smaller than the former Russian Federation  Ministry of Security, the center will employ only 1,500 instead  of 3,500 staffers. Cutbacks apply primarily to backup and  management structures, rather than to operational structures.</p>

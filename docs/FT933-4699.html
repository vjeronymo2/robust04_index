			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Pretoria veto overhangs power sharing: Patti Waldmeir looks at the implications of yesterday's milestone agreement in South Africa AFTER 350 years as a powerless majority, South African blacks have finally gained their first taste of power in national government with last night's agreement to establish a multi-racial transitional executive council. Agreement on the council will lead to the early lifting of international economic sanctions against South Africa and will send an important signal to South African blacks and the international community that South Africa's transition to multi-racial rule is irreversible. After months of increasingly arcane debate over South Africa's constitutional future, the council represents the first step toward multi-racial interim government. But true to form, negotiators have decided to delay concrete action until later: tortuous negotiations on a new democratic constitution must be completed before any of the 21 councillors can take their seats. The powers of the council, which will include one representative from all parties to the current constitutional negotiations, including the South African government and the African National Congress, will be largely symbolic. Its remit is to 'level the political playing field' and create the conditions for free elections on April 27 next year; it is far from clear what that will mean in practice. Furthermore, government will have what amounts to a veto over the council's most important power as its decisions must be passed by majorities ranging from two-thirds to 80 per cent majority. Government officials believe that Pretoria and its allies will be able to muster the votes necessary to block TEC decisions, though they argue that the ruling National party would pay a high political price if it is seen to play a spoiling role. ANC officials also play down the risk of a government veto, arguing Pretoria wants to use the TEC to cement the de facto coalition between the two parties which will govern South Africa after the elections - and that government will avoid acrimony which could tear that coalition apart. Still, when it comes to issues of fundamental importance to Pretoria, it is hard to see government refraining from using that veto. The council is likely to be further undermined by the fact that the third big political player, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi of the Inkatha Freedom party, is refusing to participate and has said that the government of the KwaZulu black homeland, which he heads, will not respect its authority. Other homeland governments and the right-wing Conservative party have also rejected the TEC, raising the prospect of further bloodshed when it tries to impose its authority in homeland areas. Homeland opposition to the council could be reversed, however, if the new constitution satisfies homeland leaders by providing significant devolution of power to regional governments. Leaders, including Chief Buthelezi, are looking for a package deal: if they like the constitution, they will tolerate the TEC. Their participation is crucial if the council is to have broad legitimacy. The council would remain in office until the elections, when it would be replaced by an elected government of national unity based on multi-racial power-sharing. However if elections are delayed, it could remain in power indefinitely, and have its powers extended to become a fully-fledged interim government. According to a bill agreed yesterday by negotiators (parliament must still pass the bill, but the ruling National party's large majority should make this a formality) the TEC's object is to 'create a climate for free political participation', foster conditions for free and fair elections, eliminate impediments to legitimate political activity, prevent intimidation, ensure parties are free to canvass and campaign and prevent government from exercising its powers to its own political advantage, or to prejudice others. Its decisions will be legally enforceable. In addition, the TEC will play a watchdog role in a wide range of other areas, including government finance, compelling government to disclose information and to consult it on certain matters. The full extent of its powers will depend on how broadly the TEC interprets its mission to create a climate for free and fair political activity. The TEC will have seven sub-councils, covering law and order, defence, intelligence, finance, regional and local government, foreign affairs, and the status of women. The sub-councils on law and order, defence and intelligence are likely to prove the most important, providing for limited joint control of the security forces in the volatile period ahead of next year's elections. It will be difficult to declare a state of emergency or period of martial law without its support, though the Police Board and the Special Electoral Court, respectively, can overrule it in these matters. South Africa's prospects for holding free and fair elections depend crucially on the success of the security forces in controlling political violence, which has recently reached a new pitch of intensity. Controversially, the TEC will also establish its own security force, the National Peacekeeping Force, charged with 'maintaining peace and public order", and to be commanded by a council controlled by the TEC itself. The force will be comprised of members of all military forces, including the South African Defence Force, the police, Umkhonto we Sizwe (the ANC military wing), other liberation armies and homeland forces. The TEC itself will comprise one member from each political party or government participating in constitutional negotiations. The sub-council on finance will have power to investigate and monitor government finance, to be consulted in the preparation of the 1994-95 budget, and to be informed about negotiations involving international financial agreements (such as the current debt rescheduling). But its approval will not be required except in areas where government finance would affect the elections, and over the creation of new government posts and retirements.</p>

			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Matrix QC hits at use of immunity certificates Public confidence in the criminal justice system has been damaged by the government's attempt to use public interest immunity to prevent documents being disclosed during the Matrix Churchill trial, the chief prosecutor in the case told the Scott inquiry yesterday. Mr Alan Moses QC also said ministers should use their discretion when considering making PII applications - a stance that contradicts the advice Sir Nicholas Lyell QC, the attorney-general, gave ministers who signed PII certificates to stop evidence being heard by the Matrix Churchill jury. Mr Moses said ministers should not apply 'mechanically' for PII certificates. They had to use their judgment about whether the release of documents would really damage the national interest. If they thought disclosure would have this effect, they were under a duty to apply for PII. Sir Nicholas, who gives evidence to the inquiry tomorrow, has argued since the trial that ministers are always under a duty to seek PII and should not use their discretion. Mr Moses told Lord Justice Scott: 'A minister would be ill-advised to sign a certificate unless he was satisfied about the reasoning of the prosecution, for fear that he would be accused of withholding documents or signing gagging writs. 'Then he is subjecting himself to the sort of furore that happened in this case - which is something I can well understand.' He said the Matrix Churchill trial had produced a reaction that 'we the public no longer find it acceptable and cannot have faith and trust in a fair trial if this kind of thing is going on'. Mr Moses said he had never been told of the reservations held by Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, about signing the PII certificates. Had he known of Mr Heseltine's objections he would have used a different argument in asking for PII to apply. Mr Moses strongly denied the claim by Mr Andrew Leithead, an assistant Treasury solicitor, that the reason he had removed an index from documents to be shown to the judge was in the hope that the judge would be less likely to read the documents. With hindsight, he should not have done this, Mr Moses admitted. He was not, however, trying to deceive the judge, he said. There were very senior lawyers in the room with him at the time. If they thought it an illegitimate tactic they should have told him so, he said.</p>

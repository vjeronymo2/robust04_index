			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Dutch study hits at Unilever detergent Unilever's new laundry detergent was criticised yesterday by the Dutch consumers' association, which concluded after tests that 'the damage' the detergent did to some clothes was 'too great'. Unilever rejected the report, which is likely to intensify the 'Soap War' raging between the Anglo-Dutch group and Procter and Gamble since Unilever launched the power detergents this summer. P&amp;G is highly critical of the detergents' alleged effect on clothes. Omo Power, sold as Persil Power in the UK, was as effective at washing clothes 'as any other good washing powder and bleach,' the Dutch association said. But some fabrics, particularly coloured cotton, had been 'damaged' in the test. 'The data is partial and being used in a very emotive way,' Unilever said. It criticised the association for making 'sweeping statements' comparing Omo Power to other detergents when, it said, it had run tests against only one other unnamed detergent. It said the association had also failed to judge the effect on clothes and the alleged lessening of tensile strength, which enables a garment to resume its shape after being stretched, against textile industry standards. It is understood Unilever has seen the full data from the Dutch association's tests and found them comparable to data from six independent test institutes it commissioned to study the detergent. The six institutes found the effect the detergent had on clothes was acceptable and fell within textile industry standards. In the UK, the Consumers' Association is conducting its own tests on Persil Power but results will not be ready before mid-December. Marks &amp; Spencer, also conducting tests, said it did not know when they would be completed. 'We continue to monitor the level of returned clothes but there's nothing that causes immediate concern.' Unilever said the impact of the Dutch report would be limited; sales of all products in the Omo brand had not been harmed. Albert Heijn, the Dutch supermarket chain, said: 'We see no reason to take it out of our shops. We will wait to see what consumers do.' P&amp;G welcomed the report. 'This cannot come as any surprise in light of the evidence that had already emerged,' said Mr David Veitch, P&amp;G's European vice-president of communications.</p>

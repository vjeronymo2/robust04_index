			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, April 6 (TANJUG) -- The Moslem Autonomous  Province of Western Bosnia (APWB) would join the Moslem-Croat  federation in the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina  only if the Bosnian Serb republic (R.S.) joined it, APWB  President Fikret Abdic has said.    Abdic told the Yugoslav magazine SVET that he welcomed every  step towards a lasting peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina and that the  Washington Moslem-Croat agreement was positive on condition it  was not another Moslem-Croat coalition against the Serb people.    He said the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina would not stop until  all three warring sides -- Moslems, Serbs and Croats -- were  brought to the negotiating table to reach an agreement on just  and lasting peace.    Abdic set out Izetbegovic was to blame for the two-year  bloodshed in Bosnia-Herzegovina, although the world had without  any proof largely demonized the Serb people.    Izetbegovic is not interested in peace and his  fundamentalist  policy is aimed solely at creating an Islamic state in the  Balkans, Abdic set out and said his departure from the political  stage would be a relief to everyone, most of all Moslems, said  Abdic.    Abdic stated that his policy was mainly aimed at achieving  peace. He said that the APWB and the R.S., the state of Bosnian  Serbs, had signed an agreement on the cessation of hostilities  and establishing of cooperation in the fields of economy,  culture and sport.    The APWB had also signed an agreement on cooperation with  the  republic of Serb Krajina (R.S.K.)    The R.S.K. was proclaimed in 1991 on the ethnic and  historical territories in the former Yugoslav republic of  Croatia in response to Croatia's forcible secession from the  former Yugoslav federation.    Abdic had also signed with the state of Bosnian Croats --  Herceg-Bosna, an agreement of the same content.    According to the Moslem-controlled Sarajevo Radio, some 500  Moslems were killed and over 2,000 were wounded so far in the  clashes between Izetbegovic's and Abdic's over the past six  months.    A moderate Moslem politician, Abdic, opposes the belligerent  policy of fundamentalist Moslem leader Alija Izetbegovic and has  proclaimed the Autonomous Province of Western Bosnia (APWB) last  September.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Nikolaos Bellos from Brussels] </F>   [Text] Alternate Foreign Minister Theodhoros Pangalos  described the Greek legal arguments [on measures taken against  The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] as extremely  well founded. Referring to the political aspect of the measures,  Pangalos said that Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou's relevant  letter is already in the hands of European Commission President  Jacques Delors.    In light of the submission of the Greek memorandum to the  European Commission, Pangalos said that he had a telephone  conversation with Greek Commissioner Ioannis Palaiokrasas and  agreed to meet him on Monday afternoon [28 February] in  Brussels. They will discuss ways of cooperation to deal with  the issue further.</p>

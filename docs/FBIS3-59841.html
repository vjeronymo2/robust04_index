At the outset of the meeting, the  minister conveyed the greetings of Amir Shaykh Khalifah  Bin-Hamad Al Thani's and Crown Prince Shaykh Hamad Bin-Khalifah  Al Thani to the Yemeni president, and to the people of Yemen of  their wishes for continued prosperity and growth. His  Excellency, the minister spoke of the special relations that  bind the sisterly countries and are undergoing continuous  improvement. For his part, the Yemeni president expressed his  profound pleasure with the level of development of Yemeni-Qatari  relations, and affirmed Yemen's desire to advance these  relations to a higher level for the benefit of the sisterly  countries and our Arab and Islamic nation. The meeting was  attended by the Yemeni Minister of Information and his  accompanying delegation. The session on Qatari-Yemeni  informational talks had begun before noon yesterday under the  chairmanship of the information ministers of the two countries,  His Excellency Dr. Hamad Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Kuwari and Hasan  Ahmad al-Lawzi.    At the start of the talks, Yemeni Minister of Information  Hasan al-Lawzi welcomed Dr. Hamad Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Kuwari  and his accompanying delegation, and said: "I am happy and  gratified for your response in accepting the invitation to visit  your country, the Republic of Yemen, which has experienced a new  impetus to improve bilateral relations, not only on the  informational and cultural level, but also on informational,  cultural, and other levels as well. This level will also serve  to actuate all existing areas of cooperation between the two  sister countries."    He added: "I hope this visit will avail you of the  opportunity to examine closely all aspects of life in Yemen, and  to become intimately acquainted with the true nature of  conditions, achievements, and changes that have taken place in  this country. This visit will be an opportunity for us, through  yourselves, to become acquainted with the procession of progress  in the State of Qatar and which we follow, whenever possible,  over all media. Hence, we affirm our pride in the judicious and  equable policy of our second country, the State of Qatar,  whether it involves its bilateral or regional relations, its  policy and program of national endeavors, or its joint Arab  activity. And if our praise is praise generally directed, it  would be incumbent upon us to specifically praise the bilateral  relations of the two sisterly nations, for they are special and  evolving relations. We indeed hope that our relations be such  that they form a positive model in our Arab homeland, especially  as we live in a single geographical area, which affirms the  importance of enhancing informational and cultural cooperation".  He added, "By such scope, we are able to present an honorable  example of relations in all areas".    In his speech, the Yemeni minister broached the domains of  informational and cultural cooperation, saying, "A cooperation  was signed here in Sanaa in May of 1990; through its  implementation, we will achieve positive steps in the area of  informational cooperation".  <H5>  Qatari Information Minister's Speech </H5>   The Yemeni minister then presented the floor to Dr. Hamad  Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Kuwari, who thanked, on his own behalf and  that of the members of the delegation, the dispatch of the  hospitable invitation to visit Yemen. He added: "I express my  thanks and those of the members of the accompanying delegation  for this hospitable invitation to visit our second homeland,  this ancient, sisterly country with a special place in the soul  of every Arab. Since each of us was looking forward to visiting  this dearly beloved country, we could not but accept the  invitation. We have experienced pleasure ever since setting foot  in this country, and we thank you for your gracious hospitality  and your generosity, a generosity that we became aware of from  the very start and one that is not surprising, for you are of  the Arab fold, and generosity is the most prominent  characteristic of Arabs."    He continued: "This visit is among a series that seek to  develop and improve relations between our two sisterly  countries. These visits were initiated a short time ago by the  visit of His Excellency Foreign Minister Shaykh Hamad Bin-Jasim  Bin-Jabbur Al-Thani, who visited your sisterly country and  discussed with its leaders all aspects of mutual relations. In  continuation of that process, begun by the foreign minister, we  are here today to focus on an important and vital aspect, one  that is as important as all others, that of informational and  cultural relations. Information has become a mark of this era,  especially in the global development of communications. Thus, we  are in support of this meeting as well as the exchange of  opinions on the manner of dealing with this vital aspect, that  which has been decreed by the scientific, technological and  informational development in the world as a whole."    In the course of his speech, the minister congratulated the  people of Yemen on the realization of unification, and said: "I  am pleased to congratulate the people of Yemen on their  achievements, especially the unification of Yemen, which we hope  becomes more firmly established each passing day, and becomes an  example to be followed by Arabs as a whole. We wish you success  and prosperity in this unity, which has realized not only a  dream of Yemenis, but one of Arabs as a whole. We realize the  challenges that confront you in the area of development; despite  the obstacles involved, you have been successful in achieving a  great deal. We look forward to the development of relations in  the interests of both sisterly peoples. I would like to signal  out and commend the role of the sisterly Yemeni expatriate  community and its contributions to the development of Qatar.  This is a fact that cannot be denied; on the contrary, we  express it with profound appreciation, as our Yemeni brethren  have lived in Qatar and taken part in its development from the  very start. Many of them are Qatari citizens, and they have been  good to a fault, while all their deeds have had the best  interests of Qatar in mind. To them, we convey our thanks and  appreciation.    I hope that this visit is a springboard of benefit, begun by  the fOreign minister, for development of relations in various  areas, especially that of information and culture, which  possibly we may be able to discuss during this session. The  discussion of this topic starts from a discussion of the  informational agreement signed by ex-Minister of Information  (now Minister of Health) Shaykh Hamad Bin-Suhaym in May 1990,  along with brother Hasan al-Lawzi. Unfortunately, certain  circumstances, passing as a summer cloud does, precluded  follow-up on the matter. But a summer cloud passes rapidly,  leaving ever-clear skies. Thus, God willing, we begin  implementing this agreement, and consideration of the means to  bolster relations between our two countries in all areas."  <H5>  Informational Agreement Implementation Talks </H5>   Later, the two parties initiated the discussion of means to  develop the informational agreement signed two years ago, which  encompassed coordination and cooperation in the domains of  radio, television, news agencies, literature and newspapers, as  well as aspects of training. Also discussed was enhancement of  the role of the Khalifa Institute for Radio and Television,  established at Qatar's expense, as well as the role of the  committee during the forthcoming phase, which would enable  advancement of the implementation of the agreement to its  fruition. In this connection, the two sides affirmed the  importance of follow-up for implementation of the agreement. It  was agreed that the implementation follow-up committee meet next  January in Doha. The Yemeni committee is headed by Ministry of  Information Assistant Deputy Amma al-'Alim al-Suswa, External  Information General Manager Iskander al-Asbahi and Planning and  Follow-Up General Manager Muhi al-Hamdani, while the Qatari  committee is headed by Qatar Ministry of Information Assistant  Deputy for Information Shaykh Hamad Bin-Thamir Al-Thani.    During the talks session, the Yemeni side heard of Qatar's  experience in the areas of radio and television, specifically  the satellite channel, and particularly as Qatar enjoys a 19.5  percent interest in ARABSAT. In this context, Dr. Hamad said  that Qatar is focusing on enhancement of the public program and  the English channel on television, that they become acceptable  viewing in a number of Arab countries.    On the Qatari side, the talks session was attended by  Assistant Deputy for Information, Shaykh Hamad Bin-Thamir  Al-Thani, Radio Director Mubarak Jiham al-Kawari, Follow-Up and  Planning Director 'Abdallah Sadik, and Public Relations Manager  Ahmad al-Jida.    On the Yemeni side: Deputy Minister of Information Muthir  Ahmad Taki, Ministry of Information Assistant Deputy Amma  al-'Alim al-Suswa, Radio and Television Board Chairman Muhammad  'Abd-al-Qawi, Public Program's Radio Sector Manager Ahmad  al-Noubi, Ministry of Information's Information Department  Official Salih Hajar, Director of the Khalifa Institute for  Radio and Television 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Mishrib, Public Relations  General Manager 'Abdallah al-Sindi, Planning and Follow-Up  General Manager Muhi al-Hamdani, and Deputy General Manager of  Public Relations Intisar Khalid. Tomorrow, the Qatari minister  and his accompanying delegation will go on a fact-finding trip  outside the capital of Sanaa.</p>

			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / Seven qualities of the ideal entrepreneur Researchers at Durham University claim to have identified seven factors which indicate which entrepreneurs have the greatest potential for business success. The seven factors are: Vision - the ability to project an image into the future of where the individual would like their business to be. Need for achievement - motivation to succeed and the ability to set realistic goals and a structure to achieve them. Need for autonomy, but also an ability to accept information and guidance from others. Calculated risk taking - the ability to evaluate risk and plan a strategy to reduce it. Opportunistic tendency - the ability to perceive opportunities for business development within the surrounding environment. Internal locus of control - an acceptance of personal responsibility for the business's performance rather than explaining success or failure by external factors such as luck and chance. Creativity and innovation. The conclusions were gleaned by Durham University Business School from a review of other research and tested on a sample of 16 graduate entrepreneurs and 100 past and present Midlands small businesses. Mr David Johnson, lecturer in entrepreneurship at the school, who directed the research, said: 'It may be crashingly obvious, but people don't seem to use the information.' The challenge, he said, was not only to define the entrepreneurial behaviour which can lead to business success but to devise a way of assessing accurately in what measure people have it and whether it can be developed through training. That information would be valuable to organisations such as banks and venture capital companies which have to decide who to back. 'The bottom line is, can you add any objectivity to the gut feeling when you're interviewing people and deciding whether to support them in running their own business?' he said. The initial findings, to be published in early 1994, will be linked to training workshops for users. The aim of the workshops is partly to prevent the seven factors, on each of which entrepreneurs are graded from 1 to 7, being used as a crude rejection tool. The 18-month Pounds 24,000 project was co-sponsored by CPCR, a Newcastle-based management consultancy, and County Durham and Leicestershire Training and Enterprise Councils. The seven factors, Mr Johnson stresses, are based on behaviour rather than innate personality, so business owners can influence their own success. Already he has one graphic example of a successful opportunistic tendency: one graduate entrepreneur interviewed for the research used this 'foot in the door' to fix up some work at the business school for her training agency.</p>

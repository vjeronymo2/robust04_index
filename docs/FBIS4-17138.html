			<p>BFN     [Text] [Announcer] The "Alioni" program welcomes you,  Batono Jaba [Ioseliani, chairman of the Georgian State Emergency  Committee]. Together with television viewers we are expecting  your report on the Georgian-Abkhaz talks in Geneva.    [Ioseliani] Good morning. What are you interested in?    [Announcer] What happened yesterday at the meeting between  the Georgian and Abkhaz delegations? Some documents were to be  discussed yesterday, I mean the documents worked out by UN and  Russian diplomats.    [Ioseliani] This document could have been used as the basis  but it was impossible to accept it in its present form. The  Abkhaz side yesterday suggested a completely unacceptable plan  -- as could have been expected -- to legalize what they gained  after the war. They are trying to breach Georgia's territorial  integrity and create a union of the two states, create a  confederation which will mean that there will be Georgia and  Abkhazia. They [Georgia and Abkhazia] would conclude an  alliance which would have a mutual body to regulate these two  states. This suggestion was completely unacceptable for the  United Nations, the Security Council, for us, and for everybody.  But there is an intermediate plan put forward by the United  Nations and the Russians and we are working on it now. We shall  see what will happen, although we have no great hopes because  yesterday they [the UN and the Russians] said that it was the  maximum that they could suggest as our [Georgians'] suggestions  were unacceptable for them [Abkhazians] and vice versa.    [Announcer] Batono Jaba, are the places where the  peacekeeping forces will be deployed mentioned in the documents,  or is this still to be discussed?    [Ioseliani] The question now is the political status [of  Abkhazia]. As you know, the issue of deployment has fallen  through. The Abkhazians then demanded the unacceptable: If the  peacekeeping forces were to enter the territory adjacent to the  Inguri river -- it was specified in the agreement that the UN  peacekeeping forces would have been deployed in the conflict  zone -- the Abkhazians demanded that peacekeeping forces also  enter the territories near Zugdidi. I do not think that  anything will be resolved today but we must still work on it.  Nothing ventured, nothing gained! And besides, the world must  learn what we are suggesting from the point of view of the  political settlement. Probably everything will have been  finished by tomorrow because I think nothing will happen today.    [Announcer] You have been listening to a member of the  [Georgian] delegation at the Georgian-Abkhaz talks in Geneva.</p>

			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / Bank is cheered by victory of inches: Mixed response to Lamont's 'independence' call OFFICIALS at the Bank of England were last night congratulating themselves in the belief that their long campaign for independence in monetary policy was inching towards success. Nobody would have been more pleased at Mr Norman Lamont's call for an independent central bank than Mr Eddie George, who takes over as Bank governor next month. The anti-inflation hawk has made plain that achieving stable growth without undue price rises would be made easier if the Bank rather than politicians controlled interest rates. Mr George was heartened not only by Mr Lamont's statement that for two and a half years he had tried to persuade Mr John Major that the Bank should be independent, but also by the prime minister's refusal to rule this out so long as Threadneedle Street could be accountable to parliament. The Bank said yesterday: 'We believe that the key objective of monetary policy is to safeguard the value of money, but that for so long as policies are in place which secure that, the precise constitutional status of the central bank is less important. 'That is the position now, in that the government is committed to an inflation target and the Bank of England has a role in monitoring its achievement. 'Nevertheless as the governor has said on many occasions, there are clear advantages in making the central bank directly responsible for achieving price stability, if only because this may enhance the credibility of policy.' Mr Lamont's campaign to change the prime minister's mind was known only to a few people. Mr Warwick Lightfoot, who was one of Mr Lamont's economic advisers between his taking over as chancellor in November 1990 and April 1992, said last night: 'The chancellor never discussed this idea within my earshot.' But it emerged last night that top Treasury officials worked on the plan early this year, providing papers which Mr Lamont gave to Mr Major before the Budget. The Treasury refused to divulge any details of discussions on the issue between Mr Lamont and Sir Terry Burns, Treasury permanent secretary. Sir Terry, then the Treasury's chief economic adviser, was among several top officials instructed in 1988 by Lord Lawson, the former chancellor, to work on a secret scheme to give the Bank independence. That plan was vetoed by Lady Thatcher, the former prime minister. It only came to light in Lord Lawson's resignation speech in 1989 which, in putting the case for taking control of borrowing costs away from ministers, was uncannily similar to Mr Lamont's address yesterday. One comment last night from someone who knows Mr Lamont is that the deposed chancellor - possibly subconsciously - was paying homage in his speech to the ideas of Lord Lawson, to whom he had been politically close. Bank officials yesterday said they had no knowledge that Mr Lamont had been trying to change government policy on this issue. During his tenure as chancellor Mr Lamont continually backed the government line that ministers should set interest rates. In an interview with the FT in December 1991 Mr Lamont said: 'Ministers are accountable to parliament for economic policy, including monetary policy, and I have no plans to change the status of the Bank of England in stage two (of European economic and monetary union which is supposed to last until close to the end of the 1990s).' In the interview he answered 'none whatsoever' to a question as to whether there were policy differences between him and the prime minister.</p>

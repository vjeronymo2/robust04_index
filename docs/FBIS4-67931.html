			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Viktor Litovkin of IZVESTIYA: ``Nuclear Alert </F> Canceled. Warheads Being Removed in Ukraine and Kazakhstan'']    [Text] At long last the problem that perturbed the whole  world after the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the  emergence in its place of four states with over 350 strategic  missiles with nuclear warheads on their territory is close to a  solution. Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Belorussia [Belarus] have  begun to consistently fulfill their juridical commitments  regarding nuclear disarmament.    ``All 46 RS-24 heavy missiles stationed in Ukraine have been  deactivated,'' Colonel General Igor Sergeyev, commander in chief  of the Strategic Missile Forces, has declared. ``Ukraine, and  also Kazakhstan and Belorussia, the other CIS countries where  our nuclear missile weapons are stationed for the moment, are  honestly and consistently fulfilling their international  commitments regarding nuclear disarmament.''    He made this statement at a meeting with foreign countries'  military attaches in Moscow. ``The deactivation of missiles,''  the general explained to your IZVESTIYA correspondent, ``means  that their nuclear warheads have been removed and have been  replaced by a special technical equivalent in order to ensure  the normal, accident-free functioning of missile systems, while  the missiles themselves no longer have targeting information  [lisheny poletnykh zadaniy]. They no longer threaten anyone.''    The commander in chief also disclosed that 20 missile  complexes of the RS-18 liquid-fueled missile whose guaranteed  operational lifetime had expired have been removed from alert  status, the rocket fuel and oxidant have been pumped out of  them, and the missiles have been readied for recycling  [utilizatsiya]. Already 120 nuclear warheads have been  withdrawn to Russia, and the rest will be dispatched to Russian  plants in accordance with the Russian-Ukrainian timetable in  conformity with the trilateral agreement concluded between  Russia, Ukraine, and the United States in January of this year.    Operational control of the missile complexes in Ukraine is  exercised from Moscow, administrative control from Kiev.    Agreement has also been reached with Kazakhstan on granting  Russian status to the strategic missile units stationed on that  sovereign state's territory. As IZVESTIYA has already noted,  there are 104 RS-20 (SS-18 in the NATO classification) missiles  with the biggest launch weight of 211 tonnes, with a throwweight  of 8.8 tonnes, and with 10 nuclear warheads on each missile in  the country. Now over a period of 14 months these warheads will  be removed from the missiles and withdrawn to Russian plants.    The recovery of missiles from silos and their dispatch for  recycling will take much more time and effort, but are to be  completed within three years. But Kazakhstan will become  totally nuclear-free as early as 1995. (Forty Tu-95MS strategic  bombers and 240 cruise missiles were withdrawn from its  territory a few months ago.) Admittedly, questions of paying  for the process of eliminating the nuclear-missile complex on  the state's territory have still not been resolved, but, judging  by the present state of intergovernmental relations between  Moscow and Alma-Ata [Almaty], the funding of the work to destroy  the missile silos will not cause great problems and  disagreements.    There are no disagreements between Moscow and Minsk on the  question of withdrawing strategic missiles from Belorussia's  territory. The ``Topol'' missiles are leaving Lida and Mozyr on  schedule, as IZVESTIYA reported in issue No 50 for 17 March.    Russia has now eliminated 302 launchers for its strategic  missiles and 403 missiles, and a further 600 will have been  destroyed by the year 2003. It is honestly fulfilling its  commitments under the START I treaty and is laying the  foundation for fulfilling the START II treaty.    According to the commander in chief of the Strategic Missile  Forces, strategic nuclear weapon delivery vehicles are  decreasing by one-third in our country and strategic missile  warheads [golovnyye chasti] by a factor of more than six. By  January 1996 the Strategic Missile Forces personnel will have  been cut by 25,000 men and the central apparatus of the Main  Staff and directorates will have been cut by 20 percent. Russia  currently has 1,050 launchers, and by the end of the century  there will be 800. Further reductions in strategic arms and  their development now depend also on the other states in the  ``nuclear club.''    Military experts and specialists in international relations  familiar with the problem of the nuclear disarmament of Ukraine  and Kazakhstan know that the process of reaching agreement here  was by no means simple and straightforward. It took great  efforts by the states' leaders, parliaments, and generals and,  naturally, by the U.S. Administration, Britain, and France and a  certain amount of political and economic pressure before the  parties to the multilateral dialogue were able to reach  agreement.    But the main thing has been achieved. The Treaty on the  Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons, of which Russia and the  United States are guarantors as countries keeping the treaty in  their state archives, will not be violated. The world community  has ensured that the nuclear club has not grown. And this means  there is the hope that no other states possessing these terrible  weapons of mass destruction will appear on the planet.    There is another conclusion that must be drawn from this  fact: The world community, provided that there is consensus  within it, is capable of solving many other problems of tricky  relations between states and within them by peaceful means. All  this takes is goodwill and awareness of its responsibility to  the peoples.</p>

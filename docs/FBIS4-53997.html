			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From MAINICHI SHIMBUN 25 May Morning Edition] </F>   [Excerpt] During a 24 May session of the House of  Representatives Budget Committee, Kazuo Shii of the Japan  Communist Party said that the United Nations will not adopt a  resolution slapping economic sanctions on the DPRK for its  suspected development of nuclear weapons. He then asked Prime  Minister Hata how Japan will deal with economic sanctions if the  United States and other nations impose them on North Korea. In  response, Prime Minister Hata stated: "If the United States and  other nations impose economic sanctions on the DPRK, Japan would  prepare for a state of emergency in accordance with the  Constitution. The economic sanctions imposed by the United  States and other nations are different from those slapped on by  the United Nations." In this way, the prime minister indicated  that Japan can take concerted action with the United States and  South Korea against North Korea.    During the session, however, Prime Minister Hata refused to  state specifically how Japan will deal with the economic  sanctions, saying: "Inspectors from the International Atomic  Energy Agency are now checking nuclear facilities in North  Korea, and it is a very delicate time. I therefore wish to  refrain from discussing at this session how Japan should deal  with the economic sanctions."

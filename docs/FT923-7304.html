			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Ministry warns on growth prospects THE German economics ministry yesterday laid down strict conditions which had to be met before the economy returns to the course of stable growth it maintained for most of the 1980s. Despite 'great uncertainties', the ministry said it expected average annual real growth of 2.5 per cent in the west, 9 per cent in the east and 3 per cent overall until at least the end of 1996. Western inflation, the key to the Bundesbank's interest rate policy, was unlikely to rise above an annual average of 3.5 per cent in the medium term. However, the ministry added, meeting its forecasts for the 1992-96 period depended on responsible wage settlements, restrictive government spending policy, and diversion of cash transfers to the east from consumption into capital investment. Worldwide economic recovery and a successful Gatt round on world trade were also crucial. Other assumptions in the ministry's model included the restoration of stability in eastern European markets and the former Soviet Union. The ministry's heavily hedged forecast coincided with a gloomy report from the federal banking association complaining that the west German economy had lost momentum. Finance ministry figures showed rising demand for federal funds. Social security spending is expected to rise more than 6 per cent next year to almost DM150bn and to DM160bn in 1996. The government only recently limited federal spending growth to a nominal 2.5 per cent a year. The federal statistics office added to the short-term apprehension with a report that average hourly wages in west Germany at the end of April were 7.2 per cent more than a year earlier. Economists, comparing the ministry's inflation forecasts with the central bank's target of 2 per cent, said that while there were good chances for growth, inflation would present a 'constant danger'. Mr Peter Pietsch at Commerzbank said he expected 'a very careful interest rates policy for the coming years'. He was calculating on average inflation in 1993 of 4 per cent, unchanged from this year. For east Germany, where inflation is likely to average 8 per cent, the economics ministry forecast an average annual increase in capital investment of 17 per cent. 'In good years', growth in the former GDR could move into double figures.</p>

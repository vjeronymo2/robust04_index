A man calling  himself "Mabuto" telephoned SAPA at 7.15am and said Azanla was  behind "the attack".    When asked if he meant the attack at Mdantsane's Baha'i  centre, near East London, he said: "That's right". He said he  was telephoning from the Eastern Cape but when pressed for  further information, the caller said he was "in a rush".    Three men were killed in an apparently racially motivated  attack by gunmen who burst into the centre, lined them up  against a wall and then shot them dead in cold blood.    SAPA could not independently verify the authenticity of the  call.</p>

The new rates are effective as of January 1, 1995. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CTA/CQ has designated the proposals as changing a charge collected on behalf of all the participants, permitting them to become effective upon filing, pursuant to the terms of Rule 11Aa3&hyph;2(c)(3)(i) under the Act. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments from interested persons on the amendments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> I. Description and Purpose of the Amendments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of the amendment is to recover the ticker network expense increases that common carriers have recently imposed on the CTA Plan Participants. The present fees of $110.00 per connection for Network A and Network B have been in effect since 1985. Since 1985, each of the Networks has absorbed a number of increases in common carrier costs. The most recent increases effected in August 1994, however, were significant and CTA has determined to pass the increased costs along to customers. Effective January 1, 1995, Network A charges will increase to $160.00 for those subscribers in the continental USA that are serviced via the AT&amp;T terrestrial network that Dow Jones manages for the CTA Plan Participants and to existing customers located in Montreal and Toronto; the fee for all other locations in Canada will be based on the cost of delivering the ticker signal to the subscriber. Rates for subscribers located south of Chambers Street in New York City, where facilities are leased from NYNEX, and for customers presently receiving the signal via satellite, remain unchanged. Network B charges will increase to $130.00 per unit, effective January 1, 1995, for all customers presently receiving service in the continental USA and Toronto, Canada, including subscribers in downtown New York City and those currently receiving the ticker signal via satellite; the fee for all other locations in Canada will be based on the cost of delivering the ticker to the subscriber. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Solicitation of Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Rule 11Aa&hyph;3(c)(3) under the Act provides that the proposed amendment may be put into effect upon filing with the Commission. The Commission may summarily abrogate the amendment within 60 days of its filing and require refiling and approval of the amendments by Commission order pursuant to Rule 11Aa3&hyph;2(c) (2), if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors and maintenance of fair and orderly markets, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanisms of a National Market System, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing.

			<p><P> December 5, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EXCLUSION OF BLACK AUTHORS  </P> <P> Mathabane takes to task the Encyclopedia Britannica for not including black  authors among its "Great Books of the Western World."  </P> <P> The reason for this is straightforward.  </P> <P> Black writers have written predominantly about the experience of being black.  That puts them in a category with Philip Roth and Leon Uris, who have written  about the experience of being Jewish, and Betty Friedan who has written about  the experience of being a woman. Roth, Uris and Friedan are also not in the  "Great Books."  </P> <P> Obviously, these are very good writers and authors. But a key criterion for  admission to the "Great Books" series is "universality." And that means  something more than an author writing about his or her own community, however  adroitly.  </P> <P> At its base, then, Mathabane is simply one more voice calling for quotas,  race-based preference and the like.  </P> <P> T.A.

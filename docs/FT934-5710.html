			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Catering deals elude private sector Compulsory competitive tendering of catering has failed to have much impact, with only 6 per cent of contracts put out to tender being awarded to private contractors. A report from the Institute of Public Finance shows that local authority contracts form only 1.4 per cent of the Pounds 2.4bn contract-catering market. No great savings have been made for the public, with a 1.5 per cent increase in expenditure on education and welfare catering since compulsory competitive tendering was introduced. Some counties have raised school-meal charges and others are phasing them out. The catering industry accepts that the Transfer of Undertakings (Public Employees) regulations (Tupe) apply to council catering contracts. This means that employees must be offered jobs on their existing terms and con-ditions, and most con-tractors are tendering on this basis. But the institute said that opportunities for the private sector would increase because of the introduction of local management in schools. It said the high cost of taking over county council school-meals budgets - the average annual contract is Pounds 1.8m - barred most contract caterers. Of the 2,500 UK contract-catering companies, 62 per cent have an annual turnover of less than Pounds 100,000. Eating Out. IPF, Suffolk House, College Road, Croydon CR0 1PF.

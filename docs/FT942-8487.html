			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Nuclear power review given wider scope: The new terms reflect persuasive lobbying Nuclear Electric yesterday finally won its year-long battle to persuade the government that its privatisation should at least be considered. But it could be many years before it and Scottish Nuclear are in the private sector. Many observers believe they will remain state concerns for ever. When the government promised in 1989 to hold a review this year, it was assumed its main focus would be whether to lift the moratorium on building new capacity. Privatisation of nuclear power stations had, after all, just been withdrawn because the City said it would not buy them. The wide-ranging terms of reference announced yesterday appear to put privatisation back on the agenda, if only as a possibility later in the decade. The government's decision to consider it is in part a recognition of the extraordinary strides the industry has made in improving its efficiency. It is also testimony to the persuasive lobbying of Nuclear Electric, which wants to be free of ministerial interference and believes its only real chance of adding to its 11 operating stations is to get money from the private sector rather than a cash-strapped state. The Treasury likes the sound of its arguments. But the Department of Trade and Industry remembers the City's arguments of 1989: that the government would have to underwrite future costs which could arise from regulatory change and from decommissioning nuclear plants. It is also acutely aware of the political damage which could be inflicted on the government during a privatisation debate. Labour might be prepared to reconsider its opposition to building new nuclear power stations later this decade but it will remain implacably opposed to privatisation. The stance of environmentalists will also play a part in government thinking. Ms Bridget Woodman of the pressure group Greenpeace said yesterday her organisation would not oppose a simple privatisation as that might be the best way of ensuring that no more nuclear plants were built. But privatisation of the nuclear generation industry would be anything but simple, as Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, acknowledged yesterday when he said privatisation this side of an election was extremely unlikely. Few analysts believe that a privatisation of Nuclear Electric would be possible without a significant restructuring. Mr John Reynolds, analyst at James Capel, said yesterday the issue of liabilities from the six operating Magnox stations would have to be addressed, either by splitting them from the five advance gas cooled reactor stations and the soon-to-be-commissioned pressurised water reactor, or by agreeing fixed-price contracts with British Nuclear Fuels for reprocessing their fuel. 'Privatisation is possible but it would take a major effort of government will,' he said. But if early privatisation is unlikely, what about Nuclear Electric's plans to build a series of pressurised water reactors on the model provided by its Sizewell B reactor in Suffolk? It has already applied for planning permission to build another there. Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear are likely to argue that it cannot be left to the market, and in this they will play the environmental card. 'The UK will need to invest in new nuclear stations to ensure security and diversity of supply, and to meet its global environmental commitments,' Mr Bob Hawley, chief executive of Nuclear Electric, said yesterday. He said Sizewell C was the 'most cost-effective way of doing that'. Such claims will be attacked during the review by rival generators such as National Power and PowerGen, which are building stations capable of producing electricity at about 2.7p per kilowatt hour at present gas prices. Nuclear Electric says it can produce power at 2.9p per kilowatt hour and that the costs of the raw material - uranium - are less volatile than gas. Even that estimate makes what most people regard as extremely optimistic assumptions on costs of capital and potential load factors. More important, it is considerably higher than the price of electricity in the wholesale trading pool where the average price has been capped at 2.4p for the next two years. There is no guarantee that they will rise significantly above that level later in the decade. Even some industry executives accept that attracting investors to Sizewell C may therefore require some kind of intervention by the government. Although they are not specific, this could come in the form of underwriting liabilities; extending the nuclear levy on consumers beyond its proposed 1998 termination, or guaranteeing a fixed proportion of the power market for the nuclear industry. The Tory government would have to swallow pretty hard to accept any of these ideas, particularly when other energy sources appear to be in such plentiful supply. One possibility is that the government will conclude the review by telling the industry to see if it can attract private-sector funds to build new power stations, leaving a decision on the role the state should play until later in the decade.                          *      *      *  -----------------------------------------------------------------------         UK NUCLEAR INDUSTRY: CLEAN POWER BUT NOT WITHOUT TEARS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- KEY DATES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1945 Government decides to undertake atomic energy programme  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1947 Work begins on Windscale (now Sellafield) for military plutonium and energy programme developments.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1950 First Windscale reactor starts to produce military plutonium.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1955 Construction of fast reactor starts at Dounreay, Scotland  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1956 World's first commercial nuclear power station opens at Calder Hall, Windscale.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1957 Windscale fire.

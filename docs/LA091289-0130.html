			<p><P> September 12, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PAUL GANN DIES; TAX-CRUSADING PROP. 13 AUTHOR  </P> <P> Paul Gann, the tax crusader who achieved nationwide attention as co-author of  Proposition 13 in 1978 died Monday, almost two years after embarking on his  final campaign.  </P> <P> That one was against the AIDS virus, to which he was exposed during a blood  transfusion after open heart surgery in 1982. He died at the Kaiser Permanente  Medical Center in Sacramento, where he had been under treatment for a broken  hip suffered in a Sept. 2 fall at his Carmichael home. He was 77.  </P> <P> A hospital spokesman said Gann died from pneumonia, complicated by his battle  against the AIDS virus.  </P> <P> Gov. George Deukmejian called his fellow Republican "a tireless crusader in  behalf of lower taxes, fiscal responsibility and good government. . . . He was  a champion of the hard-working taxpayer and an outstanding American." And  Democratic Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, whose powers Gann had once campaigned  to curtail, credited the activist with playing "a major role in shaping  California's government financing system for a dozen years. His passing will be  felt."  </P> <P> A longtime friend, Assemblyman Ross Johnson (R-La Habra), described Gann as  "small in physical stature but huge in his impact on California. . . . He was  the will of the common man, ignored by politicians, that rose up to challenge  and defeat the inaction of the Legislature."  </P> <P> On June 9, 1987, in one of the most unusual press conferences in Sacramento  history, Gann, normally a grandfatherly type who spoke softly in homilies,  voiced his outrage over the tainted blood that had been given him.  </P> <P> He told publicly and graphically how the virus that causes acquired immune  deficiency syndrome had crippled him physically, and called for widespread  testing to detect the always-fatal, infectious malady that strikes primarily at  male homosexuals and intravenous drug users.  </P> <P> "Instead of selfishly trying to protect ourselves by keeping secrets, we should  be leading the fight to protect our friends and loved ones. . . ," he told the  media. "We have to face it. There's no cure for AIDS. The only way to control  it now is to find out who has it and let others know."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Teamed With Howard Jarvis  </P> <P> Before launching his battle against AIDS, Gann had been known best for teaming  with the blustery Howard Jarvis in 1977 to qualify the controversial initiative  Proposition 13 for the ballot and for his individual efforts to keep the spirit  of tax cutting alive.  </P> <P> The two became famous by promising homeowners relief from drastically  increasing property taxes. Fearful that the rising taxes would result in the  loss of their homes, voters went to the polls and approved Proposition 13 by a  margin of 2 to 1.  </P> <P> Gann's life had been something of a roller coaster ride before Proposition 13  catapulted him to fame. He came from a poor Arkansas family, suffered from a  crippling disease for much of his early years and was a car and real estate  salesman who twice went bankrupt.  </P> <P> But, riding the tide of fame and glory bestowed on him by thankful taxpayers,  Gann late in his life became the 1980 Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate.  He also made a second career of using the initiative process to deal with what  he said was a state government unresponsive to the voters interests.  </P> <P> Born in Clark County, Ark., on June 12, 1912, Gann was one of 11 children. The  son of a Nazarene preacher who farmed to support the family, Gann early on  learned the Bible passages he was to use often during his campaigns.  </P> <P> At age 5, after his leg was crushed in a fall from a horse, he contracted a  disease he would suffer from for the next 25 years. Osteomyelitis, an  inflammation of the bone marrow, settled in his left leg, at times causing his  knee to swell to the size of a basketball.  </P> <P> "His brothers and sisters had to pull him to grammar school in a wagon," Gann's  daughter Linda Stone said. "He was a cripple."  </P> <P> Gann's illness ultimately prevented him from attending public schools, and he  was tutored at home by his mother. He completed high school through a  correspondence course and later took law courses the same way.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sold Autos, Real Estate  </P> <P> In 1931 Gann married Nell Holloway and made a living picking peaches and doing  construction work. During the Depression, Gann and his wife left Arkansas and  moved to California, where he supported them by selling autos and real estate.  </P> <P> In the early 1940s, still suffering from the osteomyelitis, Gann went to a San  Francisco hospital where he had 13 operations. Nell Gann said doctors resorted  to putting maggots on the infected leg hoping they would eat away the  osteomyelitis. When this failed, Gann's doctor gained permission to try a new  drug, penicillin.  </P> <P> Within months, he was cured.  </P> <P> "He (Gann) said his recovery from osteomyelitis was a miracle, and we gave God  credit for his recovery," Nell Gann said.  </P> <P> Registered as a Democrat, Gann started his political career in the 1950s. By  then he had four children and was earning a living selling cars and real estate  while doing volunteer work in Democratic presidential primaries. He also  mounted an unsuccessful campaign for the City Council in Modesto, where he  lived for 13 years before moving to Sacramento.  </P> <P> His first bankruptcy was the result of investing virtually all his money in  military surplus items for resale after World War II. But, his wife said, the  items did not reach him until after consumer demand was gone.  </P> <P> Gann again filed bankruptcy in 1964 as a result of a long court case in which  Volvo of America Corp. challenged the ownership of a dealership Gann had  purchased.  </P> <P> "I regret those things happened," Nell Gann said, "but I will never hold my  head down because of it." Interviewed before her husband's death, she said he  would often say, "You are never defeated if you get knocked down, it's if you  don't get up."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Switched to Republicans  </P> <P> In the early 1970s Gann changed his party affiliation from Democrat to  Republican to, in his words, "better help the people of California." He took up  those issues he felt affected taxpayers statewide. By now retired, Gann's first  signature drive was in 1974 to demonstrate public opposition to what his  supporters said was a generous pension plan for legislators.  </P> <P> To supply a vehicle for political involvement at the local level, Gann founded  the People's Advocate in 1974. Gann was its president when he teamed up with  Jarvis in 1977.  </P> <P> Jarvis, as president of the United Organization of Taxpayers, and Gann had  tried individually to place property tax-cutting initiatives on the ballot  before 1977. After each had failed, they decided to work together.  </P> <P> Their drastic personality differences made it more productive for them to  handle separate aspects of the Proposition 13 campaign.  </P> <P> Gann and his organization established local committees that rang doorbells and  used telephones to get out the vote. Jarvis handled publicity and coordinated  radio and television coverage.  </P> <P> After their overwhelming ballot victory, Gann, a benign man with a down-home  way of approaching people, noted that he had been overshadowed by the  fast-talking, loud-mouthed Jarvis.  </P> <P> Jarvis, who died in 1986, admitted he was the one most often in the limelight,  adding, "Paul had a right to feel slighted somewhat," but "it didn't cause any  bitterness between us."  </P> <P> Yet, after the success of the initiative, the two had a bitter falling out,  Gann charging that Jarvis was trying to claim all the credit for the success of  Proposition 13. Gann and Jarvis later mended their disagreements and went on to  endorse each other's endeavors.  </P> <P> After Proposition 13, Gann struck out alone on the initiative path. Already in  his late 60s, Gann took a story of over-taxation and legislative overspending  to the people and attracted many to his cause.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Doing What Had to Be Done  </P> <P> In 1979 Gann told The Times he was only doing what had to be done.  </P> <P> "The people shouldn't have to go around with petitions creating laws, but if  the Legislature won't, we will," Gann said.  </P> <P> "I'm a patriot. I care about the people and about my country. I'd fight like a  dog for our rights."  </P> <P> That same year, Gann campaigned for the "Spirit of 13" initiative that placed  constitutional limits on government spending in the state. The initiative,  Proposition 4 on the ballot, was passed by 3-1 majority in the November, 1979,  state election.  </P> <P> Then in 1980, proclaiming the need to balance the federal budget and limit the  power of government, the grass-roots activist defeated six other Republican  challengers to become the party's candidate for the U.S. Senate.  </P> <P> Running against then two-term incumbent Alan Cranston, Gann was pegged as a  one-issue candidate with little knowledge of anything but tax-cutting  initiatives.  </P> <P> Gann spent just over $1 million during the campaign, compared to the nearly $3  million Cranston spent, a spokesman for the Federal Election Commission said.  But, more important, in the crucial days before the election Gann ran  completely out of funds and had to depend on radio and television talk shows  for publicity.  </P> <P> Cranston easily won the race with 56.5% of the votes compared to Gann's 37%.  </P> <P> After the election Gann immediately went back to tackling what he viewed as  government inadequacies with his Victims Bill of Rights initiative, Proposition  8 on the June, 1982, ballot.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tide of Public Sentiment  </P> <P> Riding a tide of public sentiment that held that lawmakers were soft on crime  and that the courts coddled criminals, Proposition 8 amended the state  Constitution to make criminal convictions easier, adding five sections to the  Penal Code and three sections to the Health and Institution Code. The  initiative was approved by 56% of the voters.  </P> <P> Then again using the power of direct democracy, Gann challenged lawmakers with  his Legislative Reform Act in 1983.  </P> <P> This initiative, which qualified for the June, 1984, ballot, called for a  drastic 30% cut in the Legislature's budget and reduction of the power held by  the Assembly Speaker. It was approved by the voters but thrown out by the  courts.  </P> <P> Gann campaigned for all his propositions with the vigor of men half his age.  Even the five-bypass open heart operation in 1982 that was to result in his  exposure to the AIDS virus, and intestinal surgery for blocked arteries in  November, 1983, failed to slow him appreciably.  </P> <P> In June, 1987, he proposed legislation that would eliminate some of the  property tax inequities created by his own Proposition 13. But thereafter he  lost those scrapping abilities as AIDS weakened him. When he first disclosed  that he was infected by the virus, he said he at first lost 10 pounds in as  many days and could not eat or stand properly.  </P> <P> But, for a time, he improved, attributing what proved only to be a brief  recovery to his getting over "the anger and frustration."  </P> <P> "Hey, I was born to die. I'm going to die someday," he said at that fateful  press conference.  </P> <P> "But I'm going to tell you one thing. (I'm) going to put up an awful fight  because I'm going to hang on and fight back, and I will be doing what I've been  doing for years until the day I can no longer get out of bed and move around  and call people."  </P></p>

The visit is expected  to include the signing of six agreements which will determine  the further development of Uzbek-Indian relations, in particular  in the commercial and economic spheres.    Karimov is expected to hold talks with Indian Prime Minister  Narasimha Rao which will touch upon a wide range of bilateral  and international questions. The Uzbek leader is also scheduled  to give a speech at a meeting of the Confederation of Indian  Industry.    As the "NATIONAL HERALD", a paper known to be close to  Indian  government circles, pointed out, "Uzbekistan desires to  cooperate with India in the industrial and trade sectors in  order to stimulate its privatisation process and the transition  to a free market economy". Therefore the Uzbek delegation  includes the heads of recently privatised key enterprises in the  Middle Asian republic, according to the paper.    In its turn, India is ready to offer wholehearted help to  the  friendly ex-Soviet republic during this difficult transitional  period of economic restructuring, the "NATIONAL HERALD" declared.</p>

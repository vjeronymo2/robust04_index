			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / Jordan defuses US rift King Hussein of Jordan has defused a serious rift with the US over sanctions-busting by tightening customs checks along his kingdom's border with Iraq, officials and diplomats said, Reuter reports from Amman. The clampdown, some say, may even encourage Washington to resume military aid frozen because of Jordanian sympathy for Iraq during the Gulf crisis. Jordan has been Baghdad's main supply line since the UN Security Council slapped on a trade blockade after Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990.</p>

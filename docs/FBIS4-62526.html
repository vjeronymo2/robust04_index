			<p>BFN     [Text] The Georgian leader, Eduard Shevardnadze, has  described the agreement to cease-fire and disengage the Georgian  and Abkhazian units reached in Moscow on Saturday [14 May] as  "genuine foundations for the return of refugees to Abkhazia."    In his traditional interview for Georgian radio given on  Mondays Shevardnadze noted that the process of deploying  peacekeeping forces in the conflict area "will not be long." A  plan for deploying disengagement forces will be worked out soon,  he said. According to Shevardnadze, Russia is playing a  particularly active role in this work. The U.N. Security  Council and the CIS Collective Security Council will consider  the plan in the near future. "I think that we'll get support in  both organizations," Shevardnadze said.    With reference to the work of the country's parliament the  Georgian leader said that different political forces call for  early parliamentary elections. They include the opposition and  the party he leads -- the Union of Georgian Citizens, he said.  "This issue remains open," Shevardnadze said. "My own stand  will depend largely on how constructive the parliament's work  will be."    The Georgian leader expressed solidarity with the demands of  "some sections of society, particularly intellectuals," for  strengthening the country's executive authorities.    With reference to the visit to Tbilisi by President Geydar  Aliyev of Azerbaijan expected this week, Shevardnadze said that  their discussions will focus on the situation in the Caucasus.  "A dialogue on the situation in the Caucasus must be constant  between the leaders of Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Russia,"  he pointed out.</p>

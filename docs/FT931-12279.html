			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / World Trade News: Oman tank deal may be worth Pounds 150m MR JOHN MAJOR, the British prime minister, yesterday confirmed that Oman had agreed to buy Challenger 2 tanks from Vickers of the UK. The purchase, expected to be worth about Pounds 150m including spares and training, is the first export order for the new British tank in a fiercely competitive world market. It follows British contracts from Oman for Hawk jet aircraft and two missile-carrying corvettes. Mr Major, on a stop-over on his return from India, made the announcement in Muscat after talks with Sultan Qaboos bin Said, Oman's ruler. The initial contract will involve 18 tanks and four armoured repair and recovery vehicles and is expected to be followed by another order for 20-30 tanks. Vickers already provides support services for Oman's fleet of UK-made Chieftain tanks. Mr Major said the sale would sustain employment at Vickers' tank factories in Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne, which each employ about 800 people. Vickers is depending on export business to keep both production lines in operation after the UK government's decision in 1991 to buy only 140 of the new Challenger 2s. The Omani deal follows a big setback to Vickers' export hopes last October, when Kuwait opted to buy 236 M1A2 Abrams tanks, made by General Dynamics of the US, in preference to the Challenger 2. Thomson-CSF, the French defence electronics group, and Short Brothers, the Belfast aerospace company owned by Bombardier of Canada, both refused comment yesterday on speculation about an imminent link-up in the missile business. However, they said discussions were continuing on jointly developing a successor to Shorts' Starstreak missile.</p>

			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Traditional society maintained up north - The proposed merger between Northern Rock and North of England In a different world, the members of North of England Building Society's board might have a case to answer under the 'best advice' provisions of the Financial Services Act. They are apparently advising the society's 230,000 members to abandon its independence for less than a tenth of its value. The expected offer of up to 1 per cent of retail balances, making perhaps an average of Pounds 50 per member, does not seem a good deal compared with the average Pounds 650 if the society was sold for Pounds 150m. This is the estimate of North of England's value made by UBS, the securities house. The fact that such calculations are now made is a measure of the disruption caused to the process of society mergers by Lloyds Bank's Pounds 1.8bn bid for Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society. Until the proposed merger of North of England with Northern Rock was disclosed yesterday, many advisers said Lloyds' bid could put off such moves. 'Anyone who reads a newspaper knows that there are now alternatives to a merger bonus,' said Mr Rupert Robson, an assistant director of Schroders. According to a very crude calculation, based on Lloyds' paying up to 2.1 times the net assets of C&amp;G, the value of societies can now be determined by doubling their general reserves. This method would, for example, value Nationwide at about Pounds 3bn. Yet it now seems that, providing North of England members accept the board's advice, the likely pattern of restructuring in retail financial services will have to be recalculated yet again. The development is likely to add more uncertainty to what is becoming an extremely jittery market. Mr John Wriglesworth, UBS societies analyst, argues that North of England members are likely to accept the offer. 'The inertia, apathy, lack of awareness and even idiocy among ordinary members means that when the first fuss dies down, they are going to vote for this,' he said. Indeed, Mr Wriglesworth believes they should do so. North of England members will not give up membership rights in the transfer but will instead join the merged society. They will thus retain the right to a possibly larger bonus should the enlarged Northern Rock convert, or be acquired. Mr Wriglesworth is among supporters of mutual ownership who believe that societies have a useful role. Yet he accepts it is a growing struggle to convince everyone of this. 'If you accept that members want money, and their boards should act accordingly, all societies should sell up.' Some merchant bankers who advise societies think the market dynamics have been changed by the Lloyds bid. Since they are responsible to employees, depositors and borrowers rather than just shareholders, boards have until now felt happy to rebuff offers from banks and others without consulting members. Yet these boards may now feel more exposed to the risk of such outsiders publicising the terms of such offers if they are rejected. 'I don't think we will see hostile bids for societies, but a lot of pressure can be put on a society's board without open hostility,' said one adviser. This change of attitude, combined with the renewed interest among banks, means that some boards may be tempted to change. 'Some may feel they will get a better deal by choosing a partner now than by waiting to see what happens,' said Mr Charles Irby, a director of Baring Brothers. Ailing societies which would until now have been herded by the Building Societies Commission towards being taken over by another society may now find it harder. At least one small society which was about to merge is thought to have shelved the plans because of nervousness about its members' reaction. Yet some advisers believe that mergers will continue even if there is a hiatus. 'Boards may think long and hard now that appetites have been whetted, but mergers are well-established and there is still a need for the industry to consolidate,' said Mr Richard Davey, a director of NM Rothschild. Furthermore, some analysts say that there is a good case for societies to be preserved on competitive grounds. Mr Davey argues that societies can offer better savings and mortgage rates to members because they do not have to bear the cost of servicing equity through dividends to shareholders. Mr Wriglesworth says that the benefit of not having to pay dividends might in the past have been absorbed by 'management slackness'. However, societies now face pressures, such as analysis by ratings agencies, which ensure that they operate efficiently enough to pass on such benefits in pricing. Yet this argument for the existence of a building societies industry to offer competition to banks may not persuade many members that they should reject cash offers for their own. The reaction of the North of England shareholders will provide an indication of how far attitudes have changed.  --------------------------------------------------------------- How building societies stack up  --------------------------------------------------------------- Dec 31 1993                            General reserves       Assets                               Pounds m          Pounds bn  --------------------------------------------------------------- Halifax*                       3,649               67.16 Nationwide**                   1,522               35.00 Woolwich                       1,243               25.23 Alliance &amp; Leicester           1,023               21.09 Leeds Permanent***               982               19.49 Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester          864               17.69 Bradford &amp; Bingley               633               13.86 Britannia                        446               12.91 National &amp; Provincial            647               12.72 Bristol &amp; West                   284                8.14 NOrthern Rock                    313                7.28 Yorkshire                        313                5.35 Birmingham Midshires             182                4.33 Portman                          156                3.06 Coventry                         143                2.97 Skipton                          106                2.91 Leeds &amp; Holbeck                  100                2.45 Chelsea                          110                2.21 Derbyshire                       102                1.65 North of England                  82                1.51  --------------------------------------------------------------- Year-end  * Jan 1994  ** April 1993  *** Sept 1993 Source: UBS  ---------------------------------------------------------------  --------------------------------------------------------------- Northern Rock vs North of England  --------------------------------------------------------------- 1993                       Northern Rock     North of England                              (Pounds m)         (Pounds m)  --------------------------------------------------------------- Pre-tax profit                  89.3                13.5 Net profit                      60.3                 9.1 Mortgage balances            6,040.0             1,174.0 Tier 1 solvency ratio          8.54%              13.51% Management expenses /  total income ratio           34.96%              54.05% Number of branches               134                  42 Number of shareholders       960,000             229,673 Number of borrowers          360,000              42,836 Number of depositers          21,102              28,348  ---------------------------------------------------------------</p>

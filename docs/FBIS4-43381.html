			<p>BFN     [Text] The cease-fire agreement for Rwanda was formally  announced a moment ago during the closing ceremony of the OAU  summit in Tunis. The agreement envisions dialogue and  negotiation as the means to settle the conflict between the  [Rwandan] Patriotic Front and the interim government. It should  have taken effect immediately yesterday evening, but it appears  that the fighting is continuing in Kigali.    Paris has taken note of this latest cease-fire agreement and  expressed satisfaction with it, but the French Government  condemned the massacre which took place in a church in the  Rwandan capital, Kigali, which is reported to have resulted in  30-40 deaths, according to the United Nations.</p>

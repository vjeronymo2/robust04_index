			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / The Barcelona Olympics: Why women got a raw deal - The weaknesses of female sports people It is not dance. It is not acrobatics. Nor is it a juvenile fashion show. It is something of all three. It is women's rhythmic gymnastics, and as the crowd's applause indicated yesterday in preliminary Olympic competition, it is a delight to watch. These are girls as young as 13, yet they have more grace that most of us will learn in a lifetime. There is also an astonishing mastery of physical skills. Some of the contestants move with lithe sensuality; others like modern jazz dancers. All have the ability to make ordinary objects and movements riveting. I saw Celine Degrange of France transform an ordinary skipping rope into a living thing: it flew through the air with a will of its own, wound around her body like a snake, writhed and circled at her feet. I am fascinated by female gymnasts' youthful energy and character, but their bodies are a mystery. All-female gymnastic competitions are nominally women's events, but nowhere are women to be seen. Here are girls who begin a rigorous training programme at six and reach their peak at an average age of 16. Yet even in the most difficult exercises on bars and beams, in vaulting and on the floor, their dynamism and speed often exceed that of male gymnasts in their mid-20s. These days, top female gymnasts in their mid-20s are unheard of. In recent years women's gymnastic techniques have altered radically, coming to resemble men's much more, and the age of competitors has plummeted. In gymnastics, it seems, the more a woman is shaped like a man the better she is at performing athletic tasks. Could Nature, I wondered, have dealt a low hand to women in other physical skills? The answer is generally yes. Consider women's legs. They do not, like men's legs, run parallel from the hips. Instead, because women have spacious childbearing hips, their legs are set wider apart and run at a pronounced angle down towards the knees. Consequently, most women tend to splay out their heels when they run. Not only does this make them less efficient runners, but such an articulation pushes the kneecap outwards, causing its underside to rub against the femur below - often the cause of pain and injury. But a woman's legs are just the beginning of Nature's conspiracy to put her at a sporting disadvantage against men. Throughout the world men are on average 7 per cent taller than women. Men have wider shoulders, longer and more muscles in the back and chest, and greater strength in the thorax. Men have longer arms than women, which gives them greater bio-mechanical leverage and greater ability to project objects at velocity in ball and racket sports. The amount of a woman's body weight given to fat puts them at a considerable disadvantage in many sports. Perhaps the greatest difference between men and women's sporting abilities lies in their cardio-vascular systems. Relative to their body size women have smaller hearts than men and less pumping capacity. Women carry about a litre less blood than males, and that blood has fewer oxygen-carrying red cells and less haemoglobin. Women's lungs are about 10 per cent smaller than men's. Together, differences in heart, blood and lungs make women's oxygen utilisation only 75 per cent that of men's. The good Lord, however, has not made men's relative advantages an entirely one-sided affair. Women's bodies function in cold better because of their additional body fat. Because they sweat less they adapt better to heat and aridity. They have greater resistance to cold water and float better; eight out of the 10 fastest English channel swimmers are female. Women also have greater physical flexibility, a better sense of balance, a higher pain threshold and greater manual dexterity. However, generalisations are dangerous. Myths of masculine physical superiority and female weaknesses are disproved every day. Try it for yourself. Step out on to the gymnastics floor and achieve just a fraction of the grace and finesse of those small, young people trailing satin ribbons behind them. Hats off to the man who can do it.</p>

			<p>931102 FT  02 NOV 93 / Austrian Airlines strike off Austrian Airlines flight crew have called off their four-day-old strike with immediate effect, supervisory board head Rudolf Streicher said last night after mediation talks with union leaders. The decision to end the strike, called last Friday to protest against management job cut plans, requires the approval of a meeting of the AUA's 1,200 flight crew. But their leader, Mr Albin Schwarz, said he was confident the decision to go back to work would be endorsed.</p>

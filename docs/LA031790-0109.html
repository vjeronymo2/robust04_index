			<p><P> March 17, 1990, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CONGRESS HEARS CITIES' PLIGHT OVER  BILLBOARDS  </P> <P> Agoura Hills Councilwoman Fran Pavley, reflecting on her city's futile  eight-year fight to remove 30 billboards along the Ventura Freeway, told a  House subcommittee in Washington Thursday that local governments should be  given the clout to banish roadside signs.  </P> <P> Pavley testified before a subcommittee of the House Public Works Committee that  the key impediment under current federal law is a requirement that localities  compensate billboard companies.  </P> <P> Local governments must reimburse the owner for the sign's value as well as for  the revenues that would be lost by dismantling it. This has allowed the firms  to set their own price, which can be as much as $100,000, Pavely said.  </P></p>

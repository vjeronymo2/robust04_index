			<p><P> September 18, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Five South Americans arrested in Canada last week were planning to help two  accused Colombian drug smugglers break out of jail in Fredericton, New  Brunswick, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Inspector Al  Hutchinson said the men will appear in court early this week to be charged.  Four of the men were seized Wednesday in the Atlantic province, along with an  arsenal of weapons. The fifth was caught Thursday in Saint John, New Brunswick.  Hutchinson said the men were trying to free two Colombians who were arrested in  April after police seized 1,100 pounds of cocaine stashed in a small airplane  that crash-landed at a private airstrip near Fredericton.  </P></p>

			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / International Company News: Bank Austria wins GiroCredit Bank Austria, the country's largest bank, has won the battle for control of GiroCredit, the country's third largest bank, banking sources in Vienna said last night. The takeover, which was due to be announced next week, will help reduce competition in Austria's financial sector and lift Bank Austria's relatively weak presence in the domestic capital markets. The outcome followed the threat on Monday by GiroCredit's four executive directors to resign when their contracts expire at the end of June. The executives said that they had acted out of frustration with the stalemate over strategy on the bank's supervisory board. GiroCredit is owned by Austria's savings banks, which use it as a central clearing organisation. The two largest savings banks groups, Bank Austria and First Austrian, with 30 per cent and 20 per cent stakes respectively, have resented GiroCredit's competition against them. To break the stalemate, First Austrian proposed last spring the formation of a consortium of savings banks to buy out Bank Austria. But it faced considerable difficulty convincing the savings banks of the merit of its proposal. On March 1, Bank Austria, frustrated with the delay, launched a bid for 20.4 per cent of GiroCredit at Sch370 per share. Last weekend, at a meeting of five large provincial savings banks, it became clear that only one would reject the Bank Austria proposal. Bank Austria has since sweetened its offer, and is offering Sch400 per share for all GiroCredit shares tendered. It is offering to sell some of its own branches to savings banks to help them in their local markets.</p>

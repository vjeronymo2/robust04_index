			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / S&amp;P rate on Visa credit card undercuts rivals SAVE &amp; PROSPER, the investment group, has launched a Visa card that threatens to shake up the credit card market by charging a rate of interest at least 7 percentage points less than most others. Issuers of credit cards and store cards have come under increasing criticism this year for charging rates often well in excess of 20 per cent when base rates are 6 per cent. Issuers argue that the rate charged has to cover the cost of processing payments, risk and fraud. The rate of interest on Save &amp; Prosper's card is 1 per cent a month, an annualised percentage rate (APR) of 14.6 per cent. That compares with a 22.9 per cent APR at Barclaycard, the largest issuer with 8.8m cards in issue, and a 23.9 per cent APR at National Westminster bank, which has 4m cards. Mr Ian Lindsey, the S&amp;P director responsible for banking services, said: 'We believe that the high street banks are overcharging their credit card customers in order to compensate for the losses they are making on personal current accounts.' He denied that the S&amp;P rate had been pitched low to attract new customers, and would be increased later. S&amp;P has 100,000 cards in issue but hopes to double its market share. It is raising its annual fee from Pounds 10 to Pounds 12 and, like the main issuers, will charge interest from the transaction date rather than the statement date for those who do not settle monthly bills in full. The big issuers said yesterday that they would not be bringing down their rates in response to S&amp;P's move. Barclaycard said it remained to be seen whether the move was more than a marketing gimmick. It said its own card offered a wider range of benefits and it believed S&amp;P's rate would be difficult for a mass-market operator to sustain. National Westminster said it doubted that S&amp;P would make much money if it attracted customers who borrowed heavily. The Consumers' Association said the launch of the new card was 'a significant move'.</p>

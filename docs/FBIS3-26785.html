Speaking at a Security Council meeting on the situation in  Bosnia, Chen Jian, China's deputy representative to the United  Nations, said that the international community should "act very  prudently and refrain from taking any hasty action."    He said that at a time when the peace process for Bosnia was  at a crucial juncture, taking further military actions would by  no means help achieve political solution.    "On the contrary," he said, "it will only entail negative  consequences."    With regard to the use of air power in that country, Chen  said, China believed it should be limited to the self-defense by  the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in the former Yugoslav  republic.    As for the possible serious consequences of the use of air  strikes on the safety of UNPROFOR personnel and the humanitarian  relief activities in the Balkan country, Chen said that "we  cannot but express anxiety and concern."    The eventual settlement of the Bosnian crisis, Chen said,  should continue to be sought within the framework of the  principles set forth by the international conference on the  former Yugoslavia and relevant Security Council resolutions and  through peaceful negotiations so as to ensure a lasting, fair  and reasonable solution that could guarantee the fundamental  interests of various parties and could be accepted by all.    "The parties concerned in Bosnia and Herzegovina have  recently held several rounds of talks," Chen said, and "we hope  all the endeavors of the international community will genuinely  help promote the peace process towards the political settlement."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Gennadiy Bocharov] </F>   [Text] Moscow March 18 TASS -- The reason for the crash of  an Iranian C-130 military aircraft whose debris were found this  morning near Stepanakert, Nagorno-Karabakh, is cockpit  depressurization, well-informed sources told ITAR-TASS today.    Judging by radio talks of the crew and the air traffic  controllers, a possibility of the plane's shot down in the  Karabakh skies is minimum.    The C-130 plane, an analogue of the U.S. Hercules or the  Russian AN-12, belongs to the Iranian Defence Ministry. It came  to Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport several days ago to bring 52  Iranian servicemen studying in Moscow. On Wednesday [16 March]  the plane was expected to leave for Tehran, but the take off was  delayed till Thursday night.    The plane finally took off at 18:40 on March 17 carrying 32  passengers, including 19 family members of staffers of the  Iranian Embassy in Moscow, and 13 crew members, and headed for  Tehran.    However, flying at a height of 6,300 meters at 19:54 the  crew  commander got in touch with the Petrovskoye separate homing  radio station and said the plane's cockpit had turned  depressurized and they are losing height. Some time later he  reported that their height is 5,100 meters.    The crew commander had an impression that the situation  improved and climbed the height of 6,300 meters again. At that  time an Aeroflot plane was flying in the opposite direction on  its way from Iran.    The Iranian plane commander informed the Russian colleague  he  had a permission to cross the Russian and Armenian state  borders. The conversation registered in the area of the Dzhulfe  populated locality was the last. After that the Iranian  military plane lost contact with the air traffic controllers and  the flying aircraft.    Smoking debris of the Iranian plane and 32 dead bodies were  found early this morning four kilometers away from Stepanakert.    The Iranian side has requested assistance in the air crash  investigation from the Sheremetyevo international services and  asked local bodies not to touch the debris.</p>

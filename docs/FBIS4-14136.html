			<p>BFN     [Text] The Central Bureau of Investigation [CBI] has found  evidence that arms training was imparted in a neighboring  country to some of the accused in last year's Bombay blasts. A  CBI spokesman said that two people have been arrested in this  connection. The bureau is said to have gathered more material  against the prime accused in this case. It is alleged that the  two arrested were sent abroad for training in handling  explosives by another accused who is absconding. The CBI is  reported to have made the breakthrough while checking the  records of the regional passport office.</p>

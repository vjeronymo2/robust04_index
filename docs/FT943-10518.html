			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Ransomes shares rise 12p on sharp advance Shares in Ransomes rose 12p to 42p yesterday as strong US sales helped the manufacturer of grass-cutting equipment and specialist industrial trucks lift pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.21m to Pounds 6.71m in the half year ended July 2. Turnover rose by 14 per cent to Pounds 102m (Pounds 89.7m). Ransomes also announced the departure of Mr Geoffrey Comer, the financial director. The company has undergone extensive management changes since the arrival of Mr John Clement as chairman in October 1993. There is no ordinary interim dividend although the company will pay its April 1994 convertible preference dividend at the end of October. Steinhardt Partners, a US hedge fund manager which holds 30 per cent of Ransomes' preference shares, almost gained 15 per cent of votes in Ransomes earlier this year because of preference dividend payment arrears. Preference shareholders become enfranchised if arrears are not paid within six months of their due date. The company has reduced its net borrowings to Pounds 72.5m (Pounds 85m)leaving it with gearing of 400 per cent. Earnings per share emerged at 4.5p against losses of 4.4p. The boost in turnover came primarily from north America where sales rose from Pounds 34m to Pounds 43m. Total operating profits more than doubled from Pounds 5.4m to Pounds 11m, the largest contribution coming from the commercial sector with profits of Pounds 7.7m (Pounds 2.4m) on turnover of Pounds 68.1m (Pounds 56.5m). Lossmaking operations in France and Germany returned to profit. Mr Clement said the company had 'exercised tighter control over cash with stocks and borrowings significantly improved'. Existing stock had been reduced from Pounds 51.9m to Pounds 42.4m while more machines were being sold straight off the production line. He said a top tier of 'expensive management' had been removed and the workforce worldwide had been cut by 12 per cent. No new staff had been recruited and sales per employee had increased from Pounds 45,000 to Pounds 59,000. Operating margins improved to 10.8 per cent (6 per cent) . Mr Peter Wilson, chief executive, said the order book looked promising and future sales would be boosted by new products. The company's aim was to increase its penetration of the US fairways market where it had only 5-8 per cent of market share. Mr Clement said the debt burden would be reduced partly by the sale of surplus land. Ransomes has 150 acres available for disposal, valued at Pounds 27.6m. In the balance sheet the company has reclassified surplus land and buildings in current assets as property for disposal.</p>

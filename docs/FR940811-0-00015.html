			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FAA acknowledges that the functional tests specified in paragraph (e) of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AD and CMR items are similar in terms of scheduled maintenance and recordkeeping.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, this AD addresses an unsafe condition and requires installation of the synch-lock to correct that unsafe condition. The FAA has determined that the requirement for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> functional tests is necessary in order to ensure the effectiveness of that installation in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addressing that unsafe condition. As discussed in the preamble of the proposal, this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination is based on the fact that the synch-lock is a new design whose reliability has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not been adequately proven through service experience. In addition, service experience to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> date has demonstrated that failures can occur within the synch-lock that may not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evident during normal operation of the thrust reverser system and may not result in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activation of the synch-lock ``unlock'' indicator. The FAA notes that the ATA's suggested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative to accomplishment of the functional tests would permit each operator to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine whether and how often these tests should be conducted. In light of the severity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the unsafe condition, however, the FAA has determined that allowing this degree of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operator discretion is not appropriate at this time. Therefore, this AD is necessary to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensure that operators accomplish tests of the integrity of the synch-lock installation in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> common manner and at common intervals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ATA also requests that the proposed interval of 1,000 hours time-in-service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for accomplishment of the repetitive functional tests specified in paragraph (e) of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal be extended to 1,500 hours time-in-service. The ATA explains that Boeing has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommended an interval of 4,000 hours time-in-service for inclusion in the next  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Maintenance Review Board (MRB) report. If the FAA denies an extension of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed interval, the ATA requests that the FAA explain why its analysis is so stringent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in comparison with Boeing's recommendation. The ATA believes that AD compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> times should be consistent with operators' regularly scheduled maintenance unless a risk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis requires otherwise. The ATA reasons that compliance times that are inconsistent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with scheduled maintenance holds force operators to reschedule maintenance actions at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considerable expense and disruption to their operations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has reconsidered the proposed interval of 1,000 hours time-in-service for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accomplishment of the initial and repetitive functional tests required by paragraph (e) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this AD. The FAA recognizes that an initial and repetitive interval of 4,000 hours time-in-service for accomplishment of these functional tests, as recommended by Boeing,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> corresponds more closely to the interval at which most of the affected operators conduct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regularly scheduled ``C'' checks. In light of the safety implications of the addressed unsafe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> condition and the practical aspects of accomplishing orderly functional tests of the fleet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during regularly scheduled maintenance where special equipment and trained maintenance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> personnel will be readily available, the FAA finds that accomplishment of the tests at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intervals of 4,000 hours time-in-service will provide an acceptable level of safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (e) of the final rule has been revised accordingly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ATA also requests that the cost of parts be included in the economic impact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information, below, in order to present a total cost impact of the rule on the ``U.S. public.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ATA recognizes that Boeing plans to supply parts at no cost to operators; however,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the ATA suspects the parts costs borne by Boeing would be substantial. The FAA does  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not concur with the commenter's request. The total cost impact figures shown in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> economic impact information, below, represent the costs for time necessary to perform the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspections, adjustments, tests, and modification required by this AD. The cost analysis in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AD rulemaking actions typically does not include parts costs when those parts are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided by the manufacturer at no cost to operators. Such costs are not attributable to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the AD; the manufacturer would incur these costs even if no AD were issued.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has revised paragraph (d) of the final rule to specify that the correct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reference for Boeing Service Bulletin 767&hyph;78&hyph;0061 is Revision 1, rather than Revision 2,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as cited in the proposal. The issue date of Revision 1 (August 5, 1993) appeared correctly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA also has revised paragraphs (a) and (b) of the final rule to clarify the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate compliance time. Those paragraphs restate requirements for accomplishment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of certain actions required by AD 92&hyph;03&hyph;03. The FAA's intent is that the tests,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspections, and adjustments required by those paragraphs would have been accomplished  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within 60 days after January 27, 1992 (the effective date of AD 92&hyph;03&hyph;03).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the changes previously described. The FAA has determined that these changes will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are approximately 119 Model 767 series airplanes equipped with General  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Electric CF6&hyph;80A series engines of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimates that 69 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD. The inspections,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustments, and functional tests required currently by AD 92&hyph;03&hyph;03 require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approximately 16 work hours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, at an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those actions on U.S. operators of Model 767 series airplanes equipped with General  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Electric CF6&hyph;80A series engines is estimated to be $60,720, or $880 per airplane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For U.S. operators of Model 767 series airplanes equipped with General Electric  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CF6&hyph;80A series engines, the FAA estimates that it will take approximately 786 work hours  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> per airplane to accomplish the modification required by this AD, and 1 work hour to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accomplish the required functional tests, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Required parts will be supplied by the manufacturer at no cost to operators. Based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these figures, the total cost impact of those actions on U.S. operators of Model 767 series  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> airplanes equipped with General Electric CF6&hyph;80A series engines is estimated to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $2,986,665, or $43,285 per airplane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are approximately 95 Model 767 series airplanes equipped with Pratt &amp;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Whitney JT9D&hyph;7R4 series engines of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimates that 30 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD. The inspections,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustments, and functional tests required currently by AD 92&hyph;03&hyph;03 require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approximately 16 work hours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, at an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those actions on U.S. operators of Model 767 series airplanes equipped with Pratt &amp;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Whitney JT9D&hyph;7R4 series engines is estimated to be $26,400, or $880 per airplane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For U.S. operators of Model 767 series airplanes equipped with Pratt &amp; Whitney  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> JT9D&hyph;7R4 series engines, the FAA estimates that it will take approximately 812 work  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hours per airplane to accomplish the modification required by this AD, and 1 work hour to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accomplish the required functional tests, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Required parts will be supplied by the manufacturer at no cost to operators. Based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these figures, the total cost impact of those actions on U.S. operators of Model 767 series  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> airplanes equipped with Pratt &amp; Whitney JT9D&hyph;7R4 series engines is estimated to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $1,341,450, or $44,715 per airplane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The number of required work hours for accomplishing the required functional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tests, as indicated above, is presented as if the accomplishment of those tests required by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this AD were to be conducted as ``stand alone'' actions. However, in actual practice, those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tests for the most part will be accomplished coincidentally or in combination with normally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scheduled airplane inspections and other maintenance program tasks. Therefore, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actual number of necessary additional work hours for accomplishment of the functional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tests will be minimal in many instances. Additionally, any costs associated with special  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> airplane scheduling will be minimal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA recognizes that the required modification will require a large number of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> work hours to accomplish. However, the 5-year compliance time specified in paragraph  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) of this AD should allow ample time for the synch-lock installation to be accomplished  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coincidentally with scheduled major airplane inspection and maintenance activities, thereby  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimizing the costs associated with special airplane scheduling.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

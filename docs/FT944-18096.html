			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Decision needed on companies agency Sir, The Department of Trade and Industry announced in July 1992 that there was to be a full review of Companies House which could lead to full or partial privatisation of the Cardiff-based registry. The review commenced in earnest in October 1992 when consultants were appointed to examine its operation and role. Since then, the DTI has considered various recommendations, decided against full privatisation and now, two years on, awaits further recommendation from the consultants on the appropriateness of contracting out most of the work of Companies House ('Companies House plans attacked', October 4). It is to the credit of the management and staff of the agency that they have continued to maintain an admirable quality of service throughout an unreasonably long period of uncertainty. I have been among the critics of some of the activities of Companies House following its creation as one of the 'Next Steps' agencies in 1988, but none of my criticisms has related to the quality of service, which has improved beyond reasonable expectations over the past six years. The companies registry is now viewed quite rightly as among the most efficient in the world today and is the envy of many jurisdictions. It has to be questioned whether contracting out most of the work of Companies House will lead to further improvements in efficiency or better value for money. The management and staff of the agency have a wealth of experience and the ability continuously to improve the service they provide to the business community, both in ensuring company law compliance and distributing publicly available information. The annual report and accounts of Companies House, which won the Price Waterhouse award for the best agency report, highlights what has been achieved and gives a clear impression of the high quality of this organisation. I do hope the period of uncertainty ends soon and the DTI makes a decision based on what is best for users of Companies House. My own view is fairly clear. Michael Whitwell, chief executive, Jordan &amp; Sons, 21 St Thomas Street, Bristol BS1 6JS</p>

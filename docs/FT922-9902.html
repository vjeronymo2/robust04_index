			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / Power chief sees threat to coal sell-off PLANS TO privatise British Coal could founder if the electricity market is not urgently reformed, according to Mr John Baker, chief executive of National Power, the generator. He called on Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, to intervene, and said the electricity pool, or wholesale market, could collapse because of the many gas-fired power stations being built. His warning, which comes as National Power and its rival generator PowerGen prepare to meet Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, is a sign that National Power is seeking to ensure a future for its coal-fired power stations, which must compete with the independent gas stations. Mr Eggar is expected to press for an agreement on the amount and price of coal sold by British Coal to the generators. British Coal cannot be privatised until it signs contracts with the generators because it relies on them for most of its revenue. Mr Baker said the generators could not agree to buy coal unless they could sell the coal-fired power on to regional electricity companies. This now looks increasingly unlikely because National Grid, which owns and operates the electricity network, has warned that England and Wales will have 60 per cent too much electricity by 1997. The prospect of that surplus is forcing generators to jostle for long-term contracts to sell their power to customers. But Mr Baker said the market was not 'an even playing field'. Many of the new gas stations had equity links with regional electricity companies which had also signed contracts to take their output. That could leave National Power and PowerGen short of contracts, even if their stations produced cheaper power. They would have to sell their power into the pool, where the surplus could force prices close to zero. The gas stations could make 45m tonnes of British Coal's output redundant by the end of the decade, Mr Baker said. 'Why aren't the regional companies talking to us?' he asked. 'Why have all 12 signed long-term contracts without testing the market?' Mr Baker said the regulator should act quickly to check whether the regional companies were breaking the rule that compels them to buy the most economic power for their customers. 'I would like to see the regulator make a decision before we sign the contracts with British Coal  - if only a statement of intent,' he said. 'If the regulator said the regional companies could do exactly as they liked, then by definition we would have less confidence about signing long-term coal contracts.' He said the regional companies should be required to invite tenders from generators. But several regional electricity companies said they had had no offers of long-term contracts to buy coal-fired electricity from National Power. 'We would take a good coal offer,' one said, 'but that offer has not been made.' The regional companies also pointed out that the rules allowed them to meet only up to 15 per cent of their demand from the new gas-fired stations, and most had not even signed up that much power. But the chief executive of one regional company said there were legitimate fears that some companies had agreed to buy uncompetitive power from the new stations. And they might pass this higher cost on to consumers unless Offer, the electricity watchdog, decided to penalise regional companies for uneconomic purchasing. Offer shows no signs of responding quickly. It said it would start work on reviewing the issue later this year.</p>

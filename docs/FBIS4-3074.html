			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 15 Apr (XINHUA) -- Tian Ye, deputy  director of the General Office of the Foreign Affairs Bureau of  the People's Bank of China; and Xi Yang, a Hong Kong MING PAO  reporter, were today respectively sentenced by the Beijing  Municipal Higher People's Court to 15 years in prison and  deprived of political rights for three years, and to 12 years in  prison and deprived of political rights for two years, for  stealing and illegally gathering state financial and economic  secrets. The Beijing Municipal Higher People's Court reached  the final ruling on maintaining the sentences decided on after  the first trial of the two defendants.    Xi Yang, 38, went to Hong Kong from the mainland in June  1992  after inheriting property, and became a MING PAO reporter in  August the same year. From June to July 1993, he was assigned  by the person in charge of the newspaper to conduct activities  in Beijing in the name of covering the Sino-British talks and  inauguration of the Preliminary Work Committee of the  Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative  Region. During his stay in Beijing, he spent most of his time  illegally gathering state financial and economic secrets. Under  Xi's instructions, Tian Ye provided him with top-secret  information concerning China's bank note printing pattern and  the People's Bank of China's plans to sell gold on the  international market; to readjust the foreign exchange rates;  and to again raise bank deposit interest rates, which Tian Ye  had stolen and illegally gathered. Tian Ye also illegally  provided Xi Yang with documents on "An Explanation on the  Provisional Regulations Governing the Dealing of Renminbi by  Foreign-Funded Financial Institutions," which were marked  "confidential." Xi Yang incorporated these state secrets into  articles and sent them to MING PAO for publication, causing  serious economic losses to the state. Tian Ye and Xi Yang were  arrested separately according to the law in October 1993.    The Beijing Municipal People's Procuratorate instituted  proceedings according to the law against Tian Ye and Xi Yang on  14 December 1993. Because the case involved state secrets, the  Beijing Municipal Intermediate People's Court, according to  article 111 of the "Criminal Procedural Law," conducted a  nonpublic trial of the case. During the trial, because some  evidence required further confirmation, the Beijing Municipal  Intermediate People's Court returned the case on 27 January 1994  to the Beijing Municipal People's Procuratorate for evidence  substantiation. On 15 February, the Beijing Municipal People's  Procuratorate again referred the case to the Beijing Municipal  Intermediate People's Court.    Before the trial began, both Tian Ye and Xi Yang said they  did not need an attorney and would defend themselves on their  own. During the trial, both defendants admitted their crimes and  repented what they had done, and asked the court to show  leniency.    After the trial was completed, the Beijing Municipal  Intermediate People's Court ruled that, as a state worker Tian  Ye violated the state's secrecy laws and regulations, and stole  and illegally gathered and provided state secrets; that his act  constituted the crime of stealing and illegally gathering and  providing state secrets; and the case was especially serious.  The court also ruled Xi Yang had ignored state law, stole and  illegally gathered state financial and economic secrets, and  published these secrets in a newspaper outside the country; that  his act constituted the crime of stealing and illegally  gathering state secrets; and the case was especially serious.  The court ruled: The evidence of both defendants' crimes is  well substantiated. According to the "Supplemental Regulations  on the Punishment for the Crime of Revealing State Secrets" of  the National People's Congress Standing Committee -- which  states "Those who steal, illegally gather, buy, or provide state  secrets to organs, organizations, or personnel outside the  country are to be sentenced to 10 years or more in prison, to  life imprisonment, or to death, and are to be deprived of  political rights, if the case is especially serious" -- the  Beijing Municipal Intermediate People's Court, considering that  both defendants had admitted their crimes and confessed, decided  to appropriately reduce the punishment and reached a first-trial  verdict on 28 March 1994, sentencing Tian Ye to 15 years in  prison and depriving him of political rights for three years,  and sentencing Xi Yang to 12 years in prison and depriving him  of political rights for two years. Xi Yang refused to accept  the verdict and lodged an appeal to the Beijing Municipal Higher  People's Court. The Beijing Municipal Higher People's Court,  after completing a second trial of the case, decided to reject  Xi Yang's appeal and maintained the original verdict. The two  criminals' prison terms begin from the date of detention.</p>

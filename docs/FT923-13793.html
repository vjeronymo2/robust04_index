			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Carlton pays Dollars 15m for 10% stake in Savoy Pictures Carlton Communications, the television production and services group has paid Dollars 15m (Pounds 7.8m) to take a 10 per cent stake in Savoy Pictures Entertainment. Savoy was set up five months ago to become a distributor of movies in the US and was founded by former senior executives of Columbia and Tristar studios before their acquisition by Sony. Mr Victor Kaufman, chairman and chief executive of Savoy is a former chairman of Columbia Pictures. Mr Michael Green, the chairman of Carlton which last year won the London weekday ITV licence, believes Savoy could become a major force in the film industry. A more immediate reason for the stake is a five-year output deal with Carlton's film processing and video duplication subsidiary, Technicolor. Under the deal Technicolor will process Savoy pictures and the company has already agreed a 12-film deal with Home Box Office the US film subscription channel. Other shareholders in Savoy include Mitsui, and Mr Frank Pice the former chief executive of Universal Pictures.</p>

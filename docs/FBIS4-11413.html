			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial:"The Constitutional Reform Rests in Peace] </F>   [Text] Having failed to muster 21 votes in the Senate--as  required under Paragraph D, Article 331 of the Constitution--the  Constitutional Reform Bill submitted by the so-called Group of  Five (Radical Batlleism, the MNR [National Rocha Movement], the  PGP [Party of the Government by the People], the MRV [Renewal  and Victory Movement], and the Herreraist Sector) will rest in  peace unless the signatures of 10 percent of the electorate are  collected or a proposal by two-fifths of the full membership of  the General Assembly is approved, in which case said proposal  will be submitted to a plebiscite at the forthcoming elections.    This seems to be the end (unless there is an unexpected turn  of events) of an attempt to reform the Constitution, which, at  the end of last year and after many changes, had received the  support of all the political spectrum. At that time a poorly  supported proposal seemed to be struggling toward a reform of  the electoral system and relations between the three branches of  government. When electoral interests later began to take  precedence over everything else--the reform should have been  ready for the forthcoming November elections--a stalemate was  reached. This logical and predictable state of affairs  culminated in the aforementioned vote on 14 April.    In all likelihood we will have no constitutional reform  unless either of the mechanisms mentioned above are implemented,  or some sectorial interest obtains constitutional protection (as  was the case with old-age pensioners in 1989). We are not very  concerned about this since we have already voiced our skepticism  in previous editorials about the timeliness of such reform (it  was obvious that citizens were a little carried away by this  initiative, moreover it was too close to the elections for it to  materialize) and its purpose (to modifying the electoral system)  lost importance as new sectors became involved. What seemed to  be an important reform of the system of proportional  representation and greater freedom for voters became merely a  set of limited proposals that sought to reform practically  nothing of substance within the Constitution.    It is obvious that we need a true constitutional reform to  eliminate many of the superfluous or harmful articles and  chapters of our Magna Carta. For the time being, we should trim  the excess fat off the Constitution, reducing it to no more than  150 articles. A concise part describing the principles of our  system of government and the inalienable rights of individuals,  with another part establishing the organization of the branches  of government and their interrelation would suffice for our  Constitution. There are too many provisions granting rights  which nobody can claim in court (right to health, to a decent  home, etc.), which results from a way of thinking that deemed  that the law could allegedly confer happiness and prosperity on  all the inhabitants of the Republic.    All provisions pertaining to autonomous bodies and  government-owned enterprises are also unnecessary in the  Constitution, as they should be regulated by law. The same holds  true for the provisions that deal with elections, which are  totally out of place in a constitutional text. A concise,  concrete, and terse Constitution is the best guarantee of  citizens' rights and of the proper functioning of our  institutions.    And yet, we must not become obsessed with the idea that  amending the Constitution and the electoral system is of  paramount importance because it would be of no avail unless a  matching change occurs in the behavior of political leaders. We  need only look at the recent elections in Italy--following the  change in the electoral system, when a total reorganization of  political parties ensued. The vices that this change sought to  weed out continue unabated and the task of forming a government  is today as elusive as it was in the past, if not more so.  Constitutions are not valid substitutes for leaders who serve  their country rather than their party interests.    This constitutional reform rests in peace. Our country  continues to await a true reform. A change in its rulers and  citizens' mentality and behavior is even more necessary. Or, as  Walt Whitman [1819-1892] said, we need people like those who  wrote the U.S. Constitution, as they could make any constitution  work. In other words, texts are less important than the people  who translate them into reality.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 19 (XINHUA) -- The Democratic  People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) Anti-Nuclear and Peace  Committee issued here today a statement strongly protesting  against the United States' deployment of Patriots missiles on  the Korean Peninsula.    It was reported that two transports of the U.S. Navy loaded  with 192 Patriot missiles, 48 launching pads and 84 Stringer  missiles to be deployed in South Korea arrived at Pusan port on  April 18.    The statement said that the shipment of Patriots missiles to  South Korea by the United States led the situation on the Korean  Peninsula to the "brink of war."    By deploying most dangerous weapons -- Patriots missiles in  South Korea, the United States had violated the DPRK-U.S. Joint  Declaration on peacefully solving the nuclear issue on the  Korean Peninsula released last June, the statement said. The  statement demanded that the United States stop at once deploying  the Patriots missiles in South Korea.</p>

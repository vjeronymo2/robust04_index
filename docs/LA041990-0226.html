			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> SANTA ANA MAN SHOT BY OFFICER  </P> <P> A 19-year-old man who was shot by a police officer after allegedly pointing a  gun at the officer was in stable condition this morning at Western Medical  Center in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> Jesus Orejel of Santa Ana was shot in the chest and leg and also suffered  scratches from a police dog during the incident that occurred about 8 p.m. at  Madison Park in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> Orejel was taken into custody on suspicion of assaulting a police officer with  a deadly weapon.  </P> <P> Residents called police just before 8 p.m. Wednesday to complain about a man  firing a gun in the nearby park, said Sgt. Dick Faust. Two officers responded  and when they confronted Orejel, the suspect allegedly pointed a 9-millimeter  semiautomatic Beretta handgun at one of the officers. As the second officer  approached, the suspect turned and pointed the weapon in his direction. The  second officer then fired "several" shots at Orejel.  </P> <P> The suspect then tried to flee on foot but was captured a few blocks away with  the help of a police dog.  </P> <P> The names of the officers involved in the incident were not released. Faust  said the officer who fired the shots will probably be placed on a three-day  administrative assignment, which is customary in shooting cases.  </P></p>

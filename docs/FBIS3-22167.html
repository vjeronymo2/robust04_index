And if Thailand's ambitious plans to build dams on border  rivers are seen through, the Karen could soon weigh heavily on  Thailand's humanitarian conscience.    Living among the river valleys on the border between  Thailand  and Burma, they -- like the Penans in Malaysia -- depend on  having a healthy forest to maintain their way of life. They  have suffered heavily from the intensive logging carried out by  Thai firms in Burmese forests.    Unlike the Penan, of course, the Karen having been fighting  a  war of self-determination against Burma's military regime for  the last 40 years. This has placed them in a vulnerable  position vis-a-vis Thailand, a fact which the government has  exploited to demand timber concessions.    In need of arms and Thailand's favour, the Karen have been  forced to accept the logging. But now Thailand wants to  construct dams on their territory.    Out of its entire winding course from the Tibetan Plateau  down to the Gulf of Martaban, the Salween River only touches the  Thai border for roughly 100 kilometres. Less than six percent  of the river's catchment area lies within Thailand. Yet the  Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (Egat) is planning  to build two major dams on this major river.    The biggest, the Upper Salween Dam, will be located 76 kms  upstream from the confluence of the Moei and Salween Rivers.  The 166-metre high dam would probably flood more than 1,000  square kms of land, almost entirely in Karenni and Shan States  in Burma.    But the electricity and the water would go to Thailand.    The dam would have an installed electricity generating  capacity of 4,540 megawatts, nearly five times more than  Thailand's largest dam making it possibly the biggest dam in  Southeast Asia (Malaysia is planning a 16,000-MW dam in Sarawak  State).    Thailand and Burma are planning seven other joint dam  projects, including the Lower Salween Dam, three on the Moei  River which divides Thailand from Burma further south, and one  dam apiece on the Mae Sai, Mae Nam Kok and Klong Kra Buri.  Plans have been drawn up to pump water from the proposed Moei  and Salween reservoirs over the mountains and into the severely  depleted Phumiphon Reservoir.    Feasibility studies for seven of these projects have already  been carried out at the request of the Thai and Burmese  governments by the secretive, Japan-based Electric Power  Development Corp, a ``special corporation'' largely funded by  the Japanese government and closely connected to Japan's  overseas development aid institutions.    The Upper and Lower Salween Dams are expected to cost around  Bt100 million. With the World Bank turning away from other  large-scale hydro projects such as the Narmada in India, it's  not at all clear where the money will come from.    More to the point, it's not at all clear where the Karen  living along the Salween and Moei River valleys are going to go.  The dams will destroy not only their homes but their way of  life, turning them into refugees.    The Karen will be forced into making a terrible choice,  between living in Slorc [State Law and Order Restoration  Council] concentration camps or Thai refugee camps. Under  outside pressure, the Thai government has quietly tolerated the  presence of Karen refugees, but always with reluctance and  irritation.    If a military force were to move in and kick the Karen off  their land at gunpoint, it would be condemned as naked  aggression. So why should flooding them off their land be  judged any differently? Thailand seems to be embarking on dam  warfare, a serious matter since the people to be displaced are  well-armed.    The Karen are also well aware that electricity for Thailand  means power for Slorc, the military junta now ruling Burma.  ``Thailand will get the energy, Slorc will get the money, and  we will be left to deal with the impacts of the dam,'' one Karen  leader has noted.    Nor is the international community likely to accept this  matter lying down. The U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee  has recently recommended by unanimous vote that the Clinton  administration take a much closer look at the human rights  situation in Burma. According to the London-based human rights  organization Amnesty International, a climate fear is still  prevalent in the country, despite cosmetic changes by the ruling  military junta.    While damming the border rivers may at first glance seem to  be an easy way to generate cheap electricity and -- by filling  up the Phumiphon Reservoir -- to show that dams can work as a  replacement for watershed forests, the hidden costs of these  schemes are overwhelmingly large.    Dams have long been decried as a crime against nature. These  projects on the border rivers, however, are also a crime against  the Karen. And since they are to be imposed on a minority  people for the benefit of a foreign power, they are nothing less  than a crime against humanity.</p>

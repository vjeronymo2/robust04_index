			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Nadir's debt accord challenged An agreement between Mr Rauf Denktash, president of northern Cyprus, and Mr Asil Nadir, the fugitive businessman, over settlement of his estimated Dollars 10m (Pounds 6m) debt to the government faced collapse last night after shareholders of his companies disputed his right to use them to cancel his debt. Mr Denktash announced after a nine-hour cabinet meeting on Wednesday night that Mr Nadir would transfer the Cyprus-based Sunzest citrus company, formerly part of his Polly Peck International group, to the government. In return the government would waive his debts of about Dollars 10m. However, lawyers for PPI's administrators and shareholders denied Mr Nadir's right to sell Sunzest. Although he is a director, they claim, the company is actually owned by an offshoot of an Isle of Man company. They are now threatening court action which could unravel the deal. Mr Nadir owes the government back taxes, unpaid rent on leased government hotels he manages and social security payments deducted from employees' pay but never transferred to the Treasury.</p>

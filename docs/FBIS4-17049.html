			<p>BFN     [Text] Riga, Apr 20, BNS -- The majority of the Saeima  (parliament) factions' leaders support Latvian President Guntis  Ulmanis decision to meet with Russian President Boris Yeltsin on  April 21, Homeland and Freedom faction head Maris Grinblats told  reporters Tuesday [19 April].    As reported, Russian Ambassador to Latvia Aleksandr Rannikh  handed over Tuesday to Ulmanis Russian president's invitation to  meet with him on April 21.    Grinblats said it was not yet clear if the signing of the  Latvian-Russian initialed agreements would be possible during  this visit. But it is clear already now that the agreement on  Russian military pensioners' social guarantees will not be  signed in Moscow, said Grinblats.    As reported, the Saeima will decide Wednesday, during its  extraordinary plenary meeting, if it will authorize Ulmanis to  sign the initialed Latvian-Russian agreements.</p>

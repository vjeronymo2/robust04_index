			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: EVC shares at premium on Amsterdam debut The shares of EVC, western Europe's largest manufacturer of polyvinyl chloride, rose to a premium in their first day of trading in Amsterdam following a successful international equity issue. ICI of the UK and Enichem of Italy each sold 35 per cent stakes, raising a total of Fl 800m, including Fl 100m through the exercise of a so-called greenshoe option. A greenshoe option allows underwriters to compensate for any variance in an offering's price. ICI and Enichem retain 15 per cent minority interests. The shares, initially priced at Fl 77, closed yesterday at Fl 78.10, up Fl 1.10. Two European banks - SG Warburg and UBS - were joint global co-ordinators for the deal, and sold the shares through 'book-building'. Although UK companies have sometimes sold US subsidiaries through this method, the technique has rarely been used for the sale of domestic or European units. Forty per cent of the new equity was raised from investors in the US, 20 per cent from continental Europe and 40 per cent from the UK and the rest of the world. Warburg said that the issue was well received in ths US, where investors see EVC as a strong cyclical play.</p>

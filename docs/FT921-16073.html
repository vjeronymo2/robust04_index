			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / World Trade News: EC, US set for more Gatt talks today MORE talks are expected today between the EC and US over the troubled Gatt trade negotiations, a European Commission spokesman said yesterday, Reuter reports from Brussels. Mr Frans Andriessen, EC external relations commissioner, is likely to raise problems on Gatt when he meets Mr James Baker, US secretary of state, in Washington, he said. Mr Andriessen is expected to hold talks with Mrs Carla Hills, US trade representative, during his trip, which is mainly to discuss aid to the former Soviet Union. Separately, Mr Ray MacSharry, EC farm commissioner, was expected to phone Mr Ed Madigan, US agriculture secretary, today, the spokesman added. He gave no details of subjects likely to be raised at the discussions. These follow failure of EC-US talks last month to reach a deal unblocking the five-year-old Uruguay Round, deadlocked mainly by disagreement between the world's two biggest farm exporters on how far and fast to cut farm support. The EC has also rejected a draft plan put forward by Mr Arthur Dunkel, Gatt director-general, on December 20. EC trade and farm ministers said the plan posed many problems, particularly in agriculture. These ministers are due to meet on January 11 to finalise the EC position, two days before the deadline for all responses to Mr Dunkel's proposals. In another newspaper yesterday, Mr Andriessen said it was difficult to say what the prospects now were for a settlement. 'If there is no deal, both sides will be responsible,' he was quoted as saying. Mr MacSharry said last month that bilateral talks were over and that the process of seeking a farm subsidy compromise would have to continue through Gatt channels. Mr Louis Mermaz, French agriculture minister, said on Sunday he was confident EC members would continue to refuse further compromise.</p>

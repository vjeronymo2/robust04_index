			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Arts: On the Vera Lynn wagon THERE COMES a time in the life of moderately successful actors when they look for a regular annuity to tide them over the quiet periods. Creating a turn built around a character from the past - or present, fact - or fiction, who is of sufficient popular interest to be manipulated into a one man, or one woman, show is the perfect insurance policy. Maggie Ollerenshaw is a familiar TV face, a solid supporting actor in shows like Open All Hours and First of the Summer Wine. She has alighted on Vera Lynn, the Forces Sweetheart, as her vehicle, prompted as much by a passing physical resemblance to the star as to the excitement of her career. It is a show that goes down well in places like Westcliff-on-Sea where fans of Vera, now 76, are likely to be gathered in fair numbers. The very ordinariness of Vera Lynn's life gives it a certain fascination, and makes her achievements more staggering. She was born Vera Welch in East Ham, and by her early teens was earning 7s 6d for belting out three songs in working men's clubs (one and six extra if she won an encore). She was a factory girl for one day but found life on the road as the crooner with the Ambrose band more congenial. Her big break came with the War, when her sentimental songs touched the popular spot. The weekly audience of 16m for her 1941 Sunday night radio show, beamed to the troops, has never been bettered. Ollerenshaw could have been more forthcoming about why the BBC was constantly anxious to drop Lynn, and on the War Office's anxieties that the sentimentality of her music might make the forces homesick and Bolshie. But this is no social document, more a browse through a familiar scrapbook. She delivers the data on Lynn's public, and placid, life (she has stayed happily married for over 50 years) straight and unadorned. Ollerenshaw starts nervously, but by the second half, when she tackles Lynn's great adventure, entertaining the Forgotten Army near the front line in Burma, she has acquired some of the bravura of her subject. A slight surprise is that Ollerenshaw is no singer. Her voice is tremulous and unimpressive compared with Lynn's melodious foghorn. By the end, stomping around the stage in khaki, she was lively enough to cheer up all the old dears in the audience who thought they had come to see the real Vera, and who were desperately keen to join in the choruses. The Palace Westcliff has not made a major contribution to British theatrical history, apart from giving local boy Ray Cooney first runs for his farces, but it earns 74 per cent of its revenue, which suggests it has the local audience taped. It is bullied rather by Eastern Arts, which would like it to be a receiving house for artsy touring groups rather than the regular creator of its own productions, and its subsidy has been halved to Pounds 45,000. But in its unostentatious way the Palace keeps the flag of both drama and light entertainment flying in difficult territory.</p>

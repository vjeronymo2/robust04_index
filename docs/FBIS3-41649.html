On  Wednesday, Toepfer said in Wiesbaden that this issue was  discussed in the Franco-German consultations. The concrete  coat, which was built around the reactor after the disaster in  Ukraine, now has to be overhauled due to erosion processes.  According to Toepfer, several pending questions (such as that  of financing) still have to be clarified before a concrete  decision is taken.    In an event organized by the Konrad-Adenauer-Foundation,  which is close to the Christian Democratic Union [CDU], Toepfer  predicted that the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD]  would change its policy and support an energy consensus with the  inclusion of nuclear energy after the Bundestag election.</p>

The official told KYODO NEWS SERVICE that Russian Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev presented the proposal to his Chinese  counterpart Qian Qichen when the two met in Beijing the same  day.    The official said Kozyrev suggested establishing the zone on  Greater Ussuri Island, known in Chinese as Heixiazi Island. The  Amur river is known as the Heilong river in Chinese.    If the Chinese side agrees to the proposal, it could serve  as  a "model" for resolving a border dispute between Japan and  Russia over four islands to the north of Japan, the official  said.    The disputed islands are Kunashiri, Etorofu, Shikotan and  the  Habomai islet group, all northeast of Hokkaido. They were  seized from Japan by the former Soviet Union at the end of World  War II.    In 1991, China and Russia signed an agreement settling some  of their differences over their common border in the east, but  several portions remain in dispute, including islands in the  Amur River, where Chinese and Soviet soldiers fought battles in  1969.    The official said Kozyrev and Jiang agreed that Chinese  president Jiang Zemin will visit Moscow for the first time in  either October or November this year.    The official said that prior to the visit, Russian Prime  Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin will visit Beijing in May for talks  with Chinese leaders, and Qian will then visit Moscow to  finalize details of agreements to be signed during Jiang's visit.</p>

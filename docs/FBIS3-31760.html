			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Ryszard Malik: "Each One Persisted With His </F> Own Ideas"]    [Text] In Krakow no breakthrough was achieved simply  because such a breakthrough was not possible. It would have  been naive to link the working visit of Andrey Kozyrev with a  hope to "open a new chapter" in Polish-Russian relations, as was  done by some Polish observers after the speech by Andrzej  Olechowski in the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee. Therefore,  Kozyrev did not take us aback when on Wednesday [23 February] on  the forum of the conference "In the Direction of a New  Partnership," he presented rather vague principles for an  all-European partnership and not a concrete vision of the  Russian policy toward the states of Central-Eastern Europe,  including Poland.    In recent years, Poland has not taken advantage of the  opportunity to change its geopolitical location by incorporating  our country into the already existing European security  structure. Now it is probably too late for that. After its  unexpected success in Bosnia, when it presented its large  potential by blocking the NATO action, Russia is even more  reluctant to agree that a state located near its western border  be a member of this organization. The visit of Minister Kozyrev  to the Visegrad Group states (except Slovakia) was paid at a  special moment: the moment of reconstructing the superpower  position of Russia. What could be done by a minister of such a  superpower, the position of which was not negated by anyone?  Kozyrev had to act just as he acted. He had to behave like a  professional diplomat, a friendly interlocutor, but also like a  strong partner that no one can impose anything on.    The Krakow meetings of both ministers, which, incidentally,  were held in a good atmosphere, explained at least one thing:  each party perceives the construction of a new all-European  security structure differently. This, however, is no obstacle  to developing bilateral relations, especially economic contacts.  In this respect the heads of the Russian and Polish diplomacies  were in agreement.</p>

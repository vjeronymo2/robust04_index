This is their ultimatum. FRAPH is threatening to dislodge the  ministers of the resigning Malval government. As of 28 March,  the ministers are no longer to go to their offices.    FRAPH has harshly criticized the management of the resigning  government. During a news conference held by FRAPH leaders on 24  March, the most virulent criticism was aimed at the ministers of  health, agriculture, and education. [passage omitted].    [Begin recording] [Emmanuel Constant, in Creole] We are  asking that all the current ministers of Malval's resigning  government stop going to work, as the parliament directed. We  are very serious about this. We are asking all the ministers not  to go to work on 28 March.    [Louis Jodel Chambelin] If they do not obey, the Haitian  people will come and remove them. And I hope that the next  government arrests all the directors general and the ministers,  so they can explain what they did with the Haitian people's  money [applause] [end recording]    Those were FRAPH leaders Emmanuel Constant and Louis Jodel  Chambelain.</p>

This means closer cooperation between Social  Democrats Against the EU (SME) and No to the EU.    Both SME leader Hallvard Bakke and No to the EU leader  Kristen Nygaard have told AFTENPOSTEN that cooperation on the no  side is now to be strengthened.    "All the groups on the no side now feel that much closer  cooperation is necessary. No to the EU will be the coordinating  body, but this will not lead to any central control," Nygaard  told AFTENPOSTEN.    He said that the time is not yet ripe for weekly meetings,  but that those active on the no side will meet as and when  necessary.    "This means closer cooperation and ongoing consultations."    Labor Party faction Social Democrats Against the EU, the  Center Party, the Christian People's Party, the Liberal Party,  Red Electoral Alliance, and the Workers' Communist Party are all  involved in this cooperation, as are the Norwegian Farmers  Association, the Association of Farmers and Smallholders, and  several youth and environmental organizations. There are also  good contacts with the Norwegian Fishermen's Association that  has its secretariat in Trondheim.    In what ways will you be active in the run-up to the Labor  Party national congress?    "I expect that it will be SME that will tackle this area  first and foremost. The national congress will probably do what  the head of government wants -- which is, to increase the  chances of Norway joining the EU," Kristen Nygaard said.    SME will hold its first national conference in the  Folketeater building in Oslo on 9 and 10 April. This will be  the formal founding of the no organization within the Labor  Party. Hallvard Bakke expects that all the country's provinces  will send representatives, and he is standing formally as the  organization's leader.    Bakke too stresses that it is important to have broad  cooperation on the no side.    "We are working to become as united as possible," he said.    Bakke rejected the suggestion that the SME is working to  recruit the no people for the Labor Party's national congress.    "We are not a faction within the Labor Party. We are working  in relation to the referendum. I expect that there will be a  clear yes majority at the national congress, but the national  congress will not decide anything at all. That is what the  referendum will do," Bakke said.    Asked how many members SME now has, Bakke replied that he  does not know. Nor does he know how many of the Labor Party's  Storting deputies are members of SME.    The battle for Norwegian minds on the subject of the EU is  largely an internal battle within the Labor Party. Storting  deputy Olav Akselsen was one of the 15 Labor Party deputies who  voted against submitting an EU membership application in the  last Storting.    Now he is increasingly doubtful, and membership of SME has  never been a consideration for him:    "It is a militant organization for those who are unshakable  in their faith," Akselsen said.    He views the EU issue as a "question of faith."    "It is a question of what you believe is best for  Norway," he said.    Labor Party Youth Association [AUF] leader Trond Giske is a  member of the interim executive of the SME. He will play an  active role on the no side in the run-up to the referendum. Of  the internal conflict in the AUF he said: "There was a clear  majority at the national conference that opposed the EU."    Giske also made it clear that the AUF will cooperate with  other no organizations and fight its campaign in part through  the SME.    Storting deputy Anneliese Dorum from Akershus is also a  member of the interim board of the SME. She is concerned that  "in the name of democracy" there must be a reasonable split  between yes and no delegates to the Labor Party national  congress.    "It will be up to us as individuals and party members to see  to it that both supporters and opponents are represented at the  national congress," Dorum said.    Akershus will elect its national congress delegates at its  annual general meeting on 23 April.</p>

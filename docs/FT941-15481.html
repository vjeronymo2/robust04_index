			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Non-core but rising profits are appealing - The continuing role of a restructured Hill Samuel within TSB Mr Peter Ellwood, TSB Group's chief executive, yesterday tried once again to clarify his bank's attitude to Hill Samuel, the merchant banking arm which it was widely expected to discard. 'We never actually said that it was for sale, and now we have said clearly that it is not for sale,' he said. The statement was true, but incomplete. TSB circulated an information memorandum to possible buyers of Hill Samuel last year, and Sir Nicholas Goodison, TSB's chairman, hinted at a possible sale when he said it would hold on to Hill Samuel unless it received 'an offer we could not resist'. However, no such offer was received. This meant that Mr Ellwood yesterday faced the task of explaining why TSB now apparently intends to retain a merchant bank and investment management operation despite its oft-repeated strategy of concentrating on its core retail banking and insurance businesses. The obvious reason might be that it is simply making the best of not having received a high enough offer. Selling Hill Samuel certainly appeared to be the reason for TSB's decision last year to isolate in a separate administration unit the bad debts built up through poor corporate lending. This allowed Hill Samuel, which operates in financial services as well as merchant banking and investment management, to register a Pounds 96m profit last year despite a Pounds 142m loss being recorded for the loan administration unit, which now holds Pounds 1.48bn of loans written down to a net Pounds 629m. There appears to be little synergy between TSB's retail and merchant banking businesses. Large banks such as Barclays and National Westminster have tried to raise income by using large corporate lending as a lever to sell clients services such as equities underwriting and foreign exchange dealing. But TSB has few corporate customers to tempt with Hill Samuel's expertise. The merchant bank's main use seems to be as a good investment if it can raise its return on equity from about 10 per cent last year to the group hurdle of 15 per cent post-tax. Seen in this light, Hill Samuel could become attractive. Mr Hugh Freedberg, who was brought in to reshape the business in 1990, says 80 per cent of the restructuring has now occurred. Among the effects are the closure of 11 Hill Samuel branches and a cut in staff last year from 1,600 to 1,100. As significantly, Hill Samuel cut its loan portfolio by Pounds 400m during the year to Pounds 2.1bn. This reduced capital employed in the business to about Pounds 400m. Mr Freedberg predicts that the figures will fall this year to a sustainable level of between Pounds 1.5bn and Pounds 1.7bn of loans, and Pounds 350m capital employed. Mr Freedberg has built up funds under management in the investment management arm from Pounds 20bn to Pounds 26bn, raising profits from Pounds 4m to Pounds 18m last year. However, the financial services business saw profits fall by Pounds 4m to Pounds 13m as customers switched out of life products. The main reforms have come in the merchant bank, where the reduced emphasis on corporate lending has been replaced by efforts to build up its corporate advisory and structured finance activities. The bank now has eight businesses, including aerospace and shipping finance arms. Mr Freedberg cites as an example of Hill Samuel's best type of deal as its corporate advisory role to the government over the Channel tunnel. He says that the bank bid successfully for this mandate by combining its expertise in three areas: corporate finance, project finance and banking. He accepts that Hill Samuel does not gain much corporate business from its parent. He argues, however, that Hill Samuel benefits from TSB's very strong capital, which makes it easier to underwrite securities, and offer long-term swaps which require capital backing. The fact that TSB has such strong capital - its tier one ratio of core capital to risk-weighted assets rose to 8.7 per cent last year, against 7.2 per cent - also means that it has no pressing need to sell Hill Samuel. Whatever the logic of keeping it, it will not be forced to sell. The longer-term question may be whether TSB is tempted to invest in expanding Hill Samuel's range of businesses as well as strengthening those it has. The obvious choice would be to replace the broking and capital markets operations which it lost in 1989 with the sale of Wood Mackenzie. Mr Freedberg says that such talk is premature. 'We need to get a few runs on the board before we think about things like that.' For the moment, Hill Samuel's staff may want to enjoy the luxury of not being the object of speculation over when they will be sold.</p>

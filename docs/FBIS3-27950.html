However, the crack in  the party caused by a confrontation between those who are eager  to change the electoral system and those taking a cautious  attitude cannot be repaired. At an LDP General Council meeting  and at meetings of each faction within the party held on 29  January, members taking a cautious stance increasingly  criticized LDP executives and advocates of political reform for  the agreement reached between Prime Minister Hosokawa and LDP  President Kono at their summit meeting. It is expected that LDP  executives led by President Kono -- who attach more importance  to the views of those eager for political reform and made the  decision "to enact the political reform bills" -- will be forced  to face difficulties managing the party because there is still  the possibility of a split. Meanwhile, they will also be  required to make efforts to promote "harmony within the party."    Although the agreement reached at the summit meeting was  eventually approved by the LDP General Council, members who are  cautious about political reform voiced their dissatisfaction  with the agreement, saying: "Party executives should have  listened to the opinions of other party members before reaching  the agreement" and "if it respects the results of a House of  Councillors vote, the party should have made the decision to  kill the bills without fearing the people's criticism."    At the respective meeting of the Obuchi and Miyazawa  factions, harsh criticism was leveled at the fact that some  political reform advocates conducted a signature-collecting  campaign in an attempt to have the government-proposed bills  adopted at the Diet and to then leave the party. Hiromu Nonaka  said: "The major factor that has led to confusion within the  party is the fact that some advocates of political reform -- who  were thinking about leaving the party -- hold important  positions." Meanwhile, Katsuhiko Shirakawa said: "Some members  said they might leave the party, thus creating a stir within it.  I am tired of the decisionmaking process managed by those  members." In this way, voices calling for a personnel reshuffle  were heard at the meetings.    Among groups which called for giving priority to enacting a  bill designed to prevent political corruption, a move surfaced  aimed at pressing President Kono to step down following  legislation of the political reform bills, and calling for party  renovation.    Ishihara Shintaro and other members who opposed passage of  the bills intentionally failed to attend the plenary session of  the House of Representatives wherein a vote on the political  reform bills was taken. As a future move, they intend to  strengthen their stand of criticizing the LDP leadership led by  President Kono. For that reason, therefore, indications are  that after passage of the political reform bills, such internal  confrontation will have a negative impact on intra-party debates  over how to deal with the new electoral system, and the possible  formation of an alliance with other parties in order to regain  power.</p>

			<p><P> March 7, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE PREPS;  </P> <P> SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BASKETBALL REGIONALS;  </P> <P> DIVISION IV BOYS;  </P> <P> WHITTIER CHRISTIAN TO PLAY SAN DIEGO CORONADO  </P> <P> Whittier Christian High School, after winning the Southern Section 2-AA  basketball championship Saturday, enters the Southern California Regionals  today as the third-seeded team in Division IV.  </P> <P> Whittier Christian (22-6) will play San Diego Coronado (11-14) at La Habra High  School in a first-round game tonight at 7:30.  </P> <P> Whittier Christian, led by 6-foot-7 center Scott Ferguson (19 points and 11  rebounds a game) and 6-4 forward Paul McKinley (21 points, 9 rebounds), may not  have too great a challenge in Coronado, the only team in the division playoffs  with a losing record. Derek Wastila, a 6-5 junior center, leads Coronado with  14 points a game.  </P> <P> Wastila is supported by 5-6 guard Tim DeWitt, 6-3 forward Jesse MacNeill and  6-2 guard Tom Mitchell, who was the San Diego Section player of the year in  water polo last fall.  </P> <P> "When you're facing these unknown teams, you are always a little hesitant in  what to say to the kids," Whittier Christian Coach Bob Brown said. "But I feel  good. I feel we got a real good seeding for the first round."  </P> <P> In other Division IV play:  </P> <P> Orange Lutheran (23-4) vs. El Cajon Christian (14-11) at Granite Hills High:  Orange Lutheran, which defeated Whittier Christian twice en route to the  Olympic League title this season, qualified for the regionals as an at-large  entry after losing, 78-54, to 2-A champion Santa Clara Saturday.  </P> <P> Orange Lutheran, coming off its worse performance of the season Saturday when  it shot just 32% from the field after averaging 55% all season, will meet a  good shooting team.  </P> <P>  El Cajon Christian, which defeated Coronado, 70-60, Saturday for the section  Division IV title, is especially capable at the free throw line. Saturday it  converted 21 of 22 free throws.  </P> <P> Its top player, 6-1 guard David Jeremiah, is a three-year starter who averages  21.6 points. In one game this season, he made 10 three-point shots.  </P> <P> Darrell White, a 6-5 senior forward, averages 20 points for Coronado. Other  starters are 6-3 forward Tim Barkett, 6-foot junior guard Brad Fox and 6-10,  215-pound center Dan Tate.  </P> <P> Tate, though intimidating in size, rarely scores in double figures. He scored  just two points in Saturday's victory.  </P></p>

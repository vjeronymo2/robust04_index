			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Harmony pressed to make board changes as losses soar REBEL shareholders at Harmony Leisure yesterday repeated their call for board changes after the USM-quoted restaurants group announced a 70 per cent increase in pre-tax losses. In the year to March 29 losses reached Pounds 3.68m compared with a 1990-91 deficit of Pounds 2.17m. Turnover fell from Pounds 9.63m to Pounds 6.45m as the directors admitted that 'trading conditions were the worst the company has ever encountered'. The pre-tax result was struck after exceptional charges of Pounds 2.66m (Pounds 1.13m) to cover restructuring and disposals, including an estimated Pounds 1.99m reduction in the value of its fixed assets. Losses per share increased to 13.83p (8.07p). No dividend has been paid since the year ended March, 1989. The dissident shareholders have requisitioned an extraordinary meeting and claim more than 30 per cent of the shareholders have backed their moves to replace the executive directors. Rebel leader Mr Simon Lynch, a former managing director of the HH Finch pub group, yesterday described the latest losses as 'unbelievable'. 'I don't see how the board will be able to continue.' Mr Stanley Lever, Harmony managing director, said the company would try to cut costs and pledged to take 'whatever steps are appropriate to de-gear. 'We are determined Harmony will be well positioned to take advantage of any improvement in the economy'.</p>

			<p><P> July 25, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PAPER TRUCE;  </P> <P> PUBLISHER STUDIES SALE TO COMPETING WEEKLY HE FOUNDED 11 YEARS AGO  </P> <P> Eleven years ago, Daniel J. Schmidt, then a 23-year-old journalism student,  borrowed $2,000 from his parents to start a weekly newspaper, the Moorpark News  in Moorpark.  </P> <P> After a year, it was clear the paper was struggling. "I didn't know anything  about business," Schmidt recalled. So he sold the paper for $10,500, agreed not  to compete against the News for five years, and went elsewhere to work as a  reporter.  </P> <P> Five years and two weeks later, Schmidt returned to Moorpark to start a weekly  newspaper, the Moorpark Mirror, to try to sink the News. The News "had eroded  in quality," he said. "I knew Moorpark needed another newspaper."  </P> <P> This time Schmidt had more staying power. His Mirror managed to survive for  five years by often taking community leaders to task -- sometimes excessively,  his critics say -- and by hustling for advertising. The News "palled around  with all the community big shots," he said. "They did all the PR kinds of  things, all the fluff kinds of stories, and left the real meat for me, and I  went after it with a vengeance."  </P> <P> But the Mirror did not sink the News, which has deeper pockets than Schmidt.  The News is jointly owned by two newspaper groups, Harris Enterprises of  Hutchinson, Kan., and John P. Scripps Newspapers of San Diego, a unit of E.W.  Scripps Co. And the Mirror and News say that as they struggled against each  other, neither was making big profits.  </P> <P> Now, however, Schmidt and the News are about to make peace. Last week, Schmidt  tentatively agreed to sell the Mirror to the News for an undisclosed price.  </P> <P> The sale "gives me an opportunity to collect in one lump sum the spoils of six  years of hard work, and gives me the resources and time to launch my next  project," perhaps another newspaper, Schmidt said in an interview.  </P> <P> The News claims that about 1,500 people buy its paper, and that another 1,000  are given away each week to various neighborhoods to spur additional  subscriptions. The Mirror, meanwhile, claims a paid circulation of 500, but it  gives out about 3,700 free issues. The paper is owned by Schmidt alone.  </P> <P> Debra W. Ryono, editor and publisher of the News, said her paper's decision to  buy out Schmidt was an option that the News had considered several times in the  past.  </P> <P> The News-Mirror fight was unusual in that Schmidt was, in effect, competing  against his past. But it also was unusual in that Moorpark, a town of about  30,000 just north of Thousand Oaks in Ventura County, had managed to support  two independent weekly papers at a time when even big cities are increasingly  unable to generate enough advertising and readership to host two or more  hometown publications.  </P> <P> The number of U.S. cities with two or more daily newspapers under separate  ownership currently totals 43, or only 3% of the 1,526 total dailies, according  to the American Newspaper Publishers Assn., a trade group in Washington.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Other Competition  </P> <P> Nonetheless, the News and the Mirror still had to fight for advertising dollars  with several daily newspapers that also are sold in Moorpark, including The  Enterprise in Simi Valley, the News Chronicle in Thousand Oaks and the Ventura  County Star-Free Press. (Harris and Scripps also own The Enterprise.)  </P> <P> Schmidt agreed to the sale even though it appeared Moorpark's surging growth  might generate enough new business, and therefore advertising, to support both  the News and the Mirror.  </P> <P> Moorpark, long known as an agricultural hamlet, has been caught up in Los  Angeles' progress. Acres of new houses are being built and, although Moorpark  has a slow-growth plan to limit the expansion, the town's population has nearly  doubled in the last three years.  </P> <P> Yet although Schmidt is preparing to sell the Mirror, it's unclear whether the  Mirror will go out of business.  </P> <P> Schmidt claimed he will "not sell the Mirror if the Mirror ceased to exist  after the sale," and that the Mirror's future is a detail yet to be worked out  before the sale can proceed. "I didn't work six years just to be bought off and  chased out of town," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Nothing Final  </P> <P> The News' Ryono said "this is all open for discussion, nothing is definite  yet." But, indicating that the News expects only one paper to survive, she said  a merged "Moorpark News Mirror" might be the end result.  </P> <P> Ryono said last week that it was not immediately known if Schmidt would  continue with the Mirror or the News after the sale. If so, he would be joining  a newspaper he has heavily criticized. A few days before the merger plans were  announced, Schmidt said the News had "ignored controversial subjects" in its  news coverage. The Mirror challenged Moorpark's power structure, Schmidt said,  while the News has "cozied up to it."  </P> <P> Ryono denied Schmidt's characterization of her paper, and said "people  sometimes tend to think that Dan takes things maybe a little bit out of  context, or blows them up a little bit more than what they should be." Besides,  she said, "he doesn't carry as much news" as her paper.  </P> <P> The News views itself as a traditional, family-oriented local newspaper that  covers not only crime, environmental problems and other pressing concerns, but  also reports on piano recitals or pinning ceremonies at the Cub Scouts.  "Everybody likes to see their name in the newspaper," Ryono said.  </P> <P> Schmidt, meanwhile, likes challenging the actions of the City Council and other  community leaders, and seems to relish the animosity his stories generate.  "Dan's outlook has always been more of a muckraker at City Hall; he likes to  stir things up," Ryono said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Legal Notices  </P> <P> Schmidt also believes he scored a coup a few weeks ago when he won the contract  to print the city's legal notices -- the announcements of public hearings and  so forth that the city is required to publish -- by underbidding the News,  which had the contract in recent years. Schmidt asked for 50 cents per line of  type from the city; the News sought 53 cents.  </P> <P> It also prompted him to call the Mirror "Moorpark's Newspaper of Record." The  contract "was more than just a moral victory, it was a marketing victory as  well, because for five years they had it, and now they've lost it," Schmidt  said of the News.  </P> <P> Ryono downplayed Schmidt's victory. "I would have liked to have kept them," she  said of the notices. "I don't know how many people get a paper, though, just  because of the city legals running in it."  </P> <P> In fact, lots of Moorpark residents aren't buying either paper, given the  number of free issues each delivers. But the freebies have a purpose: They help  the News and Mirror persuade advertisers that their papers are reaching a wide  audience, and it's advertising that pays the bulk of a newspaper's bills, not  paid subscriptions.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Advertising Competition  </P> <P> But having two weeklies in town forces many advertisers to make a choice. Simi  Valley Bank, for instance, advertises regularly in The Enterprise of Simi  Valley, which also sells in Moorpark. So rather than advertise in the News,  which is owned by the same people, it runs half-page ads in the Mirror for $234  a week.  </P> <P> "We're trying to cover our bases," said Barbara Williamson, a vice president of  the bank.  </P> <P> Now the advertisers might have one fewer choice if the News and the Mirror  merge. But Schmidt insists there will be no merger unless the Mirror continues  to be published by its proposed new owner.  </P> <P> He said that if the sale is "simply a way for Goliath to say to David, 'We're  going to get rid of you and go back to business as usual,' I'm prepared to  stick around another six years."  </P> <P> But publisher Ryono said that if the deal goes through to buy Schmidt's paper,  it'll probably have the usual clause preventing him from starting another paper  in town.  </P></p>

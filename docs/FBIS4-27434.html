			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Masuo Matsuoka, secretary general of the </F> ruling Japan New Party, by unidentified SANKEI SHIMBUN reporter  on 27 May -- place not given]    [Text] In an interview with a SANKEI SHIMBUN reporter on  27 May, Masuo Matsuoka, secretary general of the ruling Japan  New Party [JNP], indicated that the JNP will work for a return  of the opposition Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] to the  ruling coalition. The following is a summary of the interview:    [SANKEI SHIMBUN] Four more legislators have quit the JPN.  What is your opinion?    Matsuoka: The JNP by nature is a political group formed by  Mr. Morihiro Hosokawa, who has a strong sense of mission and  people with differing political beliefs. It has been difficult  to keep the JPN together. The JNP has played the role of  coordinator between Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and the  Komeito [Clean Government Party], and the SDPJ when they have  discussed policies. Those legislators who have broken away from  our party advocated that the JNP must forge an alliance with the  SDPJ and the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP] and cut off its  alliance with Shinseito and the Komeito. I believe it would have  been better if they had remained in our party and played a  pivotal role in realigning the established political parties  instead of quitting our party.    [SANKEI SHIMBUN] Those breakaway legislators bitterly  complained that Mr. Hosokawa and the JPN leadership were  excessively dependent on Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of  Shinseito, and Yuichi Ichikawa, secretary of the Komeito. What  do you think?    Matsuoka: Mr. Hosokawa had difficulty running the coalition  government because it was formed by seven parties and one  parliamentary group. Former Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi  Takemura needed to take a low profile as coordinator of the  coalition partners, but he played into the hands of the news  media which criticized "Mr. Ichiro Ozawa as a villain." As a  result, Mr. Hosokawa stepped down as prime minister.    [SANKEI SHIMBUN] A majority of JNP members favor breaking up  the unified parliamentary group "Kaishin." What do you think?    Matsuoka: Even if the unified parliamentary group is  dissolved, the SDPJ cannot return to the coalition government at  the present stage. No decision has been made about the  appointment of major posts in the parliamentary group. The  parliamentary group is inconsequential. Our party cannot make  any moves under present circumstances. Our party has no choice  but to take a wait-and-see attitude.    [SANKEI SHIMBUN] If the JNP asks the breakaway legislators  and the SDPJ to return to the ruling coalition, what sort of  political tactics is your party going to employ?    Matsuoka: I do not like the words political tactics, but  what  is important is purpose. As for the political tactics, the  breakaway legislators and the SDPJ should have vigorously argued  while remaining in the ruling coalition instead of complaining  like defeatists.    [SANKEI SHIMBUN] The SDPJ is indicating that it would return  to the ruling coalition on the premise that the Hata cabinet  resigns en masse. What is your comment?    Matsuoka: We intend to sincerely apologize the SDPJ for our  impoliteness. An SDPJ leader has made ambivalent remarks that  can be interpreted to mean either the SDPJ hopes for a  dissolution of the House of Representatives or the SDPJ hopes  for a general resignation of the Hata cabinet. The SDPJ leader,  however, has proposed re- examining the framework of the  coalition and his proposal is worthy of welcome. We are in  contact with the SDPJ and we have a channel for the contact.    [SANKEI SHIMBUN] The JNP is strengthening its ties with the  DSP.    Matsuoka: The JNP and the DSP share almost the same  political  beliefs and policies. They are friendly toward each other, and  they are in almost the same position. The two parties began  their policy discussion from this week. I do not know whether  the two parties will be merged into a new party.    [SANKEI SHIMBUN] It has been decided that Masatoshi Miyama,  Mr. Hosokawa's former secretary, will testify in the Diet. What  is your opinion?    Matsuoka: Directors of the Budget Committee of the House of  Representatives have decided to demand his testimony in the  Diet. They have decided to make that demand after concluding  that they can no longer delay the passage of the 1994 budget  bill in the Diet. It is arrogant to use the parliamentary  majority to force Mr. Miyama to testify in the Diet. They have  set a bad precedent.    [SANKEI SHIMBUN] Mr. Hosokawa is expected to be unable to  avoid testifying in the Diet.    Matsuoka: Mr. Hosokawa took full responsibility by resigning  as prime minister. Thanks to Mr. Hosokawa, the rule of the  Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] has collapsed and the coalition  government has come into being. In retaliation, the LDP is  waging a campaign aimed at crushing the JNP and Mr. Hosokawa.</p>

			<p><P> March 30, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TOP MANAGEMENT MUST SUPPORT COMPUTER USE, MIT STUDY SAYS  </P> <P> Unless top managers support the productive use of computers and other  information technology with training and new corporate strategies, their  companies may not survive the 1990s, an MIT study said Wednesday.  </P> <P> The findings were drawn from a 5-year research program conducted by the  Massachusetts Institute of Technology and sponsored by Arthur Young and 11  other companies, including American Express Co. and Eastman Kodak Co.  </P> <P> Arthur Young's 40-page report on the MIT study said executives should adopt a  more liberal attitude toward technology.  </P> <P> "Corporate executives may be blind-sided unless they understand its strategic  impact, actively support it and contribute creatively to the use of information  technology in their firms," the Arthur Young report concluded.  </P> <P> William Gladstone, chairman of the management consulting firm, said U.S.  executives should also be more alert about new technological developments.  </P> <P> "In recent years, we have been . . . as a nation, slower than our foreign  competitors, to anticipate new technologies and the vast markets they generate  here at home," he said.  </P> <P> Gladstone said managers could no longer afford to be passive.  </P> <P> "The old process whereby the technology professional told management what will  or can be done is reversing," he said. "Now, management must set the  direction."  </P> <P> Gladstone predicted corporate survival will also hinge on the way human  resources managers introduce new technology to employees.  </P> <P> "All of this means that people need to change the way they work," he said.  </P> <P> John Sifonis, national director of strategic management consulting services for  Arthur Young, said corporate success during the coming decade requires the  strong support of top executives.  </P> <P> "If you have a positive attitude, that trickles down" to lower levels of an  organization, new technology will pay off, Sifonis said.  </P></p>

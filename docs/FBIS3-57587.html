			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Algirdas Brasauskas, "exclusively </F> for BERLINER ZEITUNG by IMA Press;" place and date not given:  "We Want NATO Membership, But There Is No Feeling of Threat"]    [Text] [BERLINER ZEITUNG] Mr. President, what made the  Lithuanians officially apply for NATO membership?    [Brazauskas] This decision is part of an ongoing process.  Since the declaration of independence in 1990, we have proceeded  along this path. This step is in line with the atmosphere in  our society.    The precondition was the withdrawal of the Russian Army.  Then I exchanged letters with NATO Secretary General Manfred  Woerner. The resolution adopted by the Sejm on this issue on 23  December was also of major significance in this respect.    [BERLINER ZEITUNG] Does your country feel threatened by  Russia?    [Brazauskas] No.    [BERLINER ZEITUNG] When you applied for NATO membership, did  you take into consideration possible reactions by Moscow? Were  there any consultations?    [Brazauskas] We expected a reaction from Moscow. It was  quite strong and reflects the complicated situation in Russia  itself. Yet we do not believe that this reaction is a danger to  the good relations between Russia and Lithuania. We hope that  every European country will find its place in the new European  security structures.    [BERLINER ZEITUNG] The collapse of the USSR began in the  Baltic states. It seems as though the integration of former  communist republics into Western structures begins there, too.  Do you have the feeling that you are playing a special role and  fulfilling a historic mission?    [Brazauskas] I do not believe that a single country, large  or small, should be claiming that it is fulfilling a historic  mission.    [BERLINER ZEITUNG] Do you think that Lithuania's acceptance  by the European Union might be sufficient as far as military  security is concerned, or will NATO membership remain the vital  and imperative objective?    [Brazauskas] We do not expect the issue of our NATO  membership to be settled positively in the near future. Yet we  hope that the process leading to membership will soon be  initiated. Lithuania believes that it will join NATO via the  European Union. To use a metaphor, the European Union will open  the door for us. If we are able to make use of the new  opportunities, we will be much closer to NATO.    [BERLINER ZEITUNG] Mr. President, do you believe that in the  current new historical period NATO should be giving way to new  and broader security structures, including both the NATO states  and the members of the former Warsaw Pact?    [Brazauskas] Forecasts are not very useful. What is  important is for all countries from Vancouver to Vladivostok to  feel secure in the future.    [BERLINER ZEITUNG] If Lithuania, Poland, Hungary, and the  Czech Republic should become NATO members, Moscow will be left  "outside." Do you think that this might have the effect of  making Russia feeling psychologically isolated and less secure  than today?    [Brazauskas] The system of antagonistic military blocs in  Europe and the world should not be revived. We are obliged to  ensure that the transformation and expansion of NATO does not  provoke any hostile reactions from Russia. Lithuania does not  want to isolate its eastern neighbors. I would like to make it  clear that Lithuania's position toward NATO is not directed  against neighboring states or other European countries, which  must all find their place in the new security structures of the  continent.</p>

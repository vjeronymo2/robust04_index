			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bulls return to London's copper and coffee markets The copper and coffee markets, pacemakers in the recent commodities bull run, were back in favour again yesterday. The London Metal Exchange's flagship contract opened just above Dollars 2,300 a tonne for three months delivery, before surging to a 17-month high of Dollars 2,377 as speculative money piled back into the market. It closed a few dollars off the top at Dollars 2,375.50 a tonne, up Dollars 105 on the day. Although investment fund buyers played a big part in recent weeks, copper's performance was underpinned by growing physical demand, which had been reflected in 23 successive falls in LME warehouse stocks, dealers told the Reuters news agency. Coffee prices soared again as the market threw off its recent bout of profit-taking. The September futures contract at the London Commodity Exchange rose by Dollars 91 a tonne to Dollars 2,115 a tonne with the New York market staging a big increase at the opening of trading. Traders were jumpy about reports of cooler weather in Brazil as a frost could affect the almost-mature beans, although this was not seen as a major threat. In addition a one-day port strike in Santos, a big Brazilian coffee shipment point, gave the market the jitters and helped to push prices higher. 'There is still considerable upside potential in this market. We've just had a respite and I believe we will go on to challenge and go through the recent highs,' said Mr Bill O'Neill, soft commodities analyst at Merrill Lynch in New York.</p>

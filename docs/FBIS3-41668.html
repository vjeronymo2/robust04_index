During the first half of this year, a total of 13,966 guinea  worm cases were reported throughout the country compared to  25,966 cases reported during the same period last year.    This is contained in the July 1993 report of Global 2000  Guinea Worm Project, a copy of which was made available to the  GRAPHIC at Saltpond or Thursday after a workshop for 35  guinea-worm eradication volunteers.    The report noted that with the possible exception of the  Northern Region, the number of infested villages is sufficiently  small enough that a monthly visit by the co-ordinators to each  endemic village would ensure the adoption of preventive measures.    A supplementary report on the Central Region signed by Dr  Richard Yaw Osei, Regional Director of Health Services also  stated that the region achieved 100 per cent filter distribution  to about 42,000 households in December last year. It stated a  survey carried out in January this year indicated that 80 per  cent of the population actually used the monofilterment filters  but 20 per cent were worn out due to vigorous washing.    It said 120 endemic communities have been supplied with  portable water since 1989 while about 130 endemic communities  have been earmarked for portable water by the end of 1993.</p>

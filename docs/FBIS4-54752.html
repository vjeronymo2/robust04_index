			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Bratislava HOSPODARSKE NOVINY in Slovak  on 28 and 29 April carries two installments, both of which are  on pages 1 and 3, 1,100 and 700 words, respectively, of an  interview with Slovak Privatization Minister Milan Janicina by  Peter Visvader on the second round of coupon privatization. The  place and date of the interview are not given. The latter  edition of HOSPODARSKE NOVINY also publishes, on page 2, a  350-word TA SR report on a news conference on the second wave of  privatization given by the same Privatization Minister Janicina  in Bratislava on 28 March.    In the first installment of the interview, Janicina speaks  about the "successful launching of coupon privatization being  the number-one priority"; he goes on to say that "on 2 May, we  move to Senec, where we are going to prepare privatization so  that the list of enterprises offered in the second round can be  published on 22 August. We expect the beginning of citizens and  privatization funds registration on 1 September 1994. Before  the end of our term of office, we intend to reach an  irreversible stage in the launching of coupon privatization,  regardless of election results." The most important thing to  guarantee a smooth privatization process is uncequivocally,  according to Janicina, "the precise processing of  property-related legal documentation for the privatized  enterprises." Asked about the criticism that coupon  privatization does not provide the funds needed for developing  the enterprises, the minister says that, "even within the  framework of coupon privatization, it is possible to obtain  capital by setting aside a part of the enterprise property for a  direct sale." Furthermore, he argues, constant delays prevent  the completion of individual projects of so-called wild  privatization, and, in the process, they do not generate any  capital, either. When the interviewer observes that the  government has canceled 13 decisions made by its predecessor,  "all of them projects within the framework of so-called wild  privatization," and asks whether this trend is to continue,  Janicina replies that "there were problems with privatization  even earlier, but they became throughly obvious on 14 February."  On the other hand, the minister says, "because of the great  amount of work and the limited capacity of the ministry, I would  not want to concentrate on checking all projects. We want to do  some positive work." The strategic enterprises--arms industry,  power generation, etc.--pose a problem because of the need to  guarantee the strategic intentions of the state. So far, a  permanent participation of the National Property Fund was  considered the solution. According to Janicina, however, "the  strategic interests of the state must be clearly identified, the  manner of their implementation formulated, and the statutes of  the specific companies adjusted according to the needs. If that  is accomplished, the strategic intentions can be realized even  with a minority participation of the fund, and the majority can  be offered in coupon privatization."    The second installment of the interview opens with a  question  concerning Janicina's opinion on employee stockholding  companies. The minister first notes that the law does not define  anything like that, then continues to say that he does not claim  bad intentions in all such companies but that the experience he  made in this respect is not good. He illustrates this point by  quoting letters from workers at such enterprises who believe it  better "to sell the company to foreign capital than to leave it  to the comrades who are still in the company management." After  all, "these companies are usually founded with a 50-percent  stake going to three- or four-member management and 50 percent  to all other employees." The assessment of the first round of  privatization identified numerous problems. Nevertheless,  Janicina says that, "because of the government's limited time in  office, a change of laws is not feasible. We will influence the  legislation by government directives." The interview concludes  with Janicina addressing a major problem of Slovak  privatization--namely, that "the book value of the enterprises  is very high, while the market price is relatively low, and the  price offered by foreign investors is frequently even lower.  That is the reason standard privatization methods are so slow."  The difference in prices is dealt with in lengthy talks.  Janicina says he would be glad "if at least three or four sales  to foreign investors could be realized before his term in office  expires."    Bratislava HOSPODARSKE NOVINY on 29 April carries a TA SR  report on news conference given by Janicina in Bratislava on 28  March. Here, Janicina says that he, together with the ministers  of the founding sectors, is to prepare "the list of the state  enterprises, the property of which is to be offered in the  second wave of privatization, by 20 May. The schedule and rules  for coupon privatization are to be detailed by 10 May."  Janicina promises to exert every effort so that "the value of  property offered amounts to at least 80 billion Slovak korunas."  At the same time, he says, "if I remain minister, under no  circumstances will I support, and will, in fact, do everything  in my power against, direct sales to prearranged owners such as  fellow party members." The ministers states, however, that a  direct sale to a prearranged owner could still possibly take  place if "a foreign investor with a good reputation appears on  the scene with an offer interesting to Slovakia." State  Secretary Palacka calls the phrase (direct sale to prearranged  owner) unfortunate and emphasizes that "all projects will be  published, and counterproposals can always be submitted. One of  these projects is then selected, so there is always a certain  amount of competition."</p>

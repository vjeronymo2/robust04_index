			<p><P> September 19, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> STATWATCH: GRANADA HILLS QUARTERBACK THROWS A 7  </P> <P> If sharing the wealth helps keep a team happy, then the receivers at Granada  Hills High must be flashing lots of enamel. Friday's win was cause for a  goal-line-to-goal-line grin.  </P> <P> Senior quarterback Bryan Martin completed 17 of 22 passes for 166 yards in a  26-10 victory over Lynwood, and the 17 completions were distributed among seven  players.  </P> <P> Alonzo Finney (seven receptions), Brett Washington (four), Kyron Motton (two),  Earl Andrews, Robert Haywood, John Moss and Felix Shin each caught at least one  pass. Lynwood might find it difficult to believe, but the Highlanders were  without their best receiver, senior Eric Moss, who was sidelined because of a  shoulder injury.  </P> <P> "We were substituting a lot because a bunch of our guys go both ways," Granada  Hills co-Coach Tom Harp said. "With Eric Moss out, we needed to play different  guys."  </P> <P> Eric Moss, no relation to John, said that he expects to play Saturday against  Dorsey.  </P> <P> Defense: The Canyon defense, dubbed the "No-Names" by Coach Harry Welch, has  allowed just two touchdowns in its first three games against Honolulu St.  Louis, Hart and Notre Dame. Canyon is allowing an average of 62 yards on the  ground. . . . Quartz Hill, for all of its offensive prowess (102 points and 800  yards rushing in two games), is even stingier on defense than Golden League  rival Canyon. In two games, the Rebels have surrendered 40 yards on the ground.  </P> <P> Fillmore is one of three area teams to notch shutouts in its first two games  (St. Francis and Paraclete are the others) with a 26-0 win over Pater Noster  and a 17-0 victory over Oak Park, which scored 63 points in its opener against  Leffingwell Christian. Fillmore's defense, led by linebacker Anthony Chessani  and defensive backs Art Sosa and Steve Clinton, has allowed a total of 248  yards, 71 on the ground.  </P> <P> Offense: Life after Tim Gutierrez has been tough for Santa Clara. The former  Saints quarterback, a redshirt at San Diego State, passed for 7,272 yards in  his three-year career. In two games this fall, Santa Clara has gained 72 yards  through the air. . . . Canyon has punted just once this season.  </P> <P> San Fernando's return to the wishbone was successful in Friday's 23-0 defeat of  Fremont. Running backs Leonice Brown (79 yards), Will Taylor (73), LaKarlos  Townsend (42) and Johnnie Brown (six) combined for 200 yards in 33 attempts.  </P> <P> Records: If not for intra-city play, the three Burbank schools still would be  looking for their first win. Burroughs and Bell-Jeff are each 0-2 and have been  outscored a combined 131-14. Burbank High posted the city's first win with a  22-14 victory over Bell-Jeff last week after dropping its opener to Hoover,  24-7. . . . On the other side of the ledger, Hoover and Glendale have kept  their city unbeaten in four games.  </P></p>

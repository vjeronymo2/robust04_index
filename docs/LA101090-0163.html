BRIEFING;  </P> <P> SOME FOUND ALLERGIC TO PSYLLIUM  </P> <P> Psyllium, a cereal grain that is supposed to do wonders for a person's  cholesterol count, may spark a life-threatening allergic reaction, according to  a letter to be published in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine.  </P> <P> Dr. Martin J. Kaplan of Highland Park, Ill., said a 43-year-old patient  developed an allergic reaction shortly after eating Kellogg's "Heartwise"  cereal, which contains psyllium. Her face, eyes, mouth and tongue swelled, and  she coughed and vomited before fainting.  </P> <P> The woman, a nurse, recovered in a local hospital.  </P> <P> In a response to the letter, a Kellogg official acknowledged that "there have  been approximately 50 reported allergic reactions to the product."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Defense Minister Joe Modise is to have last week's  interdict against the WEEKLY MAIL withdrawn.    The court interdict was to prevent the paper from publishing  information about former members of the defense force's  Directorate of Covert Collection. The information concerned  allegations that certain members of the ANC alliance, the PAC  [Pan-Africanist Congress] and others had acted as informants of  the apartheid state. Mr. Joe Modise said the information can be  published as it doesn't pose a threat to the democratic  transition. In a statement, the minister reiterated his  commitment to the principle of press freedom.</p>

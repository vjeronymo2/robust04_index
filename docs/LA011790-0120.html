			<p><P> January 17, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SEA VIEW LEAGUE GIRLS' BASKETBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> EVEN WITHOUT EARLE, ESTANCIA BREEZES PAST NEWPORT HARBOR  </P> <P> The Estancia High School girls' basketball team ended its two-game Sea View  League losing streak with a 63-43 victory over Newport Harbor Tuesday night at  Newport Harbor.  </P> <P> Without leading scorer and point guard Melody Earle, the Eagles (7-8, 1-2)  struggled while losing to University and Saddleback. Earle chipped a bone in  her left ankle in the opening round of the Marina Tournament. But she continued  to limp through several games before sitting out the first two league games on  the advice of her doctor, Estancia Coach Lisa McNamee said.  </P> <P> Tuesday night the Eagles again looked as if they would struggle without Earle's  18 points a game, but Estancia outscored Newport Harbor, 26-11, in the fourth  quarter to turn a close game into a rout.  </P> <P> Estancia took advantage of the boards and the Sailors' 30 turnovers with  Monique Sweet pushing the ball up court for easy transition baskets.  </P> <P> "We haven't been able to get rolling without Melody," Estancia Coach Lisa  McNamee said. "Tonight we had other people respond offensively."  </P> <P> Those other people were sophomore Sweet and senior Liz Collins. Sweet, who had  been averaging 14 points, stepped up her offensive production. She led all  scorers with 26 points. Collins responded on the boards grabbing 19 rebounds  and scoring 12 points. Estancia continually scored second-chance baskets when  Sweet wasn't pushing the ball up court, but the real key was defense.  </P> <P> "I told them at halftime that Stacey Giem was getting a little bit frustrated  on offense, and she basically is their offense," McNamee said. "No doubt about  it, Patrice (Lumpkin) holding her down was the key to the game."  </P> <P> Lumpkin scored 15 points and held Giem to 16. Jenni Hall added 13 for Newport  Harbor (5-8, 1-2).  </P> <P> Estancia led, 41-38, with five minutes to play when Sailor point guard Alison  Izumita left the game with her fifth foul. Collins sank both free throws,  Lumpkin added a basket and Sweet, who was fouled, made her first free throw.  She missed her second but Collins' follow was good for a three-point play that  put Estancia firmly in front, 48-38.  </P> <P> In other Sea View games:  </P> <P> University 44, Saddleback 30 -- Senior forward Denise Gandara scored 25 points  and had 11 rebounds to lead University (12-4, 2-1). Sophomore center Tara Wolff  had eight points, a career-high 20 rebounds and six blocked shots.  </P> <P> Tustin 66, Corona del Mar 29 -- Christine Garner had 21 points and Nancy Vinh  had 12 as Tustin (14-5, 3-0) outscored host Corona del Mar 24-1 in the fourth  quarter.  </P></p>

This statement was made  by the Mexican Bishops Conference [CEM] in a document charging  the existence of a clandestine network fostering very close ties  between the drug traffic, violence, and the arms trade. [passage  omitted]    In the document, titled "The Drug Traffic, Pastoral Concern  of the Church," released yesterday by the General Secretariat of  Bishops, the church explains that the consequences of  clandestine drug production are clearly evident, namely:  insecurity, anxiety, violence, and family disintegration. An  atmosphere of terror is being created, with involuntary  emigrations, threats, and pressure.    It goes on to say that drugs provide fast, easy money gained  through illegal means. This is causing a destructive change in  the society's culture and way of thinking. Juvenile crime is  rising, as is the loss of human lives due to murders, theft, and  threats of revenge for those informing.    As a result of all this, it notes, there is increased  corruption and a growing decline in society's moral level.    The document stresses that, in the regions where poppies and  marijuana are grown, the rural production system is being upset,  because the human and material resources that would normally be  devoted to food production are being diverted to drug growing.    It emphasizes that there is a completely organized  clandestine network for providing seed, credit, and fertilizer;  for technically monitoring planted and fallow fields; for  collecting and distributing all the products; and for involving  the Indian peasants. These drug trafficking networks, and even  the individuals engaged in this trafficking themselves, have  acquired a strong economic, political, and social leadership in  our towns and regions, thus reinforcing our ancestral "cacique"  system.    It admits that, although the drug traffic has major  production and distribution operations on the national  territory, it is primarily a problem with international  dimensions. It is in other countries, such as the United States,  that the drug traffic's main decisionmaking centers operate, and  the largest drug consumer market is located.    The document continues, claiming that very close ties  connect  the drug traffic with violence and arms sales; adding that those  joining it are risking their lives and those of their families.  "Almost every day we hear of murders, to the extent that this  violent situation has become commonplace in some of the  country's towns and regions."    And it cautions: "The extent of this problem reinforces the  hypothesis that it would not be occurring if some authorities  were not involved in drug cultivation, trafficking, and  consumption. On the other hand, this hypothesis is difficult to  prove, because of the furtiveness and cleverness of those  associated with this phenomenon."    It further claims that serious injustices are often  committed  in the campaigns against the drug traffic and drug addiction,  affecting mainly simple peasants, Indians, and poor people.  Because of a small amount of drugs that they produce or carry,  they suffer abuse and spend long periods, even years, in jail,  while the big producers and traffickers usually enjoy impunity.    The document makes this depiction: "Drug consumption has  increased day by day in recent years. It has now reached the  rural areas, where, in the past, drugs were only produced, but  not consumed. It has reached all ages: children, adolescents,  and youths find themselves accosted by drug pushers in the  schools and recreation centers. Unfortunately, very little is  being done to prevent this." [passage omitted]    It adds that the impotence of the isolated groups, even the  national ones, and the willing complicity of certain  authorities, have caused the solution to the drug trafficking  problem to lie in society itself. It is the authorities' duty to  heed the community's outcry and seek legal systems, both  national and international, to provide a timely solution to the  problem, in response to society's just demand.    It does not consider the prosecution of criminals alone to  be  an adequate solution to such a serious problem. It also requires  appreciation and esteem for the values that accompany and  protect life, such as health care, wholesome recreation, family  integration, social coexistence, citizens' participation, and  the development of all the spiritual values, particularly those  related to culture and religion.    Finally, this document encourages all groups and  institutions  that are promoting love for life and nature, and those striving  to help the victims of drug addiction.</p>

			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Bombers target meat trade Three people were yesterday injured by parcel bombs sent to five companies involved in the meat trade. Police believe the attacks were linked and may have been the work of animal rights activists, Jenny Luesby writes. Four bombs exploded yesterday morning in Kent, Gloucestershire, Oxfordshire and Edinburgh, and a fifth was dismantled. Nobody had claimed responsibility for the bombs by yesterday evening. The bombs, which arrived in 12-inch cardboard poster tubes, were sent to two meat-transporting companies, a ferry line that transports animals, a pig breeding company and a chicken breeding plant. Gloucestershire police warned the meat trade to be extra vigilant and to contact police if anything suspicious was spotted. Mr Robin Webb, spokesman for the Animal Liberation Front, said yesterday that he was sure the devices were sent by the Justice Department, a group of animal rights activists. Last year the group sent 13 parcel bombs to scientists and suppliers of animals to laboratories. 'The group appears to concentrate each wave of devices on a specific area of animal abuse,' Mr Webb said. The Research Defence Society, a pressure group drawn from university and commercial laboratories, which says that animals are essential for medical research, has called on Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, to look urgently at the Justice Department group. The group has not yet been publicly identified with any individuals, although police have co-ordinated their efforts to track the group down.</p>

			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / International Company News: Better supply helps Napocor climb strongly Greater reliability of supply led to higher sales and a 567 per cent rise in net profits for the Philippines' state-run National Power Corporation (Napocor) in the first nine months of this year. Last year the country was plagued by regular power cuts of up to 12 hours a day. But since then there have been far fewer breakdowns as the company has achieved reliability of supply and much improved power generation. Yesterday, the company reported net profits of 5.23bn pesos (USDollars 207m) for the nine months. Revenues were up 31 per cent to 37.8bn pesos. Napocor, which still owns most of the country's power-plant capacity, reported an increase of 18 per cent in operating expenses to 28.6bn pesos.</p>

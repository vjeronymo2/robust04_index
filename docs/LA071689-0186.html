			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GROUP DEFIES COURT, STILL FEEDS HOMELESS  </P> <P> The group Food Not Bombs, which refuses to get a permit to distribute food to  the homeless, defied a court order Saturday and resumed serving meals to people  living across from City Hall.  </P> <P> One man was arrested as a breakfast of rice and cereal was given to people who  apparently were camping under the olive trees at Civic Center Plaza, police  said. The resumption of the giveaway came one day after police shut down the  group's food program because it lacked a permit. Officers in riot gear clashed  with activists and some of the homeless and arrested 10 people.  </P></p>

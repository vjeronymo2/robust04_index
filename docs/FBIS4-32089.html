			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Sarajevo, June 19 (AFP) -- Troops of Bosnia's  mainly Moslem army fired on a British UN observation post in  Gorazde, the United Nations said Sunday [19 June] as it reported  a growing number of ceasefire violations. Most of the clashes  are between the Bosnian army and Serb secessionist forces, and  northeastern Bosnia has seen the biggest increase in military  activity over the past three days, UN spokesman Eric Chaperon  said.    However, on Saturday [18 June] night Bosnian army forces  opened fire on a British UN observation post in the eastern  enclave of Gorazde, Chaperon said. The British force fired  back, he added without saying if there were casualties. At dawn  Sunday Bosnian Moslem and Serb forces also clashed in Gorazde,  he added. [passage omitted]    Chaperon said the head of UN forces in Bosnia, General Sir  Michael Rose of Britain, sent a letter Saturday to the  commanders of the Bosnian army and Serb forces asking for strict  observance of the ceasefire. Rose cited incidents in which one  or the other side had broken the truce. [passage omitted]    Chaperon also reported that a Danish UN medical team, due to  travel from Sarajevo to Gorazde, has been stuck in between for  five days at the Serb-held town of Rogatica after refusing to  submit to Serb searches of their equipment.</p>

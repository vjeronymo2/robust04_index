(1) -- A New Snag in Relations"]    [Text] Washington -- Turkish-U.S. relations are entering a  difficult period. Many people in Turkey are not aware of this,  but one must not be surprised if a crisis erupts in the near  future.    The reason for this trend -- the signs of which can be seen  much more clearly here -- is simply the Kurdish problem.    Until now, only Europe raised its voice with regard to this  issue. Reactions, recommendations, and criticism concerning  this matter also emanated from Europe. The United States did  not display much interest or sensitivity.    For some time now, the situation in the southeast, its  terrorism and other aspects, have been creeping onto the U.S.  agenda as well. Especially since the recent incident involving  DEP [Democracy Party] deputies, this issue has begun attracting  attention here in Washington. This subject is debated in the  U.S. Congress; it is discussed at various think tanks as well as  academic institutions; and it is appraised by the press.  Naturally, all the Clinton administration services concerning  the region are following the developments very closely.  Officials from the State and Defense Departments are openly  voicing their displeasure and concern.    In the past, there were a few issues that cast a shadow over  Turkish-U.S. relations, such as the Cyprus and Armenian issues.  These are now in the past. One can now observe an increasing  awareness of the Kurdish problem. There are two reasons for  this. First, the issue has assumed serious proportions in  Turkey. Second, a team that is sensitive to human rights issues  is currently in power in Washington.    These two factors complement one another. If the Democrats  were not in power, the course of events would still have  triggered reaction in Washington. The subject would still have  been discussed in the Congress, at think tanks, and by the  press. In this case, however, the administration does not  hesitate to react. Not because it does not attach importance to  Turkey; and certainly not because it wishes to destabilize or  weaken Turkey.    It is necessary to diagnose the U.S. stand without blindly  creating anti-American feelings and to reach the appropriate  conclusions. Let us realize that this topic will be discussed  more and more extensively in the United States in the coming  weeks and months. Let us also be prepared for developments that  may not please us so much.    The issue will be the subject of criticism and even threats  during the debate in Congress on the aid package for Turkey.    Various activist groups will embrace the subject.    Mrs. Danielle Mitterrand will soon arrive in the United  States to engage in lobbying activities.    Influential U.S. newspapers will follow the developments  more  closely.    A debate conducted in Congress a few days ago was an  indication of the new winds that have begun to blow in  Washington.    Lee Hamilton, chairman of the House of Representatives  Foreign Affairs Subcommittee, expressed his displeasure over the  events in Turkey in reference to the DEP issue and asked for  explanations from Stephan Oxman, U.S. undersecretary of state  who had just returned from contacts in Ankara. Some of Oxman's  remarks clarified the administration's new stand and views.    Let met cite a few examples of Oxman's responses to  Hamilton's questions: "We support Turkey against the PKK  [Workers Party of Kurdistan], but at every opportunity we  advocated a nonmilitary solution... There are many more things  Turkey should do (toward a political solution)... We value  Turkey as an ally, but we also say that this problem cannot be  resolved only through military methods... Unfortunately, DEP  members were punished for expressing their views. This is a  very disturbing development... This gives the people the  message that there is no alternative other than to join the PKK."    During the same session, Hamilton also directed questions at  D. Johnson of the Defense Department: Is Turkey using the  equipment sent to Turkey within the framework of the  supplementary U.S. military aid? Response: " It is using the  Cobra". What is the total amount of this aid? "$121.6 million".    Pointing out that he is not satisfied with these answers,  Hamilton asked to be supplied with all the details. Maybe he  will want to introduce the condition that this aid not be used  in the southeast in the future.    Yes, it is possible that the Clinton administration will  attach certain conditions and restrictions to the $453 million  military aid (in the form of loans) and $100 million economic  aid (in the form of a grant) as well as to the supplementary  weapons and equipment program envisaged for the coming fiscal  year. In other words, at this rate, Washington could warn  Turkey not to use this equipment in the southeast.</p>

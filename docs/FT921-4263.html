			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Europe's ski makers slide toward the black ASK Europe's ski equipment makers if they would prefer a booming economy or snow, and they answer without hesitation. In spite of weak economic conditions in most European countries, Alpine resorts have enjoyed lively business this season and ski equipment makers are seeing the beginning of a welcome recovery from a disastrous slump in the late 1980s. In sharp contrast to the past four winters, the Alps have been blessed with ideal weather conditions for skiing - several heavy snowfalls divided by long sunny spells. The winter olympics in France's Savoy region last month also gave a fillip to the sport. According to the Swiss Tourist Office, the number of bed-nights sold in January was up 5 per cent to 2.6m, with most of the growth attributable to skiers. Visitors from Germany were up 11 per cent, those from Italy up 19 per cent and those from the UK up 16 per cent over last year's levels which were depressed by the Gulf crisis. Worldwide sales of ski equipment look set to grow roughly five per cent, heavily concentrated in Europe. Producers say the Japanese market has calmed down after several strong seasons while the North American market is slumping because of recession and a lack of snow. Salomon, the French equipment maker, is forecasting sales of 5.8m pairs of skis worldwide in the year to March 31, 1992, up 5 per cent from the trough of 5.5m reached in 1990-91, but still well below the 1988-89 peak of 7m pairs. This will be enough to enable the company to make a small profit for the first time in three years. For another French company, Skis Rossignol, the world market leader in skis, a return to profit is not expected until next year, but the group's loss in the year to March 31, 1992 is likely to be only FFr40m, sharply down from FFr140m in the previous year.</p>

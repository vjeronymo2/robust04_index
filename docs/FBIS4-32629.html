			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus by Karel Kriz; </F> place and date not given]    [Text] [Kriz] On 22 June, the government rejected [Deputy  Prime Minister Jan] Kalvoda's draft constitutional law on  forming 13 regions or lands. The resolution adopted recently by  the Civic Democratic Party [ODS] Executive Council, which  envisages that these higher territorial self-administrative  units will evolve from the current districts, also seems to be  rather unviable. What next?    [Klaus] The government has not rejected the proposal for 13  higher territorial units. It has had six alternative proposals  in succession and, in essence, is not ruling out any of them. We  will discuss this issue again on 29 June as the first point on  the agenda regardless of what else is on it. This is a  complicated matter, and it is a great shame that parliament has  "put a lid on it" from above by setting a deadline [for its  submission] before the end of June. There is thus a risk that  we will choose a solution that we will perhaps regret in the  long run. The basic proposition involves parceling out this  country, a unitary state, into a certain number of regions.  This is, in essence, an irreversible intrusion into the state  body of the Czech Republic.    This is such a fundamental change that whoever trivializes  it  and accuses the government of hesitancy, whoever accuses this or  that side of not wanting to resolve the issue, is doing this  country a disservice. As a responsible person, I have to say  that there is one fair conclusion: There is no obvious consensus  in this country on this issue, not only in the government, but  also throughout society. The issue involves whether, in such a  situation, it would not be better to postpone the matter until  this has been settled. It would be the greatest shame if, by  coincidence, only one reason for creating these regions were to  transpire among the coalition partners or the other political  forces in parliament--that it would aggravate the ODS. That  would be a terribly feeble reason, and, unfortunately, I have  the feeling that, when all is said and done, this is the  dominant reason at the moment. The rhetoric of this or that  politician is different, however.    [Kriz] Some politicians are casting doubts on your foreign  policy orientation toward the West...    [Klaus] This seems really extraordinarily amusing to me.  These opinions are being expressed by some Civic Democratic  Alliance [ODA] representatives who seek out every preposterous  pretext so they can attack the ODS and me. The West has a  completely different impression of our stances than the ODA  Central Office.    [Kriz] You have described the 3.5-percent rise in the gross  domestic product in the first quarter of this year as a  "breakthrough." There have been a total of 13 quarters since  the beginning of transformation, however. Of these together,  growth was achieved in five of them, compared with the same  quarter of the previous year. Growth of 3.8 percent was even  achieved in the second quarter of last year. Growth was  recorded in two successive quarters in the second half of 1992.  So, this is nothing new. Therefore, did you use too strong an  expression this time?    [Klaus] We envisaged then that the development in the second  half of 1992 was the start of the growth tendencies. These were  interrupted by the breakup of Czechoslovakia. This prevented  1993 from becoming the first year with plus signs. I think that  the first quarter of 1994 is the beginning, a year later, of  what was indicated in the second half of 1992. I admit that  this trend need not be confirmed in the second quarter of this  year, but there is undoubtedly a general growth tendency here.</p>

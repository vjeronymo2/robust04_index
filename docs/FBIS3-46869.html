The UK is the second biggest donor after Japan at the recent  Paris conference of Vietnam's donors, says a press release made  available here today by the British Embassy.    Speaking to this event, British Ambassador to Vietnam Peter  Williams remarked that the aid pledge shows his government's  regard for the economic performance of the government and people  of Vietnam together with the policies of economic renovation  over the past few years. He stressed the excellent development  of bilateral relations following the highly successful UK visit  by Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet last July.    "The substantial international assistance the Vietnam has  enlisted in the recent donor conference for Vietnam can help the  country move forward to further successes in the future," said  the ambassador. It is known that UK is the second biggest donor  after only Japan at the said Paris conference.

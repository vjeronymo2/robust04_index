			<p><P> October 20, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> TOO EARLY FOR ESTIMATES: LLOYD'S  </P> <P> The head of Lloyd's of London, the world's biggest insurance organization, said  today it was too early to tell how much the Northern California earthquake  would cost its underwriters.  </P> <P> "There are some wild figures being quoted in London, from low to high," Murray  Lawrence told a news conference in Paris. "I don't think there's any real  conception of the total damage."  </P> <P> Insurers at the scene have estimated property damage at $3 billion to $4  billion but the figure was expected to rise as fuller damage reports were  compiled.  </P> <P> Lawrence said much of the damage was to uninsured properties and installations.  Fisherman's Wharf, where buildings were generally of low value, suffered heavy  damage.  </P> <P> "A lot of these buildings are going to take a lot of inspection," Lawrence  said. "They may look all right but some of them may have been damaged in such a  way that it's difficult to estimate it at first sight."  </P></p>

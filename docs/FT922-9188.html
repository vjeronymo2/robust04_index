			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / The Property Market: Docklands get that sinking feeling Two weeks ago, the Isle of Dogs enterprise zone in London's Docklands came of age. But its 10th anniversary, which brought the area's tax holidays to an end, provided little cause for celebration. The towering Canary Wharf development, which has come to symbolise Docklands, is teetering on the brink. The failure of Olympia &amp; York, the Canadian developer which created the project, would seal Dockland's reputation as a developers' graveyard. The area has been visited by the extremes of both success and failure. When, in 1981, Mr Michael Heseltine, the then environment secretary, set up the London Docklands Development Corporation (LDDC) to oversee the regeneration of 20 square miles of derelict land, he described the region in damning terms. 'The area displays more acutely and extensively than any other area in England the physical deterioration of the inner city and the need for urban regeneration,' he said. Six years later, it was dubbed an economic miracle. 'It is seen as the most exceptional development location in the UK and, perhaps, the most dynamic in Europe,' said Mr Reg Ward, chief executive of the LDDC in 1987. At the time, land values had doubled over the previous year, yields had dropped to 5 per cent and the ratio of private investment to public money was 7:1. But five years on, the miracle has turned sour. Docklands is seen as the most costly disaster in the history of UK property development, following a collapse in property values and a glut of vacant property. It is also seen as a planning and architectural disaster. 'London's Docklands contains one of the worst collections of late 20th century buildings to be seen anywhere in the world,' says the Architecture, Design and Technology press, an architectural guide. Around the world, Docklands is seen as an example of how not to regenerate urban areas. It was intended to be a model of what could happen without government interference. But in practice, the government has heavily subsidised the area through tax breaks and infrastructure investment: Pounds 5bn is due to be ploughed into east London's infrastructure by 1995. Moreover, the government may end up bailing out Canary Wharf by building the Jubilee Line railway extension, transferring civil servants to the area and developing the East Thames Corridor. The government's avowed goal was to cut red tape and give private enterprise its head. Yet even the government was surprised by the way matters turned out. The philosophy behind the enterprise zones was to attract industrial development to the area. Instead, the LDDC decided to attract commercial users. 'We used the enterprise zone in a somewhat maverick way by bringing together our totally optimistic aspirations to make the Isle of Dogs an office and commercial location rather than confirming it as a industrial one,' said the LDDC's Mr Ward. Under Mr Ward, a visionary, exuberant and headstrong character, Docklands built up a powerful momentum. Tax breaks, advertising, the light railway, the London City airport and the British Telecom satellite station helped transform the character of the area. The turning point for Docklands  - and with hindsight, its biggest mistake  -was the decision to raise its sights and compete with the City and West End. The potential seemed obvious, however, following the arrival of O&amp;Y, the world's largest property developer, which decided to invest Pounds 3bn in Europe's biggest office scheme. O&amp;Y recognised that London had the most expensive and old fashioned office stock in Europe, which fell a long way short of the aspirations of potential tenants. Tenants wanted large, cheap and high technology offices; the Docklands provided an abundance of cheap, empty land, just 15 minutes away from the City. The logic seemed impeccable. It did not work out as planned. O&amp;Y had to offer generous incentives to tenants; yet 40 per cent of the buildings within Canary Wharf which are complete are still unlet. In part, this reflects the severity of the property recession in London. But to a greater extent, it is a result of London's haphazard approach to its own development. This lack of an overall planning strategy allowed the City of London and surrounding boroughs to relax their own planning controls, creating a glut of space that undermined demand for offices in Docklands. The sheer enormity of the Canary Wharf development put far too much strain on existing infrastructure and improvements, such as better transportation, came far too late. As a result, the image of the area was tarnished and Canary Wharf failed to attract any big UK companies. The Docklands experiment failed in other ways, too. It was launched in the teeth of hostility from neighbouring local authorities, and it inspired intense opposition from the local community. This was highlighted by a Pounds 100m law suit from local residents against O&amp;Y and the LDDC because of the noise, dust, dirt and disruption from the construction works. To its critics, Docklands demonstrates the flaw in the Conservative party's philosophy of urban regeneration. 'It is a fundamentally flawed approach,' says Mr Bob Colenutt of the Docklands Consultative Committee (DCC), a local authority association. The benefits of developments in Docklands have yet to trickle down to the local community, he adds. Three quarters of the jobs in the enterprise zone have simply involved relocation of jobs from other parts of London; in total the enterprise zone has resulted in the creation of just 2,733 jobs, says the DCC. Assuming the cost of tax breaks and infrastructure totals Pounds 2.9bn - according to the LDDC  - the DCC calculates that the government will have spent more than Pounds 1m for every new job in the Isle of Dogs enterprise zone. The LDDC, however, says that the costs of the enterprise zone have been exaggerated and, furthermore, it is proud of its employment record: between 1981 and 1992 unemployment within the development area increased by 33 per cent; in Greater London as a whole unemployment has increased by 47 per cent over the same period. Opinions differ on the future of Docklands. A substantial, albeit biased, section of the property industry thinks it should scale back its ambitions and settle for being a cheap location for clerks and computer installations. 'It should be like Croydon or Hammersmith,' says one consultant. The problems of O&amp;Y, which may well result in the cancellation of the Jubilee Line extension and the end of more development at Canary Wharf, make this outcome likely. The DCC thinks Docklands should concentrate on more modest development including the allocation of half the Royal Docks for social housing. 'The fantastic visions of the 1980s have to be reassessed,' says Mr Colenutt. But the LDDC refuses to amend its plans, arguing that the DCC's ideas would merely accelerate the spiral of decline. The LDDC sees the recession as a chance to catch up on the development of infrastructure, which should finally be in place when the UK economy picks up. 'London needs Docklands to enable it to remain one of the world's top three cities,' says Mr Michael Pickard, chairman of the LDDC. 'Why should we not be able to compete with the City of London and the City of Westminster?' asks Mr Eric Sorensen, chief executive of the LDDC. 'Docklands will have important advantages in its communications,' he adds, citing the following important additions: a broad highway running from the City to the Royal Docks will be completed by the summer of 1993, coinciding with the expansion and upgrading of the Docklands light railway. The government's belief was that it could not justify building roads and tube lines across wasteland. Its policy of no subsidies and no infrastructure gradually turned into one of subsidies and infrastructure. The message of the Docklands enterprise zone simply underlines what the property industry always knew: infrastructure is the key to development.</p>

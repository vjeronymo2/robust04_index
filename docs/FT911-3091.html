			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / UK Company News: Etam falls 51% to Pounds 8.5m but holds final dividend at 4.65p ETAM, the clothing retailer which has been approached by the investment vehicle of a South African family, suffered a 51 per cent fall in pre-tax profits in the year to January 26. The taxable figure of Pounds 8.5m (Pounds 17.5m) came after a first-half loss of Pounds 1.1m. After two dividend cuts in the past 12 months, the final is maintained at 4.65p, for a total of 5.85p (6.6p). The better-than-expected news initially drove up the share price by about 10p. It closed 2p ahead at 162p. Since the beginning of February, when Oceana Investment Corporation made a draft proposal to obtain more than 50 per cent of the shares, the price has recovered from less than 100p, outperforming the market by 43 per cent before yesterday's rise. Etam, which rebuffed the approach, said the Takeover Panel had ruled that it was in an offer period. Oceana, controlled by the Lewis family, has a 6.6 per cent stake. Etam's pre-tax figure was the worst since 1983-84 and the dividend was only 1.3 times covered by earnings per share of 7.51p (16.7p). Turnover continued to grow to Pounds 206.5m (Pounds 181.2m), a 14 per cent increase; but profit before interest fell by 37 per cent to Pounds 10.5m (Pounds 16.8m) in spite of an Pounds 870,000 benefit from a change in depreciation policy. Although Pounds 1.3m (Pounds 1.8m) cash was held in January, debt peaked at nearly Pounds 15m and Pounds 1m interest charges replaced Pounds 640,000 income. Rationalisation costs of Pounds 1m were also taken above the line. A four-year expansion programme that increased shop floorspace by 60 per cent to 860,000 sq ft and the number of outlets to about 250 was completed by the middle of the year. Mr Rodney East, chief executive, said the large amount of new space had put pressure on costs, which were also pushed up by rents, rates and wages. Mr Keith Miles, finance director, said the poll tax and high mortgage rates had hit its customers, traditionally younger women in the C1/C2 social group. In response to the decrease in the number of 15 to 25-year-olds, the group was moving down as far as five-year-olds with its Tammy Girl range and up to 35-year-olds at its Etam shops, which account for more than 60 per cent of the business. Of the two 1987 acquisitions, Snob was making a useful contribution from its teenage base, but Peter Brown, the menswear chain, incurred a loss. COMMENT Pity the investor who bought shares at 319p in the July 1987 placing which raised Pounds 34m. Between then and last October's low of 60p, the shares underperformed the market by 77 per cent. Over the past four years Etam has invested Pounds 78m, against depreciation of Pounds 29m, more than doubled its floor space and increased turnover by more than 80 per cent. But pre-tax profit has fallen to less than half the record Pounds 17.9m made in 1987-88. The group must, however, be given credit for dragging itself out of the first-half mire, even if a little of the gloss is put down to defensive moves against Oceana. This year it should benefit from cost savings, the elimination of losses and a lower interest charge. Even a modest increase in sales should have a favourable impact on the bottom line. Pre-tax profit forecasts range from Pounds 10m to Pounds 13m, giving a prospective p/e of between 13 and 16. That rating has as much to do with bid speculation as with recovery potential.</p>

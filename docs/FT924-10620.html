			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / It's aloha to four sure votes for Clinton: Hawaii's islands in the sun are assessed by a Special Correspondent in Honolulu THE DEMOCRATIC Party is as much a part of the scenery as surfers and palm trees in this Pacific outpost of US politics. That the Democrats' presidential candidate, Mr Bill Clinton, will win in the archipelago has long been reckoned a a virtual certainty, so much so that neither he nor President George Bush has campaigned here. Indeed, no presidential candidate has kissed Hawaii's babies since 1960, when Vice-President Richard Nixon made the trip during the 50th state's first national election. He lost the presidential race that year to John F. Kennedy. 'If the Republicans are going to win Hawaii, well, they're going to win anyway,' a Republican party official said. Hawaii has just four of the nation's 538 electoral college votes, and the odds against those few votes being decisive are long. The state has deviated from the Democrats only as part of national landslides for incumbents: Nixon in 1972, Ronald Reagan in 1984. Mr Clinton's wife Hillary and daughter Chelsea made a campaign stop in August, en route to an island vacation. They were met, floral leis in hand of course, by Governor John Waihee. He is rumoured to be on the Clinton list of cabinet potentials. Mrs Marilyn Quayle, wife of Vice-President Dan Quayle, came in September, but only to see the aftermath of Hurricane Iniki as an advisory board member of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. She made no campaign appearances. All four members of the state's delegation in Congress are Democrats; none of the three up for re-election faces a real challenge. One ot the state's two US senators, Mr Daniel Inouye, is running for his sixth six-year term. Allegations that he pressed his barber into bed with him 17 years ago, and has sexually harassed her since, only seemed to discredit state senator Rick Reed, the Republican challenger who publicised the woman's story. She said she was tape-recorded secretly by a former Reed campaigner. Mr Inouye denied the allegations, and local Republicans raced to distance themselves from Mr Reed's advertisements. However, the Republicans have not always been on the outside looking in. Before statehood was achieved in 1959, they dominated what was a federal territory with power inherited from missionaries and plantation owners. But the legacy turned into a burden, as their party came to be perceived as elitist. Plantation labourers, and their children and grandchildren now working in hotels, have opted for their alternative. Hawaii residents, along with many other Americans, are also looking for change. The national recession has blown ill trade winds for the state's biggest moneymaker, the Dollars 9.9bn tourism industry. This year's count of visitors is expected to drop by 4-7 per cent from that of last year, according to the Hawaii Visitors Bureau. The state, long a big social spender, is fumbling with budget cuts. Its 1992-93 budget of Dollars 2.8bn was based on projected overall growth of 1.1 per cent, but that has been sliced to 0.4 per cent.</p>

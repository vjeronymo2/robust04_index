			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Construction Contracts: Pounds 50m Teesside development Solid foundations are being laid by Tarmac for a Pounds 50m scheme to bring new leisure and business interests to Teesside and the north east. A total of 15,000 cu metres of reinforced concrete is being pumped into the 'dry' bed of the diverted River Tees for the base of the Tees Barrage, being built by TARMAC CONSTRUCTION for Teesside Development Corporation. The barrage, 70 metres wide and 50 metres long, is a key project in the Corporation's regeneration of 19 sq miles of derelict land. The barrage at Blue House Point, Stockton, will create 12 miles of clean navigable waterway upstream for sporting and recreational activities, and access to newly-established commercial areas. Other amenities and leisure facilities in the barrage project include a canoe slalom, navigation waterway and lock, a fish pass, cafeteria and a caravan park. The foundation work will be completed in July ready for the erection of the bridge over the barrage structure. The bridge comprises 700 tons of tubular steel and 64 circular one and a half tonne castings which are being manufactured locally. The river will be rediverted at the end of September to allow the temporary diversion to be filled in and the navigation channel to be constructed. Installed between the piers of the barrage substructure will be four fishbelly gates, each weighing 50 tons, and measuring 13.5 metres long and eight metres high. The gates will regulate the flow of river water and also act as a barrier to prevent tidal flooding upstream. The barrage is being designed to work automatically and will be commissioned in October 1994.</p>

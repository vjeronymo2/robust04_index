This year, the  Guangxi Government will continue to crack down severely on drug  smuggling and trafficking in close cooperation with the Hong  Kong police. [passage omitted]    Guangxi leaders made these remarks at today's "News  Conference on Guangxi's Reform, Opening up, and Economic  Development." When answering a Hong Kong reporter's question,  Lei Yu said: Guangxi shares a 1,025-km land frontier and  1,595-km coastline with its neighboring countries. Making use  of this long frontier and coastline, many lawless elements carry  out gunrunning and drug trafficking. The Guangxi Government has  always adopted severe measures to deal with lawless elements.  Last year, the government boosted the police force by 700  personnel to specially cope with gunrunners and drug traffickers  and seized more than 10 kg of heroin, some 800 kg of opium, and  about 300 guns (mostly smuggled in from outside the borders),  and arrested over 300 smugglers (mostly members of gangs  comprising several persons). The Guangxi leader went on to say:  We have always maintained close coordination with the Hong Kong  police. This has been the case in the past and it will remain  unchanged in the days to come.

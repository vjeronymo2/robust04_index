			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Council to target inward investors NORTHUMBERLAND County Council is to use its super-annuation fund investments as a means of trying to attract potential inward investors to its area. About 50 per cent of the Pounds 250m fund is invested in UK equities, with another 20 per cent in equity stakes in companies in north America, Europe, Japan and the Pacific Basin. The council is now to target some of these businesses, inviting them to consider the county as a base. Mr Ken Morris, its chief executive, said yesterday: 'That relationship is a powerful calling-card. It's much easier to knock on the door of a potential investor as a shareholder than as a salesman.' The initiative, he said, would not influence the fund's investment policy, which is to try to secure the best possible return. Mr Morris said the council would not invest in companies in order to encourage them to locate in Northumberland. The council will target companies in pharmaceuticals, electronics, engineering and automotive supply. Its fund managers, Barings Investment Management and Mercury Asset Management, are to identify businesses with growth potential in these sectors among its existing equity investments. Council economic development officers will then approach the companies.</p>

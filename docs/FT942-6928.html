			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Tunstall ahead to Pounds 3.28m and seeks expansion Tunstall Group, market leader in emergency communication systems for the elderly, raised pre-tax profits from Pounds 3.17m to Pounds 3.28m in the six months to end-March. Turnover increased from Pounds 22.2m to Pounds 23.3m, including Pounds 658,000 from the Dutch subsidiary acquired last October, which contributed Pounds 84,000 to profit. Describing the results as 'extremely good', Mr Michael Dawson, chairman, said prospects for the full year were encouraging with the order book for the core business 17 per cent up on the same period last year. The group, which also makes security systems and has a contract electronics manufacturing arm, increased direct exports from the UK by 42 per cent to Pounds 1.7m. The total overseas contribution to sales eased to Pounds 4.4m, held back by tough trading conditions in Germany. The profit also included Pounds 63,000 from associates - distribution companies in Spain, Norway and Australia where the group sees significant opportunities for expansion. Capital expenditure at Pounds 2.6m equalled last year and is expected to have doubled by the end of 1994. Mr Dawson said that by the end of 1996 the contract electronics division, known as Mion, would employ 600 people and contribute Pounds 25m to group turnover. The damages case against Anchor Line over the 1988 acquisition of Tann-Synchronome begins next month. Legal costs, which by the end of March amounted to Pounds 454,000, have been written off as incurred. Earnings per share rose from 6.6p to 7p. The interim dividend is raised from 1.25p to 1.35p.</p>

			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Classical music sales fall sharply Sales of classical music albums have fallen sharply in recent years, according to figures in the Policy Studies Institute's yearly Cultural Trends, published today. Trade deliveries of classical albums totalled 12.35m last year, 26 per cent less than the 16.688m despatched in 1990. Classical albums made up only 9.2 per cent of deliveries last year - after two years at over 10 per cent. The new issue of Cultural Trends underlines the virtual disappearance of vinyl LPs. In 1985, half the deliveries to the retail trade (excluding singles) were LPs. By last year that had fallen to just 3.9 per cent. In the same period, deliveries of CDs rose from 6.6 per cent to 62.2 per cent. Cassettes fell from 43.8 per cent to 33.9 per cent. Expenditure on recorded music has been hit by the recession, falling from Pounds 1.27bn in 1989 to Pounds 1.243bn last year, in spite of the high price of CDs. Spending on hardware has dropped in line, from Pounds 942m to Pounds 895m.</p>

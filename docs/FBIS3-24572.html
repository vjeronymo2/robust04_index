			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V. S. Pondarev; UDC 620.179:621373] </F>   [Abstract] Interference methods and results of computing  interference contrast and the corresponding errors in light  reading in the case of a scalar wave field, depending on the  characteristic of the entirely coherent low-order Gaussian beam  are discussed in this article. It is assumed that the Fresnel  coefficients are invariant and that the reflection from an  inclined angle of incidence on the edge of the sample produces  no phase shifting. Results of numerical computations for  semi-conductor plates are provided. It is demonstrated that the  interference intensity in the examined case is determined by a  particular thickness of the plate and its effective coefficient  of reflection. Curves of the interference contrast as a function  of the sample thickness for different values of the effective  reflection coefficient, and the relationship between the maximum  relative light reading error and light transmissions by the  plate were obtained.

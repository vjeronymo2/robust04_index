			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Regarding David Boatman's complaint about the inane banter between Kelly Lange  and Fritz Coleman and the others on the 6 p.m. news on KNBC, I have no  objection to that innocent banter. However, I do object most strenuously to  having a weatherman who wants to be a comedian and insists on interjecting  comedy in his weather report. If Coleman wants to be a comedian, he should  concentrate his efforts on being a comedian. If he wants to be a weather  reporter, he should concentrate on being a weather reporter. But he should not  try to be both at the same time. He should not be allowed to force his alleged  comedic talents on the people who just want to hear the news and weather  without the comedy.  </P> <P> Howard Longman, Temple City  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 27, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GIVE 'INDEPENDENT VERDICT,' MCMARTIN LAWYER ASKS JURORS;  </P> <P> TRIAL: IN HIS FINAL ARGUMENT IN A LENGTHY CASE, A DEFENSE ATTORNEY WARNS OF  'MEDICAL EVIDENCE THAT MAY HAVE BEEN FABRICATED.'  </P> <P> Six years since the first arrest in the McMartin Pre-School molestation case,  the defense spoke for the last time in court Thursday, asking the jury to "keep  your health and keep your head and keep on the case -- and please give both  sides your fair, objective and independent verdict."  </P> <P> Forcefully winding up 5 1/2 days of final arguments, lawyer Danny Davis, who  represents defendant Ray Buckey, attacked the integrity of the prosecution for  its use of a jailhouse informant and for allegedly shaping children's  testimony. He characterized the case as based on "insinuendos" and "unreliable  medical evidence that may have been fabricated."  </P> <P> "If we find that it was (symptoms of) diarrhea (rather than molestation) and  Manhattan Beach went berserk," triggering the longest and costliest criminal  case in world history, he said, then "the horror that this case is a sham is  absolutely numbing."  </P> <P> The lawyer was referring to the 2 1/2-year-old boy whose mother, now dead, made  the first complaint against "Mr. Ray" in 1983.  </P> <P> As a result, Manhattan Beach police sent parents a form letter about the  investigation that created hysteria, resulting in charges being filed against  the founder and six other teachers at the family owned nursery school and the  closure of nine area preschools.  </P> <P> Davis argued that the prosecution had failed to prove "beyond a reasonable  doubt" that the alleged crimes occurred or, if they did, that they were  committed by his client and they fell within the six-year period covered by the  statute of limitations.  </P> <P> He urged the eight-man, four-woman jury to give Buckey "the benefit of the  doubt."  </P> <P> Buckey, now 31, and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, 62, are charged with 65  counts of molestation and conspiracy involving 11 children, nine of whom  testified against them.  </P> <P> Charges against the other five defendants were dropped by the district  attorney's office for insufficient evidence, despite a preliminary hearing  judge's finding that all should stand trial.  </P> <P> After one day of final arguments by lawyer Dean Gits, who represents Peggy  McMartin Buckey, Davis used the remaining 5 1/2 days allotted to the defense by  Los Angeles Superior Court Judge William Pounders in an attempt to refute the  allegations, examining the evidence child by child and count by count.  </P> <P> Davis said the allegations are "defined, impossible, unreal occurrences" that  for the most part would have had to happen either when his client was not at  the seaside nursery school or with the knowledge of the other teachers, all of  whom testified that they observed nothing even remotely suspicious.  </P> <P> The defense lawyer said the "lovely, rehearsed" children appeared to have  memorized their testimony after suggestive interviews by therapists and  coaching by the prosecution. And he told the panel if they believe the  witnesses' accounts of molestation they will also have to accept their bizarre  tales of abuse in a carwash and grocery, and of animal mutilation and  satanic-like rituals.  </P> <P> "You can still love children and want to believe them, but you cannot rely on  their testimony," he contended.  </P> <P> Earlier, Davis warned jurors not to get caught up in the present-day  "children's movement" by making his client "a scapegoat." He compared the  McMartin case to the Salem witch trials and the McCarthy hearings, both of  which punished innocent people.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Lael Rubin will have the last word. The prosecution has  saved 3 1/2 days of its allotted time for her closing arguments, beginning  today.  </P> <P> The case will go to the jury next week.  </P></p>

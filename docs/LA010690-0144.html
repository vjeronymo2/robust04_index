			<p><P> January 6, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ROOTERS GOING THE DISTANCE FOR RAMS  </P> <P> There are fans of the Los Angeles Rams football team. And then there are folks  like Ron Lais and Joan Ann Faria.  </P> <P> Lais, with his wife and son, and Faria climbed on a plane at Los Angeles  International Airport on Friday and flew to that flower among American cities  -- Newark, N.J. All for the chance to sit in a stadium built on a former  garbage dump, a stadium where Jimmy Hoffa may be buried, a stadium where the  wind roars in winter like it's turbocharged -- even when it doesn't snow. And  all so they can root for their Rams in a playoff game Sunday against the New  York Giants.  </P> <P> (Yes, the New York Giants do happen to play in New Jersey, a whole 'nother  state. But then the Los Angeles Rams do happen to play in Anaheim, a whole  'nother city in a whole 'nother county.)  </P> <P> "I'm so excited my stomach hurts," Faria said before boarding the plane. "I  have been a devout Rams fan for 30 years . . . and finally I've got enough  money saved up that I can see them," even if it means flying across the  country.  </P> <P> Lais, a Santa Ana lawyer who lives in Anaheim Hills, figures that if there is  such a thing as "Rams Fever" these days, "I've probably got it about as bad as  anybody."  </P> <P> Lais said the flight, football tickets and hotel not far from the stadium cost  $500 per person. The Laises, Faria and three others are part of a contingent of  seven Rams Booster Club members journeying east for the game.  </P> <P> Jim Ort, president of All-Travel Service in Anaheim and a charter member of the  booster group, packaged the weekend journey. He said he could have picked up  more tickets but many people are looking beyond the Meadowlands, to San  Francisco or Minneapolis-St. Paul, and to New Orleans. If the Rams win Sunday,  they go to San Francisco or Minnesota next weekend to play the winner of  today's game between the Vikings and the 49ers. Should the Rams win again, they  go to the city of jazz and jambalaya for the Super Bowl.  </P> <P> "I think a lot of people are enthused, but I also think a certain amount of  them believe the Rams are going all the way and are saving their money for the  Super Bowl in New Orleans," Ort said. He's skipping the trip because he's  installing a new computer system in his office.  </P> <P> But those who stay in Orange County won't be far from a television set Sunday  morning.  </P> <P> "I'm going to be at home, and I've invited our kids over and have a quick  little brunch after it's completed," said Supervisor Don R. Roth, a former  Anaheim mayor, sports buff and occasional occupant of the Anaheim Stadium box  of Rams owner Georgia Frontiere.  </P> <P> Businessman John Crean and his wife, Donna, are having a group of two dozen or  so over to their new home that's still being built in Santa Ana Heights,  according to Lois Lundberg, who is organizing the party for the Creans.  </P> <P> The key to wangling an invitation, Lundberg said, "is you have to be a great  Rams fan. You have to do a lot of cheering."  </P> <P> The Crean home, overlooking the Back Bay, will have 45,000 square feet when  it's done and will sport its own movie theater, which will be the site for  Sunday's game-watchers.  </P> <P> Crean "is frequently in Georgia's box cheering the Rams when they're in Los  Angeles so he's doing his part while they're going to New York," Lundberg said.  </P> <P> Rams Booster Club members are expected to get together at a Garden Grove  restaurant to view the game, according to the club's executive director, Mary  Jane Stratman. In fact, the restaurant is opening early because the game starts  at 9:30 a.m.  </P> <P> Stratman said the club has 1,800 members, who pay $25 per person or $40 per  couple to belong. The club has a newsletter, tailgate parties at Anaheim  stadium, a breakfast with Coach John Robinson, a dinner-dance with the Ram  coaching staff, a picnic and a golf tournament that raises funds for county  charities each year.  </P> <P> Then there are the road trips.  </P> <P> Especially to New Orleans.  </P> <P> "We just got done taking 210 (people) to New Orleans," Ort said. "After the  Rams won that game, at around midnight, with our (Rams) banner and the Ram  horns, we marched down Bourbon Street from one end to the other and into Pat  O'Brien's, where we asked if they had a table for 200. . . . We celebrated the  victory while the Rams were on their way home in the plane."  </P> <P> Lais was part of the crowd in New Orleans for the Nov. 26 Rams game. He went to  San Francisco too. And Chicago.  </P> <P> He said there have been occasions when he has flown his own plane to Knoxville,  Tenn., and to Norman, Okla., to watch USC play. But he didn't go to a Rams game  until they moved to Anaheim 10 years ago.  </P> <P> Now the Rams have inspired him to go to New York for the first time in 34 years  -- despite some concerns about the legendary New York-area fans.  </P> <P> "My daughters performed a few years ago at Shea Stadium at halftime" of a Jets  football game, Lais said. "They were in a drill team, and I guess they had to  have a lot of security because people were so crazy, tipping over the buses and  weird stuff." As a result, Lais figured he will "maintain a relatively low  profile" at the stadium.  </P> <P> Faria, who works as a "professional temporary . . . (helping) people organize  their businesses," said she has a New York native now working in her Long Beach  office who "is about ready to choke me" because of her football loyalties.  "Every time he comes in he hits me.  </P> <P> "We'll have a fabulous time," she said before takeoff. "It's just too  exciting."  </P> <P> But won't it be cold?  </P> <P> "I have a mink coat that I never get to wear. And I'm wearing my mink coat. And  my ski suit." Not to the game, but into Manhattan.  </P> <P> Across the river from the stadium, on Central Park South, Rams spokesman  Marshall Klein said from his hotel room that although some of Frontiere's  friends had traveled to the game, "I wouldn't say chartered airliners are being  loaded up" with Rams rooters.  </P> <P> Still, "obviously, Mrs. Frontiere is thrilled as she can be with the  performance of her team. . . . It's been quite a season for all of us.  </P> <P> "We would love to have just two more cracks and be there Jan. 28 in New  Orleans," Klein said.  </P> <P> If it happens, said Klein and Ort and Stratman and Lais and Faria, then you'll  really see Rams fever.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Beirut correspondent Muhammad Bishkar] </F>   [Text] The outcome of the Geneva summit yesterday between  Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad and U.S. President Bill Clinton  has created the impression that what took place was a discussion  of broad matters and that the summit never touched on the minute  details which confuse the Middle East's problems. Such details  were left for committees and subcommittees and for the two  countries' foreign ministers. This means that the  implementation of what has been agreed upon will take a long  time, and this in itself dampens the hopes of Arabs and  non-Arabs who are in a hurry to normalize ties with Israel and  make peace with that country.    The United States said what it wanted through its president,  and the Syrian president said what he wanted, but what the two  sides desire do not concur in substance, although the U.S. media  tried to show superficial agreement between the two presidents  at the Geneva summit.    The problem with the United States is that it is not neutral  in the conflict with the Zionist state but is supportive of this  state in political, economical, and security areas. The United  States' aim in the peace process, which was launched in Madrid  over two years ago, is only to perpetuate Israel's strength on  all levels at the expense of Arabs and Muslims. This obvious  U.S. stance, which has been manifested numerous times in U.S.  policy on the region, is alone capable of undermining the peace  process if the opposite side is the Syrian stance that  contradicts the aims of U.S. policy in the region.    As for Israel, where U.S. envoy Dennis Ross rushed to convey  Clinton's assurances to its officials a few hours after the  Syrian-U.S. summit, it is practically sure of the U.S.  Administration's intentions toward it and of Washington's policy  that gives it an important role in the Middle East's leadership.  Israel does not object to agreeing with Syria and other Arab  countries to normalize diplomatic, economic, and even social  ties. But so far it is not ready to give the Arabs any  (?concession), not in terms of land, security, or economics.    If anything, the Geneva summit shows the United States'  extreme concern to make the region's settlement process a  success in line with its own interests and domination of the  region's resources and wealth.</p>

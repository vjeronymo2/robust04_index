			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Letter: A waste - but what type? Sir, June 30 saw the last of the old 10p coin or florin as legal tender. Large stocks of these now-surplus coins are to be recycled usefully at the Royal Mint at Llantrisant. It would greatly assist the traditional metal recycling industry, regulators, law makers of the UK and EC and Greenpeace et al to identify the precise point of the coins' metamorphic change. Presumably July 1 saw an overnight transformation of one's pocket contents to become: controlled waste under the Environmental Protection Act 1990; or secondary raw material or product to be melted by the Royal Mint and others; or hazardous waste whose movement is subject to trans-frontier waste controls or total restriction recommended by Greenpeace; or heavy metal and therefore toxic, on the basis of copper and nickel content. Clear direction to confused industries and regulators is required to promote investment and encouragement of basic recycling operations. The common sense acquired to see that 'two bob' is 'two bob' must not be thrown away through lack of knowledge of what made 'two bob' worth something to begin with.

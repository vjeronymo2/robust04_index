			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE SPOTLIGHT  </P> <P> Robby Cook: Moorpark  </P> <P> Wrestling: 142 pounds  </P> <P> Sophomore: 5-foot-7  </P> <P> The technical term for the move is a lateral drop, but in layman's language,  Robby Cook's takedown in the waning seconds of his semifinal match was simply  an enormous turnaround for Moorpark College's wrestling team in last week's  state junior college championships.  </P> <P> Trailing, 10-5, with seven seconds remaining, Cook took Fresno City's Ralph  Olivas down for two points and then segued into a three-point near-fall to tie  the score before time expired.  </P> <P> Cook won, 12-10, in overtime.  </P> <P> "It was the Hail Mary throw," Moorpark Coach John Keever said. "There's no  question it won the state meet for us."  </P> <P> Moorpark and Fresno were battling for the team lead at the time, and Keever  estimated that Cook's win provided a 20-point turnaround. Cook went on to win  the title at 142 pounds.  </P></p>

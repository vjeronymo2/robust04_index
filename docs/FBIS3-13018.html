It primarily presupposes the establishment of safe areas  in southern Sudan, the intervention of foreign forces, and the  imposition of an air, economic, oil, and military embargo on  Khartoum in preparation for an entry by the opposition forces,  which are currently deployed in one of the neighboring  countries, to overpower the regime. But the opposition  "al-Ummah" Party has doubts about this plan's success.    In a telephone interview with AL-SAFIR, opposition sources  in  London said that forces belonging to one of the "northern"  opposition parties are now deployed all along Sudan's borders  with one of its neighboring countries, which recently became  embroiled in a dispute with Khartoum after accusing the  al-Bashir government of harboring and supporting opposition  groups from that country.    The sources, which declined to reveal their identity, added  that a meeting of the Sudanese opposition parties in the British  House of Lords late last week sponsored by Baroness Caroline Cox  had called on the international community to establish "safe  areas" in southern Sudan and to impose an air, economic,  military, and oil embargo on Khartoum that would weaken  al-Bashir's government enough to allow the opposition to enter  the capital and remove the regime.    The sources explained that the safe areas to be established  would not only include southern areas (that is the provinces of  Bahr al-Ghazal, Upper Nile, and Equatoria) but would be extended  to include what is known as the disputed "ravaged areas," on  which there is no agreement yet as to whether they are  "southern" or "northern". Some of these include parts of the  provinces of Darfur, Kordofan (Jabal al-Nuba), and al-Anqasta.  This means reducing the borders of the northern area to a  minimum.    The sources went on to say that a simultaneous declaration  of  an embargo on Khartoum would tighten the noose around the  al-Bashir government, together with the closure of the borders  with Libya and Chad and even Egypt, the closure of Port Sudan's  harbor, and the isolation of the present government. This would  allow the opposition forces inside the country to act, lead to  an army revolt, and pave the way for the entry of the opposition  forces from outside.    The sources admitted that the stage that will follow this  remains vague because the opposition parties have not yet agreed  on the type of regime or the fate of the south, in addition to  the absence of any party or figure capable of rallying the  masses or possessing a specific program for taking over  authority and managing the country in a transitional period.    But deputy leader of al-Ummah Party Nasir-al-Din al-Mahdi  has  doubts about the likelihood of getting a resolution from the UN  Security Council setting up safe areas and imposing an embargo  on Khartoum. He noted that he senses that the British  Government is hesistant about this matter.    Al-Mahdi said that the London meeting was held at the House  of Lords at the invitation of the House to the opposition to  come and explain its stands on the current political situation  in Khartoum, the right to self-determination in the south, the  conditions of refugees and displaced persons, and other Sudanese  issues.    Speaking to AL-SAFIR from London, al-Mahdi said that "the  original aim of the meeting was to urge a halt to the war in the  south, provide the necessary relief and support for the refugees  and displaced persons, notify Khartoum of the gravity of its  repressive practices, and deter it by appealing to the  international community."    Al-Mahdi believes that the meeting's call for "setting up  safe corridors in the war-stricken area, imposing an arms ban on  the Sudanese Army and an oil embargo and economic sanctions on  Sudan, defining a military no-fly zone, appointing a resident  assistant commissioner for human rights in Khartoum, and  suspending Sudan's membership in international and regional  organizations" was more an appeal than a call.    He admitted that the issue of the right to  self-determination  in the south has created controversy and that the opposition has  failed to reach agreement on it. "No one can say he is  authorized to raise this issue, not even the southern parties,  who do not represent all southerners, particularly since most of  them do not live in the south," he said.    Al-Mahdi expects "an escalation of opposition activity  inside  Sudan by the Sudanese people as a prologue to deposing the  government soon after its failure becomes clear. He believes it  is likely that "the regime's international isolation will  increase through the imposition of more economic sanctions."    He said that the campaign the Sudanese Army is currently  conducting against the rebels--a campaign that Khartoum denies--  "will fail because, at best, government troops will control the  main roads but not the cities." He believes that this failure  will create a state of discontent in the Army's ranks and might  lead to a mutiny. He is convinced that "the internal situation  will soon explode."    Al-Mahdi admitted that the opposition abroad is weak and  "ineffective," particularly because of the differences among the  various sectors. "We are trying to draw the attention of the  opposition abroad to the need to focus on major issues, like  deposing the regime and drawing up a program for the  post-al-Bashir era," he said. He added: "But this opposition  might not be able to do much. The Sudanese are not too wrong  when they call it the 'hotel opposition.'"    He added: "This opposition will continue to be a hotel one  if  its internal differences persist. The Sudanese people do not  expect much of it. They even call on us to stay abroad."    The London meeting included Muhammad 'Uthman al-Mirghani,  the  leader of the Democratic Unionist Party; 'Umar Nur-al-Da'im, the  secretary general of the al-Ummah party, which is led by  Al-Sadiq al-Mahdi; 'Izz-al-Din 'Ali 'Amir, a leading cadre in  the Communist Party representatives of the two rebel wings; Amin  Makki Madani, the chairman of the Sudanese Human Rights  Organization; plus 35 Sudanese figures.    The conferees differed on the future of the south.  Representatives of the John Garang-led Sudanese People's  Liberation Army [SPLA] said: "Here we are divided into  northerners and southerners on the issue of self-determination."    Sources who participated in the meeting say that although  most of the northern parties may not object in principle to  granting self-determination for the southerners, they cannot  risk losing the northerners' support for them by admitting that.    The only party that boycotted the London meeting was the  opposition National Organization for the Independent Sudanese  Forces. This organization released a statement in London saying  that "the great interest shown by some Western governments,  organizations, and media in the war and famine in southern Sudan  raises many fears and misgivings in a large sector of the  Sudanese people."  The statement summarizes these fears, saying that "although  tragic, the situation in southern Sudan does not differ from  more tragic situations in numerous regions in Africa and other  parts of the world that have not received similar attention, not  to mention that these situations have met with procrastination  and negligence by the West."    The statement adds: "This concern coincides with the  proposed Western political plans regarding the problem of the  south and with a call for international intervention to set up  so-called safe havens in some parts of Sudan. This smacks of a  plan to partition Sudan and separate the south."    The state went on: "There is a clear link between the change  in the balance of power between the warring sides and the timing  of the Western governments and organizations raising the issue  of famine and human rights. This reflects the existence of  political motives behind this campaign and the West's bias  toward a certain party."    Western countries, led by the United States and Britain,  indeed began a political and propaganda campaign in recent  months focusing on the situation in southern Sudan "which has  not changed since 1983." The campaign has also focused on the  need to set up safe havens in the south on the pretext of  insuring the delivery of relief aid to the population.    Recent reports from southern Sudan indicate that government  forces have advanced in the main areas of the south.    The statement disputes the right of the parties taking part  in the London meeting to "speak in the name of the Sudanese  people" and also denies that these parties' viewpoint is  representative .    Replying to a question about the Sudanese opposition's  request for an embargo on their country, which the Sudanese  people would suffer from, the opposition sources which took part  in the London meeting said "The Sudanese nation already suffers  from the current situation; an embargo would not increase their  suffering."    The sources rejected any resemblance between the current  Iraqi situation and the future situation of Sudan if an embargo  is imposed on it. The sources said that the al-Bashir  government "has begun to crumble and an embargo will only  expedite its departure." They expected the embargo not to last  more than five months, after which the opposition forces would  be able to enter Khartoum.    The sources disclosed that the original plan aimed to set up  safe havens in the south and proclaim the formation of a  provisional government in Juba with the objective of toppling  the al-Bashir government and advancing north after an  international embargo had been imposed on Khartoum.    The sources explained that the recent disagreement between  Khartoum and a neighboring country allowed for the revision of  the plan and for deploying opposition forces in these countries  [plural noun as received] and along the borders with Sudan.    Commenting on Egypt's stance on these possibilities, the  sources said that Cairo will not object to any resolution that  might be passed by the international community against Sudan,  noting the Egyptian Government's recent stand that it will not  intervene in any decision.    The sources ruled out the possibility of Cairo objecting to  the deployment of international and "American" forces in  southern Sudan.    Last week, AL-SAFIR published a report that confirmed that  the Egyptian Foreign Ministry is opposed to Washington's efforts  to set up safe havens in the south, noting that it is this  Egyptian opposition that is blocking such a move.    The sources, however, regarded the Egyptian Foreign Ministry  "as being not concerned in Sudanese affairs." The sources  stressed that "Sudan has always been regarded in Cairo as the  responsibility of the Egyptian Intelligence Agency, not the  Foreign Ministry."    As far as self-determination in the south is concerned, the  sources said that the rebels' call for a referendum on  separation is an ill-intentioned call because it is not in the  interests of either the northern or southern parties.    The sources said that Garang's wing does not support  breaking away completely from the north (because of its close  ties with the north and its leftist tendencies and because its  ties with Washington are not solid). Meanwhile, the dissident  wing, led by Riak Mashar, supports that demand "only for the  sake of one-upsmanship."    The sources added that the tribal system in the south does  not allow it to break away "because this would trigger bloody  battles among the tribes, which would fight for control." Added  to this is the absence of an administrative structure or a  system that could help the south build a "state" or separate  entity.    The sources noted that breaking away would force the  southern  authorities to seek the help of "foreign experts" to build their  state. These "experts" would probably be from the north,  particularly since the states surrounding the south lack  suitable cadres, and in addition are mostly French-speaking.  Arabic is the only common language of the southerners, who  speak different dialects.    Moreover, the sources touched on the issue of oil in the  south. The discovery of large amounts of oil in the south has  strengthened some sectors' demand to break away. The  southerners will need workers and experts to work in that field.  Although it is possible to seek the help of foreign experts,  the workers will all be from the south. This means an internal  migration that could fan tribal disputes. Some tribes will not  let rivals stay and work in their zone.    The sources referred also to the issue of the south's  "borders" if it breaks away--an issue that is yet to be settled.  Some demand that these borders be extended to the south of  Khartoum and accordingly encompass ravaged areas, something the  northerners will not allow.    The sources wondered about the fate of the one million  refugees who have been living in the north for years. These  have changed their traditions and lifestyle. "Will they return  to the south if it breaks away and will they find a place in  areas totally different now from those they grew up in?" the  sources asked.    The sources noted two additional reasons--both foreign--that  preclude breaking away. The first has to do with "the OAU  charter," which views the post-colonial borders in Africa as  final and unchangeable under any circumstances. The second has  to do with Sudan's neighboring states, most of whom house many  tribes. A breakaway would set a precedent encouraging these  tribes to fight among themselves and demand the right to  self-determination.</p>

			<p><P> March 29, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH;  </P> <P> NANCY REAGAN TELLS OF CANCER EPISODE  </P> <P> There were, to be sure, glimpses of the strong, independent-minded woman who  liked to take jabs at the Washington establishment during her tumultuous eight  years in the White House.  </P> <P> But by and large, it was a different and seemingly more vulnerable side of  Nancy Reagan that was on display before some 560 supportive women in Newport  Beach on Wednesday as the former First Lady shared her experience with cancer.  </P> <P> "I felt my stomach start to tighten," Mrs. Reagan said, relating the day in  1985 when the doctor closed the examination room door to tell her the results  of a routine mammogram.  </P> <P> "I knew -- I could feel the bad news coming, and there was no way to stop it,"  she said. "I thought -- 'Ronnie, what would he do?' "  </P> <P> After her speech at the Four Seasons Hotel, Mrs. Reagan went to Hoag Hospital  in Newport Beach to meet with more than two dozen cancer patients. She received  some flowers, looked at a few scrapbooks and, for the most part, listened to  the stories of the patients.  </P> <P> But at a morning brunch organized by the Circle 1000 Club, an association of  Orange County women that is raising funds for the soon-to-open, $22-million  Hoag Cancer Center, it was Mrs. Reagan doing most of the talking. Met with a  standing ovation, Mrs. Reagan said that after learning of her breast cancer,  she rejected the option of a lumpectomy -- to remove only the cancerous tissue  itself -- and instead decided on a radical mastectomy to remove the left  breast.  </P> <P> It was a decision that prompted some public criticism from medical  professionals and others in Washington at the time, and Mrs. Reagan said that  stung.  </P> <P> "What right did they have to tell me I'd made the wrong decision?" she asked.  </P> <P> She defended her decision, saying: "I wasn't 20 years old, I'd been married for  38 years and I'd had my children, and (the radical mastectomy) seemed the  best," she said. "Besides, I'm not Dolly Parton."  </P> <P> Perhaps the most emotional part of the event came when Mrs. Reagan, appearing  near tears, talked about the death of her mother just days after her own  operation.  </P> <P> "Even though she didn't know me at the end, I still needed her a lot," Mrs.  Reagan said. "I really had no time to recover from the operation or to grieve  for my mother, whom I loved dearly."  </P> <P> Mrs. Reagan, who appeared without a fee, did not take questions from the media,  but she did field friendly inquiries from those at the brunch.  </P> <P> Circle 1000 chairman Sandy Sewell of Newport Beach said later: "At many times,  she seems on the defensive in public and in the media, but I think today she  let her guard down and showed her human side. . . . She seemed very warm and  caring.ERIC LICHTBLAU  </P></p>

			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / Observer: Victor ludorum It's been a busy month for Lord Mishcon, the 79-year-old Labour peer. What with acting on behalf of Lord Palumbo in a trust fund spat with two children from his first marriage; helping Lady Diana in her mission impossible; and finally assisting Lord Archer in his difficulties with Anglia TV shares, Mishcon can't have had much of a summer break. Oddly enough, Anglia TV used to be a client of Lord Mishcon's firm. When Victor Mishcon merged with partners from Bartletts, de Reya in February 1988  -forming Mishcon de Reya - one of the clients brought along by Bartletts was Anglia TV which, since 1987 as the whole world by now knows, has numbered among its non-executive directors Mary Doreen Archer; though Anglia TV now gets its advice elsewhere. The Palumbo-Mishcon-Archer network goes back to 1974, when Jeffrey Archer was seriously strapped for cash. Archer's friend, Peter Palumbo, offered Archer the services of his solicitor, Mishcon, who dissuaded Archer from declaring himself bankrupt. 'Without that gift I'd have gone under,' Archer said recently. The rest, as they say, is history.</p>

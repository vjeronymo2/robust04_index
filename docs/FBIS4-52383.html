			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Yi Sung-chol] </F>   [Text] It is reported that the Dialogue for Economic  Cooperation [DEC] between the ROK and the United States, which  was established as a result of the ROK-U.S. summit talks of last  year, will discontinue one year after its formation.    DEC, the highest-level trade consultative body to fine-tune  two countries'views, is now destined to discontinue under the  circumstances in which innumerable trade issues pending between  the two countries--such as the lowering of tariffs on foreign  cars and the protection of intellectual property rights--are  brought up. As a result, trade friction between the ROK and the  United States will further deepen.    On 8 May, a person in authority at the government said: "DEC  was established last year with a view to systematically dealing  with pending economic and trade issues between the ROK and the  United States, treating it as a matter of policy. But, because  the United States has been making an item-by-item approach to  pending trade issues, DEC is in fact becoming good for nothing.  In this respect, the government is seriously considering  whether to discontinue DEC."    He continued: "The United States, too, is now making clear  that DEC is unnecessary unless major pending trade issues,  including intellectual property rights and the lowering of  tariffs on sausages and foreign cars, are resolved. Therefore,  it is predicted that DEC will virtually discontinue at the end  of this June."    Presently, in addition to DEC, there are other consultative  bodies between the ROK and the United States such as the  ROK-U.S. Economic Consultative Meeting and the ROK-U.S. Trade  Working-Level Committee.</p>

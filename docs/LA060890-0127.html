			<p><P> June 8, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BELLA LEWITZKY MAY REJECT NEA GRANT OF $72,000  </P> <P> The famed Bella Lewitzky Dance Company in Los Angeles is considering rejection  of a $72,000 grant from the National Endowment for the Arts in what would be  the most serious episode yet in a continuing artist protest over anti-obscenity  provisions in the endowment's 1990 grant guidelines.  </P> <P> The possibility that Lewitzky, the internationally acclaimed 74-year-old  choreographer who has received NEA funding regularly since 1972, might turn  down a major grant this year was confirmed to The Times on Thursday by sources  close to her company.  </P> <P> These sources noted that turning down NEA operating support would strike a  serious blow against the Lewitzky company's financial stability. The company  has an estimated 1990 budget of about $850,000.  </P> <P> It was uncertain when Lewitzky would disclose her final decision, but sources  familiar with the situation said she had been meeting with close advisers for  several days and had undertaken an extensive period of personal reflection on  the issue. These sources indicated an announcement could come within the next  week to 10 days.  </P> <P> These sources indicated that Lewitzky, who has long been identified with  political activist causes, was deeply troubled by what she reportedly perceives  as insurmountable obstacles to artistic freedom implicit in the NEA funding  requirements -- despite the fact that her company has never been identified  with presentation of sexually explicit work.  </P> <P> But sources familiar with deliberations by Lewitzky and her associates in the  Bella Lewitzky Dance Company and the Dance Gallery, described the choreographer  as deeply troubled by provisions in the NEA funding law that ban support of  work that is judged obscene by the NEA and does not meet high standards of  artistic merit.  </P> <P> Lewitzky is one of the most established artists supported by the NEA. Since  1972, she and her companies have received nearly $1,446,000 in NEA funds,  according to the arts endowment. The company received $72,000 last year and  $68,000 in 1988.  </P> <P> The Dance Gallery, a proposed $20 million downtown performance space that has  proved difficult to bring to fruition, has received $650,000 in NEA money in a  program that requires private funds to be raised at a 3-to-1 ratio. Lewitzky is  the founder and artistic director of the Dance Gallery, but its grants would be  unaffected by any decision by Lewitzky to turn down NEA operating support in  1990.  </P> <P> The anti-obscenity requirement was imposed by Congress last year in the midst  of a continuing political battle over the arts endowment's support of  controversial artworks and performances. In recent weeks, several NEA grantees  have announced they would reject money this year.  </P> <P> The largest rejection thus far has been by New York City theater producer  Joseph Papp, who turned down $50,000 in NEA funding several weeks ago. Papp  said that although his productions are unlikely to be judged obscene, an NEA  requirement that grantees certify in writing that they will not produce obscene  work is antithetical to maintaining artistic freedom. The producer argued that  the judgment of what is obscene could be influenced by political  considerations.  </P> <P> Papp also said he would reject another $400,000 in anticipated NEA support  later this year if the arts endowment does not rescind its anti-obscenity  requirement. After Papp rejected the first $50,000, Los Angeles television  producer Mark Goodson made a donation in that amount to Papp's New York City  Shakespeare festival.  </P> <P> But sources familiar with the situation noted that a decision by Lewitzky to  turn down her entire NEA grant this year would have a far greater proportional  effect on her company than Papp's decision. These sources noted that Lewitzky's  grant, under the endowment's program of operating support for nationally  significant dance companies, is devoted to development of new work, rehearsal  and dancer salaries.  </P> <P> * SPECIAL RESTRICTION -- The NEA requires a New York art center to report in  advance on individual performances.

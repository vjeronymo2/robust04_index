			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOSCOW POLL FINDS SUPPORT FOR REFORMS  </P> <P> About 71% of Muscovites believe reforms should be accelerated, but only 17.6%  would call Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's perestroika a good policy,  according to a new survey.  </P> <P> The poll was sponsored by the French economic magazine l'Expansion and  state-run France Inter radio. It was conducted by the Center for Political  Studies of the Soviet Union, which questioned 922 people in Moscow between Nov.  1 and Nov. 15.  </P> <P> Only 3.8% of the Muscovites questioned thought the economic situation had  improved in recent years. But 57.6% thought Gorbachev's policies will be  successful in the next five years, against 32.5% who were doubtful they will  work.  </P> <P> Communism still was favored by about 36% of Muscovites polled, but 29% admitted  being against it, with 33% cautiously refusing to reply. As many as 34% said  they favored capitalism, 37% said they opposed it and 28.2% said they were  undecided.  </P></p>

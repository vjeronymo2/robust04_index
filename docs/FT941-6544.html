			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Stable Treasury bonds give support to stocks Wall Street Higher Treasury bond prices helped US stocks post gains, although blue chip issues failed to participate in the wider market rally, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had been up 13 points at one stage, closed a net 6.76 down at 3,832.02. The rest of the market fared better, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gaining 1.07 at 467.14, the American SE composite 3.89 at 471.34 and the Nasdaq composite 8.72 at 792.50. New York SE volume was 267.4m shares. Trading opened against the backdrop of disturbing news from Bosnia, where US fighters were reported to have shot down four Bosnian aircraft which had been violating the United Nation's no-fly zone. Although conflict between Bosnian and US and UN forces in the former Yugoslavia would have little direct impact on financial markets in Europe or the US, the prospect of the US and its allies becoming involved in a prolonged military action in the region would not be good for stock market sentiment, which has already been rattled by rising interest rates in US and international bond markets and by upheavals in global currency markets. Once trading opened, however, it was clear that the market was willing to ignore the situation in Bosnia, at least for now. Investors were reassured by the fact that the downing of the Bosnia jets did not immediately escalate into further conflict. The market received a further boost when US bond prices rose steadily throughout the day, buoyed by a February Chicago purchasing managers' report which showed delining prices in the region and a downturn in the local employment market. By late afternoon the benchmark 30-year bond was up more than half a point, and the yield was down to 6.661 per cent. Tobacco issues were notably weaker in heavy trading. RJR Nabisco fell Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 6 7/8 and Philip Morris Dollars 2 to Dollars 56 as investors reacted to reports that the Food and Drug Administration was considering classifying nicotine as a drug because of mounting evidence that tobacco companies have been increasing the nicotine in their products to win or keep more customers. Philip Morris yesterday denied it was increasing the nicotine in its brands. Kmart held at Dollars 19 in spite of the big retailer announcing a loss of Dollars 974m, including large restructuring charges, for the fiscal year to end-January. The stock was steady because the bad news had been discounted. On the American SE, the 'B' shares in Viacom forged ahead Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 28 7/8 after the entertainment group reported annual net income of Dollars 155m and a big increase in subscribers to its MTV Europe channel. Canada Toronto advanced in moderate trading. The TSE 300 index ended 59.6 up at 4,423.8 and rises outpaced declines by 526 to 276 after volume of 53.3m shares valued at CDollars 664.4m. All 14 stock groups were higher. Golds, real estate and communications surged 2.36, 2.35 and 2.12 per cent respectively.</p>

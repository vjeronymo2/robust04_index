			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Iryna Andriychuk and Oleksandr Havrosh: "New </F> Year 'Oil Presents' From Santa Claus"]    [Excerpts] Who said that Ukraine lacks oil? At least, on  New Year's Eve, our state literally poured diesel fuel to  Slovakia. However, it was not our fault. An accident on the oil  pipeline close to Polyana in Svalylavskiy Rayon became a real  ecological disaster and caused a fuss around the world. [passage  omitted]    Some time ago, this pipeline secretly met the requirements  of  the defense industry of the Council for Mutual Economic  Cooperation. Its headquarters is still located in Samara [in  Russia], while its Transcarpathia Department is situated in  Rovno [in Ukraine]. This department has two oil reservoirs --  in Dubrinichi village (Perechinskiy Rayon) and Rososhi village  (Svalyavskiy Rayon).    At 1500 on 30 December 1993, Samara began pumping oil under  very high pressure. It is clear that a handmade pipe collar  broke and diesel fuel made its way to Europe by way of the river.    Unfortunately, the accident took place on 31 December, on  New  Year's Eve, when all the personnel were deep in thought sitting  around the table. The State Department for Environmental  Protection did everything possible to mobilize as many people as  possible into action. [passage omitted]    An enormous oil spill spread for kilometers and eventually  crossed the state border. People who saw the Latoritsa River at  that time, witnessed a terrible sight. The entire river was  covered with foam and a layer of oil.    Though the State Department for Environmental Protection  phoned everyone, everywhere, the officials in Chop were not  quick enough in closing the water-intake valves from the river.  This was how diesel fuel got into the city water system, making  the water unfit to drink.    Even on 9 January, the Latoritsa River near Chop was still  covered with oil. The environment has been irreversibly  damaged. The safety measures cost a lot of money. However, this  is just the beginning, because we cannot avoid international  responsibility for the contamination of the river. The Slovaks  promised to hold back, but this oil slick continued on to  Hungary, so when Budapest makes out a bill to Bratislava for  damages, we will have to pay it. [passage omitted]    The Prosecutors' Office should put an end to such  irresponsibility. Oil and gas pipelines should be properly  guarded. This is an axiom. Otherwise, we will have not a  flourishing Transcarpathia but a new Chernobyl monster.</p>

			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BLACK FRATERNITY OUT OF UNIFORM  </P> <P> Re "Elite Fraternity Widens Agenda for Black Men" (July 18): Black men are  surrounded by drugs, gangs, inadequate education and hopelessness. A  once-secret fraternity of prominent men decides that now is the time to come  out of the closet and try to find a role in the solution to these problems.  </P> <P> While I believe that the war against drugs, gangs, unemployment and inadequate  education is winnable, the tuxedo will not be the uniform of the victorious.  This war will be won by those who are not afraid to get their blue jeans dirty.  </P> <P> The teachers, preachers, counselors and community volunteers we need will not  be found at the captain's cocktail party while the battle is waged.  </P> <P> WILLIAM BURROUGHS  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 20 Mar (INA)--The newspaper AL-THAWRAH has  stressed that the split that took place within the UN Security  Council, along with the council's decision to stop issuing its  traditional statement, shows the extent of the positive change  in the international position as a result of Iraq's firmness and  adherence to its legitimate rights.    In an article today, the paper says that the overwhelming  majority of the world has come to realize that the United States  and Britain are involved in a dirty (?political) game that has  nothing to do with UN resolutions or law. Rather, they have  come to realize that this game is part of selfish interests and  calculations aimed at harming Iraq and other world peoples.    AL-THAWRAH indicates that the (?Iraqi letter) to the UN  Security Council clearly supported the Iraqi rights that  Washington, London, and world Zionism want to deny and to [words  indistinct] as a result of the imperialist aggression and the  unjust blockade that has been imposed on it.    The paper says: The free will of Iraq and the international  community has successfully exposed attempts to falsify facts and  the meaningless [word indistinct] that the representatives of  imperialism have shown at the UN Security Council.    AL-THAWRAH adds that, for the first time in three years, the  UN Security Council finds itself besieged by unequivocal Iraqi  facts. Therefore, Washington and London went crazy, and ordered  their representatives to oppose the issuance of any resolution  in the interest of Iraq. However, they failed to convince the  representatives of France, China, and Russia of the tendentious  U.S. and British argument for extending the blockade against  Iraq.    The paper stresses that Iraq has a fair case and is an  influential player in the Arab region and the world. Therefore,  it is not easy to blackout the evident Iraq role [words  indistinct] that want to see the truth.    The paper says that the U.S. and British administrations  should consider well the changes that are taking place inside  the United States and Britain, changes which indicate that many  U.S. and British parties are demanding that Washington and  London adopt a different policy on Iraq.    Concluding its article, the paper says that those who have  legitimate rights and adhere to their rights and independent  national decisionmaking, just like Iraq, must achieve a  comprehensive victory over the powers of evil and exploitation.</p>

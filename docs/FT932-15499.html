			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / Arts: LOVE Intensity is one of the great qualities the performing arts can demonstrate  -but it is only great when allied with spontaneity. Think of bad silent-movie acting, where actors roll their eyes, clutch their hair, and pose furiously to make an 'intense' - but contrived - effect. Well, it is easy for us to think complacently that such acting belongs in the past. Not so, however. Contrived intensity in modern theatre is alive and kicking, and whole styles have been based upon it. LOVE, a 90-minute piece made by Nigel Charnock for Volcano Theatre Company, is a good (bad) example. The three actors are endlessly intense; and yes, among other things, they clutch their hair, chew the furniture and pose furiously. This is a vile style - but it passes as something new because the three performers also grope and French-kiss one another, stuff hands down each other's underwear, sit in the laps of certain audience members, and recite numerous Shakespeare sonnets. Oh yes, and several Shirley Bassey songs are played too. Time and again, the three players urge themselves into various forms of hysterical behaviour. They hurl themselves at each other, throw each other about, drop each other; and this occurs in cyclical patterns that accelerate so as to suggest the crescendo of hysteria. The woman (Fern Smith) repeatedly lets her hair fall over her face, only to sweep it back. (Among the many current dance-theatre cliches used in LOVE, this must be the worst.) Frenetic sex scenes abound, though remarkably unappealing. LOVE means to reflect the set-up that produced Shakespeare's sonnets. It has its own dark lady, one cuter and younger man, and another man more gaunt and sensitive. This, however, should not detain us. LOVE tells you no more about the erotic nexus within Shakespeare's sonnets that any intelligent adolescent could glean from them. The performers yell the words and ignore the scansion. Nigel Charnock is well known as a performer with DV8 Physical Theatre, and LOVE exemplifies all the trashy excesses of DV8 style without any of DV8's occasional virtues (wit, craftsmanship, ambiguity). Every situation plunges rapidly off the deep end. Everybody squeezes each other's pecs, licks waists, feels groins, and there is kissing, jumping, catching and bashing galore. More than once, the woman kisses and beats her man. Alternate lines of 'Shall I compare thee to a summer's day' are yelled by man and woman as they wrestle each other violently around the floor. Never mind emotion recollected in tranquillity - as far as LOVE is concerned, poetry is emotion simulated in hysteria. At the Riverside Studios, London W6, until April 17</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Susanna Reinboth: "Appeals Court Reduced </F> Sentences of Amphetamine Gang Members"]    [Text] The Helsinki Court of Appeals has reduced the  sentences of several individuals convicted of involvement in an  amphetamines gang. The gang on three separate occasions during  the period May-August 1992 brought a total amount of 32 kg of  the drugs into Finland.    Sentences for the two brothers thought to be the ringleaders  were not changed. Vanta resident and salesman Raine Bruno  Tienhaara, 35, was sentenced to 10 years, and Helsinki auto  salesman Raimo Anthoni Tienhaara, 36, was sentenced to nine and  a half years in prison.    A courier on two of the smuggling trips, salesman Eki  Petteri  Sosunov, 24, had his sentence reduced to a seven-year prison  term. The Helsinki Municipal Court had originally given him a  sentence of two years longer. The Appeals Court based the  sentence reduction on the fact that Sosunov had cooperated with  authorities in solving the case.    Sentences of two others convicted in the case were reduced  to  about one year. Helsinki motorcycle mechanic Risto Yrjo Tapio  Haverinen, 29, had his sentence reduced to six years, and  Helsinki offset printer Harri Marko Juhani Lihtavuo, 27, had his  reduced to six and a half years.  <H5>  Sentences "Too Severe" </H5>   The Court of Appeals did not explain the reduced sentences  for Haverinen and Lihtavuo, except by stating that their  sentences "are considered too severe." Sentences of the others  remained unchanged.    The Court of Appeals excused the convicted from paying  compensation to the state based on the drug value, since the  narcotics code regarding this has been changed. According to a  new law that came into force at the start of this year, the drug  value no longer has to be paid to the state.    The municipal court had ordered the Tiehaara brothers to pay  some 1.3 million markkas, with smaller compensation amounts to  be paid by the others.    Some of those involved in this case were also convicted in a  related case involving bombings of a tax office. Sosunov, who  participated in this in separate incidents in October 1991 and  March 1992, received the most severe sentence. The government  prosecutor eventually gave up his attempt to convict Raimo  Tienhaara on incitement charges.</p>

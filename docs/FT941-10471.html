			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / UK Company News: MBO planned at Ferranti plant Managers from Ferranti International's Cairo Mill component manufacturing business are planning a buy-out of the Oldham-based plant which employs 490 staff and had turnover of Pounds 30m last year. Ferranti Components, which designs and manufactures specialist micro-electronic components for use in defence and civil applications, was specifically not included in the MBO plans covering the bulk of Ferranti's operations unveiled by another team of managers in December. The four-man Cairo Mill buy-out team, led by Mr Angus Mincher, general manager, and advised by Ernst &amp; Young, plans to present a bid to Ferranti's administrative receivers, Mr Murdoch McKillop and Mr John Talbot from Arthur Andersen, early next month. Potential financial backers for the bid have been approached. The receivers, who welcomed the latest buy-out proposal yesterday, were appointed in early December after GEC withdrew a 1p a share rescue bid for the ailing defence electronics group. Explaining the MBO proposal, Mr Mincher said: 'We have now formulated a strategy to develop the business from its existing base. Our order book represents more than a year's work. This gives us time to win back customer confidence which has inevitably been strained over the recent difficult weeks. 'We will be looking to develop our business both in existing core areas and by diversification in the medium term. We have a strong skills base in the Oldham plant which we will develop further.' Mr Mike Davis of Ernst &amp; Young, added: 'The components business has the necessary ingredients for a successful buy-out, a sound product base, blue chip customers and a strong management team.' Separately, it emerged yesterday that the administrative receivers have taken the highly unusual step of writing to the Cairo Mill employees advising them that they do not anticipate any further redundancies, and promising that if there are more redundancies employees will be given at least one month's notice. In the letter Mr James Gleave, the Manchester-based Arthur Andersen partner responsible for the plant, says: 'I hope (this step) gives you extra confidence both in the future of Cairo Mill and our ability to sell the business without any need for further job losses.'</p>

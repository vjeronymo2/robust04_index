			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Management: Testing time for new recruits - Alison Smith on the sensitive process of finding financial regulators Strong views about the national lottery or knowledge of champagne-making techniques are not the most obvious attributes of a financial regulator. Yet voicing firm opinions and displaying expertise helped two candidates to make progress through the selection procedure to join the Personal Investment Authority, the regulator which protects the private investor. The last session for testing a small group of applicants was held late last month, with final interviews yet to take place. The PIA became operational in July, and has spent the autumn seeking to recruit more than 30 monitoring and enforcement staff. Many of its employees come from its two predecessor regulators  - Lautro and Fimbra  - which covered life insurance companies and independent financial advisers respectively. But the 'step change' in investor protection which it is intended to bring about has led it to expand operations. While there are many people with relevant experience working in compliance departments of financial services companies, the PIA was seeking so many candidates that it wanted to widen the potential pool. This required a recruitment process in which lack of expert knowledge of the financial services act was not a barrier to performing well. The result was the assessment centre designed and run for the regulator by the management consultancy arm of Coopers &amp; Lybrand. The assesment took half a day and comprised four main elements, starting with a personality questionnaire. From four statements in each of 40 questions, candidates were asked which most or least applied to them. In one, for example, that choice would show whether they were the sort of person who: 'shows concern for others; prefers the tried and tested approach; controls my moods; weighs up the alternatives quickly'. The aim was to identify 'danger areas' such as little social confidence or lack of a methodical approach. The next test was to deliver a six-minute presentation on a subject not related to work and answer questions on it for four minutes. Candidates' choice of subjects ranged from mundane to wildly ambitious: from the London Borough of Croydon to arguments about surrogate motherhood. Weaknesses such as expecting to keep attention with a dull topic or addressing too wide a theme appeared to count for surprisingly little compared with efforts to plough bravely on. The third test was a group discussion, in which candidates were given a short brief and 30 minutes to prepare a five-minute presentation on the PIA's future. The three assessors from the PIA and C&amp;L seemed to find ignorance of financial regulation less material than participation in the group  - although they did comment on how some candidates had failed to use background information provided. The final element was a verbal and critical reasoning test, which involved candidates reading short passages, and saying whether statements related to each were true, false or could not be judged because there was not enough information. Ann Shepherd, management consultant at C&amp;L executive resourcing, says the key to making assessment centres work is getting the right mix of tests. 'The PIA is concentrating really on communication, general impact and influence, and overall analysis and problem-solving,' she says. 'Other organisations might put less emphasis on communication and more on analytical skills, and the combination of tests would change to reflect that.' While the exercise worked in terms of bringing in a range of candidates from outside financial services  - such as police officers, barristers and civil servants  - it is already clear that not all the places will be filled. More significantly, there is the question of whether the right candidates have been selected. The PIA's record as a regulator over the coming years will be one of the ways that judgments will be made.</p>

Belarus's  Joining the Ruble Zone in the Interests of the Two Countries"]    [Text] The mass media have recently carried a whole series  of reports on Belarus's joining the ruble zone. The agreement  is regarded as extremely unfavorable to Russia. This, however,  does not square with reality, to put it mildly. If only because  no agreement has yet been signed and, accordingly, the terms  have not been decided.    There is only the intention of two friendly countries to  create such a union, and its framework terms have been decided.  The agreement itself, recording the basic principles for  uniting the monetary systems, is still being prepared.    For it is only possible to unite monetary systems if the two  countries have tough, coordinated price, credit, tax, and budget  policies. This also presupposes the presence of a single  emission center in the united ruble zone, a switch to unified  discount rates for central bank credits, and the implementation  of a unified currency policy in respect of third countries.    Opponents of Belarus's joining the ruble zone believe that  this will have lots of highly negative consequences for the  Russian economy. But is this so?    We must obviously start looking for the answer by assessing  Russia's strategic interests -- both economic and geopolitical.  Nobody any longer disputes the existence of such interests. The  question is different: Does closer economic integration with  Belarus accord with these interests? It undoubtedly does.    In the long term, from the viewpoint of Russia's strategic  state interests, the policy of reintegration with all the CIS  countries, including Belarus, is the only correct one because of  a whole number of objective reasons.    The most important of these is the smoothing of the  consequences of the USSR's breakup in the economic sphere, which  significantly deepened the crisis in all the states, including  Russia. The former Union republics are the traditional market  where Russia's output is competitive. Imports of raw materials  and subassemblies from these countries also cannot be quickly  replaced by Russian production or imports. In this sense  Russia's losses from the breaking of ties clearly are not  comparable with the possible expense of arranging trade and  economic relations with partners in the CIS.    All this, apart from Russia's dependence on imported raw  materials, also applies fully to Belarus. A whole range of  production facilities are concentrated there which are either  absent in Russia (heavy quarry dump trucks, for example) or  which produce output that is superior to analogous Russian  output in terms of its technical and economic parameters  (Belarus tractors). In addition, many Russian enterprises are  linked with Belarusian ones by collaborative deliveries.  Transit oil and gas pipelines pass over this state's territory  to Europe, as do railroads and roads. Belarus has a relatively  developed foreign trade infrastructure (customs, warehouses,  transshipment bases), and Russia is extremely interested in  using it.    The provision of facilities on its own western borders is  too  much of a luxury, given Russia's present economic position. In  addition, there have been very great losses in paying for  Russian freight to transit Belarusian territory.    Of course, the Belarusian market is also very large and  attractive from the viewpoint of selling Russian output (and not  just raw materials). It is plainly not in Russia's interests to  surrender this market to other countries.    Now about the negative consequences which might affect the  Russian economy as a result of merging the two countries'  monetary systems. These are undoubtedly possible if the  mechanism of this merger is not worked out.    The paramount need is to standardize economic legislation.  We have already spoken of the need for a single emission  center. The exchange rate for Belarusian rubles and Russian  rubles is a very acute problem.    It is obvious that a rate of one to one, given exchange  quotations of at least three to one, will cause a sharp surge in  inflation -- which will lead ultimately to negative consequences  not only for Russia but also for Belarus itself. We should seek  a mutually acceptable solution to the exchange rate -- a  solution based on realistic assessments of the real value of  Belarusian money. In this sense the exchange rate can serve  only as a guideline. It does not reflect the actual correlation.    As regards supplying Belarus with cash in hand, this can be  done on a security. Only it should be remembered here that its  terms must be acceptable to Belarus.    If these requirements are fulfilled, the two countries'  closer economic integration can even now ensure for Russia a  definite economic gain. Since foreign economic ties are being  activated, the problems of transactions and payments, which are  currently exerting a highly adverse impact on our economy, will  be simplified.</p>

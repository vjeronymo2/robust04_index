The shares fell 96 cents to ADollars 12.98 (USDollars 9.20), their lowest since November 1990, after directors said earnings for the half to June faced a marked fall. They cited recession in Europe as the main reason, but added full-year earnings should not fall more than 15 per cent on the earlier ADollars 180.2m.</p>

			<p><P> February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GUGGENHEIM DEAL LEAVES PANZA'S CALIFORNIA ART IN PLAY  </P> <P> New York's Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation may have acquired the lion's share  of Italian Count Giuseppe Panza di Biumo's contemporary American art collection  last weekend, but very little of his coveted California art was included in the  arrangement, the count revealed in an interview this week.  </P> <P> "I retain ownership of the largest part of the California art, about 80 works  of Light and Space art plus some new work I acquired in the past two years,"  the indefatigable 67-year-old collector said from his New York hotel. "I have  always been interested in having the part of my collection that includes  California artists in California. I hope this will become true one day, but it  is a question of finding the right sponsor.  </P> <P> "If a sponsor will pay for a building, I will make a gift for such a project to  keep the works all together and have them in California."  </P> <P> Former hopefuls who thought the Guggenheim purchase had made them also-rans  brightened when apprised of this new twist. "I would never foreclose on such an  idea," said County Art Museum Director Earl A. (Rusty) Powell. "I'm glad the  door is still open."  </P> <P> Museum of Contemporary Art Director Richard Koshalek said that if the  California works remain available, he would like to "explore and discuss" their  acquisition. In 1983, Los Angeles' Museum of Contemporary Art purchased Panza's  80-work Abstract Expressionist and classic Pop compendium for $11 million to  form the core of its permanent collection.  </P> <P> For the last decade, Powell, Koshalek and virtually every other museum director  in California hoped to obtain Panza's collection of several hundred works of  Minimalist and Conceptual art of the '60s and '70s. Widely praised as the  finest private holding of its type, it was particularly attractive here because  of heavy representation of so-called California Light and Space art. The style  is regarded as among the most original in contemporary art and involved the  talents of such innovators as Robert Irwin, James Turrell, Doug Wheeler, Eric  Orr and Maria Nordman.  </P> <P> "I have always personally regretted that this amazing holding has not found a  home here," said Henry Hopkins, director of the Frederick R. Weisman Collection  and former director of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.  </P> <P> Hopkins thought he detected a shift in Panza's conditions. "He seems to have  moved from a previous position where he wanted first a long-term loan followed  by a purchase, to a new posture, where he is willing to make a gift in exchange  for a building. I would still hope we could affect this as a possibility. The  art program of the Santa Monica Art Commission or the expanded Newport Harbor  Art Museum seem like possibilities."  </P> <P> Henry Korn, who heads the Santa Monica Art Commission, confirmed that "during  the past year or so," he and Panza discussed the possibility of installing the  California works in a hangar-like building that would be constructed at the  Santa Monica airport but termed the negotiations "speculative and  inconclusive."  </P> <P> Panza has held an extraordinarily large number of such discussions with museum  professionals throughout Europe and America, displaying great zeal and idealism  in regard to his collections. However, only one deal was actually cut prior to  the Guggenheim arrangement, the sale to MOCA. According to one expert, those  works are worth as much as $100 million today and are unavailable at any price.  </P> <P> A consistent Panza profile emerges from accounts given by art administrators  who have dealt with him. Ever polite, attentive and interested, he pursues  negotiations to the point of practical action and then "it all just sort of  evaporates," said one frustrated suitor who asked not to be named. "It's like  punching taffy."  </P> <P> Panza became a player on the Los Angeles scene when artist Robert Irwin  introduced him to MOCA in 1981. Panza approached the county museum's receptive  Powell in 1985. Talks snagged on Panza's insistence that his room-filling  installation works be kept together and on view.  </P> <P> Powell, realizing this was a physical impossibility for his museum, then put  together an informal consortium of MOCA Director Richard Koshalek, Hugh Davies  of the La Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art and Hopkins, who then directed the  San Francisco museum. The idea was to forge an arrangement whereby Panza's  works would rotate among the four museums with some prominently on view in each  place. The proposal was never accepted or rejected by Panza.  </P> <P> The Guggenheim agreement includes more than 300 works. About half the art, by  such key figures as Brice Marden, Robert Ryman, Donald Judd and Richard Serra,  will be purchased by the institution over six years for an unrevealed price  believed to be in the tens of millions of dollars.  </P> <P> Works that are physically movable will come to rest in the Guggenheim's  spiraling Frank Lloyd Wright building on Fifth Avenue, but insiders are  wondering how the museum will pay for the purchase and where it will house the  work. Guggenheim Foundation director Thomas Krens did not return calls from The  Times.  </P> <P> The balance of the acquisition will be a gift to the museum from Panza and will  include the buildings and land of his estate in Varese, outside Milan. It  houses many space-gobbling installations by the Californians and such other  luminaries as Dan Flavin, Sol LeWitt and Walter de Maria. The estate will  become a public museum operated through an endowment from the local Italian  government and administered by the Guggenheim.  </P> <P> The foundation, which is known to have a longstanding interest in increasing  its presence in Europe, has a museum in Venice, the Peggy Guggenheim  Collection.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Belgian Army has so far not been able to  intervene to evacuate its 2,000 nationals. The Rwandan  presidential guard did not want planes to land in Kigali  airport. An agreement with the authorities was finally reached.  A first aircraft belonging to the Belgian Army landed in Kigali  this afternoon. However, resentment against the Belgians is  still very strong within the Rwandan Army. We know that 14  Belgians, including 10 UN soldiers, were killed. Belgian Foreign  Minister Willy Claes condemns this attitude:    [Begin Claes recording] Of course, I regret it bitterly  because the one country that has been making significant efforts  for the benefit of Rwanda for years is Belgium. One cannot  forget that we used to be at the top of the charts of countries  cooperating with Rwanda. This is really a punishment we do not  deserve at all. This applies to the Hutu extremists.  Apparently, we have never been forgiven for withdrawing our  troops after four weeks (?when there were) irregularities, and  -- this is probably more significant -- we have never been  forgiven for playing a relatively important role in the peace  process where we always took a very objective, a very neutral  attitude. We told those political parties that were part of the  government and the so-called Patriotic Front rebels that there  was only one solution -- namely respect of the agreements, of  human rights, and giving priority to the socio-economic  situation of the population. Apparently, this was not to  everybody's taste. [end recording]</p>

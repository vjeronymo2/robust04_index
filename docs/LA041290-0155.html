			<p><P> April 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PHILHARMONIC SUSPENDS BASSIST LIEBERMAN  </P> <P> Los Angeles Philharmonic bassist Barry Lieberman was suspended for six months  without pay Tuesday night for allegedly assaulting a fellow bass player at a  children's concert at the Wiltern Theatre two weeks ago.  </P> <P> The suspension was the latest in a series of difficulties between Lieberman and  others in the Philharmonic organization, including claims made at a news  conference two months ago of harassment by a substitute violinist.  </P> <P> Philharmonic personnel manager Irving Bush declined to discuss the specifics of  the Lieberman matter but did confirm that the bassist had been suspended for  "assaulting one of the other bass players in the orchestra with his bass" and  uttering obscenities while children were present.  </P> <P> Lieberman -- who says Bush's violinist daughter Nicole has harassed him and his  wife ever since they were married three years ago -- acknowledged in an  interview Wednesday that he "blew up" and cursed at stand partner Jack Cousin  at the children's concert but denied that he attacked him. Lieberman said he  has not decided whether to contest the suspension.  </P> <P> Lieberman says he accidentally bumped Cousin with his instrument as they were  leaving the stage after the concert. Lieberman then claims that Cousin made an  insulting remark to his wife, fellow orchestra member Maria Larionoff.  </P> <P> "That's when I blew up," Lieberman said. "I started yelling and screaming,  "I've had enough of this . . . I can't stand it any more."  </P> <P> Cousin did not return phone calls from The Times.  </P> <P> An orchestra official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said: "Lieberman . .  . shoved his bass into the back of his stand partner's legs when they were  leaving the stage and uttered all sorts of profanities. He said, 'Move, you  so-and-so and get that so-and-so bass out of my way,' and then he shoved his  bass into his legs."  </P> <P> Lieberman and Larionoff claimed at their February news conference that Nicole  Bush made thousands of crank phone calls to their house and threw rocks and  eggs at the home of Larionoff's mother. At that time, they filed a lawsuit  against the Musicians Union, which had censured them for making accusations  against Bush to orchestra officials.  </P> <P> Nicole Bush has denied the couple's claims.  </P></p>

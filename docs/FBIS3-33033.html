Defense Minister  Oscar Camilion proposed a consensus agreement. Military Affairs  Secretary Jorge Baeza and Planning Secretary Guillermo  Etchechouri are responsible for its implementation. Thus the  confrontation between the U.S. Navy on one side, and Smiths  Industries and Lockheed is resolved.    The two secretaries yesterday met with Brigadiers Ricardo  Zini and Ricardo Coletti to discuss the participation of  Lockheed in the deal without delaying the planes delivery  schedule. This was the condition imposed by the Air Force,  which considered recommending not purchasing the Skyhawks if the  delivery of the planes was delayed for more than 24 months.  [passage omitted]    Faced with those arguments Camilion managed to find the  solution: He will not completely remove from the U.S. Navy the  business of repairing the planes, he will give some  participation to Lockheed. Smiths Industries and with the other  companies in charge of the electronic equipment of the Skyhawks  will also participate. This solution has the endorsement of  U.S. Ambassador James Cheek.    Following the decision by the U.S. Navy and Smiths  Industries  to share part of their business, Lockheed finds itself  participating in an operation worth about 250 million pesos.  Camilion's idea is to support the participation of the Military  Aircraft Factory in Cordoba, as planned by Lockheed. The  brigadiers do not agree. They want the planes quickly.</p>

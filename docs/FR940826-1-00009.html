			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A brief filed on behalf of Friendship, Kraft, Galloway Company, and the Sorrento Cheese Company, Buffalo, New York, expressed opposition to the 30-cent differential of Proposal One. This brief maintained that the appropriate differential should be ten cents and that placing the differential at thirty cents would be undue price enhancement of the Class II price and would only institutionalize an unintended aberration from the target differential. They contend that testimony of the proponents of Proposal One is flawed because it is based on the Class II prices that prevailed in 1990 when the M&hyph;W price recorded some of its lowest prices in a decade and because of the effects of the add-back provision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This brief cites past decisions that affirm that the current target 10-cent differential is appropriate, although because of the add-back provision, the target differential could not be met and this resulted in high Class II prices. It further revisits past decisions wherein concern was expressed that producer milk may not be made available for Class II use if the price falls below the Class III price. While experience has not borne this out, they say, caution still needs to be exercised in the relationship of Class II prices to Class III-A prices and substitution of powder for producer milk in the manufacture of Class II products. Increasing the differential would only provide additional stimulus to reduce handler purchases of producer milk. This brief also counters arguments on the role of over-order premiums, maintaining that such payments reflect the cost of services incurred by producers (such as balancing and transportation) and not the value of milk. They contend that such premiums should not be relevant to the raw product value of milk.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Lastly, the brief asserts that Proposal One's differential of thirty cents is an undue enhancement of the Class II price and has no basis from an economic point-of-view. The view presented is that thirty cents represents a differential of convenience between divergent views and is not arrived at on the basis of supply and demand considerations which, they say, any price change must be predicated upon.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In support of Proposal Three, a witness representing NFO testified that in addition to supporting a 50-cent Class II differential, they were also supporting the CMPC proposal that the add-back provision of current Class II pricing be retained. This witness testified that the record of the previous 43-day National Hearing in 1990 clearly supported a Class II differential of at least fifty cents. The witness indicated that if the classified pricing structure of Federal orders is to be of value, then there has to be meaningful price differences between classes. A class price break of only ten cents between Class III and Class II was not meaningful in the view of this witness. Additionally, said the NFO witness, handlers are already paying much more than the effective 30-cent Class II differential to secure Class II milk supplies, perhaps as much as $0.70 to $0.80 cents above Class III is regularly being paid. According to this witness, this indicates that the value of Class II milk is worth at least 50 cents over the Class III price. The NFO brief further emphasized that 50 cents establishes a differential level which is at least minimally significant in a classified price sense. Since Federal milk orders have three classes, then there should be a difference in the use value among the three categories of products sufficient enough to justify separate classes, said NFO.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another reason offered by the NFO witness for a 50-cent Class II differential is the devaluation of butterfat relative to the nonfat component of milk. Because Class II products have a significant butterfat content when viewed across all Class II products, Class II milk producers have suffered losses in milk used in this class, and this represents a reduction in costs to processors. This argument was reiterated in their brief.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Banker tells of fears over Soviet debt SOVIET debt could rise from Dollars 65bn to Dollars 75bn or more by the end of this year, a worrying rate of increase, says Mr Georg Krupp, Deutsche Bank's director responsible for eastern Europe. He said banks would now only lend to the Soviet Union against state guarantees, while exporters faced huge practical problems. As a result of decentralisation, they now had to deal with more than 40,000 Soviet companies, compared with 40 central foreign trade organisations previously. Mr Krupp said the Moscow government's compromise economic reform plan lacked a clear concept of privatisation and contained only half-hearted measures; it was neither market nor plan. Despite the difficulties, Mr Krupp said the Soviet Union needed western support. The funds to support the move from a planned to a free economy could only be raised by a joint effort of western countries, private banks, and institutions like the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. He hoped this weekend's Group of Seven meeting would revive the idea of an Dollars 18bn Marshall Plan for the Soviet Union. The G7 officials will discuss this, as well as closer links between Moscow and the IMF and World Bank. He added that west German banks had unsecured loans of DM10bn (Dollars 5.9bn) with the Soviet Union, with credits backed by the Hermes export guarantee organisation exceeding DM12bn. The financing of German exports was now only possible with the backing of Hermes, which would become more selective; Soviet-German trade was likely to drop even further, at least temporarily.</p>

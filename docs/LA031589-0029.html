			<p><P> March 15, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: KENTLING RESIGNING AS MISL'S COMMISSIONER  </P> <P> Bill Kentling, the third commissioner in the Major Indoor Soccer League's  11-year history, announced his resignation Tuesday, effective at the end of his  current contract May 31.  </P> <P> Despite widespread rumors that he was forced out by league owners, Kentling  maintained until as late as this week that the decision whether to resign was  solely his.  </P> <P> Kentling, who was appointed on June 1, 1986, said he resigned because owners  who weren't in the league when he took over should have the opportunity to  choose their own man.  </P> <P> Ron Fowler, the Sockers' owner, said a committee headed by Baltimore Blast  Owner Stuart Weitzman and including Socker President Ron Cady would likely name  a successor to Kentling in the next 30 days.  </P></p>

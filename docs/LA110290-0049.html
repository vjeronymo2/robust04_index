			<p><P> November 2, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> EL DORADO FINALLY GETS A LEAGUE VICTORY  </P> <P> El Dorado High School's football players finally got a league victory to go  with their bumps and bruises.  </P> <P> El Dorado's 28-10 victory over visiting Katella Thursday night at Valencia High  was the school's first in an Empire League game in two years.  </P> <P> "We've been doing the same things all year," El Dorado Coach Rick Jones said.  "But we've been doing it at a new intensity level lately."  </P> <P> To make the playoffs, El Dorado (2-7, 1-3 in league) must beat Los Alamitos  next week and Cypress and Katella (2-7, 2-2) must both lose.  </P> <P> El Dorado sophomore Bryan Warner rushed for 171 yards and two touchdowns in 28  carries, and also scored on a 65-yard pass play from Jason Bluth.  </P> <P> Bluth threw for 202 yards and two touchdowns, completing nine of 13 passes. A  senior, Bluth was the quarterback on last year's 0-10 Hawk team.  </P> <P> "It was a long time coming," Bluth said. "We worked hard and it finally paid  off."  </P> <P> Bluth's confidence has been building each game.  </P> <P> "When you talk about evolution, Darwin has nothing on Jason," Jones said. "He  is developing into a great leader and an outstanding quarterback." STUART  MATTHEWS  </P></p>

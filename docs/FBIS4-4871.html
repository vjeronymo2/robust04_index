			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial from 5 April PASASON: "Wholeheartedly Salute and </F> Welcome the Commonwealth of Australia Government Delegation"]    [Text] In response to an invitation from His Excellency  [H.E.] Khamtai Siphandon, prime minister of the Lao People's  Democratic Republic [LPDR], H.E. Paul Keating, prime minister of  the Commonwealth of Australia, will lead a Commonwealth of  Australia Government delegation on an official, friendly visit  to the LPDR on 5 April. The multiethnic Lao people throughout  the country -- elated at this event, which is significant in  Lao-Australian relations -- feel greatly honored to have the  opportunity to welcome the Commonwealth of Australia Government  delegation.    This official, friendly visit to the LPDR by the prime  minister of the Commonwealth of Australia and his delegation  follows the official, friendly visit to the Commonwealth of  Australia by H.E. Khamtai Siphandon in mid-December 1993. The  visit is considered a new and significant event since the  establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries  over four decades ago. This visit to the LPDR by the prime  minister of the Commonwealth of Australia and his delegation  reflects the Australian people's good friendship with the  multiethnic Lao people. It is also considered a very  significant event in the history of relations between the two  countries. It will, therefore, serve as a firm basis for  strengthening friendly relations and cooperation effectively in  the immediate and long terms in the interest of the peoples of  Laos and Australia, thus contributing to the common trend for  the establishment and promotion of peace, stability, friendship,  and cooperation among various countries in this region and the  rest of the world.    Laos and Australia have maintained good relations for a long  time. Over the past 10 years or so, the two sides have made  efforts to promote relations in various fields. It is  noteworthy that following the visit to Australia by H.E. Prime  Minister Khamtai Siphandon, Lao-Australian relations have  developed ever more extensively and rapidly. On this occasion,  the multiethnic Lao people would like to express their profound  gratitude to the Australian Government and people for the  significant support and assistance they have rendered to the Lao  Government and people in building and developing the LPDR's  economy and society, especially in building the communications  infrastructure, training technicians in various branches, and  developing communities. The assistance in the construction of  the Friendship Bridge, which serves as a good token of the  friendly relations and fruitful cooperation between Laos and  Australia, is noteworthy.    We wish H.E. Paul Keating, prime minister of the  Commonwealth  of Australia, and his party glorious success in this official,  friendly visit to the LPDR. Its success which will contribute  to further promoting and expanding relations and cooperation  between the two countries ever more fruitfully for the benefit  of the peoples of Laos and Australia.</p>

			<p><P> February 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GANGS AND SCHOOL LIFE  </P> <P> Your concern for the educational and social environment of Edwin Markham  Intermediate School is exemplary. Your previous article on the "Super Kids of  Watts," (the Markham Pentathletes) was well-received by the student body,  faculty, staff and region administrators. However, your article on Feb. 5  ("Gang Tension: At School, Survival Comes First," Part I) did just the  opposite.  </P> <P> Your staff could have taken a more positive approach in recognizing the  majority of the student body at Markham instead of the minority you seemed to  relish, dwelling on gang tension.  </P> <P> Instead of reinforcing feared beliefs of inner-city students, you could have  mentioned the two track stars in the '88 Olympics, Kevin Young and Florence  Griffith Joyner, who were former Markham students. You could have mentioned  alumni from Markham that are doctors, lawyers, entrepreneurs, teachers, and  administrators. You could have mentioned the 88 students in 1987 and the 60  students in 1988 who participated in the Run for Fun city competition. We also  have students who participate in the Jesse Owens track meets. We send students  yearly to regional algebra and geometry competition. Our students take the PSAT  and participate in the Saturday Med-Core Program. We have other students who  participate in drama, dance, and Shakespearean festivals.  </P> <P> As a teacher, alumnus, and parent, I, too, am concerned about Markham and the  long-neglected students who are neither "gangbangers" or pentathletes. They are  the students who walk to and from school with no problems because they don't  hang out with gang members. They are the students who regularly attend class,  and learn in the process. They are the 57% who graduate from Markham, graduate  from high school and for some, attend at least one year of college. They are  the students whom corporate America should invest in because they possess a  strong sense of character to survive no matter what the situation.  </P> <P> EARLENE CONROE  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

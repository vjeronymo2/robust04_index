			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Rifkind dismisses rearguard action to save Rosyth yard A REARGUARD campaign in favour of Scotland's Rosyth naval dockyard foundered yesterday when the government confirmed that it was to concentrate refitting of nuclear submarines at the rival Devonport yard in Plymouth. The announcement by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, came after three months of talks with unions, dockyard companies, MPs and private-sector repairers. 'No new considerations have been put forward which would cause the government to change its original proposal,' Mr Rifkind said. The submarine work is worth up to Pounds 5bn over the next 20 years. The decision to do it in upgraded facilities at Devonport was announced in June after a two-year battle between the dockyards. Rosyth can expect one contract to refit a Swiftsure class submarine before losing this part of its business in 1996. In compensation, it has been promised a work programme including refits of 18 warships up to 2005. Babcock Thorn, which runs the government-owned yard, said it was seeking firm guarantees for these contracts or alternative work. The announcement came as no surprise as the yard had assumed the decision was unlikely to change. It was confident the yard was still 'a solid and viable business'. The decision paves the way for the next stage in dockyard privatisation. The Ministry of Defence is expected in the next three or four months to issue invitations to tender for the management and possible ownership of dockyard facilities. Management contracts with Babcock Thorn and Devonport Management were due to expire next year, but have been extended.</p>

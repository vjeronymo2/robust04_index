			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hindi </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Helpless Alternative"] </F>   [Text] Prime Minister Narasimha Rao has said that agreement  on the Dunkel proposals is the best alternative in the present  situation. The prime minister has thus admitted that we are  obliged to accept it. What else can we do? We cannot proceed  with the process of economic liberalization if we reject the  agreement. Our share in international trade is only one percent  and our situation could get worse if we stay out of this  multi-party international agreement. The permanent committee of  the commerce ministry had recommended to the government that the  country should participate in multi-party trade so that it is  not left alone. The world has divided into many small and large  trade groups. On one side are the major economic powers like the  United States and Japan and such powerful groups as the European  Economic Alliance. On the other side are the developing  countries like India burdened with foreign debts. A few advanced  nations are monopolizing international trade. It is their voice  that is heard on all the economic and trade platforms. Despite  their majority, the voice of the developing countries is lost  like that of a "flute in a drum band." Mr. Rao said that our  government has done what was the best thing to do. According to  him if India had not opposed some of the Dunkel proposals  resolutely, the Uruguay decisions would have hurt our nation.  There is not doubt that India and other developing countries  have managed to remove some problematic provisions in the Dunkel  proposals, however, we cannot claim that our efforts to protect  our interests in the area of agriculture and intellectual assets  have been successful. Commerce Minister Pranab Mukherji has also  admitted in the Parliament that he was not satisfied with the  decision of importing nations to keep the same system of garment  imports at the rate of import quotas for the next 10 years.    The nation, especially the opposition parties, are opposing  the Dunkel proposals. They fear that it will make us lose our  economic autonomy and our nation will be forced to become a  slave of the economic powers. They call this agreement contrary  to the farmers' interests. They claim that the result of the  farmers' hard work will be devoured by the foreign companies.  They are also asking while opposing the government that it  should resign since it cannot protect our national interests and  should stay out of this agreement. The talks and debates that  had been going on in our country over the Dunkel proposals for  the last seven years have made the situation even more complex,  instead of clarifying it. The government did not try to clarify  this situation. This made the Dunkel look scary to the nation.  When the Uruguay talks began in 1986, India had strongly opposed  intellectual asset rights, use of services, and rules for  investment, and had asked that these be kept out of the  proposals. It was neither supported nor approved. India demanded  that clothes trade be made a part of the agreement, however,  because of the direct and strong opposition by the United  States, it was kept out. India has to be satisfied with begging  for mercy. Commerce Minister Pranab Mukherji is correct in  saying that give and take is required in international  agreements. However, what did we get in exchange for what we  gave? All we see are empty promises and serious challenges. This  naturally augments suspicions and fears. The fact is that our  nation's economic future has become uncertain instead of  becoming secure. In the chess game of Uruguay talks, the group  of industrialized nations have set in and the pawns of  developing countries like India are being beaten. A year ago,  there was a fear that a trade war will start among the affluent  nations. This has gone now and is replaced by the fear that  exploitation of developing countries will increase.    India is an agricultural nation. Its economy is based on  agricultural production. Therefore, the interests of the farmers  cannot be neglected at any cost. Commerce Minister Pranab  Mukherji has tried to assure the Parliament that full attention  will be given to such important issues as government subsidy to  the farmers, public distribution system, patenting of seeds, and  drug prices. The farmers will have the right to store seeds, use  them again, and barter with each others. Not only this, they  will have the right to sell their products in any international  market. The agreement does not have much responsibility for  naturally developed genes and the patenting the genetic process.  There are no restrictions on investment policies. Still, Mr.  Mukherji has not answer to the fear that this agreement will  affect drug prices. The government says that it will control  prices by encouraging production of domestic drugs. Whatever  happens now, since we had no alternative but to accept the  Dunkel proposals, we should prepare ourselves for the upcoming  challenges. We can be successful in getting our fair share in  international trade if we are determined and follow the right  path. We must start a major campaign on war footing to make our  economy export oriented. In order to face the unfair situation  created by the affluent nations, we have to expand bilateral  cooperation with some nations. At the same time, we must  strengthen cooperation among the developing nations. All this  cannot be done at once. We will have to work for a long time to  attain it, only then can we be successful. Only a stable  government can do that. Therefore, we must end the efforts to  create political instability.</p>

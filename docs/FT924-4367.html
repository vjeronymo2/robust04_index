			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / International Company News: Valeo makes Italian unit offer VALEO, the French car components group in which Mr Carlo De Benedetti is the main shareholder through his Cerus holding company, is planning to buy out the minority shareholders in its listed Italian subsidiary. Shares in Valeo SpA were suspended in Milan and Turin yesterday pending details of the offer from the French parent. Under the terms of the transaction, which has still to be approved by Consob, Italy's stock market and companies watchdog, Valeo will buy out the 43.6 per cent of Valeo SpA it does not already own via a share swap and a balancing cash adjustment. Details will not be released until Consob gives its approval. Somes brokers criticised it because minority shareholders were not being offered a cash alternative. Valeo, which made net profits of FFr545m (Dollars 100m) on sales of FFr19.87bn last year, said eliminating the minorities in its Italian operation would boost net consolidated profits by between FFr1 and FFr2 a share. The group has sharply raised earnings this year in spite of weak demand.</p>

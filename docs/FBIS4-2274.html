			<p>BFN     [Text] Shenyang, April 7 (XINHUA) -- The sky is clearer  and the air cleaner in Shenyang, this once pollution-ridden  capital of northeast China's Liaoning Province, according to the  city's environmental agency.    Shenyang is one of the most important heavy industrial  centers in China. The city's gross national product grew at an  average annual rate of 15.6 percent to reach 37.45 billion yuan  in 1993, an increase of 26 billion yuan over the 1986 figure.    The results of monitoring by the environmental agency show  that annual mean value of the total suspended particles per  cubic meter of air in 1993 was 0.434 mg, 0.87 mg less than in  1986, the amount of monthly dust fall per square kilometer in  the year was 29.81 tons, 11.2 tons less than eight years ago and  the annual value of the content of sulphur dioxide per standard  square meter in the air was 0.122 mg, 0.037 mg less than eight  years ago.    The city used more than 10 million tons of coal last year,  accounting for 70 percent of the total amount of energy consumed.    The city has been working hard to eliminate pollution  sources, especially soot and dust emitted by factories and  family stoves. Restaurants in urban areas of the city are  required to use clean fuels. More than 3,000 old-fashioned  boilers have been replaced by modern central heating facilities.    Any enterprise whose discharge of wastes and dust exceeds  the  state set standards would be warned or fined.    The city authorities have also encouraged a tree planting  campaign as part of the efforts to improve the environmental  quality.</p>

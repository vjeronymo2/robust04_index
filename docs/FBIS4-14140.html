			<p>BFN     [Text] Textile exports constitute 35 percent of the  country's total exports. The industry is now gearing itself to  boosting exports still further.    [Begin unidentified correspondent recording] India's textile  output has gone up from 25,045 million square meters in 1992-93  to 25,942 million square meters in 1993-94. This is excluding  the production in the khadi, wool, and silk sectors. The steep  rise in production is mainly attributed to an increase in output  by the handloom and power loom sectors which employs 140 lakhs  of people specially in the rural sector. The capital [words  indistinct] sector contributes only 10 percent of the total  production and employs just about 10 lakh people. According to  the annual report of the Textiles Ministry, textile exports  constitute as much as 35 percent of India's total exports.  Textiles have, thus, emerged as one of the highest foreign  exchange earner for the country crossing the 19,000 crore rupee  mark during 1993-94 -- an increase of 34 percent over 1992-93.

			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / The Coal White Paper: Reprieves may not last three years A TRANSFORMATION in the British coal industry was set in motion by yesterday's white paper. But in three years' time the industry under British Coal - or its successors after the privatisation promised yesterday - may be little different in size and efficiency from what the government envisaged before the pit crisis developed. Public pressure has forced a reprieve for most of the 31 pits originally earmarked for closure. But in many cases the reprieve will be temporary and in some cases it will last perhaps less than a year. Radical changes in working practices were outlined in the white paper. For example the 1908 restriction on hours worked underground will be removed. But privatisation may have made these changes inevitable. The changes will help British Coal to become more competitive, but it will struggle to match the prices of its international competitors by the time of privatisation, probably in two or three years. If it proves impossible, PowerGen and National Power will look abroad once more for whatever coal they need above the 'base tonnage' contracts that must be signed by the end of the month. By 1995 the coal industry will have to compete with increasing amounts of nuclear power and, more importantly, gas-fired electricity. The chances of keeping all 31 surviving pits open after two years, let alone re-opening the seven which were mothballed yesterday, seem remote. Negotiations between British Coal and the electricity generators will continue on additional tonnages above the base contracts. There was nothing in yesterday's document, however, likely to persuade the electricity industry to take anything like the 65.5m tonnes over five years which the government originally hoped for. Even 40m tonnes will be difficult following the imposition of value added tax on domestic fuel prices, which will depress the demand for coal. What has become clear, however, is that the government is setting a course for gradual privatisation of the coal industry by selling off both the 12 pits which are definitely to close and the seven which are to be mothballed. In the meantime British Coal's powers over potential competitors will be reduced by the establishment of an independent coal authority, which will take over the corporation's role of supervising licensees. British Coal was sanguine about the white paper's outcome. Mr Neil Clarke, chairman, said: 'We accept that the white paper represents the best outcome from the review that can be achieved.' British Coal anticipates that the closure of the two collieries and the mothballing of the seven will lead to the loss of about 5,800 jobs. This compares with more than 30,000 envisaged in October, although more than 8,000 have left the industry since then.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Michael Heseltine Trade &amp; industry secretary  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 'I have done all that I reasonably could, consistent with economic realities and legal constraints, to increase the opportunities for British Coal. The outcome will be settled. . .in the market place.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Norman Willis TUC general secretary  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 'The White Paper is a deliberate deception. What is on offer is nothing more than a political confidence trick which seeks to cover up the truth that in two years the British coal industry will be dead and buried.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Neil Clarke Chairman British Coal  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 'With the assistance of Government funding, we will be doing our utmost to secure additional sales. . .British Coal sees nothing in the White Paper to alter its current proposals'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- John Collier Nuclear Electric Chairman  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 'It lays the foundation for a balanced energy policy which offers security of supply and the benefits of competition, but which also guarantees a role for our indigenous sources of power'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Robin Cook Labour trade &amp; industry spokesman  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 'The House has just heard a comprehensive admission of failure. It will not buy off the nation, who will not forgive the government for abandoning Europe's richest coal reserves.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Cedric Brown Managing director of British Gas  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 'We welcome the announcement which represents a fair balance between energy supplies and recognises the vital contribution which gas can make to jobs, the economy and the environment.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Malcolm Edwards Former commercial director British Coal  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 'All we can do is express a genuine commercial interest and say what could be done by the private sector. Coal buyers have had their fill of British Coal over the last six months.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Richard Caborn Chairman trade &amp; industry select committee  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 'All 31 pits could be closed in three to four years' time. That is going to cost the British taxpayer Pounds 2 billion. This year there could be 18 pits closed, and 18,300 jobs lost'  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

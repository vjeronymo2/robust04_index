			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Lucia Dubon from the "News Patrol" newscast] </F>   [Text] We are starting to receive the first reactions from  the political world to the murder of Constitutionality Court  President Epaminondas Gonzalez Dubon. We now have statements  from National Congress President Vinicio Villar Anleu condemning  the murder.    [Begin Villar recording] That is correct. In all actuality,  once more, we must condemn these violent incidents taking place  in our country. We are not just condemning the violent act  against Constitutionality Court President Epaminondas Gonzalez,  but acts aganst any human being, any Guatemalan.    I believe we are still living in a time in which all  Guatemalans must reflect, ponder, and try to live in a state of  law where the law will be respected over everything else, and I  think we must not take the law into our own hands. This is a  very unfortunate incident. As National Congress president, I  would like to take the opportunity to express my condolences to  the relatives of Mr. Epaminondas Gonzalez, and most naturally to  all of Guatemala for these violent incidents we are experiencing  -- all of which are very unfortunate.    Events like this leave a lot to be desired from a country  seeking to progress through understanding and dialogue. We  oppose this unfortunate act and we strongly condemn it. At the  same time, we call on the executive branch to put a stop to this  rise in criminal activity and to acts of violence against  Guatemala's political and professional sectors. We regret what  has happened and hope the government can rapidly clarify, as is  done in other countries, the origins of this act, of this  violent death that befell the president of the Constitutionality  Court.

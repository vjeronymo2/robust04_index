			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / People: FNFC attracts Ingram back home There will be some who raise their eyebrows at Tim Ingram's decision to chuck up a good career in a beautiful place like Australia and return to the UK to take on the job of finance director of loss-making First National Finance Corporation. However, Ingram feels he is making the right move. At 45, he says that it is too late to emigrate. Having joined Grindlays Bank after leaving Cambridge in 1969, he spent much of his early life running the bank's operations in outlandish places like Zaire, Greece and Cyprus. After ANZ Bank bought Grindlays, he moved to Australia and was put in charge of its ADollars 15bn commercial loan portfolio. But with two children at school in England he felt the urge to return and was tapped for the job by Martin Mays-Smith, FNFC's new chairman and a former colleague from Ingram's early Grindlays' days. Ingram is not an accountant. But Tom Wrigley, FNFC's 55-year-old chief executive, sees nothing unusual in having a banker as finance director. 'The critical part of our operation is on the liability side of the balance sheet,' says Wrigley, who is hoping that Ingram will provide fresh expertise in developing new areas of funding such as securitisation of assets. Keith Dalwood, 59, FNFC's finance director for the past three years, will continue as a director.</p>

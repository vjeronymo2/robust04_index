			<p><P> September 1, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOY, 14, SOUGHT TO JOIN FAMILY IN L.A.;  </P> <P> DEATH AT BORDER SHOWS A DARK SIDE OF AMNESTY  </P> <P> He wanted to be with his father, so 14-year-old Luis Eduardo Hernandez left  home in Mexico's Jalisco state two weeks ago and headed for Los Angeles, where  his father, newly legalized under the amnesty program, works in construction.  </P> <P> Like so many others, Luis Eduardo was filled with hope for a new and better  life as he made the passage north with his brother Angel, 15. And, also like  many others, Luis Eduardo never made it beyond the tumult of the borderlands. A  boy known for his sense of humor and curiosity, he died 30 feet inside the  United States, in San Diego, run over early Aug. 20 by a U.S. Border Patrol  vehicle.  </P> <P> On Thursday, natives of Luis Eduardo's hometown of San Juan de los Lagos --  many now resettled in Boyle Heights -- buried him near the shade of a pepper  tree in Los Angeles' Resurrection Cemetery.  </P> <P> His death, according to immigrant representatives, is a tragic testament to a  darker side of the amnesty program. Now nearly 3 years old, the program has  raised the possibility for permanent legal U.S. residence for more than 3  million people, more than 70% of them from Mexico and half of them residents of  California.  </P> <P> But immigrant rights activists point out that amnesty -- which provided no  automatic benefit for spouses and children of the newly legalized -- also has  served to split families into "legal" and "illegal" members, exacerbating the  already deep divisions of the Mexican diaspora. Existing legal immigration  procedures can leave families divided for a decade or more.  </P> <P> "No one is going to agree to be separate from their families," said Rodolfo  Padilla, an uncle of the dead boy, as he stood outside the funeral home where  the boy's remains lay Thursday. He pointed to his nearby preteen daughter, all  smiles and little-girl frills.  </P> <P> "My little girl," Padilla said, gesturing toward the child, "she crossed  illegally, too."  </P> <P> Amnesty, according to the Mexican consul general in San Diego, has prompted a  huge increase in the number of unaccompanied minors, like Luis Eduardo, who are  arriving at the border with the intention of joining newly legalized parents.  The children, in groups and alone, can be seen nightly in Tijuana, crouching  along the tattered fence that marks the international boundary, frightened but  anxious for a chance to dart into the opportunity of the north.  </P> <P> "We see them every day," said Marcela Merino, a Mexican consular official in  San Diego. "They only want to be with their parents."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Face Range of Hazards  </P> <P> At the border, they face a range of hazards, from unscrupulous smugglers,  professional thieves, extortion-minded Mexican police and the intimidating grid  of high-speed roadways that converge on Tijuana from San Diego. More than two  dozen undocumented immigrants -- some of them children -- were struck by  vehicles and killed as they walked along the border highways in San Diego last  year.  </P> <P> The Border Patrol's motorized fleet adds to the danger, critics say. In the  last four years, according to a San Diego human rights coalition, the patrol's  vehicles have run over and killed at least six migrants in the  California-Mexico border region. There have been calls for greater safety  procedures.  </P> <P> In the case of Luis Eduardo, U.S. authorities describe the incident as an  unfortunate but unavoidable accident: The boy was running just north of the  border fence when he fell in the path of the vehicle, which was traveling at 10  to 15 m.p.h. and was unable to stop, according to the Border Patrol, a  uniformed enforcement arm of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service.  </P> <P> Michael D. Padilla, a San Diego attorney representing the Hernandez family,  asserted that the vehicle was driving at an excessive rate of speed. He plans a  civil claim.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Express Little Rancor  </P> <P> Mourners for Luis Eduardo, who clearly believed that the boy had been the  victim of an injustice, expressed little rancor. Most had themselves crossed  the border at Tijuana at one time or another, and all seem to recognize the  dangers -- and the reality that not all can make it. It is unfair, they say,  but true.  </P> <P> "We take great risks and expose ourselves to great dangers to come here," said  Padilla, Luis Eduardo's uncle. "One risks one's life because in Mexico there is  nothing for us any more."  </P> <P> Some, such as Jose Munoz, a native of San Juan de los Lagos who has lived in  Los Angeles for 30 years, spoke of the need for greater safeguards.  </P> <P> "Something like this should never have been allowed to happen," said Munoz, a  laborer who has emerged as somewhat of a community activist among the San  Juaneros, immigrants from San Juan, who clearly respect his studied thoughts  and opinions.  </P> <P> "Supposedly," he said, "these agents are properly trained to deal with people,  and then this happens."  </P> <P> The decision to bury Luis Eduardo in Los Angeles was made in the hope that the  family might someday be together in the city and be able to visit the grave  site.  </P> <P> A wake was held Wednesday night. Luis Eduardo lay in a felt-lined wooden casket  as his family and former neighbors prayed. The body was dressed in a blue shirt  and new blue jeans. Bruises, apparently from the accident, were still evident  on the boy's face.  </P> <P> Thursday morning, there was another church service, preceding the burial.  During his low-key eulogy at the Roman Catholic Church at Our Lady of the  Rosary of Talpa, Father Honorio Lopez touched gently on the theme of  "injustice" as he addressed the gathering of about 120 mourners. He consoled  the family with images of a heavenly reunion.  </P> <P> Too distraught to speak publicly were Luis Eduardo's parents, Aurelio and  Amelia, and his three brothers and two sisters. The mother and other children  had received temporary visas so they could travel legally to Los Angeles for  the funeral. The visas expire later this month, and then they must return to  Mexico.  </P></p>

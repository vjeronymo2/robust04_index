			<p><P> September 15, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MYSTERY WOMAN  </P> <P> Two-and-a-half years ago, we went to the Los Angeles Opera's "Tristan &amp;  Isolde." We were late in ordering our tickets and so wound up in row U at the  leftmost edge.  </P> <P> In an orchestral passage of the first act, an elderly lady of aristocratic mien  got up from the middle of row U and edged her way out, murmuring apologies on  the way. Near the end of the intermission, she asked us whether we would  exchange our seats with those of her and her companion (a younger woman). We  replied that of course, we would be glad to do so, but that one couldn't see  the subtitles from our seats because of the balcony overhang. Whereupon she  replied that she did not need to see them: She knew the opera by heart, having  sung it at Covent Garden. Her problem was that, in subconsciously vocalizing  with the soprano, she built up a need to cough.  </P> <P> We were of course quite overwhelmed by this explanation but lacked the presence  of mind to ask her name. Do you have any idea who she was?  </P> <P> WILLIAM KAULA  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P> <P> Martin Bernheimer suggests that perhaps the woman was Dame Eva Turner, who  recently died at age 98.  </P> <P> </P></p>

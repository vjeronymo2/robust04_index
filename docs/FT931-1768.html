			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / BT sale managers poised to compete REGIONAL lead managers in the UK government's forthcoming sale of BT shares are expected to compete with each other to sign up institutional shareholders. For the first time in any UK privatisation, the Treasury is considering having one global offer with 10 regional managers competing to get institutions around the world to put in bids for BT shares. The government is expected to sell most, if not all, of its 22 per cent BT shareholding, which is worth Pounds 5.5bn. The sale may take place as early as July. It yesterday expanded its share shop scheme, set up as part of the second tranche of BT shares sold in 1991. In the last BT sale the institutional offer was split between 10 syndicates throughout the world in which the lead managers had exclusive rights, apart from the global co-ordinator, to market the shares. The government has already decided to reduce the number of syndicates and may abolish them in favour of a single global market. Regional managers would still be appointed to look after retail demand. But they would be expected to compete with other regional managers to sign up institutional investors. International sales have already moved away from giving as many as 10 regional managers exclusive rights to drum up institutional support. Although no decision has been taken on the timing of the BT sale, SG Warburg, the government's lead adviser, said the earliest date was in July, with a marketing campaign starting in the last week of May. Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, yesterday invited 100 banks, building societies and stockbrokers to participate as share shops. This compares with eight 'preferred retailers' in the last BT sale. Once a member of the public registers with a share shop, the bank or stockbroker will be able to start marketing other share offers unconnected with the BT sale. In the last sale share shops had to wait until after the flotation before offering small BT shareholders inducements to buy shares in other companies. Mr Dorrell said: 'The plans are designed to further the government's commitment to wider and deeper share ownership.'</p>

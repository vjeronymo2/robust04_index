Yet every stroke a karate player makes is intended to  hurt his opponent and make him fall. He relies on his own  strength which cannot be questioned in the least.    It seems that the United States and Japan, the two economic  superpowers, also have been playing "karate" these days. The  United States, which is running a trade deficit of nearly $60  billion with Japan, was unable to free itself from being held by  Japan by the side of its waist. Now, Clinton has lifted up the  big stick of "Super 301" and Japan can do nought but back away.  Five days before the big stick hit, Japan made concessions on  the question of the U.S. Motorola Telecommunications  Corporation's access to the main part of its mobile phone  market, thus temporarily avoiding a vicious war. But has the  storm subsided? People withg an understanding of the issue  would say: It may not have.    What is "Super 301?" It came into being six years ago and is  an amendment to article 301 of the "1974 U.S. Trade Act." The  amendment provides that the United States can carry out  investigations of and talks with, within limited periods, any  country whose trade behavior it regards as "unfair" and  "illegal" and, if the talks fail, it can unilaterally adopt  compulsory retaliatory measures.    However, just at the end of last year, over 100 countries  signed the GATT Uruguay Round Multilateral Trade Negotiations  Agreements in Geneva, which urged all countries to resolve  global trade disputes through participation and cooperation.  But now, the United States has openly threatened Japan with  unilateral sanctions and the agreements are freshly made.  Public opinion around the world maintains that Clinton has  violated competition laws and regulations. In this regard,  countries like Australia, Britain, and France have made loud  noises. The Australian Trade Minister McMullan [mai ke ma lun  7796 0344 7456 0243] [Bureau records show Peter Cook as  Australian Trade Minister] pointed out that forcing Japan to  increase imports of U.S. products by compulsory means will  undoubtedly sacrifice the interests of other countries.  European countries like Britain and France are currently  experiencing acute trade friction with the United States and are  overtly and covertly receiving similar threats from the United  States. Therefore, their criticisms are particularly sharp.  French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur even criticized the  United States for pursuing trade hegemony and seriously damaging  the international free trade system.    Given the fact that "Super 301" has caused Japan to make  some  concessions within a few days and the strong responses this has  evoked around the world, can it really radically change the  United States' trade deficit with Japan? The answer is that it  may not. In fact, "Super 301" directly originated with the  Japanese-U.S. trade frictions and with the absence of progress  in trade talks. The United States also directed it at Japan when  it made use of the article last time and succeeded in forcing  Japan to open its timber, supercomputer, and satellite markets.  Despite this, the United States has kept an increasingly large  trade deficit running with Japan. The dispute has already been  brewing for quite some time. Moreover, the concessions Japan has  made under pressure from the United States are merely one aspect  of their trade dispute. The "victory" Clinton has won by using  the big stick in violation of the rules will probably be only  good enough for him to win a few votes in the upcoming interim  elections.    On the last two occasions the United States brandished the  big stick of "Super 301," it only lifted it up but did not  strike anyone. The interests of Japan and the United States are  intertwined. In playing karate they have to be serious, while  also having to be not so serious, and each side has to hit the  other's vital parts while not hurting itself. Only the two  countries themselves have a tacit understanding of their own  interests and own advances and withdrawals.</p>

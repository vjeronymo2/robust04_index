			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Ivan Horsky: "Wake After Teasing?; </F> Hungarian-Slovak Dialogue Diverted Into a Blind Alley"]    [Text] Slovak-Hungarian relations have in recent days and  weeks become the center of a media war, particularly with regard  to the solution of minority issues. People with weaker nerves  may have even perceived this as an exchange of fire. The live  ammunition was supplied by both sides, which have been  exploiting the insufficient solution of this undeniably  controversial problem for political manipulation in their own  favor.    This is the main reason why, in both Hungary and Slovakia,  executive as well as legislative bodies deliberately do not  bring the whole matter to the required end. Naturally, this  then creates scope for artificial escalation of tension, the  whipping up of emotions, and fishing in muddy waters, the result  of which is the almost absolute absence of trust on both sides,  but also between the state and the minorities living on its  territory.    As far as Budapest is concerned, the present Hungarian  Democratic Forum-led government coalition can scarcely be  expected to change its course less than four months before the  elections. The overt support that it provides to the political  representatives of the Hungarian minority in Slovakia, while at  the same time vehemently rejecting even the slightest hint that  the positions of the two sides are being coordinated, testifies  to the opposite.    There would be nothing wrong with this if the positions of  the two largest parties representing the Hungarian minority were  clear and transparent. Their eternal shifts, the hardening and  then again softening of their positions, depending evidently on  the response they are getting from abroad, make it impossible  for their negotiating partners to assume an unequivocal stand.  It must be said, however, for the sake of objectivity, that  this negotiating partner [the Slovak Government] has at present  no intention of holding talks because this allows him to arouse  in society fears of a potential external threat to the integrity  of the state and to declare himself the sole guarantor that the  state will be saved--not to mention the fact that this attitude  allows him to use the argument, also vis-a-vis the world, that  it is because of this threat that Slovakia cannot meet all the  commitments it has adopted or the deadline for their fulfillment.    Both sides use the minority issue as a hostage of their  policies or politicking. They assume the posture of someone who  has been wronged, a posture, however, that is meant only for a  part of the gullible domestic audience. The world somehow does  not swallow this bait. At the same time, it is evident that  both Bratislava and Budapest are in for the same measure of  criticism. Only we are trying to persuade ourselves that we are  being wronged by everyone. If this actually happens, it is only  because we are shooting ourselves in the foot.    It can be assumed that the two sides will hold on to their  present policies at least until May, or until the formation of a  new Hungarian government. Although such tests of the other  side's nerves are not uncommon in politics, they do have their  risks, which are not exactly small. A small incident, even a  staged one, may be enough to set off a widespread conflagration.  Fortunately, nothing of the sort has happened yet. Ordinary  people apparently have more common sense than their governments.    I only hope that talks will not start only after the first  electric transmission lines are blown up or after state symbols  are attacked in some other way, as was the case, for example, in  South Tyrol in the 1960's. The time factor, too, must be taken  into consideration. Italy's nonobservance of the Paris Treaty  demonstrated that delaying a solution may be a useless display  of stubbornness. Ultimately, internal and external pressures  led to dialogue and to the search for solutions acceptable to  all interested parties, after all. At the same time, the case  of South Tyrol cannot be considered a model that lends itself to  automatic adoption.    No such model exists. What one can do, however, is learn a  lesson about what not to do and what to do and how. Using the  good services offered by the South Tyroleans would do no harm,  either, to prevent teasing from being followed by wake [pun  based on the similarity between the words "prekaracky" (teasing)  and "karacky" (wake held for a dead person)] and, on top of  that, exchanges of fire or acts of terrorism.</p>

			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Bank deputy in plea on jobs MR RUPERT Pennant-Rea, deputy governor of the Bank of England, yesterday issued a powerful plea for a reduction of unemployment in Europe. He said governments must tackle the problem through long-term reforms of trade and labour policy rather than by cutting interest rates. In his first formal speech since taking office earlier this year, Mr Pennant-Rea said western Europe was the only part of the industrialised world where the level of unemployment had progressively risen in the past two decades. The deputy governor told a conference organised by the Italian Chamber of Commerce: 'No one, no European certainly, can take much comfort from economic conditions in Europe so long as 17.5m people unemployed remains part of the tally.' Mr Pennant-Rea acknowledged that tight monetary policy could be a reason for the continuing level of unemployment in some European countries. But he warned against thinking that high interest rates were the fundamental cause of the problem. Instead, he suggested addressing the issue by looking at microeconomic reforms in taxation, training and wage regulation. Mr Pennant-Rea pointed to the need to continue liberalising trade policy, and warned against turning the European Community into a fortress against other trading blocs. He said: 'To single out trade as a destroyer of jobs is perverse. It neglects the competitive dynamism that trade injects into every trading economy.' He also said reform was needed in labour market policy, in contrast to European Community leaders who are committed to protective employment. 'There are many types of supply-side restraints. Europeans will have to tackle these restraints if we are to be as successful in creating jobs as the US has been in recent years,' he said.</p>

			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> LEMOND STRUGGLING IN CLIMB BACK TO TOP  </P> <P> The ceremony is now familiar. The cyclists gather at the starting line,  politicians are introduced, an announcer plugs the race sponsors and Greg  LeMond steps forward to receive the loudest cheers.  </P> <P> "It's nice," he says. "But it's also embarrassing."  </P> <P> The American who conquered Paris is back home, more popular than ever, but  struggling to regain the form that propelled him to the 1986 Tour de France  title. Clearly, LeMond is the marquee figure of the inaugural Tour de Trump.  Plainly, he is struggling.  </P> <P> Monday, he was ill.  </P> <P> LeMond issued a speech of concession while lying on a bed in his hotel room. He  was weary from the flu and exhausted after the tour's third stage, a 116.3-mile  leg from Allentown, Pa., through the Lehigh Valley to the Market Square Bridge  finish in Harrisburg.  </P> <P> "I had a fever and woke up five to 10 times during the night," LeMond said.  "I'm just not feeling healthy. This is all much harder than I thought it would  be."  </P> <P> After 5 hours, 30 minutes and 45 seconds of pack tactics, Eric Vanderaerden, a  Belgian competing for the Dutch-based team Panasonic-Isostar, edged Soviet  amateur Viatcheslav Ekimov to win a field sprint involving 54 cyclists. LeMond  showed up 71st.  </P> <P> "I've got to stick with it," LeMond said. "I need to race, and it's important  for me to finish."  </P> <P> LeMond has virtually no chance of claiming the neon pink leader's jersey. Dag  Otto Lauritzen, a Norwegian who competes for 7-Eleven, kept the jersey for the  second straight day with a combined time of 15:51:02. LeMond is 6:53 behind.  </P> <P> "It would take a miracle to take that much time off Lauritzen," LeMond said.  </P> <P> LeMond, of course, is accustomed to performing miracles in cycling. He was the  first American to crash the European domination of the sport, living in Belgium  and challenging the world's best racers on their own turf. The pay-off came at  the 1986 Tour de France, when LeMond finally silenced his European critics and  emerged as the first American-born champion.  </P> <P> But he had little time to enjoy his success. On April 21, 1987, LeMond was  nearly killed when he was shot by his brother-in-law in a hunting accident.  </P> <P> "We were hunting for wild turkeys," said LeMond, who still has 30 buckshot  pellets in his body. "I was the turkey."  </P> <P> During his lengthy physical recovery, LeMond said his attitude about the sport  changed. Cycling no longer dominated his life.  </P> <P> "It's kind of like I was hit from the top and knocked to the bottom," he said.  "That's the way it is in life. I could have been paralyzed. I could have been  in a wheelchair. I could have died. I'm lucky to be here."  </P> <P> Still, LeMond was determined to make a comeback. Injuries curtailed his  performances in the last year, and he has enjoyed only nine months of  uninterrupted training.  </P> <P> "In Europe, they always write you off," he said. "Two months after my accident,  the writers there said I was finished."  </P> <P> LeMond is out to prove his critics wrong. He is 27, prepared to enter what  could become the best years of his racing career. The Tour de Trump was  supposed to be his catapult back to the top. Instead, he has dropped back.  </P> <P> "There are difficult times even now," he said. "When you're on top and all of a  sudden you're out, you only remember the good times, not what it took to get  there. There are times when you're impatient."  </P> <P> Still, he seems to enjoy a good life, splitting time between homes in suburban  Minneapolis and Belgium. He plays golf, goes fishing, eats ice cream and drives  a Range Rover. He has a comfortable six-figure income from his contract with  the newly created Coors Light-ADR team.  </P> <P> But money and fame create pressure. The race is always on to win . . . now.  </P> <P> "We're not robots," he said. "We're not always at our best."  </P> <P> Despite the flu and the harsh fact that he can't win the Tour de Trump, LeMond  will continue to race. Tuesday's fourth stage is another difficult test, a  111.5-mile ride from Gettysburg, Pa., through the western Maryland towns of  Emmitsburg, Thurmont, Wolfsville, Middletown and Brunswick, and on to a finish  in Winchester, Va.  </P></p>

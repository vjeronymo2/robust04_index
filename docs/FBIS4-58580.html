			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin with </F> foreign and domestic correspondents in Cairo -- live; passages  within slantlines in English]    [Text] [Rabin] Good afternoon. As you well know, the  first stage of the negotiations on the implementation of the  Declaration of Principles [DOP] ended today. The negotiations  lasted seven months. This duration can be in part explained by  the fact that we, naturally, wanted to reach a detailed  agreement which would clarify in no uncertain terms the complex  fabric of peaceful coexistence for two entities that -- as is  well known -- have no love relationship, to put it mildly. This  was done to implement the conceptual gist of the interim  agreement. The interim agreement consists of two parts: giving  the Palestinians authority to run their lives; and giving  ourselves responsibility for Israel's external security, and  defense of the settlements including settlers' movements within  the territories. Gaza and Jericho is the first stage of the  interim agreement. This was done to ascertain how the system  functions, and it required dealing with numerous details. Today  you were again made aware of the nature of the negotiations,  their occasional deviations and repetitions. Therefore, I  really regard the agreement and the accompanying maps as a basis  that allows for the implementation of the concept's nucleus for  the Palestinians to run their lives while we ensure the security  of the State of Israel and its citizens.    Naturally, the key does not lie in the agreements alone, but  also in their implementation. We are interested in relatively  short implementation period. It became apparent to me last  night that the PLO chairman is asking for several more weeks,  two or three, for an overlapping period. We will probably have  to agree to this, provided an overlap indeed takes place. I  understand that today, 22 Palestinian policemen were supposed to  begin manning the points and regions of coordination so that the  policemen are received in an orderly manner. I hope that people  will also be sent who are able to assume responsibility for  running civilian life. I wish to point out: Today, in Gaza  alone, 24,000 Palestinians receive their salary from the civil  administration; 6,000 are permanent employees, and 18,000 are  employed on a temporary basis to prevent the closure from  causing economic distress that could create a security problem.  The PLO has limited experience in running a community. There  are people there who are able. I hope that the appropriate  people arrive or are found in place, and indeed the handing over  of the civilian and security issues is done properly. I mainly  speak of the Gaza Strip, where some 750,000 Palestinians reside.  In the entire Gaza region, there are more or less 16,000  residents, which is naturally much smaller [sentence and figure  as heard]. The territory of Gaza that would be handed over to  the /Palestinian Authority/ does not include a single Israeli  settlement. Therefore, the problems there are much simpler.    [Shlomo Raz, Qol Israel] Does the incident that took place  on the stage during the signing ceremony not make you wonder  about the ability to implement the agreement? Does it not make  you regret the entire move?    [Rabin] There are no regrets, although during the past  several months we learned that problems come up on occasion.  Then, if we make our position unequivocally clear, we overcome  the problems.    [Raz] Mr. Prime Minister, how do you intend to handle the  negotiations with Syria following the agreement with the PLO?  How much will this agreement influence the negotiations with  Syria?    [Rabin] These are two separate negotiation tracks. The  secretary of state visited our region. We raised several ideas.  We received responses which, without exaggeration, revealed  large gaps between our fundamental positions and theirs.  Nevertheless, the secretary of state will probably return to  our region in two weeks. If there is no change in the Syrian  positions then a waiting period clearly lies ahead until their  positions change because there are certain things that no  Israeli Government can accept.    [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. Prime Minister, can the  principle of a certain area first also be applied on the Golan  Heights?    [Rabin] I think that this constitutes an unsuccessful  attempt to link today's very meaningful withdrawal from Gaza and  Jericho first to something which is ultimately related to the  last line of withdrawal [pauses] -- because as you know, this  government has accepted the principle of territorial compromise  and withdrawal -- certainly from part of the Golan Heights -- in  exchange for peace. We also implemented a withdrawal in the  case of Egypt without linking the issue to the last line of  withdrawal from Egyptian territory. This is a different matter  than Gaza and Jericho First.    [Imanu'el Rosen, Israel Television Channel 2] What would  have  happened had 'Arafat continued to refuse to sign the maps?    [Rabin] I think I made myself very clear to everyone there.  I said that I would not make a speech and there would be no  agreement.    [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. Prime Minister, perhaps you  can give us an authoritative explanation of what happened on the  podium today? What was the cause of the misunderstanding?    [Rabin] I want to make something very clear. Perhaps the  media overplayed reports that two central and dramatic issues  were slated to be resolved in the meeting between 'Arafat and  myself: the policeman on the bridge, and the expansion of the  Jericho area. I think that in all truth -- not only because of  us and perhaps mostly due to no fault of our own -- we devoted  too much time to symbolic matters while the major problems of  what would happen in the Gaza Strip where 750,000 Palestinians  live in poverty; the problem of how to establish a system  capable of maintaining public order and assuming its security  responsibilities; the question of how to prepare for assuming  control over the area.... [pauses]. As I mentioned earlier,  the Civil Administration currently pays the salaries of 24,000  wage earners in the Gaza Strip alone. Who will pay their  salaries when we leave tomorrow or in one week? Who has made  preparations to pay their salaries? Is there any institutional  structure capable of assuming the responsibility? In the past I  was firmly opposed to a unilateral withdrawal from the Gaza  Strip. The reason was first and foremost that we would be  blamed for the chaos, reciprocal killings, and other negative  developments that could ensue if we implemented a rapid  unilateral withdrawal from the Gaza Strip without the presence  of a party capable of assuming minimal security responsibilities  -- and there is no such party. Who is capable of assuming  minimal security responsibilities for the most immediate and  vital necessities in the Gaza Strip? If we do not supply power  there is no electricity in the Gaza Strip. If we do not supply  it there is no water in the Gaza Strip. If we do not supply the  hospitals with oxygen tanks then I do not know what would happen  there. If we suddenly cut off the supply of medicine and drugs  -- and there is no one there willing and capable of assuming  responsibility -- then that might possibly obligate us today to  drag out the process of our withdrawal from the Gaza Strip far  longer than we would have wanted. Because our Palestinian  partner was apparently busy with other things and less  interested in sending people to the area to start overlapping in  order to assume responsibility. Computers perhaps are the only  field today in which some degree of overlap has taken place to  some extent. That is the problem.    [Rabin] /As you are fully aware we signed today the  agreement about Gaza-Jericho first, which is the first phase of  the implementation of the DOP signed last September in  Washington. I believe the minor incident that took place on the  platform shows to you the difficulties that we experienced in  the last over seven months of negotiations of the detailed  implementation of the first phase -- the Gaza-Jericho agreement.  Why we stressed on preparing an agreement which all the details  that we considered to be vital to its success must be worked  out. We are trying here to create peaceful coexistence between  two entities that there is no love lost between them -- and I  put it mildly. The purpose is to create the kind of peaceful  coexistence that on one hand the Palestinian authority will run  the lives of the Palestinians in the agreed areas: the Gaza  Strip and Jericho. The main problem is in Jericho, it is  750,000 Palestinians vis a vis 16,000 to 20,000 in the Jericho  area [sentence as heard]. The economic difficulties are much  bigger in the Gaza Strip. We want to maintain security.  Security to the State of Israel -- that is to say external  security. We agreed with the Palestinians in the DOP about  having the settlements. Therefore, we are carrying the overall  responsibility for the settlements in the territories,  especially in the Gaza Strip -- in the Jericho area there are no  Israeli settlements-- and of course, to their movement from the  settlements to Israel or passing, like in Jericho, from the  northern part into Jerusalem. We knew that unless everything  will be prepared in detail there will be no chance to succeed to  build this peaceful coexistence.    /Second, we found that much time was lost without  overlapping  activities on their part. It starts only today when 22 officers  of their police will go there. We have to build and to create  three centers of coordination: two in the Gaza Strip and one in  Jericho, through which coordination between the Israeli military  forces and the Palestinian police and other security activities  will be coordinated otherwise the clashes can create a real  problem. Therefore, we did not lose time. After all, we could  complete the handing over from our own part in two, three weeks  from today. It might be even in ten days. The problem today,  as the chairman of the PLO said last night or deep in the night,  is that he might demand little bit more: two, three even up to  four weeks. We would like once we have reached agreement to get  out as quickly as possible from wherever we have to get out.  But we have an address, a capable address to hand over  responsibility to the life of the Palestinians in the  territories. Just to give you one example: We today pay to the  Civil Administration under the military government of Israel in  the Gaza Strip for 24,000 people. Six thousand permanent  employees of the Civil Administration, for 18,000 a special  budget was appropriated to prevent too high unemployment, the  kind that would increase as a result of the closure on the  territories. But we do not want the economic situation to  develop in a way that it will create security risks for us.  Tomorrow, we will leave. Who will pay these 24,000 people?  [passage indistinct]    [Rabin, continues] /...from the outside, most of the people  that have not been for 20 or 27 years in the Gaza Strip or in  Jericho. How long will it take to acquaint themselves with the  new changes in the area? Twenty seven years ago, when we  entered during the Six-Day War to the Gaza Strip, there were  less than 300,000 people there. Today it is three quarters of a  million, if not 800,000. There are practical problems that,  unfortunately, focus was not given enough in proper preparation  for the handing over. We will have now to waste time, from our  point of view, because for whatever we have agreed and for  wherever we have agreed to pull out, we are ready to do it as  quickly as possible. We will wait to see, today, tomorrow, the  day after. Hopefully the infrastructure, the overlapping will  be done in proper way. And we are committed toward what we  signed today. We know that the partner is not accustomed to be  responsible to life of community. It has limited experience in  certain issues, but there are very capable Palestinians, and I  believe there is no shortage of capable people there, if they  have the determination and the guidance to what has been agreed  on./    [Unidentified correspondent] /Did Mr. 'Arafat tell you  last night that he would not sign the map...?    [Rabin, interrupting] /I will explain what happened.  Unfortunately, the media in the last three months built up two  issues that would be decided in the meeting between Chairman  'Arafat and myself: One is the Palestinian police on the  bridge, one is the size of the Jericho area. Believe me, the  two are symbols, for each side might be important, but this is  not the crux of the problem that we face together in  Gaza-Jericho alone. The issues that I referred to -- how to  maintain the life of the Palestinians, to develop them  economically, socially; the question of security -- these are  the two issues that will decide the success or the failure of  the attempt that we are engaged in. But the media built it, and  I was limited by the principles that I was guided by them when  we decided on Jericho in addition to Gaza -- that it will be a  limited area; that it will not include any Israeli settlement,  in contradiction to the Gaza Strip. Second, for me, security  along the lines, external lines, it is to say that the external  security interpretation, especially along the Jordan River, is  an issue of great concern. Therefore I could not meet his  expectations. He brought up another issue: Special  arrangements in the Rafah terminal, and he demanded that there,  the director general will be Palestinian. I could not meet  this. [passage indistinct]    [Rabin continues] /...we signed the agreement on the basis  of my position. It is to say: we added a certain amount of area  to Jericho area as it was described before yesterday, and I  agreed that we can continue the discussions on the issues but,  when we sign, it will be on the basis of my answers. How it was  ended? First I made it clear that unless the maps will not be  signed there will be no agreement and I will not speak./  [passage indistinct]    [Rabin continues] /...I agreed that the discussions on these  issues will be continued without affecting the implementation of  the agreement -- based on what we know last night. I agreed to  send a letter in which I will say that there will be continued  discussions on these three issues./    [Unidentified correspondent] [Question indistinct]    [Rabin] /I am sure that from the side of the Palestinians,  it looks to a dramatic change in their lives. For the first  time, the Palestinians will run large communities in what used  to be British-mandated Palestine. From our point of view, the  main test is security... [transmission interrupted]    [Rabin continues]/...we know that the issue of Jerusalem  will be brought up in accordance to what we signed in the DOP.  It is to say: Not later than two years after the completion of  the implementation of Gaza-Jericho First. Jerusalem will not be  discussed when we negotiate the second phase of the interim  agreement, the elections, the final composition of the  Palestinian authority, and the future of Judaea and Samaria.  For me.... [break in reception]    [Rabin continues] /...some people did not believe Israel is  serious in its readiness to go along with what we were committed  to. But we, when we say, we mean it. Second, I believe that the  question of the money was understood by us for a long time.  This is why Israel's Foreign Minister Peres and others were  active with the countries and organizations.../ [break in  reception]    [Unidentified correspondent] [Indistinct question on the  release of prisoners]    [Rabin] We have understandings and agreements regarding the  release of prisoners, and we will follow them. I would not like  to go into detail on this issue -- not here, not today. As for  the Palestinian, PLO stand, regarding the shape of the permanent  arrangement: You have their stand from the Madrid conference.  They never kept it a secret. We have a different position.  The most important thing now is to concentrate on the issues  included in the DOP for the interim agreement. The first stage  of the interim agreement is Gaza and Jericho First. Let us  prove that we can create that which we have agreed on. Then we  will talk about the end of it.</p>

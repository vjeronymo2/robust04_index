			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Survey of French Finance and Investment (7): Privatisation spurs share ownership / A look at the progress of the government's ambitious programme The bureaucrats at Bercy, the economics and finance ministry in eastern Paris, have reason to be satisfied with the progress of the French government's ambitious privatisation programme. Since Banque Nationale de Paris was dispatched to the private sector in the autumn of last year, the plan to sell all or part of 21 public sector groups has advanced smoothly. Rhone Poulenc, the chemicals group, Elf Aquitaine, the oil company, and Union des Assurances de Paris, the insurer, have followed BNP into private hands, netting the state a cool FFr94.4bn in receipts. The successful start to the programme has important implications. In addition to boosting the government's coffers - a vital element in its budget deficit reduction strategy - the sales of state companies have also spurred private share ownership. A survey sponsored by the Bank of France and the COB, the stock exchange watchdog, shows that privatisations have pushed the number of private shareholders in France from 4.5m in 1992 to 5.7m this year. The revenues, and public interest, are set to continue - for the time being at least. The partial privatisation of Renault, one of the state's most attractive assets, is nearing completion. Aimed at the public, the sale of almost 40 per cent of the capital of the motor group is expected further to boost popular share ownership. In so doing, it should bring the government a further FFr8bn or so in receipts. After Renault, however, the process of privatisation is likely to become more delicate, and more complex. For 1995, as for this year, the government has set a target of FFr55bn for privatisation receipts. But with many of the more attractive assets already sold, and with the stock market in the doldrums, it faces a challenge in maintaining the momentum of its privatisation drive. Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economics minister, is taking steps to prepare the next candidates for sale. He has launched the process of selecting adviser banks for the privatisation of Seita, the state tobacco monopoly which manufactures such famous brands as Gitanes and Gauloises. Two insurance groups, Assurance Generales de France, and Caisse Nationale de Prevoyance, are both primed for sale, although the latter is expected to remain majority controlled by the French state. The minister has said that he is keen to privatise AGF as soon as possible. But the operation is complicated by the sharp fall in insurance shares this year which has resulted from the decline in bond prices and the consequent impact on the portfolios of insurance groups. AGF, for example, has seen its share price tumble by more than 35 per cent since the beginning of January. For the French government, this poses a dilemma. 'They want to sell AGF, but cannot be seen to flogging off the silverware too cheaply,' says one industry observer. The partial privatisation of CNP is similarly affected by the depressed state of the insurance sector. Such considerations help explain the moves to prepare for a sale of Seita. But in terms of revenues, it is a less lucrative operation. The expected receipts from the sale of the tobacco group, however, which are estimated at about FFr6bn, pale beside the FFr20bn which could come from selling the government's 65 per cent holding in AGF and the receipts from the first batch of privatisations. Elf alone brought FFr35bn to the state's coffers. Beyond the immediate candidates, there are also complications. Many of the larger companies left in the state's corporate portfolio are in need of significant restructuring before they can be offered to private investors. Credit Lyonnais and Air France, for example, continue to incur substantial losses. Usinor Sacilor, Europe's largest steel producer, has burst back into the black after a net deficit of FFr5.7bn last year, but must still reduce its debt burden of FFr20bn before it can be sold. An added headache as the government ponders the next steps in its privatisation programme relates to the weakness of the stock market. The decline in insurance shares, although dramatic, comes against a background of depression on the Paris bourse. The CAC 40 index of leading shares has fallen by about 20 per cent this year as interest rates have headed upwards. As a consequence, all of the privatisation issues, with the exception of BNP, are trading below their issue price. 'The decline in share prices is likely to dampen investor enthusiasm for new issues,' says one Paris stockbroker. 'There are many competing alternatives for their savings which they may find more attractive.' One such is a new scheme which allows individuals to buy directly 10-year government bonds. With yields of about 7.5 per cent, they are proving highly popular. Despite these various challenges, however, the government is optimistic about the future prospects for its privatisation plans. Officials cite the strong demand that the issues have received from individual, institutional and industrial investors and claim that the weakness of the stock market raises the prospect of a strong upswing and hence increased incentives for investors. They add that the recovery in the French economy, which has revived much more dynamically than forecast and is due to grow by 3.1 per cent next year, should ease the process of restructuring for many of the privatisation candidates. 'We will get them in shape for sale,' says one official at the industry ministry. 'Look at how Renault was transformed from a big loss-maker over recent years.' Such transformations, however, take time. The ability of many of the lame ducks of the public sector to turn themselves into swans, and the course of the French and international financial markets over the next few months, will determine whether the government has enough time to achieve its privatisation objectives.  ------------------------------------------------------         GOVERNMENT RECEIPTS FROM PRIVATISATION

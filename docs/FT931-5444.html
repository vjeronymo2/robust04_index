			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / International Company News: Anglovaal holds dividend as earnings fall slightly ANGLOVAAL, one of South Africa's largest mining houses, has maintained its interim dividend for the six months to the end of December despite a small fall in earnings achieved against the background of very difficult trading conditions. The fact that the drop in earnings was relatively small - given a severe decline in economic activity during the half year - was largely attributable to a solid performance from Anglovaal Industries (AVI). Its contribution to group earnings rose by 20 per cent following a 9 per cent increase in AVI's earnings per share and Anglovaal increasing its stake in AVI. Group earnings per share fell by 6 per cent to 226 cents from 240 cents and the dividend is being maintained at 33 cents a share. Turnover rose 5 per cent to R4.3bn (Dollars 1.4bn) from R4.1bn, but tighter margins meant operating profits fell 8 per cent to R344.8m from R376.1m. A 17 per cent increase in investment income, to R26.4m from R22.5m, and a 16 per cent fall in tax to R149.8m from R178.6m lifted net profits marginally to R221.4m from R220m. Increased equity-accounted earnings were offset by a larger share of attributable profits going to outside shareholders. As a result, attributable earnings fell by 5 per cent to R136m from R143.1m. Mr Basil Hersov, chairman, said earnings from the group's mining interests were lower than during the same period in 1991 with both the volume and price of sales under extreme pressure. Associated Manganese Mines of South Africa, the group's largest mining contributor, recently reported a 51 per cent drop in profits. The group said profits from mining would continue to fall unless market conditions improved. With earnings likely to remain under pressure for the next six months, however, Mr Hersov said results for the full year were likely to be slightly lower than in 1992.</p>

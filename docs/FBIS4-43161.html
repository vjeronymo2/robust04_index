			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Veronique Soule: "Anti-Karadzic Serbs Speak Out"] </F>   [Text] The one-month cease-fire agreed on 8 June in Geneva,  which entered into force at noon on Friday [10 June], has met  with unequal compliance. "We have encouraging reports from  certain regions, while in other areas the fronts have remained  active," a UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] spokesman stated.    "The German press describes us as `reasonable Serbs' and I  am  very pleased to hear it." Mirko Pejanovic is certainly a  courageous man: A Bosnian Serb but "a Bosnian above all," he  heads the Council of Serb Citizens of Bosnia-Herzegovina, a body  set up on 27 April in Sarajevo that opposes the partitioning of  the republic and wants to maintain a multiethnic Bosnia.  Denouncing the fact that the international community treats  Radovan Karadzic as the sole representative of the Bosnian  Serbs, he is on a three-day visit to Paris, after visiting a  number of European capitals, including Moscow.    "In the history of Bosnia, no war has succeeded in  destroying  tolerance and the ability to live together." A political  science professor at Sarajevo University and a member of the  Bosnian collegial presidency since June 1991, Mirko Pejanovic  claims to represent the 200,000 Serbs residing in areas  controlled by the Bosnian Army, the majority of them Muslims.  "You must also take into account the 400,000 Bosnian Serb  refugees who want to return," he pointed out. "In total, we  represent nearly as many Serbs as those living in Karadzic's  republic, who number almost 600,000, many of them wanting peace."    The Council of Serb Citizens supports the Croato-Bosnian  federation which is currently being organized, although it had  asked for the Constitution to include a clause stating that in  addition to the Croats and Muslims, the Serbs, who constitute a  national minority, were also one of the federation's founders. A  decision on this question has been postponed until later, to be  settled in the framework of a global settlement. "We do not  want to become second-class citizens within the federation,"  stated Pejanovic, "First of all there was Karadzic's war and  the secession; then in Sarajevo, we felt growing hostility  toward us. We refuse to become Palestinians within our own  country."    "Only Russia and France can exert pressure on the Serbs to  accept a political solution," he stresses. In Moscow, Pejanovic  claims to have "obtained the assurance that Russia is opposed to  the partitioning of Bosnia and against ethnic cleansing."  Pejanovic believes that any solution must include a federation  organized into cantons. In order to permit the return of 1  million refugees, there is also a need to set up "international  miniprotectorates in the gray (or contested) zones." These  areas are now controlled by Serb forces but had Croat and Muslim  majorities before the war.    Invited to the French National Assembly by the  France-Bosnia-Herzegovina friendship group, Pejanovic, who is  also to have talks at the Quai d'Orsay [Foreign Ministry], paid  homage to the initiators of the "Europe Begins at Sarajevo"  list: "Europe has slumbered throughout this war. This party is  an awakening of conscience. For the first time, moral  principles have been raised rather than concentrating primarily  on political imperatives."    Pejanovic shows little concern at being described as a  "traitor" by Karadzic and his henchmen: "If you are a traitor  because you reject ethnic cleansing, then I am happy to be  described as one."</p>

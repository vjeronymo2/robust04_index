			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky by </F> unidentified program announcer; place and date not given; from  the "Morning Dialogue" program -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [Announcer] From today it is possible to sign  the framework agreement of the so-called Partnership for Peace  in Brussels. It is believed in Brussels that the affected  countries are in quite a rush. Lithuania, for example, would  like to sign the document within days, and its prime minister  himself will go to Brussels to sign. Our guest is Foreign  Minister Geza Jeszenszky, who, according to reports last  weekend, will sign the accord personally. However, last weekend  there also appeared rather different assessments about the  accord. Increasingly more people believe that this agreement is  really a success for Russia and not for the Central European or,  if you like, the Visegrad Group of countries.    [Jeszenszky] I do not agree with the view which holds that  it  is not our success. Last October, when Warren Christopher  presented this program to Hungary and the world for the first  time, it was much more modest than the current one. It did not  contain -- or did only very hazily -- the promise of NATO  membership, whereas now the door is open. For Hungary, NATO  membership is not the only possible way of legally joining  Western structures but perhaps the fastest and safest one.  [passage omitted: benefits, chances of membership]    [Announcer] Has a concrete date been fixed for you to go  Brussels and sign the accord?    [Jeszenszky] This is not a horse race. I do not consider it  important as to who overtakes whom. In any case, Hungary --  which has played quite a significant role in working out the  draft -- will surely be among the first. I do not mind signing  simultaneously with others. [passage omitted] I do not know the  concrete date, but I think that the signing will take place  within a good couple of weeks.    [Announcer] You visit Belgrade this week. What will you take  with you, for, after all, Hungary's relations with Serbia, or to  be more precise, rump Yugoslavia are, to put it mildly, not very  good. [passage omitted]    [Jeszenszky] [passage omitted] For Hungary, the end of the  conflict is very important. [passage omitted] The Danube, as a  free waterway, is of vital importance, and then there are the  Hungarians in Vojvodina, who are under threat. Really, the aim  of this visit is to demonstrate again that our objective --  ever since the formation of this government -- is to carry out a  balanced policy toward all our neighbors, including the  Yugoslavs. [passage omitted]    [Announcer] Is there a thawing in the Belgrade-Budapest  relationship?    [Jeszenszky] I can say that the outbursts which could be  described as regular, have ceased -- quietened down -- in the  Belgrade press. These were the most impossible tales: That  there are training camps in Hungary; that Hungary, in  cooperation with Croatia, is arming the neighbors. [passage  omitted] These reports, which were manufactured for domestic  consumption, have now ceased.    It is also important that the most innocent victim of the  embargo, the civil population -- and even within this group,  those who have nothing to do with the policy which provoked the  embargo, such as the Vojvodina Hungarians, for example -- should  survive this period. [passage omitted on Hungarian humanitarian  aid deliveries]. The first task is to ensure the survival of,  and the second task is the achievement of the political  recognition of, the Vojvodina Hungarians. We have some hopes in  respect of the latter and I would like to investigate this.    [Announcer] What do you mean by political recognition?    [Jeszenszky] Recently, several contacts have taken place  between the Democratic Community of the Hungarians in Vojvodina  [VMDK] and the Serb leadership. I think that the VMDK does not  wish to make use of this difficult situation -- i.e., that the  Hungarians can tip the scales between the Serbian Socialist  Party and the enemy [ellenseg] -- either by entering the  government or to form a coalition with a very heterogenous  opposition which includes, inter alia, extremist radicals.  However, in any case, the VMDK's responsible behavior will  perhaps slowly achieve certain results and the political plans  of the Hungarian population -- the various autonomy concepts,  i.e., that it is a political factor [szubjektum] whose affairs  must be sorted out -- have a certain chance of succeeding.  [passage omitted]    [Announcer] Last week the Slovak Foreign Ministry attacked  you for saying in an interview in a Polish newspaper that there  is no border question between Hungary and Slovakia. [passage  omitted]    [Jeszenszky] I do not think that it was for this sentence  that I was attacked -- only very bigoted people could attack me  for it. However, what I said was very much in line with, e.g.,  the stand of the Hungarian grand assembly [nagygyueles], the  government assembly [kormanyzati assembly] in Komarno [Komarom],  too.    This attack is an artificial incitment to hysteria, or  serves  domestic political purposes. [passage omitted] The long  interview contained but a mere half-sentence reference to the  fact that certain of our neighbors, Slovakia and Romania, do not  fulfil the expectations of the Council of Europe, their own  promises. [Slovak] Foreign Minister Moravcik knows very well  that this is a fact. The fact that he comments in an elaborate  way on my statement shows precisely that Slovakia would like to  divert attention to what is taking place there.    [Announcer] In Hungary, several political forces are calling  for a referendum to be held regarding Partnership for Peace,  since it is such an important issue that it cannot be decided  without asking the people. What is your view on this?    [Jeszenszky] I believe no referendum is planned regarding  the  Partnership for Peace program in its narrow sense.  Parliamentary ratification will only become necessary if  Hungarian troops were sent abroad or foreigners took part in  Hungarian military exercises. If the agreement includes such  details then we will submit it to parliament. Consultation is  continuous with the parliamentary parties regarding these issues.    NATO membership is a different matter. [passage omitted]  NATO provides absolute security, since it represents a force  which can deter small and large aggressor from making an attack.  Therefore I believe that the closest possible relationship with  NATO is in Hungary's unequivocal interest. I do not believe  that a referendum is justified from this point of view. It is  also very expensive. [passage omitted]    I believe there will be no need for a referendum after the  forthcoming elections, but each party should state clearly  before the elections what their stand is regarding NATO. The  Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] advocates NATO membership, so  those who want NATO membership in Hungary should vote for the  MDF, and those who are afraid of NATO membership should vote for  other parties.</p>

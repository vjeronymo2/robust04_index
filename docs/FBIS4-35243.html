			<p>BFN     [Text] Amman--The General Secretary of Parliament Salih  al-Zu'bi has been relieved of his duties and appointed an  advisor at the Prime Ministry, informed sources told the JORDAN  TIMES Sunday.    The sources said the Cabinet decided to remove Dr. Zu'bi  from  his post during a session Saturday, but has not yet agreed on a  replacement for him.    Dr. al-Zu'bi who had earlier worked as an ambassador, took  up  his post at Parliament in 1990.    Sources said among the candidates to replace Dr. Zu'bi are  Helmi al-Sarabi, a legal advisor at the Prime Ministry and Hakam  Khayr, who is the official spokesman of al-Watan Party.    Mr. Khayr's affiliation with al-Watan, however, could weaken  his chances to land the job as it is preferred that the general  secretary of Parliament is an independent figure, the sources  said.    "We hope that the newcomer would be able to redress the  deterioration in support services provided to deputies by the  General Secretariat," one lawmaker told the JORDAN TIMES.    The deputy said there has been a noticeable regression in  the  quality of administrative services awarded to lawmakers, which  reflected on their ability to deal effectively with issues of  concern to the public.    Other parliamentary sources echoed the lawmaker in  expressing  dissatisfaction with the performance of the General Secretariat,  saying they hoped the change would bring about an improvement in  the services it is supposed to extend to lawmakers.</p>

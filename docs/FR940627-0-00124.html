			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As proposed in the NPRM, the grouping system allows similar fuels and additives to be grouped together, rather than creating separate fuel groups and additive groups. This convention recognizes that, to meet the requirements of this final rule, an additive must be mixed with its associated base fuel <FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>  prior to generating the emissions for testing. To the extent that the resulting additive/base fuel mixture is similar to existing fuel formulations, the tests conducted on the emissions of the additive/base fuel mixture will be duplicative of tests conducted on the related fuels. To avoid potential duplication, this final rule maintains the proposed approach, in which closely-related fuels and additives are grouped together. Accordingly, the manufacturers of fuels and the related additives can fulfill their individual registration responsibilities through jointly-supported testing rather than through duplicative independent efforts. By grouping similar fuels and additives together, the grouping scheme also avoids the need to define each generic product or product component as either a ``fuel'' or an ``additive.'' This would otherwise present a problem when a given substance (or mixture) can serve as either a fuel or an additive (e.g., ethanol).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 16 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Base fuel specifications for each fuel family are described in Section V. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the NPRM, EPA developed criteria for sorting individual F/FAs into groups of related formulations based on similarities in the chemical/physical properties of the ``raw'' fuel or additive/base fuel mixture. EPA has maintained this approach in the final rule. EPA expects F/FAs within each group to have similar emission characteristics and thus essentially the same general effects on the public health and welfare. Therefore, chemical or toxicologic information associated with individual members of a given group can reasonably be generalized to all F/FAs in the group. EPA will consider tests performed on a selected representative of a group to apply to all members of the group for purposes of compliance with registration requirements, for deciding whether to require additional testing under Tier 3, or for taking regulatory action under CAA section 211(c).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While each manufacturer of a fuel or fuel additive will still be held individually accountable for compliance with the registration program, the grouping system provides an opportunity for meeting the program requirements in a more cost-effective manner. Participation in the F/FA grouping system is strictly voluntary, and any manufacturer may choose to fulfill the requirements on an individual basis. Those who choose to take advantage of the grouping opportunity will be able to share their planning efforts, research capabilities, and financial resources to satisfy the information-gathering and testing requirements of the F/FA registration program. To satisfy the chemical and biological testing requirements, the required tests will be done on the selected representative for the respective group, rather than being repeated for each of the F/FAs in the group. The results of the tests on the group representative will then be submitted jointly for all members of the group, with applicable costs to be shared by the respective manufacturers (based on their cost-sharing agreements, as discussed in Section IV.C). Manufacturers who question whether the results obtained for their group's representative are valid for their own products may conduct confirmatory tests on their products on an independent basis and at their own cost. However, until such independent test results are made available to EPA, the original results submitted on behalf of the group will be considered valid for all member products, and could be applied by EPA to support regulatory decisions under CAA section 211(c) or requirements for further testing under CAA section 211(b).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The F/FA grouping system is expected to provide a number of benefits to the F/FA manufacturers who are responsible for registration while increasing the efficiency and functionality of the registration program itself. First, the grouping system will reduce the overall costs of the registration program by avoiding the generation and submission of essentially redundant information by individual manufacturers with similar products. In addition, by reducing the number of individual formulations that will be subject to testing, the grouping system is expected to ease the pressure and demands on limited laboratory capacity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Grouping Approach and Criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The basic conceptual framework for the grouping system is illustrated in Figure 3. First, each fuel or additive is sorted into one of six broad ``fuel families.'' F/FAs in each fuel family are then subdivided into three ``F/FA categories.'' The categories are further subdivided into ``F/FA groups''_the ``working'' units of the grouping system. It is among the members of the F/FA groups that cooperative evaluation and testing efforts can be pursued using designated group representatives. This grouping system is very similar to the approach that was proposed in the NPRM, with the exception that the original proposal has been simplified in today's rule by eliminating the separate concept of ``formulation class.'' EPA judged that the ``formulation class'' concept could be confusing, and was not necessary for the structure or implementation of the grouping system. The key parameters and relationships within this grouping framework are further explained in the following sections. A summary of the grouping system is provided in Table F94&hyph;7 (see &sect;79.56) of the accompanying regulatory text for this rule. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;P <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0101 clearpage -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG -->  <!-- PJG STAG 4725 -->  <IMPORT>  <!-- PJG importformat s,d590 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> E:GRAPHICSER27JN94.003 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  </IMPORT>  <!-- PJG /STAG -->  <!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;C <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0101 clearpage -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

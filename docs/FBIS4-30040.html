			<p>BFN     [Text] Wellington, June 21 (AFP) -- Foreign investors are  continuing to buy into New Zealand faster than locals are buying  assets overseas, government statistics showed Tuesday as the  country's net international investment position deteriorated for  the fifth year.    The statistics show that at the end of March 1993, the net  position was 54.3 billion New Zealand dollars (32.08 billion US  dollars) in deficit, 8.1 billion dollars worse than the previous  March and the fifth year of decline.    This flowed from a decrease of 1.4 billion dollars to 31.7  billion dollars in overseas assets held by New Zealand investors  and an increase of 6.7 billion dollars to 86 billion dollars in  foreign-held assets in New Zealand.    The 6.7 billion dollars increase in New Zealand's total  international liabilities stemmed from rises in both foreign  equity holdings in New Zealand companies and in borrowings  overseas.    Equity rose to 23.2 billion dollars at the end of March 1993  from 18.5 billion dollars a year earlier, mainly due to a 4.6  billion dollar increase in foreign direct investment involving  25 percent or more of the voting shares of a company.    New Zealand investment abroad amounted to 21.7 billion  dollars at March 31, 1993, compared with 24.8 billion dollars a  year earlier.    In contrast, foreign investment in New Zealand increased to  76 billion dollars from 71 billion dollars.</p>

			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Ethnic cleansing: the phrase means death: The tactics of terror used by the Serbians to get rid of unwanted peoples THIS WEEK, Serbian soldiers fired deliberately on UN helicopters carrying wounded Moslems from the eastern Bosnian town of Srebrenica. There has been nothing like this before, according to Elizabeth Baldwin, the spokeswoman for the UN operation. But the brutality was in keeping with the character of the war in Bosnia. It was an element of the larger attempt by the Serbs to drive Moslems from territory they want. In that revolting euphemism used to dignify expulsion and massacre, it was part of the process of ethnic cleansing. There is more than one way of achieving this end, though. If you visit what is left of Yugoslavia, Serbia itself and Montenegro, you can see the other means that can be used to get rid of unwanted peoples. You can kill them or you can make them so frightened that they leave, anyway. You can see all the conditions for cleansing in place in Pljevlja, a small town in Montenegro. The Moslems here have two insurmountable problems: they are in a minority of 40 per cent and the town is only a short drive away from Bosnia and the war. It is strange, talking to the men in the bars. They are too frightened to be seen with westerners on the street or in their homes. 'Even here, I am afraid,' admitted one. They were all ordinary men: a young science teacher, a tradesman who had come back from Germany just a few years before, a chemist shop-owner. Every so often, they would call over someone who had dropped in. 'We were normal before,' said the shopkeeper. 'Now, we talk about nothing but politics.' It is precisely their ordinariness that makes you believe them. They are prosaic men, constitutionally indisposed to hyperbole. 'After the war in Bosnia started, all at once relations between Serbs and Moslems became cold,' said one man. 'Since then, the Serbs have been training with weapons. Not just Serbs from outside - the town is full of Serbs from Bosnia - but from here, too. They have the idea of Greater Serbia. Last year, many Moslems were sent away. There were fire bombs, over 40 attacks on Moslem businesses.' I had heard about this already: a paramilitary called Ceko Dasevic was responsible and had been imprisoned a month ago - because, it was rumoured, he had fallen out with the federal army commanders. But the psychosis the bombings brought about still exists. One man had two perfume shops that were attacked. 'Everything was burned; I don't have the money to start again,' he said. 'I have a wife and two children, but I don't work. I've got to go - my life is in danger. If they do that to my business, tomorrow they will do it to my house.' Another said: 'I'm a businessman, and for a year I have not been able to work. For 80 per cent of Moslems, it's like that. It's a psychic condition, a sickness here. I never thought I would be without work. I'm at home all day. After eight o'clock, I can't go out. This is a land without law.' The children put up with a different type of pressure. 'My son is in a class of 30 children,' said the grocer. 'Ten of them are Moslems. The other day, he came home to say that the teacher had written all their names on the board, then crossed them out and written Serbian names beside. My son is called Riza; the teacher wrote 'Sergen' beside his name.' But the most concretely ominous development has been the arming of the Serbs. (Most Moslems, incidentally, insist that their problems are with Serbs rather than ethnic Montenegrins.) 'The Serbs all have weapons and they can do what they like,' said one man. 'Recently, I was walking with some friends and I heard shots in the forest. They were training. On Mondays and Fridays, on market day, there's most to see here. People come down from the villages with automatics, in Chetnik uniform. We are closed in here. The villages on the mountains are all Serb. We have no choice here. We know exactly how it will happen.' 'It'll be like everywhere else, from Slovenia to Bosnia,' said his friend. 'Serbian propaganda says the Moslems have many weapons. We've got weapons? Where from - tell me that? Pistols, maybe, but nothing more. But they will come into town from the hills and say 'Moslems will have to give up their weapons.' We won't be able to, because we haven't got any. Then they'll say, 'the Moslems have not given up their arms,' and the bombardment will start.' Another man joined us. He was quiet and undemonstrative, with deep lines down his face. His town of Bisegrad in Bosnia had been 'cleansed.' He could not talk about it properly because he was unable to concentrate for long on those terrible events. The federal army had occupied Bisegrad for a month. On leaving, it turned over all its arms to the paramilitaries - the White Eagles and Arkan's Tigers. The man hid with others in his cellar. The paramilitaries came, calling for Moslems by name. He saw many things: the women and girls taken to a hall in the town to be raped; and four men ordered to stand on the town's bridge, then shot, one by one, with pistols. He had escaped to here, where relatives had taken him in. He shrugged when I asked him what he thought about Pljevlja. 'It's exactly the same as where I've come from,' he said. After Pljevlja, I returned to neighbouring Kosovo. Here, in the capital of Prishtine, you can still see election posters from last December. Zeljko Raznjatovic - better known as 'Commander Arkan,' paramilitary leader and war criminal - is now the Serbs' elected representative. His poster is on the walls and inside a few shops: dandling a blond-haired little boy on his knee, or dapper in military dress. In this region, which used to be autonomous, there are nearly 2m Albanians: Serbs make up about 7 per cent of the population. In 1989, Slobodan Milosevic came here and promised Serbs that Kosovo would always be Serbian. After that, Kosovo's autonomy was taken away. When Albanian workers went on strike to protest, 105,000 were sacked - everyone in state employment, from road sweepers to magistrates. The Albanian curriculum in schools and university was prohibited; Albanian education was driven underground. At the same time, the police arrived in force from Serbia - to protect, they said, the Serbs from Albanian aggression. Unemployment and police problems might seem to pale besides the threat of being killed. But the effect - to make people leave, and want to leave - is the same. It is in small ways that you notice the increasing demoralisation of the Albanians. If you walk home at midnight - after the informal curfew - in Prishtine with an Albanian, you have to tread carefully. You advance slowly towards a crossing, then glance down the street, searching for the silhouette of armed police. If the street is clear, you walk ahead rapidly. Actually, I stayed a few paces behind my companion. When it was safe, I was beckoned forward. It was not a game - when I last visited the Grand Hotel here two months ago, an Albanian was shot dead outside the JNA barracks next door just a couple of hours afterwards. 'You don't understand what it's like,' my companion said, afterwards. 'The police here aren't normal. All they want to know is whether you're Serb or Albanian. If you are an Albanian, they beat you.' Unemployment, harassment, poverty: the result of the campaign against the Albanians is predictable. Shortly after I arrived, I met a man who was going to Turkey the next day with his wife and baby daughter. 'I do not want to go,' he said, 'but there is no future here.' It does not sound like ethnic cleansing. But it amounts to the same thing.</p>

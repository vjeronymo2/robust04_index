			<p><P> December 6, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> VIRGINIA;  </P> <P> LAB WORKERS TEST NEGATIVE FOR VIRUS  </P> <P> Hazleton Research Products, a Reston, Va., research laboratory where monkeys  were found to be infected with a rare and deadly virus, said that precautionary  testing found all of its employees to be free of the disease. The company sent  workers' blood samples to the national Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta  for analysis after one man who handled monkeys infected with the Ebola virus  became ill and was placed in isolation at Fairfax Hospital. The disease, which  has an incubation period of two to 21 days, causes internal and external  bleeding and organ failure and has a 50% to 90% mortality rate.  </P></p>

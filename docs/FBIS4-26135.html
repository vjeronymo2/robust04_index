			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Evening Talk" column by Yang Chu (5017 2612): "United </F> States Releases Sanctions Plan"]    [Text] The United States has announced a proposal for  three-phase sanctions against the DPRK, with the first phase of  the sanctions being an arms embargo, which will ban the sale of  all weapons and components to the DPRK.    The sanctions also include such steps as a halt to economic  and technical assistance to the DPRK and a halt to the $15  million in annual aid offered by the UN to the DPRK. Technical  assistance to be stopped includes that for a program on the  peaceful utilization of nuclear energy. In addition, diplomatic  exchanges, as well as cultural, technical, scientific,  commercial, and educational exchanges, with the DPRK will be  reduced, and air transportation to the DPRK will also be stopped.    The sanctions proposal was submitted to the UN Security  Council yesterday. The proposed sanctions seem rather mild,  because Chapter 7 of the UN Charter on the use of force by  states to execute a UN resolution was not applied in this case.    First, if force is not used to ensure the enforcement of the  UN resolution, then arms can still be shipped freely to the DPRK.    Second, as the sanctions bill will be put to the vote in the  UN Security Council, China, as a permanent member of the  Security Council, may exercise its veto as it has explicitly  expressed its opposition to the sanctions.    The United States may say that if the proposals are not  adopted by the Security Council, the United States and its  allies will continue to unilaterally impose the sanctions  against DPRK, but the sanctions will become less effective.    Third, former U.S. President Jimmy Carter is now visiting  Pyongyang, the capital of the DPRK, and he advocates that the  United States and the DPRK should establish full-scale  diplomatic relations.    The U.S. strategy is to combine threats with inducements in  order to compel the DPRK to submit. The United States seems  tough on the surface, but, fortunately, its real intention is to  seek a peaceful solution. The announcement of the sanctions  proposal appears to aggravate the tension, but the real  situation is not that tense.</p>

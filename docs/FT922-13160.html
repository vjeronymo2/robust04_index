			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / Technology: Coming soon to a screen near you - Steven Butler explains how the old-fashioned picture tube is fighting for life against liquid crystal displays One of the great inventions of the 20th century, the cathode ray tube (CRT), is heading towards obsolescence. The challenger in the vast and constantly growing market for television and computer screens is liquid crystal. The quality of liquid crystal display (LCD) screens - which are thin, flat and portable - has leapt forward in recent years. Sharp, the Japanese electronics company, sold the world's first calculators with LCD screens in 1973. After nearly two decades of research and development, however, LCD panels on personal computers are still seen as a poor substitute for the CRT. Yet this view is quickly becoming outdated. Sharp is now marketing 8.6-inch colour televisions in Japan with brilliant colours and fast response. NEC last year began marketing portable computers with full-colour LCD screens using the most sophisticated thin film transistor (TFT) technology, in which contrast and response time are boosted by adding a transistor to each display cell or pixel. IBM recently announced a similar product. While brightness and the restricted viewing angle on LCD screens need to be improved, the quality of these screens will gradually change the popular perception that LCD is a second-rate technology. Even more important, manufacturing yields on high-end products for this extremely difficult device are beginning to approach respectability, raising the prospect of a classic virtuous circle in new product technology. As yields rise, manufacturing costs and prices are dropping rapidly. This in turn is stimulating growth in the market, which again encourages more investment, improved technology and lower prices still. Japanese companies, the only significant producers, are talking about a quadrupling of the market in a few years, compared with 1991 production of Y255bn. Last year production grew by 40 per cent, compared with 33 per cent average growth in the past five years. LCD screens have become one of the few bright spots in an otherwise dull outlook for the electronics industry. Few people, other than television picture tube manufacturers, will mourn the decline of the CRT. Anyone who has gone home bleary-eyed after spending the day staring into the flickering display of a personal computer knows why it needs to go. The flickering may be faster than the eye can perceive, but it still causes fatigue. The latest LCD screens, by contrast, display a solid, sharp image that holds steady. Worries about electromagnetic radiation fields surrounding the CRT, and its effect on pregnant women, will also hasten its demise for many uses. CRTs are bulky, heavy, use lots of electricity and cannot be made perfectly flat, unlike LCD panels. Yet in spite of its drawbacks, the CRT will not be easy to replace because the technology is so well established. In the past year electronics giants such as Sharp, Matsushita, NEC, Canon, and Toshiba and IBM (in a joint venture) have joined a race to meet growing demand by committing hundreds of millions of dollars to manufacture colour LCD screens. Liquid crystals, which display properties of both solids and liquids, were first discovered in 1888, but it was not until 1963 that scientists at RCA, the US electronics group, discovered the principle that lies behind all LCD displays: that an electrical charge causes liquid crystal molecules to realign and rechannel light waves. In simple LCD devices, known as twisted nematic (TN), liquid crystal molecules are held in a double sandwich of polarising filters and glass plates. The filters sit on the outside of the sandwich and are turned at 90 degrees, which blocks light passing straight through the glass. The liquid crystal, however, is also aligned at 90 degrees by grooves in the glass. This causes the light to twist and the filters to be neutralised. But when electricity is applied to the liquid crystal, the molecules straighten and the light is again blocked by the filter. The end result is that display cells can be made to lighten or darken as their opaqueness is switched off or on by electricity. Unfortunately, however, when a display is increased in size the contrast between dark and light areas of the screen tends to decline. To compensate for this, LCD makers have sought to increase the twisting effect and thereby heighten contrast as light is refracted. In 'super twisted' nematic displays (STN) light is twisted by between 180 and 260 degrees, producing the blue screens familiar to portable and laptop computer users. In 'double super twisted' nematic (DSTN) displays, two STN cells are used, twisting the light one direction and then back, so that light of high contrast is possible. In a final variation of this theme, 'triple super twisted' nematic (TSTN), refracting polymer film is applied to the STN cell, allowing thinner displays with a high degree of contrast, thus permitting colour display when red-blue-green filters are attached to the cells. These elaborations on the simple LCD mechanism, however, have a range of shortcomings. While the TN contrast ratio of 1:6 is increased to 1:20 for TSTN, this is still insufficient to reproduce the entire range of colours familiar in a colour picture tube. Furthermore, response times of 150 milliseconds are insufficient to keep up with moving video images, and cannot track a mouse moving across a screen. In answer to these shortcomings, the industry is moving in two directions. Most companies are improving displays by adding a tiny transistor to each cell in order to increase the charging power. This technology, called thin film transistor, boasts a contrast ratio of 1:100, allowing for full-colour displays and response times fast enough for video display. The result, however, is a device of staggering complexity, including at least 10 layers of materials, finely etched circuitry, and transistors that are shorted out by a microscopic speck of dust. Canon, the camera and office equipment company, is moving in a different direction, using a proprietary technology that is likely to grab a big section of the market for engineering workstations and desktop publishing. Canon's 'ferroelectric' displays use a liquid crystal material which responds more quickly to electrical charges. The molecules are more difficult to align and control than normal liquid crystal chemicals, yet after solving these problems Canon has developed a screen that has higher contrast and faster response times than other simple matrix systems. The screen also promises to be much cheaper to mass produce than TFT screens because no transistors are required. The relative sensitivity to shock of ferroelectric displays makes them unsuitable for portable computers, however, and the response time is insufficient for video. Colour reproduction is also inferior to TFT, although photographs can be displayed with sufficient fidelity to allow easy computer editing. Yet the remarkable high quality and stability of the display - looking almost like printed paper behind glass - could make it the biggest threat yet to the CRT in offices. Indeed, when Canon finishes a new manufacturing facility in 1994, it will enter the market at the high end, with 15-inch screens which it hopes eventually to sell at a price similar to that of the CRT. The CRT looks likely to prevail for TV picture tubes larger than 15 or so inches. This is because large LCD screens are still too difficult to make. But beyond 36 inches LCD once again comes into its own as the core of video projection devices, including high-definition television. Yet the technology for LCD has been evolving so rapidly that it is difficult to project how the market will develop. Research into a range of radically different approaches to flat panel displays is also continuing apace. The inherent complexity of LCD manufacture, has raised fears that it could be made obsolete quickly by a simpler technology. The investment by electronics companies into LCD manufacturing facilities is an impressive sign that the technology has come of age. This commitment by the industry itself should help the market to become established quickly. A further article on LCD technology, addressing the manufacturing challenges, will appear on Thursday.</p>

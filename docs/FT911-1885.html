			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Accountancy Column: Secrecy and success in schizophrenic institute IMAGINE THAT you are a bright young partner in one of the UK's top 20 accountancy practices. Like all young partners, you are eager to promote your career. But, unlike the majority of this breed, you take a lively interest in professional affairs. You have impassioned views on the Caparo decision, you are fascinated by the politics of accounting standards, you are proud of your profession. But would you like to reach the pinnacle of the profession and become president of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales? Even if you would like to achieve this honour, would you know how to go about it? The answer is probably no, for even ageing senior partners who have decades of experience of the institute and its arcane ways have little idea of how the president is elected. The Accountancy Column can reveal exclusively that the president is elected by the meeting of the institute's council members every June. There are more than 80 of these distinguished personages, who collectively take responsibility for running the institute. At the end of the June meeting, one of them will be chosen for the presidency three years in the future, because elections are held three years in advance. This is not as simple as it seems. Even though council members vote for the next president but two, they have no choice in the matter. There has never, in the 111-year history of the institute, been more than one candidate for this eminent position. In short, the election is predetermined. The real election takes place several months before at a meeting - or a series of meetings - of the so-called president's advisory committee. This is the most secret of all the ICAEW's myriad committees  - so secret that it goes under different names according to the different functions it fulfils. On occasions this committee is known as the committee review subcommittee. Under this name it decides who shall chair and take the main positions on the institute's policy-making committees - the parliamentary and law committee and the business law committee, as well as the district societies standing conference and the financial and auditing committee. As the president's advisory committee, it is responsible for producing a candidate for the presidency. Under normal circumstances, the membership consists of this year's president, the deputy and the vice-president (presidents for next year and the year after), and the institute's last six presidents. When in its committee review sub-committee capacity, three, not six, past-presidents attend, plus one other council member. The veil cannot be lifted any further. It is not known what are the concerns of the past presidents and the present president, and the next two presidents to come, when they produce a name for the presidential candidate. To its credit, the ICAEW has itself recognised the limitations of the methods by which presidents are elected. Under Mr Arthur Green, a former president and therefore a member of the most secret committee, a working party has undertaken an extensive review of the ICAEW's constitutional arrangements. The report, published last month, recommends that the council be replaced with an enlarged representative assembly and a slimmed-down executive board. The board, which would take over many of the functions of the current council, would also be responsible for electing the president. The president's advisory committee would be replaced with a nominating committee, the job of which would be to nominate candidates. Any person getting the support of more than 10 per cent of the 150-person representative committee would have to be among the nominees going forward to the board for election. This constitutional review is the latest example of head-scratching going on at Moorgate Place. Highly successful though the 111-year old institute may be, it is in some ways an institution looking for a role. The ICAEW's success is demonstrable. It has 87,000 active members - half of whom work in industry and the other half in professional practice - giving it unrivalled sway over British commercial life. Every year a queue of thousands of the UK's cleverest graduates embarks on the arduous training which ultimately leads to membership of the institute. But the ICAEW is today suffering the consequences of its success. Its membership is vast and heterogeneous. Sole practitioners, partners in Big Six firms and finance directors of public companies, have little in common except their member-ship of the institute and shared memories of the rigours of the training contract. The institute fulfils a number of different and not necessarily consistent roles. It is a training body committed to maintaining excellence in new entrants into the profession; a trade association, lobbying for the interests of its members; and a disciplinary body, concerned to preserve the highest professional standards among its members. Increasingly, under first the Insolvency Act 1986 and the Financial Services Act of the same year, and now the Companies Act 1989, it is a regulator as well. To the dispassionate observer, it is not clear that all these aims and objectives are consistent with one another. The greatest conflict is between its role as trade association and its new function as regulator. Acting in what it then perceived to be the best interests of British accountants, the institute originally lobbied against the requirement for auditors to be monitored under the Companies Act 1989. It lost the argument  -and is now fighting to be approved by the government as the body responsible for doing the monitoring. The ICAEW believes that its new regulatory responsibilities take precedence over its trade-association functions, and in this it is undoubtedly sincere. But the more vigorously it monitors its member firms, the more it risks alienating them. There is already one senior partner of a Big Six firm who privately says he is so disillusioned with the institute that he would rather the monitoring be taken over by a government agency like the Securities and Exchange Commission in the US. After more than a century of self-regulation, this is a heretical position to take, even in private. Perhaps this is a tribute to the vigilance with which the ICAEW is carrying out its new duties. But it is also a warning: to command respect of the profession, the ICAEW must not get lost in internal politics. The abolition of the president's advisory committee would be a good first step.</p>

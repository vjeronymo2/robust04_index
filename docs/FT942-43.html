			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (South Africa): Johannesburg unable to make fresh headway South African shares slipped further, ignoring the stronger showing in Europe and Wall Street's firmer opening. Trading was very quiet, with the market still nervous that inflationary fears could lead to higher foreign interest rates. The overall index fell 66 to 5,421 as industrial shares traded lower and a softer bullion price took gold shares down. Industrials finished 77 off at 6,281 and golds slipped 16 to 2,068. Among key issues, De Beers, the diamond producer, retreated R2 to R107.50 in spite of the release of first-half sales figures from its Central Selling Organisation which were only slightly below expectations. CSO sales were up 1.5 per cent to Dollars 2.58bn in the first six months. Anglo American, the mining conglomerate, weakened R4.25 to R226, but Barlows, the heavy engineering group, was unchanged at R34. South African Breweries fell R4 to R85.</p>

			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Pharmaceuticals division behind growth at Zeneca MR DAVID BARNES, Zeneca's chief executive, yesterday said his greatest priority was to drive the pharmaceuticals division as hard as he could, writes Paul Abrahams. The division, the company's largest and most profitable, gave all the signs of being successfully driven yesterday. Most surprising was the increase in sales of Zestril, the ace-inhibitor used to treat heart disease, which rose 64 per cent from Pounds 127m to Pounds 208m. Underlying growth, excluding exchange rates, was an impressive 44 per cent, although prices fell 1 per cent. Mr John Mayo, finance director, said Zestril had benefited from the switching of much of the US sales force from Tenormin, where patents have expired. However, the benefits of Zeneca's recent emphasis on the managed care market in the US - the company now has about 40 key account managers dedicated to the sector - had also helped. It had been able to differentiate the once a day Zestril treatment from other drugs in the over-crowded ace-inhibitor market. Zeneca's position in the hospital market appeared to be paying dividends. Sales of Zoladex, a cancer treatment, rose 43 per cent from Pounds 49m to Pounds 70m. Underlying sales increased 31 per cent, though prices fell 2 per cent. Nolvadex, another cancer treatment, generated sales up 49 per cent to Pounds 175m. Growth, excluding exchange rates, was a creditable 26 per cent. Diprivan, an anaesthetic, generated sales up 42 per cent from Pounds 67m to Pounds 95m. Underlying growth was 25 per cent, including a 5 per cent sales increase. Healthcare reforms hit Zeneca's sales in Germany where they dropped 4 per cent, from Pounds 49m to Pounds 47m. The combined fall in volumes and prices was 18 per cent, compared with 21 per cent for the whole market. The agrochemical division increased its sales of herbicides by 15 per cent from Pounds 366m to Pounds 421m, although volume growth was only 1 per cent. Insecticides turnover was up 12 per cent from Pounds 138m to Pounds 155m, although volumes were static. Fungicide sales fell 2 per cent, from Pounds 91m to Pounds 89m, while underlying volumes fell 11 per cent. Sales of seeds increased 11 per cent to Pounds 99m, although volumes were down 3 per cent. Although the specialities division raised sales by 8 per cent to Pounds 519m, underlying growth was static. The textile colours and dyestuffs sector suffered most from the recession. Sales of biological products, such as Quorn, increased 9 per cent, from Pounds 11m to Pounds 12m.</p>

			<p><P> July 7, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> WASHINGTON, D.C.;  </P> <P> REPORT SAYS NASA REJECTED HUBBLE TEST  </P> <P> NASA officials, awaiting results of an investigation into the mirror flaws  plaguing the Hubble Space Telescope, refused to comment on a report the space  agency passed up chances to test the mirrors on the ground. Sources quoted in  Aviation Week and Space Technology's July 9 issue said the Air Force offered  NASA use of its spy satellite test facilities to check the $1.5-billion space  telescope's two main mirrors 10 years ago. But NASA turned down the offer  because the Air Force wanted all NASA and private industry personnel associated  with the tests to obtain top secret military clearance, the sources said.  </P></p>

			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / Burma's main rebel group to seek peace: Why the Karen are under pressure to stop fighting The largest remaining guerrilla group in Burma has decided to hold separate peace talks with the government in response to mounting pressure from its traditional backer, Thailand, and a sharp build-up in Burmese armed forces. The ethnically based Karen National Union (KNU) will tell its colleagues in the anti-government Democratic Alliance of Burma (DAB) of its intention to hold talks with the government at a crisis meeting today in the Karen's jungle headquarters in Manerplaw. Up until now the Karen has insisted it will only talk to the Rangoon regime as part of a comprehensive political settlement with the DAB - an umbrella organisation of students, exiles and ethnic minorities which the KNU has traditionally dominated. But Dr Em Marta, head of the KNU's foreign affairs department, said in Manerplaw: 'We're in a very tight spot. I don't think any one party on its own could resist the pressure to negotiate.' The president of the KNU, and its military leader, General Bo Mya, said that if the KNU refused to go into the negotiating room alone warfare was likely to break out with renewed vigour, with more than 30 Burmese battalions in place around Manerplaw. 'We want peace but Slorc (State Law and Order Restoration Council) is preparing for war. Every day they are preparing positions around us. I think if we do not play their game then they will start the offensive,' said Gen Bo Mya. A Karen peace move would be a victory for the government's policy of picking off its opponents one by one with separate ceasefire deals: a process which began in 1989 with the collapse of the Burmese Communist party. When China closed the border, the communist remnant was forced to ask Rangoon for food and medicine in exchange for a peace agreement. Late in 1993 the Kachin Independence Army, Burma's biggest guerrilla group, was also forced into a ceasefire, under pressure from China, to the bitter disappointment of the Karen. The Burmese army has doubled in size in recent years, receiving over Dollars 1bn-worth of arms from China, and is now preparing to swing its full force against the Karen's estimated 6,000 soldiers (the Karen themselves claim 20,000, including part-timers). Apart from the Karen only a few Mon and Karreni guerrillas and students-turned-fighters remain actively hostile to Rangoon. The Karen have fought the Rangoon authorities since Burma won independence from Britain in 1948 and a commitment to allow minorities to decide their own political future was discarded. They support a federal state, rather than rule from Rangoon, which has historically only sporadically extended beyond the central plain. The Karen now live along the eastern border near Thailand. Thailand has traditionally welcomed the KNU's resistance to the Burmese government, seeing the group as providing a buffer zone between itself and the unstable and occasionally expansionist Burmese government. But times have changed. And the market imperative of restoring normal relations with its neighbour, as well as Asean's policy of constructive engagement has seen Thailand withdraw its backing for the KNU in recent months. Thailand, like China, is now eager to do business with the widely-reviled regime, which has been condemned by the United Nations for murdering many of its civilian population and for ignoring a 1990 general election which saw overwhelming support for a democratic opposition party. The Thai's are also worried that if fighting escalates thousands more civilians could pour over the border to join more than 70,000 refugees from Burma. This shift in position has seen an end to not only Thailand's own provision of weapons and ammunition, but also the end of its blind eye to the involvement of Thai brokers in the buying and selling of arms between Cambodia and the KNU. The insurgency would quickly collapse if ammunition supplies were cut off. To drive the point home Thailand has refused to allow key members of Burma's Manerplaw-based government-in-exile, including the prime minister, Mr Sein Win, to pass through Thai territory after a visit to Washington. Few of the regime's critics believe the current ceasefires will lead to lasting peace. The government is taking the opportunity to put a new constitution in place, to be nominally agreed by a convention of hand-picked delegates which has met sporadically for the last year. It is expected to formalise the role of the military in government.</p>

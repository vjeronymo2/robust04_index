			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 11 KYODO -- Yuichi Ichikawa, secretary  general of the Soka Gakkai-backed Komeito, called on the Social  Democratic Party (SDP) [SDPJ -- of Social Democratic Party of  Japan] Saturday [11 June] to return to the ruling coalition to  help stabilize Japanese politics.    In a speech to senior officials of Komeito's prefectural  chapters from across the country, Ichikawa rejected calls within  the SDP for prime minister Tsutomu Hata's cabinet to voluntarily  quit.    But Ichikawa praised the second largest opposition party for  exploring the possibility of its returning to the coalition,  which it bolted in April over the abrupt formation of "Kaishin  (Innovation)" by other coalition partners, including Hata's  Shinseito, Komeito and the Democratic Socialist Party.    The Komeito official criticized the Liberal Democratic Party  for hinting at introducing a no-confidence motion against the  Hata administration and cautioned the SDP against going along  with the LDP on the matter.</p>

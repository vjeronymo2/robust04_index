			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (4) Computation of the weekly and maximum amounts of basic TRA do not change under the 1988 Amendments in the OTCA. They must continue to be based upon the first benefit period which is related to the worker's first total or partial separation under the same certification regardless of whether such first separation occurs before, on, or after August 23, 1988. Upon the occurrence of a second or subsequent separation under the same certification which is a total qualifying separation under this part 617, the individual's eligibility period will be 104 weeks after the week of such second or subsequent (total qualifying) separation, but no change will be made in the weekly or maximum amounts of basic TRA as computed in relation to the first separation. Therefore, for any decision (i.e., determination, redetermination, or decision on appeal) issued on or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> after August 23, 1988, whenever an individual files a new TRA claim it will be necessary to determine whether the individual's most recent separation was a total qualifying separation, and, if so, whether the individual had a prior partial or total separation within the certification period of the same certification which was a first qualifying separation. If such most recent (total qualifying) separation occurred before August 23, 1988, and was not the individual's first qualifying separation, then: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The eligibility period will be the 104 weeks beginning with the week following the week in which the most recent total qualifying separation occurred  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> or <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  104 weeks after the first exhaustion of regular UI following the first qualifying separation, whichever is longer, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The individual's weekly amount of basic TRA, as computed under &sect;617.13, and the individual's maximum amount of basic TRA, as computed under &sect;617.14, are established or remain fixed as determined with respect to the individual's first benefit period following the first separation which is within the certification period of the certification covering the individual.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Eligibility period for additional TRA.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One technical and one conforming change are made by the OTCA in section 233(a)(3) of the Act, but have no effect on the 26-week eligibility period for additional TRA as the statute has been interpreted and applied in the past. Therefore, the 26-week eligibility period begins with the first week of training if the training begins after exhaustion of basic TRA. Further, if the training begins before approval is obtained under this part 617, the 26-week eligibility period begins with the week in which the determination of approval is issued, if there is any scheduled training session in that week after the date of the determination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Eligibility for TRA during breaks in training.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Paragraph (f) of section 233 of the Act, added by the OTCA, provides for the payment, under specified conditions, of both basic and additional TRA during scheduled breaks in a training program, provided the conditions for such payments are met as expressed in this part 617. By making this provision applicable to basic TRA as well as additional TRA, paragraph (f) of section 233 of the Act changes the prior law for both. Previously, basic TRA was payable during training breaks, but additional TRA was payable solely with respect to weeks of training. Under new section 233(f), both basic and additional TRA are payable during training breaks, but only if the break does not exceed 14 days. Now, as under the prior law, weeks when TRA is not payable will still count against the eligibility periods for both basic and additional TRA, and in the case of additional TRA it will also count against the number of weeks payable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Paragraph (f) of section 233 of the Act is effective with regard to all decisions (i.e., all determinations, redeterminations, and decisions on appeals) made on or after August 23, 1988, regardless of when the training was approved under section 236 of the Trade Act, or whether the training was approved or is approvable under section 236 as amended by the 1988 Amendments, or when the break in training began or ended. In making any decision involving paragraph (f) of section 233 of the Act, the law to be applied is the law as in effect on the date the decision is made.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Retroactive eligibility for TRA.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Effective on August 23, 1988, section 1425(b) of the OTCA provides for an open-ended waiver of the time limit in section 233(a)(2) on the eligibility period for basic TRA, and the 210-day time limit in section 233(b) on filing a bona fide application for training in order to qualify for additional TRA. This waiver provision applies solely to workers who experienced a total qualifying separation in the period which began on August 13, 1981 and ended on April 7, 1986. Other conditions must be met that are specified in section 1425(b) and in this part 617.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Altogether, nine conditions must be met for workers to obtain TRA payments under this special provision. (See &sect;617.11(a)(3).) Further, this special provision applies solely to weeks which begin after August 23, 1988; no retroactive payments may be made under this special provision. Finally, only the two specific time limitations are waived, and all other requirements of the prior and amended law apply, including the first separation rule (relating to computation of the weekly and maximum amounts of basic TRA payable), the 26-week eligibility period for additional TRA, and the break provision of section 233(f).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Training for adversely affected workers.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Extensive amendments to section 236 are made in the OTCA which, except for some technical and conforming changes that take effect on November 21, 1988, all became effective on August 23, 1988. These changes must be effectuated in accordance with this part 617.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (j)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Agreements with States.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 239 also was amended by the OTCA, to require new terms and conditions in the section 239 agreements. This requires new agreements to be executed between the States and the Secretary of Labor, and gives new emphasis to the contractual nature of the obligations entered into by the States to administer the TAA Program in strict accordance with the Act and the regulations and operating instructions issued by the Department.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

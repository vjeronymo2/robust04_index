			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since the enactment of the 1990 Act, the character of the lime industry has significantly changed. As a result of the extensive damage to lime orchards in Florida by Hurricane Andrew in August 1992, domestic production has plummeted and the volume of imports has increased dramatically. Domestic production is not expected to reach pre-Hurricane Andrew levels for possibly two to three years because Florida accounted for a majority of domestic production.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Shipment reports of domestic limes, from January 1, 1993, through December 31, 1993, indicate truck shipments of 8.71 million pounds from Florida and 8.24 million pounds from California, for a total of 16.95 million pounds. In contrast, shipment reports of imported limes for this period indicate truck shipments of 248.22 million pounds from Mexico plus an additional 8.78 million pounds from 12 other countries. Imports currently represent roughly 93 percent of lime shipments in the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Order currently requires lime producers, producer-handlers, and importers who produce or import 35,000 pounds or more annually for fresh market to pay an assessment not to exceed one cent per pound of limes. This proposal would limit assessment obligations to producers, producer-handlers, and importers of 200,000 pounds or more annually. The expected results of this amendment would significantly decrease the number of persons subject to the Order and decrease the amount of assessments collected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposal would also alter the size and composition of the Board, the administrative body appointed by the Secretary to operate the Order, from 11 members to seven. Further, this proposal would reduce the number of producer members serving on the Board from seven to three. The number of importer members would remain at three. The seventh member would be the public member. These changes to the Board's size and membership are reflective of the current structure of the lime industry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that the changes reflected in this action would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Paperwork Reduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. chapter 35) the information collection requirements contained in the Order have been approved by the OMB and were assigned OMB number 0581&hyph;0093, except for the Board nominee background statement form which was assigned OMB number  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 0505&hyph;0001. This action would generally reduce the number of information collections, and hence the reporting burden. The information collection requirements of the Order are as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> A periodic report by each first handler who handles limes for fresh market.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> When the amended Order is implemented, the estimated number of respondents required to complete this report would be 25, each submitting a maximum of 12 responses per year, with an estimated average reporting burden of 30 minutes per response. The change in exemption level, from less than 35,000 pounds to less than 200,000 pounds, should not affect the number of first handlers. However, this change could reduce their reporting burden because less information may be required from persons who previously would not be exempt from the Order. First handlers may alternatively prepay assessments annually, requiring only an initial report of anticipated assessments and a final annual report of actual handling;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> A periodic report by each importer who imports 200,000 or more pounds annually for fresh market.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The estimated number of respondents completing this report would be 35, each submitting a maximum of 12 responses per year, with an estimated average reporting burden of 15 minutes per response. The change in character of the lime industry due to increased imports since 1992 would raise the number of respondents filing this report from 5 to 35;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> A refund application form for persons who desire a refund of their assessments.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The estimated number of respondents completing this application would be five, each submitting two responses per year, with an estimated average reporting burden of 15 minutes per response. The change in exemption level would reduce the number of respondents filing this application from 200 to 5;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> An importer reimbursement application for persons who import less than 200,000 pounds annually and desire to be reimbursed for assessments collected by the U.S. Customs Service.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The estimated number of respondents completing this application would be 20, each submitting one response per year, with an estimated average reporting burden of 15 minutes per response. Because this is a new form, no comparative data regarding an increase or decrease in reporting burden is available;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

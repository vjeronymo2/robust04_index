			<p>BFN     [Text] South African President Nelson Mandela has pledged  to lend a hand in regional peace-making and development in  southern Africa. These two areas are expected to be the new  focus of the group of Frontline States formed to combat  apartheid. Speaking on the first day of the Frontline States'  summit in Harare, President Mandela said South Africa will play  a crucial role in resolving the problems facing southern Africa.  In the same vein, he said, the Frontline states were still  necessary to help establish democracy in South Africa.    At today's meeting the Frontline states are expected to form  a new structure which will concentrate on other regional  problems in conjunction with the Southern African Development  Community.    When asked about the Rwanda situation, Mr. Mandela said  South  Africa had already agreed to provide a field hospital and was  now considering leasing 50 armored personnel carriers to the UN  for its risky operations.    [Johannesburg Radio South Africa Network in English 0500 GMT  on 4 June 94 adds the following: "President Nelson Mandela has  returned from his first official visit to a foreign country.  President Mandela, who attended a meeting of the Frontline  States in Harare, lauded the Frontline States for their role in  the dismantling of apartheid."]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 18 KYODO -- The main opposition Liberal  Democratic Party (LDP) formulated on Tuesday [18 January] its  1994 draft action program that lambastes the ruling coalition  and shows the party's desire to recapture the reins of  government.    The draft action program, subtitled, "Let's Win Back Power  and Do Our Best To Boost the Economy so as To Protect the  National Life," is scheduled to be adopted at the LDP's annual  convention on Friday.    According to the draft plan, the LDP, toppled from power  last  August after 38 years in power, describes the government of  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa as "a weird government filled  with deception and contradiction."    The LDP asserts its fall from power is not attributable to  its mistakes on policy matters but to its defectors' move to  join hands with other parties in their lust for power, the draft  says, referring to an LDP splinter, Shinseito (Japan Renewal  Party).    It says the Social Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ],  the largest force in the seven-party coalition, is remote from  other partners on its stance on basic policies such as  diplomacy, national security and the partial opening of Japan's  rice market.    In the plan, the LDP also slams coalition member party  Komeito for its alleged violation of the Constitution which  stipulates the separation of religion and politics. Komeito is  backed by a Soka Gakkai, a Buddhist lay organization.    The presence of the SDP and Komeito in the coalition "puts  the Hosokawa cabinet in imminent danger," the draft argues.    In a thinly disguised reference to Shinseito Secretary  General Ichiro Ozawa, who is said to be controlling Hosokawa  from behind the scenes, it says the coalition has shown the  "dictatorial nature" through its management of political and  other issues.    On political reform, the draft action program says the  now-deposed LDP will seek further modifications of a package of  government-sponsored reform measures in its favor and push them  through in the current extraordinary Diet session, due to end on  January 29.    The reform legislation, aimed at rooting out rampant  political corruption, cleared the House of Representatives in  mid-November and is pending in the House of Councillors.    The LDP and the coalition still remain apart on the final  shape of the bills, including the balance between single-seat  constituencies and the proportional representation system for  new lower house elections.    To ensure its comeback to power, according to the draft, the  LDP should repent from its lawmakers' involvement in an array of  past scandals, boost its self-cleansing power and give strong  discretion and power to the party president and party  organizations.    The draft program calls for the LDP to continue its stance  against turning Japan into a military superpower in favor of  amendments to the Constitution.    Noting Japan should occupy a permanent seat on the United  Nations Security Council, the LDP will raise awareness of  Japanese people on the matter, the draft says.</p>

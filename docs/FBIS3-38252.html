Both ministers agreed to hold joint military exercises in  Autumn, this year. They did not talk about the date by which  Poland will become NATO member but confirmed the opinion that  Partnership for Peace is the first step in this direction.    Kolodziejczyk and Ruehe also summed up cooperation between  the Polish Armed Forces and the Bundeswehr. This cooperation  will include contacts of Polish and German Navy on the Baltic  Sea, exchange of commanding experience, the training of Polish  soldiers in the Bundeswehr training centres, and the exchange of  officers and lecturers from military academies.    In Kolodziejczyk's opinion, Poland ranks first among former  Communist countries in military cooperation with Germany. He  said that Germany wants to provide Poland with organizational  and technical assistance on Poland's "way to European security  structures." The German side supports the idea of joint  military training, especially at the lowest level of a company.    The minister announced that bilateral contacts will  intensify  after 31 August when the Russian Army leaves Germany.</p>

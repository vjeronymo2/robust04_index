			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In response to the public hearing requests, the Service is reopening the comment period and has scheduled two public hearings on the proposal to list these five mussels as endangered species. The comment period on the proposal originally closed on September 12, 1994. The comment period is being reopened from November 23, 1994, through December 30, 1994, to accommodate the hearings and to allow additional time for written comments. Written comments received during this time period will become a part of the administrative record and will be given the same consideration as oral comments presented at the hearings. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The first public hearing will be held December 13, 1994, in the Auditorium at the York Institute, Route 127 North, Jamestown, Tennessee, from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. central standard time. The second hearing will be held December 15, 1994, in the 3rd floor Circuit Courtroom, Marshall County Courthouse, Public Square, Lewisburg, Tennessee, from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. central standard time. Those parties wishing to make an oral statement for the record are encouraged to provide a copy of their statement to the Service at the start of the hearing. In the event there is a large attendance, the time allotted for oral statements may have to be limited. However, there is no restriction on the length of written statements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Written comments mailed to the Service should be submitted to the office indicated in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  section.

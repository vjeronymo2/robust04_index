			<p><P> September 5, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NFL SAYS IT WILL REVIEW SCRAMBLING  </P> <P> The NFL announced Tuesday that its decision to scramble its fall telecasts is  being "reviewed" by the league and the television networks.  </P> <P> "In light of everything that's happened, we need to review the situation," said  Greg Aiello, the NFL's director of communications.  </P> <P> "We're reviewing the scrambling issue with the networks, and no games will be  scrambled until that review is completed."  </P> <P> Nevertheless, Aiello said the NFL remains committed to scrambling, not only to  preserve the relationship of the major networks to local affiliates -- whose  advertising is not seen via satellite "feeds" -- but also to "prevent bars and  restaurants from stealing our private signals (by using satellite dishes).  </P> <P> "I think everyone agrees that that is against the law, and we're just trying to  find the proper way to enforce it."  </P></p>

			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Crackdown on fraudsters should be intensified Sir, The status of the City of London as the premier global financial centre is one of the UK's most important assets. However, this position is at risk because large fraud is a growing problem. Recently, there have been initiatives by the government, the Securities and Investments Board and the accounting institutes to increase the detection rates of fraud. These initiatives are to be commended and should result in some increase in the level of detection of City fraud and abuse. However, they are not enough - prevention is better than cure. Touche Ross believes that there is further scope to crack down on fraud. Fraudsters are tempted to deceive auditors and regulators because the laws in this area are weak and not being enforced as vigorously as they should be  -there is no effective deterrent. This problem can be overcome by making knowingly deceiving an auditor or regulator an arrestable offence with a maximum custodial sentence of five years. Also, any person who commits such an offence should be made liable (without indemnification from any other party) for any losses that arise. We believe that more prosecutions focused on such an offence would be a useful deterrent not only for would-be fraudsters but also for their cronies and subservients whose participation is usually essential to perpetrate a large fraud. It would also result in a tougher and quicker system of prosecution and trial which provides better value for money. Toughening up the law on deceiving auditors and regulators could have another useful effect. Because big fraud usually involves deceiving auditors or regulators or both, tougher laws in this area could open the way to some deregulation of City rules and regulations, many of which are directed towards more minor abuses. By removing some of these rules and regulations, the war against fraud would be better focused and could even help London enhance its global position by reducing the burden on honest businessmen who would have nothing to fear from new laws in this area. Ultimately, what matters most is that fraudsters should be made to pay dearly for the damage that they inflict on their victims. Those facing fraud charges should not receive legal aid while continuing to live the 'life of Riley'. It is time we cracked down on fraudsters and stopped them hurting their victims, who are often the weakest members of society.

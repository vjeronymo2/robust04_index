			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / Israeli troops kill three Palestinians in occupied territories Israeli troops shot dead three Palestinians in the West Bank yesterday, bringing to 10 the number of Palestinians killed in the occupied territories since last Friday and raising the death toll since Israel's expulsion of 400 alleged Islamic militants to Lebanon in mid-December to 41, Hugh Carnegy writes from Jerusalem. Some ministers have expressed alarm at the casualty rates and called for tougher rules for the use of live fire. But Mr Yitzhak Rabin, prime minister, said the army wanted more, not fewer, tools to combat the Palestinian uprising. The army yesterday released on bail two reporters for Reuters news agency in the Gaza Strip arrested on Sunday while filming unrest. Meanwhile, Mr Rabin said Israel has 'more than a right' to continue to receive Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.9bn) in annual economic and military grants from the US despite pressures in Washington for cuts in foreign aid. He spoke after meeting Senator Patrick Leahy, head of a senate sub-committee on foreign aid.</p>

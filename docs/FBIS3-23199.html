			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Did State Police Official Spy for </F> Terrorists in Libya?"]    [Text] The Hochenbichler case is escalating: What did the  high-ranking State Police official have to do with the Libyan  intelligence service and the East German "Commercial  Coordination Empire"?    Hochenbichler, who is seriously ill [with cancer of the  throat], still denies that he spied for a GDR embassy secretary.  However, Interior Ministry investigators speak of a "dense  network of evidence." Investigations are now extending in the  direction of Libya. Hochenbichler reportedly had close contacts  with a Libyan intelligence service agent. For many years  al-Qadhdhafi's capital of Tripoli was considered the point of  departure for sensational attacks. This ranged from OPEC  terrorist "Carlos" to the jumbo crash in Lockerbie.    The Cologne Federal Office for the Protection of the  Constitution [BKA] has a Stasi document in its possession. The  document, which is labeled "top secret" and has the file number  000898, lists Stasi measures to support Arab terrorists. A  brief excerpt:    -- creation of logistical bases in the GDR capital with the  inclusion of GDR citizens;    -- promotion of travel by liaison people of the Carlos group  to the FRG and other West European countries;    -- efforts to acquire weapons, explosives, money, and  information;    -- inspiration for acts of violence of armed struggle,  including individual actions, attacks, etc. against the  imperialist policy of the United States, the Zionists, and the  clique around al-Sadat.    Contact addresses were the embassies in Yemen, in Baghdad,  and in Tripoli.  <H5>  Man in Vienna Became Very Interesting </H5>   To put it clearly: All terrorist attacks organized via  Tripoli were supported logistically by the Stasi. This makes a  Vienna State Police official interesting for the GDR foreign  espionage service "HVA" (Foreign Intelligence Collection Main  Administration), because the most important counterespionage  activities of western security authorities went across  Hochenbichler's desk.    The investigations also get a new dimension as a result of  the allegedly close contacts between Hochenbichler and former  GDR Foreign Trade Minister Gerhard Beil and Rudolfine  Steindling, a Viennese businesswoman and the trustee of the  Communist Party of Austria. The Berlin public prosecutor's  office thinks that both played a central role in the "Koko"  empire (Commercial Coordination) of GDR foreign currency  acquisitor Alexander Schalck-Golodkowski. Multi-digit billion  sums were allegedly transferred illegally to other countries via  Koko. An arrest warrant has been issued for Steindling in  Germany.    The hunted woman enjoys Hochenbichler's sympathy. After all,  he was able to welcome "Red Fini" at his private party on his  50th birthday in the Vienna Police Directorate. "Poor Fini,"  the official pitied her, must now "invest millions in lawyers."  Steindling's lawyer, Dr. Harry Neubauer, cannot say what links  Hochenbichler with the businesswoman. However, he rules out  that Hochenbichler's name turns up in the comprehensive Koko  trial files.    Beil, who is considered to be one of the architects of the  Koko empire, is reportedly an old, intimate friend of  Hochenbichler's. The state police official liked to boast of  this friendship. At the Federal Office of Criminal  Investigations, State Protection Department, Koko Chief  Schalck-Golodkowski stated for the record that Beil had been an  "unofficial employee" of the HVA "for decades." "In particular  in Austria" he was working "unofficially."</p>

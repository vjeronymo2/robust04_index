			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Canadians sign aeroengine deal in Russia PRATT &amp; WHITNEY Canada, a subsidiary of the US enginemaker, announced yesterday a deal with Klimov, the Russian company, to make aircraft power plants. Mr GilIes Ouimet, the Canadian company's executive vice-president, said the two companies had agreed to create a joint venture which would produce its first engine by the end of 1994. They planned to be able to build 100 engines a year, he said. Having been one of the first western companies already to clinch a Russian aircraft deal, by providing engines for a jointly-produced aeroplane with Ilyushin, Pratt &amp; Whitney yesterday presented a first joint venture to manufacture engines for helicopters and smaller aircraft. The establishment of the joint venture by the Klimov design bureau in St Petersburg and Pratt's Canadian offshoot highlights the demand for superior engines to match superior Soviet aircraft frames. Mr Alexander Sarkisov, general constructor of the state-owned Klimov, which has designed 90 per cent of the engines in Russian helicopters, was unmoved by suggestions he was betraying the Russian engine industry. 'We will devote as much capacity as the market can take for making engines with Pratt &amp; Whitney,' he said. He also stressed, however, that the engines would be sold and serviced for roubles, not hard currency, at prices which would make them attractive to Russian manufacturers and foreign ventures. Mr Louis Gallois, chairman of the French aircraft-maker Aerospatiale, told a news conference in Moscow that Aero-spatiale, which was 'patiently building' a foundation for future co-operation, would set up, by the end of the year, a jointly-owned company with Russia's Mil enterprise to build the Mi-38 helicopter, a 13-tonne machine designed for heavy loads and public works. If Pratt &amp; Whitney's joint venture produced concrete results, he added, the Franco-Russian partners might consider buying engines from it.</p>

			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Observer: Crunched gears And now, the end of the road for the car that made a Lada feel luxurious - the Zaporozhets, the box that mobilised Soviet citizenry. The last rolls through the factory gates on Thursday, 34 years after Nikita Khrushchev, who called it the 'tin can,' first gave the go-ahead for its mass production in the Ukraine. Viktor Suzalenko, chief of research at the plant is more polite, describing it as a 'no-frills car,' adding that 'style or how much fuel it drank was not an issue when it was designed. The key question was whether it could cope with the rotten roads in the Soviet Union.' Foreign competition and inflation have been its undoing. In 1960 the basic model cost 20 times average monthly pay, but today it is 87 times the typical Ukrainian monthly salary, equivalent to Dollars 870. At that price, surely there's a thriving export market somewhere?</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The subject of economic efficiency at each  individual work center is at the heart of the discussions in the  assemblies process being massively held by the CTC [Cuban  Workers Federation] and its unions, as of today, in the same  spirit as the recently held Parliaments in the Workplace. These  assemblies began last month as pilot assemblies and will  continue through the month of June, with the objective of  avoiding marathons and favoring proper preparation of these  meetings, which should be open and free of preconceived outlines.    The national leadership of the CTC has told its unions to be  demanding regarding administrative reports, which may not  contain justifications, but must instead be very objective about  what needs be done at the work center to (?prioritize)  difficulties and achieve efficiency. (?To begin) the assemblies,  last Monday's [9 May] TRABAJADORES editorial will be read. That  editorial is about this process.</p>

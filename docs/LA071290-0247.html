			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MAX JACOBSON: TAME THAI: SKILLFUL BUT SUBURBAN  </P> <P> Thainakorn of Laguna Hills specializes in Isarn cuisine, the blistering hot  fare of northeast Thailand, but instead of serving these dishes a la  Thailandaise -- fired up with heaps of chile, ginger and garlic (as the  original Thainakorn in Buena Park does) -- the kitchen offers little more than  occasional puffs of smoke, tame signals of yet another style of cooking being  toned down to what a restaurant supposes Americans want.  </P> <P> The one saving grace is that things are handled with considerable skill. While  not a restaurant that piques the senses, Thainakorn manages to be a reasonably  good one.  </P> <P> Those familiar with the Buena Park Thainakorn also will miss the buzz of  activity there: the crowded takeout area, the insouciant service, the lively  Thai clientele. Thainakorn-Laguna Hills is a suburban restaurant with suburban  manners: the decor is soft and relaxing, the service solicitous and discreet,  the crowd subdued. The first things you notice about the Buena Park restaurant  are the barbecue case and the small group of Thai women crowded around woks in  the open kitchen. The first things you notice in Laguna Hills are a "happy  hour" sign and a row of deco ceiling fans, turning languidly as if the tropics  were ever so near.  </P> <P> They aren't, but here's a tip. As you pass the blackboard by the door, stop for  a closer look. A list of specials is written on it in both Thai and English,  and these are likely to be best dishes here.  </P> <P> If you're lucky, one will be Thai sausage, the best reason for a visit. It's a  dense, reddish pink sausage loaded with garlic, ginger and kha (a cousin of  ginger whose English name is galangal) that crackles appetizingly on the  outside. You eat it with mint leaves, sliced cabbage and a sticky sweet sauce  the Thais call nam gai. Try it Isarn style with little clumps of sticky rice  served from a tiny bamboo basket. It's a wonderful treat, as good as anything  I've eaten in Thailand.  </P> <P> Here's another tip: After the Thai sausage, be as daring as possible. You won't  find frog or eel on this blackboard, as you would in Buena Park, but there  might be Chinese watercress (pak bung), a hollow stalk that is alluringly  sweet. The chef sautes it to delightful crispness with boiled, fermented soy  beans. This substantial side dish will grace any entree, particularly seafoods.  </P> <P> Wild boar (moo pa) is another blackboard special of interest. It has a fine,  firm texture and a good gamy flavor. I just wish the sauce, Thainakorn's  generic red curry paste with too much lemon grass and not enough chili, was as  special. That sauce seems to crop up often on the regular menu.  </P> <P> The regular menu contains just over 50 dishes. Unfortunately, repetition of  sauces means less variety than meets the eye. When dishes are starred in red,  by the way, it's to indicate that they are house specialties, not to warn you  about degrees of hotness. Many are pretty bland.  </P> <P> One good dish is phad Thai, flat fried noodles with shrimp, bean sprouts,  crushed peanut and a heap of sweet red chiles alongside. It seems that everyone  who comes here eats this dish and I can understand why. The noodles are chewy  and fresh, and the kitchen is generous with the shrimp.  </P> <P> One dish that doesn't get away with its blandness is tom yum kung, a "hot and  sour" shrimp soup that turns out to be embarrassingly sweet. If you feel like  something hot and sour, try gang luong par bang, hot and sour soup with  catfish. They aren't pulling their punches nearly as much on this one.  </P> <P> One appetizer that scores is nam sod, a minced salad of pork, crushed peanuts  and red chile. Eat it with fried "crispy rice" and some long beans and cabbage  and wash it down with ice cold Thai beer. Another is neua dad deal, a hard Thai  beef jerky you eat with a murky but savory brown bean sauce. But I didn't much  care for neua nam tok, barbecued beef on a bed of sour vegetables. The taste of  kha and lemon grass overpowered the beef, which was stringy and underdone.  </P> <P> Entrees include the usual barbecues like chicken and catfish, and a host of  meats cooked in curry paste or garlic sauce. The barbecued chicken is tasty but  on the dry side and not quite punchy. The stir-fried pork with pepper and  garlic is also quite dry; it needs a good sauce. I didn't try the barbecued  shrimp salad with Thai dressing, but if it's half as good as it is in the other  restaurant, it should not be missed.  </P> <P> Thainakorn is not real big on dessert. There is a homemade coconut ice cream  and occasionally something called rum mit: jackfruit, coconut milk and noodles  flavored with padang leaf served in a soup bowl. This dessert is very much like  what you'd actually get in Thailand. Too bad there aren't more dishes like it  at this restaurant.  </P> <P> Thainakorn is reasonably priced. Appetizers and salads are $4.95 to $6.95.  Soups are $5.95 to $9. A la carte dishes are $5 to $16. Combinations are $4.95  to $9.50.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THAINAKORN  </P> <P> 24401 Ridge Route, Laguna Hills  </P> <P> (714) 586-0596  </P> <P> Open for lunch and dinner Tuesdays through Thursdays 10:30 a.m. through 10:30  p.m., Fridays through Sundays 10:30 a.m. through 11 p.m.  </P> <P> MasterCard and Visa accepted.  </P></p>

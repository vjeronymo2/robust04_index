			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Construction Contracts: Oberhausen development project The P&amp;O company BOVIS INTERNATIONAL has been appointed construction consultant for a proposed city centre redevelopment scheme at Oberhausen, on the outskirts of Dusseldorf. The city has long been a centre for the manufacture of steel products and recent refinements in one of its fabrication yards has provided a 200 acre site. Now the City of Oberhausen has brought in Stadium Developments, developer of Sheffield's Meadowhall shopping centre, to create a local centre connecting the city districts of Alt-Oberhausen and Osterfeld. Planning consent is currently being sought to build a complete city district, incorporating shops, offices, sports and recreation facilities, parks, restaurants, hotels and media centres.</p>

At the meeting, participants confirmed that actions had been  decided on 24 cases. Among actions to be taken are:  Deregulation on activities of lawyers specialized in foreign  legal affairs; changes in food product labels to have the  expiration date indicated; and improvement of customs procedures  for handling imported cargoes after business hours.

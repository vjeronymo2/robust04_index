			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Feng I-fan (7458 0076 0416): "Delay of New Airport </F> Project Is Beneficial to Chinese Side"]    [Text] Affected by the deadlock of Sino-British  relationship, whether the project of Hong Kong's new airport can  be completed by 1997 as scheduled is a big question. Hong Kong  Governor Patten said that he wished to return home at the end of  his service here by taking off from the new airport. Now, it  seems that his wish will probably come to nothing. Unless there  is a dramatic solution of the dispute over the political system,  or the Chinese side can really handle political and economic  issues separately, there will be no chance of smoothly carrying  out the new airport project. Even though the two sides are  forced to resume talks, nothing will come of it.  <H5>  Kai Tak Airport Was Built Half a Century Ago </H5>   The present Kai Tak Airport was built 50 years ago, and its  facilities and capacity have reached the limit. Last year, Kai  Tak Airport handled 24.5 million passengers, exceeding the  maximum figure originally set. If the new airport cannot be put  to use in three to four years, the load that Kai Tak will have  to face will be inconceivable. According to the figures  provided by the Civil Aviation Department, a total of 6,700  flights were refused landing at Kai Tak Airport last year, which  means 1.4 million passengers were unable to come to Hong Kong.  This is absolutely detrimental to the development of Hong  Kong's tourism, industry, and commerce.  <H3>  Direct Flight Across the Taiwan Strait Will Ease the  Pressure on Kai Tak Airport </H3>   The Chinese side is not opposed to the construction of a new  airport. However, it is politically unacceptable to China if  the project is allowed to be completed before 1997 by Britain  and the Hong Kong Government, and there may be other factors for  consideration in terms of economics and practice value. First,  one of the major causes that made the saturation date of the Kai  Tak Airport come earlier than expected is that large numbers of  Taiwan and mainland passengers are travelling via Hong Kong, who  account for approximately 40 percent of all the passengers  arriving here. If Taiwan and the mainland can make certain  arrangements for direct flights, and mainland passengers can use  the Shenzhen airport which is close to Hong Kong and the Macao  airport which will soon go into operation as much as possible,  the pressure on Kai Tak will be considerably lightened. In a  period of time to come, the problems that have hampered  coordinated operations of Kai Tak and its nearby airports will  be reduced or resolved following the handover of Hong Kong and  Macao to mainland China one after the other. So long as the  transregional cooperation is smoothly carried out, the  saturation point of Kai Tak may be put off for some time, thus  providing sufficient conditions for the new airport to be  gradually completed after 1997.    Moreover, the official completion of the new airport project  after 1997 not only will bring honor to Beijing and the Hong  Kong Special Administrative Regional Government, but the  arrangements for the use of land after Kai Tak terminates  operations will be entirely in the hands of the SAR Government  and Beijing, as it will no longer be necessary to consult anyone  representing the interests of Britain or other countries. With  expensive land prices in Hong Kong, the vast area of Kai Tak  Airport and relaxation of building's height in the entire  Kowloon Peninsula will bring profits up to several dozen billion  dollars to the SAR Government. Naturally, the Chinese side will  not let the British side concern itself with these considerable  profits now when it still administers the territory.  <H3>  The Chinese Will Not Make Concessions in the New Airport  Project </H3>   Taken politically or economically, the Chinese side will not  make concessions in the new airport project. Whether Britain  and the Hong Kong Government still cherish any illusions about  this will be judged by their future actions. Even though both  sides return to the negotiation table, they will be nothing more  than the nature of putting on performances. Perhaps, those  consortia waiting for contracts of project facilities and  supplies need more patience. At least, this spectacular and  controversial new airport project will not become a reality  until after 1997.</p>

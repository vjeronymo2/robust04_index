			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / Arts: A Crypto- Christmas concert Monday's concert by the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment was not billed as fare for the festival. Yet it was almost that, with not only Corelli's 'Christmas' Concerto, but the secular cantata by Bach that he would soon cannibalise for his Christmas Oratorio. The sentiments of the original cantata, however, were hardly seasonal; and in this performance they began to seem downright queer. 'Hercules auf dem Scheideweghe', BWV 213, was one of those occasional baroque encomia designed both to honour a royal patron, and to urge him along virtuous paths. In this case, he was the frail, crippled Prince Elector of Saxony, and the occasion was his eleventh birthday (I am drawing on Nicholas Anderson's programme-note). To inspire him, Picander's fairly awful text represented the hero Hercules at a 'crossroads' where he must choose between Wollust (heedless sensuality) and Tugend (virtuous decency). His choice, thumpingly signalled from the start, is of course Tugend, whose voice joins his in a climactic duet of surrender. But most of us know this duet well from the Christmas Oratorio, where soprano and bass - with obbligato twin oboes d'amore - give thanks for divine mercy; it was disconcerting to hear it from the mouths of a male alto (Hercules) and a tenor, with an androgynous pair of violas, to quite different words: 'I am yours, I am yours. I kiss you, oh kiss me, etc'. Especially since Wollust had been so sweetly and subtly impersonated by the soprano Barbara Bonney - though Paul Agnew's Tugend was fervently upstanding, and for the young Hercules Ralf Popken's ultra-elegant line was expressive to the point of exacerbation. Forswearing any speculation about male-chorister life in 1730s Leipzig, we may prefer the 'Christmas' adaptations of most of this music that Bach made the next year. All due thanks, nevertheless, to the veteran conductor Gustav Leonhardt for re-animating the original score; and for an engaging, characterful performance earlier of the 'Coffee' Cantata BWV 211, with Agnew as narrator, Bonney as the caffeine-addicted daughter and David Wilson-Johnson as her despairing father. If his light, dry bass lacked the substance for ripe comic effect, he acted hard to compensate; in fact Bonney's soprano too has lost the fresh bloom that we first admired in her Rosenkavalier Sophie, though her mature art is delightful. The Corelli sounded uncommonly refined, in beautifully graded hues of grey. Exploiting the range of their period-style bowing, the OAE strings were more searching and delicate than ever. Still, this evergreen 'Christmas Concerto' is actually a concerto grosso with a prominent duo of solo violins: would Corelli's Roman band really have been led by such mild, soft-grained, self-effacing players - impeccably musical though they were - as we heard here?</p>

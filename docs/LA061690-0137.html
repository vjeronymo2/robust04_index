			<p><P> June 16, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> TANKER OWNER ASKS FOR LIMIT ON LIABILITY  </P> <P> The company whose tanker was involved in the Feb. 7 oil spill is asking a U.S.  District Court to limit its future liability for the disaster to $8 million,  which will likely force Huntington Beach into a legal battle to recover  potential costs for environmental damages, city officials said Friday.  </P> <P> American Trading Transportation Co.'s petition, filed in U.S. Central District  Court in Los Angeles, claims the company was not responsible for the spill and,  therefore, should be exempt from paying any damages in addition to the $20  million the firm says it has already spent in cleanup and emergency-response  costs.  </P> <P> But if the company is found to be at least partially at fault, the petition  asks that its additional liability not exceed the $8-million value of the  American Trader, the 800-foot oil tanker that dumped nearly 400,000 gallons of  crude into the ocean off Huntington Beach. The vessel, hauling British  Petroleum's oil, apparently punctured its hull on its own anchor while mooring  1 1/2 miles off the coast.  </P> <P> The legal request was filed in response to a U.S. Coast Guard report last month  that concluded that the Golden West Refinery Co., owner of the offshore  platform where the tanker was heading, was partly to blame for the accident,  said David Woolley, a Long Beach-based attorney representing American Trading.  </P> <P> "Because the Coast Guard hearing was very favorable to our client, we don't  want cities and other government agencies suing us for megabucks," Woolley said  Friday.  </P> <P> American Trading has paid Huntington Beach $250,000 as a partial payment of  $554,000 in claims by the city for response and cleanup costs and lost  beach-parking revenues, city finance director Dan Villella said. The payment is  part of the $20 million the company says it has spent so far in connection with  the spill.  </P> <P> For the past three months, city officials have been working with state and  federal agencies in hopes of billing the firm for extra costs beyond those  directly related to the response to and cleanup of the spill. Those charges  likely would include reparations for harm done to local wildlife, damage to the  coastline and perceived tarnishing of the city's public image, Villella said.  </P> <P> Although no price has yet been attached to such alleged damages, city officials  have said the cost could total as much as tens of millions of dollars.  </P> <P> City Atty. Gail C. Hutton said she perceives American Trading's petition as "a  way of getting out of expensive damages" owed to the city. "What's the damage  of not being able to see pelicans again in Bolsa Chica? And what about the loss  of fish? Or days lost at the beach? These are all questions that need to be  answered," Hutton said.  </P> <P> To get those answers, the City Council on Monday will consider hiring a Long  Beach-based legal consultant who specializes in admiralty and maritime law to  further study the possibility of a suit against the owner of the vessel.  </P> <P> Mayor Thomas J. Mays said Friday he is determined to recoup costs for  environmental damage, whether by negotiated settlement or court action.  </P> <P> "We knew that with these 'soft' costs we would run into some legal problems,"  Mays said. "But if we can justify these costs, and (American Trading) decides  not to cooperate, then we'll have to go to litigation." JOHN PENNER  </P></p>

The FPI says that although Ibarra was given  amnesty, he is now being sentenced to 20 years. "We are giving  the government a 72-hour deadline to release our leader  unconditionally. Otherwise, we will hold the executive  responsible for whatever happens in the country after the  deadline expires," they said.    The FPI has also reported Commander Halcon missing and said  they expect an answer from the government as to the whereabouts  of that leader.    Former Lieutenant Colonel Ibarra benefited from an amnesty  decreed by the government at the time of his surrender. The  courts, however, have revoked that ruling and sentenced Ibarra  to 20 years for the death of Dr. Arges Sequeira Mangas,  president of the National Association of Owners of Confiscated  Property.    The FPI staff also warned that it is in contact with all  recompa forces to fight "this corrupt government, which starves  the people and keeps them unemployed and in anguish." The FPI  also demands that Jose Angel Talavera, alias El Chacal, be tried  and sentenced for assassinating 211 of their Sandinist comrades.  "He is not covered by the amnesty," they said. The FPI leaders  called on Government Minister Alfredo Mendieta "to stop  rewarding the murderers of the people."    The document, distributed to the media, adds: "We laid down  our weapons to contribute to peace, but the government is not  honoring its word. It always violates the agreements it signs.  The government is putting us behind bars and making us  disappear. We will fight to help our people."</p>

			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Ministers raise hopes of Budget for industry The government launched a concerted ministerial drive yesterday to deliver an upbeat message over Britain's economic prospects, raising hopes that Tuesday's Budget will focus on boosting the recovery. The campaign followed a favourable City response to Thursday's Commons hint from Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, that tax rises will fall on consumers rather than business. The FT-SE 100 Index closed 18.3 points higher at 3,111.4, reflecting a widespread judgment that Mr Clarke's comments presage a Budget aimed at increasing industrial production. The impression left by the chancellor was reinforced in a series of ministerial speeches on the economy co-ordinated by Conservative central office. The campaign reinforced growing confidence among Tory MPs that Mr Clarke's main aim will be to stimulate industry and speed up the fall in unemployment. It was led by Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman, backed by several senior ministers. Sir Norman told Conservatives in Worcester that economic recovery was 'well under way'. He said the government would ensure it was 'sustained and sustainable', and that it was not undermined by new costs on business or a spiralling budget deficit. The upbeat message was underlined by Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, who said in Dymchurch: 'Britain is bouncing back, leading Europe out of recession, so the Budget will be building on fundamental economic strength.' Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, told Eddisbury Tories: 'The sure way to jeopardise our recovery is to impose new regulatory burdens on business.'

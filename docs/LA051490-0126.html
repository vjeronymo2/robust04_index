			<p><P> May 14, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> COACH WHO QUIT IN SCANDAL HIRED  </P> <P> Dean Nicholson, who resigned at Central Washington University last month in a  player-payment scandal, was named head coach of Yakima's new entry in the  Continental Basketball Assn. this morning.  </P> <P> The former Sizzlers of Topeka, Kan., have been purchased by Robert Wilson, a  former California state senator who is now an attorney in Sacramento.  </P> <P> He announced the move in a news conference.  </P> <P> Nicholson, 63, spent 26 years as Central Washington's head coach, and is 17th  on the all-time college coaching victory list with a record of 609-219. But it  took the player-payment scandal to push him into the professional coaching  ranks.  </P> <P> Nicholson resigned April 2, the same day a university auditor revealed that he  distributed more than $65,000 earned by his basketball camps to 49 players over  the last three years. A report by a state auditor covering Central's athletic  program is expected to be released this week.  </P></p>

			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Computing: Big package at a small price THE world's best-known word processor is WordPerfect and WordPerfect 5.1 for DOS continues to head the sales charts. It is a big-company product at a big-company price - Pounds 329. To entice private users to spend their own money, WordPerfect Corp in 1991 released LetterPerfect, a slightly cut-down version of WordPerfect 5.1 which costs Pounds 99. Late last year it went further, and released WordPerfect Works for DOS. WordPerfect Works (WW) is an integrated package combining five modules - word processor, spreadsheet, database, graphics editor and communications. It contains a full version of LetterPerfect, the word processor, a version of the full-price spreadsheet PlanPerfect 5.1, a version of the full-price database DataPerfect 2.2, and a version of the full-price graphics editor DrawPerfect 1.1. Finally there is the communications module, one of whose most valuable features is the fax facility which can send documents directly via a fax modem. WW runs on any IBM-compatible computer with DOS 3.0 or higher and with at least four megabytes of free hard disk space. List price is Pounds 109 and I have seen WW advertised via mail order at Pounds 62. WordPerfect 5.1, PlanPerfect, DrawPerfect and DataPerfect together retail for well over Pounds 1,000, yet WW, which combines all four of them, costs a tenth of this. Where is the catch? There is no catch. In practice these versions contain 95 per cent of their full-price equivalents. In the case of LetterPerfect, the only serious loss I can see from full WordPerfect is that it will not handle multiple columns of text (for newsletters, etc). The reason for the low price is that WW is marketed low-key as a SOHO ('small office, home office') product. This puts off the corporate buyer who always has to have the 'power-user' version with all the bells and whistles, even if it costs 10 times as much. There are two potential purchasers of WW. The first is someone who uses WordPerfect 5.1, PlanPerfect, DataPerfect or DrawPerfect at work and wants to be able to run these packages at home. WW has file compatibility with all four. A disk created at work under WordPerfect, for example, can be taken home, loaded on to a machine running WW, and worked on, then taken back to work and loaded onto the WordPerfect machine. To this group WW can be recommended unreservedly. The second, larger group comprises those who are looking for a modestly-priced integrated package to cater for most of their computing needs. For them I am not so sure. WordPerfect has its own peculiar set of conventions different from those prevailing throughout the software industry. For example, the Escape key does not mean Escape; it means Undelete. The Help key is not F1, but F3. WordPerfect Corp does not believe in dialogue boxes, so in order to select options you constantly find yourself having to switch your eyes to the bottom of the screen. This is awkward and gives WordPerfect a slightly old-fashioned feel. However, you can get used to all this. On the plus side, WordPerfect's famous screen display, instead of being cluttered with icons, tool bars, graphics, etc, accommodates a full 22 lines of text. This, plus the full complement of keyboard shortcuts, allows for blindingly fast data entry. The real problem with WW is the manual, which is appalling: 604 pages of text written for trained systems support staff with no concessions to beginners. There is no tutorial; in practice you will have to learn by trial and error. It is astonishing that WordPerfect, which claims millions of users worldwide for its software, should be so hopelessly inadequate at teaching people how to use it. In terms of features per pound, WW is probably the best-value package on the market today, and it is churlish to complain when your Pounds 62 buys you a near-complete version of WordPerfect 5.1, let alone the rest of the package. But WW will not yield its secrets easily. Unless you have a WordPerfect expert on hand to help, you face many hours of head-scratching before you will be able to get it to work.</p>

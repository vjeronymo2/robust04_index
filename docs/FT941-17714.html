			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Better-off more worried about losing their jobs People in high-risk groups for unemployment, such as young males and council tenants, are less concerned about losing their jobs than those in safer groups such as middle-aged southerners with mortgages. According to an analysis of MORI interviews with 9,000 adults between April and December, young people aged 18 to 24 are heavily over-represented among the unemployed, forming 34 per cent of the total, but only 20 per cent say they are 'very concerned' about being made redundant. Conversely, the interviews show that 35 to 44-year-olds with housing and child-rearing commitments are considerably less likely to be unemployed, forming only 11 per cent of the total - yet 23 per cent of them are 'very concerned' about losing their jobs. In the south of England, with 34 per cent of the unemployment total, 44 per cent of people said they were worried about unemployment, compared with only 22 per cent in the north, which contributes 31 per cent to the unemployment total. Council tenants form 42 per cent of the unemployed, but only 15 per cent say they are 'very concerned' about losing their jobs. Mortgage payers on the other hand form only 28 per cent of the unemployed but 64 per cent are 'very concerned' at being made redundant. Social classes DE, the semi-skilled and unskilled, form 66 per cent of the unemployed but only 25 per cent fear redundancy. Social class C2, skilled manual workers, form only 16 per cent of the unemployed but 38 per cent are very concerned about job loss. 'What we find in general terms is that fear seems to follow the pattern of employment, rather than unemployment,' said Mr Simon Braunholtz of MORI, who carried out the analysis for Industrial Relations Services. 'This suggests that either those in the high risk categories feel it 'couldn't happen to me' or are hardened to the possibility of unemployment by past experience or peer group experience,' he said. For the low-risk groups it is evidently financial commitments which drives their fears, so an upturn in the economy could in theory substantially reduce anxiety without producing any important change in their likelihood of becoming unemployed.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Jordan's King Husayn during a visit to the Hebron </F> Charity Society in Amman on 26 February to offer condolences for  the victims of the Ibrahimi Mosque attack in Hebron--recorded]    [Excerpts] In the name of God, the merciful, the  compassionate. Think not of those who are slain in God's way as  dead. Nay, they live, finding their sustenance in the presence  of their Lord. [Koranic verse]    My presence and that of the brothers here among you, our  dear  kinsfolk, our men and enduring ones--knowing that we have always  been one family--is something natural. [passage omitted]    We previously talked about the issue of religious  jurisdiction and the need to focus on this dimension. Thus, as  far as the Islamic holy places and other places and our  sanctities are concerned, jurisdiction should be the  responsibility of the Islamic nation as a whole. This talk was  a responsible and objective one.    I believe that the sad and tragic chain, including setting  fire to the al-Aqsa Mosque, repeatedly encroaching on the  Christian holy places, and yesterday's tragedy, is clear proof  that we can only continue to demand that this religious  sovereignty be that of God the almighty alone, and also of his  worshippers who are able to protect their holy places and who  can vie with one another for the fear and respect of God.    O kinsfolk and brothers, be sure that we will work to the  best of our ability, so heads will remain raised and will only  bow to God the almighty. We will defend justice, and, as  always, we will have solid positions in the face of any  manifestations by some to disregard our right, the right of our  kinsfolk and brothers on their national soil.    There was much talk about peace. We sincerely and honestly  proceeded toward peace. However, it should be an honorable and  just peace which will be accepted by the coming generations. It  is not, and will not be, capitulation.    God knows the magnitude of the pressures we are facing. You  are well aware of the challenges and dangers we faced in the  past and which we are facing now with clear vision and  cooperation. We are the pioneers of those who call for Arab  convergence, cooperation, fraternity, honesty, and good faith,  and we will continue to be so. O kinsfolk, brothers, and dear  ones, be sure that had I personally been an obstacle to this  Arab convergence, I would not have remained one moment in this  position. [applause]    This speech is not a new one. Many fraternal Arab leaders  heard this speech years ago. However, we will renew the call  for convergence and cooperation in fulfillment of the duty  toward the coming generations. We only seek to satisfy both God  the almighty and our conscience. Here, with reason, awareness,  and the insistence on controlling our nerves more than before.  [sentence as heard] We should also organize our ranks, endure,  and be ready to bear more pressures. [We should maintain] the  splendid picture which used to be, and which will continue, of  this (?one) family in order to face the challenges and fate of  this universe. Help ye one another in righteousness and piety,  but help ye not one another in sin and rancor. [Koranic verse]    God bless you all. May God grant us strength to endure his  will. We have not forgotten for a single moment the kinsfolk and  brothers, nor will we forget for one moment our duties toward  them. We will optimally do what we can, with God's help. May  you be safeguarded by God, the protector of the march. God the  almighty is the one who grants success. We hope we will  constantly meet in better circumstances than these ones.    Once again, we all extend to the dear and beloved kinsfolk  and brothers in Hebron much love, appreciation, and pride in  their steadfastness. We also extend all sentiments of sharing,  which we will embody to the best of our ability at present and  in the future, and under all circumstances, in terms of bearing  what they have endured and facing what they continue to endure.  We are with them, with God's help. May God's peace, mercy, and  blessings be upon you.</p>

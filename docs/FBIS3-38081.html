As he said, Russia's Foreign Ministry sent an inquiry to the  headquarters of the UN Protection Forces in the former  Yugoslavia. "According to the preliminary data available to the  headquarters, the Bosnian Serbs' planes were returning to their  base after a bomb strike on a military plant controlled by  Bosnian Muslims. If this is indeed the case, the Bosnian Serbs  violated one of the UN Security Council's resolutions adopted  more than a year ago. The resolution bans flights by military  planes in the air space of Bosnia-Herzegovina," he said.    According to the diplomat, the "closed skies" resolution has  been repeatedly violated by Bosnian Serbs, Muslims and Croats.  "They all were aware of the possible "adequate military"  measures toward "the violator." However such measures were not  taken till today," he said.    Russian diplomats who scored in the past two weeks  considerable successes on the road of settling the crisis in  Bosnia by peaceful means had repeatedly warned the Serbs, Croats  and Muslims against the possible provocations "by field  commanders or whoever else," Interfax's interviewee pointed out.  "Now what we warned against and what we feared has happened," he  said.</p>

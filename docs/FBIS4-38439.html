			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Account of speech delivered by Russian President B. Yeltsin </F> in Moscow 27 May: "Boris Yeltsin: We Have No Surplus Land.  Russian Federation President's Speech at Ceremonial Meeting  Devoted To Border Guard Day, 27 May 1994"]    [Text] Esteemed Border Guards!    Dear Veterans!    I first want to cordially congratulate all defenders of the  border and also your families on your professional holiday --  Border Guard Day.    On behalf of the whole Russian people I express my thanks  and  gratitude to you for your selfless service to the fatherland!    There are veterans of the Border Guards in this room.  Several generations of Russian citizens have been raised on  your exploits. I express sincere gratitude to you for your feats  of arms defending the borders of our motherland. I do not doubt  that you are still at your posts. Your experience and knowledge  are needed even today.    Russian border guards worthily preserve and continue the  traditions of older generations. On this day I cannot fail to  point out that in 1993-1994 alone six servicemen in the Border  Guards were awarded the title of Hero of the Russian Federation  [RF]. More than 400 border guards have been awarded Russian  orders and medals.    Russia's border guards protect the borders of our fatherland  sometimes at the cost of their own blood. They sometimes pay  with their lives to ensure the security of the state and uphold  Russia's interests.    We bow our heads to those who have died defending the  borders  of our fatherland. We will always remember them, their feats in  the name of Russia. I ask you to observe a minute's silence in  glorious memory of those who died doing their military duty.    Esteemed Border Guards!    I think that you will understand me if I talk first about  the  problems facing the border guards today, on the eve of your  professional holiday, our common holiday.    Our fundamental aim is to build a strong democratic state.  One of its main attributes being effective protection of the  State Border.    In many respects it is here that the fate of Russia's  territorial integrity, sovereignty, and security is decided.    In two weeks the Federal Border Service [FBS] will celebrate  its second anniversary. You are having to work in an extremely  complex and in many respects new situation. Tense conditions of  service, the lack of amenities for units and subunits on the new  borders, and other difficulties have been unable to disrupt your  work.    The fundamental reorganization of the system of guarding  Russia's border is being actively carried out with consideration  for the new geopolitical situation.    I assess positively the work to systematically withdraw  border guard groupings from Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and  Azerbaijan and deploy them on the border with the Baltic  countries and in the North Caucasus. The Western Group of  Border Guards and the Caucasus Special Border District have been  created within a very short period.    The Border Guards are taking an active part in maintaining  a stable situation on Russia's borders and the external borders  of the Commonwealth states.    I want to underline the importance of the tasks that you are  preforming in the hot spots and particularly in the combat  conditions on the Tajik-Afghan border. Far from the motherland  our border guards are guarding its national interests. Let me  be blunt and say that they are defending Russia from war with  might and main.    Personnel have remained loyal to their duty, manifesting  their best qualities. On all the borders the border guards are  largely successful in performing their tasks.    The period that has seen the formation of the FBS can be  said  to be coming to an end. The foundations of qualitatively new  troops have been laid. A base for their development exists.    The State Border is defended in spite of everything. And I  am convinced that the stability of Russia's borders will  continue to grow stronger.    A conference with the FBS leadership has just come to an  end.  I can say on the basis of its results that as president I fully  support the line being implemented by your Service.    The correct course has been taken of organizing a civilized  Russian border. It accords with the principles of a democratic,  federative, rule-of-law state which are enshrined in the RF  Constitution.    While there is no concept of national security the FBS  shoulders a considerable share of the responsibility for  Russia's fate. It cannot be any other way!    Adopting a formal approach and waiting for instructions --  in  our conditions -- is the best sign that things will go wrong.  Now when state mechanisms are being fine-tuned and when the  normative base is still only being formed initiative --  responsible initiative, furthermore -- is not just a boon but  the most important factor of the viability of the state.    I am glad that the FBS is up to the task. You have set a  high standard and are actively searching for new and original  solutions. I thank you for this, Andrey Ivanovich Nikolayev, I  thank you all.    Border troops face new and more complex tasks. Previously  the State Border was a frontier which divided our country from  the world and partitioned off the peoples.    Now we have to ensure that the border becomes an impregnable  wall only to threats to Russian national interests and the  security of the state.    The border must be closed to terrorism, drugs trafficking,  smuggling, and illegal immigration by foreigners.    The most important task facing border troops is to prevent  armed provocation.    At the same time the State Border must not be an artificial  obstacle to the development of cooperation, business contacts,  communication between people, and spiritual ties. We will  create a firm legal basis for that.    Russia needs a long-term state border policy. I can state  with full responsibility that we have a clear notion of the  borders and zones of protection of Russian interests. We can  see clearly the role and place of the FBS in the national  security system.    It is your service which is called upon to organize the  elaboration of border policy and establish stable cooperation  with all the interested departments in implmenting it.    In this connection I shall express our fundamental position:  Russia has no territorial claims on any country. We want the  civilized solution of the border demarcation problem. But we  will firmly defend the interests of the Russian Federation's  territorial integrity. We in Russia have no surplus or  unnecessary land!    Experience in the adoption of well-balanced state decisions  on border questions is now being accumulated. You have an  insider's understanding of all these problems. And is it you  who must take a clear stand and uphold it more boldly.    The protection of the border is not just a matter for the  Border Troops. It is a most important task for the whole state,  all state structures, components of the federation, and organs  of power in the border regions.    At the conference with your leadership we discussed the  results of Putina-94, the border operations in the South Kurils  sector, and Zaslon-4, the border operations in the Pskov sector,  and a number of other operations.    They are important not just as realistic examples of  cooperation among border troops, army men, sailors, intelligence  and counterintelligence officers, the customs services, and  local organs of power.    Such operations produce a tremendous economic effect which  can be calculated in billions of rubles.    It is hard to overestimate the political significance of  these operations. The more actively we conduct them the more  Russia will be respected in the international arena.    But even that is not the main thing. The first reports on  Zaslon and Putina produced a sigh of relief from many people.  "At last they have begun to establish order! At last they have  dealt a blow to those who are tearing our national assets to  shreds."    Each of your successes restores people's hope, dignity, and  sense of pride in their country.    The important thing is that such operations should not be  irregular but systematic in character. They must be held in  other sectors at land and sea.    Act energetically and resolutely in the future, too. Know  that the Russian leadership and I will give you support.  Russia's interests in all sections of the state border must be  reliably protected.    Russia's borders are new. A significant part of them adjoin  new states. There is much work ahead to ensure their definitive  shaping and equipping.    What are the approaches to the protection of the border by  the Border Troops of the Russian Federation?    The issue here must not be solely the use of force to  protect  our borders. State border policy must be based first and  foremost on political and diplomatic approaches.    This presumes the peaceful and nonviolent solution of  disputes as they arise, the development of cooperation in the  protection of the border with neighboring states, and the use of  armed forces and methods only in extreme circumstances.    It is necessary to involve the inhabitants of border  regions,  especially the Cossacks, in the protection of the border.  Especially since they have expressed a desire to do that.    It is important to do this primarily in the new areas of the  border where such traditions have not been established yet.    The specifics of the political situation demand a  differentiated approach to the protection of the borders. I  shall dwell on that question in greater detail.    With such states as Norway and Finland, for example, Russia  has firm relations of partnership. Our borders are equipped and  their protection must be carried out on principles of  good-neighborliness and cooperation.    As for the Baltic countries, Russia advocates the  development  of good-neighborliness with Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia and  the expansion of cooperation with them. But these states do not  belong to the CIS and therefore the border regime there must be  a full-fledged one [polnotsennyy]. Its protection must be  organized correspondingly.    Russia's border with Belarus is transparent. The external  border is protected here by Belarus. We have assumed  commitments to participate in shared financing of its border  structures. The question of protecting the Russian-Belarusian  border does not figure on the agenda.    The protection of the border with Ukraine will be structured  in keeping with the measures taken by the Ukrainian side. We  have discussed this today at the conference. But, given the  common history of our peoples, we would like to resolve this  task through joint efforts.    I endorse the Federal Border Service's efforts in organizing  the protection of the border in the Caucasus along two lines --  on the external borders of the states of Georgia and Armenia and  on Russia's state border. At the same time, it is essential to  step up the work of preparing the Memorandum on Joint Protection  of the Borders in this area.    Everyone knows that there are outstanding issues here. These  relate to questions of our security -- not just the security of  the state but the security of actual citizens and their  families. They must be resolved as quickly as possible.    A good basis for developing the cooperation of Commonwealth  border structures has been created in the Central Asian region,  namely the Memorandum on the Joint Protection of External  Borders. Collaboration on this basis should be increased and  consolidated.    Attention must also be paid to strengthening the protection  of the border with Mongolia. Given the dynamics of our  relations with China, I also regard it as feasible to carry out  the protection of the state border here on the principles of  cooperation.    It is essential to improve the protection of the border in  the Arctic and Pacific regions and to take measures to defend  Russia's economic interests.    Interstate cooperation in border protection is an important  function of the border service. Such cooperation has already  become a reality in a number of sections of the state border.  And we maintain that line.    It is important to apply this experience not just to the  border structures of Commonwealth states but to those of other  neighboring countries too.    This is a real mechanism for guaranteeing collective  security. This is the way toward consolidating stability. And  not just on the border but in the states themselves.    The border troops's participation in active peacemaking  activity is equally important. This is a new task for border  troops. You are successfully tackling it in the North Caucasus  and the Central Asian regions. It is difficult to overestimate  its significance! I will say frankly that you have saved  thousands of lives of citizens of not just Russia but certain  other Commonwealth states too.    Participation in maintaining political stability in the  Russian border zone is an important area of activity for border  troops.    The border troops have always been active exponents of state  policy in the border regions, and people have understood you.  Given the special nature of this moment, I regard this task as a  priority.    It is essential to develop small-scale diplomacy -- the work  of border missions and other forms of cooperation among border  structures -- everywhere.    You will thereby help to the maximum extent the conduct of  the Russian Federation's foreign policy course.    I want to draw special attention to the need to tighten up  military discipline without fail.    I am convinced that the task of reliably protecting the  border cannot be resolved unless the task of strengthening law  and order within the troops is resolved.    Esteemed border troops,    You are faced with large-scale and difficult tasks. Their  successful fulfilment will depend on the sense of  responsibility, initiative, and effectiveness of the command and  staffs and the coordinated work of all organs of command and  control.    It is essential to bring the Law "On the Russian Federation  State Border" and other state and then departmental statutory  instruments into line with the Constitution as rapidly as  possible.    I keep a constant watch on the preparation of laws, the  absence of which creates a vacuum in the defense of Russia's  political and economic interests on its state boreder.    I know that the border troops are beset by quite a few acute  and painful problems. They are basically down to the pretty  difficult socioeconomic situation that obtains in the country.    We will help you solve them primarily by provision of  finance, facilities, and accommodations.    We will take measures to enhance the social and legal  protection afforded servicemen, members of their families, and  veterans.    I stress that this will be done by enhancing, not reducing,  protection. Various rumors circulate in places on this  question. Therefore I confirm my position of principle: I will  not -- as president -- allow any restriction on the social and  legal benefits enjoyed by servicemen.    From time immemorial the Russian people have regarded the  border troops with love and respect. I am sure that we will  remain true to that glorious tradition.    You protect the borders of the fatherland. The border troops  are supported in this by the huge might of Russia. Russia knows  and believes that you protect its peace and security, whatever  this may cost you.    Once again I congratulate the generals, admirals, officers,  warrant officers, petty officers, sergeants, soldiers, and  sailors of the Border Troops, workers and employees, and members  of the families of border troops on your upcoming professional  holiday.    I wish you, esteemed border troops, success in the difficult  service you perform on behalf of the Russian state!    I would ask you to convey my sincere congratulations on your  holiday to all those who perform border service on the borders  of the motherland and to your nearest and dearest!</p>

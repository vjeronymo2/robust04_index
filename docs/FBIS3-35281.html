We welcome him to Voice of the Arabs.    [Basindwah] I thank you for phoning me. I wish you and  Egypt--its president, government, and people--prosperity,  success, stability, and peace in this blessed month of Ramadan,  the month of fasting and virtue.    [Al-Jundi] Hours after the signing of the pledge and accord  document, news agency reports spoke of clashes between northern  and southern Yemeni forces. What is your full assessment of  these clashes?    [Basindwah] I want to be true with the listeners of the  Voice  of the Arabs because the Voice of the Arabs has accustomed us to  the truth. Undoubtedly, there are elements in the Yemeni  Socialist Party [YSP] who want to consecrate secession as a fait  accompli. Within this context, some forces--the Unity  Brigade--moved from Hadramut to the Abyan Province contrary to  the agreement banning any military movements. These forces,  which fall under the YSP command, moved to Abyan Province to  provoke the 'Amaliqah forces. A clash occurred, in which  innocent Yemenis died. We do not consider the dead from the  south as non-Yemenis and we do not consider the dead from the  north as non-Yemenis. In our view, they are all Yemenis and  they are the sons of our one people. We must save their blood.  We do not want a Yemeni to be killed by another Yemeni. We want  to stop the bloodshed. The clash was part of a plan to prevent  the signing of the document. We had hoped that 20 February of  this year would be the day Yemen overcame its crisis.    [Al-Jundi] While we share with you this hope, it is a fact  that both President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Vice President 'Ali  Salim al-Bid want to contain any crisis that might arise. There  are direct orders by both men that these events should be  contained.    [Basindwah] Yemen is dear to us. We must safeguard the  security and peace of its people. We want stability to prevail  throughout our homeland. We do not want any part of the  homeland to be exposed to dangers. Yemen's unity does not  concern one particular person or party but concerns all Yemenis.  In my opinion, any attempt to break up this unity is treason.    [Al-Jundi] Allow me to submit a clearer question. How  effective is the pledge and accord document at this particular  time?    [Basindwah] I believe all our people have rallied around  this  document and there is a national consensus on it. However,  there are elements who are trying to spoil the good and  encouraging atmosphere created by the signing of the pledge and  accord document. We must implement this document because it no  longer belongs to its signatories but to all the Yemeni people.    [Al-Jundi] The pledge and accord document was signed in the  presence of the Arab League secretary general and a  representative of Omani Sultan Qabus and under the sponsorship  of King Husayn of Jordan. Did the participation of these  figures in the reconciliation of the Yemeni factions represent  an Arab desire to contain this crisis?    [Basindwah] Undoubtedly, the presence of the Arab League  secretary general and the Omani minister of state for foreign  affairs as a representative of Sultan Qabus indicates a  collective Arab desire for Yemeni unity. We had hoped that the  Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the Arab Republic of Egypt, the Syrian  Arab Republic, the Gulf states, and other Arab states would have  attended the signing of this document. We know that all these  states are concerned about Yemen's unity. Regardless of  attempts by some people to cast doubt on our relations with  fraternal and dear states, we will remain loyal to these states  and retain for them amity, respect, appreciation, and gratitude.    [Al-Jundi] How do you envisage future events in Yemen?    [Basindwah] I believe our Yemeni people will rally around  those who are eager for Yemen's unity. They will stand against  all those who try to dismember Yemen. Those who are defending  Yemen's unity and the march of democracy will triumph. I am  confident of this because it is a historic inevitability.</p>

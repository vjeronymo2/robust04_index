			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Xiao Liu: "Cash-Flush Banks Fearful of Inflation"] </F>   [Text] Individual savings grew steadily in the first  quarter of this year despite double-digit inflation and the  spending frenzy during the Spring Festival holiday.    However, experts predict a tough time for banks in the  coming  months if the inching up of prices isn't brought under strict  control.    At the end of March, bank savings topped 1,662.5 billion  yuan  ($191.1 billion), up 35.8 per cent from the corresponding period  last year.    The monthly growth rate reached a high of 6.8 per cent in  February, compared with 2.5 per cent in January and 2.77 per  cent in March.    Wang Zhiqiang, a savings official for the People's Bank of  China, the central bank, said the growth rates are among the  highest in recent years and mark a big improvement from March  1993, when private savings plunged because of high inflation,  illegal schemes for raising capital, and low interest rates.    Wang attributed the growth to high interest rates and the  government's continuous efforts to bring order to the country's  financial system.    "Actually," Wang said, "the strong momentum appeared last  May  when the central bank raised interest rates to reverse the  decline in bank savings."    Wang said the decision by the People's Bank of China to peg  the interest rates for deposits with fixed terms of more than  two years to the inflation rate also helped diminish depositors'  worries over losing the real value of their savings.    Meanwhile, with pay reform spreading across the country,  many  government units raised employees' salaries during the quarter.  Most of the extra income has been set aside in bank savings,  Wang said.    In addition, many investors disappointed by the sluggish  stock market are turning to banks for a safe place to keep their  idle cash.    Also, to prevent too much capital being drained away from  savings and treasury bonds, the People's Bank of China has  decided to suspend the development of investment funds.    "Overall, China can still expect a steady growth in bank  savings this year," Wang said. "But the pace may slow down."    He said individual savings may decline in the second quarter  because of the sale of 87 billion yuan ($10 billion) worth of  treasury bonds, which began on April 1 and will end on June 30.    "The treasury bonds, with their increased liquidity,  shortened term and higher interest rates, are selling well  across the country. This will no doubt siphon off a considerable  part of the bank savings," Wang said.    High inflation is another big threat to savings, he said.    The inflation rate in the first quarter was 20.1 per cent,  and even surpassed 30 per cent in some cities such as Haikou.  At the same time the interest rate for one-year bank deposits  remained at 10.8 per cent.    If not narrowed, the gap may trigger a consumer buying spree  that would soak up a lot of ready cash.    "If the price hikes continue, it will be a very difficult  time for banks," Wang said.    In fact, rising prices at the end of last year sparked a  buying binge especially in big cities, and led to a slowdown in  the growth of bank savings.    Meanwhile, Wang said that with the country taking strides in  housing reform, more government units are selling homes to  employees. This, in turn, means that people will spend more for  housing and draw down bank savings, he said.</p>

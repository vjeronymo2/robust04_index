			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Better scrutiny of Scots law is urged THE GOVERNMENT should enable specifically Scottish legislation to be given better and more detailed consideration, according to the journal of the Law Society of Scotland, which represents Scotland's 8,000 solicitors. The society says the government should 'give power to some body' for the better consideration of Scottish legislation. This body could be a Scottish parliament, an assembly, the Commons committee on Scottish affairs or the Scottish grand committee, which is the committee of all Scottish MPs. The society believes most Scottish lawyers would object to the creation of an extra tier of government in Scotland and to the issuing of more Scottish legislation. The Edinburgh-based society, a statutory body, has not taken part in the constitutional debate since the late 1970s. The government is likely to examine the option of giving more power to the Commons committee, which was not formed in the last parliament, and to strengthening the Scottish grand committee, which meets occasionally in Edinburgh as well as London. There has been speculation that it might create some forum without tax-raising powers.</p>

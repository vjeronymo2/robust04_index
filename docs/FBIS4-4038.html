			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["China's Politics and Economy" column by Hua Hsia (5478 </F> 1115): "Zhu Rongji Again Shows the True Qualities of a Czar"]    [Text] Faced with the grim economic situation, Vice  Premier Zhu Rongji has once again shown the true qualities of an  economic czar. From 12 to 17 April, Zhu Rongji inspected  Heilongjiang Province, dismissed Governor Sun Weiben from office  face-to-face, and ordered former Liaoning Governor Yue Qifeng to  take over the post of Heilongjiang governor.    This move caused great shock in the CPC's internal circles,  because since the founding of communist China there has never  been a central leader who ordered the dismissal of a provincial  governor face-to-face. Zhu Rongji's inspection tour of  Heilongjiang and his face-to-face dismissal of a provincial  governor is unprecedented in the history of the CPC. He was  very high-handed.    During the inspection tour of Heilongjiang, Zhu Rongji took  with him a dozen heads of ministries and commissions; the  entourage, powerful and mighty, went directly to local places to  inspect work and give instructions. The work style was highly  efficient and very decisive.    There are two main reasons for such a show of force. First,  the leadership in Beijing wants to assert its authority and pose  in a way which shows that the central leadership can control the  overall situation and manipulate it easily, so as to strike at  the recent arrogance of local economic lords. When the National  People's Congress was underway in March, Zhu Rongji severely  criticized the often self-important Guangdong Province. Zhu  Rongji accused the money-rich Guangdong of frequently going to  various provinces to buy grain, to the extent of triggering a  rapid increase in grain prices and disturbing the people's  minds. Zhu Rongji said to the Guangdong delegation that if  Guangdong has the money, it may buy grain from foreign  countries, but it should not act recklessly on the mainland. His  words created an unharmonious atmosphere.    Another reason is that Heilongjiang has many state  enterprises, and therefore it is a very heavy burden; these  enterprises keep asking for money from the central leadership,  causing great trouble for Beijing. Consequently, Beijing  decided to change the governor in the hope that the move can  open a way for Heilongjiang.</p>

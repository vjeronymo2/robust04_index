In order to permit the pilot program to continue without interruption, the Exchange also requests that the existing program be extended for an additional six month period in order to provide the Commission with the further opportunity, if necessary, to assess the operation of the program beyond February 8, 1994. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Amex original requested that this pilot program be extended for an additional three months. However, at the Commission's request, the Amex has agreed to extend the pilot until August 8, 1994, in order to provide the Commission with further opportunity to review the Exchange's request for permanent approval of the pilot procedures. See Amendment No. 1,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> , note 1.

For purposes of the pilot program, odd-lot limit orders that are immediately executable based on the Amex quote at the time order is received, at the trading post or through PER, are executed in the same manner as odd-lot market orders. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

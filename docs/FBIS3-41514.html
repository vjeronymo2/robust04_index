			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Lanzhou, January 21 (XINHUA) -- Chinese scientists  have made breakthroughs in the study of gas geochemistry,  promoting the country's exploration of oil and gas, and study of  the changes of the global climate and environment.    This science, which is only about a decade old, involves  research into natural resources, and changes of climate and  environment, and forecasting and prevention of geological  disasters.    China's key laboratory for gas geochemistry was set up at  the  Lanzhou Institute of Geology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences  in this capital of northwest China's Gansu Province in 1985. It  was opened to foreign scientists in 1991.    Since then, Chinese scientists have made great progress in  research into the storage and transformation of oil and gas,  changes of global climate and environment, and seismic  activities.    Since 1991 the laboratory has completed 792 major research  projects designated by the state, related state ministries and  Gansu Province.    Chinese scientists at the lab have put forward a new theory  of ``multi-sources and continuous formation in different  stages'' for the formation of natural gas.    Meanwhile, they have made new progress in the study of  geological structure, volcanoes and earthquakes by using helium  isotopes.    They have also developed a series of new technologies and  methods for the exploration of oil and gas, which have made  great contributions to the development of the Tarim Basin in the  Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.    At a state project appraisal meeting, some well-known  scholars described the lab as a showcase of China's study of gas  geochemistry, calling it an international center of the science.    The lab has academic exchanges and cooperation with many  countries and regions, including Germany, the United States,  Sweden, Russia, Japan and Italy.</p>

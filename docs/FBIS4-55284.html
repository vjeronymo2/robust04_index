			<p>BFN     [Text] Croatian President Franjo Tudjman has expressed  satisfaction with the Vienna agreement. He was informed about it  by Mate Granic and Kresimir Zubak upon their return from Vienna.  Haris Silajdzic, head of the Muslim delegation, described the  agreement as the most specific step toward peace, the  implementation of the Washington agreement, and the constitution  of the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation. President Alija  Izetbegovic said that the agreement is a good one, but that the  Muslims will continue to insist on a unitary state and on  preserving its external borders.</p>

			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ELECTIONS 34TH SENATE DISTRICT;  </P> <P> SCRAPPY LAWMAKER CHALLENGED BY GOP MAVERICK;  </P> <P> REPUBLICANS: ASSEMBLYMAN CHARLES BADER, WHO HAS CARVED OUT A NICHE ON EDUCATION  POLICY, WANTS A SENATE SEAT SO THAT HE CAN HAVE A CHANCE TO SHINE.  </P> <P> During his first seven years in the state Assembly, Charles Bader says, he  jogged about five miles a day, four days a week.  </P> <P> But during the past year, the Pomona Republican has abandoned his regimen while  running in the biggest race of his political career: challenging veteran state  Sen. Ruben S. Ayala (D-Chino) in Tuesday's election. Colleagues say Bader  jumped into the Senate contest partly because, in the Assembly, he felt as if  he was merely running in place.  </P> <P> Bader can point to few major legislative accomplishments, largely because many  bills he sponsored, such as one to beef up penalties for drug dealers,  ultimately failed to win passage.  </P> <P> At the heart of Bader's problem is a simple political fact of life -- in a  chamber that has been controlled by Democrats throughout his eight years in  office, the chances for a Republican to shine are few. And he has been further  handicapped by being at odds with the Assembly's GOP leadership, which  generally has been more conservative than him.  </P> <P> Bader, 50, acknowledged feeling frustrated by the inability of Republicans "to  get their names on a bill" that passes the Assembly.  </P> <P> So he had to settle for a behind-the-scenes role. He said he took his cue from  a political axiom that goes: "You can accomplish anything you want in the  Legislature as long as you don't worry about who gets credit for it."  </P> <P> As a consequence, Bader, whose wife is a school principal, carved out a niche  for himself as a Republican voice on education policy. He also established a  reputation as an open-minded GOP backbencher -- someone Democrats could  occasionally split off from his Republican brethren on a given issue, such as  encouraging industry to cut toxic air emissions.  </P> <P> Said one GOP Senate aide, who asked not to be named, "He's not at all a  right-wing 'caveman' type. He's a reasonable, moderate Republican."  </P> <P> The aide added that Bader probably would feel more at home in the less  partisan, more collegial atmosphere of the upper house, even though it is also  controlled by Democrats.  </P> <P> Among his Assembly accomplishments, Bader cites his role on several education  proposals, including a successful effort by GOP lawmakers last year to redirect  $14 million from urban to suburban school districts.  </P> <P> In 1986, Bader also noted, he participated in negotiations that led to a  compromise, five-year plan to ease school overcrowding and build thousands of  new classrooms throughout the state.  </P> <P> The key bill, sponsored by a Republican colleague, allowed school districts to  levy a housing development fee of $1.50 per square foot. That measure, however,  stirred confusion over which developments qualified for the fee. So Bader in  1988 pushed through a bill that spelled out the type of projects eligible for  the fee. It also blocked districts from raising the amount charged to  developers.  </P> <P> Bader said that prior to those bills, there was no state program to relieve  school overcrowding -- a major issue in the 34th Senate District that he is  seeking to represent. The district encompasses Pomona and western San  Bernardino County.  </P> <P> But his views on education have prompted criticism from the California Teachers  Assn., which supports Ayala. Ed Foglia, the group's president, said Bader  "talks a good line, but he really doesn't deliver" for the education community.  Foglia said Bader consistently votes "against measures that would put more  money into public education."  </P> <P> Bader countered that his goal "is not just to provide more money, but to cut  the dropout rate and improve test scores" for students.  </P> <P> Symptomatic of the divergence in views between Bader and the CTA, the teachers'  group last year handed the assemblyman a failing grade in its legislative  report card.  </P> <P> He receives much higher marks from the California Chamber of Commerce, which  listed the lawmaker as having followed its recommendations 90% of the time  during the 1990 legislative session.  </P> <P> Another conservative lobbying group, the National Rifle Assn., reported that  Bader sided with it on 100% of its measures.  </P> <P> Bader scored much lower on an environmental score card. The League of  Conservation Voters, the political arm of the environmental community, said he  sided with them 35% of the time on floor votes in 1990.  </P> <P> Bader's rating with the political arm of the state AFL-CIO -- traditionally  aligned with Democrats, also was low. The group said he took a pro-labor  position only 18% of the time in 1989.  </P></p>

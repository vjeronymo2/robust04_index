			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 42 (532)] </F>   [Text] President Mircea Snegur is satisfied by the  preliminary results of the parliamentary elections held Sunday  in Moldova. He told reporters that with the coming to power of  the Agrarian-Democratic Party which won a convincing victory,  there is no ground to believe that Moldova's political course  will change. As to the success of the Socialist Party and the  "Unity" Movement which were second at the elections, the  president said that candidates to parliament from the party,  will be able to join the Agrarian Party and conduct the course  of reforms. INTERFAX Note: As of Wednesday morning,  preliminary results of the elections indicate that the  Agrarian-Democratic Party has won 43.7% of votes, the  Socialist  Party and the Movement "For Equality and Unity"--22% and  election alliance of peasants and intellectuals--less than  9%,  the Christian-Democratic People's Front--7.35%. This means  that Agrarian Democratic Party will receive approximately 55  deputy mandates out of 104 and will be able to form the  government by itself, without resorting to creating a coalition  body of executive power. Snegur hopes that the new parliament  will be able to solve the problem of Transdniestria. He  believes that the proposal of the CSCE standing mission which  grants Russia the role of a mediator is the basis for settlement  of the conflict in the region.    Snegur said that he means the democratic Russia. If  nationalist forces come to power in the Russian Federation,  Moldova will be able to defend itself by resorting to help of  international organizations, of which it is a member.    The president has favored the unconditional withdrawal of  the  14th Russian army and said that it is the army of a foreign  state and must be withdrawn from the territory of the  independent republic of Moldova.    Snegur called the sociological poll scheduled for March 6, a  political event of primary importance for the strengthening of  the independence and statehood of Moldova. (On that day the  citizens of the republic will be asked to answer the question on  the prospects of the further development of the republic and the  state's policies -- "INTERFAX").    Speaking Tuesday with the leaders of the commissions  responsible for the poll in provinces, the president said that  it was time for the president to address the nation, the most  consistent judge which can distinguish between the right and the  wrong. He believes the parliamentary elections on February 27  showed convincingly that the people can make the right choice.    The president believes the forthcoming sociological poll  will  positively influence the strengthening of statehood and  independence of Moldova and its results will tell on the  adoption by parliament of a new Constitution.    Snegur also said that for explanatory activities, about 100  representatives of the government will go to the republic's  provinces. Snegur said that 310 thousand Moldovan lei,  approximately $80,000 will be set aside from the budget for  conducting the poll.</p>

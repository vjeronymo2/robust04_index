			<p><P> February 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> On a unanimous 5-0 vote, a Senate committee voted Wednesday to confirm Gov.  George Deukmejian's appointment of Robert K. Best as new director of the state  Department of Transportation. The Senate Rules Committee vote sent the  49-year-old Best's nomination to the floor of the Senate, where final  confirmation is expected to be nothing more than a formality. Best, a former  attorney with the conservative Pacific Legal Foundation and a deputy director  of Caltrans in the 1970s, has been acting head of the state's huge highways and  transportation agency for the past 10 months, pending confirmation.  </P></p>

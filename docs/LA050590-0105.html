			<p><P> May 5, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: SANTA PAULA;  </P> <P> 15-YEAR-OLD HELD IN THEFT OF ICE CREAM  </P> <P> A 17-year-old ice cream vendor was beaten and robbed of 140 ice cream bars in  Santa Paula, authorities said Friday.  </P> <P> Police took a 15-year-old girl into custody about 4:30 p.m. Thursday after  discovering the vendor's cart turned over in her front yard and the bars  stuffed in her freezer, Santa Paula Police Cmdr.  </P> <P> Bob Gonzales said.  </P> <P> The vendor, from La Tapatia Ice Cream of San Bernardino, was hawking the snacks  from his pushcart on Pleasant Street when two males and a teen-age girl beat  him and ran off with his cart, Gonzales said.  </P> <P> The vendor's name is not being released because he is a minor, a Police  Department spokeswoman said.  </P> <P> The vendor, badly shaken by the experience, told police that he had been "hit  all over," Gonzales said. But he did not require medical attention and was not  taken to a hospital.  </P> <P> No money was taken. The robbers were after only the frozen goods, Gonzales  said.  </P> <P> Police discovered the cart on its side in front of the girl's house about a  block away on Walnut Street, Gonzales said.  </P> <P> Police are searching for the two males, believed to be juveniles, Gonzales  said.  </P></p>

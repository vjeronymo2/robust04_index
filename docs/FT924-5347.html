			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Commons to debate Maastricht next week THE government yesterday honoured its pledge to resume work on legislation to enact the Maastricht treaty before the Edinburgh summit on December 11 and 12 by declaring that the committee stage will begin next week with two days of debate. But even before the official announcement, Lady Thatcher issued a fresh rallying call to Euro-sceptics in a speech she gave in Germany on Wednesday. The text was released in Westminster yesterday. Addressing an audience of bankers and politicians in Frankfurt, the former prime minister paid compliments to the monetary rigour of the Bundesbank while also praising the UK government for adopting an independent economic policy after the sterling devaluation of September 16. She also backed German opposition to any dilution of the D-Mark in a unified European currency, described economic and monetary union as a federalist project and warned: 'Scepticism is on the increase.' In the Commons yesterday, Mr Tony Newton, leader of the House, gave notice that the government would press on with debate on the floor of the Commons next week in a process that ministers acknowledge could continue at least until the end of May next year. He assured one pro-treaty MP that plenty of time would be given to the bill to ensure the adequate debate of amendments. The limited two-day start to the ratification process, with no further dates yet set, underlines the government's determination to play the process low-key and long. Further discussion of the bill may not begin until the House of Commons returns from its Christmas recess in mid-January. In Whitehall, meanwhile, attention is now firmly fixed to the run-up to the EC summit in Edinburgh and preparation of the fine detail of the gathering's heavy agenda. Ministers have made clear that the British presidency hopes to use the meeting to reach broad conclusions to key questions such as the treaty addenda for Denmark.</p>

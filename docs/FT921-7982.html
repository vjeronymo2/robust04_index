			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Survey of Contracted Business Services (8): The caterers are growing fat - The sector is buoyant EVEN FOR an industry well known for bucking recessions, contract catering is witnessing remarkable growth, with a 21 per cent increase in outlets, and a 35 per cent increase in meals served since 1988, according to the latest survey by the British Hospitality Association. The sector boasts a workforce of 90,000 and an annual turnover of Pounds 1.4bn; a far cry from its roots half a century ago when the law forced employers with more than 250 staff to provide 'wholesome meals at reasonable prices' to boost morale. Several factors have kept the sector buoyant in the current recession, leading many observers to believe that contract catering is the natural base from which, eventually, 'total facility management' will evolve. While many contract caterers are consolidating their market in the recession and refusing to dilute their expertise and energies by diversification, there is little doubt about the trend for the 1990s. Gardner Merchant, one of the big three with a turnover of Pounds 751m, provides a typical example. In 1991 it took on a contract at BBC Wales' Cardiff headquarters, with a turnover of Pounds 1.2m. Nine services are provided within the building: printing, mailroom, catering, ground maintenance, switchboard, porters, and two subcontracts provide maintenance and security. The trend is bolstered by the sector's current strength. Sutcliffe Catering, also among the big three with a Pounds 340m turnover, claims cost savings of 10-20 per cent over client-run contracts and a 10 per cent improvement in uptake. In the depths of recession, these savings are irresistible. Fixed price contracts are on the increase, putting a high risk factor on the caterers, as against the traditional management fee system where the client meets costs. Government policy on privatisation, the internal market in the health service and reform of education services have all provided spectacular growth. Figures from the British Hospitality Association show a jump from 250 healthcare outlets in 1989-90 to 337 in 1991-92: similar figures for the ministry of defence are 68 and 190; and for state education from 262 to 450. The Food Safety Act has also played a significant role, placing on employers the need to demonstrate 'due diligence' in the event of food poisoning as well as enforcing a code on training, temperature control and storage. Many companies now use contract caterers as a form of insurance. While contract caterers originally helped boost wartime morale, many companies now employ caterers to enhance company image. Compass, also in the big three with a Pounds 265m turnover, found in a survey last July that 46 per cent of respondents saw company catering as a perk, valued more highly than a company car. Innovative ventures are becoming more common in the sector as is the search to find new markets. Sutcliffe has set up a joint venture with BP Oil at Hemel Hempstead, north of London, using the petroleum company's facilities to provide general catering and a turnover of Pounds 100,000. New markets can range in from British Telecom's 600 outlets to the Youth Hostel Association or P&amp;O Ferries. Diversification is not limited to the big three. Kent-based Russell &amp; Brand, with a 1990 turnover of Pounds 7.58m, has picked up 100 contracts in three years and offers a total facility management package including 24-hour close circuit TV security. Perhaps the real challenge facing the sector as a whole is whether it can protect its market in a post-recession economy.</p>

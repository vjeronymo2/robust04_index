			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Accountancy bodies at loggerheads on reform The president of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales yesterday attacked a plan by the certified accountants' body for the reform of the profession as 'dead on arrival'. Mr Roger Lawson described the idea of a General Accounting Council for the UK and Ireland as a 'wheeze' put forward by the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants. The dispute puts in serious doubt the ability of the profession's six leading bodies to move forward with the so-called Bishop proposals for reform. That scheme, which is being presented to the memberships in various consultation processes, envisages the merger of the six bodies on a regional basis. The association's plan, put forward by its president Mr John Moore, instead urges the creation of a new umbrella group and the preservation of the existing bodies. While it defends the scheme as a genuine attempt to find a way forward for all six leading bodies, it was seen as a serious blow to the Bishop plan. Mr Lawson's reaction, delivered to a meeting of chartered accountants in the Thames Valley area, was dismissive. 'The accountancy profession as a whole would have abdicated its responsibilities to its members and to the public to some sort of quango of questionable accountability. 'The principal effect of the recent idea put forward by ACCA would have been to transfer effective control to a minority of government and other external nominees. 'I cannot believe that that is what most of the accountancy profession would have wanted. It is certainly not what I want to see for my members. 'For this critically important reason I regarded the ACCA idea as dead on arrival, if not actually still-born.' Mr Lawson said reform had to deliver better standards of qualification and professional performance and a better use of resources.</p>

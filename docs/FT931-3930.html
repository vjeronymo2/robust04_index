			<p>930312 FT  12 MAR 93 / International Capital Markets: Bell Atlantic cuts stake in Telecom NZ BARCLAYS de Zoete Wedd has bought 109m shares in Telecom Corporation of New Zealand, worth around NZDollars 297m (Dollars 156m), from Bell Atlantic Holdings, reducing Bell's stake by 4 percentage points to just under 30 per cent. The New Zealand government sold Telecom NZ to the local subsidiaries of two US telecommunications companies, Bell Atlantic and Ameritech, in 1990, with the requirement that they should reduce their joint holding to under 50 per cent by September 1994 (recently extended from September 1993). BZW is distributing the shares to investors in Europe and elsewhere, in conjunction with ABN Amro and Caisse des Depots. Nomura Securities will open a branch in the Japanese city of Akashi, Reuter reports. The new branch raises Nomura's retail network to 149 outlets.</p>

			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Letter: Costly transfer from France Sir, My Europhilia has been badly dented by finding Pounds 21.36 debited from a Pounds 180 cheque cashed on a French bank. To soften the blow my local bank informed me it had foregone its usual handling fee because it thought the charge was excessive. This kind of charge is not unusual, I am told. Apparently, there is virtually no recourse as the French bank debits its costs at source while my local branch is inhibited from making further enquiries by a Pounds 7 head office charge for every telex sent. Nice work if you can get it, one might say. Perhaps our beleaguered financial services industry may still have something to offer Europe in transparency and competition. Alan Mackie, 66 Canonbury Road, London N1 2DQ</p>

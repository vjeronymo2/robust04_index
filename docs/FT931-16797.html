			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / World Trade News: Plan for free trade zone irks Israelis - Bureaucrats scorn proposal by American-Jewish businessmen THE American-Jewish community has long been an economic and political lifeline for Israel, but beneath the surface there have been tensions. A proposal by a group of Jewish businessmen in the US that Israel establish a free export processing zone (FEPZ) has now brought the tensions into the open. The battle pits backers of the Israel Export Corporation, set up to establish an FEPZ, against an array of senior officials in Israel's key economic ministries. In the middle are Mr Yitzhak Rabin, prime minister, and Mr Avraham Shochat, finance minister, who have yet to decide whether to give the scheme the go-ahead. The FEPZ proposal appears an almost irresistible lure to a government anxious to reverse negative net foreign investment and to cut unemployment of more than 11 per cent. The Israel Export Corporation's shareholders include Mr Sy Syms of Syms Corp, a US clothing manufacturer, brothers Robert and Alan Tishman, both in property, and Mr Jay Pomrenze of Bankers Trust in New York. Mr David Yerushalmi, chief executive of Israel Export Corporation, says 14 potential investors who met Mr Rabin last month pledged to create 36,000 jobs and inject more than Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) into an FEPZ. The government is being asked to establish a privately run free-trade zone outside Israel's customs territory, foreign exchange controls and bureaucracy. Apart from national security and environmental legislation, the zone would be excluded from labour and trade union agreements. There would be a 25-year tax holiday, but companies operating in the FEPZ would have no access to Israel's industrial aid and tax incentives. Israeli bureaucrats, however, are far from impressed. A report by a committee set up by Mr Shochat to study the proposal, headed by Mr Yoram Gabbai, head of the state revenue department, delivered an unequivocal rejection. It saw 'legal and economic anarchy' and 'unbearable discrimination' if the FEPZ legislation was enacted. It said evidence of such zones' success in countries like South Korea and Taiwan did not apply to a developed, high-wage economy such as Israel's. It was worried about loss of tax revenue and possible breaches of Israel's free trade agreements with the US and EC. The report also doubted that investment would materialise.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] THE STAR    PAC Decision To End Armed Struggle Welcome -- The  Pan-Africanist Congress (PAC) decision to end the armed struggle  "is an excellent development," declares a page 12 editorial in  Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 18 January. "Yes, many  South Africans will feel angered at Clarence Makwetu's blithe  announcement, after years of disingenuously denying that the PAC  had any control over its armed wing." Although the cease fire  will "take some time to come into force" we "can look forward to  less killing." The country can "look with some confidence  towards a more inclusive election." Ultimately, the "legitimacy  of the transition process has been bolstered by Makwetu's  announcement."  <H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>   ANC Economic Promises -- Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in  English  on 18 January in a page 4 editorial finds the African National  Congress (ANC) alliance's Reconstruction and Development Program  "more specific about the promises" it is making. But, "is it  specific enough about the macroeconomic context in which they  will be delivered?" "It is not enough to say that 'undue  inflation' and balance of payments problems should be avoided.  An overheating economy, with soaring inflation and high  imports, could bring the programme to a premature end. A  stronger commitment is needed on macroeconomic discipline, as  unpalatable as that might be politically."  <H6>  RAPPORT </H6>   Editorial Calls for Moderate Front Against ANC -- The  "Comment" column on page 14 of Johannesburg RAPPORT in Afrikaans  on 16 January analyzes the ANC's election manifesto and its  "so-called program of reconstruction" which it says "even  frightens political appeasers of the past year. Even the most  optimistic of them can no longer believe what they had earlier  announced with great positiveness: That the ANC has renounced  nationalization and that it had become a protagonist of a free  market system with a little tinge of socialism merely for the  sake of its constituency." Hopefully it will make those who  applauded Mr. Mandela's so-called "assurance" more careful. It  appears that as election day draws closer, and the ANC feels  increasingly assured of an election victory, "the organization  is bent on getting its grip on any support it can get hold of --  from education to mines, from land ownership to the civil  service." "It is a good thing that the ANC's ominous future plan  for totalitarian state control and interference became known  just in time -- in time by all moderate people and parties  involved in the present negotiations for a new dispensation."  "Due to the ANC's radical socialist and racist principles, such  negotiations are gaining a totally new urgent dimension. What  is important right now is to stop the ANC on 27 April."  "Participation must be the password to all. The basis for a  broad moderate front against the ANC must be established without  delay. After 27 April it will all be too late."</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule also revises &sect;917.459 to remove four peach varieties from the variety-specific size requirements specified in that section, because less than 5,000 packages of each of these varieties were produced during the 1993 season. In &sect;917.459 redesignated paragraph (a)(5) of &sect;917.459 is revised to remove the Flavor Red peach variety; and redesignated paragraph (a)(6) is revised to remove the July Lady, Red Cal, and Redglobe peach varieties. Peach varieties removed from the variety-specific list become subject to the non-listed variety size requirements specified in paragraphs (b) and (c) of &sect;917.459.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule also amends &sect;917.459 by revising paragraph (b) to change the ending date of the regulatory requirements for the non-listed peach varieties referred to in that paragraph to June 30 from July 2, and paragraph (c) to change the beginning date of the regulatory requirements for the non-listed peach varieties referred to in that paragraph to July 1 from July 3. These changes reflect the sizing characteristics of such peach varieties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, in &sect;917.459 redesignated paragraph (a)(6)(i) is revised to permit as many as 80 peaches to be packed in a No. 22D standard lug box if they are ``well matured'', and redesignated paragraph (a)(6)(iii) is revised to permit as many as 73 peaches in a 16-pound sample if they are ``well matured''. These changes permit certain late-season peach varieties to be shipped to the fresh market at a slightly smaller size than in past seasons, if they meet the higher ``well matured'' maturity standard. The higher maturity standard is important for such smaller size fruit, because it will assure that the smaller fruit is of acceptable maturity and quality to be shipped to the fresh market in the interest of growers, handlers, and consumers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, this rule changes the minimum size requirements for several varieties of peaches packed in loose-filled and tight-filled containers by revising the count-size for peaches specified in paragraphs (a)(3)(iii), (a)(4)(iii), and (a)(5)(iii). These size changes correspond to the weight-count changes made in column 2 of both Table 1 for early-season and mid-season peach varieties, and Table 2 for late-season peach varieties cited in paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of &sect;917.442.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The PCC recommended these changes in the minimum size requirements based on a continuing review of the sizing and maturity relationships for these peach varieties, and the consumer acceptance levels for various sizes of fruit. This rule is designed to establish minimum size requirements for fresh peaches consistent with expected crop and market conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule reflects the committees' and the Department's appraisal of the need to revise the handling requirements for California nectarines and peaches, as specified. The Department's determination is that this rule will have a beneficial impact on producers, handlers, and consumers of California nectarines and peaches.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule establishes handling requirements for fresh California nectarines and peaches consistent with expected crop and market conditions, and will help ensure that all shipments of these fruits made each season will meet acceptable handling requirements established under each of these orders. This rule will also help the California nectarine and peach industries provide fruit desired by consumers. This rule is designed to establish and maintain orderly marketing conditions for these fruits in the interest of producers, handlers, and consumers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After consideration of all relevant matters presented, the information and recommendations submitted by the committees, and other information, it is found that the rule, as hereinafter set forth, will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined, upon good cause, that it is impracticable, unnecessary and contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect, and that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this rule until 30 days after publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  because: (1) California nectarine and peach growers and handlers should be apprised of this rule as soon as possible, since early shipments of these fruits are expected to begin about April first; (2) this rule relaxes grade requirements for peaches and size requirements for several nectarine and peach varieties; (3) California nectarine and peach handlers are aware of these revised requirements recommended by the committees at public meetings, and they will need no additional time to comply with such requirements; and (4) the rule provides a 30-day comment period, and any written comments received will be considered prior to any finalization of this interim final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 7 CFR Part 916  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Marketing agreements, Nectarines, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 7 CFR Part 917  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Marketing agreements, Peaches, Pears, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons set forth in the preamble, 7 CFR parts 916 and 917 are <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  amended as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 916_NECTARINES GROWN IN CALIFORNIA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

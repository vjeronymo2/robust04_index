			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Technology (Technically Speaking): Swiss vote yes to animal testing The Swiss are generally known to be sensible about most things, but they have developed a surprising tendency recently to shoot themselves in the foot. Thus, there was considerable anxiety in some quarters as the latest in a long series of referendums on the difficult question of animal rights approached. On Sunday, the demand by animal rights activists that nearly all experiments on animals be halted was rejected by an unexpectedly large 60 per cent majority. Strong popular opposition to genetic engineering experiments has already driven the three big Basle-based chemical and pharmaceutical groups, Ciba-Geigy, Roche and Sandoz, to shift a significant portion of their research and development activities out of the country. However, neither side can take much comfort from Sunday's result. For one thing, it was preceded by a brutish campaign that shed little light on the troubling issues raised by the use of animals in scientific experiments and in the testing of products aimed at humans. For another, the animal rights campaigners already have another referendum proposal in the works, so there is little doubt that the Swiss are going to have to face the issues again. Animal rights activists have long appealed shamelessly to people's emotions in their campaigns, presenting heart-rending photographs of cuddly animals in pain. In this campaign, their opponents responded in kind with posters showing a person suffering from cancer or Aids, and punching home the message, 'We must not let him down'. There was almost no serious discussion of the potential for developing further alternatives to the use of animals in R&amp;D or of improving the delineation of limits and controls on the practice. The animal rights campaigners would argue that their proposed amendment to the Swiss constitution did attempt to set reasonable controls, but it was a sly text. It said that all use of animals should be forbidden unless it could be shown that an experiment would be of 'decisive significance for the preservation of human or animal life or the relief of considerable suffering.' It is, of course, in the nature of R&amp;D that the results of an experiment cannot be known in advance. The scientific community, led by the big pharmaceutical companies, stood on its record and on the lack of alternatives to the use of animals for some vital experiments. The companies claim a 50 per cent reduction in the use of animals in experiments since the mid 1970s. But how much credit is due to them and how much to the Swiss government which, goaded by animal rights activists, has cracked down on perceived excesses, is debatable. Nevertheless, it does seem that frivolous uses, such as in cosmetic testing, are on the way out, leaving only two hard core types of animal use. First, most basic biochemical experiments must be carried out on fresh tissue, and so there would seem to be no alternative to the large-scale use of mice - other than to curtail the experiments. Second, for testing new pharmaceutical products, there comes a point when a compound has to be tested on a live, complex organism so that all its actions can be discovered. In the area where only fools and knaves could comfortably provide firm direction, it is probably a good thing to have a mechanism for a fairly regular public review of current practice and thinking - even if the actual debate is less enlightening than one might hope for. Perhaps the Swiss have not lost their touch after all.</p>

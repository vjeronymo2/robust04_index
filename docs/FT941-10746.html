			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Rover, the cultural cost As someone involved in Anglo-Japanese cross-cultural training, I am appalled by the lack of sensitivity of Britain's captains of industry, politicians and the media with regard to the Japanese position in the disastrous affair of the BMW acquisition of Rover. The differences in business and cultural practices between Japan and the west are significant, and our training centre is evidence of the Japanese commitment to trying to understand the way in which we operate. This sensible business strategy is obviously unmatched by the British, who continue to operate with typical British arrogance and short-termism. From a Japanese perspective it is inconceivable that a 15-year relationship of mutual help and successful outcome, coupled with an 'in principle' or 'gentleman's' agreement, would be ignored. From British Aerospace's perspective, the Japanese negotiation and discussion making process, so different from ours, may have been misunderstood for lack of urgency and interest. The government, caught between the EU and a desire for Japanese inward investment, did nothing, despite having spent years showing off about British success in attracting Japanese funds. Lord Young chose instead to tell us we should be proud of being used as cheap labour by the Germans. Nobody is seriously discussing the appalling economic, political and diplomatic implications of what is probably a result of culture clash but will become an unforgettable cautionary tale in Japan.

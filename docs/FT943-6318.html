			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / A dose of OTC medicine for growth strategy: SmithKline Beecham's hyperactivity on the deals front Since April, when Mr Jan Leschly became chief executive of SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-US healthcare company, he has been suffering from hyperactivity. In May, he spent Dollars 2.3bn (Pounds 1.5bn) on Diversified Pharmaceutical Services, a US pharmacy benefit manager, to support his North American pharmaceuticals operations; earlier this month he offered to swap his vaccines and animal health businesses for assets from American Cyanamid before it was acquired by American Home Products; and yesterday, he splashed out a further Dollars 2.925bn on Sterling Health, Sterling Winthrop's over the counter (OTC) non-prescription medicines business. Mr Leschly, a former Wimbledon quarter-finalist, says all this activity is part of his aim to make SB the world's largest healthcare company. Yesterday's purchase goes some way to achieving that ambition. The deal, the largest ever OTC acquisition, doubles the size of SB's OTC operations and makes it the world's biggest maker of OTC medicines, outselling Johnson &amp; Johnson of the US. The combined group would have OTC sales of about Dollars 2bn. The move strengthen SB's presence in the OTC market, worth about Dollars 30bn a year and growing at a rate of about 6 per cent. The OTC sector is being driven by the desire of drugs groups to extend the product life of their medicines after the patents expire. They believe this can be achieved by switching their drugs to non-prescription status and then marketing them direct to the public. More than half of the US's 50 top-selling drugs are scheduled to lose protection over the next four years. The growing OTC trend is also being encouraged by cash-strapped governments because it switches the burden of payment to the patient. Having targeted the OTC market, Mr Leschly insists the acquisition of Sterling Health makes strategic sense in terms of both products and geography. 'Before this deal we just did not have critical mass. More than Dollars 700m of our Dollars 1bn sales were in just three markets - the US, the UK and Germany. Elsewhere we were just too weak,' he says. In contrast only 33 per cent of Sterling Health's activities are in the US. The company is the second largest OTC group in Italy and France, fourth in the UK and the market leader in Denmark and Portugal. The group is also the largest manufacturer in Latin America, where the market should reach Dollars 4.8bn by the end of the decade, according to IMS Global Services, the market research company. Sterling Health is among the top three OTC suppliers in the Asia-Pacific area, excluding Japan. The combined company would be market leader in Europe with annual sales of more than Pounds 200m and fourth in the US with sales above Pounds 600m. The international (rest of the world) business would total more than Pounds 300m. In terms of products, the acquisition gives SB significant positions in the three most important OTC categories: analgesics, cough and cold remedies, and gastrointestinal products. In analgesics, the largest segment, SB acquires Sterling's Panadol. This is sold in 64 countries and generated sales last year of Dollars 250m, making it one of the world's biggest OTC products. SB also gains Bayer Asprin in the US. The deal also gives the group a strong position in digestive remedies, the third most important OTC category. SB is in the process of launching an OTC version of its once top-selling pharmaceutical product, Tagamet. Mr Leschly says this should complement its existing Tums and Eno antacid remedies. Sterling controls the Phillips' Milk of Magnesia and the Andrews brands. Mr Leschly denies Tagamet could cannibalise the other digestive products. 'Tagamet is a completely different ball of wax from the others,' he insists. In the cough and cold market, where SB already has brands such as Contac and Night Nurse, it takes control of Sterling Health's Valda and some smaller products. Mr Hugh Collum, SB's finance director, believes the deal makes not only strategic, but also financial sense. Sterling Health had sales last year of Dollars 1bn and made operating profits of Dollars 162m. SB gains the business for about three times sales and 18.5 times earnings. That compares with Roche's 1991 acquisition of Nicholas Laboratories at more than four times sales and about 30 times earnings. However, the deal lumbers SB with substantial debt. Mr Collum says gearing, already at 60 per cent after the acquisition of Diversified, would rise as high as 300 per cent. However, interest cover would still be about 20 times, he stresses, and gearing should fall to less than 100 per cent by 1996. To achieve that, Mr Leschly is banking on cashflow, rationalisation and asset sales. 'But we will only sell businesses when this is strategically right.' The rationalisation will involve taking costs out of the combined OTC businesses. In addition, Mr Leschly intends to cut costs at the international and European pharmaceuticals operations. Yesterday, he announced a Pounds 500m charge, half to be spent this year, half next year. Additional costs could be taken out of the animal health business in 1995, he added Mr Leschly's hyperactivity appears incurable: he is not ruling out further deals. 'We are looking for opportunities in the pharmaceuticals industry. We won't be rushed, and we certainly won't buy things at the sort of prices we've seen in recent week's (American Home Product's Dollars 9.7bn acquisition of American Cyanamid), but we're definitely in the market.'

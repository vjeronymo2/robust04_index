			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Clinton urged to call summit: World Economic Forum at Davos A BOLD plan for global economic recovery, including a 20 per cent revaluation of the yen against the dollar and speedy conclusion of the stalled Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks was proposed yesterday by Mr Fred Bergsten, a prominent US economist and former American official. Mr Bergsten, addressing business leaders, ministers, officials and academics at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum, called on President Bill Clinton to take the initiative by summoning a special summit meeting of the Group of Seven leading industrial countries to tackle the world's economic problems. Such a meeting might, he suggested, be held after President Clinton had unveiled his domestic economic programme in late March or April, but certainly before the annual G7 summit, scheduled for July in Tokyo. 'The G7 is dead,' Mr Bergsten said. 'The world economy is entering its third year of virtual stagnation. All industrial countries are suffering from each other's weaknesses.' His proposed 'global growth strategy' included: A substantial extra Japanese fiscal stimulus. Managed appreciation of the yen by 20 per cent along the lines of the 1985 Plaza accord, in order to counteract the rapidly growing Japanese trade surplus. Fiscal tightening in Germany and interest rate cuts in all principal countries. Mr Bergsten's call met a dusty response, however, from senior western officials at the forum. Mr Horst Koehler, state secretary at the German Finance Ministry, agreed the need for joint economic action was strong, but emphasised that 'macroeconomic policy co-ordination can only be successful over time if each country solves its own problems'. On trade, Mr Bergsten and many others stressed the need for a quick resolution of the Uruguay Round, reinforced by this week's anti-dumping actions by the US against foreign steel makers. However, Mr Arthur Dunkel, secretary general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, gave a gloomy prognosis as to the chances of completing the package by the beginning of March, when the US administration must formally notify Congress of its intent to conclude an agreement. 'There is still a hell of a technical job to be done, not just by the US and EC but by all the others. What we need is a decision to conclude.' Mr Bergsten said that if a full Uruguay Round agreement could not be concluded before the expiry of US fast track authorisation on June 1, a mini package entrenching the agricultural pact and other significant agreements already reached should be signed.</p>

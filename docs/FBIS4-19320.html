			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Nicholas Watt, Ireland correspondent: "Dublin </F> Tries To Calm Unionists Fear Over Reynolds Plan"]    [Text] The Irish government tried yesterday to allay  Unionist fears after Albert Reynolds, the Prime Minister, had  outlined his vision for a "new and agreed Ireland" with 30  percent of government posts reserved for Ulster politicians.    A senior Irish government source said Mr Reynolds was merely  floating ideas when he told a Fianna Fail youth conference on  Saturday [16 April] that he would provide "far-reaching  guarantees" for Unionists in a united Ireland.    The source said: "The Taoiseach [Prime Minister] was pushing  his ideas up the flag pole to see how they would be received.  His proposals would be debated in the context of an overall  settlement."    Unionists reacted angrily after Mr Reynolds spelt out the  merits of Irish unity for Unionists in his speech in Malahide,  Co Dublin. He said it would boost the Irish economy as a whole  and would allow Unionists to take part in government.    "I personally would be prepared to provide a guaranteed 30  percent of places in an enlarged government, and throughout the  public sector, for as long as was necessary, to members of the  two communities in the north in proportion to their respective  populations," Mr Reynolds said. He added that a united Ireland  would be able to secure a better deal for Ulster farmers. He  even suggested that Irish society was more tolerant and liberal  than Northern Ireland.    Mr Reynolds tried to couch his proposals in language that  would not upset Unionists, and he said that a majority in  Northern Ireland would not be coerced into a united Ireland.    The government source said that Mr Reynolds knew Unionists  would initially dismiss his speech, but he believes there will  never be progress unless he takes risks. "Unionists now know  his starting position. He knows his ideas may have sounded  premature, but he is prepared to take risks. If he didn't  nothing would be done. Republicans have reached a road block on  whether to give up violence. While they ponder what to do Mr  Reynolds is not going to twiddle his thumbs."    Yesterday Unionists dismissed Mr Reynolds's proposals as  unrealistic and unacceptable. James Molyneaux, the leader of  the Ulster Unionists, said: "The greater number of people in  Northern Ireland are not orphans wandering about in barren  landscapes waiting for somebody to let them in. They are quite  happy, Protestant and Catholic alike, to remain within the  bigger unit of the United Kingdom and they bear no ill will  towards their southern neighbour."</p>

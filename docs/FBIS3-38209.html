			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "eli": "Ruehe: Envisaging German Missions </F> Abroad"]    [Text] Bonn -- On Wednesday [26 January], the defense  ministers of Britain, France, and Germany met in London for  confidential talks on the NATO reform and a strengthening of the  Western European Union (WEU). Defense circles emphasize that  this was the first trilateral meeting of its kind. They say  this meeting has shown that France wishes to move closer to  military integration with NATO. Britain, on the other hand,  seems to have changed its course in the Partnership for Peace  policy. Of all the NATO members, London to date had voiced the  strongest reservations against NATO's opening toward East Europe.    During the "informal meeting," Britain's Defense Minister  Malcolm Rifkind and his French and German counterparts, Francois  Leotard and Volker Ruehe, discussed ways of strengthening  European defense through the WEU, the defense arm of the  European Union. In this connection, the defense ministers  mainly discussed the Combined Joint Task Force. A resolution  adopted at the latest NATO summit provides for this force to be  positioned in Europe and its commando units to be such that they  can be taken out of NATO structures. Ruehe pointed out that no  structures running parallel to NATO must develop in this  connection.    British reports say that Germany was also asked about its  undecided approach to missions abroad. A decision on Bonn's  future role in this is particularly important because it is  linked with the part Germany plays in the task force, its  stationing, and the distribution of posts. Ruehe stressed that  German participation has to be envisaged. He said it is  impossible not to include Germany in the task forces.    Observers think that the reason Britain is stepping up  involvement in the WEU has something to do with its fear of a  German-French axis in Europe. France's Leotard, on the other  hand, sees the linking of WEU and NATO structures as an  opportunity to move his country closer to military integration  with the alliance. France seems to have come to the conclusion  that WEU structures can only be strengthened in cooperation with  NATO.    The ministers also discussed the Partnership for Peace  program, which provides for NATO's cautious opening toward the  East European states. Britain, the fiercest opponent of the  program prior to the NATO summit, seems to be embarking on a  different course now, not least because the United States has  clearly expressed its determination to include East Europe.  Ruehe will discuss this issue with his Polish counterpart Piotr  Kolodziejczyk today.</p>

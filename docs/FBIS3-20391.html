			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou will reshuffle the  government after the PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist Movement]  congress and before the European Parliament elections, to wage  the election battle with the "confidence" of a renewed  government. According to reliable sources, he believes some  correctional changes are necessary to give new impetus to the  sectors that are not functioning well and to deal with the  problem of lack of coordination within the government.    According to the same sources, the prime minister intends to  give a portfolio to Dhimitrios Tsovolas and replace Education  Minister Dhimitrios Fatouros.    He is also considering whether he should remove Alternate  Foreign Minister Theodhoros Pangalos during the shuffle or after  the expiration of the Greek European Union presidency in July.    The situation at the top of the National Economy Ministry  will remain unchanged unless Finance Minister Yeoryios  Yennimatas decides to move up to the government's vice  presidency or resign. In this case, his replacement will be  either Bhouttos, Vaitsos, or Pottakis.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cape Town June 9 SAPA -- The African National  Congress had made it clear in an investment guide in 1992 that  foreign investments in South Africa would not be expropriated,  President Nelson Mandela said on Thursday. Answering questions  at the World Economic Forum conference in Cape Town he said the  commitment of the government of the next five years to consensus  would ensure that it was "not likely for us to do anything that  will antagonise investors".    A poll last year had also shown that business leaders had  confidence in South Africa's future.    The government had no hesitation in saying the country today  had no free market economy. More than 80 per cent of shares on  the Johannesburg Stock Exchange belonged to five conglomerates.    The government was the "only people who are going to make  the  market work in the historic sense of the word".</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Finnish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin has,  during his visit to Finland, which started today, had talks  especially on the economic cooperation between Finland and  Russia. Chernomyrdin said that Russia is going to continue,  despite problems and setbacks, on the reform line it has chosen.  Our reporter Jukka Palmen has been following Viktor  Chernomyrdin's news conference.    [Palmen] Here at the State Banqueting Hall, or the Smolna of  Helsinki as it used to be called, the news conference of Prime  Minister Chernomyrdin has now taken about 30 minutes. The  matters raised have mainly been economic questions. This visit  seems to very strongly concentrate on economic questions. The  unceremonious character of the visit became clear in the  morning, when Prime Minister Chernomyrdin was received without  any official welcoming ceremonies, and he has during the whole  day had talks with Prime Minister Esko Aho and had lunch with  President Martti Ahtisaari in between the talks.    No significant news has come up yet today except that Russia  will cover part of its debt to Finland with arms deliveries.  How big these arms deliveries are is not quite clear yet.  According to Prime Minister Aho, the deliveries are so big that  they will cover the Russian debt on the clearing account of the  Bank of Finland.    Prime Minister Chernomyrdin also visited the Confederation  of  Finnish Industry and Employers and four fairly urgent projects  were taken up there; projects that Finnish industry would like  to get off the ground. These are the diesel engine factory in  St. Petersburg, the production of railway carriages, and the  Outokumpu mining company project to open mines on the Kola  Peninsula, among others. Nothing concrete was agreed on these  either.    Of foreign policy questions, the question of the Baltic  countries was taken up briefly at this news conference when a  Swedish reporter asked whether Russia will really impose  sanctions on the Baltic countries if it is of the opinion that  the human rights of the Russians are not secured in the Baltic  countries. Chernomyrdin denied all sanctions but said that the  human rights of Russians, like the human rights of everybody  else, must be secured in the Baltic countries. I am ending my  report here, now back to the studio in Pasila.</p>

			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Glaxo strong Pharmaceuticals group Glaxo jumped 14 to 665p ahead of interim figures tomorrow as several houses pointed out the yield benefits and US sellers stayed away. Hoare Govett reiterated its buy stance and its forecast of a 21 per cent hike in the dividend to 8.5p, in the middle of a one penny range. The house predicts interim profits of Pounds 970m. Lehman Brothers, the US house, stressed its preference for the stock over SmithKline Beecham, which fell 4 to 411p. Lehman cut its 1993 forecast for SmithKline to Pounds 1.180bn from Pounds 1.209bn and reduced earnings per share to 29.4p from 30.2p. It reduced its 1994 estimate by Pounds 90m to Pounds 1.255bn and earnings per share to 31.2p from 33.3p. Mr Ian Smith of Lehman said: 'This sector is focusing on yield as opposed to earnings growth and the two-point differential between SmithKline and Glaxo is starting to stand out.' However, Nomura argued that the market was ignoring the declining sales momentum of Zantac, Glaxo's anti-ulcer treatment which represented 44 per cent of sales in 1993. The strong market trend helped British Airways recover from an early retreat after several brokers downgraded full year profit expectations following third quarter figures. The shares initially eased 8 to 466p, before recovering to close a penny off at 473p, in trade of 10m, after the group revealed a threefold increase in profits to Pounds 65m. However, Mr Mike Stoddart at Charterhouse Tilney, who reduced his full year forecast by Pounds 25m to Pounds 300m said the figures were below his expectations, adding: 'The company continues to talk about excess capacity in the industry'. Strauss Turnbull reduced its figure by Pounds 45m to arrive at the same forecast. But Nikko Securities was said to have appreciated the figures and is believed to have upgraded. One of the property market's biggest bulls, agency broker James Capel, turned down the heat slightly as it took a number of the sector's most ebullient stocks off its buy list. Mr Andrew Causer at Capel said that certain stocks, such as MEPC, Brixton, British Land and Slough Estates, which in some cases have quadrupled in value, needed to pause for breath until rental growth rates in 1995-96 could be confidentially predicted. MEPC steadied at 514p, Slough slipped 2 to 288p, British Land 5 to 443p and Brixton 2 to 250p. Nervousness over the price of Brent crude led to weakness in oil shares. Investors were also holding themselves back in readiness for France's FFr35bn Elf Aquitaine privatisation. British Petroleum fell 3 1/2 to 366 1/2 p in spite of strong figures last week. However, BP said talk of a persistent sell-off of the shares in the US was overdone. Meanwhile, British Gas jumped 8 to 331p. Nomura told clients that the recent fall in the share price had pushed the yield premium against the market to an all-time high. Nomura remains negative but was suggesting that underweight investors 'might consider picking up stock'. The decline in domestic brewing stocks came to an abrupt halt as NatWest Securities decided that the sector was looking oversold. The most recent battering, on Monday, came after Courage reported a drop in profits. Scottish &amp; Newcastle, one of NatWest's favoured stocks, gained 7 to 522p, and Whitbread put on 13 to 547p. Standard Chartered rebounded 36 to 1301p after Swiss Bank pointed out that the share price had fallen 11.4 per cent from its recent peak. QVC Network's failed Dollars 10bn bid for Paramount in the US was said to have inspired gains in the UK leisure market on speculation that QVC will now look elsewhere for a multimedia target. Thorn EMI, buoyed also by good UK industry music figures, climbed 22 to 1105p, while Rank Organisation added 19 to 1076p. Forte put on 2 to 259p and traded a short 5m as NatWest Securities removed the stock from its short-term sell list. Doubts about the future of transport leasing group Tiphook surfaced after the group said it faced liquidation if the sale of its container division did not go ahead. The shares closed 9 down at 58p. Profit-taking in British Steel saw the shares close 3 lighter at 142 1/2 p, amid fears of a steep fine being imposed on the group by the European Commission. Volume was 14m. Speculative buying in Babcock International brought turnover of 13m as the shares improved 2 1/4 to 38 1/4 p. Wellcome was heavily traded with a block of 6.2m shares taken on at 639p and placed at 640p. Dealers said SG Warburg had carried out the business which represented a stake of just under 0.7 per cent. Wellcome's share price rose 5 to 655p. First-quarter figures from Hanson came in at the low end of expectations, but did no more than hold the share price down to 283 1/2 p, unchanged on the day. Turnover hit 13m. NatWest Securities maintained a full year forecast of Pounds 1bn after adjusting for the flotation of Hanson's US housebuilding business. Property minnow Jermyn Investment surged 102 to 285p amid reports of directors' share dealings. Other statistics, Page 33</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Seyfali Akhundov under the rubric "Document": </F> "The Entire Community Against Corruption"]    [Text] Fighting corruption shall be the duty of all  state and municipal organs, organizations, and institutions, of  all individuals empowered to perform state functions....    (From the draft of the Law on Fighting Corruption)    The draft Law on Corruption was one of the last documents  which the Supreme Soviet considered and approved in its time.  However, President Yeltsin did not sign it, referring it for  revision. According to Viktor Ilyukhin, chairman of the  Committee on Security of the lower chamber of the Russian  parliament, the committee has resuscitated the draft and made a  number of substantial revisions in it. Possible amendments to  the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, which does not  define precisely what should be considered corruption in Russia,  are being considered in parallel with the law. In Ilyukhin's  opinion, this evil has afflicted the state structures of Russia  from top to bottom.    The draft, hearings on which have already been held at a  joint meeting of two commissions of the State Duma--for  security, and for legislation and judicial reform--envisions  punishments of several kinds for unconscientious officials.  Being disciplined administratively is the lightest punishment  that a bribe-taker holding a state position can get away with.  This is followed by dismissal from his position with a  subsequent ban on working for state institutions for a certain  period of time. Criminal liability is envisioned for crimes in  office which have considerably damaged the interest of the state.    The chairman of the Committee on Security has no illusions  about the new law working to the fullest extent immediately  after its adoption by the parliament and confirmation by the  president of the Russian Federation. Like many others, the  document is threatened with falling victim to the atmosphere of  "legal nihilism" that reigns in the country.    Some deputies from the Russia's Choice faction oppose the  adoption of the Law on Fighting Corruption as such. In their  opinion, the law torpedoes the economic reform that is underway  in Russia.    Viktor Ilyukhin believes that the attitude of the president  of the Russian Federation toward the new draft law is being  formed under the influence of two legal schools,  "theoreticians"--who are represented by the Institute of State  and Law of the Russian Federation, and "practitioners"--the  Institute of the Russian Federation Procuracy, the Academy of  the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and others. Whether Yeltsin  will sign the document after it is approved and passed in the  Federation Council largely depends on who succeeds in  substantiating their position better--the "theoreticians" or the  "practitioners." In the opinion of the chairman of the Committee  on Security, there are quite a few people on the staff of the  president of Russia and in the government who are resisting the  appearance of the new law. An alternative draft of the law is  being developed in the recesses of the president's staff.  However, Ilyukhin believes that the Duma is outpacing the team  of the president. The presidential law is still at the  development stage, whereas that of the Duma is almost ready.</p>

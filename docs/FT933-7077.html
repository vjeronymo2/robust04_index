			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: British Rail British Rail's management seems wedded to the notion that the best way to raise net revenues at times of weak demand is to cut services and raise prices. Such an attitude comes naturally to a monopoly which believes it can shamelessly exploit a captive customer base. Even in Network SouthEast's commuterland, it is starting to look old-fashioned. Sooner or later a policy of charging more for less will lead inexorably to lower rather than higher revenues. If nothing else, private ownership of rail would surely see a more imaginative approach to revenue generation. Increased usage might even produce a lower unit cost, for all that expensive track and signalling infrastructure.</p>

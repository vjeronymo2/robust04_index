			<p>BFN     [Text] We have received the following letter from 'Abd-al-  Rahim Malluh, member of the Political Bureau of the Popular  Front for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP], reacting to a news  report published under the headline "Weapons Seized in Habash's  Car." The text of the letter follows:    Mr. Ra'id Salihah, Editor of AL-BILAD newspaper,    Greetings:    Issue Number 61, dated 9 March, 1994, of AL-BILAD published  the following in the center of the front page, under the  headline "Weapons Seized in Habash's Car:"    "The Jordanian version says that during Habash's recent  visit  to Jordan, his car was searched and found to contain  miscellaneous weapons and silencers. Meanwhile, security  agencies have begun stepping up surveillance at Jordan's border  points to thwart any gun-smuggling attempts, especially after  the two movie theater bombings." [see item JN0803210694 in 15  March Terrorism Report]    This report carried by your newspaper is baseless and only  seeks to discredit comrade Secretary General George Habash.    Such rumors are calculated to harm Palestinian-Jordanian  relations and to resurrect the events of the past [the  September, 1970 clashes that pitted Palestinian guerrillas  against the Jordanian military]. [passage omitted]    The charge that George Habash sought to smuggle weapons is  absolutely baseless, and state agencies in Jordan can confirm  this.    Dr. Habash is a sufficiently credible and self-respecting  person not to abuse the special privileges offered him by the  state authorities during his visits to compromise the country's  security and stability.    We cannot make sense out of the connection you made between  the fabricated report and the movie theater bombings and the  subsequent measures taken by the Jordanian authorities unless  the aim is to discredit the PFLP, and George Habash in  particular, and the factions of the Palestinian revolution in  general.    We have consistently come out against any actions designed  to  undermine Jordan's security, including the barbaric bombings of  the movie houses.    For the record, on his last visit here on 23 February, 1994,  Dr. Habash was not subjected to any searches at the border, and  was treated with all the respect due a national patriot.    [Signed] 'Abd-al-Rahim Malluh, PFLP Political Bureau member</p>

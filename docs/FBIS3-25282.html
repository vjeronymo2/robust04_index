In a statement released here on Monday, the International  Federation of the Red Cross and the German Red Cross  (Federation/GRC) said that after the first attack, they had  decided to pull out all NGO expatriates in the region, except  the Federation's delegate and a respresentative of the  International Medical Corps (IMC).    But the IMC and the Federation/GRC also pulled out the two  on  February 12 after another attack was aimed at the residence  where they were staying.    Shortly before their departure on Saturday, the head of  Federation Somalia delegation in Nairobi was informed by IMC  through their Nairobi representative that the head of  Federation/GRC sub-delegation in Beledweyne was also being held  hostage and that his life was being threatened.    But he was released after frantic efforts by Federation/GRC  and the Somali Red Crescent Society, and has now been flown to  Nairobi.</p>

			<p><P> April 23, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: AUERBACH DROVE HIM OUT OF TOWN  </P> <P> It was tough year for Bill Fitch in New Jersey, but the coach of the Nets said  he's a survivor.  </P> <P> When the Nets last played in Boston, Fitch recalled his years as coach of the  Celtics.  </P> <P> "Four years of cigar smoke nine hours a day, and I'm alive," he told the  Providence Journal.  </P> <P> "And I rode around this town for four years with one of the worst drivers in  the world, and I survived."  </P> <P> The cigar smoker, obviously, was Red Auerbach, president of the Celtics. But  who was the driver?  </P> <P> "Auerbach!" Fitch said. "Why, the kamikaze pilots in World War II took lessons  from him."  </P> <P> Today's quiz: Q. When Atlanta Brave Manager Russ Nixon said, "This is by far  the best team I've ever managed," how is it that the city didn't applaud?  </P> <P> A. Because Nixon has managed four teams, two at Cincinnati, two at Atlanta, and  all four finished last.  </P> <P> Trivia time: When Tom Niedenfuer delivered the fatal pitch to Jack Clark, what  was the count?  </P> <P> Would-you-believe-it Dept.: Tracy Ringolsby of the Dallas Morning News came up  with this statistic: The last four opening-game starters for the Chicago White  Sox were traded before the season ended.  </P> <P> Tom Seaver (1986) went to Boston, Richard Dotson (1987) to the New York  Yankees, Ricky Horton (1988) to the Dodgers, and Jerry Reuss (1989) to  Milwaukee.  </P> <P> This year's opening-game starter was Melido Perez.  </P> <P> Stop the presses: From the Akron Beacon Journal: "The Atlanta Hawks suspended  mascot Harry the Hawk for a game when he dumped water on some fans who were  cheering for Charlotte. Meanwhile, in Charlotte, Hugo the Hornet quit in a  dispute with owner George Shinn."  </P> <P> Now-it-can-be-told Dept.: From Pittsburgh Pirate outfielder John Cangelosi,  recalling his struggle to make the club in spring training: "I was signing  autographs, and some guy said, 'If you don't make the team, can I have your  cap?' That's the coldest thing I've ever heard."  </P> <P> No tears: From Oakland Athletic pitcher Dave Stewart, applauding the city's  decision to pull out of the Raider deal: "I'm a die-hard Raider fan, don't get  me wrong, but I remember 1982, when Al Davis packed up shop and took off. Let  him go to Sacramento or even Baltimore."  </P> <P> Making his mark: Gary Player, on U.S. Amateur golf champion Chris Patton, who  weighs over 300 pounds: "That's the only player I ever saw who takes a divot  just standing there."  </P> <P> Trivia answer: It was the first pitch.  </P> <P> Quotebook: Reliever Dan Quisenberry, on his contract with the San Francisco  Giants: "It has options through the year 2020 or until the last 'Rocky' movie  is made."

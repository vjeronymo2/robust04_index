			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / Management: Need to keep the change machine under control There could hardly be a clearer contrast between a lame management and a sprightly one than the ways in which Eastman Kodak and ABB are grasping the cactus of transformational change. Each announced last week that it is cutting more jobs: Kodak 10,000, ABB 7,000. But there any resemblance ends. Kodak's action is belated and defensive, as it struggles to save its crumbling world after decades of inertia in the face of surging competitive pressure. ABB's move is timely and aggressive: it will help it retain the lead it seized five years ago in remoulding its global sector, raising its industry's productivity standards, and accelerating its own business and management processes. This last objective will also be served by the streamlining of its international organisation which was unveiled this week. The two companies' attitudes to the management of change are coincidentally analogous to the nature of their core businesses: on the one hand, a specialist in static images, on the other a company which makes flywheels of power. To Kodak, change has been a stop-start series of isolated, intermittent initiatives. But to ABB, since its creation in 1988 out of sprightly Asea and lumbering Brown Boveri, change has been a continuously evolving process which companies must anticipate and shape before their rivals do. There are no prizes for guessing which approach is more necessary or effective in today's business climate. Companies of all shapes, sizes and nationalities may, like Kodak, yearn for the comfortable days when change could be an intermittent process, in which one project or initiative could be completed before the next began. But all sorts of radical changes now need to be initiated in quick succession, and run either in parallel or as an integrated whole. This point is brought home with a bang by a survey on 'change management' which is about to be published by KPMG Management Consulting, an arm of KPMG Peat Marwick*. Most of its corporate respondents are running four or more different types of cross-functional change programmes. With ample justification, KPMG doubts whether many of them are being properly integrated. The survey, of top executives in 250 medium-sized and large British companies, comes up with mixed conclusions. On the plus side, the majority of respondents (85 per cent) intend to persevere over the next three years with most of the fundamental change programmes that they are already running, in such areas as total quality management, customer care, culture change and empowerment. They do not plan to dump or downgrade these existing initiatives in favour of the latest type of radical programme to hit the scene, business process redesign (or re-engineering). The survey was carried out before re-engineering hit the headlines in Europe early this summer, but an updated mini-poll a month ago shows TQM and customer care still retaining their popularity in spite of widespread problems with TQM and a surge in plans to introduce re-engineering. That is good news for those who feared that, as in the US, re-engineering would become the sudden, all-consuming flavour of the year. The US mania contrasts with the good sense of ABB, which has run co-ordinated programmes on TQM, 'customer focus' (as it calls it), business process redesign, culture change and employee empowerment almost since its formation and expects them to continue indefinitely. Thanks to ABB's careful integration of its programmes, and the restless, change-minded culture which it has bred, it has suffered less than other companies from 'change fatigue'. This is almost certainly not the case for many of the companies in KPMG's sample - over a quarter of the total - which claim to have undertaken 10 or more change initiatives in the last three years. KPMG is remarkably mild about the severe problems that change fatigue can cause. It warns only of the need to co-ordinate and prioritise 'so that the change machine does not get out of control'. A more forceful and appropriate comment was made recently by the rival Boston Consulting Group. Warning of 'the danger of doing too much', BCG reported that many large US companies now had up to 15 'process improvement' initiatives under way, but that these seldom added up to a coherent programme. In such cases, warned BCG, employees become so overloaded that they gravitate towards easily resolvable problems, and avoid the big ones. Tough cross-functional issues are ignored, and sacred cows continue to fatten. General managers grow increasingly sceptical, failing to see a link between all the improvement programmes and the bottom line. On the last point, KPMG lets its gentlemanly stance slip a bit. It scratches its head over the fact that only 31 per cent of its respondents thought their programmes were 'very effective', and is rightly concerned that managers identified few tangible gauges of effectiveness. As it suggests, all sorts of measures should be carried out periodically, of staff attitudes, customer perceptions, and operational efficiency. Plus, of course wherever it can be identified, the impact of each programme on the 'bottom line'. The lesson of all this is not that companies should drop change programmes which have turned tricky, but that they should put more effort into preparing, implementing and co-ordinating them - especially as events twist and turn, as they always will. If companies cannot face that prospect, they will land themselves in the same mire as Kodak. * From Dawn Austwick, KPMG. Fax (UK) 071-832-8888.</p>

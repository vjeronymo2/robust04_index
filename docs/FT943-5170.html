			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Move to break ceasefire deadlock: Mayhew says UK would accept IRA statement of intent to end violence for good The British government made a new attempt yesterday to break the deadlock over the wording of last week's IRA ceasefire declaration by inviting republican leaders to state unequivocally their intention to end the violence for good. Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said: 'We are not insisting on a particular form of words. We just need to have an unequivocal assertion that they intend it should be over for good.' Sir Patrick's remarks appeared to indicate that a response based on republican intentions rather than specific wordings could be sufficient to open the door to exploratory talks with Sinn Fein. Referring to the British and Irish governments' differing interpretations of the IRA statements to date, he said he did not doubt Dublin's sincerity in accepting that the IRA had ended its campaign, but 'we have to be satisfied from what these people say themselves about their own intentions'. Sir Patrick met Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, last night at Hillsborough, the Northern Ireland secretary's official residence. The meeting was an attempt to agree a common response to the ceasefire and to discuss progress on a framework document on new constitutional arrangements for the province, due to be tabled at inter-party talks later this year. After the meeting, Sir Patrick said: 'Both of us share the common hope of seeing . . . a permanent end to violence.' However, the two ministers appeared to be no closer to agreeing on whether the IRA ceasefire was already a permanent cessation of violence. Mr Spring said: 'There is a desire by the republicans to be part of the democratic process . . . I would hope we can move on from here - that there will be no more violence from the republican side in Northern Ireland, and what is expected now is that there will be a reciprocation from the loyalist side.' He added: 'I personally believe that we can overcome any differences that have arisen.' Downing Street officials yesterday played down suggestions that Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader, was about to receive permission from the US authorities to make a tour of American cities. Leading Sinn Fein officials confirmed that they were examining the possibility of a visit to the US by Mr Adams and other senior republicans, including Mr Martin McGuinness, a member of Sinn Fein's executive. A Downing Street spokesman said the US government had given no formal indication to London that it was prepared to give visas to Sinn Fein officials. However, the spokesman made clear that Mr John Major, the prime minister, would prefer the US to refrain from granting Mr Adams a visa until Sinn Fein and the IRA had stated that the ceasefire would be permanent. Reacting to Sir Patrick's demands for a statement on republican intentions, Mr Tom Hartley, Sinn Fein's national chairman, complained the British were 'piddling about'. He said: 'The Irish government are taking the process forward. Will the British government not run with it. They're making the problem worse by just prevaricating.' Last night, speculation continued that the Ulster Volunteer Force, one of the main loyalist paramilitary groupings, might call its own ceasefire. Mr Chris Hudson, a Dublin trade union official who held talks with UVF representatives last week, said that among unionists 'there was definitely cautious optimism . . . that they were beginning to feel convinced there was no sell-out, no deals done, no secret agenda'.

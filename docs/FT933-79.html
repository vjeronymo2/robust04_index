			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Government Bonds: Gilts recover losses after disappointing auction UK GILTS ended a volatile day slightly higher, recovering from a disappointing gilts auction. The auction of Pounds 3.25bn of 6 3/4 per cent stock due 2004 was covered just 1.18 times - compared with expectations of a 1.5 to 1.7 ratio - and had a three basis points tail, the difference between the average and highest accepted yield. The low cover was put down to a lack of foreign buying in the light of sterling's current weakness, as well as the gilt market's recent rally, which left most investors reluctant to chase prices higher. Prices dropped nearly half a point on the auction result, but soon rebounded on heavy demand for the new stock. 'We were flooded with buying inquiries,' said one trader. 'There was a lot of pent-up foreign demand at lower levels.' Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist at S. G. Warburg, said the low cover was 'largely a reflection of the market getting more sophisticated and more experienced in doing auctions.' Moreover, he points out that four of the last eight auctions saw bid-to-cover ratios of between one and 1 1/4 times. GERMAN government bonds recouped early weakness and firmed in the afternoon on international buying spurred by the D-Mark's strength. Moreover, futures dealers tried to push the December bund contract through its historical high at 99.24, though it peaked short of that at 99.17. Technical factors are expected to drive bunds further today. The market's bullish mood was temporarily dented by the Bundesbank's latest securities repurchase agreements, which left repo rates unchanged at 6.70 per cent. Many traders had hoped that the rate on the one-month repo might ease as it was offered at variable rates, but it matched the 6.70 per cent rate for two-week funds, reflecting money-market tightness and the Bundesbank's reluctance to signal a resumption in easing, traders said. While sentiment remains strong, some warn that bunds could come in for a correction when investors focus on the issue calendar for the next three months, with some DM50bn of supply in store. Bunds are also expected to remain vulnerable to any renewed flare-ups in Russia. DUTCH bonds outperformed bunds, with the Dutch 10-year benchmark yielding 19 basis points less that its German counterpart, compared with 16 basis points on Tuesday. FRENCH government bonds tracked bunds on the way up but ended the day slightly lower on late profit-taking after three days of gains. The notional bond future on the Matif closed at 123.76, down 0.06 point on the day. The Bundesbank's decision to leave its repo rates unchanged at 6.70 per cent dampened hopes of a rate cut at today's Bank of France repos. But talk of near-term easing continued, with traders now focusing on Monday's repo. JAPANESE government bonds slipped on profit-taking after the recent rally. The December JGB future ended at 112.73, down 0.11 points on the day. US Treasury prices fell sharply at the long end of the maturity range yesterday in the wake of higher oil prices. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  3/4 at 103 9/16 yielding 5.987 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was down  1/16 at 100 1/32 , to yield 3.842 per cent. Trading opened in subdued fashion, with no lead from overseas markets. Analysts said investors and traders were mostly staying on the sidelines, awaiting the economic data due to be released later in the week, including August personal income and spending figures, the August leading indicators and the September purchasing managers' index. Prices held their ground until early afternoon, when selling began to push the long end lower. Analysts said the declines were a knee-jerk response to higher oil prices, and may also have been prompted by rumours of a big increase in the Conference Board's help-wanted index.</p>

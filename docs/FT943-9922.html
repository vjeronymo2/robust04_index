			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / Graduate salaries increase by smallest amount on record The average salary being offered to new university graduates rose by only 1.1 per cent this year, the smallest increase since records began in 1981, according to a report published today. The finding, by the Higher Education Careers Services Unit, which represents university vice-chancellors and principals, indicates the mean starting salary in February this year, was Pounds 12,647, up from Pounds 12,505 a year earlier. This rise, calculated from 908 vacancies advertised to university career services, was lower than increases in both the retail prices index (2.4 per cent) and average earnings (3.5 per cent) over the same period. Between 1981 and 1990, average starting salaries for graduates of all disciplines had increased above the rate of inflation. But strong candidates are still able to command inflation-beating salaries. The Association of Graduate Recruiters, which represents the 300 largest university recruiters, said its members had raised starting salaries by an average of 3.8 per cent. Mr Roly Cockman, the association's secretary, said yesterday: 'Even in today's market, high fliers have the luxury of choice. Big companies will pay Pounds 17,000 or Pounds 18,000 for a new graduate they really want.' The outlook is more bleak, however, for the majority of graduates. Today's report says: 'Since September, salary levels have been relatively stagnant as employers have cautiously resumed recruitment following the recession and have taken advantage of the large pool of graduates seeking jobs to keep wage bills low.' Mr Colin Lawton, the unit's statistical assistant, said: 'It's a self-feeding process. A lot of companies are alerted when they find graduates knocking on their doors or writing speculative letters.' An increase in the influence of smaller employers in a market dominated, before the recession, by large companies recruiting through the university 'milk round', was the main factor depressing salaries. The total number of advertised vacancies for graduates rose 5 per cent on last year, while the average number of vacancies offered by each company fell, reflecting increased recruitment by smaller companies. Many were recruiting graduates to jobs which might previously have been filled by school leavers, Mr Lawton said.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> At the close of the hearing Administrative Law Judge  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> John M. Vittone established a 60-day post hearing comment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period, until October 22, 1990, for the submission of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional information and data supplementing the testimony  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided at the hearing. The post-hearing comment period  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was followed by another 30 days, until November 21, 1990,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for hearing participants to submit final briefs, analyses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and summations. OSHA received 12 comments during the post- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hearing comment period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA has considered all evidence, comments and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testimony entered into the rulemaking record and presented  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at the public hearing in developing this final standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Basis for Agency Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Hazards <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The safety hazards present in the logging industry are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> well-known, <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  and there is no dispute among participants in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this rulemaking that logging is a high hazard industry (Ex.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2&hyph;1 through 2&hyph;10, 2&hyph;30, 5&hyph;18, 38B, 38C). The tools and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment which logging employees use or operate, such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chain saws, axes and tractors, pose hazards wherever they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are utilized in industry. As logging employees use their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tools and equipment, they are dealing with massive weights  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and irresistible momentum of falling, rolling, and sliding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> trees and logs. The hazards are even more acute when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dangerous environmental conditions are factored in, such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> uneven, unstable or rough terrain; inclement weather  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including rain, snow, lightning, winds, and extreme cold;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remote and isolated work sites where health care facilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are not immediately accessible. The combination of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hazards present a significant risk to employees working in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> logging operations throughout the country, regardless of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> type of timber being logged, where it is logged or the end  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use of the wood.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has identified a number of health hazards that are also present in the logging industry (Ex. 5&hyph;42). According to NIOSH, 20 to 50 percent of employees in felling operations may be affected by hand-arm vibration syndrome. Logging employees are also exposed to chain-saw exhaust, wood dust, tree fungi and bacteria. However, NIOSH has said that at this time there is insufficient data to project the magnitude of risk for some of these potential health hazards. The final rule on logging addresses health hazards, but only in certain specific ways (e.g., safety and health meetings). However, for those health hazards not specifically addressed in the logging final rule, other sections of Part 1910 apply. For example, occupational noise exposure is addressed by 29 CFR 1910.95. A permissible exposure limit for occupational exposure to wood dust is contained in 29 CFR 1910.1000. OSHA notes that hand-arm vibration, manual lifting and other risk factors associated with musculoskeletal disorders are being addressed in OSHA's rulemaking on ergonomic safety and health management. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There is also no dispute that these hazards and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resulting injuries and fatalities are severe and are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limited to the pulpwood sector of the industry (Ex. 2&hyph;1, 5&hyph;6, 5&hyph;10, 5&hyph;17, 5&hyph;18, 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;36, 5&hyph;42, 5&hyph;46, 5&hyph;48, 5&hyph;49, 5&hyph;54, 5&hyph;61, 5&hyph;65). The 1992 Census of Fatal Occupational  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Injuries, a public report compiled by the Bureau of Labor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Statistics (BLS), indicated there were 158 fatalities in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> logging industry, which amounts to a 2 in 1,000 risk of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> death each year. The National Institute for Occupational  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Safety and Health (NIOSH) estimates that there are 16,500  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compensable injuries each year in the logging industry (Ex.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 37). This amounts to an incidence rate of 1 in every 5  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> loggers. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (USDA), the accident rate in the logging industry has pushed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> workers' compensation insurance to 40 percent of payroll  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs (Ex. 5&hyph;18). The USDA estimates that this now amounts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to $90 million annually in the Pacific Northwest Region  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alone. According to a study conducted by the Bureau of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Labor Statistics (BLS), as least 47 percent of all injuries  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reported occurred in non-pulpwood logging operations (Ex. 2&hyph;1). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The following discussion of the accident and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> injury data shows that injury incidence rate for the logging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industry is among the highest industry incidence rates in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the country.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Accident, Injury, and Other Data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OSHA looked at several data sources to identify and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> characterize the degree of risk faced by employees in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> logging industry. The data show that the logging industry  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has one of the highest injury incidence rates. For example,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the most recent injury incidence rate for the logging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industry (15.6) compiled by the BLS is almost double the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incidence rate for the combined private sector (7.9). The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> logging incidence rate was also well above the incidence  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rate for the manufacturing sector (11.2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To assess the level of risk in logging operations, OSHA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relied primarily on the following data sources. These data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sources are described and discussed below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

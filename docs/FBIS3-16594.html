			<p>Language: <F P=105> Azeri </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Qulu Meherremov] </F>   [Text] The mass media have described the meeting between  the chairmen of the parliaments of Azerbaijan and Armenia as an  important development in the effort to establish peace between  the two republics. First, I wish to comment on the military and  political factors that have created that viewpoint and paved the  way for a better atmosphere in the region. It seems that  Armenia's effort to deploy reinforcements at the front lines  after losing many men in Azerbaijan's counterattacks during the  past two months, the strengthening opposition in that republic  against the war, and the decrease in the foreign aid Yerevan has  received have undermined Armenia's plans to find a military  solution to the dispute. Meanwhile, the intensified activity in  Azerbaijan's foreign policy, the relations established between  Azerbaijan and several countries that have supported Armenia,  and the strengthening possibility that the recent political  initiatives in the world on Abkhaziya and Bosnia may be  broadened to cover the dispute in the Caucasus can be regarded  as one of the reasons that has prompted the chairman of  Armenia's parliament to urge his counterpart in Azerbaijan to  agree to hold talks.    Of course, Russia's anxiety in its foreign policy on what  Armenia's situation will be in the battlefields and the  Transcaucasus in general if the inclination in the world for an  agreement strengthens has had a significant bearing on the  meeting of the two officials.    What is the difference between the talks held by the  chairmen  of the two parliaments and the meeting the deputy chairmen of  the parliaments of Azerbaijan and Armenia held through Russia's  mediation in 1993? The political nature of the talks clarifies  that matter. It is true that Azerbaijan's anxiety and  conviction that Armenia may resort to deceitful activities is  justified. However, the fact that the meeting between the two  chairmen has been realized as a result of that republic's  initiative has, in one way or another, clarified the question as  to which country has lost its potential in maintaining the war.    Meanwhile, the talks and the principles and conditions that  were agreed on, and which were also discussed during the  meeting, have indicated Armenia's new political inclinations in  its approach on the war in Karabakh, which was kindled by that  republic. If that meeting has been the outcome of a sincere  approach in Armenia's diplomacy, an approach that can hardly be  expected from that republic, then it can be regarded as an  indication that Yerevan may make an effort to contribute toward  the solution of the problem. Obviously, holding high-level talks  between Azerbaijan and Armenia will be possible if, as the  chairmen of the two parliaments have agreed, a strong guarantee  is given for the withdrawal of the Armenian Armed Forces from  the occupied territories in Azerbaijan. The high-level talks  will also facilitate the realization of the other measures that  the two chairmen have agreed on.    Naturally, the intensive talks with Armenia will expose the  claims made by the Armenians in Karabakh, regardless of the  effort that has been made to present them as a side to the  problem. They will also facilitate the realization of the  conditions the chairmen of the two parliaments have agreed on,  reactivate the UN resolutions on the dispute, and pave the way  for the return of hundreds of thousands of people to their homes.    Undoubtedly, one of the important tasks of Azerbaijan's  diplomats is to take political and legal measures on the  hope-inspiring provisions of the agreement between the two  sides, which are still on paper.</p>

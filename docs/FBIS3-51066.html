Rattazzi said that the jump in the figures since 1990, when  the airline began operations in Cuba by bringing 2,360  passengers here, is the most eloquent expression of the  satisfactory results of its efforts. In 1991, Air Europe brought  15,975 travelers to Cuba, and in 1992 the figure increased to  29,988.    Rattazzi said the number of Italian tourists traveling to  Cuba is growing by leaps and bounds, and he added that, in turn,  Air Europe expects to bring some 120,000 tourists to Cuba in  1995. This, he added, is more than 10 percent of the 1 million  tourists Cuba wants to attract.    Rattazzi pointed out that Air Europe has five flights per  week and currently travels to three Cuban tourist locations:  Havana, Varadero, and Ciego de Avila.    Rattazzi added that Air Europe works with 10 Italian tour  operators and is working for the first time with the Going  company, which he described as a serious firm that will have  great success in Cuba.</p>

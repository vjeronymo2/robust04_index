He is willing to help stop the bloodshed involving the  police and the Islamic organizations and the operations against  tourism in return for improving the treatment of inmates and  releasing a number of the detained [Islamic] leaders.    Information affirms that the security sections have  described  the offer as an individual initiative not worth pursuing,  particularly after the Islamic Group has announced that al-Zumur  has joined its ranks and relinquished his leadership of one  faction of the al-Jihad Organization.</p>

			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Talks on Hong Kong airport to resume TALKS between Britain and China on Hong Kong's proposed HKDollars 100bn (Pounds 7.5bn) international airport are to resume in Peking next Saturday nearly a month after a deadlock over the degree of control China should have over the project. No new initiative has emerged for the talks, and British officials say the UK and Hong Kong governments are not prepared to change their basic offer of consultation. They hope China will be prepared to soften its demand for a virtual right of veto, which the UK rejects. This would open the way for talks on details of consultation and project financing. China has been criticising the size and cost of the project for about a year. It has also been demanding a big say over the planning and execution in the run-up to 1997, when it regains sovereignty over Hong Kong. Mr Douglas Hurd, British foreign secretary, warned at the start of last month's talks that the project might be shelved if the political price of the control being demanded by China was too great. That possibility will be considered if next week's talks do not succeed, although at that stage Hong Kong's private sector might propose an alternative. Although China has not indicated any definite willingness to compromise, British diplomats say there have been some signs that it wants to clear the way for the airport to go ahead. It could then have separate discussions on its demands for increased consultation, verging on control, over a wide range of government issues in the run up to 1997. Britain said last night the talks would end after five days on May 22. This has been arranged to fit in with other commitments of Mr Andrew Burns, a senior diplomat from London who will lead the British team. But it serves the dual purpose of demonstrating that the UK is not prepared for extended talks if China refuses to compromise. Hong Kong legislators warned last night that they were not prepared to sanction finance for the construction of new accommodation for Vietnamese boat-people. The warning, made by the security committee of the executive and legislative councils, reflects concern about a sharp increase in the number of Vietnamese arriving in the colony. Mr Kwan Cheong Yiu, a 58-year-old broker who runs Golden Harvest Stock Investment, was yesterday elected senior vice chairman of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange council. He succeeds Mr Philip Wong, who resigned this week after a row with the government and the Securities and Futures Commission involving stock exchange reforms. Mr Kwan now becomes a front runner to succeed Sir QW Li, chairman, who is to retire in October.</p>

			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / International Company News: O&amp;Y wins time on US development OLYMPIA &amp; York has won an eight-month breathing space to renew its participation in the vast Yerba Buena property development in San Francisco, in exchange for giving up claims to the USDollars 26m it has already paid towards the project. An official of the San Francisco Redevelopment Authority said yesterday O&amp;Y has been given until the end of February 1993 to find an investor willing to pay amounts owing for the purchase of the land. The ailing Toronto-based developer last week failed to make a Dollars 2m payment. Under the original agreement with San Francisco, it would have forfeited all rights to develop the site into a sprawling office and entertainment centre. O&amp;Y was seeking an equity partner for Yerba Buena even before its liquidity crisis surfaced in February. The redevelopment authority official said the agreement put O&amp;Y in the position of marketing the project on behalf of the agency. In return, O&amp;Y has agreed to terminate its original contract with San Francisco and to release it from any future claims. This means that the agency will stay outside any bankruptcy proceedings O&amp;Y may file for its US business. So far, only its Canadian and UK operations are under the protection of bankruptcy courts. Bramalea, the ailing Canadian property developer controlled by Toronto's Bronfman family, will reduce its CDollars 4.8bn debt by CDollars 106m as a result of selling two shopping centres and 11 industrial properties. The shopping centres have been bought by Trizec, Bramalea's parent company. Trizec has taken measures in recent months to support Bramalea, including an equity infusion and purchases of other properties. Bramalea is in debt-restructuring talks with banks and other creditors. It missed a CDollars 5m interest payment on a debenture last week.</p>

Dr. Vojislav Seselj asked the members of  the Serbian Radical Party [SRS] and its sympathizers, who  gathered to hail their leader on Saturday evening. To support  his claim that there are no obstacles for him in "Serbian  Montenegro," the leader of the Serbian Radicals quoted his visit  to Plav, which is mainly inhabited by Muslims. "I strolled  through Plav yesterday, and nobody dared utter a word," boasted  Seselj who was received in the Budo Tomovic youth hall in  Podgorica with chants Serbia! Serbia! and well-known Chetnik  songs (Who is the second, I am the first to drink Turkish blood).    Seselj spoke mostly about the progress that has been made in  the creation of a greater Serbia, calling on the Muslims and the  Croats in the Republic of Croatia to "accept the peace on the  front lines as this is the most fair. If they do not want this,  the Serbs will conquer even those territories that they lost  because of the betrayal by the former Yugoslav Peoples' Army."  For this reason, the Serbs have lost Dubrovnik, Zadar, Sibenik,  Karlovac, Virovitica, and Osijek ("all Serbian towns"), however,  "one must be realistic" now and form a unified Serbian state  with one parliament and one president on the territories that  the Serbs "have managed to liberate."    "The SRS is a sword hanging over the heads of enemies of the  Serbs," Seselj stated and added that "the Muslims in Sandzak are  preparing for an uprising," however "let them, as several tens  of thousands of SRS members and the Serbian Chetnik movement  members are ready to go to these territories at any moment to  prevent the fragmentation of the Serbian lands." The revenge  will be bloody and there will be no mercy, Seselj added.    Dr. Seselj also reviewed the efforts of individual  Montenegrin parties (the Liberal Alliance of Montenegro and the  Social Democratic Party) to separate Montenegro from the Serbian  lands, which he described as "the betrayal of Serbianhood by  foreign mercenaries," who would not have entered the Assembly  had the Albanians, the Muslims and the Catholics in Boka  Kotorska not voted for them.</p>

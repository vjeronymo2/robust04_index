			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Survey of Aluminium (5): Old cans for new - Recycling / The use of reclaimed cans as a raw material 'GIVE ME a girl at an impressionable age, and she is mine for life,' says the eponymous teacher in Muriel Spark's novel The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie. This is certainly the hope of the Aluminium Can Recycling Association (Acra), which over the past three years has set about educating the UK public about the wonders of the aluminium can. This year surveys show that 53 per cent of the population aged between seven and 14 say they recycle their cans, compared with only 30 per cent of adults. Marketing campaigns, the setting up of 350 recycling centres, collection points at more than 1,000 supermarkets and high profile campaigns on children's television have succeeded in giving aluminium a 'green' image. Schools and charities have caught on to the fund raising possibilities. Aluminium also appears to be getting the upper hand in its battle with steel, which is after all just as recyclable. But aluminium's high intrinsic value more than covers the cost of separating it out before it enters the waste stream. Steel is more cheaply recovered by waving a magnet over refuse. Mr Francois Pruvost of Pechiney told an international aluminium conference in Oslo last month that during the last three years about 60 per cent of newly built canning lines in Europe are using aluminium as the raw material versus 40 per cent for steel. 'We expect the aluminium share of the market to progressively reach 65 to 70 per cent towards the end of the century,' he said. In the UK itself the decision by Coca-Cola to convert its canning lines to aluminium will largely contribute to the metal taking 72 per cent of the market in 1993, compared with only 40 per cent in 1989. Mr Pruvost pointed out to the conference that aluminium could not afford to rest on its laurels. 'Packaging is 10 times more important for aluminium than for steel and the two piece beverage can is 160 times more important for aluminium than for steel. Research and development efforts in packaging and cans are therefore given a much higher priority in the aluminium industry than in the steel industry and this also makes me optimistic about the future.' Acra feels that it is doing well in the UK, the biggest market for canned beverages in Europe, with per capita consumption of about 125 cans. This year out of a total beverage can consumption of 7.2bn, aluminium accounted for 4.3bn cans; next year the metal's market share is expected to be 5.4bn cans from a total of 7.4bn. The association is aiming to meet the European aluminium industry's target of recycling 50 per cent of all aluminium can production by 1995. The extent of its ambitions can be seen by the fact that at the end of last year only 15 to 16 per cent was recycled. In the US and Australia more than 60 per cent of drink cans are recycled. The industry has had to expand its recycling infrastructure to feed a Pounds 28m facility at Warrington in northern England dedicated only to can processing. The plant was established last year by Alcan of Canada, and is the first of its kind in Europe. Last year Warrington, which will ultimately have a capacity of 50,000 tonnes, processed 2,180 tonnes of used cans and other aluminium scrap collected by Alcan. While it has already processed 2,259 tonnes of UK cans in the first half this year, it is having to import the rest of its feedstock, mostly from the US. However, in August Acra opened the last of seven regional centres in the UK where scrap merchants and other collectors can exchange cans for cash. These 'aggregation centres' enable merchants to take 250kg loads of used cans to collection points close by instead of having to deliver direct to Warrington or to the Swansea collection centre operated by the Aluminium Company of America (Alcoa). Merchants get the same factory gate price as paid at Warrington (about Pounds 700 a tonne) and receive their cash between seven and 10 days after delivery. In the rest of Europe (including the European Free Trade Area countries) aluminium accounted for nearly half the 21bn cans consumed. Of these about 21 per cent were recycled - twice the percentage in 1987. Sweden, which has a mandatory deposit scheme on cans, had the highest recycling rate at 85 per cent, followed by Iceland at 75 per cent and Switzerland at 50 per cent. Aluminium is a relative newcomer to the food and drink industries, appearing first in 1958 with the revolutionary easy open end. Improvements are still being made. Mr Pruvost of Pechiney said that the thickness of can bodies had been reduced by 45 per cent and can ends by 15 per cent over a 20-year period. But the industry is under no illusions that mere technology will win the packaging battle. 'We have a 50 per cent recycling target for the mid-1990s,' said Mr Alexander Wirtz, chairman of the European Aluminium Association's packaging committee. 'In order to achieve it we need the support of consumers, retailers and municipalities.' Environmental concerns should help to give aluminium the edge, he feels. 'The challenge of the 1990s is, I believe, ecology - it is important we improve across Europe our waste management practices. Aluminium's life cycle is ideally suited.'</p>

			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Whitbread cautious despite marginal first-half increase WHITBREAD, the UK brewing and retailing group, showed resilience in 'depressed and highly competitive markets' with a marginal increase in first-half pre-tax profits from Pounds 142.5m to Pounds 143m. The results were at the top end of City forecasts but Sir Michael Angus, chairman, said: 'The outlook must be one of caution. The market place continues to reflect general uncertainty, trading conditions have not yet improved and margins are under pressure.' Performance in the second half will depend largely on the Christmas trading period but analysts forecast full-year profits of about Pounds 256m against last year's Pounds 222m. Earnings per share for the six months ended August 29 fell 3.9 per cent to 22.65p; the interim dividend is raised from 4.55p to 4.75p. Group trading profits increased 4 per cent to Pounds 129.6m on turnover 11.6 per cent ahead at Pounds 1.18bn. Beer profits rose from Pounds 39.1m to Pounds 44.1m and the group increased its share of the UK market from 12.8 per cent to 13.4 per cent. Volume sales grew 3 per cent against an overall market decline of 1 per cent. Boddington bitter led the advance with a 30 per cent increase in volume to become the best-selling ale brand in the take-home market. Murphy's stout volumes rose 30 per cent; and Stella Artois recorded a 10 per cent increase. The accounts include a Pounds 5m provision for bad debts and a similar charge is likely in the second half. Profits of the Pub Partnership leased and tenanted pubs fell 9 per cent to Pounds 30.8m following the disposal of a further 230 pubs to comply with the government's beer orders. However, Whitbread Inns, the 1,600 managed pubs, was the best performing business in the group's retail operations which lifted overall profits from Pounds 63.6m to Pounds 70.3m. Sales at Beefeater restaurants fell 5 per cent, but profits increased 5 per cent. Pizza Hut achieved profits in line with last year; and TGI Friday's and Thresher off-licences recorded 'significant increases' in sales and profits. The Travel Inn chain achieved occupancies of 85 per cent to 90 per cent and is being expanded. The group's net borrowings were virtually unchanged at Pounds 434.5m, 16.3 per cent of shareholders' funds. Lex, Page 24</p>

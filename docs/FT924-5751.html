			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Observer: Classical cat If Danny Chapchal's publicity handouts are to be believed then he is a company doctor with a fearsome reputation in making the high-tech end of the printing equipment business hum. However, the new proprietor of Atex, which supplies the computer pre-press systems to many of the world's leading newspapers, is also a classical music nut who is very proud of his cat called Herbie, named after von Karajan. Chapchal, who cannot function without high-brow music playing in the background, has a thing about conductors. 'A good conductor can turn the village band into the Philharmonic but a bad one can turn the Philharmonic into the village band,' says Chapchal, quoting Furtwangler, late of the Berlin Philharmonic. There are nothing like enough good conductors within the ranks of Britain's smaller businesses, according to Chapchal, who sees himself as one of the leading performers in his own field. Having qualified as an accountant, he joined Linotype in the UK in 1975 and has criss-crossed the printing equipment world reputedly turning round one company after another. He even managed to conduct business with the late Robert Maxwell without a cross word. But even he admits Atex is a far more difficult score. It is a multinational employing more than seven times as many staff as his own company, and it is losing money. If a blue chip like Kodak couldn't make a go of Atex, how can 47-year-old Chapchal? The fact that he and his consortium of venture capitalist backers are buying Atex minus its potentially costly legal problems is a big plus. But Atex has to hold on to its big proprietary customer base as it moves to new standard platform-based systems. If Chapchal can orchestrate this elusive opus, then he will be deservedly called Maestro of the pre-press.</p>

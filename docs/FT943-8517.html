			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / Members' complaints highlight 'loopholes' Details of cases in the pensions ombudsman's report illustrate what critics of pension law have for years been describing as loopholes. Three scheme members complained that their employer was not contributing the amount to the pension scheme recommended by the actuary. On investigation this proved correct and it subsequently emerged that some contributions had been retained by the parent company of the sponsoring employer. The managing director of the sponsoring employer, his wife and a pensions professional were scheme trustees. The employer went into liquidation in April 1993 but the parent company continued to trade. The managing director of the employer said that the company had been paying the most it could afford and at least kept the employees on the payroll before making them redundant in 1991. The professional trustee, in explaining the difficulties the scheme had, told the ombudsman that the managing director's wife had played no part in the affair as she was 'only a housewife'. In any event, he said he was not informed of the employer's reduced contributions. Although the ombudsman was powerless to force the employer to contribute at the rate necessary to pay all benefits - the law does not require that - he did order the parent company to turn over contributions it had withheld. Mr Q made a number of complaints. He said he could not obtain information about his benefits, that he had suspicions that his employer had financial difficulties and that the pension scheme might be affected. The employer was the corporate trustee of the scheme. It later transpired that a big payment to the trustee - on behalf of the scheme members - had actually been accepted by the bank as a credit in the employer's account prior to the company going into receivership. The scheme was left with a large deficit although the missing payment would have covered all benefits due. The ombudsman could not accept the complaint for investigation because, among other reasons, ordering restitution for Mr Q would disadvantage other scheme members. Pensions Ombudsman 1993-94. HMSO.

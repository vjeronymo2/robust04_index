			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Poland fails to take up loans POLAND has made minimal use of Dollars 8.1bn (Pounds 4.68bn) of western government-guaranteed credit lines promised since the autumn of 1989, according to a government report. This includes loans from the World Bank and other international financial institutions. The report by the Central Planning Office (CUP) says that, as of last January, concrete agreements had been signed with Poland for loans of Dollars 5.4bn. At the same time, Polish banks acting as a conduit for the funds had actually agreed to lend Dollars 1.7bn. However the actual sum used by Polish lenders in the last two years is Dollars 524.2m including a Dollars 300m World Bank structural adjustment which went to strengthen foreign currency reserves. The CUP report blames Poland's recession for the failure to take up credits as well as high domestic interest rates which have increased local investment costs. Polish banks, CUP says, are ill-equipped to handle loans and are unwilling to take lending risks. In addition, CUP points out that strings attached to loans by western governments make it difficult to find borrowers who fulfil the right requirements. The World Bank, which is committed to provide Dollars 2.2bn in 12 projects, has seen some Dollars 400m used. This performance is 'average' in the World Bank's experience given that half of the value of the loans was agreed only recently. Western governments have signed actual agreements with Poland to provide credits worth Dollars 3.7bn of the Dollars 5.5bn promised. However a mere Dollars 109.8m has actually spent on imports by Polish companies. Austria for example has offered to provide Dollars 435m of which a mere Dollars 23m has been committed in the form of guarantees for Austrian hotel construction projects. Germany, another major Polish trade partner, has seen Dollars 28.1m of the Dollars 1.6bn offered in trade credits actually used.</p>

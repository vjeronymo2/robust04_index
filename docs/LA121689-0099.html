			<p><P> December 16, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FERNANDO HAPPY AT $2 MILLION;  </P> <P> BASEBALL: DODGERS, VALENZUELA COMPROMISE WITH ONE-YEAR CONTRACT AT A HIGHER  SALARY, PLUS INCENTIVES. NOW TEAM CAN THINK ABOUT TRADING FOR AN OUTFIELDER.  </P> <P> Those who couldn't imagine Fernando Valenzuela in anything other than a Dodger  uniform no longer need try.  </P> <P> Ending a different sort of "Fernandomania" Friday, the Dodgers reached  agreement with the free agent pitcher on a one-year contract worth a guaranteed  $2 million. It includes incentives, rare in Dodger contracts, that could push  the salary to $2.5 million if Valenzuela is healthy enough to pitch the entire  season.  </P> <P> Hours before Valenzuela's lawyer, Dick Moss, said the pitcher would sign with  another team and end his 10-year stay with the Dodgers, the parties hammered  out a compromise. Valenzuela accepted less than his demand of three years at  $6.5 million but received a higher annual salary than the Dodgers' most recent  offer of two years at $1.7 million per year.  </P> <P> "We are sacrificing some, but you have to be a little bit romantic about this  game," said Tony DeMarco, Valenzuela's agent, who demanded at least a raise  from Valenzuela's $1.85 million salary last season. "Fernando loves the Dodgers  and wants to stay. And now everybody is happy."  </P> <P> Valenzuela reportedly settled for the short-term pact because few other teams  were willing to give him more due to shoulder problems that have caused him to  go 15-21 over the last two years. Because this contract has no second year, and  because he wasn't a highly ranked free agent, Valenzuela can return to the free  agent market again next winter. If proven healthy, he could earn substantially  more.  </P> <P> The Dodgers agreed to a last-minute raise in their offer because Valenzuela was  reportedly prepared to accept a similar deal with another team. The only team  with a confirmed interest was the Oakland Athletics, although sources say one  National League team, perhaps Philadelphia, also entered the sweepstakes.  </P> <P> "We were ready to go elsewhere by the end of the day, but Fernando wanted to  give the Dodgers one last chance," Moss said. "This is where he wanted to play  and he felt he owed them the courtesy of that one last meeting. We're all happy  it worked out."  </P> <P> Moss said he contacted Dodger Vice President Fred Claire in Hawaii Thursday  night and set up Friday's final session, the first time the parties had  negotiated in more than a week. Moss and DeMarco met in the offices of Bob  Walker, a Dodger legal adviser. Dodger owner Peter O'Malley and Claire  participated via the phone, according to Moss. After a lengthy discussion, an  agreement was reached around 4 p.m.  </P> <P> "When some people expressed some concern about his shoulder, Fernando decided  to do just a one-year deal and prove to everyone that he was healthy," Moss  said. "He is a man of incredible pride."  </P> <P> Said Claire: "We had explored many different options . . . but this made sense  for everybody. If Fernando enjoys a good year, he will be in a very strong  position next year. And we have an important pitcher for our ballclub."  </P> <P> Besides, maybe now Claire can get some sleep. Claire admitted that the thought  of losing a former Cy Young Award winner was enough to keep a Dodger official  awake nights.  </P> <P> "Not a day went by in the last two weeks when I didn't live with the thought  that I could get a phone call to say that Fernando had signed with another  team," Claire said.  </P> <P> Valenzuela was at his winter home in Mexico and unavailable for comment.  </P> <P> His immediate importance to the club is not on the mound, but in trade talks.  His presence gives the Dodgers six starting pitchers, meaning either coveted  Ramon Martinez or John Wetteland could be used as bait in a deal for a center  fielder. Several deals were possible last week at baseball's winter meetings,  but Claire was reluctant to give up any young arms without knowing he had  Valenzuela.  </P> <P> Expect to see such names as Boston's Ellis Burks, Philadelphia's Len Dykstra,  New York Met Juan Samuel and St. Louis' Vince Coleman or Willie McGee being  tossed around Dodger offices in the next few weeks.  </P> <P> "This certainly gives us added depth at pitching," Claire said. He said that  during his current Hawaii vacation, "I have talked to about 15 general  managers, and I'm going to pursue things day by day and see what happens."  </P> <P> Certainly few thought this one-year settlement would happen with Valenzuela,  29, who has a career record of 128-103 with a 3.19 earned-run average.  </P> <P> After last season, bolstered by winning five of his last seven decisions after  not winning for nearly a year because of his tired shoulder, Valenzuela  demanded a three-year contract. He had finished the year 10-13 with a 3.43 ERA.  </P> <P> The Dodgers countered with a one-year guaranteed deal worth $1.5 million, with  a similar option year. Valenzuela promptly declared free agency.  </P> <P> Said DeMarco at the time: "We obviously have a difference of opinion. We just  want what is fair."  </P> <P> After the Dodgers failed in their bid to sign free agent pitcher Mark Langston,  they made another pitch for Valenzuela last week, increasing their offer to  $1.7 million annually for two years. Again, Valenzuela would not listen.  Sources say he felt the Dodgers were not appreciating his years of service, and  taking him for granted.  </P> <P> But despite talk of big New York Yankee dollars, Valenzuela soon learned he  wouldn't get richer anywhere else. And the Dodgers realized although he may not  have been as important to other teams, he was certainly important to them. Only  when both parties realized the seriousness of their predicament, and how much  they needed each other, did they come up with the special deal that DeMarco  said contained O'Malley's personal stamp.  </P> <P> "Peter O'Malley personally helped with this; I was very impressed," DeMarco  said. "This has worked out well for everybody."  </P></p>

			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / Defence agency shows loss of Pounds 449m THE Defence Research Agency, adviser to the Ministry of Defence, has suffered a loss of Pounds 449m in property and other fixed assets in its transformation from government agency to a more autonomous trading fund. The agency's overall loss for 1993 was Pounds 409.8m compared with a profit of Pounds 48.4m in 1992. The figures, published yesterday, were prepared as a dry run for future publications of audited annual results for the agency. The agency has been a trading fund since April which gives it similar accounting obligations to those of a company. The loss came when management at the agency identified assets surplus to its needs and returned them to the MoD without a cash payment in return. It means the DRA starts as a trading fund without many of the overheads it had as a government agency. Turnover in 1993 was Pounds 795.8m, with the agency developing and testing technologies mainly for the MoD. These include guidance systems for bombs and missiles, new forms of radar and a lightweight night-vision system that is already being sold to fire services for use in smoke-filled buildings. Mr John Chisholm, the agency's chief executive, said: 'Up to one-third of physics-based applied research in the UK comes from the DRA.' He said the organisation would set up centres for the exploitation of technologies for both military and civilian use, so that it could 'contribute to the wider economy'. Apart from the night-vision camera for fire-fighting, the agency is also working with the Civil Aviation Authority on using military aircraft tracking systems to improve air traffic control. Mr Chisholm acknowledged that defence cuts were likely to reduce the agency's income by Pounds 100m a year 'over the next few years'. A package of 2,000 job cuts among 10,500 staff is under way. Most of the cuts have been among administration staff as part of a strategy to reduce the proportion of support staff at the agency from two-thirds to a third of employees.</p>

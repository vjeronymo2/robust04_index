			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Yarrow workers vote for action over 2% pay offer Workers at Yarrow Shipbuilders on the Clyde have voted for industrial action by a substantial majority. This follows their rejection of a pay offer worth 2 per cent linked to the introduction of performance-related pay. The yard is part of GEC, the defence and electronics company. Officials from all trade unions at the UK's largest warship yard will meet tomorrow to discuss the next move. It is expected they will recommend the introduction of an overtime ban, one-day strikes or a work to rule before any resort to an all-out stoppage. 'The offer is shocking,' said Mr John Dolan, the GMB general union's chief convener at the yard. 'We are looking for a substantial increase.' As many as 80 per cent of those voting among the 3,400 workforce have backed the use of industrial action and an all-out strike if necessary. The company has proposed the 2 per cent increase would be conditional on acceptance of sweeping changes in working practices. These would involve, among other reforms, the introduction of Friday afternoon working at overtime rates that would increase the basic week from 36 hours to 42 hours as well as the abolition of a 10-minute tea-break. The most controversial demand by management is for the introduction of performance-related pay from next July for all manual workers. The unions believe this would produce inequalities and cause divisions among workers. They also see it as a threat to the continuation of collective bargaining in the yard. At present Yarrow appears to be in a strong commercial position. It has a full order book at least until 1997 with three frigates to be constructed for the Royal Navy and two for the Malaysian Navy. The HMS Grafton, a Type 23 frigate, is to be launched this Saturday. Union officials are determined to avoid a repetition of last year's strike by manual workers that lasted a month while the white-collar staff worked normally. This time the whole workforce is involved. The officials want to pursue a more careful strategy of escalation, giving the company time to improve its offer and ensuring workers do not suffer the consequences of a protracted stoppage. However, they believe that management will have to provide a much better offer to avoid serious industrial conflict.</p>

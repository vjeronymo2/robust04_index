			<p>BFN     [Text] Since noon, the successor to President  Houphouet-Boigny at the head of Democratic Party of Cote  d'Ivoire-African Democratic Rally [PDCI-RDA] has been known.  Henry Konan Bedie has become PDCI chairman. He was unanimously  elected by PDCI activists, who took the big hall of the Palais  de Congress by storm this morning during an extraordinary  congress of the party. All the top-level dignitaries of the  PDCI were in attendance. After being designated by the  participants, the president accepted the mandate. Here is an  extract of his statement:    [Begin Bedie recording] We are also happy about the support  committees, which are springing up throughout the country to  back our actions at the head of the state and government. These  committees, formed by civil organizations, are renovators. The  bedrock of our fight for development, social progress, and  peace, these organizations are from today support committees for  the forces of peace -- for all our forces for peace --  committees for the defense of our liberties, committees for the  respect of law and republican order, committees for civic action  and for political, economic and social mobilization, and  committees for the nation and for development. In brief,  comittees for the defense of PDCI-RDA ideals.    Let us now turn to the most-shared concerns of our  compatriots: human and pastoral hydraulics and rural sites. I  commit herewith the prime minister and the government to tackle  the rehabilitation of village and rural communities' wells and  feeder roads. We can do this without confounding the party and  the state -- and without waiting -- as more than 3 billion CFA  francs have been budgeted for the well-being of the rural  population.    Dear participants, we shall undertake these works  immediately, rehabilitating sites in northern Cote d'Ivoire  first because of the rainy season, and we shall continue after  the main rainy season in the forest areas. Dear participants, a  new wind is blowing over Cote d'Ivoire -- let us seize this  opportunity through a permanent and lasting mobilization. The  exemplary holding of the extraordinary congress shows that there  are no cleavages or camps in our great party, as our detractors  had hoped for. The congress has shown that we remain united.  This unity is nourished and maintained by our permanent ideal  of peace, an ideal which shall be our first objective throughout  our mandate. President Houphouet-Boigny liked to say that his  force, his capacity for action, came from the presence of a  prime minister and a PDCI secretary general at his sides -- and  especially from a party behind him.

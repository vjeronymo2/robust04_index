			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1357.15(q) Services in Relation to Permanency Planning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We are proposing in &sect;1357.15(q) that the State CFSP must describe how these services will help meet the permanency provisions for children and families in sections 427 and 471 of the Act, e.g., preplacement preventive services, reunification and adoption services, and long-term foster care/independent living services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ``permanency provisions'' were enacted by the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96&hyph;272) which was passed in an effort to improve child welfare services nationwide; it focused on the importance of providing preventive and crisis intervention services and establishing permanency for the children in foster care. Through permanency planning, children were to be placed in permanent living arrangements as quickly as possible. At the heart of this concept is the ``reasonable efforts'' requirement to prevent family separation in cases where a child could be kept safely at home, provide appropriate services for family reunification once a child was placed in foster care, or to make another permanent living arrangement, such as adoption.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We believe that the funds authorized by the new family preservation and family support legislation provide an opportunity for States to recommit themselves to the goals of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pub. L. 96&hyph;272 and to use these funds to help bring about the changes that will assure permanency for all children.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1357.15(r)&blank;Decision-Making Process: Selection of family Support Programs for Funding <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We are proposing in &sect;1357.15(r) that the State's CFSP include an explanation of how agencies and organizations were selected to provide family support services and how these agencies and organizations meet the requirement that family support services be ``community-based.'' This paragraph proposes to implement section 431(a)(2) of the Act which states that ``family support services means community-based services to promote the well-being of children and families *&blank;*&blank;*''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Community-based services can be provided under a variety of auspices. (See  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;1357.10(c).) Therefore, we urge the State to consider a wide range of family support providers in selecting the most appropriate agencies or organizations to provide this service based on the goals and objectives in the CFSP. These may include community-based organizations (CBOs), public or private nonprofit agencies, and Indian tribal organizations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We considered requiring the State to pass through a certain percentage of the funds to CBOs to provide family support services but concluded that the circumstances in each State are so varied and allotments to the States are not large enough to justify such a requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In making funding decisions, however, we strongly recommend that States examine the work and accomplishments of community-based organizations and look to them as highest priority potential providers of family support services. It is these organizations, based in and trusted by the community, which typically have the knowledge and expertise to provide these services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

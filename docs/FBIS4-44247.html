			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara, June 27 (AA) -- Foreign Ministry spokesman  Ferhat Ataman said on Monday [27 June] that a demonstration of  the separatist terrorist PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan]  organization held in Frankfurt has turned to a terrorist  activity. Ataman said the demonstration was a kind of terrorist  activity in spite of the guarantee that the German Government  has given adding that Ankara felt disappointment on the issue.  Ataman said necessary initiations were made in Ankara, Bonn and  Frankfurt on the issue. He said "we think Germany's decision to  ban PKK should not be diluted and this terror organization  should not be encouraged" adding that "we will be in close  connection with the German officials."    During the demonstration, separatists carried a picture of  the leader of PKK and pieces of clothes symbolizing colors of  the separatist terrorist organization.    Turkey earlier expressed pleasure to see determination of  Germany to extradite supporters of terrorists who violated  German laws.</p>

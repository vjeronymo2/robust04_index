			<p>BFN     [Text] Macao, May 29 (XINHUA) -- The continuity of China's  most favoured nation (MFN) trading status was not only  beneficial to China's economic and trade development, but also  good for Macao's economy.    Maria Gabriela dos Remedios Cesar, director of the Macao  Government's economic department, was quoted by local newspapers  as saying that the continuity of China's MFN status was a good  news for businessmen and also was favourable for steady  development of Sino-U.S. trade relations.    In another development, chairman of the Macao Export and  Import Association Victor Ng said it was a sensible act of the  U.S. Government to continue China's MFN status, for it is good  for economic development of both sides.    He also said that it was a good thing that the U.S.  Government has ever done to separate human rights from MFN  issue. However, he added, it is hard to understand that the  U.S. Government use munitions as a condition for continuity of  China's MFN status.</p>

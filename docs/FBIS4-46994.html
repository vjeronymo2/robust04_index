			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Bill Clinton in Moscow: Analysis and </F> Evaluation"]    [Text] On the eve of B. Clinton's visit to the Russian  Federation (in January 1994) a large memo was prepared for him,  "On the Sociopolitical and Economic Situation in Russia at the  End of 1993 and the Beginning of 1994."    It was noted in the economics section that the 1993 Russian  Federation GNP had decreased by 18 percent, and the rates of  uncompensated decline of the industrial-production potential  decreased 2.3 times more rapidly than in 1992, which was  evidence of an irreversible decline of reserves of accumulation  and reproduction in many branches. In three months of 1993 the  decline of production reached the greatest amount in all the  time of the reforms (35 percent). Monetary measures for  financial and credit stabilization led to a "stagflation  tailspin" that was continually perpetuated with each round. This  enabled the West basically to solve strategic problems:  demilitarizing Russia's economy, adapting the resource potential  of the CIS countries to the existing world economic system, and  making it impossible to rapidly restore Russia's  military-industrial complex in the event that forces unfriendly  to the West were to come to power.    At the same time it was noted that the inadequate  "elasticity" of Russia's leadership regarding U.S.  recommendations to follow the political technologies of the  transition period led to a situation where the possibility that  ultra-nationalistic forces would come to power in Russia became  more than real. The economic situation in the country could  contribute to this to a significant degree if B. Yeltsin's  regime continues to pursue its present economic policy. In this  case the stabilizing influence will reduce inflation by the end  of 1994 to 3-5 percent per month, there will be a significant  reduction of the interest rate on interbank credit, and the  exchange rate with the dollar, which depends on the world parity  balance of prices of the main raw material goods exported from  Russia, will be reinforced.    This, in turn, will lead to a decline of the GNP by another  20-25 percent, complete destructuring of Russia's economy, the  elimination of exports with the exception of energy sources in  keeping with GATT quotas, and investments mainly in fuel  extracting branches, the infrastructures that serve them, trade,  and service, as well as the degradation of private production  and the banking system. According to data contained in the  report, unemployment will increase to 15-18 million (including  hidden). The differentiation in incomes will amount to 30 units.    There is a real threat of an economic "stagflation infarct"  during the May-June 1994 period: the effect of the direct  halting of the movement of production prices, because of the  rapidly growing shortfalls of deliveries of resources based on  the explosive growth of nonpayments, which, in turn, occurred  because of the absence of the regular portion of preferential  credit for reproduction, resonating with the seasonal background  of procurements for agricultural work and the regular price hike  in order to increase profitability and make up for the  consequences of the high inflation.    But such a development of events is not likely to occur  since  the impact of the strongest social factor, reflected in the form  of political pressure from the State Duma and the powerful  lobbying of the production part of the government, will force  Russia's leadership in April-May 1994 to resort to another  inflationary invigoration of production resulting from pumping  money into the national economy through preferential credit, as  occurred in June-July 1992 and May-June 1993, each time with  more severe sociopolitical consequences.    Such half-measures at a lower circle of the "stagflationary  spiral" will promote a further considerable reduction of the  political influence of reformist forces as a whole. Moreover,  they will significantly weaken the forces of that part of the  political elite on whose assumption of power in the post-Yeltsin  period the U.S. leadership was tacitly placing its bets. The  transfer of power was to have begun in September-October 1993  and it was to have ended president.    These American recommendations were presented to individuals  close to President B. Yeltsin who formulate the country's  domestic political policy, and they expressed their agreement.  It was a matter of a comprehensive program for "stage-by-stage  adaptation" of the economic and sociopolitical situation in  Russia to world economic and political realities, developed on  the basis of the theory of "discreteness of periods of crisis  pressure" and "shock-absorbing stage-like nation of social  adjustment," geared to Russian parameters (the model of  seasonal-diametric periodicity of the political process and  imposed upon it a stage-by-stage, "gradual-graduated" transition  to a new socioeconomic quality with "social respites" at each  "stage" of the reform).    The program included a gradual transfer of power to groups  of  the Russian elite who are loyal to the West and who were  supposed to crowd out extremist, nationalist, and communist  forces with effective political and sociolegal reforms, being in  "soft opposition to Yeltsin." These economic transformations  were to be based on Yavlinskiy's program of "bisectoral  planning-market structurization of the national economy" on the  basis of political stabilization--Shakhray's regional-centrist  policy.    It was also noted in the report that under Russia's concrete  conditions, in addition to relying on specific elite groupings  and taking into account the personal peculiarities of the  president of the Russian Federation, it is extremely important  to continue to work actively with those closest to him, meaning  above all A. Korzhakov, E. Pain, and Yu. Baturin.    Korzhakov and Baturin have been exerting the most influence  on the president recently. They have practically completely  monopolized all channels of information of any kind, including  that from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and intelligence, and  they have taken full charge of the final editing of drafts of  legislative and administrative acts okayed by leaders of  government departments and signed by the president.    If Korzhakov and Ilyushin control the  administrative-information block of the distributive-state  infrastructure, Yu. Baturin is the key figure in the formation  of the strategic line of the head of state. According to figures  in the report, Yu. Baturin is the "architect" and main "pusher"  of all the most radical political decisions adopted by the  president in 1993.    Referring to the opinions of the aforementioned individuals  from B. Yeltsin's inner circle, the latter is prepared to listen  to recommendations from his Western friends concerning a  reasonable adjustment of the economic and political reforms, but  he will take real steps only if he has no opposition at all. No  pressure on himself or apparent concessions can be expected from  the president, especially at the present time when he is  convinced that he is supported by power structures that are  faithful to him.    The report gives assessments of the "Zhirinovskiy  phenomenon." It was necessary for the ruling groupings to  support this phenomenon for a certain amount of time (not  Zhirinovskiy, but precisely his phenomenon). Here they assume  that without Zhirinovskiy his faction would rapidly become a  branch of the Russian Federation Communist Party. As long as  Zhirinovskiy is present he will not allow this but during the  time of his parliamentary activity he will completely discredit  himself and will not be able to run seriously for the post of  president. Additionally, his presence will contribute to support  from the West for Russia's president. And, conversely,  Zhirinovskiy's rapid departure from the arena will considerably  strengthen the position of neo-communist forces and statesmen  and could make their assumption of power a reality. The report  recommended to Bill Clinton:    that he personally exert a constant influence on Russia's  president since B.N. has a sharply negative reaction to  influence from third parties;    taking into account the situation that has developed,  recommendations must be aimed at adjusting the reforms in the  direction of social priorities, expanding the social base of  support for the president, firing the most odious figures,  providing more effective publicity for economic and political  reforms, etc.;    U.S. political leadership should expand the range of  interaction with the most diverse political forces in Russia,  taking into account the complexity and unpredictability of the  development of the situation;    special attention should be devoted to work with all the  "elite" groupings in the high echelons of power;    in parallel, active work should be done to arrange  cooperation with other CIS countries in order not to allow the  restoration of another confederation;    taking into account the economic situation and other  difficulties in the Russian Federation, within the framework of  diplomatic etiquette, there should be a certain amount of  strictness and consistency in the achievement of results needed  in the West. The main purpose of Clinton's visit to the Russian  Federation was worded as "to achieve results favorable for the  national interests of the United States" (within the framework  of the doctrine of "Partnership for Peace") and to keep Russia  on the track of "democratic" transformations. Of course Clinton  and his circle also planned to raise the "political" rating of  the U.S. President and have the maximum possible "favorable"  effect on the population of Russia. Clinton managed to achieve  practically all of the goals that were set. The main results of  his visit amounted to the following:    he forced the Russian Federation to accept the majority of  his conditions while at the same time avoiding any commitments  to render any kind of appreciable economic aid to Russia;    he promised the Russian Federation president to make  reimbursement for "all costs of dismantling nuclear weapons in  Ukraine." More than $1 billion guaranteed to Kravchuk for  dismantling nuclear warheads will be paid to Russia for  delivering oil, gas, etc. to Kiev;    as compensation for this service, he achieved agreement from  the Russian Federation to participate in the privatization of  Russian enterprises (the possibilities of acquiring shares for  hard currency) "to be credited to repayment of part of the  immense Russian debt to the United States";    B. Yeltsin's attempts to obtain special advantages in  relations with the CIS countries were roundly rejected by  Clinton. But he made it clearly understood that because of  national-ethnic, economic, and other factors the United States  would not object to the development of relations between the  Russian Federation and Belarus.    Clinton approved the personnel reshuffling carried out  before  his visit (Yakovlev, Baturin, Chubays) and, out of "essential  tactical" considerations, he agreed to the resignation of Gaydar  and his team.    The corresponding strategic assessments and recommendations  were submitted to the U.S. President in December 1993. The  events that occurred during the past four months show that the  American program for influencing "Moscow's policy" continues to  be implemented fairly effectively with respect to its basic  points.</p>

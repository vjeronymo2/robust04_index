			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / People: Rebuilding Salomon Salomon Brothers, the US investment house, has enticed Alastair Kerr onto its UK equity sales team, part of the rebuilding process in that department. Kerr - 'one of the most successful and experienced UK equity salesmen in London', according to Salomon - has to date only worked for UK houses, latterly Barclays de Zoete Wedd, and before that Morgan Grenfell Securities. He began his career at Hoare Govett in 1975, and will find himself sitting close to an old Hoare chum at Salomon, Peter Stephens. While rivals say he could 'get a rude awakening' - finding that business does not always flow as easily as at a mainstream UK broker - they are in no doubt he will be handsomely rewarded. The fall-out after last summer's bond-rigging scandal hit the equity side, including the UK, particularly badly, with key salesmen leaving. Gary Wolens, head of European equity sales, says the rebuilding process will entail hiring a few more select 'best'. But Salomon still has to convince its rivals. Said one salesman at another house: 'It's like hearing the first cuckoo in spring even though it's pouring'.</p>

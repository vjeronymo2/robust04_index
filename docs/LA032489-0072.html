			<p><P> March 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST : LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P>  UNIVERSAL, GARNER SETTLE OUT OF COURT  </P> <P> Actor James Garner's $16.5-million lawsuit against Universal Studios, scheduled  to go to trial Monday after a six-year wait, was settled out of court Thursday  for an undisclosed amount.  </P> <P> Garner sued the Universal City studio for fraud, deceit and breach of contract  for paying the actor what he said was a mere fraction of the 37.5% of earnings  from reruns and foreign sales of his 1974-80 TV series "The Rockford Files"  promised by his contract. Garner had charged that creative bookkeeping on the  part of Universal had cheated him out of his share of the show's net profits in  syndication, leaving him with $249,000 out of gross revenues of $119 million.  </P> <P> "I can live with this deal, and live very comfortably," Garner said in a  prepared statement. Although it was part of the terms of Garner's agreement  that the amount of the settlement not be revealed, Garner had previously turned  down an offer from Universal of more than $6 million.  </P></p>

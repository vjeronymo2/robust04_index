			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Mexico The Mexican peso's sharp fall and the government's failed efforts to defend it have significantly increased the cost of servicing Mexico's debt while sharply reducing the nation's ability to pay for it. But the present emergency need not prove a rerun of 1982. The existence of Nafta should limit the hurt; it is in the interests of the US and Canada to prevent a full-blown financial and economic collapse in Mexico that could culminate with immigrants and cheap imports pouring over their borders. A comprehensive package is required. Internationally, the US, possibly with Canada and the IMF, must put together an emergency credit or guarantee facility, probably worth more than the Dollars 10bn required to restore credibility. Internally, the government must demonstrate its commitment to a balanced budget by accelerating the privatisation programme, while also providing support for the endangered banking sector. If the immediate devaluation's economic and political damage can be limited, a weaker currency could strengthen the Mexican economy through an export-driven recovery.</p>

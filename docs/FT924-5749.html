			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Thorn strikes a chord It may yet be demonstrated that Thorn EMI paid over the odds for Virgin. But Sir Colin Southgate, Thorn's chairman, did an impressive job yesterday in persuading the market there is no early cause for concern. Thorn is clearly getting to grips with its controversial acquisition, has cut out a swathe of costs duplicated by the EMI music business and even managed to squeeze out a Pounds 5m first-half profit which few had anticipated. Vindication for the Pounds 550m price tag, though, will only come in 1993-94 if Virgin is seen to have contributed the Pounds 80m-Pounds 85m being muttered about today. That said, there was plenty in the interim statement to justify a 20p bounce in the shares. The music industry may be sluggish, but at least the evidence is that it is still growing. EMI, excluding Virgin, should widen its margins for the year as a whole. Meanwhile, the rental division's UK performance may have been predictably drab and continuing losses from Rumbelows disappointing in the wake of last year's provisions. But the growth rate of Rent-A-Center in the US is in the high teens. Group cash flow remains formidably strong and gross interest cover is a comfortable 4 1/2 times. One uncertainty is whether the market will value Thorn primarily as a defensive or as a cyclical stock. That it has both qualities at the same time may be an advantage at this uncertain stage in the cycle. In the longer term there are risks, but these would be offset if the sale of lighting and security - and thereafter demerger of the two main businesses - eventually went ahead.</p>

			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Bishopsgate looks to Belfast: Businesses with 23 years of dealing with terrorism FOR the City of London, still trying to come to terms with the massive Bishopsgate bombing, Belfast's well-developed anti-terrorist procedures may provide some valuable lessons. After 23 years of 'the troubles', the businessmen and women of Belfast are used to coping with terrorism. At the heart of Belfast's robust defences lies an ability to cope and a systematic awareness of the dangers of terrorism reflected in everything from building design to working practices. Mr Alasdair MacLaughlin, secretary of the Northern Ireland Banker's Association and a former head of the CBI in the province, said: 'There is a systemic awareness here which goes from the architects and engineers who design the buildings through to the staff and security personnel who are trained and experienced in dealing with emergencies and disruptions. 'Structurally, the more modern buildings are better able to withstand the effects of bomb damage, while the people have developed a resilience and determination to carry on regardless. This has all developed into an ability to cope.' Underpinning Belfast's stoic attitude to the IRA bombers is a general acceptance that even with a major security operation the bombers still find a way of getting through. (In Belfast the police and army numbers at around 4,000 - one for every 125 inhabitants - double that of London). The emphasis is on good contingency planning, well-oiled evacuation procedures and meticulous attention to good office-keeping. Mr Walter Jess, a senior manager at Northern Bank, said: 'If a bomb goes off near one of our buildings, within minutes the contingency plan goes into effect. 'We have contractors on standby at all times to carry out emergency repairs, and all our staff know exactly where they must go if they have to be temporarily relocated and what they have to do.' One senior bank executive based in the city said: 'We would always expect to be up and working the next day - with or without a desk.' In 1992 two big bombs struck Belfast's business district, ripping out the windows from a dozen office blocks, but many businesses were functioning again within hours. One Belfast banker said that his 500 headquarters staff can be evacuated to a safe collection point in under three minutes. Once the alarm goes the priority is to get out. 'Staff are not even allowed to take their coats with them. Nobody ignores a bomb warning here' he said. Mr Ivan Carruthers, a Belfast-based partner of the UK accounting firm Ernst and Young, said a 'clean-desks' policy and the backing-up and storing of computer files off-site had minimised information loss in 1992. Bomb blast on tall buildings in confined areas can suck paper out to be scattered far and wide. Significantly, Ernst &amp; Young says that it did not lose 'a single piece of paper' in the two large car bombs of 1992. Most Belfast office buildings are built to minimise the effects of blast damage. According to Mr MacLaughlin, 'there are few of the glass palaces here that you see in London'. Most office block windows also have a thin plastic adhesive covering on the inside. This has the effect of making the pane fall as a sheet when the blast shatters it, rather than flying into thousands of pieces and particles of glass dust. Dust covers are also placed over computers and other equipment at the end of the day. Most Belfast businessmen are ambivalent about tight security checks on vehicles entering the city. They are quick to complain when traffic hold-ups caused by the checkpoints disrupt their business. But Mr MacLaughlin said: 'It is rare that the city is paralysed.' Mr Jess summed up Belfast's experience saying: 'I would doubt that the additional precautions have resulted in any significant cost to doing business here. The bombs have done no more damage than, say, the higher levels of strikes on the mainland. There is a limit to what you can do. You must still have a congenial working environment without creating fortresses. Economic life and business has gone on regardless. What we cannot calculate is the cost on the province of those companies that have simply not considered coming here because of the image.'</p>

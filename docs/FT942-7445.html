			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / International Company News: Malaysian group to raise MDollars 722m Berjaya, the diversified conglomerate which has rapidly grown into one of Malaysia's biggest companies, has announced rights issues aimed at raising MDollars 722m (USDollars 278.85m) to fund several new ventures. The issue is being split between the Berjaya Group and its main listed unit, Berjaya Industrial. Berjaya Group, which controls a 58 per cent stake in Berjaya Industrial, aims to raise more than MDollars 500m by issuing 254m new shares at MDollars 2 each. Berjaya Industrial aims to raise MDollars 214m by issuing 126m shares at MDollars 1.70 each. Berjaya said that new investments undertaken by the group had increased its funding requirements. Berjaya is controlled by Mr Vincent Tan, a Chinese Malaysian closely connected with some of Malaysia's senior political figures. Mr Tan, through Berjaya, has been aggressively expanding his business interests and is now involved in lottery management schemes in Malaysia and China, a timber project in the Solomon Islands and numerous resort developments around the eastern Asia region. Berjaya, with North West Water of the UK, is undertaking one of Malaysia's biggest infrastructure projects - a MDollars 6bn national sewerage scheme. Berjaya is also involved in several light industrial businesses. One of the group's latest ventures is the Malaysian franchise for the US 'Kenny Rogers Roasters' restaurant chain.</p>

			<p><P> June 18, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD CUP '90;  </P> <P> ONE-MAN ADVANTAGE ISN'T ENOUGH FOR URUGUAY;  </P> <P> GROUP E: PLAYING WITH ONLY 10 MEN IN THE SECOND HALF PROVES TO BE NO PROBLEM AS  BELGIUM WINS, 3-1, TO ADVANCE TO THE SECOND ROUND.  </P> <P> Captain Jan Ceulemans finished off an impressive night of offensive ingenuity  with a goal while his team was down one man on Sunday, helping Belgium to a 3-1  victory over Uruguay and into the second round of the World Cup.  </P> <P> Defender Eric Gerets was ejected just before halftime. But Ceulemans stunned  Uruguay with a 20-yard shot in the first minute of the second half. Lei  Clijsters and Enzo Scifo had scored in the first half.  </P> <P> Uruguayan substitute Pablo Bengoechea scored in the 73rd minute when Belgium  was momentarily playing with nine men because of an injury.  </P> <P> Scifo had his second strong game in a row to put Belgium among the top  contenders for the championship. The Belgians have four points in Group E --  they also beat South Korea, 2-0.  </P> <P> Led by Enzo Francescoli and Ruben Sosa, Uruguay mounted a steady attack against  Belgium in the second half. But Belgium stayed back and packed its defense to  limit the Uruguayans' space.  </P> <P> "It fully deserved the win," Uruguay Coach Oscar Tabarez said of Belgium. "They  made no errors, we made a lot in defense."  </P> <P> Uruguay meets South Korea in the final first-round match Thursday, while  Belgium goes against Spain.  </P> <P> In the first half, Clijsters finished off a combination play with a powerful  header to give Belgium the lead in the 14th minute. Ceulemans set up a  give-and-go with Bruno Versavel and then sent Michel De Wolf deep on the left  wing. The defender passed to the other side to a charging Clijsters.  </P> <P> The second goal was a solo effort by Scifo, who scored on a swerving  right-footed drive of 30 yards.  </P> <P> "The early expulsion created lots of problems for us," Belgian Coach Guy Thys  said. "We had to go back massively in defense."  </P> <P> Gerets had trouble containing Sosa all night and was given a yellow card in the  37th minute for an illegal tackle. Seven minutes and a few fouls later, Gerets  again pulled down Sosa and was sent off.  </P> <P> But Ceulemans' goal made it easy. Versavel beat three defenders on the left and  crossed the ball to the center, where the captain was unguarded. He unleashed a  hard shot past goalie Fernando Alvez.  </P> <P> Gerets will also miss Thursday's match against Spain.  </P></p>

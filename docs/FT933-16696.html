			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: MPs back plan for aerospace industry CALLS FOR the government to develop a technology acquisition plan for the aerospace industry have been strongly endorsed by an influential cross-party committee of MPs, David Owen writes. The MPs are expected to echo in a report to be published later this month calls by the Department of Trade and Industry's aviation committee for increased government backing for the sector to help British aerospace companies keep pace with their overseas rivals. The MPs - on the trade and industry select committee - will recommend that the DTI should work more closely with the Ministry of Defence, the industry's biggest customer, to chart a strategic course for Britain's aerospace sector. They are expected to urge that a regular survey of the level of government support for aerospace in Britain and other countries be compiled and to warn that Britain could be squeezed out of international markets unless adequate resources for technological R&amp;D are provided. In a confidential report last October the aviation committee - which includes civil servants and industry representatives - called for Britain to develop a national strategic technology acquisition plan. It said it was 'imperative' to protect Britain's position as a world class aerospace manufacturer that the government-corporate sector partnership in research and technology acquisition be reinforced. Funding by the government-industry partnership should 'at least be in proportion to the investment undertaken by our closest competitors and collaborators'.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Faysal Makram, Iqbal 'Abdallah, Zaki Shihab, and </F> Muhammad 'Allam: "North Preparing To Attack Hadhramaut"]    [Excerpts] Sanaa, Aden, Cairo -- Neutral sources said  yesterday that northern forces were continuing their pressure on  southern forces, that they had already seized Shabwah  Governorate, which is rich in oil, and that their next step will  be to penetrate Hadhramaut Governorate, birthplace of Yemeni  Socialist Party [YSP] Secretary General 'Ali Salim al-Bid.  [passage omitted]    Dr. 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Dali, member of the YSP Political  Bureau, has told AL-HAYAH that meetings will be held in a few  days between officials of the new state and the Egyptian  Government. He pointed out that an envoy from Aden will  tomorrow submit a request to join the Arab League. Al-Dali  said: "'Ali Salim al-Bid and the Yemeni people in the south are  most appreciative of President Husni Mubarak's position on the  Yemeni crisis," describing it as a "courageous position."    Last week Mubarak held Yemeni President 'Ali Salih  responsible for the continuation of the fighting and urged him  to observe an unconditional cease-fire and to initiate a  dialogue. He also described the northern forces' presence in  the south as "occupation." Al-Dali added: "Al-Bid would not  have barked on the secession step without consulting with a  number of Arab leaders. He did not name them. He interpreted  the Arab silence about the the question of recognizing the state  as "positive and aimed at studying the situation." He expressed  his belief that "Arab recognition will take place within days."  He noted that "President Mubarak, United Arab Emirates  President Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al Nuhayyan, and most Arab  states stressed that the continuation of the war means  destroying unity."</p>

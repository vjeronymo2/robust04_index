			<p><P> October 23, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> JAPANESE ASSAIL MOVES TO BAN FISHING BY DRIFT NETS  </P> <P> Japanese fishermen today criticized international moves to ban drift-net  fishing, which conservationists say threatens to wipe out much of the world's  tuna stocks in a few years.  </P> <P> The Japan Fisheries Assn. called the move to stop drift-net fishing in  international waters "an arbitrary attempt . . . without scientific knowledge."  </P> <P> "It is really unfortunate for human beings to be swayed by emotional  discussions," it said.  </P> <P> In drift net or "wall of death" fishing, Japanese and Taiwan fleets lay  curtain-like nets up to three miles long that trap almost everything in their  path.  </P> <P> Conservationists say the drift nets catch so much tuna that stocks could be  depleted within a few years. They also catch and kill thousands of dolphins,  seals, baby whales and sea birds every year.  </P> <P> "We have been doing that for a long time," said Hajime Nishimura, an acting  director of the association. "We fishermen are not trying to exhaust marine  resources. We think in the long term," he said.  </P> <P> Earlier this year, Japan said it would cut the number of its drift-net vessels  in the South Pacific next season by two-thirds, or down to 20.  </P> <P> "Now we need to conduct scientific research to collect enough data to decide  what impact drift-net fishing has on the environment. Then we can decide what  to do," Nishimura said.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Studio interview with French Defense Minister Francois </F> Leotard and -- by live hook-up -- with UN Commander General Jean  Cot in Zagreb, by announcer Anne Sinclair; program includes  recorded message by Bosnia-Herzegovina President Alija  Izetbegovic, in French -- from the "Sept dur Sept" program]    [Excerpts] [Sinclair] Good evening. Last Saturday [5  February], right in the middle of the market in Sarajevo, a  shell left 68 dead and 200 wounded. It took this carnage, the  nausea and disgust of public opinion, for the determination of  the West to take hold. At the initiative of France and  encouraged by the United States, NATO gave the Serbs an  ultimatum to lift the blockade on Sarajevo. Mr. Defense  Minister [Francois Leotard], good evening. We will be taking  stock of the situation shortly with General Cot, who will be  with us, and this is very exceptional, in a two way link-up from  Zagreb, and with Isabelle Baillancourt, our special  representative in Sarajevo. But we immediately have a question  that is in everyone's mind. Have we started a process which  carries with it the risk of extending the war in Europe?    [Leotard] It is because of the very existence of this risk  that we have been there, since the beginning, since 1991. We  are there because Europe, and the French first of all, realized  that, starting from that region, there could be a chain of  events -- which history has already shown us, for that matter --  a chain of events dangerous for all of Europe. It is for that  reason. So we have had the risk of expanding [of the war] up to  now, and we are still facing it. In other words, we are  intervening because there is that hypothesis of the war  spreading to the north and to the south -- toward Krajina in the  north, we will come to this in a while -- and toward the south,  the Muslim areas in the south. It is because of these risks  that we are there.    [Sinclair] But is the process started by NATO -- we are  going  to come back to this at great length because the program is  dealing exclusively with this subject -- is the process started  by NATO this week, is there a risk that we are taking on?  [sentence as heard]    [Leotard] It is important to know that, in this part of the  world, there are no policies that do not involve risk. So we  have to look at this situation very seriously, first of all, and  with courage and lucidity. Seriously, because people have been  killed. I remind you that 200,000 people have died throughout  the territory of the former Yugoslavia, there are 4 million  refugees, tens of thousands of people who have been displaced,  who are living in enclaves today. With courage, because I think  we have to assess and accept a certain number of risks, which  come from our firm attitude. And then, of course, with lucidity  -- aware that the situation is extraordinarily complex and that  it involves methods on our part, and on the part of all  Europeans for that matter.    [Sinclair] So before further discussion of the matter,  Francois Leotard, the pictures. Let us immediately look again  at the film of the week. [passage omitted] Francois Leotard,  we will look at things in order, and first of all, of course,  the ultimatum. Why did it not seem possible yesterday, or even  seemed irresponsible, as Bernard-Henri Levy, the Abbe Pierre,  and Bernard Kouchner were told, why has it suddenly become  possible this week?    [Leotard] I think there are several things to be said in  response to your question. First, France itself, especially  since April: We have kept asking for a certain number of  international measures. We are not alone in this matter. We  belong to coalitions: Europe, NATO, and of course the United  Nations. So we have asked for intervention several times within  these organizations. [passage omitted]    The second reason is that bit by bit attacks on the UN  Protection Force [UNPROFOR] have increased. So we were were  getting bogged down. The reason for our presence was to give  humanitarian aid, and that aid was itself being hindered.    The third reason is that there was a disagreement, it is  true  and I must say it here, about the very idea of what was meant by  air strikes. We have heard a lot of unclear or vague things --  this is normal in discussion. We have always asked for air  support -- that is to say, an air presence -- to enable aid  tasks to be carried out. Others have said we have to go further,  we have to strike systematically, and sometimes in depth,  sometimes even in Serbia itself, against those fighting us. But  that is not our mandate. We have not declared war on one of the  three factions. But we are going to declare war [as heard]. So  you have to realize that what was difficult yesterday because  we, France, were not understood, is better accepted today,  because the French position, in particular at the last NATO  meeting, was accepted by the Americans, and understood by our  allies. [passage omitted]    [Sinclair] Will you designate the aggressor today?    [Leotard] It is more complicated than it was yesterday. Of  course, it is the Serbs besieging the town in Sarajevo, for  example. We have to say things clearly. Elsewhere, as you will  see, it is Muslim Bosnians surrounding Croat zones, so it has  become more complex.    [Sinclair] But you are not equating them? Because the  expression the belligerents has always been...    [Leotard, interrupting] No, I am not equating them. What  happened in the beginning was the desire of Greater Serbia, of  the Serbian leaders, to spread their influence, to gain  territory by violence. That is what we should never have  accepted. Never have accepted.    We must tell those people who keep saying that we must  withdraw, I mean to say, sometimes for a minimum, minor, modest  effort, at any rate at the start, one can prevent a larger  catastrophe. And this is absolutely the thesis we are trying to  develop. Let's try to stop the war now, because tomorrow we  won't be able to stop it any more.    [Sinclair] Saying to oneself at the same time, let's stop it  now but, perhaps, we could have stopped it earlier.    [Leotard] Perhaps we could have stopped it earlier. [passage  omitted] We must stick to the same course, because we are  involved in a trial of strength, with people who today respect  only threats. So we must carry these threats through. [passage  omitted]    This is just to show that the existing forces, including  French planes, are constantly taking photographs which we need  and targets have already been established. Everyone must know  we have all this and we will use it.    [Sinclair] So when we talk about bombing artillery pieces,  it  is really these artillery pieces here that we see [points to  map] and which are approximately how many, 250 or 300?    [Leotard] Now, between 250 and 300, if you add pieces that  are really heavy artillery mortars of 120 mm or mortars of 80  mm, which are very hard to detect because they are small  weapons. And it was probably a 120 mortar, you remember, which  caused the drama, the tragedy, of the market of Markale.    [Sinclair] General Cot, you are in Zagreb, live from Zagreb  with us. Thank you very much for being with us. We can see you  and we can hear you. On the ground, the Serbs have timidly  started to hand pieces of artillery over to the UNPROFOR. For  you, is that encouraging or, on the contrary, do you think that  this is not enough? Two days ago, 13 pieces of artillery were  reportedly handed over. Today, for instance, nothing has come  as yet. Are you rather optimistic or pessimistic?    [Cot] If you allow me, before I go into figures concerning  guns, I would like to tell you what I think about what the  minister has just said. I think that the tragedy of 5 February  was a genuine trauma on the ground, as I could see for myself  the following day, and throughout the world.    Two initiatives have emerged. The first, about which you  talked at length, if I understood well, is that of NATO. The  other is what is happening on the ground, and as early as the  following day, through the negotiations we conducted  immediately: we managed to obtain a cease-fire, as you know,  before NATO's decision, and that cease-fire is being heeded. We  also managed to have observers sent there and to start gathering  pieces of artillery.    I think, I sincerely hope, that these two initiatives will  be  complementary, and I do hope that the 120 mm shell on the market  place could be the beginning of a process leading to the  opposite of 1914 Sarajevo, if you like. An example closer to us  could be that of Ouvea [site of clashes between police and  freedom fighters in New Caledonia in 1988].    As you rightly put it, it seems to me that when too much  becomes too much, on the ground, one must understand that it is  necessary to break out of this absurd situation. I believe that  NATO's initiative, which I support, of course, and the one we  took on the ground, that is continuing to negotiate in a  determined fashion, are complementary.    [Sinclair] Negotiations on the ground are continuing.  General Soubirou, a French general and Michael Rose's deputy,  was in Pale today to negotiate with the Serbs. So what has come  out of the negotiations today? Can you tell us? Are we in a  process where we are moving towards the handover of Serb  artillery to your forces, the UNPROFOR forces, or is there a  feeling that things are getting very bogged down?    [Cot] Yes, I think we have not started off so badly, since,  as I told you, the cease-fire has been respected for three days.  But it is true that the items that we have collected so far are  only a minute fraction of the total that the Serbs have, since  we have today 20 antiaircraft guns from the Serb side, and 10  items from the Bosnian side. But I think we will continue, and  we must certainly keep up pressure, and even step it up. That  is why I went to see General Mladic, who is the commander of the  Serbs, in the mountains of northwest Bosnia yesterday, and got  him to agree to come to Sarajevo next Tuesday, 15 February, to  the airport, and I am going to ask General Delic, his  counterpart with the Bosnians, to come too, because I think that  the level of negotiations, headed at the moment by General  Soubirou, is too low, and I am glad to have got these two chiefs  to meet. I will be there too, with General Rose, and we really  intend to keep up strong pressure.    [Sinclair] General, people remember your anger when you  said: We are ready for military intervention, and are sorry  that we don't have the means to respond when the UN forces are  attacked, and even spoke about your soldiers being humiliated.  Does the situation seem clearer to you today? Do you feel that  everyone fits their role better?    [Cot] Yes, I also said other things, but that is mainly what  has been remembered. Let me tell you that this morning I  received the decision by the Secretary General, Mr.  Butrus-Ghali, to delegate to Mr Akashi on the ground the right  to take the decision on possible use of air support throughout  the whole of Bosnia-Herzegovina, so I must be satisfied with  what I have done and I think...    [Sinclair, interrupting] Would that be done, General...    [Cot] ...this is more in keeping with the needs of the force  that has got itself into a more and more difficult situation, as  Mr. Leotard was saying.    [Sinclair] Would that be done at your request? That's to  say, would it be at the request of UNPROFOR that it would be  submitted to Mr. Akashi and then he would authorize the strike?  How would it happen exactly?    [Cot] That is indeed just what would happen. I would ask for  the use of aircraft, whether throughout Bosnia, as I have just  said, or for the case of Sarajevo today, and I would submit this  request to Mr. Akashi, who, taking into account those factors  that come under his competence, would make the decision himself,  which would make it possible to save a great deal of time.  That's to say, we could reduce it from about three hours --  that's the timescale we have found through our exercises up to  now -- to about half of that, or even less. So it is a very  important decision.    [Sinclair] A question to Francois Leotard, and also to you,  General Cot: What will happen if the withdrawal is incomplete,  that is if we see that each day, a small contingent -- if there  are any at all -- is handed over to UNPROFOR, and if, at the end  of the day, when the ultimatum expires, we have 80 or 120 pieces  of artillery out of the 250. What will we do? What will we not  do?    [Leotard] It is necessary for all, including the Serbs, to  know that we are extremely determined and that we intend to  succeed in this operation. If the conditions set by the  decision of Brussels are not met, the term used in the  resolution is: The batteries will be exposed to attack. It  will be up to us to decide when and how the attacks, the strikes  take place.    [Sinclair] That is to say, possibly, an extension of the  ultimatum?    [Leotard] No, on the contrary. NATO's decision points out  very clearly -- and it is exceptional for this type of decision  -- that the deadline would not be extended. Consequently, on  the evening of the 20th, everybody should know what can be  expected. It will be up to [pauses] ...of course, we are not  [pauses] ...having said that, what General Cot says is true: We  are not just outside, we are also inside the site, the theater,  as we say. There will be close cooperation with the forces on  the ground, General Rose, General Soubirou, General Cot, of  course, who will direct things, and this cooperation will enable  us to see how ground troops move toward the batteries, the  orders they receive, the reactions of those who may not want to  obey them, and then the decisions to be taken. But nobody  should question our determination. It should be obvious for  those who are listening to us.    [Sinclair] General, something that people are a bit worried  about here is that Serbian weapons are being deposited in the  barracks at Lukavica, in other words in a zone under Serbian  control. There have already been precedents when Serbs have  taken over weapons very close to them, left for them. Shouldn't  these locations be under the control of the NATO forces, and in  any case out of reach of the Serb forces?    [Cot] Yes, but all things are possible. Even if they are all  withdrawn from beyond the radius of 20 km, you could say that  they could be brought back later. I think this is a first step.  And I must say that what has been decided does not deal only  with a withdrawal beyond a radius of 20 km, but also regrouping  within the radius of 20 km, as long as the regrouping is under  UN control.    So I think these are reasonable guarantees.    [Sinclair] Today the Serbs, in particular General  Milovanovic, who is the chief of staff of the Serb forces in  Bosnia, are asking you to monitor the Muslim infantry in  Sarajevo. Might you consider this? Was this in the agreement?  That's to say, they are asking for another, extra guarantee?    [Cot] This is something different. First of all the pieces  of heavy artillery surrounding Sarajevo have to be regrouped or  pulled back, as we have just said. That is our first aim. Of  course there is no question of the Muslim forces taking  advantage of this to occupy the territory that will thus have  been liberated. That is where the interplay of forces on the  ground is extremely complex. It is like a game of spillikins in  a war situation. That's to say, you have to pick up one by one  the instruments of death around Sarajevo and, at the same time,  ensure the physical presence of soldiers on the ground, reassure  the population -- which General Rose did yesterday, going out  onto the streets, and which we, our soldiers, do every day, and  at the same time see that those inside the siege don't benefit  from it, because that would again be seen as a factor of  violence or aggression -- that they don't benefit from the  situation in order to regain ground which will have to be  regarded from a diplomatic or political point of view.    What is important in what we were just saying is that there  is no military solution, properly speaking. I hope we will  speak about the peace plan, political and diplomatic solutions,  but everyone is well aware that we are in a situation where  there are no military solutions, properly speaking.    [Sinclair] A last question, perhaps, general: It has been  said very often that air strikes are not of much use if there  are not enough men on the ground to occupy the positions  formerly held by the Serb forces, as we were saying. Has  anything changed in this line of thinking, or was it wrong, or  are you saying today: We do indeed need more men, and you are  asking for more men?    [Cot] I think the scenario you have just described, namely  that we make air strikes and we have to reoccupy the ground, has  been too strongly influenced by the Gulf war, where by and large  that was the scenario. But here, indeed we don't have the means  to reconquer in the military sense what has been got rid of on  the Serb side. I don't think that's the aim, actually. We  don't have the means to do it and, as Mr. Leotard said, we are  not in a war situation. We are there to take over control of  these weapons. I am sure that the pressure is strong enough for  this to be done, but I don't think we can talk about military  operations, about reconquering ground that has in a way been  cleared by air strikes. This is a line of thinking that does  not accord with the nature of the force, nor with its mandate as  Mr. Leotard said just now, at the beginning of the program.    [Sinclair] Francois Leotard, I would like to ask you the  same question, because it often was an argument used by  politicians, including the present government, who said: We,  France, have done our best, but there are not enough of us on  the ground because other countries have not followed us  sufficiently.    [Leotard] Yes, of course. I would like to comment on what  General Cot has just said. He is totally right. We are in a  situation which is the exact reverse of the Gulf war. May I  remind you that during the Gulf war we wore khaki, if I may put  it this way, not white and blue. We had a front, a genuine  front. There was an opponent, a named opponent, and so on.  Here, we are not in a war situation. We have not declared war  on anyone. We are painted in blue, i.e. we are men of peace,  and, in fact, the situation of Sarajevo is reproduced elsewhere,  with other elements, with different ethnic and religious  elements. I believe that it is necessary to be aware of this.    To the precise question you are asking, namely, will more  men  be necessary to control the 20 km zone, unfortunately, the  answer is yes. I say unfortunately, because we have made a  significant effort and we do not intend to step up that effort  as long as others don't. Of course, military officers themselves  say some 1,500 men should be added to bring the situation more  under control. Again, we must bear in mind that we are not in a  situation of military conflict, which makes things very complex  indeed.    [Sinclair] A last question, General Cot, and I will let you  go. Do you think that the Serbs' capacity for retaliation has  been overestimated, or is it significant, even after air  strikes, and are you worried for civilians and your soldiers?    [Cot] We have not over [pauses] ...we know the capacity of  the Serbs. The Serbs have inherited the material of the  Yugoslav People's Army, as you know. I don't know how we could  estimate today what would be left of the guns after air strikes,  this would take us too far into the debate, but I think that the  Serbs have the means to retaliate, indeed, not only around  Sarajevo, but throughout Bosnia, especially against humanitarian  workers, which is another matter. There is no doubt that there  is a contradiction there which will have to be assumed, between  the mandate in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is essentially, if not  totally, a humanitarian one, and the new attitude which we will  take on. It is a genuine problem.    [Leotard] We must understand, Anne Sinclair, if you allow  me,  that on the very day these air strikes begin -- if they ever  begin -- the airport will be closed. At the moment, 80 percent  of the food reaching Sarajevo comes from the airport. We would  be in a totally different situation, and a very difficult one to  manage. At the moment, there are some 3,000 men there,  including more than 2,000 French soldiers. It would be a  complex situation.    [Sinclair] General, thanks a lot for being with us live from  Zagreb. I let you go back to your men, your battalions, your  mission which will become very complicated over the next few  weeks. Thanks a million for being there, and good luck.    [Cot] Thank you, Madame.    [Sinclair] Before talking about the Bosnian problem as a  whole, I would like to play for you a recording of Alija  Izetbegovic, the president of the country, of this country that  has suffered too much, as was said yesterday at the opening of  the Lillehammer Olympic Games. He does not speak often; he has  not spoken since the ultimatum. He agreed to do so for the  "Sept sur Sept" team out there, and he did it in French:    [Begin Izetbegovic recording; Izetbegovic speaks in halting  French, reading from a script] Dear French friends. The France  that fought in the resistance has just shown Sarajevo the path  of honor and courage. I thank the French authorities and the  French people for this. Alas! It has taken tens of thousands  of deaths for the European conscience to wake up. I hope that  this is not just a burst of indignation, and that from now on  Europe will defend in full one of the peoples which make it up,  and the values which lie at its roots.    But if an ultimatum has been issued to the Serbs to withdraw  their guns, you must know that the siege of Sarajevo has not  been lifted. Five metres, 500 metres from here is Mount  Trebevic. For two years sharpshooters have been killing  children, women, pedestrians, a whole innocent people, every day.    Will the Serbs be allowed, in exchange for the withdrawal of  their guns, to continue to surround 300,000 men and women? A  first step has been taken, but it does not give us back our  freedom. More steps need to be taken, in Sarajevo and  elsewhere, to enable us to live again at last.    Gorazde, Zepa, Srebrenica, Maglaj, Tesanj, Mostar and the  other towns have been besieged and starved for months; Tuzla is  being shelled. Is Sarajevo going to be saved, and not those  towns?    If Europe, and the international community, really make the  aggressor retreat from around Sarajevo, will they stop there?  Will they consider that they have done enough for  Bosnia-Herzegovina? We in Bosnia-Herzegovina are resisting a  new fascism. This curse is not threatening my country alone.  Tomorrow it can invade Europe and the former USSR. Will the  Serbs obtain by negotiation what they were unable to grab by  war? The end of Bosnia, recognition of their conquests, and  absolution for their crimes?    French friends, I ask you to continue your support for the  freedom of Sarajevo and of Bosnia-Herzegovina as a whole. Thank  you. [end recording] [passage omitted]    [Leotard] I mean to say that the other Europeans, the  international community should pull their weight as much as  France. We now have nearly 9,000 French soldiers throughout the  theater, if I can say that, on the Adriatic, on the Danube, in  Zagreb, in Sarajevo. We are the country that has contributed  most.    [Sinclair] Nine thousand out of...    [Leotard] Out of nearly 30,000 now. There are 30 nations  there. So, we are the country that has pulled its weight most.  The others must pull their weight too. We have asked for this,  from the United States, of course, but also and above all, from  the Europeans. It's up to the Europeans to understand that it  is partly their future which is at stake on this territory.  [passage omitted]    [Leotard] And then, Tuzla, where we are trying and we are  hoping to open the airport, which would allow humanitarian aid  to reach the north of Bosnia. And there, also, the Serbs are  opposing this for the time being. I personally hope that we can  also have the air protection force used around Tuzla, so that we  can reopen the airport of Tuzla and get humanitarian aid into  that part of Bosnia. [passage omitted]    [Sinclair] Could we make the following concession to the  Bosnians: grant them, in a revised peace plan [pauses] ...this  is what the Americans advocate, that is, the revision of the  peace plan in favor of the Bosnians, and to give them access to  the sea, access to the Sava.    [Leotard] Now, I think it's a demand that is not without  legitimacy. It's just that the European Union has now drawn up  a plan to which the three parties involved have more or less  agreed. We have to work on this now and try to perfect it and to  improve it. That is what the Americans are asking us to do to  ensure that it is not an unfair solution. All injustice in that  part of the world, in that part of the European continent, will  lead to further violence...    [Sinclair, interrupting] You mean too unfair.    [Leotard] Too unfair. And so, this is a demand which needs  to be studied but which is, you see, very difficult. Croatia  has already said it will never accept the division of its  Dalmatian territory, its Dalmatian coast. So this is very  difficult. And in the north, of course, the Serbs also are  opposed to their corridor there, which is about 8 km wide, being  cut as well.    [Sinclair] Here we must remember that the peace plan  envisages the division into three republics -- Serb, Croat and...    [Leotard, interrupting] And Bosnian Muslim.    [Sinclair] Bosnian Muslim -- of all of Bosnia.    [Leotard] We must remember that there are enclaves, you see.  Those three enclaves which are in the east of Bosnia, which are  Muslim and are within Bosnia.    [Sinclair] In a confederation of whatever size.    [Leotard] Of course, you have to see the initial peace plan  as a starting point. That's to say, the basic idea is respect  of the international frontiers of Bosnia, which have been  recognized by the international community, and the coexistence  of its peoples within this territory. This is really something  that we can hope for, and for which we have to put on pressure.  Because you can't imagine states that are enemies taking this  shape. It is inconceivable. You would have dozens of corridors  and we Europeans know what that means from the last war. So  these people absolutely have to get on together to cooperate in  the shape of a confederation, so that they can exchange goods,  exchange populations, so that there should not be dozens of  ghettos, making as many seats of violence, of Gaza Strips, as  has sometimes been said, from where terrorist actions, or acts  of despair might originate. So it is a very difficult task for  diplomats, and I think public opinion should encourage this, and  that of course this peace treaty should not be based on an  injustice.    [Sinclair] What is special about this war in former  Yugoslavia is that it is not just a civil war, with all its  horrors -- and the siege of Sarajevo, this terrible civil war --  but it is also the first time for 50 years that we have seen an  attempt at ethnic cleansing, in other words towns and villages  completely either massacred, or looted and raped, or where in  any case the inhabitants have been deported to other areas so as  to make homogenous areas. This is what has been done by the  Serbs, mainly.    [Leotard] This is what it is essential to reject. [passage  omitted] The truth is that we have a lot of educational work to  do. Do you have French people, Italians, Spaniards ready to die  in large numbers, in a war, so that the previous situation can  be restored? That is the difficulty. We must not hide it.  [passage omitted]    [Sinclair] Let's broaden the problem a bit to all of East  Europe. We have seen the sinister Zhirinovskiy today ready to  send battalions of volunteers to fight in Serbia. Zhirinovskiy  makes a lot of noise, but is not in power, but won't the  nationalists he is whipping up force Boris Yeltsin to take this  overexcited nationalism in Russia into account?    [Leotard] This is one of the aspects of this crisis, that  they are Slavs, and of course the Serbs are Slav and Orthodox,  and there is a sort of human and intellectual fraternity with  the Russians, and President Yeltsin has to deal with an  opposition, as you said, in the opposition -- that is to say  Zhirinovskiy, who is very nationalistic, chauvinistic,  xenophobic and fascist -- you can't call it anything else,  because unfortunately that is the best definition of what he  stands for.    So we must both help Yeltsin to resist this nationalist  opposition, not allow an anti-Russian, or anti-Slav, attitude to  take hold, which would be quite out of place, certainly for  France, and at the same time we have to make sure that this  poison, this plague, that Europe saw 50 years ago, does not  spread, as is unfortunately the case in Belgrade now. How else  can we describe the people currently in Belgrade? And some of  their associates in Bosnia. So the democracies have to be on  guard to ensure that the values in their inheritance -- respect  for human rights, elections, the right to come and go, the  dignity of the human person -- should all be defended here. If  it is not defended here, how can it be defended elsewhere?    [Sinclair] So if it is defended here, won't this create a  European precedent? What will we do the day that this or that  minority in Russia or elsewhere in East Europe is either  oppressed or oppressor?    [Leotard] Mr. Balladur, the French prime minister, has put  forward an initiative, which I think quite exemplary, as to what  the French position, and, I was going to say, French  intelligence, could be in that part of Europe. It is called a  stability plan, a stability pact, which is to examine the  problem of frontiers and the problem of minorities before crises  arise, as a preventative measure. [passage omitted] I think we  are faced with a resurgence of nationalism and ethnic or,  unfortunately, religious demands, which are fatal for Europe.  We fought this for decades, and they are coming back, and you  will see that the borders here are the former borders that are  very, very old. [passage omitted]    [Sinclair] Mr. Leotard, there are exactly 10 days left, or a  bit more, since it is next Sunday at midnight that the  cease-fire [as heard] will expire. Do you hope things will  move, that the Serbs will hand their heavy artillery over to  UNPROFOR? Are you hoping for a positive outcome?    [Leotard] I am hoping with all my heart that things happen  in  the way we intend. [passage omitted] I just want to say that  there are people around today who are warmongers, who say: The  only thing to do is to make war. But that isn't true. There  are people on the other hand who say: We mustn't look, it's too  awful, it isn't our business. That isn't true either. In fact  we are faced with a reality that is going to affect us, which  can affect us, and France's honor lies in being there with her  soldiers. [passage omitted]</p>

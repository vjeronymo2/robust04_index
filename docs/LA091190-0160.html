			<p><P> September 11, 1990, Tuesday, Valley P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> ROONEY TO AID VICTIMS OF VANDALS  </P> <P> Entertainer Mickey Rooney offered today to pay for the repainting of a black  couple's Agoura Hills home, which was vandalized last month by intruders who  painted red swastikas and racial epithets on the walls.  </P> <P> It was the second time in two years that vandals had broken into the home of  the Szebelski L. Freeman, 68, and his wife Matilda, 69.  </P> <P> In addition to spray-painting the walls, the vandals slashed chairs and  curtains, destroyed photographs and appliances, overturned an aquarium and  placed the fish in a bowl filled with manure, causing about $30,000 worth of  damage.  </P> <P> In a statement released by his publicist today, Rooney offered to pay for the  cleanup.  </P> <P> "It sickens me to see people like the Freemans suffering this way. We fought  World War II to wipe swastikas off the face of the Earth. I think everyone has  to do his or her share to see that hate crimes are wiped out as well."  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 11, 1989, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Profile of AT&amp;T Stockholders Changing: Retirees still make up the biggest  block of American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. shareholders, but those who  have bought stock since the Bell System breakup tend to be younger and more  interested in growth, the company says in a new survey. AT&amp;T is the most  widely held stock in the nation at 2.6 million shareholders. Among survey  findings: 70% of shareholders are 50 or older; 28% are under 50, compared with  15% in 1983; and shareholders still rate security as their top reason for  owning AT&amp;T stock, although growth has moved into second place.  </P></p>

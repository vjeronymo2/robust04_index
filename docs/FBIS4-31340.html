			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, June 3 (CTK) -- Matica Slovenska  [Heritage Foundation], the Slovak cultural organization which  fosters national legacy, has welcomed that the law which was to  allow the bilingual place names of the towns and villages  inhabited by ethnic minorities had not been adopted today.    "The bill wanted to base the place names in the ethnically  mixed Slovak territory on the old Hungarian and  Horthyite-Hungarian names. In doing so, it would provide a basis  for the official and territorial autonomy and further directive  Magyarisation of the Slovak south, regardless of the views of  the local people, including more than one million of Slovaks,"  Stanislav Bajanik, a Matica secretary, told radio today. South  Slovakia was annexed by Hungary between 1938 and 1945 when  Admiral Miklos Horthy ruled in Hungary.    Bajanik said it was a satisfaction to Matica's activities  that the law had not been passed. He praised the deputies "who  understood the causes and consequences of the  Magyarisation-aimed steps." According to Bajanik, Matica is  ready to help settle the language order in Slovakia as it has  prepared a draft law on protecting the state language which  would resolve the rights and duties of the Slovak and minority  languages.</p>

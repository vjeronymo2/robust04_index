			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Blantyre, Feb 21 (AFP) -- Malawi's Defence Minister  Wilfred Mponela has disclosed that 2,730 of the country's feared  Young Pioneer force, recently disbanded, are in neighbouring  Mozambique, emerging from a civil war.    Major General Mponela said that military sources in  Mozambique had indicated that the Pioneers are in camps held by  the formerly rebel Mozambique National Resistance (Renamo), the  semi-official DAILY TIMES reported Monday [21 February].    The new figure contradicts a previous official version of  between 200 and 500 Pioneers still unaccounted for.    Michael Chimutu, the head of the disbanded Pioneers, long  considered a private army operating for Malawi's ageing  President Kamuzu Banda, last week told journalists and diplomats  that 500 Pioneers remained unaccounted for.    Minister of State John Tembo often puts the figure at 200.    Mponela, who officially retired from the army on Friday and  was appointed defence minister in December after a 30-year  career, said the disarmament of the Pioneers, codenamed  Operation Bwezani (Return), will continue because "the nation  wants peace."    He said the army will ensure that May 17 general elections  are held in a peaceful atmosphere. The army will not be allowed  to vote in the first free poll since independence in 1964 to  prevent it from being divided into factions.    "Soldiers cannot vote because they are non-partisan,"  Mponela  stated, according to the DAILY TIMES.    The chairman of the disarmament committee, Lieutenant  General  Mankin Maulana, last week expressed the military's concern that  arms retrieved from the Pioneers do not tally with inventories.    Malawi and Mozambique have agreed to cooperate in the  repatriation of the Pioneers. Banda's government was officially  neutral in the Mozambican civil war that followed independence  in 1975 and ended with a peace pact in October 1992.</p>

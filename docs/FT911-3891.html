			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Farm deal upsets Falklanders: Is the unloved FIC being paid too much? John Barham reports WHEN the Falkland Islands government announced on April 6 that it planned to buy out the last big absentee landowner left on the islands, it probably expected the deal to be received as a triumph of local power over the unloved Falkland Islands Company (FIC). However, opposition to the sale quickly began to grow as purchase terms for the four FIC farms emerged. Less than a week after the announcement, a straw poll by the local radio station found that 36 of the 50 people questioned rejected the deal. The government has agreed to pay Pounds 4.85m for the farms, which cover 974,000 acres of prime land in the southern half of East Falkland. Other payments raise the net price to Pounds 5m, or 13 per cent of government revenues. Most critics focus on the price FIC won for the farms. Mr Bill Luxton, a councillor who bitterly opposes the acquisition, said: 'It's not the concept that is wrong. I'm all for getting the land out of the hands of FIC.' But he argues that the farms and their 200,000 sheep have been grossly overvalued, claiming that the Falklands have handed Anglo United, FIC's troubled parent company, a Pounds 3m 'donation'. Mr Gerard Robson, one of the councillors who negotiated with Anglo, conceded that 'with the present state of wool prices you can't argue that this is a brilliant deal.' The farms' only significant product is wool. Wool prices have crashed to a 50-year low and no farmer is making money. So the Falklands should have received a discount from FIC instead of paying a premium. However, FIC says it had another potential buyer who had offered as much as Pounds 6m for the farms. Officials admit that covering losses at the farms, which produced 29 per cent of last year's wool output of 2,591 tonnes, will raise the acquisition price to Pounds 8m over the next three years. Mr Derek Howatt, chief financial officer, says the purchase may push the government into an operating deficit this year. Still, the legislative council is unlikely to reject the sale. Mr Robson, like most councillors, says it is worth paying a premium to wrest control of the islands' economy from FIC, which, established by royal charter in 1852, wielded almost feudal powers in the Falklands until the 1970s. Naturally, many people are questioning the wisdom of making the government a big landowner at a time when state economic intervention is being rolled back all over the world. However, Mr Ronald Sampson, the government chief executive, says: 'We will take a very hard commercial line in running the business. But we will not announce redundancies in the medium term. If (the farms) have no long term future they will be allowed to go to the wall.' The government can also be criticised for failing to loosen FIC's grip over the islands' economy. Its shipping, retail and service operations remain intact. These sectors are probably the most lucrative part of FIC's operation. Although Anglo United refused a government offer to buy FIC outright, it decided to give the government 'for no consideration' a half-share in its subsidiary Darwin Shipping. Darwin is a charter company that handles nearly all the islands' foreign trade. By making the government a partner, FIC probably expects it will be less anxious to break its oligopoly. Strangely, the sale has highlighted the islanders' lack of self-confidence. The Falklands remain very much a colony with appointed officials such as Mr Sampson running local government. All big decisions must first be approved in London, sometimes at cabinet level. British officials say in private that the islanders often fail to grasp complex issues, such as the land deal, fully. For their part, islanders fear that the British government subordinates their interests to its own political aims. Conspiracy theorists suspect that obscure geopolitical or vested interests were the 'real' reason behind the land sale. They say the government was suspiciously quick to accept a sale that may not be in the islands' best interests. The Falklands have grown rich quickly through the sale of fishing licences. This year licences will raise Pounds 23.7m for the treasury. The government had earlier convinced the islanders to save as much of the windfall as possible. But now it has agreed to a deal that will cost this year's budget surplus. Mr Ray Evans, a farmer, says: 'If they could only give a solid reason for paying such a high price, it would calm a lot of people.' But Mr Rodney Lee, once a farm hand and now the owner of a successful sheep farm, summarises the islanders' dilemma: 'I've done a lot of bowing and scraping in my time. We have been dictated to all our lives. All that ended after the (1982 Argentine) invasion. But we don't have many local people who are qualified to take complex decisions.'</p>

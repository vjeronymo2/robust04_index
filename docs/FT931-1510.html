			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / International Company News: Comparex earnings halved to DM15bn COMPAREX, the computer supplier wholly owned by BASF Group of Germany, saw profits after tax halved last year as hardware prices continued to fall in tough trading conditions. Turnover for the year totalled DM1.14bn, (Dollars 695m) about 9 per cent lower than last year and 6 per cent lower than forecast. Profits after tax were DM15m, half last year's total. The company said the result was satisfactory as profits margins in the computer industry had eroded steadily as prices fell. Comparex markets mainframe computers manufactured by Hitachi of Japan and peripherals of its own design. Computing services contributed 19 per cent of total revenues for 1992, 3 per cent up on the previous year.</p>

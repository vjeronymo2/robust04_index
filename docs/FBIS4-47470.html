			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by R.A. Andriyevskiy [New Chemical Problems </F> Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences, (Chernogolovka)] under  the ``Research Methods and Properties of Powder Materials  rubric''; received May 12,1993; UDC 539.2:620.7.018.45]    [Abstract] The article attempts to summarize information on  physico-mechanical and physico-chemical properties of  nanocrystalline refractory compounds (RCs), mainly powder  nanocrystalline materials (NMs) carbides, borides, nitrides,  oxides etc. in consolidated state. Data on film NMs are provided  for comparison. Data on hardness, which is among the most well  studied characteristics, are presented, along with manufacturing  methods, and analyzed. Residual porosity affects hardness: a  5%  TRiTchange of porosity changes its hardness by almost 50%.  Hardness also depends on grain size. There is a real possibility  of creating new superhard materials based on nanocrystalline  RCs, but it is necessary to find a reasonable consolidation  methods that will make it possible to obtain NMs with the  optimum grain size. The failure mechanism of such materials  remains virtually unknown. Information of the nature of grain  TRvTboundaries in NMs is mainly available for TiOCCDDCC2DD. The  boundaries are similar to those in regular large grain  materials. One of the most interesting characteristics of  refractory compounds based NMs is their superductility, but  studies of this phenomenon are in a rudimentary state. Data on  properties of nanocomposites have appeared in literature. Few  works deal with physical and physico-chemical properties of RCs  in nanocrystalline state. Among possible new applications of  nanocrystalline RCs is the technology of nanocrystalline hard  alloys WCCo with high hardness and wear resistance for making  microtomes and other critical products. It is concluded that  only first steps have been made in studying properties of  refractory compounds based NMs. Figures 3, tables 2, references  52: 21 Russian, 31 Western.</p>

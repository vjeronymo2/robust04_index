			<p><P> March 28, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> SAN FERNANDO WALKS OFF WITH WIN  </P> <P> Chatsworth High's Reed McMackin put his team in a bind Tuesday when he walked  San Fernando's first seven batters.  </P> <P> McMackin (3-2) was removed after the seventh walk and San Fernando went on to  score six runs in the inning en route to an easy, 9-2 Northwest Valley  Conference victory at Chatsworth.  </P> <P> The game was called after six innings because of darkness.  </P> <P> Chatsworth (8-3, 3-3 in conference play) used four different pitchers --  McMackin, Dennis Emslie, Brett Thompson and Mitch Root -- but none could shut  down the Tigers (8-1-1, 5-1).  </P> <P> San Fernando's John Najar (3-0), a senior right-hander, threw a one-hitter and  hit his sixth home run in the fourth inning.  </P> <P> "To still pitch as terrible as I did and only allow one hit was amazing to me,"  said Najar. "The mound here is sloped, and I was throwing a lot of sidearm  pitches. It wasn't pretty."  </P> <P> Najar hit five Chatsworth batters, but his fastball was effective enough to  keep the Chancellors throwing their helmets in disgust. ERIC SHEPARD  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 9 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and  Foreign Minister Qian Qichen had a working meeting here today  with Han Sung-chu, minister of foreign affairs of the Republic  of Korea (ROK).    Han briefed Qian on the latest developments centering on the  nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula.    Stating China's point of view on the current situation, Qian  pointed out that, with the efforts of the parties concerned, not  long ago the development on the issue was in a positive  direction.    But recently, he continued, due to disputes between the  International Atomic Energy Agency and the Democratic People's  Republic of Korea about the inspection of the replacement of  fuel rods the situation has taken a sudden turn, and the Chinese  side has shown much concern about this.    He stated that the Chinese side advocates two basic targets  for efforts to solve the issue: the denuclearization of the  Korean peninsula and the safeguarding of peace and stability  there.    He said that these targets are in the fundamental interests  of all the countries in Northeast Asia.    Facing the current difficulty, Qian pointed out, it is  particularly necessary for the concerned parties to keep calm  and restraint, and not to close the door to negotiations rashly.    He stated, "We call on all the parties directly concerned to  make further efforts to start talks so as to leave room and keep  possibilities alive for the settlement of the issue."    Qian pointed out that sanctions can not help solve the  issue;  on the contrary, sanctions may lead to results that none of the  concerned parties is willing to see.    Han arrived here yesterday evening on a working visit.</p>

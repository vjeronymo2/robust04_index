[passage omitted] Clinton  summed up the outcome of the meeting after the lunch. He was  followed by Vaclav Havel, who spoke on behalf of the Visegrad  Group. Vaclav Havel said:    [Begin Havel recording] We are living in a time of dramatic  search for a new order, in which no one will be subjugated or  endangered, and which will enable all European peoples and  states to enjoy an atmosphere of peaceful cooperation.    Our meeting in Prague today is proof that the United States  of America and NATO are well aware of the great importance that  stability, security and peace in central Europe have for peace  throughout Europe and for the security of the United States.    We welcome the Partnership for Peace proposal as a good  point  of departure in NATO's quest for a new identity as a true  stabilizing core of European security. We also appreciate that  Partnership for Peace allows individual approaches to different  countries. At the same time it rests with individual countries  on just how powerfully and quickly they move to give Partnership  for Peace a content that meets its interests and possibilities.    We want to do our utmost to ensure that our partnership will  result in full NATO membership because we do not see it as a  substitute but as a first step toward joining NATO. We want to  join NATO because we share the civilization values it protects,  and because we want to take part in their protection.    We are well aware that it is neither possible nor desirable  to isolate Russia. We are, however, independent states, and we  decide ourselves about our affiliations and our orientation.    As we agreed during conversations with the representatives  of  central European nations, those who are taking part in this  meeting in Prague, our countries have very similar views on the  issues I have just mentioned. This surely is a gratifying  circumstance, and it is to the benefit of us all.    In closing, please allow me to express my firm belief that  this gathering has become an important landmark on the road to  the new, democratic and truly peaceful Europe, sharing firm and  natural ties with the North American continent.    The city of Yalta went down in history as a symbol of the  division of Europe. I would be happy if today, the city of  Prague could emerge as a symbol of Europe standing in alliance.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Differences Inside Socialist Party </F> Leadership Over Decision To Announce Secession"]    [Text] Aden, AL-HAYAH -- An authoritative Yemeni Socialist  Party [YSP] source revealed yesterday that the "announcement of  the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Yemen and the  separation from the united state announced on 22 May 1990 has  provoked a dispute inside the YSP leadership. A wing led by the  party's northerners like Jarallah 'Umar and Yahya al-Shami has  voiced reservations about this step. This is in addition to Dr.  Yasin Sa'id Nu'man, chairman of the YSP secretariat."    The source said: "Northerners view the announcement of the  establishment of a separate republic in the south as a serious  matter which should be referred to the party's leading and  grassroots committees -- which has not been done, as 'Ali Salim  al-Bid took the secession decision single-handedly during his  presence in Hadhramaut, his birthplace." The source pointed out  that the "YSP, which has always stressed that it is a unionist  party, cannot become secessionist now."    Dr. Yasin Nu'man refused to speak to any media services,  insisting on secluding himself at his home in Aden in protest at  al-Bid's step. A number of YSP leaders have asked al-Bid to  hold an extraordinary Central Committee meeting to address this  serious situation.    AL-HAYAH has learned from leading YSP sources opposed to  al-Bid's opinion that "the YSP leader is refusing to hold such a  meeting."    Rashid Muhammad Thabit, member of the YSP Central Committee  and one of the members opposed to al-Bid's announcement, has  said that "al-Bid violated the party's unity and acted  single-handedly with some oppositionist forces which are now  divided among themselves."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "km": "The State Wants Arms Exports To </F> Occasionally Remain a Secret"]    [Text] Prague--Although Industry and Trade Minister  Vladimir Dlouhy stated recently that the military material trade  policy of the Czech Republic is completely open, some arms  contracts are still veiled in secrecy.    Bretislav Gregr, director of the License Administration at  the Ministry of Industry and Trade, said that there are  exceptional instances of trade, about which it is not  appropriate to inform. "They are concealed from a third  country," he said. He refused to provide any more detail.    Bretislav Gregr stated that, last year, the Czech Republic  exported arms to 52 countries of the world. The value of the  exported military material is close to $167 million, which is  $17 million more than in 1992.    The greatest interest abroad is in aviation technology, the  main buyer of which is Egypt, and in handguns, which are  exported mostly to Turkey. Although the largest shipments of  military material go particularly to African and Arab countries  and Southeast Asian states, the Czech Republic has most arms  trade business partners in Europe.    Arms Imports remain low because the Defense and Interior  Ministries do not have funds sufficient for armament. Last  year, the Czech Republic imported arms and parts for military  technology from a total of 12 countries of the world. There  was, for instance, a shipment of special components for aviation  technology from the Bahamas.    Last year, the Czech Republic did not export any heavy  technology, like tanks, armored carriers, or artillery systems.  Nor was a single Tamara radiolocator exported, which has a good  name abroad.    On the other hand, Kuwait has bought a greater quantity of  the universal plastic explosive Semtex, which is used there to  eliminate the consequences of the Persian Gulf war.    Great Britain obtained a small quantity of Semtex, as did  several other states that are testing Semtex features to be more  successful in the struggle against terrorists who use this  explosive.</p>

			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Arts: A Winter's Tale - Theatre Adrian Noble's new production of The Winter's Tale at Stratford comes close to perfection. The play has always had its detractors, saying that it was good only in parts. In the 18th-century there were versions which omitted Leontes, the jealous king of Sicily, and his injured wife, Hermione, altogether. Recently I saw a version which cut out the part of Leontes' son, Mamillius. Such cutting and carping have always seemed to me to be wrong. Noble's production proves that they are wrong on stilts. Nothing is omitted. Everything that has ever been seen to be good in the play is there: it comes out as a perfect whole. The attention to detail, without distracting from the wider piece, is remarkable. It is often said that Leontes' jealousy when he decides that his wife is enamoured of Polixenes the king of Bohemia, comes on too suddenly and is therefore not credible. Here, as played by John Nettles, Leontes has all the marks of a man close to insanity. He drinks heavily at the opening reception, his speech becomes slurred and his behaviour violent and irrational. Quite clearly he is having a nervous breakdown. This initial burst of realism does not undermine the play's subsequent magic. On the contrary, it reinforces it. If Lear retreats into madness, Leontes backs out of it as the young lovers take over. Essential to the romantic shift are the designs by Anthony Ward. These rely heavily on the use of balloons: sometimes balloons galore as when Autolycus (Richard McCabe) descends from the flies using them as a slow-moving parachute, sometimes balloons restrained. Seven-year-old Mamillius plays on his own with a red balloon in a scene reminiscent of a famous short movie. Instead of the chorus spoken by Time to indicate the passing of 16 years, a paper arrives attached to another balloon. Perdita, the missing daughter of Leontes, is played by Phyllida Hancock, who has grown up with a rural accent in common with the setting. But the old shepherd also picked up a lot of gold when he stumbled across the abandoned infant. The sheep-shearing party is not just a bunch of rustics. There is enough money about to pay for decent entertainment. Between the court and the shepherds we have had the storm scene and the dumping of Perdita. Here is one of Shakespeare's strangest stage directions: 'Exit Antigonus, pursued by a bear.' Here the bear, like the back legs of the pantomime horse, ought to be credited. He has human characteristics in that he bends down and kisses the foundling before seeing Antigonus off. Towards the end we return to realism. When Polixenes discovers that his son is about to marry a shepherdess, he unmasks himself and forbids the wedding. It is a reminder of Leontes' behaviour at the start, but there is a difference. This is genuine anger, not the act of someone approaching madness. The final statue scene is done with Hermione at the front of the stage, her back to the audience. so that the audience watches the amazed faces of the court rather than wonders if Hermione will betray herself by twitching the odd muscle before time. But the rest of the production has been so good that the statue scene is less a dramatic climax than a fitting end. The ultimate pleasure, as always, is in seeing Paulina, delightfully played by Gemma Jones, betrothed to an equally urbane Camillo (Benjamin Whitrow).</p>

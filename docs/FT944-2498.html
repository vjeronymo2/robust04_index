			<p>941216 FT  16 DEC 94 / Ukraine abandons bond issue President Leonid Kuchma yesterday abandoned Ukraine's Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6bn) bond issue. The scheme, launched this spring by former President Leonid Kravchuk, had been criticised over the legality of selling bonds backed by Ukraine's industrial and natural resources. One MP also alleged the bonds were sold in the UK and Switzerland, with the revenue diverted to secret bank accounts. Mr Kuchma's decree dissolves the Ukrainian Credit Fund, which oversaw the sale of 400 bonds worth Dollars 25m each, and orders prosecutors to look into the corruption allegations. He also promised that 'all obligations' to holders would be met. The episode casts yet another shadow over Mr Kravchuk's last year in office. His prime minister during the last nine months, Mr Yefim Zvyahilsky, was indicted in November on embezzlement charges.</p>

			<p><P> August 20, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> YEUTTER OPTIMISTIC THAT JAPAN WILL END BAN ON RICE IMPORTS  </P> <P> U.S. Agriculture Secretary Clayton K. Yeutter today gave his Japanese  counterpart two bags of California rice and expressed optimism that Japan will  act this year to end its ban on imports of the grain.  </P> <P> Japan's refusal to open its rice market is one of the stickiest trade disputes  between the two economic superpowers, and Yeutter received no promises today.  </P> <P> Yeutter presented Tomio Yamamoto, the agriculture minister, with four pounds of  medium-grain California rice at the beginning of their talks. Yamamoto accepted  the rice with a smile and a word of thanks.  </P> <P> Yeutter later told a news conference that Japan could provide a great boost to  multilateral negotiations to liberalize international trade by acting quickly  to open its rice market to imports.  </P> <P> The four-year negotiations, under the auspices of the General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade, end in December. U.S. officials believe that exemptions  requested by individual nations for certain products such as rice reduce the  chances for overall success.  </P> <P> "I am cautiously optimistic that reason and good judgment will prevail in Japan  and that this nation will do its part" in the trade talks, Yeutter said at the  news conference.  </P> <P> Although Japan is the world's largest food importer, the government has  insisted on maintaining self-sufficiency in rice, its staple food, which sells  for several times the world market price. Only a limited quantity of imported  rice is allowed for use in processed food.  </P> <P> Yamamoto told Yeutter that rice "is more than an issue of concern to Japan. It  is a matter of life and death to us," Kyodo News Service reported.  </P> <P> Yeutter stressed that he envisioned Japan opening its rice market only  gradually. He said U.S. policy is to support the conversion of all import  restrictions to tariffs, which would then be lowered over time.  </P></p>

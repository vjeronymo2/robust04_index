"The events in August 1991 and in October 1993 are  complicated and extraordinary, with uneasy consequences. No one  can easily forget them," he told Interfax on Wednesday.    "The situation whereby the state is ruined, the president  thrown down and the parliament shelled, and all this is  forgotten is a bad example and a bad precedent," he said.    "In compensation for that, we must be given hope for  national  reconciliation which alone can justify such steps (the  termination of the trial of the 1991 coup leaders -- Interfax).  There can be no other justification. Such things are  unpardonable," said Gorbachev.    Commenting on ex-prisoner of Lefortovo Aleksandr Rutskoy's  statement, circulated on Wednesday, Gorbachev described it as  "responsible" and "reflecting serious intentions". Rutskoy  urged the Russian citizens to maintain peace and national accord.</p>

			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Pets at a premium THE ROVER in the garage may be insured, but what about the one at your feet? Pet insurance is the latest product to be given a marketing push by the insurance industry. The main danger is not that Tiddles will be grabbed by a cat burglar. The two biggest costs that can hit a pet owner are veterinary fees and the liability to others if your pet damages property. Indeed, under the Dangerous Dogs Act, owners of certain types of dog are required to have insurance to cover the cost of damages, in case the animal attacks someone. But just because you have a loveable labrador does not mean you need to be without third party insurance. If your dog ran into the road and caused an accident, for example, you could be liable for the damages. Jardine Insurance cites a more unusual case of an owner forced to pay compensation after his dog fell through an office ceiling in the middle of a business presentation. According to Jardine, however, by far the most common claims are for vet fees. Everyday matters such as vaccinations or spaying / castration are not normally covered; the policies are designed to protect against illnesses or broken limbs caused in road accidents. These can be expensive. The Association of British Insurers says that treatment for a broken leg could cost up to Pounds 300 for a cat and Pounds 1,000 for a dog. And veterinary medicine has advanced so far these days that a cocker spaniel even had a pacemaker fitted - at a cost of Pounds 800. More mundane diseases such as skin complaints can also be expensive to treat. There are a number of plans on the market. Jardine (021-633-3377) has a policy called PAWS (Pet Animal Welfare Scheme) which is backed by the RSPCA. Kate Parminter of the RSPCA says the society is in favour of pet insurance because it is a sign of responsible animal ownership. The PAWS plan starts with basic cover for dogs at Pounds 49.75 a year and Pounds 32.50 for cats. Payments rise for those living in Surrey, west Sussex, London or Northern Ireland and there is a giant dog supplement of Pounds 6 for breeds such as great Danes. Jardine also offers a 'moggies and mongrels' policy for non-pedigree pets at Pounds 39.95 a year for dogs and Pounds 29.95 for cats. Petplan (0800-282009) has a basic plan at Pounds 49.95 for dogs with a Pounds 7.50 discount for cats. More cover can be acquired through the standard plan (Pounds 57.50 a year) or the supreme plan (Pounds 67.50). The amount of cover varies per plan but in addition to vet fees and third party liability, pet owners can also receive: death benefit (if a pedigree pet is killed); advertising costs if the pet goes missing; and emergency kennel costs. For those aged over 60, Age Concern Insurance (0883- 346964) has launched a special scheme. For an annual premium of Pounds 45 for cats and Pounds 54 for dogs, vet fees are covered up to a total of Pounds 1,250. (Policyholders must pay the first 10 per cent, with a minimum of Pounds 20.) In addition, the policy covers boarding kennel fees should you have to go into hospital, recovery costs if you lose your pet and third party liability of up to Pounds 2m. Age limits normally apply - the PAWS plan, for example, will offer new policies to dogs aged between eight weeks and eight years. Cover is not limited to dogs and cats. Horses, which can involve their owners in enormous expense, tend to have special policies of their own. What if you have an exotic pet, such as a snake or a spider? Cliverton Insurance (0263-860388) specialises in this field, providing cover for creatures that other insurers (and most people) do not want to touch. Philip Woodley of Cliverton says he has insured pets as bizarre as Cayman alligators and scorpions. But a lot of the company's business comes from exotic birds, which are popular with thieves. Cover can be expensive; preventing a Pounds 1,000 Norwegian blue from becoming an ex-parrot can cost as much as Pounds 127.50 a year.</p>

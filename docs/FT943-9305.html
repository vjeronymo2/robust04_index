			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / Germans pass free time in 'free' toil West Germans spend 60 per cent more time working for nothing than in their paid jobs, according to the results of a statistics-stretching exercise, published yesterday. Official data on how people in the region pass their time show 47bn person-hours are consumed every year in paid employment, compared with 77bn in labouring unrewarded in the house, garden and toolshed. For reasons which are not immediately obvious, the latter figure includes holiday and sick leave from paid jobs. For equally obscure reasons, the federal statistics office has calculated that if bills for all this 'free' toil were presented, based on an average housekeeper's net pay of some DM11 an hour, the region's gross domestic product would expand by at least DM860bn (Pounds 355bn). Counting in the 'added value' generated by using the washing machine, car and other appliances, the figure inflates to DM1,000bn. The data constitute 'important and long-overdue recognition of the value of unpaid work to the community', Mr Hans Gunther Merk, office president, said in a statement accompanying the release of a brochure entitled, 'Where does the time go?' The brochure contains the initial findings from a study in 7,200 households during 1991 for which all family members aged 12 and above filled in a log of how they spent their time for two consecutive days. At a more accessible level, Mr Merk's team of analysts discovered that even west German men deliver 20 hours' free labour a week at home, while women in the traditionalist 'kids, kitchen and church' society work an average 35 hours unpaid. The average unrewarded working stint for the whole group was 28 hours a week. At the going rate for housekeepers this was worth DM2,550 per household per month. Leisure consumed an average five hours a day, with the media, including two hours in front of the TV set, accounting for half the total. Adults devoted an average 30 minutes to sport and play, 15 minutes to 'culture', and the rest to gossiping and entertaining. All in all, the study found employed men put in a nine-hour working day, including jobs at home, while home-bound married women with small children worked the same length of time but without the benefit of a pay packet.</p>

			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Charity's links with Natural Law party probed THE CHARITY Commission has launched a preliminary investigation into the activities of a UK-based charity because of its connections to a newly founded political party that has been actively campaigning for votes in today's general election. It emerged yesterday that the commission has approached the registered charity the World Government for the Age of Enlightenment of Great Britain for information about its links with the Natural Law party, which is fielding 310 candidates. The commission is trying to establish whether the charity may be in breach of regulations by straying too far into the field of political activity. Officials for the commission say the decision to conduct a preliminary investigation was made after the publication of advertisements in the national media and 'representations' from unnamed members of the public. They focus on full-page advertisements placed on separate days by the charity and by the Natural Law party. The charity is the local branch of a worldwide organisation focused on the teachings of the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, which has its headquarters at Vlodrop in the Netherlands. Funding for the Natural Law party advertisement came from the Association of the International World Plan Executive Council (AIWC), also based in the Netherlands, which is part of the Maharishi's international organisation. Mr Peter Warburton, a spokesman for the Natural Law party, said that many of the candidates of the party had practised the Transcendental Meditation programme founded by the Maharishi, but denied that the campaign was funded by the charity. He said that the NLP had paid for its advertisment with a loan from the AIWC and that the money 'will be repaid'. He described the AIWC as an international foundation set up to help to fund natural law projects around the world. The party had also received financial support at a national level from 'well-wishers who do not want their names revealed'. The NLP says it has spent Pounds 1m on its campaign since officially launching itself soon after the campaign started. The candidates for the NLP include Mr Leslie Davis and Mr Roger Chalmers, two doctors who were struck off the register last October after being found guilty of serious professional misconduct by the General Medical Council.</p>

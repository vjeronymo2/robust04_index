We will stand firm together with the large number of  Hong Kong people who love China and Hong Kong in the recovery of  Hong Kong's sovereignty, following the principles of `one  country, two systems,' and `Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong'  set out in the Basic Law."    At a ceremony to issue letters of appointment to advisers to  Hong Kong regional affairs held today, Zhou Nan said: "Since  Hong Kong entered the transitional period, Deng Xiaoping has  repeatedly stressed it is important for those Hong Kong people  who love China and Hong Kong to actively participate in all  sorts of social and political affairs. In the previous period,  according to suggestions made by Hong Kong people, the Chinese  Government has set up the Preliminary Work Committee of the  Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative  Region and has appointed two batches of advisers on Hong Kong  affairs. Facts have proved that these moves are conducive to  Hong Kong's prosperity and stability and are also an effective  way to encourage Hong Kong people to get involved in social and  political affairs in the transition period and to prepare them  for `administering Hong Kong'."    Zhou Nan pointed out: "The historic moment when Hong Kong  will return to the embrace of the motherland is drawing near.  Although there are people who have tried in every possible way  to create obstacles to the return of Hong Kong to its  motherland, their wishful attempts are doomed to failure. The  Chinese people, who have risen to their feet, will never allow  themselves to be ordered about and trampled upon any more."    Zhou Nan quoted Deng Xiaoping as saying: "Every son and  daughter of the Chinese people takes pride in their nation, no  matter what clothes they are dressed in and what position they  hold. Hong Kong people also have a sense of pride in their  nation. Hong Kong people can administer Hong Kong well. They  should have such confidence in themselves. Hong Kong's  prosperity has been brought about by Hong Kong people with  Chinese as the main body."    Zhou Nan stressed: "We must create such confidence: Without  British cooperation, we can still achieve a smooth transition  and administer Hong Kong well." He hoped the appointed advisers  on regional affairs would, together with the Hong Kong people,  make concerted efforts to remove all obstacles and work for a  smooth transition and a happier and more prosperous Hong Kong.</p>

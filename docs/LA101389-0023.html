The screws were inserted during Best's senior year in high  school to repair knee damage.  </P> <P> Best, who averaged 12.5 points and 4.4 rebounds last year, is returning after  missing the final two weeks last season for medical reasons unrelated to his  knee problem.  </P> <P> Also out are guard/forward Nelson Stewart and center Marty Dow. Stewart, a  junior transfer from College of Eastern Utah, had arthroscopic surgery two  weeks ago on both knees. No damage was found in the right but cartilage was  repaired in the left knee, trainer Mark Haines said. Stewart is expected to  practice later next week.  </P> <P> Dow, a 7-foot junior transfer from Northeastern Oklahoma A&amp;M, has a disc  ailment and received further treatment Thursday, Haines said. No date has been  set for Dow's return. CURT HOLBREICH  </P></p>

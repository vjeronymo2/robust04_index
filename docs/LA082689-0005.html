			<p><P> August 26, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> The Sheriff's Department received $625,205 Friday from federal authorities for  help in cracking an illegal methamphetamine ring.  </P> <P> The money represents the proceeds seized under federal law from the North  County drug manufacturing activities of Richard and Ronald Mason and Jodie  Jester, said U.S. Atty. William Braniff.  </P> <P> Braniff joined FBI special agent-in-charge Thomas Hughes in presenting the  check to Sheriff John Duffy at a news conference Friday. More than $3 million  in assets were seized, including $1.6 million in cash, two businesses and about  50 cars.  </P> <P> Sheriff John Duffy said his department's allotment will be used for  drug-awareness programs in the schools. The department is awaiting from federal  authorities an additional $19.6 million in seized assets, Duffy said.  </P> <P> Friday's share represents the largest single allocation the department has yet  to receive, Duffy said. Under the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984, the  Justice Department shares drug profits seized from traffickers with assisting  local police agencies.  </P> <P> "I'm delighted to have this $650,000 to put into the pot," Duffy said.  </P> <P> Assistant U.S. Atty. Donald Clausen said the seizure law is "one of the finest  weapons we can use."  </P> <P> "We completely destroy the capital of the organization," Clausen said.  </P> <P> The ring's undoing began in April, 1987, when two members were arrested by  sheriff's deputies in Valley Center. That incident led to the arrest and  indictment of 13 people, and also involved agents with the San Diego County  Integrated Narcotics Task Force, FBI and the Internal Revenue Service.  </P></p>

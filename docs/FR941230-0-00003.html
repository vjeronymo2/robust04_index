			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Areas of Application <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Three commenters requested that certain areas in the ``Rest of U.S.'' locality pay area be added as ``areas of application'' to other locality pay areas. One requested that Hartford County, CT, be added as an area of application to the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island, NY-NJ-CT-PA CMSA. Another requested that the Rhode Island cities of Providence, Pawtucket, Cranston, Warwick, West Warwick, and Newport be added as areas of application to the Boston-Worcester-Lawrence, MA-NH-ME-CT CMSA. The third commenter requested that the Massachusetts counties of Barnstable, Dukes, and Nantucket be added as areas of application to the Boston-Worcester-Lawrence, MA-NH-ME-CT CMSA. However, none of these locations meet all of the criteria set forth by the Federal Salary Council for establishment as areas of application for locality pay purposes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Federal Salary Council's criteria for making its recommendations on ``areas of application'' for the January 1995 locality payments, as outlined in an attachment to the Council's memorandum of September 20, 1994, provided that to be considered for county-wide areas of application, the affected county must_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Be contiguous to a pay locality. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Contain at least 2,000 GS-GM employees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Have a significant level of urbanization, based on 1990 Census data. A ``significant level of urbanization'' is defined as a population density of more than 200 per square mile or at least 90 percent of the population in urbanized areas. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Demonstrate some economic linkage with the pay locality, defined as commuting at a level of 5 percent or more into or from the areas in question. The areas in question are the contiguous county under consideration and the central counties (or in the case of New England, the central cores) identified by the Census Bureau for the process of defining the CMSA's or MSA's involved. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the case of Hartford County, criterion 4_that commuting into or from the central counties identified by the Census Bureau for the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island, NY-NJ-CT-PA CMSA be at a level of 5 percent_is not met. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to the Rhode Island cities requested as areas of application, under established policies, areas of application must comprise entire counties (except in cases where a Federal facility crosses pay area boundaries). Even if these individual cities could be considered, they would not meet criterion 1_that an area of application be contiguous to a pay locality. Also, they would not meet the 5-percent commuting standard under criterion 4. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the case of the Massachusetts counties requested as areas of application, none of the counties meets criterion 2. Nantucket and Dukes Counties do not meet criterion 4. Also, Nantucket County fails to meet criterion 1, since it is not adjacent to the Boston-Worcester-Lawrence, MA-NH-ME-CT CMSA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An agency commented that inconsistent application of criteria for areas of application could lead to unwarranted expansion of locality pay areas and agreed that it is in the best interest of the locality pay program to continue application of the criteria developed by the Federal Salary Council in 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Pay Administration <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Locality pay rates to be implemented in January 1995 for the San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose, CA CMSA are greater than interim geographic adjusted rates for 1995. Therefore, the San Francisco CMSA was deleted as an interim geographic adjustment (IGA) area by Executive order and is being removed from the definition of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> interim geographic adjustment area <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in &sect;531.101. A conforming change also is being made to ensure that an employee in San Francisco receiving a continued rate of pay under &sect;531.106 will not be adversely affected by the removal of San Francisco as an IGA area. This is accomplished by providing an exception in the rules governing the termination of an adjusted rate of pay for an employee receiving a continued rate in an area that was an IGA area when the continued rate first became applicable in January 1994. (See &sect;531.103(f)(1).) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The definitions of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> scheduled annual rate of pay <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  for purposes of computing interim geographic adjustments, special pay adjustments for law enforcement officers, and locality-based comparability payments in &sect;&sect;531.101, 531.301, and 531.602 have been revised to clarify that a rate of pay resulting from any of these provisions may not be used as the basis for computing the adjusted rate in question. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Comments Beyond the Scope of These Regulations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A professional association commented that locality payments in 1995 should be extended to Administrative Law Judges and other senior positions that do not automatically receive locality pay. These determinations are not within the purview of these regulations. However, on December 1, 1994, the Pay Agent informed heads of executive departments and agencies that 1995 locality payments would be extended to administrative law judges and various other senior positions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Waiver of Delay in Effective Date <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B), I find that good cause exists to make this rule effective in less than 30 days. The final regulations are being made effective on January 1, 1995, to authorize locality-based comparability payments in the locality pay areas established by the final regulations on the first day of the first pay period beginning on or after January 1, 1995, as required by 5 U.S.C. 5304(d)(2) and as directed by the President's memorandum of November 30, 1994, to the President's Pay Agent (59 FR 62549, December 5, 1994). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

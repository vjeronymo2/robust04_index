Russia has embarked on a new path", President Yeltsin  said in his opening address at his meeting in the Kremlin today  with representatives of different public and political  movements, the Federation Council, groups and groupings in the  State Duma, and the government.    The meeting, devoted to drafting a memorandum on civil  accord  and peace in the country, was attended by Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin, Russian Orthodox Church Chief Patriarch Aleksey,  Constitutional Court Chairman Nikolay Vitruk, representatives of  parliamentary groups Russia's Choice, Communists of Russia and  the Agrarian Party, as well as of the Miners Independent Trade  Union.    The president called for drafting a document to bring  together all political movements and representatives of the  state power. According to him, "the programme of any party, be  it communist or democratic, contains provisions concerning  problems of importance for the entire country and care for each  Russian citizen". These common provisions should be summarised  and incorporated in the memorandum on civil accord and peace.    President Yeltsin said a working group should be set up to  draft the text of the memorandum. He suggested that the group  be made up of five people with Boris Topronin, co-chairman of  the president's public chamber, as its head.    According to the president, the working group should draft  the memorandum and submit it for discussion in two weeks. He  said he expected every party and public movement to consider the  draft.    The president also proposed that participants in the meeting  discuss a mechanism of adopting the memorandum on civil concord  and peace. "It is necessary to involve the widest possible range  of representatives of parties and public movements in the  signing of this document," President Yeltsin said.</p>

			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Leading Article: Rescue culture ONE OF the consequences of monetary mismanagement in Britain is that the potential equivalent of Germany's Mittelstand - the powerful small to medium-sized business sector - is invariably throttled whenever the economy takes an excessive downward lurch. The process is made worse by insolvency procedures that often give senior creditors little incentive to keep troubled companies in business. While the 1986 Insolvency Act sought to bring more flexibility to the process through company voluntary arrangements and company administration orders, these have been under-used in the recession. A new attempt by the government's Insolvency Service to explain this failure is thus welcome; and its proposed solutions appear well-judged. Insolvency practitioners have long argued that the problem with company voluntary arrangements, which were designed to help the smaller companies that account for the great majority of insolvencies, is that a company has no protection from creditors once it has informed them of the need for negotiations. A breathing space is clearly needed and the Insolvency Service's report proposes a 28-day moratorium, binding on all creditors. This would take effect immediately a notice of a prospective voluntary arrangement had been filed and would be supervised by a nominee who would be a member of a regulated profession. The report goes on to recommend some changes in the rules for company administration orders, designed to remove some of the more forbidding obstacles to this form of attempted resuscitation. More radical ideas come in the form of requests for comment rather than specific proposals. The difficulty of obtaining funding in the course of a corporate rescue is addressed, for example, with the suggestion that super-priority over other creditors might be granted to the financier who advances money in the course of a company voluntary arrangement. The report also hints that the balance between the interests of secured and unsecured creditors may not be right, by asking whether the rights of those who have a floating charge over a business should be removed, allowing them to appoint an administrator only. This goes to the heart of the problem of creating a rescue culture in Britain, because it implicitly addresses the clash of interests between different classes of creditor for whom the survival of the company as a going concern is a matter of varying importance. If the banks are to forfeit some of their existing rights as senior creditors, they will no doubt extract a price. There are also limits to what flexible insolvency laws can do if the directors approach their creditors too late. But a tilt in the balance of power between secured and unsecured creditors may be an essential step towards saving more good businesses from bad financial structures. The Insolvency Service deserves a positive response.</p>

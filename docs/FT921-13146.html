			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Arts: Holloway's 'Spacious Firmament' - Symphony Hall, Birmingham &amp; Radio 3 Simon Rattle and the City of Birmingham Symphony have served Robin Holloway's music faithfully over the last decade. It was they who gave the first performance in 1982 of the Clarissa Symphony, drawn from the opera, long before any opera company had shown interest in taking it on, and followed that with the first performance of a Feeney Trust orchestral commission three years later. On Tuesday they presented the premiere of another Feeney Trust piece, this time involving the CBSO Chorus as well - The Spacious Firmament, originally intended to be heard at the opening of Symphony Hall last year. The idea of filling this wonderful auditorium with grand and thrilling choral sounds seems to have determined the character of Holloway's piece, which seems likes nothing less (and precious little more) than a grandiose celebration of the Great English Choral Tradition, to the extent of evoking many of its most sacred icons. There is an imposing opening of brass and bells set against slabs of choral harmony, which instantly conjures memories of Vaughan Williams's Sea Symphony; later there are brass snarls and choral exclamations borrowed from the demons of Elgar's Gerontius. Moving on again, there are Brittenesque tinges, in the context of which some luscious Straussian string textures strike an alien note. These ghostly presences become so intense that the ear is tempted to invent more connections - might that be a touch of Walton, or that some Holst? - where most likely none was intended. It is distressing to hear Holloway submerging his own musical personality so effectively in such a substantial (half-hour) piece; his personalised brand of 'Englishness' has deepened and become ever more complex in the last decade. His reworkings of the pastoral mode elsewhere have consistently proved tougher and more rewarding than anything to be found here. Holloway traces pit a sequence of seven continuous sections which fall naturally into halves, with each culminating in an extended choral setting: the first, 'Auguries', is based upon Blake; the second is a 'Hymn' drawn from Tennyson. Everything is put together expertly, and scored with unfailing imagination; the Three Choirs Festival is no doubt at this moment pencilling in a performance. But however vividly projected (and it would hard to imagine performers more fiercely committed than Rattle's choir and orchestra) the ground covered in The Spacious Firmament is far too familiar, and its gestures irredeemably second hand.</p>

			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / Institutions beef up their investments Net investment by institutions rose sharply to a record Pounds 14.6bn in the third quarter of the year, according to figures released by the Central Statistical Office yesterday. The figure takes the total for the first nine months to almost Pounds 40bn - well ahead of estimates at the start of the year of Pounds 30bn over 1993 as a whole. It suggests that the total for the year could be about Pounds 50bn, compared with an actual Pounds 31.3bn for last year. Although institutional net new investment in UK company securities fell by Pounds 2.5bn to Pounds 4.1bn, compared with the second quarter, however, investment by individuals through unit trusts rose. Pension funds notably increased their cash and short-term assets by Pounds 1.5bn, and reduced their end-June holdings of UK company securities by Pounds 800m during the quarter. The FT-SE 100 index rose from just under 2900 when the market closed on July 1 to more than 3030 at the end of September. In the third quarter total net investment by unit trusts rose Pounds 700m to a record Pounds 3.2bn, and net investment by long-term insurance funds went up Pounds 2.5bn to Pounds 7.8bn - its highest for almost two years. There was a record increase in cash and short-term balances held by institutions, which rose Pounds 4.1bn, after a fall of Pounds 1.6bn in the second quarter. Investment in UK gilts fell to Pounds 2.1bn after its record Pounds 5.6bn of the previous quarter. One of the main factors in this was the lower net investment by long-term insurance companies, down to Pounds 1.1bn from Pounds 3.6bn in the second quarter. The figures also showed continuing institutional investment in overseas equities, which rose to Pounds 3.0bn in the third quarter. Mr David Shaw, director of bonds and investment strategy at Legal &amp; General, said the extent to which low interest rates would produce a readiness among personal savers to transfer deposits out of banks and building societies into other forms of investment, particularly single-premium products, had been underestimated. 'It looks as if the willingness to move is greater than we all anticipated,' he said. He denied that the institutions had been left behind by the rise in the market, saying that the current strength of the stock market was a sign that the cash shown in the third quarter was being invested.</p>

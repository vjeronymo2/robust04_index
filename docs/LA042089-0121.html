			<p><P> April 20, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Ralph Lee White, a former Stockton councilman who was thrown out of office for  bribing a voter, announced his candidacy for state controller on a platform of  legalizing drugs."We should legalize drugs because it would stop the killing  between gangs," White said at a Stockton news conference announcing his  candidacy for the Democratic nomination, if incumbent Gray Davis runs for  governor as expected. White's colorful and controversial career on the City  Council ended in 1987, when the state Supreme Court upheld a lower court ruling  disqualifying him from the seat he won in a 1984 special election.  </P></p>

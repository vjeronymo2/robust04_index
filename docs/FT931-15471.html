			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / International Company News: Chrysler global offer plan prompts slide in shares SHARES in Chrysler, the financially-stretched US car manufacturer, dipped yesterday morning in reaction to its plan to bolster its balance sheet by raising some Dollars 1.4bn through an international offering of 40m new shares. Chrysler announced the share issue after the New York Stock Exchange closed on Monday night. It wants to take advantage of its buoyant share price, which has more than trebled since the start of 1992, thanks to a line of new products which has won widespread praise on Wall Street and an enthusiastic response from consumers. The new shares will mean a 14 per cent addition to the 295m Chrysler shares outstanding, so the company's stock dropped Dollars 1 1/2 in morning trading yesterday to stand at Dollars 34 7/8 at midday. However, the issue was welcomed by the leading US credit rating agencies, Moody's and Standard and Poor's, which both upgraded the company's debt, citing both the new equity and Chrysler's more competitive product range. However, Chrysler's debt still ranks below the investment grade rating given to the most financially-secure companies. Chrysler's last share issue was in the autumn of 1991, when it raised Dollars 354m through a sale of 35m shares. Chrysler's ability to sell shares contrasts with its position three years ago, when it was in such strained financial health heading into a severe US recession, that analysts questioned if it could survive as an independent company. It has bounced back thanks to its new products, a re-organisation of the way it makes cars, a strenuous attack on costs across the group and the disposal of peripheral interests. However, the company's finances remained stretched. Chrysler said last night the new shares were part of a plan to strengthen its financial condition, increase its liquidity and add to its equity base. Analysts said that without new equity the company had looked unlikely to generate sufficient cash from operations during the current upswing in the business cycle to meet two ambitions. Firstly, to cut its unfunded pension liabilities, which stand at around Dollars 4bn, by around Dollars 2bn, and to build up a Dollars 5bn cash reserve which will enable it to keep funding its product development programme - expected to total Dollars 17.3bn over the next five years - even if the market turns down again.</p>

			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Minister minimises Jubilee Line snag THE GOVERNMENT yesterday played down reports that negotiations to secure financing for the Pounds 1.8bn Jubilee Line Underground extension were on the point of collapse. It said it was 'hopeful' the talks would soon be successfully concluded. Mr Steven Norris, transport minister, said there had been 'no change whatever' in the government's position. Ministers remained committed to putting money into the project once a Pounds 400m private-sector contribution had been approved. 'We are making progress,' he said. 'That progress will continue. When the process is complete . . . we will begin the line.' Negotiations between bank lenders to Canary Wharf and the government on the private-sector contribution to the line have been going on for about a year, following the collapse of Olympia &amp; York, the Canadian company which build the east London property development. Mr Norris admitted yesterday that the complexity of reaching an agreement with O&amp;Y's creditors had been underestimated. He said all parties in the talks had acted in good faith. Any delay to the start of the project was regrettable, but the government's position had remained unchanged. For Labour, Mr Tony Banks, a front-bench transport spokesman, urged ministers to make it clear they were not being pressed by the Treasury to scrap the extension. It seemed the contracts negotiated with the private sector had been changed in terms of government requirements, he said. The Heathrow Express linking the airport to central London could be open to passengers by late 1997 in the absence of 'unforeseen difficulties,' Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, told MPs yesterday. The Department of Transport yesterday started discussions with the private sector about ways of involving private capital in the construction of the Pounds 2.5bn Channel tunnel rail link. It hopes to reach conclusions by early July.</p>

During the meeting, Hu commented on Tibetan spiritual leader  Dalai Lama XIV's recent proposal for a federation between the  Chinese Government and a Tibetan autonomous government. Hu  indicated that "the Dalai Lama has only changed his approach on  the issue. There is no change in his basic stand." Thus, he  disclosed that there is no change in China's stand of rejecting  dialogue with the Dalai Lama.</p>

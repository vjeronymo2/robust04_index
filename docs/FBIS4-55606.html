			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "J.K.K.": "GUS on April Economic </F> Situation--Higher Inflation"]    [Text] The Central Office of Statistics [GUS]  reports that, in April, prices for merchandise and consumer  services were, on average, 2.9 percent higher than in March.  Over the same period, prices for output sold in industry rose  by 1 percent, which was mainly the result of an increase in the  cost of industrial activity (by 1.7 percent) and of increases in  the cost of supplying electricity and water (by 1.1  percent).    Inflation in January, February, and March was 1.8 percent,  1.1 percent, and 2 percent, respectively. In the first 10 days  of May, prices for merchandise and consumer services rose by 1  percent.    In April, compared with March, prices on services rose the  most--that is, by 4.3 percent. In the same period, prices on  food products rose by 2.8 percent, on nonfood products by 2  percent, and on alcohol by 1.7 percent.    According to GUS, the increase in prices on services was  influenced mainly by the April increases in prices for central  heating and hot water and also by increases in prices for Polish  State Railroads monthly passes, prices for one-time tickets on  the State Motor Transport system, and an increase in fees for  stays in convalescent houses, which tripled. On the other hand,  the increase in food prices was influenced by seasonal price  rises with regard to potatoes, vegetables, and fruit (by 9.2  percent) and by an increase in prices for meat and similar  products, which were higher than in the preceding months (by 1.6  percent).    Throughout the first four months of this year, prices rose  by  30.9 percent compared with the same period last year. Over the  time period, prices on services rose the most (32.7 percent),  followed by nonfood products (31.7 percent). Prices on food  rose by 30.1 percent and on alcohol by 22.5 percent.    As GUS reports, the biggest impact on the price changes in  the production sector came from a price increase in those  sectors that have a high value of sold output (products made  from nonmetal raw materials, chemicals, chemical products, and  artificial fibers).    The average monthly salary in the enterprise sector was  5,319,900 zlotys [Z] in April, which represents a drop of 1.8  percent from March, while the average salary computed without  payments from profits and without a balance surplus in  cooperatives, was Z5,088,700, which is an increase of 1.9  percent from March.</p>

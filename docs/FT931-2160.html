			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / Auditing role urged for non-executive directors CORPORATE boards should establish audit committees composed exclusively of non-executive directors, say guidelines published today by Pro Ned, the organisation which promotes the role of non-executive directors and which is backed by the Bank of England. The recommendations are similar to those adopted last year by the Cadbury committee on the financial aspects of corporate governance. The guidelines were adopted in consultation with Pro Ned's sponsors, who include the Stock Exchange, the Institutional Shareholders Committee and the Confederation of British Industry. Pro Ned says board-level audit committees should be responsible for ensuring that a company's financial and accounting systems provide accurate and up-to-date information, that the financial statements give a true and fair picture of its position, and that the external audit is conducted in a thorough manner. External auditors should be able to meet privately with the audit committee at least once a year to enable the auditors to raise unresolved issues of concern, the guidelines say. Also, the full board should circulate a resolution authorising the committee to ensure that senior and middle managers understand and accept the nature and purposes of the committee. The audit committee's functions should include reviewing half-year and annual financial statements before they go to the board, and reviewing statements issued at the time of a rights issue, an acquisition or a bid defence. Guidelines on Audit Committees. Pro Ned, 1 Kingsway, London WC2B 6XF. Pounds 10.</p>

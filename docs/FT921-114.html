			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / World News in Brief Eurotunnel told togive contractors extra payments Eurotunnel, the Anglo-French Channel tunnel operator, was ordered to pay contractors building the project FFr750m (Pounds 77m) per month towards disputed cost overruns, starting from the end of April. The order, which would treble Eurotunnel's present progress payments to contractors, was made by an independent arbitration panel set up to help settle the dispute over contractors' demands for FFr14bn (at today's prices) of extra payments for design changes. Eurotunnel said it would review the decision to see which parts it could accept. Report and Lex, Page 22</p>

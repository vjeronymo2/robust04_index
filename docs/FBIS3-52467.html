			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By a JORDAN TIMES staff reporter] </F>   [Text] Amman--Jordan and the International Monetary Fund  (IMF) have finalised a standby agreement for the year 1994 as  part of the economic restructuring programme the Kingdom is  following since 1989, informed sources said Tuesday [4 January].    They said the main undertaking in the agreement was the  introduction of a sales tax to replace a consumption tax before  the end of next month and a reaffirmation of the Kingdom's moves  to revamp the energy sector to make it cost-efficient.    The sources said no price increase of any commodity or fuel  was envisaged in the letter of intent Jordan submitted to the  IMF on the basis of which the standby agreement was finalised.  The sources could not say whether the agreement was actually  signed by the finance minister.    The accord now goes before the board of governors of the IMF  and, immediately after approval, clears the way for Jordan to  open fresh debt rescheduling talks with the Paris Club of  creditor governments in February.    An IMF certification that a debtor country is following an  economic restructuring programme is essential before  international creditors agree to hold debt rescheduling talks.    The IMF green signal for Jordan will also clear the way for  the Kingdom to seek external financing to service its debts,  estimated to cost around $400 million. The financing is  expected to be raised with help from the World Bank which  convened a donors conference which produced $390 million in  assistance to Jordan for the year 1993.    According to the sources, apart from undertaking to  introduce  the sales tax, the government renewed its commitment to ensuring  that the Jordan Electricity Authority (JEA) would be  self-sufficient by the year 1995.    To achieve this end by improving the performance of the  semi-autonomous JEA and developing the energy sector in general,  the World Bank has extended an $80 million loan supported by a  matching loan from the Japanese Government.    "No other major measures are envisaged in the standby  agreement other than reaffirmation of Jordan's economic targets  as set out in the restructuring programme," said a source  familar with the negotiations that led to the finalisation of  the document.    The source noted that Jordan has already complied with the  IMF requirements of raising fuel prices and reducing subsidies  among other measures envisaged in the economic restructuring  programme.</p>

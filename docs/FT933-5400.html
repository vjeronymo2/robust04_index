			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / Observer: Dangerous game Even non-musical Lloyd's underwriters have more than a passing interest in the progress of the international tour of pop-star Michael Jackson, especially after events in the Far East earlier this week. Promoters of the tour are insured against any losses caused by Jackson cancelling to the tune of Dollars 20m, through a policy brokered in London by CE Heath and placed with a number of Lloyd's syndicates and other international insurers. Heath is a market leader in the esoteric field of 'non-appearance' insurance, a risk for which insurance types regard Elton John as well-nigh uninsurable.</p>

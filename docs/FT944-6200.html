			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Government Statements): Package of measures simplifies complex area of VAT law - Tax treatment of property A package of measures on the VAT treatment of construction, and land and property was announced yesterday, with the intention of deregulating and simplifying a complex area of VAT law, assisting the construction industry and blocking a tax avoidance device. Customs and excise said from March 1, 1995, VAT zero-rating for conversion of non-residential property into dwellings 'will be legislated for and extended to cover most other forms of accommodation. 'The measure means developers will be able to reclaim the VAT incurred in the course of conversion and follows consultation with trade interests. 'The distinction for VAT between new and existing buildings will be clarified. Until now the absence of a satisfactory distinction has been a source of much litigation as developers have tried to get the benefit of the zero rate for new housing. 'There will be legislative cover for two extra statutory concessions which allow builders to reclaim the VAT on ventilation, burglar and fire alarms, and other safety equipment installed in new housing. 'From November 30, 1994, the 'lease and lease back' tax avoidance scheme some developers have used to spread their VAT bills on business property for between 20 and 2,000 years, will be blocked. 'From March 1, 1995, the developers' self-supply charge on business. property will be repealed as a deregulatory measure at the request of the trade. The rules which give landlords the choice of charging VAT (the option to tax) on business rents will be simplified and relaxed. 'From shortly after Royal Assent, the VAT rules governing property owned by more than one person will be simplified as a deregulatory measure at the request of the trade. 'The 'lease and lease back' avoidance scheme has been used by developers to spread VAT liabilities incurred constructing a building intended for use in a business making supplies which are exempt from VAT. Typical users are banks developing their own properties. 'New buildings constructed for business use are standard- rated for VAT. If the building is purchased for an exempt business use the purchaser cannot reclaim the VAT on the purchase price. If the developer is building for their own exempt use, they cannot reclaim the VAT incurred on the cost of construction, ie the VAT 'sticks'. 'In total the net additional revenue to the exchequer is estimated at Pounds 15m in 1994-95 and Pounds 150m 1995-96, when the yield of Pounds 210m from the anti-avoidance measure will be partly offset by the Pounds 60m cost of the deregulation/simplification changes.</p>

			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / Uni Storebrand placed under administration UNI STOREBRAND, Norway's biggest insurer, was ruled technically insolvent yesterday and put under the administration of finance authorities after revealing it had debts of NKr4bn (Pounds 361m). The move highlights the depth of the crisis in the country's financial sector which late last year forced state intervention to shore-up several of its banks through a NKr6bn rescue package. Mr Anders Eckhoff, Uni's chairman, refused to identify the creditors but Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, last June provided a Dollars 30m (Pounds 15m) certificate loan to Uni due for payment today. Mr Jan Erik Langangen, who resigned from Uni last month as president and chief executive, yesterday announced his resignation as chairman of Statoil. Uni's immediate problems arose out of a NKr4.7bn acquisition for 28.3 per cent of shares in Skandia Forsakring, Sweden's biggest insurer. Uni financed the acquisition through loans of NKr3.6bn. The bid failed and the value of the investment has fallen to less than half. Mr Eckhoff said that Uni had a certificate loan of NKr200m due yesterday and that a loan of NKr1bn was due next week. The finance ministry said that in the next three days the holding company had payments on loans of NKr659m due. 'There was not sufficient willingness in influential circles to prevent this situation,' Mr Eckhoff said. Following yesterday's action, the holding company has been put under official administration and a new holding company called Uni Storebrand New AS has been established. The new holding company will acquire the assets of the old holding company in order to maintain the group's activities. Group assets were put at NKr91.83bn at the end of 1991. The non-life, life and international insurance activities will remain intact under separate subsidiaries and continue operations. The state will not transfer funds to the new holding company but there would be possibilities for it to acquire the liquidity it needs from the central bank. A new 'administration' board will comprise three people, including two lawyers. An official with the Oslo bourse said a decision would be made today on whether to relist Uni Storebrand's bonds and shares. However, he did not believe the shares could be relisted.</p>

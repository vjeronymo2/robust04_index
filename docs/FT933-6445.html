			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / Kohl hints he may back France over trade talks IN an extraordinary gesture of Franco-German solidarity, Chancellor Helmut Kohl yesterday hinted strongly that he was prepared to back France in seeking new concessions from the US on farm exports. His words were immediately welcomed by French officials as a vital move to break the deadlock on farm trade in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade negotiations. However, this caused alarm and confusion in several German ministries. A senior official in the chancellor's own office insisted that he was not calling for formal renegotiation of last year's crucial EC-US agreement on dismantling farm trade subsidies. Mr Kohl declared his support for a compromise on the so-called Blair House agreement on farm trade as part of a passionate restatement of his commitment to the Franco-German alliance as the driving force of European integration. Speaking after two hours of talks with Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, the German chancellor said both sides were committed to giving Europe a new impetus and both were committed to the timetable for eventual economic and monetary union. The meeting is the first at the top level since the currency upheavals of July caused the collapse of the exchange rate mechanism, prompting harsh words from Paris blaming Germany in general, and the strict monetary policy of the Bundesbank in particular, for the crisis. There were no harsh words yesterday, with both Mr Kohl and Mr Balladur declaring their closest possible co-operation as beyond doubt or possible disruption. Yet no one had expected Mr Kohl to go further in support of France's determined opposition to the EC-US farm trade deal. 'We have also got problems with the agricultural part of the negotiations, with the Blair House agreement,' Mr Kohl declared. Pressed to explain if he was calling for renegotiation, Mr Kohl said: 'We must find a compromise acceptable for everyone. The Blair House agreement as it stands has some problem areas for us as well . . . It is in the interests of Germany to arrive rapidly at an agreement, and naturally a reasonable agreement.' Any suggestion of a renegotiation of that painful compromise is likely to cause consternation in Brussels and Washington, as well as in the German foreign and economics ministries. The German agriculture ministry confirmed two longstanding problems with the deal: that there was no ceiling on US exports of cereal substitutes to the EC, and that the EC acreage to be taken out of oil seed production was too high. Yet a senior official admitted that no one expected a renegotiation to produce a better deal, in the light of US political opposition. Mr Balladur said he would submit two papers to Mr Kohl on Monday and Tuesday next week: the first on proposals for reform of the Blair House agreement, and the second on a new EC trade instrument to give greater protection to EC manufacturers. Germany and France would seek to agree a common position on both issues, he said. The second French proposal faces furious opposition in the free trade ranks of Bonn, both in the chancellor's office and the economics ministry. Hybrid policy for franc, Page 3</p>

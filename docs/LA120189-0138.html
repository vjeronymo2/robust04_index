			<p><P> December 1, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> EL CAMINO COLLEGE WON'T OK SHOPPING CENTER PLAN  </P> <P> A proposal to turn an El Camino College parking lot into a shopping center has  been set aside indefinitely by college trustees.  </P> <P> Trustees voted 4-0 not to proceed with any of three development proposals  presented to them last month. Proposals had called for building a shopping  center on the 1,100-space lot at Crenshaw and Redondo Beach boulevards and  using profits from the development to build 2,000 spaces in structures  elsewhere.  </P> <P> "It may be premature for the district to make a long-term commitment for the  use of that property other than for education or other district purposes," said  Donald Sorsabal, school vice president. Administrators began studying the idea  in July after a builder said developing the lot would turn a profit.  </P></p>

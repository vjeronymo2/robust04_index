			<p><P> January 3, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> NATO ENDS FLIGHT BAN  </P> <P> NATO forces resumed widely criticized, low-level training flights over West  Germany after a three-week ban prompted by the crash of a U.S. military jet in  the city of Remscheid, a military spokesman said. The crash killed five West  Germans and the pilot. West German air force spokesman Peter Trittermann said  no new measures have been taken to prevent such crashes because "we first have  to wait for the results of the inquiry into the disaster." The report is  expected Jan. 18. Opposition leaders have called for reductions in low-level  flights, but Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Party insists that  the flights are vital to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.  </P></p>

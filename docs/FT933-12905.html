			<p>930722 FT  22 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Paris to wheelout big trade guns for EC FRANCE is planning to present proposals before the end of this month which would give the European Community similar weapons against unfair trade to those of the US, a senior French official said yesterday. The government of Mr Edouard Balladur is expected to finalise next week proposals aimed at making EC anti-dumping procedures 'more rapid and automatic and less prone to political interference', while also broadening the Community's scope to take unilateral action against unfair trade practices. They are likely to dispel any impression that France has 'gone soft' on the Uruguay Round trade talks following its acquiescence in the June agreement between the EC and the US to set a limit on European oilseeds production and in this month's agreement among the G7 countries on tariff cuts to present to other Gatt partners in Geneva. France also plans to make new farm trade proposals in early September in advance of the special joint council of EC foreign and farm ministers that it has requested. The government still hopes enough of its Community partners will realise that last November's Blair House agreement with the US needs renegotiating. On French calculations, the deal would cut the EC share of world cereal exports from 15 to 8 per cent over six years. France also complains that Brussels has yet to make provision for imports of 2m extra tonnes of cereals and some 700,000 tonnes of meat which Washington claims the EC would have to take in as a result of the Blair House deal. The thrust of the French plan to make Europe's 'commercial defences' more like those of the US would: Set a strict timetable for the Commission to follow in receiving anti-dumping complaints, opening inquiries, and imposing provisional duties. The Commission would have less discretion to set aside, or delay, dumping investigations on political grounds as Paris complains it has done in the case of steel imports from eastern Europe. Give the Commission less discretion to end dumping investigations by accepting promises from exporters to raise their prices in the EC market. Remove the reference to Gatt procedures in the EC's 1984 legislation which effectively means the EC can only retaliate unilaterally against non-Gatt member countries. Without this clause the EC would have the equivalent of the US's retaliatory Section 301 at its disposal, Paris believes.</p>

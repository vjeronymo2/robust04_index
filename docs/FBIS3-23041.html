			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report]  <H5>  AL-HADATH Director Receives Threat </H5>   Rabat daily AL-MAGHRIB has reported that the staff of  Tunisian Arabic-language weekly AL-HADATH received a telephone  call on 29 December directed at the manager-chief editor,  demanding that he "stop writing about the (Muslim) brothers;  otherwise he will suffer the same fate as Faraj Foudah."  Additional threats were made on 30 and 31 December. AL-HADATH  reportedly stated that management attached "little importance"  to these threats, attributing them to "traffickers in religion"  and to "plain assassins," and noting, "This strengthens our  belief that we are on the right track--that of fighting for  Tunisia."

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beirut, 27 Jun (MENA)--Egyptian Foreign Minister  'Amr Musa has stated that the comprehensive peace in which Egypt  believes must be based on Israel's withdrawal from all the  territories it occupied in 1967, self-determination for the  Palestinian people, and an agreement on an overall settlement  that could ensure security, withdrawal, and coexistence among  the region's peoples.    In an interview with the Lebanese newspaper AL-DIYAR  published today, Musa said that progress on any of the  Arab-Israeli peace tracks will help the other tracks in the same  way as failure on any track will harm the others. He added that  progress on the Palestinian-Israeli track was followed by  progress on the Jordanian track, noting that negotiations on the  Palestinian track were in parallel with endeavors and talks  along the Syrian track. He noted that U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher has visited the region more than once to  boost the Syrian-Israeli track. He stressed that Egypt believes  the Syrian-Israeli track is the main track that could prove  crucial to the fate of the comprehensive peace or the Middle  East problem.    Musa pointed out that we believe in basic principles,  namely,  that Syria is entitled to regain the Golan according to the 4  June 1967 borders, which would necessitate an Israeli military  and civilian withdrawal up to these borders. He added that  Egypt is closely following the contacts being held in connection  with the Arab-Israeli talks. He emphasized that the  Syrian-Israeli track is of particular importance to Egypt,  because what is in the interest of the Syrian brothers is in  Egypt's interest and because no comprehensive peace can be  achieved without Israel's withdrawal from the Golan. The  foreign minister hoped that progress would be achieved along  this track in the coming stage.    Regarding the Palestinian issue, Musa said that what is  required now is to move from Gaza and Jericho to the remaining  occupied territories and then hold negotiations for a final  solution. He warned against one-upmanship in the Palestinian  arena. He added: Inter-Palestinian collision or one-upmanship  over political movement are not needed; the important thing is  to gear the Palestinian issue toward serving its  goals--self-determination for the Palestinian people.    On the developments in Yemen, the Egyptian foreign minister  warned that if the current fighting continues, expectations are  that things will be "extremely bad." The continuation of this  war, the ongoing killing, and the victims resulting from this  war cannot preserve any unity or serve as a basis for the future  of a state or a people, he added. If the current UN contacts  fail, the international as well as the Arab legality will not  remain silent about the continuation of this war; Yemen's  survival and future are now at stake, he added. Musa ruled out  any Arab or foreign military intervention to end the  deteriorating conditions in Yemen.</p>

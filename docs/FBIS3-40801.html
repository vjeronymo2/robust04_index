Grave problems  are attributed to it, such as mounting terrorism and  unemployment stemming from the scarcity of financial resources.  The growth in population means the shrinking of cultivable land,  in addition to mass emigration from the countryside to urban  areas, and the accompanying negative factors with many-sided  effects.    While the problem is not confined to Egypt alone, being an  Arab and global problem, it is more serious in Egypt because of  the rise in the unemployment rate, the lack of resources, and  the drop in individual income.    The latest statistics released by the Central Statistics  Agency show that the population of Egypt will be 73 million by  the year 2000. The January census of last year counted  58,987,000 Egyptians, which was a 676,000 increase over 1992,  registering a 1.2 percent increase in six months.    The statistics indicate that the rate of increase in recent  years has risen to 1,229,000 persons per year, with a new birth  every 25 seconds. The rate of population increase has thus  reached 2.3 percent. Although this is still high, it is lower  than it was twenty years ago, when it stood at more than three  percent.    Population experts believe that the rate of increase has  significant and serious implications for the future of mankind  in Egypt. This population explosion translates into a further  decline in individual income, thereby having an impact on  standards of living, education, health, and many other vital  issues.    Since taking power, President Mubarak has continued to warn  of the dangers of the population explosion, and has urged  Egyptians to use birth control. He has said that in 10 years  Egypt's population has added the equivalent of the entire Arab  Gulf region. He added that in the year 2000 the population will  have increased by 12.5 percent. Where were the resources for  handling this increase? If the population does increase by that  much, investment flight will occur. The Egyptian workforce is 21  percent of the population, or 12 out of 59 million people.    It is worth noting that Egypt's population in 1801 was 2.4  million, increasing to 9.8 million by 1897. By 1992, it had  reached 59 million, and is expected to jump to 94 million by  2025, making Egypt 17th in the ranking of the 25 most populous  countries in the world.    Dr. Mahir Mahran, minister of state for population and  family  affairs, has rather different estimates, as he believes it is  necessary to differentiate in the statistics between the  population residing in Egypt--56 million--and those residing  abroad, now nearly three million. He indicates that the number  of births, despite the large increase, is considered to be in  constant decline. The number of births last year was down  100,000 from 1988, so that it is expected that by 2000 the  population figure will stand at 66 million.    The statistics touched on the increase in Cairo's population  density rate, which the census showed to be 15 million people,  at 23,688 people per square kilometer. Cairo thus occupies third  place in growth of density, after Calcutta and Manila. It is not  expected that the population of Egypt will stabilize until it  reaches a hypothetical volume estimated at nearly 120 million.  This number is more than double the present population, which is  an indicator of the growth problems, the spread of poverty, and  environmental and social deterioration.  <H5>  Drop in Deaths </H5>   A study prepared by the Egyptian Consultative Council says  that the death rate in Egypt began to decrease at the end of the  1940s. The total death rate was about 30 per thousand residents  after the end of World War II, then dropped to 15 per thousand  in the 1970s and 11 per thousand in the 1980s, and should reach  six per thousand by 2025.    At the same time, the marriage rate has dropped. Reports  indicate a drop in the marriage rate from 11 marriages per  thousand residents in 1960 to about nine per thousand in 1987,  with an increase in the rate of unmarried women who are at least  16 years old to above 20 percent, versus 12 percent in 1960.    Egypt ranks twenty-first among countries of the world in  population growth, according to United Nations estimates, with a  rate of population growth of nearly 2.4 percent between 1985 and  1990; it was 2.8 percent between 1976 and 1986. The average  number of children born to one woman was 4.4 in 1992; it was six  children in 1965. Despite the fact that these numbers are viewed  as remarkably positive when compared with what came before, they  are still high rates that warn of danger.    Perhaps the comparison here is significant. In the United  States, the average number of childen born to one woman is two;  in 1980 it was 1.8.  <H5>  Possible Dangers </H5>   Egypt has had significant experience in birth control, one  which has drawn many and varied criticisms since it began in the  1960s. It has encountered warfare, as well, from various  quarters, and clashed with the customs and traditions of the  majority of Egyptians, who view the process of birth control as  forbidden. The agencies entrusted with birth control campaigns  have endured much in their efforts to change this idea. Despite  all the criticisms and obstacles, it may be said that positive  results have begun to appear, as seen in a drop in the recent  rates of population growth. The question of population growth,  however, remains a grave one for Egypt and its development  plans. The government relies primarily on awareness campaigns in  all available agencies and media: television, radio, and posters  which portray the benefits that may be reaped by families that  use birth control, especially palpable economic benefits in the  family's life, and positive health and beauty results for women  who use birth control.    Many methods for handling the problem have been suggested,  and are still being proposed. The recommendations of a group of  housing experts in Egypt will not be the last. Most notable  among these was a recent study by the Consultative Council. One  of the most important of these recommendations was was emphasis  on improving conditions for women and supporting their  participation in a variety of activities. Society strove for an  increased rate of women's participation, from about 11 percent  in 1987, to about 20 percent by the beginning of the next  century, by preparing the proper environmental conditions so  that women may play their role. Legislation that could limit  women's positive initiatives should be amended; men should be  prepared mentally and psychologically to accept women's role in  society, with an end, in particular, to the exploitation of  children and women; provisions of the labor code that limit the  working age to be no less than 12 should be enforced; and a  strict minimum should be imposed on the current marriage age.    In the health field, the study proposed action to decrease  the death rate among nursing children by 50 percent from its  current level, in line with the official estimates, which were  about 45 per thousand births in 1987, along with the need for  society to construct an ambitious family planning program, in  the context of comprehensive development. This program will aim  at reaching the figure of two children per family within 20  years.    The study dealt in particular detail with population  distribution. It called for the establishment of new developed  societies capable of absorbing about 15 percent of the  population to about 10.5 million people by 2001.    The study emphasized the need to review the "New Urban  Communities" policy, with the aim of investing 100 percent in  them instead of 10 percent, especially in Egypt's present  conditions, and providing the suitable elements of attraction to  draw people to the new societies, while also studying the  failure of established regions to absorb the population  projected for them. It emphasized a link between population  policy and economic and social policy as a means of promoting  population policy in the development plan, and the need for the  government to allocate budget funds for the population planning  program.    There are many dangers facing Egypt should growth rates  continue to rise this steeply. They are a growing strain on its  resources, and, hence, a negative factor in the qualities and  capabilities of its people. It also diminishes the standard of  nutrition and health, education, and housing services in the  necessities of life. Perhaps the problem in Egypt is even more  threatening, for although there are nearly 37 projects to halt  the population explosion, it is still a problem without a  solution! There may have been a sign of hope, though, when Egypt  was chosen as the site for the next World Population Conference  this year.</p>

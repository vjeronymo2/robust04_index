			<p><P> September 4, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REED AGREES; HERRMANN, 12 OTHERS, CUT;  </P> <P> RAMS: ROSTER LIMIT OF 47 IS REACHED. THE CLUB WILL CONTINUE ITS SEARCH FOR A  CORNERBACK, ROBINSON SAYS.  </P> <P> Holdout defensive end Doug Reed is back in uniform, and free agent Derrick  Faison survived the cut. But 13 players -- including quarterback Mark Herrmann  and veteran linebacker Mel Owens, who will be placed on injured reserve today  and probably will be sidelined for the season -- were waived as the Rams  trimmed their roster to the 47-man limit Monday.  </P> <P> Today figures to bring another flurry of roster moves as the Rams search for a  cornerback and try to decide which of their walking wounded will go on injured  reserve.  </P> <P> Reed, a six-year veteran, ended his 41-day holdout when he agreed to a one-year  contract Monday. He said he is happy with the deal and happier still to be away  from his favorite taco stand.  </P> <P> "I was off and on with the conditioning stuff," Reed said. "When I got  frustrated, I'd go down to the local taco shop and eat about 15 tacos. When I'm  mad, I eat tacos. And I was mad about 30 of the 40 days.  </P> <P> "But really, I think I'm in decent shape. I'm in as good shape as some of these  guys who've been here but haven't been able to practice, so we're all in the  same boat."  </P> <P> Reed, who requested to be traded at one point during his holdout, said he  thinks he could put any bitterness he feels toward the organization behind him.  </P> <P> "I felt we should have started earlier and not waited until the last minute,  but they needed me pretty bad and I'm here to close up the holes," he said.  </P> <P> The Rams said they planned to keep three quarterbacks, including Herrmann, Jim  Everett's primary backup the last two seasons. But the rash of recent injuries  apparently led to the decision to waive Herrmann.  </P> <P> Coach John Robinson said he will "still consider" retaining Herrmann in  addition to Everett and Chuck Long in the probable event Herrmann passes  through waivers, in which case the Rams could re-sign him as early as today.  But Herrmann, who had an impressive exhibition season, was clearly  disappointed.  </P> <P> "It's very frustrating," he said. "I thought I had a real good camp and  progressed well. It's disappointing, but it's just the way of this business."  </P> <P> Rookie wide receivers Faison and Tony Lomack, friends who thought they were  battling for the No. 4 receiver spot, both came out winners Monday when the  Rams decided to keep five receivers. Hamstring injuries to Henry Ellard,  Flipper Anderson and Aaron Cox played a prominent role in that decision.  </P> <P> "I can't describe my feelings," Faison said. "I didn't sleep at all last night.  Now, I just have to work harder and harder to try and stay on the team."  </P> <P> The Rams have only two healthy cornerbacks -- veteran Bobby Humphery and rookie  Latin Berry -- and the potential for disaster is obvious. Robinson was asked if  he is considering moving safety Anthony Newman, who didn't practice Monday  because of a sprained toe, to cornerback.  </P> <P> "We're considering moving Newman out there and we're considering looking for  somebody on the (waiver) wire or even a trade," Robinson said. "We have to  consider everything."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ram Notes  </P> <P> In addition to Mel Owens and Mark Herrmann, the Rams waived linebacker Stephen  Bates, defensive tackle General Brown, wide receiver Paco Craig, center Elbert  Crawford, fullback Mel Farr, wide receiver Monty Gilbreath, offensive tackle  John Guerrero, defensive tackle Jerry Leggett, safety Lupe Sanchez, wide  receiver Tim Stallworth and running back Fred Whittingham.  </P> <P> Cornerback Jerry Gray, who underwent arthroscopic knee surgery Saturday, was  walking briskly around Rams Park Monday. "There's no pain at all," Gray said.  "I just can't run on it." . . . Unless the Rams pick up a cornerback who can  return punts, Henry Ellard will be the Rams' punt-returner Sunday against Green  Bay, a job he won by default because of injuries to Tony Lomack (hamstring) and  Darryl Henley (hip).  </P></p>

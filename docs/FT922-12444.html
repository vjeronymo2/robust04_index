			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Markets (London): A curious lack of enthusiasm When the Birmingham and Midland Bank started business in the summer of 1836, it began the longest unbroken history as a shareholders' company of any of the English clearing banks. That history is now, it seems, drawing to a close. Midland Bank, as it is known these days, has agreed to be taken over by a bank thirty years its junior, the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. Tuesday's Pounds 3.1bn bid for Midland by HSBC Holdings, the Hongkong Bank's parent company, may not succeed: shareholders may decide not to follow their board's advice to sell out, and there is also the possibility of a counter-bid by Lloyds. Still, the odds currently favour the Hongkong bid. There has been something a bit odd, however, about the events surrounding this week's announcement of the terms of the bid. Mr Brian Pearse, the ex-Barclays man who has been Midland's chief executive for a year, said all that was proper as he endorsed the Hongkong offer. It was clearly the right thing to do, he said, adding that he was personally excited by the challenge of making the takeover work. Seldom has anyone so excited sounded quite so mournful, however. A similar ambivalence showed up in the stock market's reaction. Only three months ago, Midland Bank was trading at 208p. HSBC's offer, valued at 378p a share on Tuesday, represented an 82 per cent premium over that price, and a 6p premium over Monday's closing price. Since then, Midland's shares have drifted down; HSBC's shares have risen. The Kuwait Investment Office spent much of Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday attempting to find a buyer for the bulk of its 10 1/2 per cent stake in Midland - initially asking 362p, then settling for 356p. By Thursday's close, the Hongkong bid was worth 396p, and the Midland price was 362p. The lack of enthusiasm shown all round - by the KIO in selling its stake; by the market in pushing Midland's share price away from the offer rather than towards it; by Lloyds in not snapping up the KIO stake - is curious. The two alternative futures for Midland, after all, are genuinely exciting ones. If the Hongkong bid prevails, Midland will form part of a big new London-based banking group, a significant addition to the FT-SE; if Lloyds were to bid, win, and pass the regulators' scrutiny, the acquisition and dismemberment of Midland would transform the UK banking sector. Either way, there is a lot at issue for investors. You would be hard put to tell by watching the stock market, however. Perhaps portfolio managers have been too busy watching the FT-SE to pay attention to its constituents. On Thursday morning, the index touched 2673.4, only six points away from its all-time closing high of 2679.6, set in September 1991. It dropped back in the course of Thursday, however, to close at 2638.6, a 66-point gain since the previous Friday and a 202-point rise since the Conservative election victory. Political enthusiasm does not explain all this rise. Investors have obviously been allowing themselves to believe that the economic recovery, signalled by a few indicators earlier in the year, is at last under way. February figures for industrial production, published on Tuesday, showed a rise of 1.1 per cent, well above economists' expectations. The seasonally adjusted index of manufacturing output is now back at levels last seen in the autumn. On Friday, the statisticians reported that the number of people out of work at any time had risen by one million since the recession started. But the figures also provided some glimmer of hope: seasonally adjusted unemployment in March rose by 7,400, the smallest monthly increase since unemployment started rising in May 1990. In the three months to February, the average increase in unemployment was over 42,000. The enthusiasm for shopping and house-hunting displayed over the four-day Easter weekend will provide a guide to whether those economists expecting essentially flat output this year are right; or whether the correct answer lies with those who expect at least 1 1/2 per cent gdp growth as the pent-up demand of consumers spills into the High Street. The shopper with the Visa card was not urged on, despite some market expectations to the contrary, by a cut in official interest rates. Short term interest rates firmed very slightly in the course of the week, with the rate implied by the short sterling futures contract rising from 10.03 per cent at Friday's close to 10.20 by the end of Thursday. The pound clambered creakily off the floor of the ERM, potentially increasing the latitude for a lower base rate. But mildly discouraging news on inflation in both Germany and the UK probably counted against an immediate interest rate cut. Results reported this week included some dreadful figures and write-offs from big construction groups. Tarmac's pre-tax profits for 1991 fell nearly 90 per cent to Pounds 21m, and the company cut the final dividend to 2 1/2 p from 8 1/4 p. Mowlem's full-year profits fell from Pounds 34m to Pounds 3m before tax. It cut the final dividend from 15.35p to 4.85p, though the company's chairman, Sir Philip Beck, sounded encouraging about the outlook. Taylor Woodrow, under a new chairman, reported a loss before tax of Pounds 2.7m, against a profit of Pounds 83.4m a year ago. The company is pulling out of US contracting, and has cut 600 jobs. Higgs and Hill reported the worst figures, a 1991 loss of Pounds 16.7m, against profits of Pounds 6.8m the year before. But its chief executive, Mr John Theakston, offered the best summary of the past year: 'It's not been a lot of fun out there,' he said.</p>

			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: UK property Deals by Citibank and Land Securities, and now institutional interest in a Kuwait Investment Organisation portfolio, have shattered the silence of an inactive property market. They have also given some impetus to a recovery in what has been the worst performing sector in the stock market this year. Nevertheless, investors should not brace themselves for a rerun of 1993, when the property sector climbed 80 per cent. Recent sales have reflected an acceptance of lower prices, rather than an improving market. And there is still no sign of the supposed Pounds 10bn that property agents claimed was waiting to pour into UK property earlier this year. However, there are positive signs. Rental growth of 4 per cent should be achievable next year, and this will feed through into property prices. The situation should also be helped by a return, albeit subdued, of the property developer. This removes further supply from the market in the short term. In the face of gradually rising property values, the sector's 20 per cent discount to asset value should therefore start to dissipate. This does not translate into a bull market: portfolio management will be the key to increasing asset values in a low-inflation environment. Performance within the sector will therefore be disparate, but at least the trend should start to turn positive.</p>

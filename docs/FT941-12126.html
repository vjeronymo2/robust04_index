			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Leading Article: Don't cry over Rover Many Britons will see the sale of Rover to Germany's BMW as a defeat. It marks the end of an independent and indigenous car industry. The deal may also seem like another step in the inexorable decline of British manufacturing. But, while such sentiments are understandable, there is no reason to feel defeated. The damage done, largely by poor industrial relations, to Britain's car industry occurred years ago ' both before and while Rover and British Leyland were state-owned. Yesterday's deal is a sign that much of that damage has been repaired. Since Rover was sold to British Aerospace, it has improved productivity, reversed its long-term erosion of market share and taken its product range up-market. BMW's willingness to pay Pounds 800m in what its executives see as the boldest strategic move in the car group's history is testimony to the strides that have been made since privatisation. Retreating into a narrow nationalism is not an attractive option for British industry. The country's openness to foreign investment is one of its principal attractions, which has produced not only a valuable flow of finance but enabled British industry to acquire new skills. In the motor industry, there have been large investments by Japanese groups such as Nissan and Toyota, and German groups such as Bosch. Rover itself has already learned Japanese lean production methods through its association with Honda. Britain's openness to foreign investment has also brought rewards in other sectors. For example, the sale of ICL, the country's premier computer group, to Japan's Fujitsu has led to a revitalised corporate strategy and helped ICL to emerge as the most profitable large computer company in Europe. Practical question Some will be tempted to argue that Rover should have kept its independence either within the BAe group or as a stand-alone business. Such a strategy might have secured its survival but it would not have provided a platform from which to grow and flourish. The high costs of research, development and distribution mean that Rover's future was best secured as part of a partnership with another car manufacturer. Since no such British partner was available, the practical question was whether to link with BMW or Honda. Honda had attractions. Rover might have learned more from the Japanese company given its superior productivity record by comparison with BMW. Set against this is the fact that Honda's own models are in direct competition with Rover's. In the end, the decisive factor was that BAe wanted to sell out completely to concentrate on its core aerospace and defence businesses. Honda was not prepared to buy the whole company. Initial ideas BMW's plans for Rover are not yet fully formed, but the initial ideas are encouraging. The German group wants to broaden Rover's production range, perhaps updating the Mini - something Rover could not have done on its own. There is also talk about giving the British group access to BMW's distribution channels and engineering expertise, while gaining economies of scale from joint component purchasing. In the long run, BMW sees Rover as central to its strategy of providing a full range of models. Questions, of course, remain. The most important is whether BMW can, indeed, turn itself from a successful maker of luxury cars based in Germany into an international group manufacturing less expensive cars as well. Can the company's core competences be successfully applied to a higher-volume part of the car market? On the answer to this question Rover's future will largely hang. There are also doubts over what will happen to Rover's existing relationship with Honda. At some point, it will probably have to be unwound. But Rover is currently so dependent on Honda that a hasty divorce could be damaging. The world's motor industry remains highly competitive. The imperative to innovate, enhance productivity and fight for markets will not go away. There is no guarantee of success. But in BMW, Rover has found a first-class partner that gives it a good chance of doing so.</p>

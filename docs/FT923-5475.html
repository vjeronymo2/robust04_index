			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / Hungary expects recession to worsen HUNGARY'S recession is proving far deeper and more prolonged than expected, according to a new batch of gloomy official forecasts. The National Bank of Hungary, the central bank, is now braced for a fall of 5 per cent in gross domestic product this year, a drastic revision of its original forecast of zero growth. Unemployment, currently just below 11 per cent, is set to rise to 17-20 per cent next year, a government report to parliament warns. Expectation that output will continue to fall, after declines of 4 and 10.2 per cent in 1990 and 1991, is increasing pressure to stimulate the economy while at the same time depriving the government of the budgetary means to do so. The government blames falling output on the wave of company failures triggered by this year's new bankruptcy act. Another unforeseen dampener on demand has been the rapid growth in personal savings, which rose to a ratio of 14.3 per cent of income last year. The growth in savings and the banks' reluctance to lend has boosted liquidity and prompted a precipitate fall in interest rates. A three-month treasury bill auction last week yielded an average 16.55 per cent, down from 35 per cent a year ago. This has led to hopes that lower interest rates will stimulate investment-led growth. The first tentative signs of that came last week with the announcement of a 3.9 per cent rise in industrial production in June from May. The severity of the recession however is crippling the government's efforts to contain the budget deficit within limits demanded by the International Monetary Fund. Shortfalls in tax revenues and extra spending on unemployment threaten to push this year's budget deficit to Ft220bn (Pounds 1.4bn), up to 8 per cent of GDP.</p>

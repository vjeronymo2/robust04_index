			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Babangida may try to rerun poll NIGERIA'S military President Ibrahim Babangida pledged yesterday to install a democratically elected president on August 27, the date originally scheduled for the handover to civilian rule. It was not immediately clear how General Babangida planned to implement his promise and he provided no further details. A presidential spokesman suggested he would authorise a rerun of last month's presidential elections, which he annulled earlier this week. The US said yesterday it did not trust assurances he would soon turn the country over to elected officials. Mr Mike McCurry of the State Department said: 'Given the events most recently, there will have to be much more proof in the pudding before we rely on those statements.' The US has cancelled about Dollars 1m (Pounds 667,000) in non-humanitarian aid to Nigeria and is reassessing all aspects of relations with Africa's most populous country. Gen Babangida, who seized power in a 1985 palace coup, made his pledge yesterdayafter briefing senior military and police officers on the outcome of a meeting of his top military-civilian council. Later his spokesman said the decrees authorising the transition to civilian rule 'had been suspended and not repealed', leaving open the possibility he may be having second thoughts. 'We shall install a democratically elected government on the 27th of August for this country,' Gen Babangida saidin Abuja, the federal capital. But his remarks, ahead of an address to the nation, gave no clear indication he was prepared to reverse his decision to annul the June 14 presidential poll which pitted Moshood Abiola against Bashir Tofa, or to order the election to be held again. Mr Abiola emerged the comfortable winner. 'We are committed to democracy,' Gen Babangida said. 'We are committed to our democratisation process. . . We shall install a democratically elected president that will meet the aspirations and the yearnings of our vision of Nigeria of the 21st century.' Dressed in full military uniform, he said he would address the nation today. 'I am going to tell you how we intend to do it.'</p>

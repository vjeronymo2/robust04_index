			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHINESE MASSACRE  </P> <P> Our first reaction to China's cynical denial of the killings in Tian An Men  Square is outrage. But we remind ourselves that the Big Lie is in the universal  tradition of statecraft -- some lies are just bigger than others and some liars  more brazen.  </P> <P> Still, how can the Chinese leadership possibly think it can get away with it,  given the witnesses and evidence on film? By comparison, even the decision to  fire on the demonstrators -- the tragic and brutal reaction of autocrats  fearing a threat to the state -- seems "logical."  </P> <P> The dreaded answer appears to be that the Big Lie is being orchestrated  precisely because the Chinese leadership is turning the clock back and  reimposing political repression and isolation. Yet Deng Xiaoping reaffirms  China's goal of economic modernization. How can Deng expect that political and  economic freedoms will be kept distinct and apart? How does he imagine the Big  Lie will survive his Long March generation? How can he not realize, on the  evidence of Mao and Stalin, that his Big Lie will be a deadly legacy to his  successors that will surely further undermine communism's legitimacy?  </P> <P> Sadly, this myopia is just the latest manifestation of an old condition: After  over a hundred generations, old men in China still cannot adjust to change or  learn when or how to let go of power.  </P> <P> HONG DEA  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

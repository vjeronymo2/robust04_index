The drug distribution dynamics in mice of both praziquantel  (PZQ) and praziquantel liposome (PZQ-Lip) were determined using  RP-HPLC method. The results indicated that the drug  concentration of blood, liver and spleen in the PZQ-Lip group  was higher than those in the PZQ group from 1/2 to 16 hours post  ip. the t 1/2 of the former was considerably prolonged. The  toxicity of PZQ-Lip tested by LD[.sub]50[/] was decreased  about one fourth as compared with PZQ (3372 vs. 2454 mg/kg).  There was a significant difference in the cyst inhibition rate  between PZQ-Lip group (68.7 percent) and PZQ group (14.3  percent) (P &lt; 0.01) as shown by the results of secondary  alveococcosis mice treated with either drug at 500 mg/kg-d x 12  d for four consecutive courses. Histological observation of the  germinal layer after treatment showed that the damage of PZQ-Lip  group was more severe than that of PZQ group. The  ultrastructural observation showed that both drugs had marked  effects on the organelles of cells. The above experiments  indicated that the efficacy of PZQ-Lip was more effective than  PZQ for treatment of alveococcosis.    Key words: Alveococcosis, liposome, praziquantel,  pharmacokinetics, chemotherapy, histology, ultrastructure</p>

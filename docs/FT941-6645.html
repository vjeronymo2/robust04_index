			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Business and the Law: Battle over drugs patent set for House of Lords - Legal briefs The battle between two pharmaceuticals companies over whether metabolites produced by the body in response to drugs can be patented is set to go to the House of Lords. This follows the UK Appeal Court's rejection of the claim by Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, of the US, of an infringement of its patent in the metabolite of terfenadine, an anti-histamine. Merrell's original patent in terfenadine had expired, but the company claimed that, by selling tablets containing the drug, Norton Healthcare of the UK was providing the means for infringement of its subsequent patent in the terfenadine metabolite, produced when terfenadine is taken. The Court said that, if Merrell's argument was accepted, then 'if they discovered that inside some organ of the human body aspirin invariably produces a hitherto unsuspected compound, they could patent the compound and thereby preclude anybody selling aspirin'. The Court said Merrell's patent covering the terfenadine metabolite should be revoked or amended so it did not apply to the metabolite when produced by the human body. The case is being watched by producers of generic drugs, which fear big companies will use similar measures to prevent the sale of generic products.</p>

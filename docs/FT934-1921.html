			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / Daily Mail issues non-voting shares The Daily Mail and General Trust yesterday announced a bonus share issue of non-voting shares in an attempt to increase liquidity in the stock. The move responds to City concerns that the share price of around Pounds 116 was too 'lumpy', leading to thin trading and difficulty with screen formats. The issue will be on the basis of nine non-voting shares for each voting and non-voting share. This will not alter the ownership of the DGMT with Lord Rothermere, chairman, and family interests continuing to hold 50 per cent of the total equity and 75 per cent of the voting shares. It is highly unlikely that Lord Rothermere would ever change the voting rules because he wants to ensure that family interests retain control. Mr Peter Williams, finance director, acknowledged that the issue of such a large number of non-voting shares was against recent trends towards enfranchisement. He pointed out that shareholders had had a good run - since 1982 the value of the shares had increased by 1350 per cent. DMGT, publishers of the Daily Mail and the Mail on Sunday, also announced annual pre-tax profits of Pounds 66.7m, up 74 per cent on the previous year's restated figure, on turnover of Pounds 683.9m. Trading profit in the year to October 3, before reorganisation and redundancy costs, increased by Pounds 9.7m to Pounds 89.1m. At Associated Newspapers, all three titles generated record advertising revenue with the Daily Mail achieving a 15 per cent increase. Northcliffe Newspapers, the regional publishing group, produced a modest increase in trading profit. Euromoney Publications has already announced a 28 per cent in pre-tax profits. But Whittle Communications, of the US, incurred a loss. A final dividend of 112p makes a total of 148p, against 130p. Adjusted earnings per share, before exceptional items, rose from 400.6p to 501.6p. Lex, Page 20</p>

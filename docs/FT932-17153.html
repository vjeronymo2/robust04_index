			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Khmer Rouge kill 26 in Cambodia SUSPECTED Khmer Rouge guerrillas killed 26 people and wounded 20 in a rifle and rocket attack on a village video hall in central Cambodia, aUnited Nations official said yesterday, Reuter reports from Phnom Penh. One attacker was also killed. It was the third massacre within three weeks believed to have been carried out by the group responsible for the murder of over 1m Cambodians. All the villagers were ethnic Khmers and unarmed civilians. At least 10 attackers fired four rockets and automatic weapons in Snau village, in the Kompong Svay district of Kompong Thom province. The country had appeared to be heading towards peace after the signing of an agreement in Paris in October 1991, formally ending 13 years of civil war among four rival factions. But thousands of ethnic Vietnamese are fleeing their homes along the Tonle Sap (Great Lake) to escape violence, some aiming to leave Cambodia altogether. At least 103 ethnic Vietnamese have been murdered since the Paris pact was signed.</p>

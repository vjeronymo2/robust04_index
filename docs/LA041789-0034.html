			<p><P> April 17, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> BANGLES ARE QUEENS OF HOMECOMING CONCERT  </P> <P> No surprises, but a triumphant homecoming nonetheless. Performing before a  capacity crowd at the Santa Monica Civic on Saturday, the Bangles socked out a  sparkling 90-minute set that stretched from the top of today's charts back to  those halcyon daze when the girls graced the stage of the Whisky, lo, these  seven, eight years ago.  </P> <P> They still grace the stage. No corny costume changes. No kootch dancing. No  sticking guitars between their legs. No labored call 'n' response routines. No  desperate solicitations for affection. No pandering.  </P> <P> No. They sang, they played. And when you can sing as well as Susanna Hoffs,  Michael Steele, Vicki Peterson and Debbi Peterson, you don't have to stoop to  conquer.  </P> <P> Quick: How many other groups have four capable lead singers? And what other  rock groups -- male or female -- have ever sung four-part harmonies with the  style and precision of this fabulous feminine foursome?  </P> <P> Let's see, there's the Beatles, the Beach Boys, the Hollies, the Byrds, Buffalo  Springfield (and their legion of imitators/spinoffs) and. . . ?  </P> <P> Yeah, and how many of those acts who are still functioning are worth the price  of a ticket today?  </P> <P> Of course, some of the band's self-confidence comes from racking up a  half-dozen hits over the past five years, especially when the most recent (the  power ballad "Eternal Flame") is the biggest yet.  </P> <P> Opening with a driving version of Paul Simon's "Hazy Shade of Winter" and  closing with the pharoahest-of-'em-all silliness of "Walk Like an Egyptian" the  Bangles' show was superbly paced, sprinkling major ("Manic Monday," "If She  Knew What She Wants") and minor ("Hero Takes a Fall," "Walking Down Your  Street") hits atop a crop of tunes taken from their current "Everything" LP  like so much sugar-plum fairy dust.  </P> <P> Energetic and democratic, the evening was not without a couple of  semi-spontaneous moments. Tossing a tease chorus of "I Fought the Law" onto the  intro of "If She Knew . . ." for one. And it's not only nice to hear the local  girls still honor '60s L.A. popfolkrocker Emmitt Rhodes by pulling the old  Merry-Go-Round number "Live" out from under their nuevo-retro punkadelic funk  'n' finery, but also comforting to hear that Hoffs, introducing a song about  being rejected, can confess that this had happened to her once.  </P> <P> Judging by Saturday's crowd, the Bangles appeal to everyone from dedicated  followers of '60s fashion (lotsa vests, paisley, miniskirts, dangling earrings  and long hair) to couldn't-care-less surfer dudes 'n' dates, ranging in age  from kindergarten though second mortgage.  </P> <P> And if seeing the Bangles makes little girls go home and beg their parents for  electric guitars, who but the neighbors can complain?  </P></p>

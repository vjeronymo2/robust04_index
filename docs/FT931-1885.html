			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Keating puts his stamp on cabinet MR Paul Keating, Australia's Labor prime minister, is expected to promote several backbenchers and junior ministers in a wide-ranging government reshuffle to be announced today. Up to 12 ministers are likely to be replaced and several others moved as Mr Keating stamps his authority on the government following Labor's unexpected victory in last week's federal election. The prime minister is also expected to announce changes to the structure of the government by merging departments and replacing or moving senior public servants. Senior bureaucratic changes are expected to include the appointment of Mr Ted Evans, Australia's representative on the International Monetary Fund, to replace Mr Tony Cole, head of the Treasury. The most prominent ministerial casualty is likely to be Mr John Kerin, trade minister, who was demoted by Mr Bob Hawke, the former prime minister, after a lacklustre spell as treasurer (finance minister) in 1991. Several other ministers face the sack, but Mr Keating's freedom of action has been increased by the retirement from parliament of a number of senior ministers including Senator John Button, the industry minister. Mr Neal Blewett, social security minister, and two other senior ministers who contested the election have since volunteered to return to the back benches. The only minister certain to retain his present appointment is Mr John Dawkins, the treasurer, who was appointed by Mr Keating shortly after he replaced Mr Hawke in 1991. However, Mr Keating has resisted pressure to give Mr Dawkins the additional post of deputy prime minister, currently held by Mr Brian Howe, the relatively low-profile health minister. Senator Graham Richardson, a former minister who resigned last year after allegations about his relationship with a businessman facing fraud charges, is expected to return to the government. The scale of the likely changes reflects Mr Keating's desire to reshape the ministerial team he inherited from Mr Hawke, which included several lacklustre ministers appointed in the early 1980s. The government's unexpected election victory has given Mr Keating greater than usual power over Labor's three ideological factions, which select the ministry, leaving the prime minister to allocate portfolios. Meanwhile, the defeated Liberal and National parties - partners in the conservative opposition coalition - will hold separate leadership ballots today. Mr Tim Fischer is likely to be returned as National leader, but Mr John Hewson, the Liberal leader, faces a strong challenge from Mr John Howard, the party's employment spokesman. Mr Howard led the coalition to defeat in the 1987 election, but is widely believed to have lost largely because of a maverick intervention by Mr Jo Bjelke-Petersen, the then conservative premier of Queensland. Mr Howard's free market views are similar to those held by Mr Hewson, but he has promised a wide-ranging review of existing policies if he wins the leadership vote. Both candidates claim to have sufficient support to win.</p>

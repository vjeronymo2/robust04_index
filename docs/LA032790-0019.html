			<p><P> March 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> Statutory Records: As Oscar ages, it becomes harder to set new records.  </P> <P> William Wyler's "Ben-Hur" is still the most Oscared film of all time with its  11 awards out of 12 nominations. Katharine Hepburn remains the most Oscared of  all performers with her four statuettes, and the late John Ford will still be  the most Oscared director with his four awards. So far, Oscar Hammerstein holds  the record for the only Oscar to win an Oscar. BETH KLEID  </P></p>

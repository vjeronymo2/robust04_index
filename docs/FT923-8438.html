			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / Meat and potatoes row: The future of London's produce markets A bout of haggling has broken out in London's fresh food markets. The recession, competition from supermarkets, and new European Community hygiene regulations have led one market to contemplate a raid on another's pitch. The protagonist is New Covent Garden Market, the government-owned fruit, vegetable and flower market housed in functional sheds on 56 windswept acres in Battersea. After losing more than a dozen tenants last year, it has set its sights on filling its empty space with tenants from Smithfield meat market. Smithfield, the reluctant target of the advance, is the last working market in the City, occupying an elegant, ironwork building designed by Sir Horace Jones in 1868, on a bustling site by St Bartholomew's Hospital. The Corporation of London, Smithfield's owner, expects to spend Pounds 50m to bring this Victorian market, which still uses wooden barrows and sawdust-covered floors, up to EC hygiene standards. The cost has prompted an argument with tenants, who face increases in rent from about Pounds 11 per sq ft to about Pounds 28 per sq ft. The corporation says if the dispute is not resolved in six months, the traders will have to move out. The debate over Smithfield's future involves a broader question about the future of London's large fresh-produce markets, namely New Covent Garden, Smithfield, Western International, a fruit and vegetable market near Heathrow, Billingsgate, the fish market in Docklands, and Spitalfields, the fruit and vegetable market at Hackney Marsh. Are there too many? And would combining two or more markets enhance trade by attracting buyers such as restaurateurs who want to buy meat and vegetables at the same place? 'The logic of rationalising fresh food distribution in London is apparent,' says Mr Bill Bowman, chairman of Covent Garden Market Association. 'Some degree of consolidation must arise, particularly if trends in the retail trade continue. There is less business to be done by all concerned.' Mr Bowman believes that consolidating the London markets in a centralised operation, such as Rungis in Paris, was an opportunity missed 30 years ago when the government started moving Covent Garden out of the heart of London. Consolidation could also help the markets to bear the costs of meeting EC hygiene regulations. These costs are not confined to the meat trade. The corporation fears that Billingsgate could need an extra Pounds 20m to be brought up to standard. The regulations differ from market to market but they all entail spending on refrigeration and cleanliness. Supermarkets already comply with them to a greater extent than the markets, so they should incur less added cost, and could thus gain a greater share of the fresh food market - currently rising by 1 per cent to 1.5 per cent a year. Supermarkets account for just over half the fresh produce sold in the UK. Even if Smithfield and New Covent Garden agreed that joining forces would cut their costs, a merger would not be simple. Legislation would be needed to allow New Covent Garden to sell meat and to allow Smithfield to move. An even more complicated legal battle is likely if New Covent Garden tries to set up a rival meat market to attract Smithfield's tenants. Nobody has a right to establish a meat market within six and two-third miles of Smithfield, according to a corporation charter. The corporation believes the charter is watertight; New Covent Garden thinks otherwise. The matter is now in the hands of the Ministry of Agriculture, which is considering 'very carefully' New Covent Garden's proposal to sell meat. Its deliberations are coloured by the government's desire to privatise the market at the best possible price. A report by Binder Hamlyn, the accountancy firm, two years ago said that New Covent Garden was worth between Pounds 20m and Pounds 266m, depending on whether it was sold to its tenants or to a property developer. Since its value as a development site has largely disappeared since then, the government may have an interest in bolstering its trading profits. Weighing against the proposals, however, is the prospect of a bitter confrontation with the Corporation of London over selling meat. The corporation has a battery of reasons why Smithfield should not move. For one thing, it owns Spitalfields, which might be threatened if a 'one-stop' meat and vegetable market were set up at New Covent Garden. For another, the corporation thinks that legislation to allow Smithfield to move could take several years. If a bill was delayed or failed, the corporation would not have time to implement EC hygiene regulations by the December 1995 deadline. But New Covent Garden's Mr Bowman thinks the corporation's strategy is fundamentally flawed. Its scheme to refurbish Smithfield is 'an expensive and, arguably, unsatisfactory compromise solution, which is likely to create as many operational problems as it would solve'. New Covent Garden argues that combining with Smithfield 'would create a market complex of formidable strength and attraction to customers'. The cost of moving Smithfield would be just Pounds 11m. In response, the corporation says the attractions of 'one-stop' shopping are overestimated, since relatively few retailers need both markets. It also points out that half of Smithfield's Pounds 50m refurbishment cost would be incurred anyway, since repairs to the listed structure are needed. Nonetheless, most Smithfield traders have told New Covent Garden that they would consider moving if a formal offer were made. The attraction of New Covent Garden to the tenants lies in its efficiency and ease of access. But it is not clear whether a move would resolve the tenants' concern about rents, since they would face similar increases. The tenants say that they cannot afford such a sharp rise. 'We can't entertain it,' says Mr Gerry Vincent, who runs the Market Tenants' Association. The patience of Smithfield's tenants will be put to the test over the next few months because the agriculture ministry is unlikely to rule before then. If it decides that New Covent Garden cannot sell meat, the only route out of the impasse is for the corporation and the tenants to reach a rent agreement. Only then could Smithfield continue to trade on the site it has occupied since the middle ages.</p>

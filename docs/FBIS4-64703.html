			<p>BFN     [Text] Habur, Diyarbakir -- Deputy Prime Minister Murat  Karayalcin, who made a whirlwind visit to Diyarbakir Monday [2  May], startled the people of the region with two promises.    The deputy prime minister promised that a new democracy  package, formulated jointly by his Social Democrat People's  Party (SHP) and its coalition partner True Path Party (DYP),  would be disclosed in the first half of May. Then he promised  the region's people, who are in the midst of an economic  recession, that trade through the Habur border gate, a main  point for Turco-Iraqi border trade, would be reactivated soon.  "The reactivation of trade through the border gate is important  for the revitalization of trade in the region," Karayalcin, who  traveled in a private plane to Diyarbakir's Habur gate, told an  accompanying group of journalists. "The purpose of this visit  is to observe the situation existing at the Habur gate, which  occupies an important position in regional trade," said the  deputy prime minister. Trade through Habur gate, the main point  for border trade between Turkey and Iraq, was restricted two  years ago due to "security concerns." The move brought an angry  response from the traders in the region: The Diyarbakir Chamber  of Commerce threatened last month to violate the embargo if it  was not compensated for its losses.    Karayalcin was also informed of a number of local  complaints.  Habur customs official Ali Akinci and a group of Kiziltepe  Chamber of Drivers administrators, who briefed Karayalcin on  their difficulties, asked the deputy prime minister to  reactivate economic activity in the region and rescue them from  unemployment.    The deputy prime minister responded by promising the speedy  reactivation of the border gate.    "Due to reasons of security and taxation and some other  concerns which I do not want to elaborate on now, the gate has  been inactive since 1992. We are aware of the difficulties. At  this point, Turkey is approaching a new era in its fight against  terrorism. The terrorist group is on the verge of collapse.  Now the Habur gate can be reactivated, with a new  understanding." He said his findings in the region would be  assessed by the government and a final decision would be made.    "Let me also tell you, I have another piece of good news:  The  coalition partners will disclose the democratization package to  the people in the first half of May," he added, to shouts of  "Prime Minister Karayalcin" from his audience.    It had been announced earlier that the package would be  finalized by May 5, but now it is claimed that it will be  disclosed by next week at the earliest. Karayalcin's earlier  statements to the press on the reopening of the Habur gate,  however, indicated that the issue was still being assessed.    The visit took place after Turkey's calls for the flushing  out and storing of the oil in the Iraqi-Turkish pipeline  appeared to have been given the cold shoulder. "We are  continuing our talks with American officials. We want to give  the Western world and the United States the message that the  impact of the suspension of trade with Iraq has become  unbearable," Karayalcin said. "Reactivating the Habur border  gate will not conflict with U.N. resolutions and Turkey's  international obligations," he insisted.    He stressed that another aim of his visit was to make a new  assessment at this particular stage in the matter of Turkey's  security.    "A new assessment between all related bodies, including the  General Staff, will be made. My visit aims to speed up such an  assessment," he said.    Turkish ambassadors in key countries will also travel to the  region later this week.</p>

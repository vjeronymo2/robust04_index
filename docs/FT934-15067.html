			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / FT Exporter (2): International trade looks east - As strong growth in GDP in East Asia continues, James Blitz examines the implications for the leading industrialised countries of a possible tilt in the balance of economic power / World economic trends ONE OF the biggest challenges to anyone involved in international trade today is the development of East Asia as an economic force. The world economy continues to be dominated by the leading industrial powers  -including the US, Germany and Japan - which produce 79 per cent of world merchandise exports and 87 per cent of exports of manufactures. But predictions about the future growth of the economies of of East Asia - including China, Taiwan and Hong Kong - have led some economists to think the world is on the verge of a big shift in the balance of economic power - one which will be classed alongside the successive rises of the UK, US and Japan in the two centuries since the industrial revolution. The growth of what the World Bank has dubbed the 'Chinese Economic Area' (CEA) could also have a big impact on trade flows around the world. At the same time, economic growth in the region - which is based on cheap labour, flexible workforces, and rapidly rising skill levels - is a challenge to western levels of competitiveness and could pose a threat to employment levels in Europe and the US. 'The major industrial countries face significant adjustment,' said Paul Armington and Uri Dadush, World Bank economists, in a recent article on the region. 'The world economy will have to adjust to the emerging strength of the CEA in the same way that it had to adjust to the emergence of Japan two or three decades earlier.' What are the prospects for the growth of this region ? At the market exchange rate, the gross domestic product of the CEA was Dollars 600bn in 1991, or about half that of France. But, according to Messrs Armington and Dadush, the CEA will, by 2002, rank fourth in the world in terms of GDP, well ahead of France, Italy and the UK, and more than four times the size of India. They do not exclude the possibility that, by 2010, the region will rival the US in terms of GDP. The CEA also contributes to the development of the Asian economies as a whole and to a process by which an increasing share of their total trade is with other countries in the Asian region - not because of any trade block, but because rising income levels mean more end-products are being consumed in the region. The Chinese region is raising the growth potential of its trade partners. Malaysia, for example, exports 6.3 per cent of its GDP to China alone. In turn, the world export market share of the Asia-Pacific rim countries - the CEA plus Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand - grew from 19 per cent in 1970 to 30 per cent in 1992. Economists at American Express Bank wrote recently that this improvement in Asia's trade performance and the growth of intra-regional trade would help its member countries to withstand demand slowdowns in Japan, the US and the EC. Analysts are now asking themselves what impact this region will have on world trade as a whole. The first issue that concerns exporters is whether this region will attract more flows from powerful neighbours such as Japan, reducing Japanese investment in the US and the EC. As yet, those fears seem unfounded. There is certainly a strong flow of Japanese investment into Asia, and Japan already exports some 1.3 per cent of its GDP to the CEA region. But Japanese investment flows to the US and to Europe have been equally strong. According to Japanese officials, less than 15 per cent of their country's investment has gone to Asia in recent years Instead, the most highly publicised attempts to cement ties with this region in recent months have come more from the US. Government officials in Washington say more than 40 per cent of US trade is now with the Asian region. Attempts are being made to cement US-Asian ties through Apec, the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation group. The group's November meeting in Seattle will be important to the development of those ties. EC officials have argued that Apec may be little more than a stick with which the US is trying to beat Europe, as trade pressures between the two blocs continue. The future of the Apec initiative may depend, in part, on whether tensions develop between the US and the EC in their attempts to conclude the Uruguay round of trade negotiations later this year. The second issue of concern to exporters is whether the region could turn into a protectionist trading bloc, putting tariffs on imports and exports to the EC and North America. Economists argue that the conditions for this do not exist. Asian markets are geographically far apart. They have disparate levels of income - ranging from a per capita income of Dollars 600 per head in Indonesia to Dollars 16,000 a head in Hong Kong - and different levels of resource development - Malaysia has plenty of natural resources while Korea has almost none. More threatening would be the development of protectionist attitudes by the US or EC towards Asia because of the huge differential in labour costs. According to Morgan Stanley, the investment bank, German labour costs this year will average Dollars 24.87 an hour, US labour costs will average Dollars 16.40 an hour, and Chinese labour costs only 44 cents per hour. The demand for comparatively unskilled labour is therefore certain to be adversely affected by the growth of the Asian developing economies. But European countries would, in turn, lose heavily by imposing tariff barriers on Asian imports. A protectionist policy would mean the loss of western exports of high technology to these markets as they develop. At the same time, some economists argue that there is plenty of scope for the growth of a highly skilled labour force which could put the final touches to semi-finished products made in Asia. The hope must be that the politicians understand that the CEA could become a leading market for high technology and capital goods exports from the industrial world. The danger is that the industrialised nations will take the easy, protectionist road in an attempt to protect the short-term interests of its unskilled labour force.</p>

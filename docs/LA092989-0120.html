			<p><P> September 29, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PUTTING BITE ON NUISANCE PETS  </P> <P> The Rolling Hills City Council is prepared to add more teeth to its animal  control code by increasing penalties for the owners of noisy and destructive  animals, particularly dogs.  </P> <P> Although dogs are permitted to roam without a leash in the largely rural  community, tolerance for nuisance animals is decreasing. As a result, the  council Monday introduced a measure, scheduled for adoption by the council Oct.  9, under which the owners of nuisance animals could be prosecuted for  misdemeanor violations.  </P> <P> Under the measure, a second complaint against a dog that consistently barks or  repeatedly destroys private property results in a hearing before the city  manager. The manager then determines remedial action, which could include  prosecution. The manager's decision may be appealed to the council.  </P> <P> The amendment was introduced after several residents complained that barking  dogs were disturbing them.  </P></p>

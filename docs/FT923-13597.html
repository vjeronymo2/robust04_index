			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / Management: Promoting service with a smile Service and efficiency were seldom buzzwords of hoteliers in the Soviet Union and eastern bloc under communism. But as the former Soviet republics and east European economies open up, many hotels are trying to raise standards to attract more tourists and business travellers. According to Andrew Lockwood, lecturer in hotel and restaurant management at the University of Surrey: 'In the past, many of the hotels had no need to budget or look at cost control - the money was simply provided by the state. Now they need to learn how to budget and prepare financial statements,' he says. The hotels also face practical problems in attracting and training suitable staff, and obtaining regular supplies of food and fuel. When Toomas Sildmae started recruiting staff for the Palace Hotel, rated the best in the Estonian capital of Tallinn, he vowed not to employ anyone who had worked under the old Soviet system. As managing director of Finest Hotel Group, he wanted staff who were young, motivated and service-minded to establish a hotel which could cater both for businessmen and well-heeled tourists. With unofficial unemployment estimated at 20-25 per cent in Estonia, there is no shortage of labour, although there is a shortage of well-trained hotel staff. Initially, the Palace Hotel sent its staff to Finland for training only to discover that the best people quickly found jobs there. So the hotel has started a number of schemes to keep its employees. Staff receive part of their salary in roubles, plus a sum ranging from one-to-three times the rouble portion in hard currency, according to how well they perform. In a country where the rouble is regarded with some contempt, the hard currency is very attractive. Staff are entitled to discounts at the hotel's hard currency shop which sells alcohol and imported food. They can also order basic groceries on the premises so they do not have to waste time shopping during their working hours. This also means staff spend their working hours at work. Staff are given cheque books with which to pay for groceries, canteen or restaurant food, and the money is deducted from wages. The most senior staff are entitled to use company cars, bought second-hand in Germany which can be resold two years later for almost the same price. 'A hard currency salary and the prestige of working for a successful business is important,' says one Estonian official. 'It's very easy to fire people here so if you have a good job, you don't want to lose it - it's quite an incentive for people to smile in the hotel.' Even so, Sildmae, a former trade ministry official, sees the government's privatisation plans as the most serious threat to attracting staff. 'Estonians like to work for themselves, even if that means having a two-metre wide kiosk on a street corner . . . we have to persuade them that it is not bad to work for someone else.' Food and fuel supplies have posed problems for the hotel, and the group's separate restaurants, and pizza chain in Tallinn. The company employs four people in its purchasing department simply to ensure that it has the right ingredients. Most of the food is produced in Estonia and is bought from the private sector, but some items - alcohol, French cheeses, spices and fruit - are imported, mainly from Germany. While it is possible to buy food in bulk, it can be very difficult to guarantee supply. 'You can only get the fishermen to supply salmon for the three months when it is available, so the purchasing staff must buy, prepare and freeze it so it is always on the menu,' says Sildmae. Last winter, Estonia had to cut heating in offices and homes, and rationed fuel supplies as Russia started to charge world market prices for energy supplies. Sildmae rented a filling station and bought as much petrol as possible for the rental cars and delivery vans. The decision paid off and the group now has surplus petrol. The group was less fortunate with its heating supplies last winter. The hotel was unable to control its heating supply and had to install electric heaters to prevent the rooms from turning into iceboxes. Now, it plans a separate system for heating the water and rooms so that it can run off an independent energy supply next winter.</p>

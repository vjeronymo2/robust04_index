			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / What we should have done: Western governments must learn from their failures in Yugoslavia to prevent similar tragedies elsewhere Everyone must be hoping 1993 will be less of an annus horribilis than 1992. But in terms of war and destruction in eastern Europe it could well be worse, unless western governments drastically improve their performance. To help them, I have drawn up a list of actions by which they might have averted successive tragedies in Yugoslavia, had they taken them at the right time. Early 1991. The EC could have informed all parties that (a) it would give no further assistance to Yugoslavia until the six republics had all agreed on a new democratic constitution (presumably a confederal one); and (b) it would not recognise or assist any republic that unilaterally seceded. (But most west European leaders were not thinking about Yugoslavia then. They were preoccupied with the Gulf war.) June-July 1991. When the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) began military operations against Slovenia, the EC could have responded by according immediate diplomatic recognition to that republic, while warning the Croatian government it could only expect the same support if it reached a power-sharing agreement with the Serb minority. Autumn 1991. The EC and the international community as a whole should have responded much more firmly to JNA and Serb attacks on Croatia, notably by imposing an oil embargo and using naval power to stop the bombardment of Dubrovnik and other coastal towns. January 1992. The Twelve should have withheld recognition of Croatia until the conditions set the previous month on constitutional freedoms and minority rights were fully satisfied. They should not have called for a referendum in Bosnia-Hercegovina, but should have made it clear they would recognise that republic as independent only when it had a constitution agreed between the elected leaders of all three communities. Similarly, they should not have quibbled about the name of Macedonia, but made recognition of it conditional on a power-sharing agreement between its Slav and Albanian communities. Spring-summer 1992. Having recognised Bosnia-Hercegovina as an independent state and admitted it to the UN, other states should have come to its assistance. They were not obliged to intervene directly in the Bosnian civil war, but the UN Security Council could have ordered Serbia, Montenegro and Croatia to stay out of it. Those three republics could have been told to take effective steps, under UN supervision, to prevent armed men, weapons or strategic supplies from going into Bosnia; and if they refused could have been subjected to serious economic sanctions, enforced strictly from the start, on land, sea and river. More should have been done, and sooner, to help Mr Milan Panic and other pro-peace politicians get their message across to the Serbian electorate. Alternatively, if western powers were unable or unwilling to protect Bosnia from external interference, at very least they should have allowed the government they had recognised, and the Moslem community from which it drew its main support, to obtain weapons to defend themselves against aggressors who were already heavily armed and extremely ruthless. Summer-autumn 1992. Having recognised Bosnia-Hercegovina but failed to defend it, and helped thereby to bring about the civil war and determine its course, western powers must be considered morally responsible for the appalling fate that befell the Moslem population. They were, therefore - and in my judgment are still - under a moral obligation to intervene directly to save that population, securing it in a 'safe haven' as they had done the Kurds of northern Iraq the previous year. That would not have solved the political problem, but would at least have given the victims a space in which to survive while a political solution was sought. Instead, the west has contented itself with half measures. Grudgingly and belatedly it has sent in troops, under UN command, to try to ensure that supplies reach what is left of the beleaguered civilian population. But it has failed to face up to the logic of this intervention. If troops are needed to get supplies through, it is because unescorted supplies are subject to obstruction. Sending troops therefore implies a will to confront the obstructors; yet that will seems to be lacking. It is futile to talk of 'enforcing' the no-fly zone and simultaneously of 'avoiding confrontation'. Enforcement implies confrontation: you cannot have one without the other. In their desperation to avoid this unpleasant fact, western leaders resort to absurd alternatives such as the proposal to cut off telecommunications with Serbia - which would only help Mr Slobodan Milosevic to keep the Serbian people isolated in his private world of paranoid fantasy. The anxiety of British and other ministers about endangering the lives of their troops, or 'getting sucked into a quagmire', is understandable. But was it necessary to advertise this anxiety at every stage, thereby relieving the Serb leaders of fears about the consequences of their actions? This has given to them, and to other nationalist leaders throughout the region, the idea that their best hope of reaching a satisfactory 'solution' to their problems is to impose a swift fait accompli, relying on the west's reluctance to intervene, and make it irreversible as fast as they can. If Mr Milosevic and his allies have so far refrained from attempting an 'ethnic cleansing' of Albanians from Kosovo, it is surely because they are already militarily overstretched and because, even for them, getting rid of 90 per cent of the population appears a daunting task, rather than because they fear an effective western reaction. And it is not only they who are drawing conclusions. Mr Vladimir Meciar, the Slovak leader, has already adopted the fait accompli strategy by building the Gabcikovo dam on the Danube, in defiance of neighbouring Hungary. He will no doubt do the same in quelling any opposition from the Hungarian minority within Slovakia. But who is to say that Hungarian nationalists, on their side, will not take a leaf out of his book? Some of them can already be heard arguing that, since Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia have now both dissolved, the frontiers Hungary had to concede to them in 1919 are no longer sacrosanct and the Hungarian minorities in Slovakia and Vojvodina (northern Serbia) should no longer be left outside their motherland. Similar arguments are being used by Russian nationalists eager to help their compatriots left behind in other ex-Soviet republics, and by the leaders of some of those republics to justify discrimination against Russians, whom they see as the potential fifth column of a new Russian expansionism. Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen have done well to produce a peace plan for Bosnia-Hercegovina that looks workable, and even better to focus the world's attention, at last, on the central issue: the insistence of the Serb leaders on wielding exclusive sovereignty in the areas they control. But it is important to understand that their plan only looks workable because it takes account of 'new realities', and thereby in a sense ratifies the methods by which those realities were brought about. For nothing can reverse the destruction of towns and villages accompanied by mass murder and other atrocities. Even if the actual buildings are rebuilt, the atmosphere of unthinking trust in which different ethnic communities once lived intermingled is impossible to restore.</p>

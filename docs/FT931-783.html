			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Arts: A nude man within reach - Screen EVERY MARCH, a group of famous women compete for the chance to hold a nude man in their hands while the world's TV audiences look on. The women are called film stars; the nude man is called Oscar; and leading the field for this year's Best Actress contest, on Monday, are the America's Susan Sarandon and Britain's Emma Thompson. Let me declare a conflict of interest. Although the Briton in me wants Thompson to win the statuette for giving the cinema of EM Forster a full eight-pint blood transfusion, the internationalist in me says something else: that Susan Sarandon, nominated for Lorenzo's Oil, has spent 20 years giving even more blood to even more critical stretcher-cases and is overdue for accolade. Sarandon's down-home passion as an actress - the low elastic voice, the pretty-plain features, the hooded eyes that range from half-mast slyness to full Bette Davis pop-open effect - has raised a dozen films from the dead: King Of The Gypsies, The Other Side Of Midnight, The Hunger, Uncompromising Positions . . . As a reward, Hollywood occasionally throws her a major movie. Atlantic City, Pretty Baby, Bull Durham or Thelma And Louise which earned Sarandon her last year's Best Actress Oscar nomination. If she wins this year's, for a film in which she power-acts everyone off the screen including co-star Nick Nolte, Sarandon will no doubt get up on the stage and play the appropriate role: the speechifying, gushing, jewel-bedecked Movie Star. 'I would like to thank . . .' But when I met her, filming on location in New York, I discovered something rarer than the Roc bird. A film actress who tells you what she actually thinks about the film industry. About the roles it provides for women (and men); about stage versus screen acting; about how films are born in the age of high-concept marketing; and about the difficulty - impossibility? - of being both an actress and a movie star. Sarandon On Casting And Typecasting. In my career I've been 'discovered' about four times. 'She's good at playing waitresses,' they say after Thelma And Louise, so I get offered a row of waitresses] 'She's good at prostitutes' after Pretty Baby, so every script I'm sent is set in a brothel. I don't know what they consider a Susan Sarandon role to be. (Wry laughter). Sarandon On Anti-Agents And Asking-Fees. When it comes to my choosing roles, my agents are kind of anti-agents. They never advise me along the company line. For films like Bull Durham or Light Sleeper I'll take half my asking price. Because you know that as soon as you get an offer for Dollars 2 1/2 m with a script that it's going to be horrible. If you don't do the parts you want to do, you're a prisoner of your own celebrity. We still get paid obscene amounts of money (laugh and emotive grimace) to do a pretty ridiculous job. So you keep your living standard lower to get a higher range of interesting work. Sarandon On Roles For Women. Thelma And Louise was a breakthrough, but I don't think it resulted in any consciousness-raising about female roles in Hollywood. I don't believe there are that many good parts for men either. It's just that even with bad parts in uninteresting films the focus is on the man's problems. The women are there in a shallow or caricatured role as the emotional support. I still don't see that changing. Sarandon On Film-Making In And Outside Hollywood. Most big-studio projects today are put together from the poster working backwards. The advertising concept takes over the movie and the director, scriptwriter, actors all have to fit in. If you film in LA itself, it can feel very regimented, like a 9 to 5 job. The studios have their rules, the unions too. That's why I love working on location. Everybody scrambles and helps each other out, the job definitions are less so strict. Hollywood has become a factory town with all that follows from that, and I think that's why you don't hear people talking about pictures there, it's always 'product.' Sarandon On Acting For Screen And Stage. The difference between theatre and film, I've always thought, is like that between making love and masturbation. In theatre you know you're reaching someone - the audience; and what they give back is taken and changed by you into something that fits the context of the play. Film acting is very much a self-centred, detached form of concentration. You have to make individual moments work and hope whoever puts it together has the same idea you do as to how it fits. But it's like doing a jigsaw in the dark. In the last scene in Bull Durham, when Kevin (Costner) comes back to me and we're sitting on the swing and it's kind of emotional, for that scene we had to keep stopping all day for the sun, and then go off to shoot bits of a totally different scene in the rain, then come back to the swing again .. So the director suggested something that I think was inspired. We played music, so we could find our way back each time to the same song that had a kind of emotional fertility for both of us. It can be maddening to keep stopping and starting all the time. You can never know if the scene is working as a flow. But I guess that's what's addictive about movie acting. You're never sure if you're getting it right, so you keep going back to try again.</p>

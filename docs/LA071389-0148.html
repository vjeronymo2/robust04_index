			<p><P> July 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Chiat/Day Completes Acquisition: Los Angeles-based Chiat/Day advertising agency  completed its acquisition of the Mojo MDA Group of Australia for about $66  million. Chiat/Day/Mojo, which will have billings in excess of $1 billion, said  about 20 people in Mojo's San Francisco office have lost their jobs as a result  of the merger. Many of the layoffs were triggered after Mojo lost its  $10-million ad business for the Toyota Dealers of Northern California because  of a conflict with Chiat's giant Nissan account.  </P></p>

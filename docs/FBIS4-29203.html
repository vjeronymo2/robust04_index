			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 15 KYODO -- Former Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa has paid back a 100 million yen loan borrowed  in 1982 from scandal-tainted Sagawa Kyubin trucking firm,  Hosokawa's former financial secretary said Wednesday [15 June].    Masatoshi Miyama testified under oath at the House of  Representatives Budget Committee about the former premier's  alleged shady financial deals, which partly led Hosokawa to  announce April 8 his intention to resign.    Miyama strongly denied allegations that Hosokawa may not  have  paid back the 100 million yen loan and that it was received as a  secret political donation, adding he can "swear by heaven and  earth."    The former secretary carried 20 million yen in cash to  Sagawa  Kyubin in fiscal 1983 and handed over 10 million yen annually  from fiscal 1984 until the loan was paid back in full, he said.    Miyama, however, said Hosokawa did not pay back the interest  on the 100 million yen loan.    Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin Co., which was later merged into Sagawa  Kyubin Co., proposed to Miyama in February or March 1983 that  the trucking group would pay the interest as a political  donation for Hosokawa, and he accepted the proposal, Miyama said.    In his resignation announcement, Hosokawa said he discovered  that loan interest was received by his office as a political  contribution for him under an accord with Sagawa Kyubin.    About Hosokawa's alleged purchase of 300 shares in  telecommunications giant Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp.  (NTT), Miyama supported Hosokawa's previous explanations that  the 1986 transaction was carried out by the former premier's  late father-in-law, not by Hosokawa himself.    Miyama, however, said he did not tell Hosokawa's former  financial consultant Shozo Fujiki that the stock transaction  would be made by Hosokawa's father-in-law.    Shortly before Hosokawa's announcement to step down, Fujiki  told a news conference that he had thought it was Hosokawa's  transaction when he helped the deal.    "Now I feel it was insincere," said Miyama, suggesting he  acted as Hosokawa's secretary when he arranged the transaction.    Fujiki also said during the news conference that Miyama  asked  a financial company if Hosokawa can borrow money for the NTT  share purchase under a different person's name. Hosokawa was  Kumamoto governor at that time.    Miyama denied the allegation, saying, "such a thing is not  in  my memory at all."    Miyama also said Hosokawa has not declared to tax  authorities  some 57 million yen in profit made through investments via  former magazine publisher Yusei Kuwahata.    Miyama said most of the profits were used for Hosokawa's  political activities.    Hosokawa said in his April 8 announcement he used his  personal funds for dealings via an "old friend" from 1981 and  obtained profits in a way he said could have violated the law.    After the Diet testimony by his former aide, Hosokawa  emphatically said he now has a good reason to reject any call by  the opposition that he testify himself, and his remarks were  echoed by top officials of the ruling coalition.    The testimony clearly demonstrates that the corruption  charges against Hosokawa are groundless, said Masuo Matsuoka of  Japan New Party, which is headed by Hosokawa.    "That settled the whole issue," said Kozo Watanabe of  Shinseito, another coalition party.    The two main opposition parties, the Social Democratic Party  (SDP) and the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), however, have no  intention of stopping hounding the former prime minister.    They are poised to make a renewed demand for Hosokawa to  testify, hoping to set the stage for submission of a motion of  no confidence in the cabinet of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata.    But the ruling coalition will dismiss such a call, coalition  executives said.    "There is nothing left that requires further clarification  from Hosokawa," one Shinseito kingpin said.    The testimony by Miyama has relieved the shaky coalition of  concerns about possible political repercussions from the issue,  insiders said.    The lingering broadside against Hosokawa's past financial  impropriety "will have no impact on the political situation,"  said Shinseito's Watanabe.    Some coalition officials also took a swipe at the SDP's move  to join forces with the LDP in demanding Hosokawa's testimony.    "That kind of action will make our alliance talks with the  SDP impossible," one coalition executive said.</p>

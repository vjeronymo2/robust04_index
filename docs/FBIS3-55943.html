			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Stepan Valentinnikov report under the "Around Lefortovo" </F> rubric: "Bonus With a Protest"]    [Text] An extremely curious document and a short  commentary on it have been published in the first issue of the  newspaper MEGAPOLIS-KONTINENT....    Directive No. 2105-r of the Russian Federation Council of  Ministers-Government dated Moscow, 23 November 1993.    1. The Russian Federation General Prosecutor's Office shall  be permitted to provide workers of investigative and operational  brigades investigating crimes committed 3-4 October 1993 with  material assistance equivalent to three months' salary.    2. The Russian Ministry of Finance shall to this end  allocate 116.7 million rubles from the Russian Federation  republic's budget.    [Signed] O. Soskovets, first deputy chairman of the Russian  Federation Council of Ministers-Government.    We would like to believe that the government directive we  have reproduced here is a joke. But the source, which passed  the document to the editorial office, is entirely trustworthy.    Of course, these two short paragraphs of an unclassified and  seemingly ordinary government decision raise a number of  questions. For example, why should the government permit the  General Prosecutor's Office -- an independent state organ -- to  do something when the actions of government officials are  subject to scrutiny by this very same prosecutor's office? And  why should workers at the prosecutor's office investigating  October's bloodshed suddenly be allocated up to three (!) times  their normal salary? Have they become destitute? Or are they  no longer working for money? Or is it perhaps just compensation  for the moral damage that this sort of investigation inflicts on  the souls of the sensitive prosecutors? However, let them have  it, these 116.7 million rubles from a budget that is already  showing a deficit. The simple fact is that, judging from this  document, yet another myth has been exploded -- the myth of the  independence of the General Prosecutor's Office. How sad it is  to part with our illusions about the rule-of-law state....</p>

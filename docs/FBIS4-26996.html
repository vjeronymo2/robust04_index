			<p>BFN     [Text] Exactly 110 years ago Ng Choy became the first  Chinese member of the Legislative Council [Legco]. He had in  fact been sitting in the chamber for the previous four years but  was not officially appointed until 1884. It had taken almost  half a century of British rule before one of the local people  was considered suitable to have some say in government.    Today the members of the Legislative Council face an even  more crucial choice on the extent of representative government  considered suitable for Hong Kong.    Despite the rhetoric, they are faced with no more than a  modest choice. Even the most radical proposal, Emily Lau's call  for a fully elected legislature, falls far below the level of  representative government which prevails in newly independent  Eritrea, a country which has only recently emerged from a bloody  civil war, leaving only the most basic infrastructure in place.    In Hong Kong, where modernity and the latest of everything  is  taken for granted, a fully elected legislature would not have  executive powers and could not form a government. However this  is of no more than academic interest because Lau's proposal,  which has a great deal of public support, does not have the  slightest chance of being accepted by the members of the  legislature.    Instead there is a far more basic choice between a set of  government proposals which, under the most generous  interpretation, would give most of the voting population a  chance to elect half the members and a set of proposals from the  Liberal Party, which essentially confines universal suffrage to  no more than a third of the seats up for election.    The most remarkable aspect of the debate over this issue is  that there has been practically no discussion of the merits of  the proposals but a great deal of talk about whether or not  China will like the outcome of the debate.    Some of those joining the debate appear to have ignored  China's often repeated position on the matter. The Chinese  Government has clearly stated that it will not recognise the  decision reached at today's Legco meeting because it does not  recognise the authority of the legislature and believes that  constitutional reform can only be decided in bilateral  negotiations between Britain and China.    Despite this, some members of Legco, notably the Liberal  Party, believe that the constitutional reforms can be shaped to  meet China's requirements. This is a bit like trying to achieve  semi pregnancy. If China is intent on simply dissolving the  three tiers of government covered by the electoral arrangements,  it will presumably do as it says. It will not half-or  quarter-dissolve them in the same way that a pregnant woman will  not half-or quarter-deliver a baby.    It may be, however, that China softens its position or  decides to scrap the existing bodies and replace them with  something very similar. The problem is that we are assured, by  the very people trying to mould their proposals into Chinese  shapes, that China will not change its policy and it is  confrontational to expect the Chinese Government to do so.    Thus we are left with a decision to be taken on its merits.  The real question that legislators should be asking is whether  a higher or lower degree of representative government meets the  aspirations of Hong Kong's people.    This may be considered as an oversimplistic approach. We  would argue that the issue is essentially simple and should not  be obscured by unnecessary sophistry.    However we cannot ignore the reaction of the new sovereign  power. China has a perfect right to take a profound interest in  Hong Kong's constitutional reform. The Basic Law, or  mini-constitution for the post-1997 period, contains outline  provision for the election of the three tiers of government.  Sensibly the Basic Law drafters did not attempt to create an  inflexible and highly detailed blueprint for the electoral  system. It says that "the method for forming the Legislative  Council shall be specified in the light of the actual situation  in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region".    This is a very flexible statement open to interpretation. At  the moment China and her supporters are choosing to make the  most conservative interpretation of the Basic Law. A more  liberal interpretation may follow. But the Basic Law is clear  on one point, a point contained in the Joint Declaration. At  the outset the Basic Law states that the National People's  Congress authorises the new government of Hong Kong "to exercise  a high degree of autonomy and enjoy executive, legislative, and  independent judicial power".    If there is a sliver of sincerity in this statement it must  mean that Hong Kong will be given the right to determine many  aspects of the way it is governed.    Legislators thus have a clear choice today. They can vote  for what they believe to be right and just or they can vote  along lines they believe will be acceptable to a power outside  Hong Kong. The irony of the situation is that the fate of the  electoral proposals resides in the votes of a handful of  legislators who have been elected by nobody but hold office  thanks to a system of colonial appointment which is about to be  scrapped.</p>

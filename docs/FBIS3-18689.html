			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by "Stue": "How Can Illegal Arms Exports Be </F> Prevented?"]    [Text] Bonn, 4 Mar -- In the Federal Government's view,  telephone surveillance by the Customs Criminal Investigation  Office has proved an efficient tool in preventing illegal  exports of defense products. The parliamentary state secretary  in the Economics Ministry, Kolb, said in a Bundestag debate on  Friday [4 March] that a major German supplier "of a foreign  country's nuclear program" was detected with the help of  telephone surveillance. Since October 1992, the Customs Criminal  Investigation Office has applied for telephone surveillance in  11 cases. Five cases led to criminal procedures.    In an amendment to the Foreign Trade Law, which went through  its first reading in the Bundestag on Friday, the authorization  -- limited to 31 December 1994 -- to partially circumvent the  secrecy of letters and telephone conversations to allow  persecuting severe offenses against the arms trade and export  laws, is to be extended by two years. This was criticized by  Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] deputy Bachmeier. He  said that the new regulation would entail permanent telephone  surveillance being granted to the Customs Criminal Investigation  Office, which must, however, not be given intelligence service  authorities. Activities involving the secrecy of postal and  telephone services should only be carried out by the federal  prosecutors. In the government's view, the regulation will have  to be tried out over a longer period of time.    Other amendments to the Foreign Trade Law are mainly aiming  at harmonizing German regulations with European Union [EU] rules  on the control of dual-use products. They will enable the  Federal Exports Office to continue granting export licenses  under future EU regulations. The powers of the authorities  controlling the observance of the regulations will also be  extended to comply with European directives. The SPD considers  this measure a "misleading signal" that does not serve the aim  of introducing the high German control standards in Europe.  Kolb said that in the fields of controlling conventional arms,  services, and know-how transfer, the EU partners would not  implement the strict German regulations. New EU directives  would require German regulations to be changed.    The draft law also extends the possibility of exchanging  data  between the Federal Exports Office and other authorities. So  far, the office was allowed to pass data to the customs and  criminal investigation authorities. This is to be extended to  include the Federal Intelligence Service (BND), the Federal  Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), and  environmental authorities, which has so far only been possible  in connection with specific export license applications.  According to the government, the details the Federal Exports  Office requires from the BND and the BfV are data on foreign  customers and arms acquisition organizations.</p>

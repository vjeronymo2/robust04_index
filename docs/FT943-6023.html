			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / The IRA Ceasefire: Next step hangs on the missing word The ceasefire is complete - but is it permanent? On that question yesterday hinged what happens next in the Northern Ireland peace process. When it flashed on to news screens at 11.54 am, the IRA's statement contained many fine phrases and much grounds for optimism. But it pointedly avoided committing the organisation to the permanent cessation of violence which London and Dublin have demanded before allowing Sinn Fein into political talks on the province's future. Instead it promised a 'complete cessation of military operations' as of midnight last night. It might seem churlish to quibble over semantics on one of the most historic days in the province's recent history. But IRA leaders must have known that their statement would be judged by many on the basis of whether it committed them to a permanent ceasefire. It seems inconceivable, therefore, that the word's exclusion was not carefully judged and deliberate. This was certainly the view of unionists, who quickly warned that the statement did not fulfil the two governments' terms. Mr James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist party leader, said bluntly it could not 'trigger' the countdown of the three-month period within which London has promised to enter preliminary dialogue with Sinn Fein in the event of a permanent end to violence. It is crucial that Mr Molyneaux stays on board if the revitalised peace process is to stand any chance of success. Mr John Major's initial response to the statement, first circulated about lunchtime, was somewhat ambiguous. 'I am greatly encouraged by this, but we need to be clear that this is indeed intended to be a permanent renunciation of violence, that is to say, for good,' he said, implying that the clock would not start ticking without clarification from republican leaders. 'If they are genuinely and irrevocably committed to use only peaceful and democratic methods in the future, then we shall respond positively.' But his exhortation to 'let words now be reflected in deeds,' suggested it might be acceptable for the clarification to take the form of an extended period without violence. Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, later aligned the government firmly with Mr Molyneaux, however, saying that the question of permanency had to be resolved before the government would consider that the three-month period had started. 'This is so important a matter that it ought not to be left at large or able to be the subject of discussion and argument,' Sir Patrick said. His words appeared to open up daylight between the government's stance and the position of Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, who said he thought IRA violence was permanently finished. It also opened the prospect of a tense period of cat-and-mouse politics involving the two governments and republican leaders, similar to that which followed the Downing Street declaration. Under the timetable set out by the government, preliminary talks would begin with Sinn Fein within three months of it receiving the assurances it requires. This would have three purposes: To explore the basis on which Sinn Fein would be admitted to an 'inclusive political talks process'. To exchange views on how Sinn Fein would be able in time to play the same part as the other constitutional parties in Ulster's public life. To examine the practical consequences of ending violence. These practical matters would be expected to include the handing in of IRA weapons, the treatment of IRA prisoners, the question of security and the broadcasting ban on Sinn Fein representatives. Some ministers believe the ban no longer serves any useful purpose and should be lifted as soon as possible. On troop deployment, the government is expected to emphasise that decisions are the responsibility of military commanders. But a reduction of troop strength in response to a reduction in the perceived threat of violence has not been ruled out.</p>

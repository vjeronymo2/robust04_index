			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (11): Eco shopping list WEALTH BEYOND MEASURE: AN ATLAS OF NEW ECONOMICS by Paul Ekins, Mayer Hillman and Robert Hutchison Gaia Books Pounds 9.99, 191 pages RARELY has there been a better time for the environmental movement to formulate new theories about how human development might occur in a way that harms the planet less and spreads wealth more evenly. Wealth Beyond Measure seeks to provide a structure of 'green economics' according to which, its authors explain, the world would develop with the pursuit of industrial growth no longer the main economic objective. The new framework would encompass values including 'tight sustainability constraints', 'positive human values' and 'personal development and quality of life'. Although it is difficult to argue against any of these concepts, the book fails to link them into a convincing alternative vision of how the planet could evolve. Much of the volume appears to have been written by a committee bent on referring to just about every vaguely radical idea of the past 20 years. It thus moves erratically between discussing improvements to the Common Agricultural Policy, the problems of too many cars, and the misdemeanours of Ernest Saunders. There is much that is pious and ill thought-out, as in the pseudoscientific discussion of the connections between environmental damage and technology and in the contentious arguments about the moral fibre of people being harmed by too much shopping. Anyone who wants to think about economics in a different way would find a good check list here of topics, but a less than coherent book.</p>

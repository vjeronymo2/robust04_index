			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 25 (KCNA) -- The dear leader  Comrade Kim Chong-il received a solidarity message from Nina  Andreyeva, general secretary of the Central Committee of the  All-Union Bolshevik Communist Party, on the second anniversary  of the publication of the Pyongyang declaration.    The solidarity message dated April 14 says the declaration  is  of particular significance in the struggle to defend and advance  the cause of socialism and in strengthening the unity and  solidarity of the international communist and working-class  movements.    It further says:    The All-Union Bolshevik Communist Party calls for the full  achievement of the aim and principles of the Pyongyang  declaration and it is conducting activities to check the return  to capitalism and reconstruct the Union of Soviet Socialist  Republics.    We will, in the future, too, extend every possible political  support to the peoples struggling for defence of their freedom  and independence against imperialism and for the victory of  socialism in our planet.    The All-Union Bolshevik Communist Party highly appreciates  the role of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and you, the  dear leader, and the Workers' Party of Korea in the publication  of the Pyongyang declaration which opened up a new phase for the  unity of the world communist movement and revolutionary movement.</p>

			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / International Capital Markets: Options market in bid to expand retail business EFFORTS to revive trading of individual UK stock options following the merger of the London International Financial Futures Exchange (Liffe) and the London Traded Options Market (LTOM) will centre on attracting more retail business to the market. 'We have never had the heart and soul - or the portfolio, or the cheque book  -of the private client,' said Mr Geoffrey Chamberlain, former chairman of LTOM, speaking yesterday at a seminar on the future of the equity options market, organised by Futures and Options World. 'There cannot be a successful stock options market without private client business. We should not be afraid of using the word speculation to apply to a certain part of the market.' The business plan for equity options being prepared by Liffe will focus on educating retail investors, according to Mr Michael Jenkins, chief executive of the merged exchange. One reason for their desertion from the market - apart from the crash of 1987 - was that many banks and brokers became increasingly disinterested in serving retail clients. But the focus on retail participation was disputed by some market participants, who pointed to the broad trend away from retail investment towards collective investment schemes. 'You need a bull market to attract retail investors,' said one. Nevertheless, the bid to attract retail business is already under way elsewhere. Five US exchanges have agreed to commit Dollars 2m annually for the next three years in an effort to rejuvenate equity options trading. Traditionally high, the level of US participation has been slipping in the past few years. The money will be spent on television and print advertising and a system of seminars, according to Mr David Hall of the Chicago Board Options Exchange. Among the barriers to a successful market identified, traders and fund managers were particularly concerned by the lack of transparency in the underlying stock market. Currently, there is a 90 minute deadline for marketmakers to report large trades. This is to be extended this year to 24 hours. As a result, marketmakers in equity options will suffer from the lack of transparency, which will in turn have some impact on the potential liquidity of the equity options market. In a questionnaire completed by fund managers and traders attending the conference, poor liquidity was cited as the main reason for not using the market, followed by lack of support from trustees and wide dealing spreads. 'Fear of getting it wrong' was ranked lowest. One advantage of the merger is already being demonstrated. According to figures released by the London Clearing House, which clears all products traded on the merged market, the total amount of margin for equity options halved during the first week's trading from Pounds 220m to Pounds 100m. The clearing house attributed the swing to the introduction of SPAN, Liffe's portfolio-based method of margining, for equity options and to the change to a principal-to-principal clearing system, which allows members to pay margin net rather than gross.</p>

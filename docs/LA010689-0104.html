			<p><P> January 6, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ESPN GETS CABLE RIGHTS TO BASEBALL, STARTING IN 1990  </P> <P> Calling it an exceptional deal for baseball fans, Commissioner Peter Ueberroth  Thursday announced that ESPN has acquired cable television rights to major  league baseball, beginning in 1990.  </P> <P> ESPN, which got the rights with a 4-year, $400-million agreement, will televise  175 games a season, with single games Sunday and Wednesday nights and  doubleheaders Tuesday and Friday evenings.  </P> <P> The cable network will also televise games on opening day and holidays and will  show 6 to 10 spring training games.  </P> <P> "Fans will now be able to see all the teams from both leagues," Ueberroth said.  "Also, ESPN will be able to switch from one game to another. If a kid pitcher  up from the minors is pitching a no-hitter for the Texas Rangers, ESPN can pick  up that game in the ninth inning."  </P> <P> Asked about fans who can't get cable or can't afford it, Ueberroth said: "The  number of games on free over-the-air television is continuing to increase.  Also, cable is now available in 87% of the homes in the country and it could be  90% by the time this package takes effect."  </P> <P> ESPN is in 50.1 million homes, or 55.5% of the nation's television households.  </P> <P> Thursday's deal was announced less than a month after CBS agreed to a 4-year,  $1-billion-plus contract to televise the playoffs, World Series, All-Star game  and 12 regular-season games.  </P> <P> ESPN outbid Turner Broadcasting, SportsChannel America and the USA network for  the cable package. Ueberroth said ESPN and Turner were the finalists.  </P> <P> The package also includes:  </P> <P>  -- A special half-hour highlights show every weeknight.  </P> <P>  -- Coverage of the Equitable Old-Timers All-Star game as well as additional  All-Star game-related programming.  </P> <P>  -- A season-opening special.  </P> <P>  -- Special World Series programming.  </P> <P> Ueberroth said superstations such as Chicago's WGN and Atlanta's TBS would  continue televising baseball.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COUNCIL ELECTION FOR LAGUNA HILLS  </P> <P> On June 6 I was elected to the Laguna Hills City Council. But I can't serve. In  the same election, the Laguna Hills cityhood proposal was narrowly defeated.  There is no city for the city council to govern.  </P> <P> This is not the first time that I have had the dubious distinction of being  elected to a non-existent city council. In November, 1988, I ran as a council  candidate opposed to the different, and much larger, proposed incorporation of  a Saddleback Valley city. Ironically, I was elected to the council of the  Saddleback city, which I helped to defeat.  </P> <P> While I sincerely appreciate the trust and confidence repeatedly expressed by  my fellow residents, I have little tangible evidence of these victories except  for a large campaign debt! But, coming to know and work with many fine,  concerned residents of Laguna Hills, Leisure World and the surrounding  neighborhoods and cities, has made it all worthwhile. I thank each of them for  their interest in the cityhood issue, and for their support of my candidacies.  </P> <P> And, when our community next votes on incorporation, and selects a city  council, maybe I'll get it right.  </P> <P> CRAIG SCOTT  </P> <P> Laguna Hills  </P></p>

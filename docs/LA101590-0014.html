			<p><P> October 15, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JACK SMITH: SEX, VIOLENCE AND TV DINNERS: WHAT IS MORE CIVILIZED?  </P> <P> To my surprise, I have received nothing but support against the La Jolla woman  who called my wife and me uncivilized for eating microwave dinners on trays  while watching sex and violence on television.  </P> <P> My wife has suggested that I write no more about our dining habits, but I know  her concern is not personal. She is simply afraid that I am overdoing it. She  is probably right, as usual; but having been accused of barbarism, I think it  is only fair that I be permitted to offer some contrary opinions.  </P> <P> Some point out, as I did, that civilized people are not necessarily good  people: "Civilized people killed off the majority of the Native Americans in an  attempt to 'civilize' them," writes Diane Silver of Arleta. "Civilized people  demanded that Hawaiians, Africans and the above-mentioned Americans worship,  dress and talk as they (the 'civilized' people) did. Civilized people spread  smallpox, venereal diseases and other benefits of civilization."  </P> <P> "Being civilized," writes Deanna Williams of Monterey Park, "means having the  ability, freedom and opportunity to do what one wants to do, whether it is  eating gourmet meals at the dining-room table while reciting Shakespeare or  eating microwave dinners in front of the TV. Personally, I consider the efforts  involved in cooking to be decidedly barbaric and microwaving to be the only  civilized solution."  </P> <P> "A pox on these small-minded, smug, opinionated 'civilized' people," writes Joy  Logie of Riverside. "I believe, like beauty, civilized is in the eye of the  beholder. To me, Mr. and Mrs. Smith, you are regally civilized."  </P> <P> Some argued that the pleasures of dining en famille are exaggerated. Maxine  Schneiderman of Studio City recalls that when her three children were at home,  the dinner hour was a time for airing grievances, reporting on the day's  activities, discussing current events and engaging in stimulating conversation.  </P> <P> "As it turned out, it was also a time for whining, tattling, kicking one  another under the table, food fights and encouraging a sibling to laugh with a  mouth filled with food or drink. Occasionally we were regaled with punching,  teasing and major-league belching contests. Invariably, someone left the table  in tears. So much for civility.  </P> <P> "We somehow managed to hang on to our sanity and marital status throughout  those fun-filled years of tabled togetherness. Now the frolickers are free to  perform at their own tables, leaving us to dining a deux, thoroughly content to  let the TV do the talking while we do the eating. Whatever highlights of our  day we feel hard-pressed to share fit easily into commercial time. . . ."  </P> <P> Now there is a civilized couple.  </P> <P> Margo Johnson of Redondo Beach writes that there is no romance in cooking for  two: "I really identify with losing interest in fussing over the evening meal.  No matter how many cookbooks and wonderful recipes one has, cooking for two is  a waste of time. With just two faces left around our dinner table, my fervor  over the evening meal has gone."  </P> <P> On the other hand, I did raise some heat with my idea of asking my wife to cook  a dinner from one of her recipe books and serve it on the dining room table so  we could talk the whole thing over.  </P> <P> "What would be wrong with you and your wife preparing a home-cooked meal to be  served on the dining room table while talking the whole thing over?" asks Ellie  Schiff Bernard. "There is a barbaric, uncivilized person at the Jack Smith  house but it isn't Mrs. Smith."  </P> <P> "No, Mr. Smith," writes Margarete Connolly of San Francisco. "One of these days  you have a home-cooked dinner waiting for your wife when she comes home and  then you talk it over."  </P> <P> "I do not want to come off here with too much of a blazing feminist attack,"  graciously writes Jan Brown of Panorama City, "because you are in most ways a  joy. However, surely in your wife's collection of perhaps 1,000 cookbooks,  there are one or two meals that you might be able to rustle up for the TV  trays.  </P> <P> "While I might not find the state of your dining room table or your choice of  where to eat barbaric or uncivilized, I certainly find your matter-of-fact  placement of all meal preparation responsibility on your wife to be, at the  least, archaic. One of these days, why don't you cook a home-cooked meal and  have it waiting for your wife when she gets home from work?"  </P> <P> The last time I tried preparing dinner from a recipe was years ago, when our  boys were small. One Saturday afternoon when my wife was gone we decided to  surprise her by cooking veal parmigiana. When she walked in we had sauce on the  kitchen ceiling.  </P> <P> But I have decided to meet the challenge. I have already picked my recipe. It  is Lamb Chops with Gjetost Sauce. I found it in one of my wife's cookbooks.  </P> <P> Stand by for a full report. (If I can't get gjetost, of course, I'll have to  skip it.)  </P></p>

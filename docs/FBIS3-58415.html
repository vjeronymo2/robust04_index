			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Herbert Kremp: "The Determination Is There To </F> an Extent"]    [Text] President Clinton is seeking a formula for ensuring  European security, which is now more threatened than in the days  of the old East-West conflict and its stable rituals. Regional  wars are being zealously fought. Russia is divided between weak  reform forces and revisionism regarding that disastrous end to  claims of being a world power. Ukraine, whose concessions on  the nuclear weapons issue were triumphantly announced by  Clinton, is a victim: It is giving in to Russian pressure in the  form of rationing energy supplies. NATO is not assuming any  more security guarantees. Partnership for Peace can be viewed as  an achievement on the part of the alliance or a Russian success,  depending on one's point of view, location, and proximity or  distance to the east.    The indications are that the Serbs will be victorious in  Bosnia. The West is growing weary of the conflict. There is an  antipathy toward all the "parties to the conflict"; those who  know best say that they are all unreasonable. No one asks who  is to blame for the war. Habsburg's resignation is apparent  among the Central Europeans that Clinton met in Prague. Bosnia  and the West is a warning sign.    There was no discussion of expanding NATO to the north at  the  meeting of the alliance. Yalta is being recalled in Finland, to  which Zhirinovskiy has already laid claim. Let us assume that  the country wants to become a NATO peace partner and -- U.S.  Defense Secretary Aspin talked of "self-selection" [preceding  word in English] -- opts for the offer of joint maneuvers. How  would the Russians react, like Yeltsin overshadowed by the  radicals? Would they protest (Finland has a border with Russia  that is 1,300 kilometers long) and what would the West do?    The Baltic states remain under pressure, and Poland, for the  sake of which Britain declared war in 1939 but did not  intervene, is disappointed. Slovakia was not mentioned as an  example among the countries to which partnership has been  offered.    In Moscow, Clinton will be asked what the treaties that  could  be concluded with NATO would mean in operational terms.    Yeltsin cannot -- this is to be assumed -- tolerate what  would even be a harmless move closer to NATO, except if Moscow  were to join in and could drill on the territory of its former  satellites once again. As Russia has had success with its  objections, it will shortly seek to obtain further successes  with the detailed definition of the new partnership arrangements.    The question that arises is to what extent is there  sufficient determination and unity not only to "open up" the  alliance eastward -- those are just word games -- but also to  draw the East into Western security structures. If American  policy -- as would seem to be the case -- is geared toward doing  "everything possible" for the beleaguered Yeltsin, it must allow  itself to be dictated "almost everything" by the patient, who  can point to the consequences for his health every time the West  becomes agitated. His generals and radicals might recommend a  security vacuum in East Central and northern Europe for medical  reasons. Can the West -- with its premises -- deal with that?    If Clinton has set a course, it does not apply to the  European states between the alliance and Russia but to the  Russians and the West Europeans. In Brussels, the president  provided a first answer to the questions: Will the United  States remain a leading power in Europe? Will it continue to be  in a position -- politically and militarily -- to provide the  resources for such a commitment? After a year as a president  preoccupied with domestic matters, Clinton has opted for: Yes,  the Americans will remain; they will remain with 100,000 men.  They are, as Clinton said, "naturally also" a reserve for the  event of crises close to Europe (forward deployment). However,  they are in Europe. Moscow will understand that correctly: The  Soviet Union had to abandon its forward positions, but the  United States does not have to. There has to be a difference in  rank.    That, of course, does not mean that the U.S. policy on  Europe  has been thoroughly thought out. Such commitments depend on the  internal situation in a country more than ever before. It also  depends on the personality of the president himself. Bush  wanted to lead, and for that reason he was skeptical about the  WEU -- a European organization whose military significance was  zero. With Clinton, it was possible to easily reach an  agreement: If the WEU wants to do something some day, it can  use certain NATO command centers. Please do it, go ahead --  there is something ironic about this consensus. The Americans  will remain militarily present in Germany. That is important  for the insecure country. At the same time, the result of the  NATO conference -- "partnership" -- is not as much a victory as  a semi-defeat for the German side. The U.S. concept restricts  Germany's room for maneuver in its policy toward the East. EU  [European Union] limits are being followed by NATO limits.    Perhaps, the German Government does not want to function  without such restrictions. Ruehe was quite alone in thinking  about a Germany surrounded solely by NATO states ("friends") and  in speaking out in favor of expanding the alliance and its  security guarantees. As effectively the strongest alliance state  in Europe, Germany would have greatly gained in influence. The  significance is obvious: The eastern part of Central Europe is  a neighboring region and the security vacuum already starts on  the territory of the former GDR. The issue is about interests.  Ruehe was considered wrong. Ruehe is not Kohl, and Kohl does  not necessarily support Ruehe and his bolder concept for Central  Europe.</p>

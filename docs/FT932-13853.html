			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Recovery buying sends market higher A LONDON market already gripped by 'recovery fever' galloped ahead during late trading. It closed a whisker off the day's high as dealers picked up the scent of an imminent and big corporate deal or takeover bid. Those hints have fuelled much of the strong London buying in recent sessions. The deal/bid stories grew in strength after a sudden and substantial upsurge in the Footsie future, which finished at a healthy premium to its estimated fair value. Already boosted by growing optimism and further evidence about the pace of economic recovery in the UK, plus highly encouraging news on a rapid slowing in mortgage arrears and repossessions, the FT-SE 100 Index settled 26.1 up at 2,856.1, having moved smoothly through the 2,850 level. Dealers were impressed at the rise in equities after the gilts market gave ground after a March public sector borrowing requirement of Pounds 9.5bn, well in excess of most estimates, which were around Pounds 8bn. Equity trading got off to a brisk start, with the market driven higher principally by strong gains in the pharmaceuticals, stores and banks sectors. Drugs shares were helped by good first-quarter figures from Merck, the world's biggest pharmaceuticals company, announced overnight. The impetus for the hefty gains in the banks, retailers and building-related sectors came from the latest evidence of UK recovery detailed in the Confederation of British Industry survey. The survey revealed that retail sales had risen on a year-on-year basis for the third consecutive month and were at their highest since November 1991. The market now awaits confirmation of the upturn in retail sales when official figures for March are released on Friday. Tomorrow brings news of unemployment figures for March. Economists have forecast a sharp rise in unemployment during March of around 35,000 after the surprising 22,000 decline in February. Buying by the big institutions was said to have been consistent throughout the session and ignoring the disappointing opening by Wall Street, which was hit early on by news of lower than forecast housing starts and was showing a loss of around 15 Dow points as London closed. The late burst of bid speculation encompassed numerous sectors. TSB raced up, with the ever present takeover stories accompanied by suggestions that the Hill Samuel merchant banking business, acquired for Pounds 777m on the eve of the great stock market crash in 1987, is about to be sold. In a building sector galvanised by recent news of increased house sales and yesterday's news from Abbey National of a sharp rise in mortgage lending and falling repossessions, Pilkington and Tarmac moved up strongly as talk of possible bid moves by MB-Caradon revived. Abbey shares were among the Footsie's best performers after the encouraging agm statement. Bank shares generally outperformed, although some industry specialists pointed out that the sector, at a 20-year relative high, was dangerously overbought and due a severe correction in the short term. The 10 per cent decline in water shares over the past week triggered a strong rally in the sector, prompted by Kleinwort Benson and Panmure Gordon. Market turnover of 543.4m shares was described as mildly disappointing.</p>

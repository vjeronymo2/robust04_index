			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (45): Airlanes congested - Anxiety over safety in the skies THE RAPID expansion of China's aviation industry is straining the country's ability to maintain adequate safety standards, according to Western aviation experts. The proliferation of airlines, coupled with the purchase of so many aircraft in the world's fastest growing aviation market, has triggered alarm among senior Chinese leaders and western experts about just how safe the country's skies really are. 'Their idea of aviation is aeroplanes,' a western businessman said. 'It's almost as an afterthought that the Chinese consider maintenance, the training of pilots, and airports to handle passengers.' Indeed, since the mid-1980s the growth in the passenger and freight markets has soared to 25 per cent a year. Even with a projected slower growth rate of less than 20 per cent annually through the end of the century, western businessmen estimate that Chinese airlines will continue to need 50 planes a year for the next decade. To meet this demand, foreign aircraft manufacturers are flocking to China. Boeing Corporation and Airbus Industrie have been market leaders. In the spring of this year, Chinese airlines bought 21 Boeing jetliners, making a total of 150 Boeings either leased or sold to the country since 1972, when China placed its first order with the American manufacturer. China has also purchased 12 aircraft from Airbus this year. Prior to that sale, altogether the European consortium has sold 17 aircraft to Chinese airlines. Making the skies safer depends on making improvements in several vital areas: air traffic control, radar, ground equipment and pilot shortages. China'a air space is controlled by the military and civilian airlines must request use of it. Civilian aircraft are allotted narrow corridors within which to fly and cannot deviate out of them. With more aircraft flying in the same air space, western diplomats said the likelihood of an accident increases. The air space problem is compounded by China's severe shortage of radar and ground equipment and navigational and landing systems. 'China is using the same amount of radar to cover more aircraft,' a western diplomat said. 'It is not ready to adequately handle the increase in the number of planes its airlines have acquired. There are even areas in China that have no radar. And if you have no navigational aids, you're in trouble.' Moreover, China lacks a national system of civilian air traffic control. Transferring aircraft from one flight information region to another as it is done in western countries simply does not exist. Pilot training also lags behind the West. Modelled on the Soviet method, pilots are given instructions from air traffic control on the ground, and western diplomats said they are not trained to request permission to alter their original route - 'if you are flying a plane in China, it goes through clouds and turbulence because the pilots don't have the training or leeway to deviate from the course . . . so you end up with a rather bumpy ride.' The difficulties and dangers are compounded by an acute shortage of pilots. The country's only training school, run by the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) and located in Chengdu, Sichuan, turns out 80 pilots annually. Western businessmen estimate the country currently needs a total of at least 600 new pilots. Because of the pilot shortage, pilots fly longer hours than they should. The drive to be profitable has also led to overloading aircraft with passengers and cargo, and to aircraft flying when they should be grounded for inspections and maintenance. Since July last year, China has had five reported accidents, which killed 331 people. Even within the first two weeks of a 100-day safety campaign for the Chinese air force, two F-7 fighters collided, killing both pilots. Given all of these safety problems, the Chinese are attempting to improve safety standards - 'safety, safety, safety - the order has come from the top. The State Council has said safety is a first priority,' a western businessman says. In response to this pressure, the military has grudgingly agreed to release control of some of the air space to CAAC, but western diplomats say the armed forces have been slow to implement this policy.</p>

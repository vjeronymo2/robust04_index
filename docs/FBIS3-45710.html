Officials of Korea have recently held secret talks with  Australian diplomats in Jakarta and Bangkok on the reopening of  diplomatic dialogue between the two governments, the spokesman  said.    The move came 19 years after diplomatic ties between the two  countries broke down in 1975 when Australia backed South Korea  in the United Nations.    The Australian Government is considering the proposal by the  DPRK, but "no decisions have been made at present", the  spokesman stressed.    However, it will be "an option" for Australia to invite a  North Korean official at junior minister level to visit Canberra  later this year to discuss the issue, he said.    It is understood that Australia has made it clear that some  conditions will have to be met by Pyongyang before the ties  between the two countries can be renewed.    The conditions include North Korea allowing international  inspectors into the country to examine its nuclear facilities  and resumption of high-level talks between North Korea, South  Korea and the United States.    If Australia restores diplomatic links with the DPRK, it  will  be the first English-speaking western country to do so.    The Australian Government has informed the U.S., Japan and  South Korea of the approach by the DPRK, the spokesman said.</p>

			<p><P> December 12, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY IN NEWHALL GETS ROAD NOBODY WANTS TO USE  </P> <P> It's Santa Clarita's newest road. And with any luck, its builders say, it will  never be used.  </P> <P> The gated, mile-long road was built to give a secluded Newhall neighborhood an  emergency escape route in case of fire, earthquake or other disaster. The  neighborhood, known as the Circle J development, is accessible only by Circle J  Ranch Road, which crosses railroad tracks that parallel San Fernando Road.  </P> <P> Residents have complained for years that the community of 500 households could  be cut off from firefighters or police if a train stalls or derails, blocking  the road. The two-lane emergency road connects Circle J Ranch Road with 12th  Street, which crosses the railroad tracks a mile to the south.  </P> <P> On Monday, officials from Santa Clarita and Watt America, the Circle J  developer, announced that the road was ready for use. Richard S. Urso,  president of Watt America, said it will cost his company about $1 million to  build the road and provide security guards for a three-year period. A guard  will watch the gate 24 hours a day, a condition imposed by the city.  </P> <P> The guards will open the gate during emergencies or when a train blocks Circle  J Ranch Road for more than 20 minutes, he said. Urso said he hopes the guards  never have to unlock the gate.  </P> <P> The city required the road to remain closed except in emergencies. It is  unsuitable for everyday use because it crosses a dry riverbed and is not  lighted, Medina said.  </P> <P> The emergency road will no longer be necessary once the city builds a bridge to  span the railroad tracks, linking Circle J Ranch Road with Wiley Canyon Road  across the Santa Clara River, Medina said.  </P> <P> The Wiley Canyon Bridge, however, will not be built for several years, Medina  said. Watt America is contributing $4.5 million of the $9-million to  $10-million cost of the bridge, he said.  </P></p>

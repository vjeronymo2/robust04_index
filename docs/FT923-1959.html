			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Books: Unsuitable case for treatment - Nigel Spivey comes to the conclusion that the gospel truth is hard to come by JESUS by AN Wilson Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds 15, 269 pages AN WILSON'S biography of CS Lewis was a lovely book, abundant with the contagious grace of its subject. And it may be that the enthusiasm of CS Lewis for the stuff of Christianity - 'the very thing you like in poetry and the romances, only this time it's true' - naturally conducts a biographer to Jesus (as it did Humphrey Carpenter). The challenge of 'this time it's true' is enough to tickle the interest of any investigative hack, the opportunities to demythologise are legion; and to a biographer who is also a novelist, the temptation to explore the play of personalities in the Gospels must be almost irresistible. But as Wilson fully admits, Jesus is wholly unsuitable for biography. Despite the Dead Sea scrolls and sundry archaeological clarifications of life in first century AD Palestine, little can be added to the well-known corpus of sources for Jesus's life. The scrolls put detail on a claim made over a century ago, by Ernest Renan, that Christianity was simply 'an Essene sect that succeeded'; otherwise, nothing supplements the Gospels but apocrypha, and of the making of apocrypha there is no end. The latest whimsy  -Jesus the Man by Barbara Thiering (Doubleday Pounds 16.99) - is that Jesus regained consciousness after his crucifixion and lived till 70 pottering about in the company of the other evangelists until his retirement (with second wife and family) to the South of France. What value is to be fixed on those well-known primary sources, then? Wilson's main problem is that neither John nor the Synoptic Gospels accommodate his recognition of them as direct 'reportage' in some parts and superb literary fabrications in others. He says that 'there are moments in the New Testament where one has the sensation of having only just missed the Presence' (without specifying); but equally he wants the Gospel writers to be interpolators of entirely fictional devices, such as the suicide of Judas. So when it comes to tricky points of New Testament exegesis, for example the inconsistencies between the accounts of the trial of Jesus, Wilson disowns all difficulty by asserting that none of the Gospel writers knows 'anything about Jewish legal procedures'. He snaps up what trifles he can (Jesus, it seems, was ignorant of the dimensions of a fully-grown mustard tree), and tries to stay flinty when describing the grief-steeped episodes of the Passion. But this is a disorganised attempt at objectivity, from an author who is perfectly sensible to the moral cogency of Jesus's teaching but suspicious both of its foundations and of its conversion into the vaults and structures of the Christian church. 'There is no historical task which so reveals a man's true self as the writing of a life of Jesus': thus Albert Schweitzer, who tried it. Wilson's study carries the stigmata of one who is a renegade ordinand and renegade scholar, and it is hard to see what sort of reader he is seeking to satisfy. Practising Christians will be duly needled by his throwaway jabs in their direction ('Few of the Christian churches have ever viewed the teaching of Jesus with anything but contempt'); and New Testament pedants will be irritated by his bold dabbling in exegesis and facile citations of Professor So-and-So. This is, frankly, the country of the blind, and I cannot salute AN Wilson as its one-eyed king. His own natural tincture of scepticism ought to have served him better: the problems presented by the supposedly 'historical' evidence, which he outlines in his Preface and recalls throughout the main text, do indeed prove insurmountable. So he, too, resorts to the same speculation he derides in others. He suggests, on the feeblest of philological reasonings, that the High Priest's servant aurally impaired in the Garden of Gethsemane by Simon Peter was none other than a young St. Paul. 'If I had the chance to return in time and meet Paul, I should take a close look at his ears' - a comment which illustrates Wilson's accessible but flippant style throughout. Then he hazards that the man seen on the road to Emmaus was James, the brother of Jesus. To be fair, he glosses such guesswork with 'I believe that', 'it would not be impossible to suppose', etc., but no partisan of 'Gospel truth' is going to feel threatened by these half-baked hypotheses. If there are people hungry to know what can be known about the historical Jesus, they would do as well to ignore this essay and stay with Humphrey Carpenter's, which is cheaper and considerably more disciplined.</p>

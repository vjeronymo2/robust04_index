			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / People: Scheele brings Padilla to Jaguar from US Nick Scheele, who took over as chairman and chief executive of Jaguar in April, has his first key appointment in place at the troubled luxury car manufacturer. He is 46-year-old James Padilla, who was born in Detroit and who has spent almost his entire working life there since he joined Ford in 1966. Padilla arrives as Scheele's number two, with the title of executive director of engineering and manufacturing - a new and key position at the British company which has proved an extremely expensive proposition for Ford since the US car giant's 1989 purchase. The two men know each other from the mid-1980s when Scheele was running the purchasing budget for the North American assembly plants. Scheele's predecessor, Bill Hayden, a leading manufacturing expert, previously from Ford Europe, likened the production facilities at Jaguar to a plant in Gorky when he was first put in following the acquisition. When he retired, he left a large gap on the engineering and manufacturing side. The directors responsible for those areas, who had previously reported to Hayden, are now reporting to Padilla. Since 1991 Padilla has been director of the small car segment within North American product development. An engineering graduate, he had been made programme operations manager in 1990. He had a year out of Ford in 1978 on a White House fellowship programme. Jaguar claims that Hayden made great strides forward in terms of productivity, and, particularly, quality. Padilla will be continuing in that vein, and will also be in charge of what is a highly ambitious new model programme - with plans for a new saloon and sports car as well as a smaller executive car to compete in the BMW 5-series market.</p>

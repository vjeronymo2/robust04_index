			<p>BFN     [Text] [Excerpt] [passage omitted] No major decisions were  made. The balance sheet was viewed as positive, although some  questions are still pending, as [Economy] Minister Edmond  Alphandery explained to Norbert Navarron:    [Begin recording] [Alphandery] Today's meeting reinforces  our  feeling that we are on the right track. Above all, we must not  let our guard down, and I am very happy to see that all my  colleagues, the finance ministers of the franc zone, are well  aware of the need to continue making the effort, in particular  with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank and with  France's support.    [Navarron] What matters still need to be settled urgently in  the franc zone following the devaluation?    [Alphandery] There are matters to be looked at, and my  colleagues noted in particular the problem of medical supplies,  which greatly concerns them and it is a question that we are  going to look at with them.    [Navarron] Does this mean that operational decisions will be  made very quickly?    [Alphandery] Such decisions have already been made. We have  not been idle. Mr Roussin [development minister] has, moreover,  taken a great deal of trouble to follow the progression of  events in all of the countries following the devaluation, and we  are naturally continuing to follow the progression of events  very closely. I would even say we are following events on a day  to day basis in each of the countries. [end recording]</p>

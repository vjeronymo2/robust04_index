			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Japan's Long Absence in International </F> Economics"]    [Text] The cabinet-level directors meetings of the  Organization for Economic Development and Cooperation (OECD) are  normally forums for preparing the agenda for advanced nation  summit conferences, but the recent meeting was in a sense a  milestone for the global economic system in the post-Cold War  era.    The cabinet-level directors meeting agreed to handle the  employment issue, which is a common concern of advanced nations  from both a macroeconomic policy and structural policy.  Structural unemployment cannot be resolved merely by relying on  the stimulation of demand based on macroeconomic policies; and a  change in the structural situation leading to the creation of  jobs by attempting to resolve the problem by structural  policies, in disregard of macro policies, cannot be expected.  There is significance in the cabinet-level directors statement  that emphasizes the synergistic effects of these two policies.    The cabinet-level directors meeting confirmed the launching  of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in January 1995 and  discussed, from the standpoint of advanced nations, the  framework for the next bilateral trade negotiations to include  trade and the environment, trade and labor standards, and trade  and investment. The meeting also resulted in an agreement to  support the membership of South Korea and former East European  nations and to intensify affiliations with nations of other  spheres such as China and Russia.    A regrettable aspect was that Japanese cabinet members were  not present for this valuable international economic conference.  It might have been permissible to limit attendance to  bureaucrats if we were speaking of a common international  conference, but since not a single cabinet member attended the  cabinet-level conference, we probably cannot say that we were in  attendance at the gathering. In comparison with other advanced  nations who dispatched several principal economic cabinet  members, we must say that Japan's presence was hardly noticeable.    This is not an issue of pure formality on the question of  whether or not a nation should attend a conference. The problem  here is that the situation is reflective of Japan's posture  concerning global economic systems.    Japan has always been criticized for its passive posture.  The  recent OECD cabinet-level directors meeting included a request  that Japan expand its domestic demand and reduce its current  account surpluses. Japan always exercises concern over the  intensity of demands lodged with Japan, but it is Japan's option  to expand domestic demand and reduce its surpluses.    Recently, Japan has outdone itself with respect to such  passive postures and has a tendency of isolating itself. At the  Uruguay Round of talks where an agreement was reached on trade  systems for the post-Cold War period, Japan was expected to take  a leading role as foremost benefitting nation, but once the  talks were finished, Japan relegated itself to playing the role  of the persecuted. At the employment summit held in the United  States which was attended by all of the principal economic  cabinet members of the participating nations, Japan was  represented by only the labor minister, giving the Japanese  delegation an inferiority complex. Then, finally, the OECD  cabinet-level directors meeting was held.    The post-Cold War global economy is being affected by an  upheaval of an unprecedented scale. Nations that were in a  developing stage not too long ago have acquired manufacturing  capabilities of a level equal to those of advanced nations and  have launched an offensive against world markets, taking  advantage of low labor rates. That situation underlies the  unemployment issue in advanced nations.    It is of extreme importance to consider the formulation of a  new global economic framework without lapsing into  protectionism. The respective nations will no doubt listen to  any proposals that Japan might have as a nation with the dual  position of a foothold in Asia and as an advanced nation.    Japan's absence from the global economic system has been too  long. Not only is such a stance contrary to Japan's national  interests, but runs the risk of posing an obstacle to the  balanced management of the world economy.</p>

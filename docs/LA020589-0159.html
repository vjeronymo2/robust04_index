			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WCAC ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> LOYOLA FINDS TOUCH, BEATS SAN DIEGO, 139-104  </P> <P> Loyola Marymount rediscovered its shooting touch Saturday night and Hank  Gathers decided to add passing to his repertoire in a 139-104 runaway over the  University of San Diego before a sellout of 4,085 at Gersten Pavilion.  </P> <P> With the victory, Loyola pulled into a second-place tie with St. Mary's in the  West Coast Athletic Conference, one game behind Pepperdine.  </P> <P> In its highest-scoring conference game of the season, Loyola took control in  the early minutes. So for variety, Gathers -- the nation's scoring and  rebounding leader -- went to work on his passing. He finished with 30 points,  14 rebounds and 9 assists.  </P> <P> "I could lead the nation in assists if I wanted to," Gathers said.  </P> <P> Many of Gathers' assists came on 3-pointers. Loyola (13-2 overall, 6-2 in the  conference) made 14 of 25 3-point shots, outscoring the Toreros from 3-point  range, 42-9. Jeff Fryer, Enoch Simmons and Bo Kimble made 4 each.  </P> <P> San Diego (6-14, 1-7) was outscored by only 20 points in its 7 previous WCAC  games.  </P> <P> Reserve Craig Cottrell had 26 points and 8 rebounds, Wayman Strickland added 21  points and Gylan Dottin had 14 points for the Toreros.  </P> <P> Loyola took control after a 21-20 lead with a 42-9 run to take a 63-29  advantage with 5 minutes left in the first half.  </P> <P> Loyola got its 3-point shooting warmed up and made 7 of 15 on the way to a  73-48 halftime lead. Fryer and Simmons combined for five 3-pointers and each  had 17 points in the first half.  </P> <P> The Lions made their first 14 free throws before missing one just before  halftime. They made 19 of 26 free throws overall, to San Diego's 11 of 22.  </P> <P> Loyola maintained 30-point leads the rest of the game, reaching the 100-point  mark with nearly 12 minutes left, 101-64. The lead increased to 117-77 with  8:25 left as Per Stumer made two consecutive 3-pointers.  </P> <P> Fryer finished with 29 points, Simmons 25 and Kimble 22 as the Lions shot 55%  for the game. San Diego was also hurt by 25 turnovers.  </P> <P> "It's nice when we have it greased," Lion Coach Paul Westhead said of the  team's accurate shooting. "At halftime I told the guys, 'Hank is giving up the  ball.' That's a very bright sign. He has every reason to shoot. Every time he  passes he can get an assist because he always has three people on him."  </P> <P> Westhead was also pleased to see a good offensive effort on the heels of Friday  night's 116-104 loss to St. Mary's, a defeat he felt came because of his team's  scoring shortcomings rather than St. Mary's defense.  </P> <P> "At the shootaround today we emphasized the break, no matter what," he said.  "San Diego got 104. We can absorb (opponents') easy baskets. But we have to be  up around 130." ALAN DROOZ USF 62, Gonzaga 50 -- Joel DeVortoli scored 20  points and Mark McCathrion added 17 points and 12 rebounds to pace the Dons at  San Francisco. USF is 12-9 and 4-4, and Gonzaga is 12-9 and 3-6. USF won with a  tough defense by holding Gonzaga's two leading scorers, Jim McPhee and Doug  Spradley, to a total of 21 points on 5-of-20 shooting from the floor. Gonzaga  came into the game as the nation's leading 3-point shooting team, but made only  1 of 10 shots. The closest Gonzaga got in the second half was 46-42 with 9:38  left, but USF then had a 14-3 spurt over the next four minutes to gain a  15-point lead and put the game out of reach. Santa Clara 72, Portland 65 --  Jens Gordon scored 24 points and had 10 rebounds to lead the Broncos past the  Pilots at Santa Clara. Santa Clara (15-6, 4-4) scored the first 16 points and  led, 34-27, at halftime. Portland (1-20, 1-7) cut the lead to 5 points with  14:38 left on a layup by Josh Lowery. The Broncos extended the lead to 11  points with 9:08 remaining on a layup by Jeffty Connelly. The Pilots never got  closer than 5 points. The victory was the 300th for Santa Clara Coach Carroll  Williams. Lowery was the leading scorer for Portland with 25 points.  </P></p>

The annual amount payable by companies is limited to a maximum of 1 per cent of premium income. The Lords ruled that several thousand US policyholders could claim compensation even though they were not resident in the UK. However, it reserved judgment as to whether a number of professional partnerships could be considered as private policyholders. Those benefiting from the ruling bought insurance from five LUI subsidiaries  -Kingscoft Insurance, El Paso Insurance, Lime Street Insurance and Mutual Re, collectively known as the KELM companies - and Walbrook Insurance. The Lords' decision upheld rulings in the lower court which define a UK policy as one issued by a UK authorised insurance company operating out of the UK, irrespective of where the risk covered by the policy is located.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 13/5/1994 -- The  professionalization of the Army will be one of the main tasks of  the Defence Ministry in the near future, states to the newspaper  PACEA CIVICA (CIVIC PEACE) Pavel Creanga, Moldovan defense  minister. By late 1995, professionals will represent the  largest portion of military specialists in the Army units and  subdivisions. Later the whole Army, from soldiers to generals,  will become professional. Creanga rejects certain people's  proposals to liquidate the Army. He says that Moldova should  have "sufficiently numerous regular troops mobile and capable of  confronting eventual threats to its security." Referring to the  instruction of officers, Creanga specified that by late 1995 at  "Alexandru cel Bun" Military College courses for retraining  different military specialists will begin. He also said that  other special schools for instructing professional soldiers will  be opened as well. About 100 graduates from the CIS military  schools will begin serving this year in the Defense Ministry.  Many Moldovan Army soldiers are studying in France, Romania,  the U.S.A., and Greece, Says Creanga.</p>

			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / Satellites beam down on winter wheat Mr Brian Welti this week planted the first wheat field in Britain to use US military navigation satellites. Mr Welti, a farm manager at Shuttleworth College farm in Bedfordshire, planted 15 acres of winter wheat using a mapping system developed by Massey Ferguson, the farm equipment maker. His tractor was fitted with global positioning equipment which enabled it to pick up signals from 21 satellites in orbit 12,000 miles above the earth. Mr Welti said: 'This system is such a new application of technology in farming. We think it is going to mean considerable savings both financially and environmentally in the long run, but we don't know how much yet.' The positioning system can improve profits by allowing farmers to sow more seed on fertile parts of their land than on poorer areas. It can also be used to vary the application of fertilisers and agro-chemicals much more accurately in parts of a field with specific problems. This enables farmers to save money by limiting the use of chemicals and farming in a more environmentally-friendly way. Data about the amount of grain produced in any part of a field is collected by a yield meter mounted on a combine harvester during the harvest. This information is used to produce a yield map of the more productive sections. Mr Welti said that yields could vary by as much as 100 per cent across a field. Farmers can use the yield map to draw up a plan for applying seeds, fertilisers or chemicals and feed this, via a disk or smart card, into a tractor's computer. The tractor system uses positioning information signals from the satellites to increase or decrease the amount of seed being planted, according to where it is in the field. Mr Welti said: 'Up till now farmers have just treated a field as a field, but now we know precisely where we're getting a return and where we're not.' The equipment for yield mapping and global positioning costs Pounds 11,500 and can be fitted to most tractors and combine harvesters.</p>

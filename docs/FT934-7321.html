			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Ciampi's fate rides on local elections THE leaders of Italy's main political parties held rallies across the country yesterday urging a heavy turn-out in today's municipal elections. The poll, covering almost 11m voters, a quarter of the electorate, will be an important test of opinion. The outcome is liable to determine the life of Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi's government. Overall, 450 city and town councils are up for renewal. The main interest centres on the big cities. In the north Mr Umberto Bossi's populist League will be seeking to extend its domination. In the last partial municipal elections in June, the League succeeded in its main objective in taking Milan. Elsewhere the long-governing Christian Democrats will be desperately trying to maintain the allegiance of the electorate, especially in the south. The opinion polls suggest they will suffer a sharp loss of support and, for the first time since 1946, will hold no large city. They are expected to lose out to the neo-fascist MSI on the right, and on the left to coalitions sponsored by the former communist Party of the Democratic Left. Under new rules for the direct election of mayors, candidates must either obtain an absolute majority or face a run-off between the top two candidates within two weeks. The backers of the winning mayoral candidate are then allocated 60 per cent of council seats to ensure a stable governing coalition. Lazio soccer club president Sergio Cragnotti was taken to a Milan prison yesterday for questioning after giving himself up to police, Reuter reports. Suspected of false accounting, Mr Cragnotti was managing director of Enimont, an alliance between state energy group Eni and the Ferruzzi agro-industrial group's Montedison, which collapsed after less than two years' activity in 1990.</p>

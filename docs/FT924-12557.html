			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Paribas sees little impact in Ciments Francais crisis PARIBAS, the French banking and investment group, expects only a limited impact from the financial crisis at Ciments Francais, its former cement-making subsidiary, according to Mr Andre Levy-Lang, the chairman. The Paribas share price has fallen sharply this month on the revelation that Ciments Francais had made losses believed to run to hundreds of millions of francs on off-balance sheet financial dealings. Yesterday, Paribas' share price rose by FFr1.5 to FFr311. Last April, Italcementi, the Italian building materials group, agreed to pay FFr6bn (Dollars 1.19m at current rates) for a controlling stake in the already debt-laden Ciments Francais. Mr Levy-Lang also revealed that Paribas's financial trading is weaker in the current six months than it was in the first half of the year. In particular, there had been a sharp drop in the Ecu bond market since the Danish vote against EC monetary and political union in June. However, the impact on Paribas of the recent currency market turmoil was limited. Last year, Paribas made its first ever loss, FFr184m, as against a FFr2.54bn net profit in 1990, reflecting intense competition in French banking and provisions for the value of its property investments.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Alves Antonio in Lusaka] </F>   [Text] In Lusaka, the frame of the negotiations has not  altered. This morning, UN Special Representative Alioune  Blondin Beye, who is mediating the Angolan peace talks, held a  meeting with government representatives and probably yet another  one with the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola  [UNITA]. However, nothing concrete is known about the issues  discussed, since there is an absolute silence around the sides  involved in the negotiating process. Thus, the face-to-face  meeting between the government and UNITA negotiators to discuss  the implementation of the modalities of national reconciliation  has once again been postponed.    Meanwhile, UNITA says that it intends by all means to govern  Huambo Province. This position was reaffirmed in the Zambian  capital during a meeting between the UNITA team and members of  extraparliamentary opposition parties held yesterday. The  latter said that UNITA would not mind continuing holding talks  until the year 2,000. Meanwhile, the government and UNITA teams  will return to Mulungushi this afternoon. Radio Nacional de  Angola has learned from a reliable source that Chief Blondin  Beye will leave for the city of Harare, Zimbabwe, tomorrow, to  hold talks with President Robert Mugabe on the Angolan peace  talk underway in the Zambian capital.</p>

According to official  reports, nearly 100 Turkish citizens received instruction in  religious schools in Qom thus far. All of them have returned to  Turkey.    The General Directorate of Police has drawn up a report on  Iran's reactionary activities against Turkey and submitted it to  high-ranking officials in Ankara a few days ago. CUMHURIYET has  acquired that report. It said that Iran has maintained its  effort to spread the Islamic revolution to Turkey since 1983 and  noted that Tehran's activities pose a threat to Turkey's unity  and security. Stressing that Iran's diplomatic missions and  establishments have an important role in that country's  activities, the report said that the activities aimed at  spreading Iran's revolution are organized within the structure  of Iran's embassy, consulates general, and consulates and the  Iranian officials significantly benefit from their diplomatic  immunity to promote them.    The report listed the diplomatic missions' activities as  follows:    a. Transfer and distribution of propaganda from Iran.    b. Organization of meetings to enlighten Turkish citizens on  the Islamic Revolution.    c. Organization of the activities of Iranian students who  study in Turkey.    d. Organization of the legal or illegal travel of Turkish  citizens who sympathize with Iran's views to Tehran to receive  religious training.    e. Establishment and surveillance of the opponents of the  Iranian regime in Turkey and the individuals and groups that  carry out activities against the Turkish Government.    f. Activities aimed at gathering information on Turkey.    The report stressed that the Iranian cultural centers  spearhead the establishments involved in intensive propaganda  activities and noted that the speakers in the meetings,  seminars, and panel discussions that are held in those centers  address both the Iranian and the Turkish citizens. The report  also drew attention to the question of headdress in the  universities and said that the Iranian missions exploit that  problem and use it as propaganda material in order to influence  the students. Furthermore, it said that the Iranian students  have a significant role in Iran's propaganda activities, which  defend the view that secularism is a state of heresy and  criticize the principles and reforms of Kemal Ataturk, founder  of Turkey. The report stressed that several Iranian students  are responsible for distributing leaflets and documents,  controlling the situation and behavior of Iranian students in  Turkey, selecting Turkish students to be sent to Iran,  establishing contacts with extremist religious groups, and  broadening the propaganda on Iran's revolution and Shia  practices.    The report asserted that publications play an important  role in the Iranian missions' propaganda activities and noted  that Iranian magazines, newspapers, brochures, booklets, and  cassette tapes are dispatched to Turkey in diplomatic pouches.  It stressed: "Meanwhile, the Iranian cultural centers  distribute or mail their publications, including the books they  publish on religious festivals and other important days, to the  Turkish citizens free of charge."    The report said that the Iranian officials have also focused  attention on the Sunni sect in Turkey. It noted the following:  "It is common knowledge that the Iranian officials are making  an intensive effort to weaken the concept of Islam in the Sunni  people and establish non-Shia marginal groups among the  followers of the Sunni sect who will be influenced by the Shia  concept of Islam and will agree that Shia is the true sect in  Islam. In fact, they have had many books, magazines, and other  printed material published by the printing houses they support  to realize their objectives."    Regarding the religious training given to the Turkish  citizens in Iran, the report said: "It is common knowledge that  our citizens are included among the students from the Islamic  countries who attend the religious training programs in Qom for  four or five years, that these programs are based on the Shia  concept of Islam, that the foreign participants in the religious  programs are paid 60-70 Iranian tumans [1 tuman equals 10 rials]  in the form of material aid, that Iran meets all their housing  and training expenses, and that those who complete their  training are used for propaganda purposes in their own  countries. It is also common knowledge that religious training  has been given to nearly 100 Turkish citizens thus far. All of  them have returned to Turkey."</p>

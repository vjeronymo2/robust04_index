			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Data from the case review should be used to determine if there is a need to modify (a) protocols for identifying and isolating patients who may have infectious TB, (b) laboratory procedures, (c) administrative policies and practices, or (d) protocols for patient management.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> f. Observation of TB infection-control practices. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Assessing adherence to the policies of the TB infection-control program should be part of the evaluation process. This assessment should be performed on a regular basis and whenever an increase occurs in the number of TB patients or HCW PPD test conversions. Areas at high risk for transmission of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  should be monitored more frequently than other areas. The review of patient medical records provides information on HCW adherence to some of the policies of the TB infection-control program. In addition, work practices related to TB isolation (e.g., keeping doors to isolation rooms closed) should be observed to determine if employers are enforcing, and HCWs are adhering to, these policies and if patient adherence is being enforced. If these policies are not being enforced or adhered to, appropriate education and other corrective action should be implemented.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> g. Engineering evaluation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Results of engineering maintenance measures should be reviewed at regular intervals (Table 3). Data from the most recent evaluation and from maintenance procedures and logs should be reviewed carefully as part of the risk assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Development of the TB Infection-Control Plan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Based on the results of the risk assessment, a written TB infection-control plan should be developed and implemented for each area of the facility and for each occupational group of HCWs not assigned to a specific area of the facility (Table 2; Table 3).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The occurrence of drug-resistant TB in the facility or the community, or a relatively high prevalence of HIV infection among patients or HCWs in the community, may increase the concern about transmission of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and may influence the decision regarding which protocol to follow (i.e., a higher-risk classification may be selected).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Health-care facilities are likely to have a combination of low-, intermediate-, and high-risk areas or occupational groups during the same time period. The appropriate protocol should be implemented for each area or group.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Areas in which cough-inducing procedures are performed on patients who may have active TB should, at the minimum, implement the intermediate-risk protocol.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Periodic Reassessment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Follow-up risk assessment should be performed at the interval indicated by the most recent risk assessment (Figure 1; Table 2). Based on the results of the follow-up assessment, problem evaluation may need to be conducted or the protocol may need to be modified to a higher- or lower-risk level.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> April 18, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOKS;  </P> <P> BRITISH MOLECULAR BIOLOGIST TAKES SCIENCE OFF THE HOOK  </P> <P> Is Science Necessary? Essays on Science and Scientists by Max F. Perutz (E.P.  Dutton: $19.95; 285 pages)  </P> <P> For the last hundred years or so, society has looked to science as the way to  solve the world's problems. The public-health triumphs of the turn of the  century made people think that knowledge could make all ills disappear.  </P> <P> This was a new role for science. Historically, scientific knowledge had been  pursued largely for its own sake. It was interesting to know about astronomy,  but not much more. The Industrial Revolution used technology for economic and  commercial gain.  </P> <P> But it was not until later that people began to think that scientific insights  could be used broadly to improve health and welfare, an idea that remains a  cornerstone of public support for research to this day.  </P> <P> Never mind that it was easier to wipe out diphtheria and yellow fever than to  wipe out poverty and hunger. Never mind that the application of scientific  knowledge frequently has unfortunate side effects like pollution. The notion is  still very much with us -- at least in most quarters -- that science is the way  to improve the world's standard of living.  </P> <P> This is the view taken by Max F. Perutz, a Nobel Prize-winning British  molecular biologist, in "Is Science Necessary?" a collection of his essays  written over the years. The title of the book is the title of the first and  longest essay in it, and the answer Perutz gives is an emphatic yes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Last Best Hope  </P> <P> Science is not only necessary, it is crucial. In fact, he argues, it offers the  only solution to the problems of food, health and energy that confront the  world. There are simply too many people on the planet to get by without it.  </P> <P> Perutz is aware -- as who isn't? -- that knowledge has a downside. "Science  often exacts a price," he writes. "Benefits and risks are complementary aspects  of each technical advance." But he comes down foursquare on the side of the  benefits and has little patience for nostalgia for the simpler good old days,  which, he says, weren't so good.  </P> <P> "Both the Irish potato famine of the last century and the great Bengal famine  of the 1930s were caused by fungi attacking crops," he writes. "If we reverted  to organic farming without fungicides, we would not be able to prevent a  repetition of these disasters."  </P> <P> That is the overall argument of the essay, and it is undoubtedly true, though  it is unlikely to persuade those who focus on the risks of science rather than  on its benefits.  </P> <P> Perutz's essay is a powerful restatement of what many people believe and what  those who don't are not likely to. It's an important essay, but it doesn't tell  us much that's new.  </P> <P> Oddly, the remaining essays in the book are more engaging. They deal with  smaller themes and include many personal observations from a life in science,  but they say a great deal.  </P> <P> "I am suspicious of scientists who tell me that others have pinched their  ideas," Perutz writes in one of them. "Far from preventing people from stealing  it, I have always had to ram any new idea of mine down their throats. Even  scientists are unbelievably conservative."  </P> <P> Like most people, scientists prefer order to progress.  </P> <P> The one autobiographical essay in the collection is an entertaining account of  Perutz's experiences during World War II. A native of Austria, he was judged an  enemy alien by the British in 1940, though he had just gotten a Ph.D. from  Cambridge and was briefly interned and sent to Canada.  </P> <P> After his release, he was put to work on a project to make ice harder so giant  icebergs could be used as landing strips for Allied planes in the middle of the  ocean. No kidding.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Scientists Profiled  </P> <P> There are also short profiles of various scientists, including Alexander  Fleming, the discoverer of penicillin, who turns out to have been plodding and  unimaginative, leading Perutz to observe:  </P> <P> "Success in research is a haphazard business, and great discoveries are not  always made by great thinkers. Some are made by skilled craftsmen, some by  observant watchmen, and some even by prosaic people doing a regular job because  they are paid for it."  </P> <P> In the course of writing about topics and people, Perutz reveals a fair amount  about himself and what he has learned from years at the laboratory bench.  "Science offers a safe niche where you can spend a quiet life classifying  spiders, away from what E. M. Forster called the world of telegrams and anger,"  he says.  </P> <P> Not all scientists would agree with this monastic view of the scientific life,  but it is an ideal to be cherished, and it leads to a civilized view of the  world that is very much on display in this book.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Reaching the Top  </P> <P> "A discovery is like falling in love and reaching the top of a mountain after a  hard climb all in one, an ecstasy induced not by drugs but by the revelation of  a face of nature that no one has seen before," Perutz says.  </P> <P> From start to finish, Perutz makes a strong case for the orthodox view of  science, its methods and its accomplishments.  </P></p>

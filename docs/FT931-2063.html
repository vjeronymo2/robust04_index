			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Channel Hldgs expands its security side Channel Holdings, the former investment company known as Channel Tunnel Investments, is taking a further step in transforming itself into an industrial group with the acquisition of CQR, a security alarm maker, from Expamet International, for Pounds 1.72m in cash. Because of the size of the transaction CH requested a halt to dealings in the company's shares on Friday. They stood at 25p. Under the deal Channel has also agreed to procure that CQR repays Pounds 2.08m inter-company debt to Expamet. Also, on completion, CQR will repay a Pounds 647,000 loan to Expamet from its own resources. To finance the acquisition Channel proposes to raise about Pounds 4.1m by way of a placing of 8.74m new ordinary shares and a rights issue of 9.09m new ordinary, both at 23p per share. The rights will be on the basis of 3-for-5 ordinary and 3-for-1 preference shares. This acquisition follows the purchase of Carflow Products last August.</p>

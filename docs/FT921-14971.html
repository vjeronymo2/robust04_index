			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / Ashdown hardens coalition terms MR PADDY Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, yesterday toughened the conditions for his support in a hung parliament to include agreement on a four-year government programme and no income tax cuts. Mr Ashdown said opinion polls showed a balanced parliament after the general election was 'likely'. Liberal Democrats would seek a 'powerful role' in creating a stable government that implemented as many of his party's policies as possible, most crucially on electoral reform. He stood by the pledge to raise income tax if necessary to fund education reform and to increase taxes on scarce resources, including petrol. Asked if he could support a Tory government committed to cutting income tax to 20 per cent, he said: 'I wouldn't be prepared to do anything that would be bankrupting for the country or further debilitate our public services.' Senior Liberal Democrat MPs and officials decided at a final election strategy meeting that the party would try to ensure that constitutional reform was not pushed off the political agenda by Labour or the Tories. They would resist making personal attacks on Mr John Major or Mr Neil Kinnock, Labour leader - even if that meant the party was denied media attention during the election campaign. Liberal Democrat strategists argue that opinion polls are understating support for the party. Private polling, they say, shows that as many as 49 per cent of voters would support them if they thought the party had a chance of winning power. Mr Ashdown appealed to such voters, considered to be latent supporters, in his interview on BBC Radio yesterday. He said that the more people voted for the Liberal Democrats, the more their policies would be implemented. He disliked Labour and the Tories equally, he said, but in the event of a hung parliament the possible coalition partner for the Liberal Democrats would probably have been determined by the election result. 'What our aim is, is stable government and successful government for Britain over four years,' Mr Ashdown said. 'That means a government whose cornerstone is an effective majority in the House of Commons. It means a government whose reform programme includes proportional representation . . . and it means a successful programme for the government to start to implement.' He said proportional representation was the 'essential prerequisite' for stable government. Liberal Democrats would insist on the necessary legislation being implemented within the lifetime of a parliament.</p>

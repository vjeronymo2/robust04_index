			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] South Africa's new national flag has been accepted  by the Transitional Executive Council [TEC]. The flag consists  of six colors: red, green, blue, white, black, and yellow, and  is in the form of a green letter Y lying on its side. The two  short legs of the Y are on the left hand side of the flag with  the space between them colored black. The Y is surrounded by a  yellow band. The top section of the flag is red and the bottom  part blue. The ANC's [African National Congress] chief  negotiator, Mr. Cyril Ramaphosa, said the choice of a design had  been an earnest attempt to promote unity and reconciliation.  The TEC decided that the Call of South Africa and Nkosi  Sikelel' iAfrika [God Bless Africa] would both serve as national  anthems during the transitional period.</p>

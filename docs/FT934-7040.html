			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / Arts: Early Mozart The season marking Opera North's 15th year of existence continues, somewhat uncertainly, with a new production of Il re pastore (1775), the rare, slender, beautiful chamber opera - properly a dramatic serenata - of Mozart's late teenage. Measured by the company's own standards the show is a disappointing case of internal imbalance: decently played and sung (in certain instances rather more than that), feebly and trivially staged. The excuse may be that it was got up as a last-minute replacement for the Eugene Onegin which Opera North decided not to borrow from Welsh National Opera (quite wisely, in my view: that was feebleness and triviality on a much grander scale). The intended Tatyana, Joan Rodgers, and Olga, Patricia Bardon, have gone into the Re pastore cast; the remaining three members of the quintet, freshly engaged, are useful Mozartians and it is the fault of neither the singers, nor the English Northern Philharmonia under Paul Daniel, nor indeed the cleanly singable new translation by Amanda Holden, that at moments the first of the work's two acts comes close to a write-off. In his 19th year Mozart was already an international veteran of opera-composition, but he was back in Salzburg and opportunities to write operas were painfully scarce. He longed to do so, as letters attest; and when this one came his way - a piece d'occasion on an already much-set text by Metastasio, the Habsburg court poet - he seized it to produce music of a progressively deepening warmth that lifts the experience far above pastoral politeness. At its heart is the aria 'L'amero, saro costante', a reverie for the twined voices of the soprano-castrato hero and solo violin as raptly tender as anything he ever wrote. Depth and warmth the work may possess, in abundance, but it is still essentially an exercise in style - the high court style - which in any modern revival needs either careful re-creation or else stringent reassessment. Jejune coyness of the sort the Opera North director, David McVicar (also designer, in tandem with Frank Higgins), foists on the serenata structure is fatal. During the overture, puppets prance larkily on the bottom edge of the front-cloth, blocking out any possibility of actual listening to the music; the whoops-a-daisy treatment of the shepherd and shepherdess hero and heroine, attended by five cute child figurants, is in the same vein. In the second act, as weightier emotions shade the situations, the stage action becomes less footling, but by then the damage is done. At least, though, there is the ineffably delicate, fine-grained Joan Rodgers in the title role - on Thursday the pure line of her lower notes sounded a touch sullied (by a cold, I guess), but excellent technique left her mastery of Mozart style unscathed. Mary Hegarty as the shepherdess Elisa, though a less careful vocalist, beams out a ray of sunlight with her bright, sweet, unforced tones. The two tenors, Martyn Hill and Philip Salmon, cover skilfully their passing moments of dryness; Patricia Bardon's rich mezzo is too weighty for Mozart's seconda donna soprano role. Daniel's conducting tends to bustle the early stages of the work along - with this production unfolding before his eyes, who can blame him? There-after the balance between Mozartian energy and Mozartian grace is more securely held. Opera North at Grand Theatre, Leeds: in repertory until December 22; production sponsored by Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television</p>

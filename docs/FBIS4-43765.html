			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Ali Sirmen from the "The World Today" column: "The </F> Standard of Living in the Southeast"]    [Excerpts] In a statement he made after the meeting of the  State of Emergency Coordination Council which he heads, Interior  Minister Nahit Mentese said "Everything will be done to raise  the standard of living in the southeast."    It is understood from Mr. Mentese's statements that the  state  is not considering any measures for the southeast except for  investments. Unfortunately, it is impossible to say that the  approach of the state is healthy or realistic. It is true that  the Kurdish problem has an economic aspect as well, but contrary  to what certain fanatical circles claim, it is not because the  area was left deliberately backward. It is because the area is  in the periphery of Turkey, a peripheral country itself. There  is no doubt that it is necessary and useful to eliminate these  economic imbalances.    The population growth rate in this area is almost double  that  of other areas in Turkey. It is impossible for the state to end  unemployment here in the short run. It is impossible for any  state to do that, not only the Turkish republican state.    According to official figures given at the end of last year,  when the dollar was around 15,000 Turkish Lira [TL], it was  necessary to invest some TL2 billion to create one job. It is  not difficult to estimate the level of investment needed today,  when the dollar moves between TL32,000 to TL35,000.    While existing workplaces are being closed down given the  economic crisis we are in, where will the state find the  resources to invest to create job opportunities for so many  unemployed?    Granted, the state has a huge investment project in the  area.  The GAP [Southeast Anatolia Project] is one of the largest and  most ambitious projects in the world. However, GAP investments  were halted some time ago. Not even the Urfa tunnel has been  opened yet to irrigate the Harran. Another 20 to 30 years are  needed to complete this project. It seems impossible to  maintain its regular pace, let alone speed up its completion.  The cost is constantly rising.    The GAP issue was discussed at the coordination meeting and  justifiably the participants expressed the hope that efforts  will be made to complete the project. Unfortunately, these  hopes will not materialize because the state does not have the  means to go on with the project.    For years, the state has been trying to solve the problem of  unemployment in the southeast by means of emigration. Not only  does this method fail to bring a real solution to the problem,  but it changes and expands the geography of unemployment and  creates new problems.    As for the issue of encouraging the private sector to invest  in the region: Regardless of the kind of encouragement, it is  impossible to persuade any private investor to invest in the  area under the present circumstances.    Furthermore, due to the feudal structure and power relations  in the area, it is highly probable that the fruits of any  investment will be seized by the handful of sovereign elements  there. [passage omitted]    In other words, despite his goodwill, the policy announced  by  Mr. Mentese is neither realistic nor helpful.    We believe that the first steps that must be taken for the  solution of he problem are democratic measures that do not cost  economically but that will more effectively meet certain demands.</p>

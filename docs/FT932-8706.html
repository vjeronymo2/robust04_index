			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Court services switch considered MR John Taylor, spokesman in the Commons for Lord Mackay, the Lord Chancellor, confirmed yesterday that consideration was being given to switching responsibility for the provision of court services away from the public sector. He said the initial use of an agency under the so-called 'next steps' arrangements was being deliberated upon with very great care. Mr Paul Boateng, a Labour front bench spokesman, underlined the concern aroused by the 'disastrous impact of privatisation on other aspects of the justice system'. He called for an assurance that the best interests of the consumers of legal services were properly safeguarded. Mr Taylor agreed that 'it is the consumers and users whose interests must be considered the most important'.</p>

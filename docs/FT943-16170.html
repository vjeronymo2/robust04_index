			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / Race body accused of bias A complaints officer with the Commission for Racial Equality yesterday accused her employers of discrimination. Miss Ila Dhorajiwala, who is of Indian origin, said she was overlooked by the commission for a job which went to a white candidate. She was desperate to move into personnel and had told her bosses she wanted a transfer. She said she was stunned when she saw a vacancy in the commission's human resources management department advertised in a magazine. She failed to secure the job. She told an industrial tribunal in Leeds: 'I have never been given any reason why that happened. I think it is because of my race. I have seen people of other races being transferred and given jobs and I cannot understand why my transfer was not even considered.' Miss Dhorajiwala, who joined the commission in 1987, said she had not come across one coloured officer in human resources in the past four years. The solicitor for the commission said Miss Dhorajiwala tried to get her job in personnel through the back door. Mr Paul Nicholls said she did not apply for the job, but asked for a transfer from the complaints department to bypass the selection procedure. 'If you had put in an application you would have been shortlisted, but instead you put in for a transfer,' he said. The hearing was adjourned until tomorrow.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 26 KYODO -- A private panel on political  reform pressed a demand Thursday [26 May] that the next general  election be contested under a new electoral system in order to  cap years of reform efforts.    "We strongly demand that the next election for the House of  Representatives be held under the new system after quick  enactment of a bill that demarcates the boundaries of a new  electoral map," the Committee for the Promotion of Political  Reform said in a statement.    The group, made up of Japanese industry, labor and media  leaders, took a swipe at calls among the Liberal Democratic  Party and Social Democratic Party [of Japan], the two key  opposition forces, for a general poll under the current  multiseat system.    "I cannot understand at all moves to turn back the clock to  the past," Kenzo Uchida, acting chairman of the panel, said at a  news conference.    The Diet in January legislated a package of electoral reform  bills replacing the current multiseat system in the lower house  with a mix of single-seat electorates and proportional  representation.    An independent panel of experts is currently splitting up  the  nation's multiseat constituencies into 300 single-seat districts.    The private panel also called for additional efforts to  revamp the nation's political structure and carry out sweeping  administrative reform centering on deregulation and  decentralization of power.    To win back public trust in politics, the group said, the  establishment of political ethics and eradication of political  corruption are needed.</p>

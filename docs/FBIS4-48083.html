			<p>BFN     [Text] After South Africa's first black president, Nelson  Mandela, was sworn in before a host of world leaders in  Pretoria, pledges of financial aid and closer diplomatic ties  came from across the world.    The European Union says it plans to invest about 700 million  rands in South Africa to help the government fulfill the  expectations of the country's citizens. A member of the Union's  executive, Mr. Hans van den Broek, said in Pretoria that the new  government would need foreign aid for the difficult work that  lies ahead. He said people were justified in having high hopes  but that it would be a hard task satisfying them in the short  term.    Meanwhile, Canada announced the extension of General  Preferential Tariff treatment to South Africa, which makes it  easier to export to Canada. Application of the General  Preferential Tariff means that the rate of duty pay on eligible  imports from South Africa will be reduced by at least 33  percent. Australia announced that it would give an extra 17.1  million rands in aid to South Africa over the next three years.  This brings the total amount of aid to South Africa to about 90  million rands.    Promises of aid and support also came from Germany. The  German minister of foreign affairs, Dr. Klaus Kinkel, said South  Africa's new government needs international confidence and  support. He pointed out that nowhere else in Africa were the  chances for development and healthy and continuous growth so  great as in South Africa. Other nations who announced plans to  boost relations with South Africa are Indonesia, Morocco,  Bangladesh, China, India, and Singapore.</p>

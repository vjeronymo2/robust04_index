			<p><P> December 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 2 MOTHERS HELD IN BEATING OF CHILDREN TO DRIVE OUT SATAN;  </P> <P> SECTS: THE WHIPPINGS WERE CONDUCTED WITH BELTS AND TELEPHONE CORD, POLICE SAY.  OFFICIALS TOOK 10 OUT OF THEIR PARENTS' CARE.  </P> <P> Children as young as 4 were whipped with telephone cords or belts until they  screamed "Demon anger, be out of me!" as part of a small religious group's  chastisements, said police, who have arrested the mothers of several of the  children.  </P> <P> Ten children, some bruised and scarred with welts, were picked up from across  the Los Angeles area on the day after Christmas and placed with relatives or in  protective care, said Los Angeles Police Officer Victor Williams. And on  Friday, police arrested two women on suspicion of willful cruelty to children,  a felony, said Cmdr. William Booth.  </P> <P> Valerie Okongwu and Deloris Porter, both 31, were being held Saturday on  $20,000 bail each. Okongwu is the mother of four of the children, and Porter is  the mother of three, police said. They belong to "some group called Jesus  Cathedral," said Booth, a group that held its religious services in a rented  conference room at an airport motel. "They punish their kids by beating the  devil, Satan, out of them in a manner that's really too harsh."  </P> <P> "These kids were led to believe these beatings were the will of God," said  Williams, who with his partner Loretta Smith interviewed the children they  picked up and saw their scars.  </P> <P> "If they were being selfish or mischievous or angry, the parents would write  these words on a piece of paper -- 'Demon anger, be out of me!' " -- and beat  the children until they screamed what the adults had written down. "These kids  thought these beatings made them a better person."  </P> <P> The beatings were "by far the worst I've ever seen in my 10 years on the Police  Department," Williams said.  </P> <P> For nearly two weeks before Christmas, Williams said, Wilshire Division police  had gotten calls about children's crying coming from the beige stucco, boxlike  duplex, home to three or four families who other neighbors say had moved in  recently.  </P> <P> But no one would answer the door, and the complaining neighbor left no phone  number, Williams said, so police could do nothing.  </P> <P> On Dec. 26, Williams said, one of the girl's aunts "apparently saw bruises on  the girl's back and decided she had to do something about it. They knew from  talking to the kids that it stemmed from the church beatings," he said. "That's  where (the aunt) drew the line."  </P> <P> Police picked up 10 of the 11 children they knew of, all ages 4 to 14, and  "placed them in protective custody, interviewed the parents and the minister,  whoever we could talk to," Williams said. Three children were found in a house  in El Monte, he said, and one was found at the motel conference room where  services were held for what appeared to be the group's small, mostly female  membership.  </P> <P> There, Williams and his partner spoke with the minister, Chester Newvine or  Newbine, Williams could not recall which.  </P> <P> "He said he anointed the parents' hands that they may do God's work. But he  never said he anointed them specifically to beat their kids," Williams said.  "Ironically, when we were leaving, I could hear this guy preaching there was  nothing wrong with whipping your kids.  </P> <P> "The parents were wholeheartedly participating," Williams said. "They felt  their minister wouldn't steer them wrong." When one child was beaten, "all the  other kids were brought into the room and made to watch."  </P> <P> The older children were punished with telephone cords, Williams said, and the  younger ones with belts. If a child bore marks or bruises, Williams said, he  was told "that child was kept out of school until it could go back to school  with no scars."  </P> <P> On Dec. 26, one woman, a member of the religious group and mother of at least  one of the children, was arrested for outstanding traffic warrants, Williams  said. On Friday, police came back and arrested Okongwu and Porter.  </P> <P> "A couple of the kids did not believe that what was going on was right,"  Williams said. "They do not want to be returned to their parents."  </P></p>

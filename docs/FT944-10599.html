			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / European Interview: Kinnock revs up in lay-by - The European Union's next transport commissioner is eager to get motoring Mr Neil Kinnock is straining at the leash. Maybe it is the prospect of leaving behind British politics for lusher European pastures, but this week the former leader of the UK Labour party was in ebullient mood as he spoke about his new job as EU commissioner for transport. Commissioner Kinnock, who starts work in January, likes the transport portfolio. After all, ordinary European citizens can relate more readily to good, cheap, safe trans-frontier travel by air, road, rail or sea, than to the often opaque debate about the future of Europe. 'Transport is something tangible,' said Mr Kinnock in an interview, 'it can have an application literally at street level.' Over the next five years, he believes 'there is a real job for advocacy and advocates' of Europe. His warm, folksy manner will help make Europe more relevant; but ever conscious of his reputation back home as the 'Welsh windbag', he knows that 'going for the flamboyant phrase' will not be enough to win credibility. 'Before the headline term is used we need a strategy for its delivery,' he says soberly. 'Without that, this (Commission) will always look like a well appointed rest home for bureaucrats.' It is too early to pin down the new commissioner on specific policies. But he is clearly aware of the two toughest challenges in his in-tray: development of the trans-European networks (TENS), the multi-billion Ecu road, rail and other transport projects designed to link Europe's single market; and state aid cases, particularly among some of Europe's cosseted airlines, which threaten to distort that market. The TENS (like the Channel tunnel which he used to get to Brussels this week) are seen as job-creators in their own right, assuming up to Ecu400bn (Pounds 312bn) is spent over the next decade or so. But they are also the key to strengthening EU competitiveness and 'shrinking' the continent. Mr Kinnock reminds listeners that in the mid-19th century, 'single markets were created by a transport revolution' in Britain, France and Germany. 'The next 40 years will see us go through a similar process' at continental level, through a public and private partnership 'on a scale that has never been seen before'. While acknowledging the concerns of Europe's eco-lobby, he says the Greens must not be allowed to halt judiciously planned projects which will help save 'billions and billions on wasted time and fuel' on Europe's clogged highways. On state aid, the former Labour leaders seems surprisingly hawkish, even going as far as to hint that he may revisit the Commission's recent approval of FF20bn (Pounds 2.4bn) in fresh state aid for Air France, the beleaguered national carrier. 'As far as I'm concerned (Air France) is an ongoing story. No decision could reasonably have been expected to be final, could it?' he says. The Air France aid is under challenge in the European Court from a British Airways-led coalition. It is only the largest sum in a torrent of government finance to national airlines which Brussels is allowing in exchange for 'last chance' restructuring plans. Mr Kinnock believes a fine judgment has to be made between subsidies which 'are appropriate for the maintenance of vital services, or where they are giving an unfair competitive advantage'. But he insists: 'Unfair advantage has got to be taken on.' Mr Kinnock is bound to be more like the UK's senior commissioner, Sir Leon Brittan, than Mr Bruce Millan, the former Labour cabinet minister whom he is replacing. Sir Leon has repeatedly trumpeted his own and the Union's successes in competition and trade policy; by contrast, Mr Millan is almost allergic to publicity. Yet Mr Millan, a former secretary of state for Scotland, is widely credited with running a tight ship and making a success out of the EU's regional aid policy. Asked whether he will be at a disadvantage in Brussels, never having run a ministry in the UK, Mr Kinnock replies: 'I would say, modestly, yes.' But then, he smiles, 'there are not many government departments that equate to the Labour party'. So what are the main qualities a commissioner needs to do a good job? For a moment he hesitates, then reaches for Antonio Gramsci, the Italian Marxist thinker, who spoke of the need to combine 'optimism of the will, with pessimism of the intellect'. More practically, he admits that it also helps to be well connected with his Euro-Socialist confreres, who number 10 on the 21-strong Commission. Mr Kinnock is clearly delighted to be able to team up with his wife, Glenys, who preceded him into Europe and is already establishing a prominent voice as a newly elected European parliament member. He intends to make his views known across 'a fairly broad spectrum', from monetary union, through social policy, to EU expansion and reform - all issues that spark warfare among Britain's governing Conservatives. 'There will be occasions,' he says quietly, but he does not see himself primarily as a Brussels adjunct to the UK's tortured domestic debate on Europe. Advocacy, yes; but 'the soap-box is not in my baggage'.</p>

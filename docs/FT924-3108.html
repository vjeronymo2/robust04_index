			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Survey of Canada (1): Adjusting to realities - Hopes that the past few years' political and economic turbulence is over have been buoyed by early signs of business recovery and the conclusion of a North American free trade deal. But the future is not yet assured THERE are two ways of sizing up Canada as one of the more eventful years in its recent history draws to a close. One view is that this is a country whose best years have passed; a society which has grown fat and lazy, and become so preoccupied with parochial squabbling that it has lost sight of the cut-throat world beyond its borders. The other view is that Canadians have begun to sit up and take notice of the challenges facing them. They are anxious to put aside the constitutional wrangle of the past few years, and to get to grips with the economic problems which threaten their enviable standard of living. If this is true, Canada's best years could yet lie ahead. Evidence abounds to support both scenarios. On the one hand, Quebec separatists, regional forces in western Canada and other special interest groups have been emboldened by the voters' decisive rejection in a referendum last October of a constitutional deal which was supported by almost all the country's mainstream politicians. This political fragmentation could be reinforced in the next general election, which is likely to be called for the late summer or early autumn of 1993. A strong showing by the separatist Bloc Quebecois and by the western-based Reform Party would deprive either of the two main parties, the Progressive Conservatives (who have been in office for the past eight years) or the Liberals, of a clear mandate. A minority government would probably be distracted from urgent economic and social issues by the political juggling needed to stay in office. On the economic front, the world is no longer beating a path to Canada's door for raw materials. British Columbia's spruce and cedar forests may still be among the finest in the world, but buyers can find trees which grow much faster elsewhere these days, and are cut and processed by cheap, non-union labour. Tough environmental laws and other forms of bureaucratic red tape have made Canada less attractive to mining companies than it used to be. The rich cod stocks on the Grand Banks of Newfoundland have all but disappeared. The productivity of Canadian workers has grown more slowly than in any other OECD country over the past decade. One in three pupils drops out of school, and there is widespread dissatisfaction with the quality of education and worker training. To make matters worse, a decade of free-spending federal and provincial governments has left the public sector burdened by towering budget deficits and debilitating debt-service payments. The federal government, which keeps promising fiscal restraint, ended up with its second-biggest deficit ever in the year to March 1992. But any effort to restore fiscal discipline must contend with growing public resistance to an already-heavy tax burden. At the same time, Canadians show little inclination to sacrifice the social security net and the panoply of services which make Canadians' lives so comfortable. Despite this long list of problems, the picture of Canada at the end of 1992 is not entirely gloomy. The very fact that six out of 10 provinces voted No to the Charlottetown constitutional deal (and a seventh, Ontario, which is the most powerful province, was almost evenly split), has raised hopes that the country may not be about to fall apart. The bruising referendum campaign has left remarkably few scars. Most Canadians seem simply relieved that the divisive and arcane debate about the constitution has disappeared for the time being from the evening news. Most crucially, the No side's victory may not have given the Quebec separatists as much of a boost as most political commentators predicted. Recent opinion polls show that support for independence is flagging in the francophone province. There is no question of Quebeckers feeling betrayed by English-speaking Canada's rejection of the constitutional deal, as was the case when Manitoba and Newfoundland scuttled the Meech Lake accord in 1990. While Quebeckers made the Meech Lake agreement a litmus test of their acceptance by English Canada, some 56 per cent of them voted against the latest set of reforms. The referendum result also does not appear to have done lasting political damage to Mr Robert Bourassa, Quebec's crafty premier. Mr Bourassa, often accused in the past of taking an ambivalent stand on sovereignty, came out unequivocally during the referendum campaign as a champion of a united Canada. Meanwhile, two recent economic developments are forcing Canadian managers and workers to adjust to the realities of global competition. The first is the ultra-tight monetary policy followed by the Bank of Canada between 1988 and 1991. Soaring interest rates and a climbing Canadian dollar pushed the economy into an unexpectedly severe recession. That has brought inflation down to an annual rate of slightly over 1 per cent, the lowest among the G7 nations. It has also squeezed the pips of Canadian business, especially manufacturing. One example: Dofasco and Stelco, the two biggest steelmakers, have piled up combined losses of CDollars 1.3bn since 1990. The second jolt has come from the US-Canada free trade agreement, now nearing its fourth anniversary. The provisions of the FTA are relatively modest in terms of lowering trade barriers. They centre on eliminating customs duties between the two countries by 1998 (most of which were already low) and guaranteeing US access to Canadian energy resources. But coinciding with the unexpectedly severe recession, the FTA has given Canadian industry a shrill wake-up call. One company after another is freezing or rolling back wages, combining two or more small high-cost plants into a single efficient one, and searching for ways to reverse the long slide in worker productivity. Mr John Crow, governor of the Bank of Canada, summed up the pluses and minuses of the economic shocks in a recent speech: 'While in the short run, restructuring can act as a drag on demand, the future benefits of doing things smarter are enormous.' With the divisive referendum over and early signs of a business recovery now starting to appear, the big question is which of the above, radically different views of Canada's future will turn out to be closer to the mark. Judging by their recent performance, financial markets lean towards pessimism. Pressure on the Canadian dollar has been intense since early September. Despite constant intervention by the Bank of Canada and a steep rise in short-term interest rates, the currency tumbled from almost 83 US cents to less than 78 cents in less than three months. Standard and Poor's recently lowered its Triple-A credit rating on federal government agencies. Moreover, Ontario's bond rating has been cut twice in the past two years. Canadian pension funds and other institutions are putting a growing proportion of their funds either into foreign markets or into Canadian companies, such as Seagram and Northern Telecom, with large foreign operations. Next year's federal election could prove pivotal in assessing Canada's long-term prospects. The outcome at this stage is wide open. The popularity of the Conservative government remains at rock-bottom. It is paying the price for presiding over the difficult times of the past few years and for Canadians' intense dislike of Mr Brian Mulroney, the prime minister. Mr Mulroney remains confident however, that he can bounce back during 1993 as the economy starts to pick up, and Canadians appreciate the long-term wisdom of his party's policies. The Tories have already indicated that, if re-elected, they plan to tackle some thorny issues, including the generous but costly unemployment insurance and social security systems. The opposition Liberals are at this stage an unknown quantity. The party is still in the throes of putting together an election platform, pitting a group of business-oriented young Turks against a more interventionist old guard. In the two years since he was elected Liberal leader, Mr Jean Chretien has failed to galvanise the party. But a drive to put up some high-powered candidates for the next election and a flurry of organising at the grassroots are signs that the Liberals are desperately hungry to return to office after eight fractious years in the political wilderness. The Liberals stand to gain more than the Conservatives from the emergence of the Alberta-based Reform Party and the Bloc Quebecois. Both regional groups have drawn the bulk of their support from former Tory voters. Mr Preston Manning, the Reform Party's folksy leader, and the more fiery Mr Lucien Bouchard, who heads the BQ, have both succeeded in attracting strong support on their home turf. As opinion polls now stand, these two parties plus the social-democratic New Democrats could garner enough seats between them to deprive either the Conservatives or Liberals of a majority government. Political observers talk darkly of the next election producing an unstable 'Italian-style' parliament. It would be a mistake, however, to cast this prediction in stone. As the referendum result showed, Canadian politics is in a fluid and unpredictable state. The one certainty is that the picture of Canada's future will be much clearer by this time next year.</p>

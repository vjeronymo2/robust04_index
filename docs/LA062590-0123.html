			<p><P> June 25, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> 38-WIN STREAK ENDS FOR MAPPLE  </P> <P> A woman considered the best female jumper in water skiing history ended her  38-tournament winning streak Sunday.  </P> <P> Deena Mapple, who holds the world record of 156 feet, was bothered by gusty  conditions and jumped just 126 feet.  </P> <P> The effort gave her third place in the Dallas Grand Prix of Waterskiing.  </P> <P> Mapple, 30, of Orlando, Fla., had not lost a competition in nearly three years.  </P> <P> Sherri Slone won with a jump of 131 feet and Camille Duvall finished second at  129 feet.  </P> <P> "I'm pretty disappointed," Mapple said. "I would have liked the streak to end  with me jumping well and somebody jumping better than me. But I'm kind of  relieved. For three years, I've been wondering if this is the one that I lose."  </P> <P> Mapple's husband, Andy, won the men's slalom competition in Dallas on Sunday.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Richard Norton-Taylor, Ian Black, and Kathy </F> Evans: "Contacts May Have Been Initiated by Radical Factions"]    [Text] The relationship between the Irish republican  movement and Iran began 13 years ago with the death of the IRA  hunger striker Bobby Sands.    To the irritation of British diplomats, the Tehran street on  which the depleted British embassy stands has been named Bobby  Sands Avenue.    A year after he died, a Sinn Fein delegation attended a  "Conference of World Movements" in the Iranian capital. Iran  repaid that compliment by sending observers to Sinn Fein's  annual conference in the early 1980s. Two members of Sinn Fein  visited the Iranian-backed Hezbollah organisation in Beirut in  1987 in an attempt to secure the release of Irish hostage Brian  Keenan. The same year, Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president,  visited Tehran.    British intelligence has been trying ever since to find out  whether those open contacts -- more at the level of political  solidarity than anything else -- would lead to more threatening  covert links.    This is the backdrop described yesterday by Whitehall  sources  after the Foreign Office announced that the Iranian charge  d'affaires, Gholamreza Ansari, had been summoned for a  ticking-off after intelligence reports of meetings between the  IRA and Iranian intelligence officials in West Europe.    Despite the perceived threat from Iran, there is no evidence  that it has supplied the IRA with weapons or funds. Yesterday's  initiative was pre-emptive. "At this stage specific alarm bells  began to ring and they're still ringing," one official said,  "and now the Iranians can hear them."    According to British officials, the man in charge of links  with the IRA is Amirhossein Taghavi, head of the Western  European Section of Iran's Ministry for Intelligence Services.  MOIS, as it is known by Western spy agencies, is the body  responsible for contacts with subversive or terrorist  organisations abroad, and is headed by a cleric, 'Ali Fallahian.    Taghavi is also said to have co-ordinated ties with  organisations such as Abu Nidal, Lebanon's Hizballah and the  Greek November 17th movement.    Some Iran-watchers doubted yesterday whether contacts with  the IRA would have been initiated by the hard-pressed government  of President Hashemi Rafsanjani and argued that it was more  likely that radical factions outside the government were  involved.    Other experts pointed out that Iran's record on subversion  and terrorism has been improving recently, a fact attributed to  the country's need to reschedule its debts with foreign,  especially European, creditors.    Britain takes the Iranian threat seriously, although it sees  a need to balance fears about terrorism with concern for trade  and broader relations. Diplomatic ties, severed in 1989, were  restored in 1990 and there are 14 British diplomats in Iran,  serving under a charge d'affaires.    The long-standing threat to kill Salman Rushdie, author of  The Satanic Verses -- repeated recently -- is seen as evidence  of Tehran's intentions. And there was fury in London when Ali  Fallahian, the MOIS chief was invited for official talks in Bonn  last year.    In the past Iranian intelligence organisations have become a  battleground in the fight between reformist and radical factions  which has plagued the Islamic regime virtually since its  inception in 1979. Ordinary Iranians live in fear of these  bodies, which have been behind the arrest and execution  thousands of people and the regular campaigns on Islamic dress  which have led to the detention of hundreds of women.    Western intelligence sources have also focused on the  activities of the Pasdaran or Revolutionary Guards, the  ideological army of the republic.    In the last year or more, the radicals are said to have lost  a lot of support as most Iranians became preoccupied with the  economic crisis.    But the latest move comes at a time when the IRA's financial  resources are under increasing pressure from security and  intelligence agencies in the UK and the United States and when  it is seeking more sophisticated arms, including specialist  sniper rifles and anti-helicopter missiles.    A spate of armed robberies the early 1990s offered a clue  that the IRA -- which is estimated to spend 5 million pounds to  7 million a year -- needed funds. Contributions from US  sympathisers have been falling and are estimated to amount to  less than 100,000 pounds a year. Law enforcement agencies have  turned their attention sources of funds including drinking  clubs, cross-border smuggling and fraud. This month, police in  Britain and both sides of the Irish border launched operation  Madronna, seizing cash stolen property and financial documents.  The operation was symptomatic of a squeeze on paramilitary  funding by the Royal Ulster Constabulary's C13 unit.    Where weapons are concerned, the IRA still holds huge  arsenal  provided by Libya in the mid-1980s, hidden underground bunkers  across the Irish Republic.    At the end of 1992 it was estimated that the Provisional,  north and south of the border still had 650 Kalashnikov AK type  semi-automatic rifles more than a dozen general purpose  machine-guns; about 20 DSHK Russian heavy-calibre  armour-piercing machine-guns; one SAM-7 surface-to-air missile  (nine others have been recovered); more than 40 RPG rocket  launchers six flame throwers; 70 Webley revolvers; more than 600  detonators, a three tons of Semtex explosive -- half the Libyan  arms ship six years earlier.    Security sources believe this could sustain the armed  conflict for years.</p>

Over to TV reporter Souria Bouamama for more  details on the visit:    [Bouamama] In traditional Arab decor, Colonel Mu'ammar  al-Qadhdhafi, leader of the Libyan revolution, yesterday  received Mohamed Salah Dembri, who handed him a letter of  friendship and esteem from Liamine Zeroual to the leadership and  people of Libya. During this meeting, al-Qadhdhafi renewed his  satisfaction with Zeroual's appointment as president of state  and wished him success.    On the purpose of this visit, Salah Dembri had this to say:    [Begin Dembri recording] This visit follows the recent visit  which brother al-Khuwaylidi al-Humaydi paid to Algeria. During  this visit we discussed ways to strengthen and bolster our  bilateral relations. We also talked about all the issues of  common interest, including matters concerning the situation in  the Arab homeland, particularly the current situation in the  Maghreb. We also talked about everything which concerns us in  our natural environment, namely the African environment and our  Mediterranean environment. [end recording]    [Bouamama] On this visit, Mr. Jam'a al-Fazzani, general  secretary of the People's Committee for Unity, had this to say:    [Begin recording] [al-Fazzani] This visit is aimed at  starting a new phase which is more advanced and clearer in the  establishment of Libyan Arab-Algerian relations, which are based  on a number of factors. These include the ties and bonds  linking the two fraternal peoples, and also the principles on  which the 1 November Revolution and the 1 September Revolution  are based. These principles bring us closer together and do not  separate us.    [Bouamama] Now that we are flying in Libyan airspace,  despite  the embargo imposed on Libya, how is Libya living now under the  embargo?    [al-Fazzani] I am glad you have asked this question. The  Libyan Arab people are standing fast in the face of the blockade  because they are aware of the extent of the conspiracy being  hatched against them. [end recording]</p>

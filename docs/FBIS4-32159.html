			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague June 18 (CTK) -- The Democratic Union (DEU)  will seek enactment of the non-proscription of the crimes of  communism, says a manifesto of the new right-wing party which  was officially constituted today. The manifesto also calls for  barring former higher Communist Party officials, agents of the  secret police (StB) and members of extremist parties and  movements from civil service. It stresses that "the tyranny of  the StB minority nomenklatura" had been continuing because no  essential attempt had been made to settle accounts with the  totalitarian past.    Espousing fundamental liberal democratic values, the DEU  will  assert a new concept of politics as an activity which is not  "dirty," but which will restore people's civic self-confidence  and interest in commitment in public affairs, the manifesto says.    DEU was registered as a political party at the beginning of  March. The idea to establish a new right-orientated party  appeared for the first time last September in an article signed  by Josef Kudlacek, publisher of the right-orientated daily CESKY  DENIK. In it he criticised the policy of the strongest Czech  party, the Civic Democratic Party (ODS) of Premier Vaclav Klaus.    Kudlacek then wrote that the creation of the new party was  "an opportunity for this country, an opportunity to prevent the  left from seizing power again in the next elections." He also  said that "unless a new right-orientated party is established,  our country will be faced with the tragic Polish turnabout."    The party today elected Alena Hromadkova its chairwoman.  Hromadkova, 51, is a sociologist and economist by education.  She had never been a member of any party. She signed the  Charta 77 human rights manifesto. She was one of its  spokeswomen in 1991.</p>

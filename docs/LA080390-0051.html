			<p><P> August 3, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> 5 ARE FINALISTS TO HEAD COMPTON SCHOOLS  </P> <P> The list of candidates for superintendent of schools has been narrowed to five  who will be interviewed by the Board of Education on Aug. 11, according to the  consultant hired to help find a new schools chief.  </P> <P> Latino leaders in Compton want the board, which has six black members and one  Latino member, to make acting Supt. Elisa L. Sanchez superintendent. This year,  Latino children are more than half of the district's approximately 26,000  students.  </P> <P> Wilson Riles, former state superintendent of public instruction and now the  head of his own Sacramento search firm, declined to reveal the names of the  finalists for the top job in the Compton Unified School District.  </P> <P> About 40 educators, Riles said, applied for the Compton job, which became  vacant in January when Supt. Ted D. Kimbrough left to become head of the  Chicago public school system. Sanchez joined the district in 1983 as an  assistant superintendent of educational services and later became deputy  superintendent until the board named her acting superintendent.  </P> <P> Riles said he believes the choice will be made by the opening of school Sept.  11.  </P> <P> Whoever gets the job faces a multitude of critical problems. For years, Compton  student test scores have been among the lowest in the state; the dropout rate  is among the highest. School buildings are badly deteriorated.  </P> <P> Labor relations have been poor for years, too. Teachers, among the lowest paid  in Los Angeles County, have been working for two years without a contract  because their union and the school board cannot agree on salaries. In addition,  the district had to make deep cuts in its budget this year to balance it.  </P> <P> Starting pay for teachers in Compton is $23,226, compared to about $27,000 in  the Los Angeles Unified School District. According to a report issued in April  by a state researcher helping to negotiate a teacher contract in Compton, the  maximum salary for teachers is $37,575, while the average highest salary for  the top 10 districts in Los Angeles County is $44,569.  </P> <P> Riles said he and his staff met with parents to find out what sort of  superintendent they want.  </P> <P> "They are very concerned about the achievement level of their kids," he said.  "When they look at the test scores that are published, their kids are always  low on the scale and they want that turned around. They want to be sure that  the money the district gets is efficiently spent and not wasted."  </P></p>

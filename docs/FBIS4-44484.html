			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by staff reporter Feng Zhaoying (7458 0340 5391) </F> Deputy Chief, Heilongjiang Provincial Department of Water  Conservancy: "World Water Day"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted]    [Reporter] At the present time, what kind of water resource  problems still exist in Heilongjiang Province? How will they  affect our province's development?    [Feng] There are four kinds of problems facing water  resources in our province. First is the relatively low volume of  water resources. Second is the imbalance in the time and space  distribution of these water resources. Third is serious  pollution affecting water quality. Finally, is the low capacity  available to exert control of water resources on a broader scale.    For many years, the average annual precipitation has  measured 531.4 mm, 18 percent lower than the national average,  and placing Heilongjiang 25th among 30 provinces, cities and  regions. The total volume of water resources in Heilongjiang is  77.2 billion cubic meters, which translates into 2,180 cubic  meters per capita, 520 cub meters lower than the per capita  amount nationally. The acreage share of water per mu is only  one-third of that per mu nationwide. Rainfall and runoff during  the year are concentrated in the months June through September,  comprising 60 percent to 80 percent of the annual precipitation,  which leads to easy flooding. Since rainfall during June is less  than 10 percent of the annual total, a spring drought frequently  occurs. Water distribution is concentrated mostly in hilly  areas, which is 74.5 percent of the total precipitation. While  only 25.5 percent of the water resources is located in the  plains where 80 percent of the cultivated land in the province  is found, one can see how the arrangement between water and land  resources is extremely illogical. The quality of natural water  in Heilongjiang is very good, except it is seriously polluted by  humans. Rivers where the pollution is more serious include the  Sunghuajiang, Mudanjiang, Tangwanghe, Musuhe, Ashihe, Anbanghe  etc. It is now possible to regulate and control surface runoff  in Heilongjiang at 7 billion cubic meters. In comparison with  Jilin and Liaoning Provinces, this scale of control is far lower  than theirs. Moreover, Heilongjiang's effort is a preliminary  development phase, which depends chiefly on natural runoff.  These problems seriously inhibit Heilongjiang's economy and the  improvement in living conditions of its inhabitants.    [Reporter] What measures and practices has Heilongjiang  adopted to strengthen the management of these water resources?    [Feng] Heilongjiang places great importance on management of  the province's water resources. In 1988, after the "PRC Water  Law" had been promulgated, Heilongjiang's People's Provincial  Assembly passed "Implementation of the `PRC Water Law,'" and the  provincial CPC committee and provincial government issued  "Identification of Several Problems on Strengthening Water  Conservation Construction Projects." Following this, the  provincial government further established a means to implement  this "identification." The appearance of a series of regulations  and policy statements issued by the provincial CPC, the  provincial assembly, and the provincial government on following  the law regarding water control and flood prevention,  comprehensive management of water resources, mobilizing all  elements in society to participate in water conservation, to  strengthen water conservation-based industries and turn around  the passive economic development that had resulted from sluggish  buildup of irrigation and water conservancy projects.    To logically open up and effectively protect the water  resources in Heilongjiang, we must start with basic tasks by  initiating an overall survey and evaluation of the whole  province's water resources. We must classify water resources by  river basin and cities/towns; investigate and evaluate  underground water resources for those towns suffering water  shortages; and make a present status survey of water resources  being tapped and used. Based on the needs of the "Water Law,"  Heilongjiang will organize water administrative teams overseeing  water use compliance, and their authority will extend all the  way down to the village level to locate and deal with cases  flouting the water conservation law. Supported by the court in  some localities, special water conservation courts may be set up.    To strengthen the unified management of water resources, we  must implement a plan for economic use of water. Within the  province, the plan must cover tapping of water directly from  rivers, lakes, and underground sources, implementing a permit  system for water extraction where "water extraction permits" are  issued by water administration agencies at various levels, and  collecting a water resource fee.    [Reporter] What engineering projects will the province  consider in the next step?    [Feng] For several years Heilongjiang has invested  considerable sums to build several irrigation and water  conservation projects. Among them are 69 large and small-size  reservoirs controlling a total volume of 7 billion meters of  water. Add to this the engineering project diverting water from  the Nunjiang, and a series of water conservation items in the  Sanjiang area--all of which are having an impact on development  in Heilongjiang. However, these already-built projects cannot  meet present needs. In accordance with the spirit of  "Identifying Several Problems on Strengthening Water  Conservation Construction Projects," issued by the provincial  CPC and the provincial government, new construction and  expansion, and safety maintenance will involve 14 large and  mid-size reservoirs, which will increase the capacity to control  surface water to more than 10 billion cubic meters. The  importance of the Nierji, Qinglongshan, and other reservoirs in  the planning stage right now is to increase the capacity to  control the water volume in some of the important rivers in the  province to meet the needs of agricultural production along both  river shorelines, and thereby stimulate economic development in  these areas.</p>

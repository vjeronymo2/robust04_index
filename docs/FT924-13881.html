			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / International Company News: Lufthansa in talks to sell part of stake in luxury hotel chain LUFTHANSA, the German airline, said yesterday it was negotiating to sell part of its 42.6 per cent stake in the Kempinski luxury hotel chain. The negotiations follow Lufthansa's announcement last June that it was scaling down plans to merge Kempinski with Air France's Meridien chain. Lufthansa said it was in talks with several interested parties, but the most likely buyer of the Kempinski stake is thought to be Advanta Management, a German investment group controlled by Mr Hans Dieter Bock. Der Spiegel, the German news magazine, reported recently that Lufthansa would retain an interest in the chain of about 10 per cent. It is believed, however, that Lufthansa would like to keep its stake in the chain at above 10 per cent. The plan to merge the Kempinski and Meridien chains was announced last April. It would have created an 80-hotel group with 25,000 employees and annual sales of Dollars 1bn. Air France would have been the majority shareholder in the merged company. The hotels would have retained their own names. Meridien has 60 hotels worldwide. Kempinski is strongest in Germany, but with a growing presence in North America and Asia. In June, however, Lufthansa said it regarded the merger as a long-term objective only. In the interim, it said, co-operation between the two hotel groups would be limited to a joint marketing arrangement. Lufthansa said if the marketing arrangement was successful, a mutual holding company would be created. It said that no further decision would be taken without the consent of Lufthansa, thereby ensuring that the interests of the Kempinski chain would be assured. The scaling-down of the merger plan led to speculation that the Kempinski management had opposed the deal. Lufthansa was also said to be concerned that a merger could threaten standards at the Kempinski hotels. The German airline said that any arrangement would have to ensure that quality of the Kempinski hotels was upheld. Lufthansa said it could not comment on the future of its relationship with Air France while the current negotiations were in progress.</p>

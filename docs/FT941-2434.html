			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / Observer: Mind numbering Clearly lucky numbers are big business in that part of the world. A licence plate bearing the number 9 was bought by businessman Yeung Sau-shing for a record HKDollars 13m (USDollars 1.6m) at a Hong Kong government auction on Saturday. Certain licence plates are hot properties because some digits, when spoken in Cantonese, sound like desirable words. 'Nine' sounds like the word for 'dog' and is considered lucky because 1994 is the year of the dog in the Chinese lunar calendar.</p>

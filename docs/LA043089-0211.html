			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> CHAINS PLEDGE TO INVESTIGATE;  </P> <P> ALAR FOUND ON O.C. APPLES IN STORES DISCLAIMING USE  </P> <P> Red apples purchased from four of five Orange County supermarkets were found in  independent tests to have residue of Alar, a possibly carcinogenic chemical  that each of the stores claimed was not used by their apple suppliers.  </P> <P> The tests, conducted for The Times Orange County by a private San Francisco  laboratory, found the highest levels of Alar -- 4.59 parts per million -- in a  sample of McIntosh apples from Albertson's in Cypress, where signs had been  prominently displayed claiming that all apples were Alar-free.  </P> <P> Upon hearing of the test results, the store's manager said he planned to "pull  them (the McIntosh apples) off the racks right now."  </P> <P> All levels of Alar residue detected in the tests of apples bought in Orange  County were significantly lower than the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's  allowable limit of 20 p.p.m. But that limit -- set before the chemical was  linked to cancer in animals -- could cause health problems over the long run,  though not in the short run, an EPA spokesman said, adding that no detectable  level of Alar is without risk. The EPA is expected to ban the chemical next  year.  </P> <P> Apples with Alar residue also were found at Irvine Ranch Farmers Market in  Irvine, an upscale market specializing in gourmet food, as well as at Vons  Pavilions in Buena Park and Alpha Beta in San Clemente. All claimed either in  signs or in response to questions before the testing that the apples were free  of the controversial chemical.  </P> <P> In all, only six of 25 samples of red apples purchased from April 18 through 20  at five Orange County stores showed Alar residue. The markets were chosen  randomly for a geographic sampling from Buena Park to San Clemente.  </P> <P> Spokesmen for the store chains expressed surprised at the test results, saying  they had been assured by their suppliers that the apples were not Alar-tainted,  and all pledged to investigate.  </P> <P> A representative of one of the growers that supplied apples with Alar residue  to two stores angrily refused to comment.  </P> <P> Alar -- the trade name for the chemical daminozide, which is used on some apple  crops to extend shelf life -- has been linked to cancer. Consumer advocates  contend that children are particularly at risk because they eat  disproportionately large amounts of apples, apple juice and applesauce.  </P> <P> Of the five stores selected by The Times to have their apples tested, only  Mother's Market in Costa Mesa -- a large health food store with a smaller  branch in Huntington Beach -- had red apples that showed no detectable traces  of Alar.  </P> <P> The independent tests call into question the EPA's estimates that Alar is used  on only 5% to 10% of the nation's apple crop and dramatize the need for an  immediate ban on the chemical, according to a scientist with an environmental  group that released a controversial study earlier this year.  </P> <P> And even the lowest level detected in the tests, 0.97 p.p.m., is high enough to  indicate that the chemical was used during the crop's growth and is not a  residual trace left over from the spraying of previous crops, agreed spokesmen  for the EPA and the Natural Resources Defense Council, the environmental group  that released the study earlier this year about the chemical's effect on  children. Tests have shown that most apples from crops sprayed with Alar have  levels of 1 to 5 p.p.m., consistent with the findings in the tests done for The  Times, according to a senior scientist with NRDC.  </P> <P> Earlier testing for The Times at Los Angeles-area stores found Alar ranging  from 0.59 p.p.m. to 9.48 p.p.m. in apples purchased at four upscale markets --  Mrs. Gooch's Natural Foods Market in Beverly Hills, Gelson's Markets in Century  City, Bristol Farms in South Pasadena, and Farmers Market in Los Angeles. Tests  on apples bought at two major supermarket chains, a Hughes market in Monterey  Park and a Lucky store in Bell, had residues ranging from 0.97 p.p.m. to 9  p.p.m.  </P> <P> In the latest tests, Albertson's officials said they were surprised by the  results showing Alar residue in McIntosh apples. The grocery chain has had a  policy since August, 1986, to not purchase apples treated with Alar, a policy  that the suppliers are aware of, said Steve Hilton, manager of quality  assurance at the supermarket chain's headquarters in Boise, Ida. "The supplier  of that product is, I think, going to read this news with chagrin. . . . We  will certainly be in touch with him."  </P> <P> He said Albertson's periodically requests and receives test reports on some  shipments, "although we don't do it on all shipments."  </P> <P> Three other types of red apples purchased at the Orange County store -- small  and large Red Delicious and Rome Beauty -- showed no detectable levels in The  Times' tests.  </P> <P> At the Los Angeles headquarters of Irvine Ranch Farmers Market, general manager  Doug Sweeney said he was surprised and disappointed to learn that two of the  six types of red apples sold at the chain's store at 14443 Culver Drive,  Irvine, had traces of Alar. The tests found 3.93 p.p.m. in Cortland apples and  1.2 p.p.m. in small Red Delicious apples, while Gala, Rome Beauty, large Red  Delicious and McIntosh apples showed no detectable traces in the tests. The  supplier had assured him that all apples were free of the chemical, he said.  </P> <P> "The wholesaler in Los Angeles that we buy from gave us a letter saying his  packer, shipper and growers do not use Alar," Sweeney said.  </P> <P> Irvine Ranch Farmers Markets used to contract with a laboratory to test apples  but had to stop after the store sought protection under bankruptcy laws last  July 22. "The expense is such that under bankruptcy conditions, we couldn't  afford it anymore," he said.  </P> <P> Sweeney said last week that his supplier, when informed of the test results,  indicated that he can produce letters from growers stating they do not use  Alar.  </P> <P> "We don't deal directly with the growers so until (the supplier) further  investigates, we won't know what is going on," Sweeney said. "The supplier will  have to pinpoint from what source he purchased the apples. The Cortland apple  comes out of New York, and they are gone for the year, so we may not get  results back. But with the Washington Red Delicious, we ought to find out why  they contained Alar."  </P> <P> At two other stores, Alpha Beta and Vons Pavilions, Alar-tainted apples came in  prepackaged bags from the Evans Fruit Co. in Yakima, Wash.  </P> <P> Officials of Evans Fruit were asked to comment on the finding of Alar, but a  woman who identified herself only as the co-owner of the company hung up during  a telephone call. Before doing so, the woman said angrily: "Do you consider  yourself the watchdog of the community? Well, you just go ahead and do what you  do, and what we do is immaterial."  </P> <P> Apples from a 3-pound bag of Evans Fruit Co.'s "Washington State" brand Red  Delicious apples, purchased at Alpha Beta in San Clemente, showed 2.73 p.p.m.,  the testing laboratory reported. Unpackaged small Red Delicious apples from the  same Alpha Beta also tested positive, at 0.97 p.p.m.  </P> <P> Bill Wade, a spokesman for the Alpha Beta Co. headquarters in La Habra, said  the grocery chain's policy is to sell only apples from non-Alar-treated  orchards.  </P> <P> "We've instructed all our growers not to use Alar on products sent to us," Wade  said. "We're very clear about that. The state Food and Agriculture Department  does the testing (on Alpha Beta apples and other produce), and we accept their  testing.  </P> <P> "But a residual amount (of Alar) can remain on trees from previous years of  use, and it can show up in low levels. Nonetheless, we want apples free of  Alar, and we'll be checking on this situation."  </P> <P> But the NRDC scientist disagreed, saying such levels do indicate that Alar was  used on the current crop.  </P> <P> A spokeswoman for Vons Pavilions -- the source of the second 3-pound  prepackaged bag of Evans' Fruit "Washington State" apples, this one with 1.08  p.p.m. of Alar -- said the grocery chain will investigate the grower's apples.  </P> <P> The sign over the apple bins at the chain's Buena Park store, where the bag was  bought, had this sign: "We only buy apples that HAVE NOT been grown with the  chemical Daminozide, better known as Alar."  </P> <P> Vickie Sanders, a spokeswoman for Vons Cos. Inc. at its El Monte headquarters,  said the chain has random tests performed by the state Food and Agriculture  Department, in addition to performing its own "quality assurance" checks.  </P> <P> "It's impossible to test every apple," Sanders said. "But in cases like this,  as soon as we learn of any traces of Alar, we pull all those apples, because  we're taking every effort to safeguard the consumer's health.  </P> <P> "We will take steps to visit with that company (Evans Fruit) and see that this  does not happen again, but this does not mean that Evans' apples are unsafe to  eat."  </P> <P> At Mother's Market in Costa Mesa, manager Sharon Macgurn said the store  occasionally asks an employee of the state Food and Agriculture Department who  lives in the area to test fruit.  </P> <P> "We feel pretty confident, and we're glad you've confirmed it," said Steve  Markell, the store's nutritional biochemist.  </P> <P> Mother's Market sold six varieties of red apples last week, but only the  organic apples -- which must be certified to have been grown in a field where  no fertilizers, pesticides, growth regulators or any other chemicals have been  used for a year -- had signs attesting to their purity.  </P> <P> Lawrie Mott, senior scientist with the NRDC, said the tests done for The Times  demonstrate the need for swift EPA action to remove the "non-essential  chemical" from the market. "Retailers are in a difficult position. They have to  accept suppliers' claims, or they have to pay for their own expensive testing,"  she said.  </P> <P> There is no known "safe level," Mott said.  </P> <P> "Any level of exposure carries some risk. The higher the exposure, the higher  the risk," Mott asserted. "I think it's a chemical we need to have taken off  the market as soon as possible."  </P> <P> EPA spokesman Albert Heier agreed that there is no "safe level" for Alar.  "Whenever you have a pesticide that is a carcinogen, we don't talk about a safe  level," he said.  </P> <P> Heier said the level of 20 p.p.m. was set for field testing of apples. Alar  breaks down quickly after the apples leave the field, and as it dissipates, the  risk to humans lessens too, he said.  </P> <P> He said the fact that more than one-fifth of the apples in tests conducted for  The Times were Alar-positive does not indicate that the EPA estimates of Alar  treatment are wrong.  </P> <P> The apples for sale in markets now have been stored for many months, so it is  possible that a higher percentage of them have been treated, because Alar  lengthens shelf life, he said.  </P> <P> The Times' tests were performed by Anresco Inc., a San Francisco laboratory.  Each sample consisted of eight to 10 apples and was plainly packaged and coded  so that the laboratory did not know the variety of apple or its source. The PAM  II method -- the official test method for daminozide -- was used. It can detect  levels of Alar from 0.5 p.p.m. and above.  </P> <P> Times staff writers Bill Billiter and Carla Rivera contributed to this story.  </P> <P> </P> <P> ALAR LEVELS IN ORANGE COUNTY APPLES  </P> <P> Twenty-five samples of red apples were purchased from five Orange County  supermarkets from April 18 through 20 and tested for the presence of Alar.  Alar, the trade name of daminozide, has been linked to cancer in animals. Each  store had indicated it was selling Alar-free apples. Each sample contained  seven to 10 apples. Six of the samples tested by a private lab indicated levels  ranging from 0.97 to 4.59 parts per million. The U.S. Environmental Protection  Agency has set an allowable limit of 20 p.p.m., although a spokesman said no  level is without risk.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Mother's Market and Kitchen,225 E. 17th St., Costa Mesa.  </P> <P> "Organic Red Delicious" no detectable level  </P> <P> Red Delicious, small no detectable level  </P> <P> Red Delicious, large no detectable level  </P> <P> Gala, from New Zealand no detectable level  </P> <P> McIntosh no detectable level  </P> <P> Rome Beauty no detectable level  </P> <P> </P> <P> Alpha Beta,500 Camino de Estrella, San Clemente.  </P> <P> * 3-pound prepackaged bag of Red Delicious 2.73 p.p.m.  </P> <P> * Red Delicious, small 0.97 p.p.m.  </P> <P> Red Delicious, large no detectable level  </P> <P> McIntosh no detectable level  </P> <P> </P> <P> Irvine Ranch Farmers Market,14443 Culver Drive, Irvine.  </P> <P> * Red Delicious, small 1.2 p.p.m.  </P> <P> *Cortland 3.93 p.p.m.  </P> <P> 5-pound prepackaged bag of Red Delicious no detectable level  </P> <P> McIntosh no detectable level  </P> <P> Gala, from New Zealand no detectable level  </P> <P> Red Delicious, large no detectable level  </P> <P> Rome Beauty no detectable level  </P> <P> </P> <P> Albertson's,10051 Valley View St., Cypress.  </P> <P> * McIntosh 4.59 p.p.m.  </P> <P> Rome Beauty no detectable level  </P> <P> Red Delicious, small no detectable level  </P> <P> Red Delicious, large no detectable level  </P> <P> </P> <P> Vons Pavilion,8351 La Palma Ave., Buena Park.  </P> <P> * 3-pound prepackaged bag of Red Delicious 1.08 p.p.m.  </P> <P> Red Delicious, small no detectable level  </P> <P> McIntosh no detectable level  </P> <P> Red Delicious, large no detectable level  </P> <P> * Detectable level of Alar found  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Beatrice Taupin: "First Job -- A Bonus Replaces </F> the Youth Job Training Contract"]    [Excerpts] Without waiting for Tuesday's government  statement to the National Assembly on youth employment,  announced by Nicolas Sarkozy, the government spokesman, after  the Council of Ministers meeting, the Matignon [prime minister's  office] yesterday decided to abandon the CIP [Job Training  Contract] and unveiled an alternative measure. The government  has proposed granting aid to companies "employing, for a minimum  of 18 months, a young person who has never before had a stable  job." This aid, paid over nine months, will be worth 1,000  French francs [Fr] per month. It will be doubled for any young  people taken on before 1 October. A decree will implement the  measure as of next week.    The prime minister made his decision after discussions with  the employment minister and after hearing the report of  discussions held by Michel Bon with the social partners.  [passage omitted]  <H5>  Cost of Fr6 Billion </H5>   The National Council of French Employers [CNPF], whose hobby  horse is lowering labor costs, also approves of this measure:  "This clear and simple decision eliminates all ambiguity  concerning the levels of payment and the nature of any possible  training. In our eyes, it is a serious factor in calming the  concerns expressed by young people."    With the exception of the Workers' Force union [FO], which  contests the very principle of lowering wage costs, a fairly  general consensus is being reached on how to reduce charges  which, moreover, was also gone into by the Five-Year Plan [on  employment]. Since it is not now possible to directly alter  wages, the only alternative is to give aid to the companies --  whatever the cost.    The cost of the measures announced yesterday is evaluated at  around Fr6 billion in 1994 for 500,000 young people. No details  were given as to the source of this funding, which will further  widen the budget deficit, unless the windfall from privatization  is used, as it has been to recapitalize certain public companies!    By deciding to grant a fixed sum for everyone entering their  first job, whether or not they are qualified, the government is  steering clear of the pitfall of segregating young people, while  nevertheless favoring the low-paid. However, it is risking the  job placement of older workers, as occurred with Martine Aubry's  Exo-Jeunes scheme. However, the government undoubtedly has no  other alternative.</p>

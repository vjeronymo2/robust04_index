The YSP circles' proposal, which reflects the depth of the  crisis the united Yemeni state is experiencing, comes while  circles close to the YSP have begun to believe that "the  dialogue through the barrel of a gun" which began 21 February  has made the federation proposal appear to have been overtaken  by events.    In Cairo, Shaykh Sinan Abu-Lahhum, member of the Yemeni  Consultative Council and member of the Political Forces Dialogue  Committee -- who had issued a joint statement with Brigadier  Mujahid Abu-Shawarib, deputy prime minister, warning of  secession in Yemen -- urged Yemeni leaders to abandon their  differences and achieve reconciliation. He warned of the  possibility of Yemen turning into a new Somalia and the south  separating from the north. He said: "That would not solve the  problem, but, rather, would bring ruin to the country."    Abu-Lahhum attributed King Husayn's failure to achieve  reconciliation to "Yemeni leaders' intransigence and failure to  apply reason and reach an understanding." He described what is  happening as "madness and a frightening nightmare." He  expressed his fear that "the gap among Yemenis might widen and  result in undermining national unity."    Following a meeting with Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid, secretary  general of the Arab League, yesterday, he said: "The League is  making extensive endeavors to secure a way out of the current  crisis. This is in addition to numerous Arab mediations." He  noted that he is going to meet with President Husni Mubarak "to  ask him to intensify Egyptian efforts and reinforce Egypt's role  in ending Yemeni disputes."    He denied that he had asked the secretary general to  dispatch  a Arab force to disengage northern and southern forces. He  stressed that what Yemen needs is living consciences, not  forces. "And mediations do not require military forces, but  sincere intentions." He said that recent military clashes "have  left a deep wound in Yemeni hearts." He pointed out that the  "cause of the deterioration in conditions is officials' failure  to implement the Pledge and Accord Document signed in the  Jordanian capital recently."    In Sanaa, political and military sources spoke yesterday  about the Yemeni-Jordanian-Omani committee's failure to complete  the process of withdrawing military units from what used to be  known as the "fringes" area before unity, and to return these  units to their positions before the current crisis, which began  on 19 August last year.

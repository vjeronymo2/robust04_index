			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Markets: Personal equity plans increase in popularity - At a glance Personal equity plans, which allow individuals to invest in shares without paying income or capital gains tax, have become increasingly popular with savers. The 1992-93 tax year saw an inflow of Pounds 3.12bn invested in general plans - the highest since the launch of the first Peps in 1987. Some 770,000 new general plans were taken out during the course of the tax year. Single company Peps, which were introduced on January 1 1992 attracted a total of Pounds 640m into 250,000 plans by the end of the 1992-93 tax year. Pep investment was changed from a calendar year to a tax-year basis from April 1990. The Inland Revenue figures do not reflect withdrawals or growth in plan values.</p>

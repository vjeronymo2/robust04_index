			<p>BFN     [Text] The problem of the Black Sea Fleet should not affect  the possibility of and the date for Boris Yeltsin's visit to  Ukraine, INTERFAX-Ukraine was told on Tuesday [26 April] by the  head of the Ukrainian president's service for international  affairs, Anton Buteyko.    He said that at the talks in Sevastopol agreements were  outlined on the splitting of warships and vessels of the Black  Sea Fleet. There is also the decision of the presidents on the  Fleets' separate basing and we do not see any other variants,  said Buteyko.    He said that the presidents of Russia and Ukraine at the  recent meeting in Moscow stressed the priority importance for  the swift working out of the treaty on friendship and  cooperation between the two countries. Buteyko said that  Ukraine was prepared long ago for the signing of a comprehensive  agreement.    The spokesman also said that the Ukrainian side had sent its  proposals to Moscow on time. However, later the process had  become stalled.    Buteyko said that now a new impetus was given to the  preparatory process and Ukraine is doing everything possible so  that the document proves to be acceptable for both sides.</p>

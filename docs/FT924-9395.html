			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / UK Company News: HK Land in fresh move on Trafalgar HONGKONG Land, the Jardine Matheson-controlled Hong Kong property company, yesterday signalled its intention to keep up the pressure on Trafalgar House when it said it had an option to take its stake above 20 per cent. Hongkong Land, which has a 14.9 per cent stake in the UK property, construction and engineering group, said an investment house had entered into an option arrangement to buy 36m Trafalgar shares on February 3. As part of the option deal, Hongkong Land may be obliged to buy up to 67m shares until May 3. In both cases, it would pay no more than the 85p per share or 82p per A share it offered in its recent tender. The arrangement means Hongkong Land is almost certain to raise its stake to 20.07 per cent. Although it could increase its stake to 29.9 per cent, in practice it is only likely to be forced to buy another 67m shares if the share price falls well below 85p. However, by taking its stake above 20 per cent Hongkong Land will be able to equity-account its holding, enabling it to book a share of Trafalgar's profits. Trafalgar's ordinary and A shares yesterday closed at 83p and 80p respectively. Mr Alasdair Morrison, managing director of Hongkong Land, said yesterday he would be looking for further board representation. Trafalgar has already appointed Mr Rodney Leach, a director of Hongkong Land, to its board, but has turned down a request to appoint a second director from Hongkong Land to its board. Hongkong Land yesterday made it clear that its main priority over the next five months was to get another of its directors, Sir Charles Powell, to join Trafalgar's board. Mr Morrison described the option over Trafalgar as 'friendly'. He said Trafalgar's board was made aware of the company's intention to enter into the option arrangements. 'We wish to be a supportive, long-term investor,' he said. Trafalgar said it was relaxed about the move but is unlikely to be happy with the ease at which Hongkong Land has been able to lift its stake after Hongkong Land's tender offer for another 15 per cent failed.</p>

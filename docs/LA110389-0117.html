Friendly warned a crowd of 400 journalism  professionals and students at the Biltmore Hotel that journalism is "in danger  of becoming an amusement industry."  </P> <P> Friendly, former president of CBS News, was honored Wednesday night at the USC  School of Journalism' 30th annual Distinguished Achievement in Journalism  Awards Dinner.

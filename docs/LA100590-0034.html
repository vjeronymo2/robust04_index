			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> BARR SUES 2 TABLOIDS FOR PRINTING HER LOVE LETTERS  </P> <P> Television comedian Roseanne Barr and her husband, Tom Arnold, filed a  multimillion-dollar lawsuit Thursday alleging that two national tabloids stole  four love letters she had written to him and published them earlier this year.  </P> <P> The suit, in addition to alleging invasion of privacy, took the unusual  approach of invoking the RICO federal racketeering statute against the National  Enquirer and the Star. The U.S. District Court lawsuit said the supermarket  weeklies engaged in a pattern of racketeering and civil rights violations by  publishing the love letters.  </P> <P> The lawsuit did not say how Barr and Arnold believe the "intensely personal  letters" were pilfered, noting only that they were kept "in a private, and  presumably secure place."  </P> <P> But it attacked the publication of the letters as "despicable, extreme and  outrageous" and criticized the tabloids for using an "informant enterprise" to  gather juicy tidbits on celebrities through paid informants.  </P> <P> Star officials could not be reached for comment. The editor of the National  Enquirer discounted the $110-million suit as "ridiculous."  </P> <P> In an interview, Enquirer Editor and President Iain Calder declined to say  where the tabloid got the letters, published in February, but he said: "This is  just another pathetic publicity stunt by Roseanne. She is trashing the National  Enquirer, but we are in good company."  </P> <P> The legal action is only the latest salvo in Barr's running battle with the  tabloids, which she says have harassed her on her rise to stardom by running  stories of drug addiction and family fights, by following her and by paying  informants for information about her.  </P> <P> Barr's husband was once one of those informants, according to the Enquirer. The  reports later were acknowledged by Barr herself, who called it "a huge mistake"  and said Arnold apparently wanted to raise money for their honeymoon.  </P> <P> Barr and Arnold were in the studio of her weekly ABC-TV sitcom "Roseanne" on  Thursday and did not want to talk about the lawsuit, according to an assistant  who did not want to be identified. "They're laying low," the assistant said.  </P> <P> Likewise, Barr's attorney declined to discuss the suit, which in addition to  damages seeks a court order to prohibit the tabloids from using the letters  again and to force their return.  </P> <P> The Enquirer ran excerpts from the letters under the headline "Roseanne's Own  Words of Love -- Excerpts From Letter to Fiance."  </P> <P> Gavin de Becker, who has tangled with the tabloids often in his role as private  consultant to media stars, said Barr's suit "will be a far more challenging  courtroom battle than most that (the tabloids) face."  </P> <P> "What makes this significant is that it is not a libel suit, so it's out of the  domain of the Enquirer's speciality -- which is resisting libel suits," he  said. "I think they have a very difficult time ahead of them because this  lawsuit alleges criminal conduct that is clearly not protected by the First  Amendment."  </P></p>

Business activities resumed here, though the capital  remained  tense after thosands of young protesters, mainly students from  the Tutsi ethnic majority, brought the city to a standstill by  barring main roads on Thursday, while security forces stood by.    In one incident, five Tutsis were killed by a Hutu  neighbourhood leader in the northwestern Bujumbura suburb of  Cibitoke late Thursday, police said, but they gave no details.    Among those declared wanted Friday were the president of the  Rally for Economic and Social Development (RADDES), Joseph  Nzeyimana, several other leaders of that party, and the head of  a seven-party opposition coalition, Salvator Nzigamasabo.    All 14 had left their homes and gone into hiding, informed  sources said. Their arrests could lead to serious clashes,  observers said.    The demonstrations were staged to protest against the  arrival  of some 200 peacekeepers from the Organization of African Unity  (OAU), requested by the government following the October 21  attempted military coup.    The aborted coup, during which Burundi's first ethnic Hutu  president Melchior Ndadaye and several other government  officials were killed, sparked tribal massacres that left an  estimated 100,000 people dead.    The government accused the army and the police, who are  mostly Tutsis, of "complicity" in Thursday's shutdown of the  capital, which it feared could be related to a possible second  coup attempt.    The protestors had originally planned to continue their  demonstrations for three days, according to Employment Minister  Leonard Nyangoma.    In another development Friday, three opposition parties  chose  a joint candidate for the presidency, Jean Ndeberi, an academic  who teaches biology at the Burundi university and is president  of the Burundo-African Alliance for Salvation (ABASA).    The late Ndadaye's party, the Front for Democracy in Burundi  (FRODEBU), has put up Agricultural Minister Cyprien Ntaryamira  as its candidate.    The government and the opposition have not yet reached  agreement as to how the new president should be elected by  parliament, a measure which would need a constitutional  amendment.    Elections are not currently possible in Burundi, still at  risk from ethnic massacres. Some 700,000 people have fled to  neighbouring countries.</p>

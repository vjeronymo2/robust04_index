			<p>BFN     [Text] Islamabad, May 3 -- At long last Pakistan has been  able to make a breakthrough in acquisition of sophisticated  defence equipment from Russia for which it has been striving  hard for decades in its bid to diversify its defence  procurements.    In a major development, to begin with Russia has offered for  the first time to supply to Pakistan a well-guarded secret  helicopter technology of co-axial rotors and a helicopter with  no tail rotor blades.    Russia has entered the competition for supply of five  helicopters to Emergency Relief Cell of the Cabinet division  along with 30 other companies. Top on the list of Russian  helicopters is the State-of-Art K-32-T helicopter which not only  has a reputation of being the safest and the most economical  helicopter but it also holds the world record of landing at the  height of over 24,000 feet with two-men crew. What puts this  helicopter a class apart from the rest of the helicopters is  that it has no tail rotor blades which improves its flight  safety upto 40 percent and cuts down maintenance cost by 30  percent. Russia has also offered M-18, M1-17 and MI-171.    Tenders were opened in the committee Room of the Cabinet  Division on April 30 with 30 companies participating in the bid.  Tenders were opened in the presence of the D G  [Director-General] Emergency Relief Cell, Additional Secretary  Cabinet Division, a representative of the Army and the other  officials.    Emergency Relief Cell of the Cabinet Division had invited  tenders for the purchase of five helicopter -- three utility  version and two VIP version. Emergency Relief Cell had acquired  six UHIH aircraft from the USAID in 1970 for flood relief  operations. With the expiry of their life-span their  replacements were urgently required. The participants of the  bid included the manufacturers, leasing companies and one-time  go-getters for quick money. Serious offers came from the  manufacturing plants, from Bell Helicopter Textron USA,  Eurocopter, the manufacturers of Puma Helicopters from France,  ULAN-Ude the manufacturers of MI-171 helicopters of another  manufacturing plant of Russia. Conspicuous by their absence  from the tender bid were the largest helicopter manufacturing  plant of Russia Helicopters namely Kazan manufacturing plant.  Apparently this was aimed at reducing competition for sister  manufacturing plant of ULAN-Ude. This was evident from the fact  that ULAN-Ude offered an MI-171 helicopter of utility version at  US dollars 2.9 million and VIP version at US dollars 3.2 million  as against the offer of US dollars 1.5 million by Kazan plant to  Pakistan Army.    Prices offered for these helicopters from the original  manufacturers ranged from 15 million US dollars for Western  helicopters to US dollars 1.75 million for Russian helicopters.  Though the go-getter companies also offered helicopters at a low  price, the competence of these companies to actually deliver the  helicopters from Russia is seriously doubtful as the laws of the  Russian Federation do not permit such companies to export  helicopters for sale, the companies are only permitted to lease.    Though the prestigious helicopter manufacturing companies  from the Western countries are in the run for the tender, what  makes Russian offer unique is that it has been viewed in the  defence circles prior to Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's visit  to Moscow sometime in near future. Defence sources have  confirmed that Russia has been playing quite tough with Pakistan  on the possibility of defence compensation between the two  countries over the last two years.    Nothwithstanding the public pronouncements made from time to  time by the Pakistani functionaries for acquiring Russian-made  fighter-bombers SU27 and MIG 29, Russia had not until very  recently invited Pakistani experts for evaluations of these  bombers. Although Pakistani experts have completed evaluation,  no further progress has been reported. It has also been learnt  that the scheduled visit by the experts of the Pakistan Army was  cancelled by their Russian hosts at the eleventh hour last month.</p>

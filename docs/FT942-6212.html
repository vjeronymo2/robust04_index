			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / US resumes Japan insurance talks The US and Japan will have their first opportunity to put their newfound co-operative spirit to the test when they resume talks in Washington today on access to Japan's insurance market. The insurance sector will be the first specific issue the two countries will tackle since they agreed earlier this month to try to negotiate a framework for opening Japanese markets to foreign goods and services and to reduce Japan's current account surplus. The US has argued that Japan has structural barriers and regulations which hinder foreign penetration of the insurance market. Japan maintains that its insurance market is already quite open.</p>

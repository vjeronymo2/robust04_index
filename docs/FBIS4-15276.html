			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Anders Aslund `Debate' article: "A Threat to Europe"] </F>   [Text] A few months after the frightening outcome of the  elections in Russia we can stop holding our breath. Things are  not as bad as they once looked, and once again the prophets of  doom have been proved wrong.    So far the new Russian parliament is working much better  than  the old Supreme Soviet. It consists of eleven relatively  cohesive groups with a degree of party discipline. Businessmen  are no longer able to buy individual deputies. The parliament's  power is balanced, because the new constitution has introduced a  normal distribution of power.    The old Supreme Soviet had an overwhelming majority of  red-browns, but they have only 34 percent of seats in the new  Duma, and they are respecting the parliamentary rules.  Zhirinovskiy's closest allies are already beginning to abandon  him. The four democratic groupings are well represented with 35  percent of seats. In practice a number of centrist groupings  are dominant. The system of parliamentary compromises has begun  to work.    Regional leaders have taken their places on the Federation  Council, the parliament's upper chamber, the trend toward  dissolution inside Russia has softened considerably since the  new constitution was adopted. Even stubborn Tatarstan has come  to an agreement with Moscow.    Despite the fact that Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin was not a candidate in the elections, he appears  today to be the most powerful politician. He has a strong power  base in the state machine and heavy industry, at the same time  that he represents the parliamentary center and can play  democrats against the red-browns. In practice it is not  President Yeltsin but Chernomyrdin who has come to exercise the  strong executive power which the constitution gives to the  president.    As is well known the change in the economic system has  progressed far too slowly in Russia. In addition the democrats  have failed to get their message to the broad masses of the  people. That is why the old establishment has been given a  breathing space in which to recover. Its more progressive wing  led by Chernomyrdin has now won power. The KGB and other  sinister sections of the old Soviet establishment have in their  turn had time to reshape themselves into crime syndicates  because the process of liberalization has progressed so slowly.    Democracy has grown stronger and crime rates have fallen in  countries where the transition from one system to another has  been more radical and consistent, such as Poland and the Czech  Republic or Estonia and Latvia. In addition the social costs of  the change of system in Russia have been much larger than they  need have been.    Now that the alarm over the elections results has abated,  what is most surprising is how much has actually been achieved  through the change of system in Russia. Today Russia has a  market economy, even though it suffers from some distortions and  a high degree of lawlessness. Deregulation has largely been  implemented. More than half of those Russians in work are now  working in the private sector. The main question is how high  the level of inflation will be.    In January there were many of us who were worried by the  fact  that Chernomyrdin sounded as if he intended to abandon all  policies of stabilization. Now, with hindsight, it seems as if  he was indulging in some opportunistic hot air, partly to escape  criticism, and partly to force the liberal deputy prime  ministers, Yegor Gaydar and Boris Fedorov, to resign for  political reasons. In practice Chernomyrdin has now taken over  their economic policies.    Since October Russia has actually had an extraordinarily  tight monetary policy, which has forced down inflation to a  level of 11 percent in February. Since market interest rates  are at all of 20 percent per month (800 percent per year) Russia  has the world's highest level of real interest.    The budget deficit is still on the large side at 9 percent  of  GNP, but IMF chief Michel Camdessus was nevertheless  sufficiently impressed by the Russian attempts at a policy of  stabilization to agree -- on certain conditions -- to sign a new  stabilization agreement with Russia and grant Russia new credits.    Today's official targets are to bring inflation down to 7 to  9 percent per month by the end of the year, against last year's  average of 20 percent per month. The battle against inflation  ought to be more ambitious, in order to make possible economic  recovery, and the excessively hesitant anti-inflation policy  increases the cost to society.    However, the tough monetary policy has begun to bite on  large  enterprises which refused for as long as they could to adapt to  the laws of the market economy. In general bad enterprises with  no demand for their products do not go bankrupt, nor do they  fire employees. They simply scale down activities until they  are almost at a standstill. Salaries fall behind inflation and  are often paid three to four months late, so employees seek jobs  with better enterprises if they can. Almost all Russian  enterprises are now demanding advance payment from each other.    However, many enterprises are now experiencing great demand  and their biggest problem is that they are unable to increase  their production because of the combination of high inflation  which undermines their working capital and the high real  interest rates which mean that they cannot afford to take  credits. These enterprises are no longer calling for subsidized  credits but, on the contrary, for a stricter budgetary policy so  that real levels of interest rates fall.    The standard picture of Russia is of a country with  plummeting living standards, but this picture is false. After a  large fall in 1992 the recovery began in 1993. It is true that  official GNP fell by 12 percent in 1993, but remarkably enough  the population's income rose by all of 9 percent. One  explanation is that the share of private consumption rose from a  low of 36 percent in 1992 to 41 percent in 1993, while two  thirds of the GNP of Western countries goes to private  consumption.    When the share of private consumption is so small, the trend  of developments in GNP is not that important, but the Russians'  living standards are likely to rise sharply over the next few  years because consumption's share of GNP should increase  considerably.    Another explanation is that much of private production  cannot be measured because of tax evasion, while state  production was exaggerated under communism. In addition it can  only be good for living standards if the production of nuclear  arms, for example, decreases, even if GNP then falls.    Also, a properly functioning market produces a much better  distribution of resources. The most remarkable result is that  this year Russia looks as if it will be self-sufficient in  grain, while people were worried about starvation in Russia in  the winter of 1991/92. Today a large number of import goods  which raise living standards -- particularly medicines -- have  penetrate the whole of Russia.    Despite everything the Russian economy is on a pretty safe  track. Swedish businessmen are noticing this. In the first 11  months of 1993 Sweden's exports to Russia increased by a total  of 56 percent. Russia is in fact our most rapidly growing  export market.    What has frightened the West most since the Russian  parliamentary elections is the new Russian foreign policy which  asserts Russian interests with a ruthlessness that is new and  also reminiscent of the past. In the most recent edition of the  periodical, FOREIGN AFFAIRS, former U.S. security adviser  Zbigniew Brzezinski has criticized the U.S. administration for  pursuing a foreign policy that is too Russocentric and the  administration already seems to have changed its foreign policy  along the lines demanded by Brzezinski.    Brzezinski does not oppose the U.S. attempts hitherto to  support the economic and political stabilization of Russia, but  he advocates two important complementary policy strands. The  first is to incorporate the successful central Europe (and this  should include the Baltic region) into the West. As an American  Brzezinski advocates NATO membership, but EU [European Union]  membership is a natural alternative.    Brzezinski's other complementary strand is that the central  objective of a farsighted Western policy in the region should be  "to consolidate geopolitical pluralism inside the former Soviet  Union." His central thesis is: "Russia can either be an empire  or a democracy, but not both."    I personally believe that the fears that Russia will engage  in activity that will destabilize Eastern Europe are  exaggerated. Russia has had enough of the torment of the former  Soviet Union and its actions in Bosnia are most likely to teach  the West the lesson that Russia is a great power with its own  national interests which intends to play an active role in the  field of European security policy. Eastern Europe should,  however, be integrated into Europe if the sort of feeling of  national security which leads to stability is to be achieved.    Russia's policy toward the former Soviet republics, on  the other hand, gives cause for concern, but there still are  strong forces in Moscow which are working against attempts to  reincorporate former Union republics, since this would  destabilize Russia both politically and economically.    A telling example is how a potentially destabilizing  currency  union between Russia and Belarus recently came to nothing. The  more successful the fight against inflation in Russia, the  stronger grow the anti-imperialist forces in Russia. This is  why it is important for the rest of the world to support a  stabilization of the Russian economy.    If former Soviet republics collapse, however, it will be  extraordinarily difficult for a government in Moscow not to  intervene. It is difficult for the rest of the world to  criticize Russia's involvement in civil-war-torn Tajikistan and  it has no alternative to Russian "peacekeeping" forces in the  Caucasus.    Economic destabilization is probably a serious threat. A  total of nine out of fifteen former Soviet republics suffered  hyperinflation -- more than 50 percent inflation in any single  month -- in 1993. Among the other former Soviet republics only  the three Baltic republics have been more successful  economically than Russia. Veritable shock therapy as in Estonia  and Latvia seems to produce the best results, but attempts to  carry out a radical change of system are the next best thing.  Things are worst when countries like Ukraine try to carry out a  gradual change of system.    The worst threat to European security is the far-reaching  destabilization of the Ukrainian economy. In time Ukraine's  hyperinflation must lead to both social and political  destabilization, and regardless what government is in power in  Moscow Russia will be unable to remain an onlooker. This is why  the collapse of Ukraine could also be a catastrophe for Russia  and the rest of the world.    The central objective for the West's security policy  should therefore be to work to prevent the collapse of the  Ukraine. The main problem is that the whole of the Ukrainian  political leadership with President Leonid Kravchuk at its head  seems to be totally irresponsible and corrupt, while the  Ukrainian population is embarrassingly passive. However, the  Ukrainian parliamentary elections may have made a democratic  revolution possible.    The West's first priority should be to contribute to  enlightenment in Ukraine and make it clear that it is possible  to achieve Ukraine's economic salvation through a radical change  of system. At the same time the West must alleviate the shock  by making substantial credits available if Ukraine initiates a  credible change of system.</p>

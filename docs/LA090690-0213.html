			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CORTEX GETS GRANT FOR DRUG FOR BRAIN CELL REGENERATION  </P> <P> Cortex Pharmaceuticals Inc., a company founded by three neuroscientists from UC  Irvine, said Wednesday that it has received a federal grant to begin developing  a drug that may regenerate brain cells destroyed by Alzheimer's disease and  strokes.  </P> <P> Kathleen Cavanaugh, the lead biochemist on the research project at the Irvine  firm, said the $45,000 grant from the U.S. Public Health Service will fund the  first phase of study to be completed by the end of the year.  </P> <P> Cortex, she said, plans to expand upon the laboratory research of Carl W.  Cotman, a professor of psychobiology at UC Irvine who co-founded the company in  1987.  </P> <P> Several years ago, Cotman identified a chemical compound that helps to spur the  growth of neurons in the brain that are critical to enabling memory and other  brain functions, Cavanaugh said.  </P> <P> "These neurons die in people with Alzheimer's disease and after strokes and  heart attacks, when the blood supply is cut off to the brain," she said.  </P> <P> Under the grant, she said, Cortex will develop and study structurally similar  compounds in search of one that would have optimum therapeutic value.  </P> <P> "We are testing the compounds on brain neurons in petri dishes to see if they  help the neurons survive longer," she said.  </P> <P> An important advantage of the family of chemical compounds being investigated,  Cavanaugh said, is that they can be absorbed into the brain through the blood  system and could be administered as a pill.  </P> <P> If the first phase of research is successful, Cavanaugh said, the company will  apply for a "second phase" Small Business Innovation Research grant of up to  $500,000 from the Public Health Service to conduct more extensive laboratory  tests.  </P></p>

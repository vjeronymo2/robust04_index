			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Indonesia power scheme THE Indonesian government has approved an investment licence for Mission Energy of the US to build a Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.42bn) power station at Paiton in East Java. The licence follows the personal intervention of President Suharto after negotiations between the government and Mission Energy stalled last December. The project, which consists of two coal-fired 600 MW power units, will be Indonesia's first privately built, owned and operated station linked directly into the national grid. The plant is at the heart of the government's drive to attract private companies into the power sector. Donors estimate Indonesia must invest Dollars 30bn into the national grid this decade to satisfy demand, one-third of which should come from private investors.</p>

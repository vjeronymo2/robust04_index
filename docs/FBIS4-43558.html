			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Helmut Maier-Mannhart: "From First to Second </F> Gear"]    [Text] The economic recovery during the first quarter of  this year was stronger than generally expected. The increase of  the GDP by 2.1 percent compared with the same period last year  in western Germany was the first increase in the annual  comparison since 1992. However, this result needs to be  interpreted, because it could easily lead to incorrect  conclusions. Of course, following the deep valley of recession  of 1993, such a figure is primarily good news, because it makes  clear that the recovery has intensified and has gained ground.  The danger of a relapse, which was hanging over the German  economy like the sword of Damocles for the past months, may now  be considered finally banished.    However, things get problematic if one takes the growth rate  at face value and even extrapolates it, because there is no  doubt that it exaggerates the actual development. This is  primarily due to the fact that this 2.1 percent refers to an  extremely low statistical base. During the first quarter of  1993 the recession had reached its absolute low point. This  means that, for instance, the corresponding rate for the second  quarter will be considerably lower, because during the  comparable period last year the economic development had already  stabilized a bit. By the way, the development of the GDP also  shows that the recovery is progressing a bit more slowly.  Compared with the fourth quarter of 1993, the overall output of  the German economy during the first quarter increased only by a  moderate 0.5 percent.    However, this does not change anything about the fact that  one may revise the forecast for the entire year 1994 slightly  upward against the background of the figures of the quarter.  The Ifo Institute has just done that; the economic researchers  from Munich now expect an increase of the real GDP in the west  by 1.5 to 2 percent in contrast to the 1.5 percent mentioned in  the spring report of the research institutes. In the new  laender, where the institute expects a strong increase of  investments to 160 million German marks [DM], an overall  economic growth of at least 7.5 percent is considered possible.  However, here, too, it is important that the considerably  better result this year will form the platform for a further  growth next year, which could then reach 3 percent or perhaps  even a bit more.    Unfortunately, all this has hardly any effect on the labor  market. According to Ifo, the number of unemployed in the west  will once again grow by 300,000 to 2.6 million on annual average  this year; in the east it will probably go up by another 50,000.  The current decline in May to 2.5 million (west) and 1.15  million (east) is largely seasonal; practically no stimuli by  the economic development are felt as yet.    And what does this growth process consist of? The main  elements still come from abroad. This is shown, first, in the  foreign trade balance, where goods exports skyrocketed to DM61.2  billion in March (February DM50.7 billion). Even though imports  also increased strongly -- to DM53.8 billion following 44.9  billion -- the surplus in foreign trade rose to DM7.4 billion  (previous month DM5.8 billion). The order statistic, too, still  shows an excess in foreign orders. In the two-month comparison  of March/April with January/February orders in the processing  industry rose by an average of 6 percent. Germany contributed  an increase by 5 percent to this and other countries an increase  by 8 percent. However, the April figures indicate that the wind  might be changing. In April orders increased by 0.6 percent  compared with the previous month, whereby domestic orders were 2  percent higher and foreign orders declined by 1.5 percent.  Still, such a monthly result is not yet a guarantee that  domestic orders are recovering, but it would certainly  correspond to the usual pattern of the economic development if  the export orders, which have increased for quite some time,  would soon give rise to more orders also at home. As a result  of the increasing number of orders received, industry has  switched to the next higher gear in output. In April output  rose by 2.5 percent compared with May and by 4.1 percent  compared with last year.    There are two circumstances that are irritating at the  threshold to the economic summer. First, the companies'  inclination toward investments is still not very high and,  second, interest rates have been rising for some months. An Ifo  poll has shown that industry is planning a nominal plus in  investments of only 0.5 percent, which probably means a real  minus of about 2 percent. This reflects the fact that the  companies still have considerable reserves in capacity and that  one still needs a certain time in upswing before investments in  expansions are ordered. As regards private consumption, on the  other hand, it has developed far better than predicted. While  one rather had to expect a decline because of the declining real  income as a result of higher taxes, private consumption rose by  1 percent during the first quarter of 1994 compared with the  last quarter of 1993. This shows that the citizens want to  maintain their standard of living even if incomes go down and  that they rather accept a declining savings quota instead.  However, in April retail trade suffered a virtual slump with a  decline of 9 percent. Nevertheless, there is the prevalent  opinion that, even though private consumption will not be able  to make a contribution to the upswing in this period, it will,  on the other hand, at least not cause any damage to the economic  development.  <H5>  Interest Risks </H5>   In contrast, the rise in the capital market interest rate to  more than 7 percent now does not quite fit the situation. The  economic development has by far not reached a stage at which it  would be appropriate to make long-term money, which is essential  for investments, more expensive. This is all the less so since  the development of prices over the previous months has led  downward; in April the inflation rate was 2.9 percent, thus  being below the 3- percent mark for the first time in three  years. Certainly, the interest rate is still below the long-term  average, but the signal given by the rising interest rate is  problematical. Even though the Bundesbank is doing everything  possible to push short-term interest rates downward, one can see  once again that its arm is not long enough to reach the end.    Despite all assumptions to the contrary, it is obviously not  possible to decouple the development of the capital market in  Germany from that in the United States. When the interest rate  is still at least 0.5 percent higher and keeps rising, this is  certainly appropriate to the situation in view of the U.S.  economic development, which is in full swing. In our country,  however, this could brake the upswing, which would be anything  but desirable in the coming months.    What applies to Germany also applies to the international  economy as a whole: The recession has been overcome, but  climbing out of the valley is difficult. The only exception is  the United States, where the economy is currently growing at an  annual rate of 5 percent. Japan, on the other hand, still has  difficulties. The high exchange rate of the yen is an enormous  brake on the recovery, the domestic programs for stimulation  have not yet had an effect. Therefore, a considerable increase  of the GDP is expected only for next year. In West Europe,  Great Britain and Norway are the pacemakers of the economic  development. In total, the HWWA [Hamburg Archive for World  Economy] expects an increase in the GDP of the West European  states by 1.5 percent, with accelerating growth during the  second half of the year. In 1994 the volume of international  trade will probably rise by 5 to 6 percent and thus reach  approximately the speed of expansion it had during the second  half of the 1980's.</p>

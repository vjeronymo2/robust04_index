			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Philippines has asked the Association of  Southeast Nations, or ASEAN, to adopt a more open attitude  toward newly liberalized countries in the region. These  countries are Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar [Burma], and Vietnam. The  call was made by the Philippine delegation to the special  meeting of the ASEAN senior officials held recently in Bangkok.    Delegation head Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Rodolfo  Severino called on ASEAN to eventually accept these newly  industrialized [as heard] countries into the association. He  said the inclusion of these four countries in ASEAN could  prevent future conflicts and promote political stability and  economic progress.</p>

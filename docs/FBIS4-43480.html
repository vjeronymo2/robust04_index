			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "European Union/Finland: European </F> Membership Terms Ratified"]    [Text] (ANSA) Copenhagen, June 15 -- The Finnish parliament  has approved the terms under which that nation agrees to join  the European Union [EU], in an unofficial confidence call for  Prime Minister Esko Aho's center-right government.    The tally was 97 in favor, 80 against, with 18 abstentions  and 4 absentees. Aho had said that failure to approve the terms  of Finnish adherence to the EU would seriously delay that  country's timetable for joining.</p>

			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / World Trade News: US steelmakers will appeal ITC ruling THE SIX biggest steelmakers in the US filed an appeal yesterday against an official ruling two months ago which had overturned tarrifs aimed at preventing dumping of foreign steel in the US. The appeal was against rulings in 42 cases by the International Trade Commission, mainly in the area of relatively low margin hot-rolled and cold-rolled steel. The ITC failed to find evidence of dumping by foreign steelmakers, leading it to overturn tarrifs imposed by the Commerce Department. Foreign producers have already filed their own appeals against 30 rulings after the ITC had found evidence of dumping of the more profitable corrosion-resistant steel. The six said they would 'vigorously defend' against these appeals.</p>

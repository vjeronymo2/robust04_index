			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Survey of World Nuclear Industry (5): At a strategic crossroads - UK wrestles with the waste dilemma THE question of how to dispose of accumulating nuclear waste is confronting UK politicians as they prepare to debate the future of nuclear power. The UK has not resolved the issues of how to treat the waste from its nuclear power stations, or where to put the scrapped stations when they come to the end of their lives. The uncertainties about the costs - and about who will pay - scuppered plans to privatise the nuclear industry three years ago. They will haunt also the government's forthcoming review of nuclear power. At the heart of the question are some of the thorniest environmental decisions facing the government. Countries who are signatories to the international London Dumping Convention voted last week to ban permanently dumping of radioactive waste at sea. The UK has 100 days to decide whether to opt out and incur international criticism. The UK has already agreed to a 15-year temporary ban under a separate treaty, the Paris and Oslo convention, but reserved the right to start dumping again at that point. However, if it abides by the LDC vote, it must look more urgently at disposal routes on land. But there too it faces tough decisions. Ministers are due to announce soon whether they will give the go-ahead to the Pounds 2.89bn Thorp reprocessing plant at Sellafield in Cumbria, which will treat used or 'spent' fuel. In the next few years they must also decide whether to build a long term storage dump in the rocks under Sellafield. To environmentalists, the problems of disposing of nuclear waste are one of the most powerful arguments against nuclear power. Mr Simon Roberts, energy campaigner at Friends of the Earth, the 'green' pressure group, says: 'what right have we to leave this contamination for future generations?' Greenpeace, one of the UK's largest environmental pressure groups, has also challenged the government in court on its support for Thorp. Nuclear waste is normally divided into three categories by the intensity of the emitted radiation. Low-level waste - more than 90 per cent of waste in the UK - includes operators' protective clothing, packaging and other material which has been exposed to low doses of radiation. Intermediate level waste typically includes metal scraps, sludges and resins; high-level waste mainly consists of used fuel rods from reactors. Much of the UK's waste has been generated by the military side of the nuclear industry, from development of submarines and missiles. But within 15 years it will have to begin handling the waste from decommissioning the ageing Magnox reactors. Some of the waste is bulky, particularly the large steam generators or boilers from these plants, and eventually the concrete structures themselves, one reason behind Britain's preference for sea dumping. At the moment, the UK's low-level waste is stored at ground-level at Drigg, in Cumbria, and intermediate level waste is stored around the country at the sites where it has been produced. High-level waste is sent to the government-owned British Nuclear Fuels' plant at Sellafield where it is reprocessed and stored. However Nirex, the government's Nuclear Industry Radioactive Waste Executive, which has been established to provide long-term storage, is investigating whether a permanent repository for low and medium level waste could be carved out of the rocks below Sellafield. This summer, the government's Radioactive Waste Management Advisory Committee voiced reservations about the choice of site. Part of its concern is that preliminary tests showed upward pressure in the underground water table at that point, suggesting a risk that radioactivity could enter the water courses. RWMAC also warned that because of the need for further geological tests, it was unlikely that the repository would be ready before 2010, three years behind schedule, even if all concerns were adequately answered. Nirex is due soon to apply for planning permission for a small underground laboratory to begin answering these questions. Meanwhile, the government must decide about Thorp, after weighing up responses to the recent public consultation, the second in the plant's history. Thorp, which also has orders from Japanese and German utilities, is designed to separate reusable uranium and plutonium from used nuclear fuel, leaving a smaller amount of true waste. BNFL, which has spent more than 10 years building the plant, says that all questions were answered by the 1977 Windscale inquiry which gave the go-ahead for Thorp's construction. However, the plant's critics, notably Greenpeace, argue that Thorp's operation will increase the amount of plutonium in the world and so contribute to the risk of proliferation of nuclear weapons. They add that dry storage - temporary storage of unseparated spent fuel for several decades - is emerging as a cheaper alternative. Scottish Nuclear, the nuclear generator, has already announced that it is opting for dry storage for some of its spent fuel, although it adds that it believes the nuclear industry would suffer if Thorp did not go ahead. Many of these choices depend on comparison of the costs of the different options. Some of those costs are not yet clear - as in Nirex's case. Others depend greatly on policy decisions, such as the method and timing of the Magnox decommissioning.</p>

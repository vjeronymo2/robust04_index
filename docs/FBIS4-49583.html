			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 9 (XINHUA) -- China produced 210.9  billion kwh [kilowatt hours] of electricity in the first quarter  of this year, about 10 percent more than the same period of last  year.    According to the Ministry of the Power Industry, this figure  is 24 percent of the planned annual target of 890 billion kwh.    Of the total, 183.4 billion kwh were produced by thermal  power plants and 27.5 billion kwh by hydroelectric power  stations.    An official from the ministry said eight power grids along  the coast produced more electricity than the six others in the  interior.    Despite the increase, the power supply is still far short of  demand.    By the end of last year China's power generating capacity  had  reached 181 million kw and another 12 million kw will be added  this year.    China plans to add 16 million kw of generating capacity  every  year from 1995-2000 so as to bring the country's total  generating capacity up to some 300 million kw by the turn of the  century.    The Ministry of Power Industry expects another ten percent  increase in power production in the second quarter.</p>

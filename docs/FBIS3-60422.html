The  national coordinator for combating AIDS, Dr. Stanislava Popova,  presented a programme for the prevention and control of AIDS.  The first steps would be the holding of seminars aimed to work  out the principles of a general national strategy for fighting  the disease. The first one, intended for journalists writing on  the problems of AIDS, opens tomorrow.    AIDS tests have been provided through the Ministry of Health  and the World Health Organization, preventive research on those  lines is also conducted. Condoms produced by leading companies  are regularly supplied with the assistance of the World Health  Organization and a number of health-care institutions and  foundations.

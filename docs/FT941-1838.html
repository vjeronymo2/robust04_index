			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / World Commodities Prices: Silver leads gold to two-month high - Market report The London GOLD price was fixed at the highest level since January 20 after a buying spree, which started in the silver pit of the New York Commodity Exchange, set-off buying stop-loss orders. The yellow metal ended at Dollars 389.25 a troy ounce, while SILVER was up 16 cents at Dollars 5.57 1/2 an ounce. The market had been very steady before the futures opened, buoyed by continuing tensions in South Africa and concerns over the deployment of US missiles in South Korea. At the London Metal Exchange COPPER edged up on the back of commission house and merchant buying, although the move failed above Dollars 1,950 a tonne, for three months delivery, which dampened sentiment in other metals. Three months ALUMINIUM ended the day at Dollars 1,334 a tonne, down from its high of Dollars 1,340 but up on Monday's Dollars 1,328 close. Speculative and merchant sales were blamed for the late fall. London Commodity Exchange COFFEE futures set fresh highs, the May position climbing to Dollars 1,355 a tonne before ending the day at Dollars 1,354, up Dollars 23. Some dealers said they were slightly surprised by the rise, which they thought might reflect a trade house buying in London and selling in New York.

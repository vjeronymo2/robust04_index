			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 7 (KCNA) -- "On the review of the  performance of the state budget of the DPRK for 1993 and the  state budget for 1994," the second agenda item, is now under  discussion at the second-day sitting of the 7th session of the  Ninth Supreme People's Assembly [SPA] here.    According to the report delivered by Deputy Yun Ki-chong,  minister of finance, the total revenue of the state budget last  year was 40,571,200,000 won, or 100.3 percent of the plan and  2.6 percent up on the previous year, and the total expenditure  of the state budget was 40,242,970,000 won, or 99.5 percent of  the plan and 2.4 percent up on the previous year.    Last year, the DPRK Government increased the appropriations  for the national economy 2.5 percent, those for the development  of science and technology 7 percent and those for education 3.5  percent as against 1992.    Last year, the DPRK Government allocated 11.5 percent of the  total expenditure of the state budget for national defence.    The state budget for 1994 has been worked out in such a  manner as to concentrate the financial resources of the nation  on implementing the agriculture-first, light industry-first and  foreign trade-first policies according to the revolutionary  economic strategy laid down by the Workers' Party of Korea and  giving precedence to the preferential sectors of the national  economy, and increase the potential of the socialist independent  economy of the country.    The total revenue and expenditure for 1994 are both set at  41,525,190,000 won, or 2.4 percent up in revenue and 3.2 percent  up in expenditure above last year.    The DPRK Government has earmarked 11.6 percent of the total  expenditure of the state budget for this year for national  defence in order to consolidate the defence capabilities of the  nation in face of the enemy's war provocation moves.</p>

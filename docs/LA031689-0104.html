			<p><P> March 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOSPITAL USES METAL DETECTORS TO SCREEN ARMS;  </P> <P> CITES GANG VIOLENCE, THREATS TO MEDICAL STAFF  </P> <P> Metal detectors have been installed this week at two key entry points to Martin  Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center in Watts to screen out weapons carried into  the hospital by growing numbers of "violent and unruly individuals," hospital  officials said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Up to 60 gang members at a time have converged on the 430-bed county hospital  to visit their wounded friends or to intimidate rivals, said Robert Eason, the  hospital's chief of safety police.  </P> <P> They have barged into the emergency room, camped outside the third-floor  operating rooms and marched up to the fifth-floor pediatrics ward, where people  under 17 are treated, Eason said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Scared to Work Here'  </P> <P> "People are scared to work here," said Bob McCloskey, business agent for Local  660 of the Service Employees International Union, which represents nurses and  other medical personnel at King. "The gang-bangers who come here are interested  in seeing their partners live or their enemies die."  </P> <P> Nurse Ethel Edmond recalled treating a patient about a year ago when his  friends suddenly barged into the emergency room and threatened: "If he dies,  you die."  </P> <P> Edmond said she shot back: "If you really want to save your friend, go give  some blood." They did.  </P> <P> Tension in the emergency room escalates, Edmond said, "when rival gang members  are in the emergency room at the same time. That's when the problems start. . .  . Gangs come in to see how a member is or to retaliate."  </P> <P> Hospital administrator William Delgardo said that so far "there has never been  a shooting on the grounds." He called the metal detectors an "ounce of  prevention."  </P> <P> Eason said several Veterans Administration hospitals are protected by metal  detectors, as is the psychiatric hospital at County-USC Medical Center.  </P> <P> Usually, Eason said, the safety officers at King are able to handle  confrontations. But about a year ago, he said, gang members put the hospital  under virtual siege.  </P> <P> He recalled that about five carloads of gang members arrived at the hospital  and converged suddenly on the lobby of the emergency room.  </P> <P> "We couldn't catch them," Eason said. "They outnumbered us three to one. It  happened so fast we had to ask the sheriff to bring help."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Terrorizing People'  </P> <P> Edmond recalled, "They were terrorizing people in the waiting room and they  stole a janitor's cart."  </P> <P> The sheriff arrived with helicopters, cars and dogs. King personnel were  ordered not to leave the hospital, and paramedics with other patients were  directed into the hospital through a back door.  </P> <P> In a bulletin issued this month to King personnel, Eason stated: "Our  psychiatric and emergency rooms have been inundated with unruly and violent  individuals that have caused considerable concern for personal safety. . . .  The acquisition . . . of metal detectors will enable us to detect and  progressively deter the presence of objects which are . . . used as weapons."  </P> <P> "It's real scary working here," Edmond said. "Safety has been an issue for a  long time."  </P> <P> Eason said that he ordered three metal detectors two years ago but that they  were delayed by budget problems.  </P> <P> Two detectors -- each costing about $4,000 -- have just arrived. One has been  set up at the entrance to the Augustus F. Hawkins Mental Health Building, which  houses several out-patient psychiatric treatment programs and four in-patient  wards. The other has been set up at the entrance to the pediatric wards, which  have about 50 beds. They will be operative next week.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Remodeling Necessary  </P> <P> A third metal detector is on order for the emergency room, Eason said. But the  area will have to be substantially remodeled to accommodate it.  </P> <P> Edmond said that a metal detector for the emergency room would be "heaven. . .  . It would be great." She said that patients have stashed butcher knives and  other weapons in drawers in the emergency room. A few months ago, she said, a  deranged man was apprehended in the emergency room lobby waving a gun.  </P> <P> Safety concerns have made it extremely difficult to recruit nurses needed to  fill more than 90 vacancies, she added.  </P></p>

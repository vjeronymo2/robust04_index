			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 28 KYODO -- Moriyoshi Sato, who is to  head the Hokkaido and Okinawa Development Agencies, is known to  be a tenacious politician. Sato, 72, is a member of the  coalition's core party Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party).    Sato made three abortive attempts to win a seat in the lower  house before finally being elected to the House of  Representatives.    He is currently serving his 9th term in the lower house.  With the appointment Sato, a self-declared close aide of  disgraced LDP [Liberal Democratic Party] kingpin Shin Kanemaru,  returns to the political spotlight.    It was Sato who in August 1992 read out Kanemaru's statement  announcing his resignation from the LDP vice presidency over his  acceptance of 500 million yen in undeclared donations from a  scandal-ridden trucking firm.    Sato, who hails from Hiroshima, is said to have adapted  quickly to the post-Kanemaru era, distancing himself from the  fallen LDP powerbroker.    While serving as agriculture minister, Sato managed to break  the deadlock in fishery rights negotiations with the former  Soviet Union in 1985. In his LDP days, he gained experience  mainly in the fields of transport and telecommunications.    He has also served as National Land Agency director general.</p>

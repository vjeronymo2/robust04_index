Today when there are too many books, but insufficient time and attention for them, I have no choice but to indulge in a wrap-up article - a form beloved by literary editors but which I normally much dislike. There is, however, a sort of historical progression among these particular books. John Fforde's official history of the Bank of England covers the post-war period up to the end of the 1950s. Sir Alec Cairncross has marked his 80th birthday by writing, editing or contributing towards no fewer than three volumes. The Legacy of the Golden Age refers to the 1960s and reports a birthday conference. The book that he has co-authored on the IMF crisis of 1976 draws on an earlier first-hand account by Edmund Dell, who was Trade Secretary at the time and almost the only Cabinet minister who believed in the IMF programme  -the others believed in lip service at most. Dell's book has a freshness and on-the-spot quality which no subsequent historian could hope to match. The nakedness of the British Keynesian economic establishment in the face of stagflation (unemployment plus inflation) comes out in this episode. Dell brings out how split and helpless the Treasury had become, with Sir Douglas Wass, the permanent secretary, and the economists fundamentally sympathetic to Labour's resistance, and the overseas officials wanting to make fresh spending cuts for vague reasons of confidence. An ironic feature is that Dell was more in favour of Denis Healey's pro-IMF position than Healey himself, who could not wait to declare what he elegantly called 'sod-off day' with the Fund. As for his later claim that the agonies would have been unnecessary with better forecasts of the Budget and balance of payments deficits, Dell remarks: 'One measure of successful economic management is independence of forecasting errors.' The most disappointing volume, with the exception of James Buchanan's contribution, is that in which eminent economists give their 'life philosophies'. The editor, Michael Szenberg, has somehow caught the wrong generation. These are the first generation of economists at or nearing retirement, who aspired to see in their subject a hard science. Many of them profess to be bewildered, flattered or amazed at being asked for such essays. They give us everything from a potted history of their own research to folk wisdom and bizarre homespun metaphysical systems. Their politics show a yearning for active government or market socialism, even though quite a few of them have their roots in central and eastern Europe. The long and variable lags in publishing mean that they have not been forced to take on board events in their homeland. Mention of long and variable lags brings me to what, despite all differences about the ERM, is the one of these books that I would take to a desert island, that by Milton Friedman. It also has the longest historical sweep from 'stone money' at the dawn of history to US 'bimetallist' advocates of a combined silver and gold standard and the choices facing countries trying to stabilise prices after decades of many-digit inflation; and it gives an accessible account of Friedman's main positive ideas. But the student of British economic policy must earn his right to read Friedman under a palm tree by first reading how monetary policy was seen by the post-war Bank. Fforde, a former Bank economist and executive director, attracted attention in the early 1980s with his outspoken objections to the Thatcher government's monetarism as a form of theology of which the Bank wanted no part. In this history he shows himself as sceptical towards the Bank's own pieties. The whole book can be read as an argument for an independent and accountable Bank, with much emphasis on the second adjective. But it is an argument based not on an admiration for the Bank's positive performance, but rather the opposite. As early as 1945, the Governor of the Bank of Canada, Graham Towers, wrote to Lord Keynes: 'The half-way arrangement under which the central bank is neither a department of government pure and simple, nor directly responsible to the public for its actions, may contain the worst elements of both worlds.' Fforde himself writes of the Bank's tendering of advice to the government in private, 'to the probable detriment of public understanding of important issues'. And its emphasis on its role as an intermediary between Whitehall and the banking system 'brought little advantage to either'. Just so. There is also a mild sort of bete noire in his story in the unlikely shape of Lucius Thompson McCausland, a self-taught adviser to the Governors, who had the temerity not to have an economics degree, but who was attached to 'ingenious schemes'. As far as I remember, the 'Maudling Plan' for dealing with the imagined shortage of international liquidity which he devised in the 1960s was no worse than any other. This new history is also a quarry of information on the ill-fated Operation Robot - a plan to make sterling convertible at a floating rate in 1952, vetoed by Churchill on Lord Cherwell's advice. The choice between a domestic and an external monetary constraint is a matter of time and place and I have always had a retrospective sympathy for Robot, which is quite consistent with later support for the European Monetary System. A floating and convertible pound in the 1950s might have brought forward by two or three decades the dash for economic freedom without the need for the passions of the Thatcher era. The part of the book with greatest contemporary relevance is oddly enough the early part which deals with the Bank's profoundly unsatisfactory response to post-war nationalisation, when it had an opportunity to seek clearly defined responsibilities, but confined its attention to the narrower question of statutory powers over banks. Indeed, my own earliest memories of the Bank was the passion with which some of the directors felt that bank lending should be regulated neither by interest rates nor by controls, but by the Governor and his subordinates talking gentleman-to-gentleman to the clearing banks. Even then it was obvious that this approach, besides being repellent, had no chance of surviving the advent of newcomers from outside the club. But what an abdication from the great issues of the day to concentrate on this client relationship] Another memory of those days is of Sir Maurice Parsons, a deputy Governor (who became 'morose, difficult' and worse after the 1967 devaluation), complaining that I had asked very politely to see the information on which his sweeping judgments were based. Indeed, as I recount in my own contribution to the Cairncross inquest on the 1960s, it was the appallingly bad case put up by the advocates of sound money in the Bank and elsewhere which made me believe at the time in growthmanship, ie: using rapid demand expansion to stimulate industry into more vigorous performance. The demonstration that the end result would be inflation without more growth or jobs came from Friedman, while the Bank was mainly preoccupied with the immorality of letting down sterling balance holders. For a synoptic view of all the post-war era, including the 1980s, we return again to Cairncross. Has all the agonising been about nothing? Cairncross in the conclusion to his economic history points out how steady the British economic growth rate has been, at about 2 1/4 per cent per annum over many decades. The striking feature is how continental growth rates have fallen from earlier highs; so that the period started with lamentations about the British growth gap and ended with disputes about whether the gap had been closed in the 1980s. In terms of output per head of population the differences were nothing like as great as popularly supposed. He remarks that the great failure has been not growth, but the fading of full employment. Cairncross adds: 'Most of the reasons why governments intervene relate to infrastructure, health, the environment, monopolistic influence, and so on, not to innovation and productivity.' Would this were all] He is sceptical about claims that events would have been different under different policies. 'We find in government a convenient scapegoat for outcomes of which we disapprove.' He believes that national governments will occupy less and less of the stage; and so far as we look to policies at all, they will have to come from institutions, which are international in character. Such institutions seem to me to be even more cumbersome, slow moving, and bound to last year's fashions than the national variety. But we shall survive.</p>

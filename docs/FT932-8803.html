			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / International Company News: Thai Airways declines to Bt449.6m THAI Airways International reported a decline in second-quarter earnings to Bt449.6m (Dollars 18m) from Bt521.1m in the same period a year earlier. The results represent a substantial improvement on the first quarter, when net profits tumbled to Bt120m from Bt792.2m. Profits for the first six months were Bt568.4m compared with Bt1.31bn in 1992. The company had predicted that a stronger performance from domestic services and cost cutting would help patch up earnings in the second quarter. The airline has been hit by increased costs, falling demand and fierce competition. Gross revenues in the first quarter were little changed but operating revenues dipped by almost 2 per cent. Analysts in Bangkok said the airline was still likely to miss substantially its forecast of profits of Bt6.1bn for this year as a whole. Barclays De Zoete Wedd downgraded its earnings forecast for the full year to Bt2.2bn from Bt4bn after the first-quarter results. The airline included aircraft sales in its figures, which partly explained the big swings in profits.</p>

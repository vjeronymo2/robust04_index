			<p><P> April 25, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS  </P> <P> San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co.: The San Diego utility posted first-quarter  earnings of $56 million, up 56% from a year ago.  </P> <P> Revenue totaled $539.5 million, a gain of 8%. The firm said results were  depressed by the Public Utilities Commission's 1989 decision to disallow the  utility $25 million in costs to import power over the Southwest Powerlink.  However, the firm benefited from reduced utility operating and maintenance  costs and improved earnings of its subsidiaries.  </P></p>

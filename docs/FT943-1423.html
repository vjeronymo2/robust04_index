			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Major plays for success all round the political park: Cricket cheers in South Africa may find an echo on the prime minister's home wicket Arms stretched high, fingers stabbing the sky, Mr John Major glowed with pride as cheers rolled around the crowd watching him bowl at South Africa's Alexandra township cricket ground. It was a spontaneous gesture that revealed, for a fleeting moment, the human being inside the grey suit. What a pity, Mr Major must be reflecting, that the cheers were only for his cricket skills. The prime minister describes himself as a 'sports nut'. Yet he would give up sport for good in exchange for that kind of enthusiastic support for his government, dogged by the fall-out from recession, internal squabbling and ridicule of the ill-fated back-to-basics campaign. Mr Major is unlikely to be offered a better opportunity to rise above domestic troubles and play the role of world statesman than the six-day official trip to Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi and South Africa that ended with his return to London yesterday. The Gulf visits were largely about maintaining close relationships with political and business allies, spiced by the promise of defence orders and privatisation consultation fees from the Saudis. But the South African visit was the first by a British premier since Harold Macmillan's 'wind of change' speech in 1960, which signalled the start of the white government's 34-year international isolation. Mr Major's speech, worthy but dull, is unlikely to be remembered 34 years on. But it was well received by most shades of political opinion, and the visit was regarded on both sides as a modest success. In particular, British officials were pleased by clear indications that Mr Major's down-to-earth focus on concrete assistance impressed more than the high-flown but insubstantial rhetoric of President Mitterrand of France, the first western leader to visit after free elections ended white rule. The most striking aspect of the trip was the absence of the domestic fireworks that have followed Mr Major abroad on previous occasions. His trip to Japan and Malaysia a year ago, for example, was dominated by the question of his survival as prime minister amid acrimonious bickering between the party's pro and anti-Europeans. Aides say the prime minister has been buoyed by the success of the UK-Irish peace process and the improved economic outlook, which he believes will deliver two more years of solid growth before the next general election. Mr Major made the economic point strongly in Saudi Arabia, telling British businessmen that prospects were better than at any time since 1945. Talking to journalists in the garden of the high commissioner's residence in Pretoria, shortly before leaving for home, the prime minister avoided the temptation to confirm that he believed his premiership was at a turning point. 'No wise politician ever says that,' Mr Major explained cautiously. But the upbeat tone of the rest of his remarks told a different story, in tune with his relaxed and confident appearance. 'Politics is a series of mantraps,' he said. 'But there are a series of things we have been doing together for the last four years which are now beginning to come together. People are beginning to see the fruits.' Mr Major's advisers believe the first political rewards emerged in last week's ICM opinion poll for the Guardian, which put the Conservatives only 12 points behind Labour after adjusting for the factors that ICM believes caused inaccurate polling before the 1992 general election. Significantly, Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, also believes the Conservatives trail the opposition by far less than the 20 points to 30 points reported by many polling organisations during the past year. Mr Major thinks he will gain further support from a successful party conference in Bournemouth next month. There will be criticism - notably over the government's law and order record - but the prime minister's hold on power will not be seriously questioned for the first time in three years. Advisers say Mr Major knows there are still many problems ahead. The Northern Ireland peace process could break down, sparking renewed violence; the European issue could return to haunt the government when a bill to increase payments to the European Union is tabled later this year; the truce with the Tory rightwing could dissolve, as a brief spat with Baroness Thatcher over South African economic prospects demonstrated; and the July reshuffle has failed to end the impression of a tired and inept cabinet. But Mr Major's position is demonstrably stronger than a year ago. He looked confident in South Africa, especially with his jacket and tie off on the cricket field. Perhaps he should let his hair down more often.</p>

			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / UK Company News: GrandMet in move to expand dough activity GRAND Metropolitan, the food and drinks company, yesterday took the first step in a plan to extend to continental Europe the refrigerated dough business of Pillsbury, its US food subsidiary. GrandMet is acquiring the German refrigerated dough business of Kraft General Foods of the US. The business, which had sales last year of Pounds 12m, sells its products under the Knack &amp; Back brand and is market leader in Germany. The value of the deal was not disclosed, but GrandMet and KGF, a subsidiary of the Philip Morris tobacco group, said it would have no material impact on their shareholders' funds. Mr Peter Thompson, joint chief operating officer of GrandMet's food division, said the acquisition was an important step in the company's strategy to build a European refrigerated dough business. GrandMet is understood to be planning to enter other continental European markets, possibly through further acquisitions. Pillsbury is the largest producer of frozen dough in the US, with annual sales of about Dollars 1bn (Pounds 500m). GrandMet launched the product a year ago in Britain, where it is said to have more than 70 per cent of a small but growing market.</p>

			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GOVERNOR PROPOSES STIFFER PENALTIES FOR DRUG DEALERS  </P> <P> Worried that tough laws in other states are encouraging drug dealers to move  their operations to California, Gov. George Deukmejian called Saturday for even  stronger penalties here to combat drugs.  </P> <P> In a preview of his upcoming State of the State Address, Deukmejian proposed  sharply increasing prison sentences for large-scale drug pushers and the death  penalty for drug dealers who commit murder.  </P> <P> "I want California to be first in the nation in many fields, but I don't want  our state to be the No. 1 center of illegal drug trafficking," the governor  said in his weekly radio broadcast. "We must act quickly to make our anti-drug  laws the toughest in the nation."  </P> <P> In his speech, Deukmejian gave only a brief outline of his proposal. Donna  Lucas, a spokeswoman for the governor, said the plan would be fleshed out when  legislation is drafted and introduced in the Legislature.  </P> <P> In particular, the governor called for imposing a minimum penalty of 25 years  without possibility of parole on "large-scale importers of heroin and cocaine."  </P> <P> Currently, selling a large amount of cocaine or heroin in California could  result in a penalty as short as three years in prison, Deukmejian said. In  Florida, such a crime would be punished by a minimum of 15 years in prison, he  said.  </P> <P> Under Deukmejian's proposal, a 25-year prison sentence would be imposed on  convicted drug dealers who seek to sell more than 400 grams of cocaine in  California, Lucas said.  </P> <P> In addition, the governor said he would seek to authorize the death penalty  "for certain murders committed by large-scale drug pushers." A long-time  advocate of capital punishment, Deukmejian did not elaborate on what  circumstances would warrant the death penalty in drug cases.  </P> <P> Lucas said the governor's death penalty legislation would duplicate a federal  law enacted last year. Adopting a similar state law, she said, would make it  easier for prosecutors to win death sentences in California drug-related murder  cases.  </P></p>

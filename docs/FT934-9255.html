			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / NatPower downbeat on earnings NATIONAL Power, the UK's largest electricity generator, yesterday disappointed the market with a dividend increase at the bottom end of expectations and a downbeat trading statement. A 24 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 250m for the half-year to September 26, was helped by a Pounds 45m release from provisions following a favourable decision on pension equalisation by the European Court of Justice. Without this, the profit rise would have been just 2 per cent from 1992's Pounds 201m. Mr John Baker, chief executive, warned that the company's share of the electricity generation market could fall to below 30 per cent following a reduction during the half year from 41 per cent to 33 per cent. 'The reliability of earnings growth remains under pressure,' he said, but added that there would be real increases in the long term. Analysts had expected a relatively downbeat statement from the company. Nonetheless, shares fell by 9.5p to 402.5p. The profit improvement was achieved on a 21 per cent fall in turnover, from Pounds 1.97bn to Pounds 1.56bn. The result was helped by a further reduction in the company's workforce to 6,700 from 7,300. That compares with more than 17,000 at privatisation three years ago. The interim dividend goes up 14 per cent, from 3.3p to 3.75p. This is covered 3.3 times by earnings per share of 12.2p, against 11.5p. The company aims to reduce cover to about 2.5 times but will implement the change over two to three years. The results were the company's last before Professor Stephen Littlechild, electricity industry regulator, decides whether to refer National Power and its rival PowerGen to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Mr Baker said the chances of a referral were even, although the company did not consider there was any evidence to justify this. He expressed doubts about the viability of a third nuclear power station at Sizewell. 'I do not consider it an economic proposition as it has been put forward to us.' Work would start on the company's second combined cycle gas turbine power plant, at Didcot, Oxfordshire, early next year. The plant would be commissioned in 1997. The company was likely to build a third CCGT at Staythorpe, Nottinghamshire, by the end of the century. Mr Baker said annual output was expected to be some 95 terawatt hours, compared with 109 terawatt hours in 1992-93. Lex, Page 20; London SE, Page 44</p>

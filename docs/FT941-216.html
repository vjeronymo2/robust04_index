			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Russian deals fall short of Brown's hopes Mr Ron Brown, the US commerce secretary, yesterday announced a series of deals between US and Russian companies which fell short of his hopes - but which, he said, pointed the way to US investment greatly in excess of the present Dollars 1bn. His most significant breakthrough was in achieving a lifting of a 50 per cent tariff on aerospace products. This allowed the Russian private air company TransAero to import two Boeing 757s on a lease deal which it had previously threatened to cancel because of the imposition of the tariff on March 15. The company is also negotiating about the leasing of a further two Boeing 757s, but no agreement has been signed. Mr Brown said that, in talks with Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the Russian premier, he extracted a promise not just to lift the tariff but also not to impose tariffs retrospectively on deals already signed and to review all of the new tariffs imposed this month. President Boris Yeltsin has himself said that the tariff issue must be re-opened. However, he failed to have lifted an export tariff of Dollars 5 per barrel of oil. The tariff threatens to make many oil joint ventures between foreign and Russian companies unprofitable and jeopardises the conclusion of an agreement on the Sakhalin offshore reserves which a group of Western companies, including the US corporations of McDermott and Marathon, the British-Dutch Shell and the Japanese Mitsui, have been waiting to sign for two years. The commerce secretary said that Mr Chernomyrdin had promised only to 'review' the tariffs, and said he hoped the deal would be signed in April. He announced agreements signed by, among others, Westinghouse Electric to maintain nuclear power stations; the Cytran biotech company to build the first internationally certified laboratory and manufacturing facility; and the conversion of a defence plant into a packaging producer by Allen Associates. Mr Brown, who had a 45 minute meeting with Mr Yeltsin, said: 'I leave with a renewed sense of optimism about the future (of Russia).'</p>

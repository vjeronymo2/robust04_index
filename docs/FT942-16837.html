			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Israelis relive Holocaust fears For many Israelis yesterday, the annual remembrance of the 6m Jewish victims of the Nazi Holocaust had a special significance. Wednesday's killing of seven Jews and the threat by the extremist Islamic Hamas movement to step up 'real war' against Zionists made the fears of some more real. 'It is a day we really feel the Holocaust is not the past but the present, that it could be the destiny of this nation,' said Dr Ruth Firer, a specialist in the teaching of the Holocaust in Israeli schools. 'Emotionally, every time violent events against Jews happen like this, all our traumas and fears of survival come up.' In a Holocaust memorial speech on Wednesday, President Ezer Weizman honoured the victims of a suicide car-bomb in the northern Israeli town of Afula. 'Today, the eve of Holocaust and Heroism Remembrance Day, we paid a heavy price because we are Jews, for our desire to live peaceful and independent lives in the land of Israel. The historic cycle of blood continues.' For two minutes at 10am yesterday, Israel came to an eerie standstill. At the sound of sirens, drivers stopped their vehicles in the middle of the streets, switched off their engines and got out of their cars. Along the pavements Israelis halted, stood to attention and bowed their heads. Nearly half a century after the end of the second world war, Jews remembered the most psychologically powerful event in their history and the most important driving force behind the creation of the state of Israel in 1948. During the 24 hours' remembrance, government officials broke off peace talks with Palestinians in Cairo to attend memorial events back home. Bars and restaurants closed on Wednesday night. National and cable TV broadcast only Holocaust films and documentaries. For some Jews, the suffering of the Holocaust is a justification for the Israeli repression of the Palestinians. 'If we had not had the Holocaust we could not have thrown the Arabs out across the river to Jordan,' said Mr Ronnie Iloz, a shopkeeper. Others criticise the way right-wing politicians frequently exploit the Holocaust and compare the Arabs to the Nazis in rhetoric depicting Jews as victims surrounded by hostile forces. 'We have to be very careful not to let the Holocaust control our lives, because we may lose our ability to change, to take risks and go through the peace process,' said Dr Firer. 'We are now taking the biggest risk the Jewish nation has taken in modern times, but politicians use the Holocaust to terrify the people. We have to free ourselves from this trauma or we won't be able to take this risk and go to the future with Arabs, hoping the peace has a real chance.' Global awareness of the Holocaust was lifted by the film 'Schindler's List', which is playing to packed houses in Israel, and the opening last year of the Holocaust museum in Washington has also raised the debate about the way Jews see themselves. Mr Eric Silver, an Israeli journalist and author, says: 'The Holocaust gives a negative image of the Jew as a helpless victim and builds up Jewish paranoia.' The other question is whether the memories of Holocaust survivors are still strong enough to be relevant. The recent release of Mr John Demjanjuk, wrongly identified by several survivors as Ivan the Terrible of the Treblinka death camp, raised calls in Israel to forget the past and may have signalled the effective end of Nazi hunting.</p>

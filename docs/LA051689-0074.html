			<p><P> May 16, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> AT GRANT HIGH;  </P> <P> DROP IN ATTENDANCE HELPS ADMINISTRATORS KEEP SCHOOL GOING  </P> <P> By 6:40 a.m. Monday, tension had squeezed out nearly all of Robert Collins'  normal jocularity.  </P> <P> Collins, principal of the 3,200-student Grant High School in Van Nuys, stood at  the school's Oxnard Street entrance with his walkie-talkie in hand, scowling,  breathing deeply and appearing ready for anything from gang trouble to  picket-line violence.  </P> <P> "You can't block traffic, you know that," he said to the striking teachers  milling about. Then, a bit friendlier: "I hope this is the only day you guys  have to be out here."  </P> <P> Collins and his team of administrators had crafted what he called "a complete  reorganization of the entire school" in preparation for Monday's strike,  juggling classroom assignments, schedules and supervision duties to allow the  school's operation without most of its 132 teachers.  </P> <P> But, until students and substitutes began arriving at about 7:15 a.m., no one  knew whether it was going to work.  </P> <P> Rumors of impending gang violence had circulated all day Friday, adding to the  tension. Collins had dismissed the rumors. Early Monday, however, the unknown  still loomed. "You can discount rumors, but you never know," he said.  </P> <P> Collins nervously radioed the front office, checking on the number of  substitutes. "If I get about a dozen substitute teachers, we can be pretty  secure," he said. "Less than that and we can't run the program we want to run."  </P> <P> Only 10 substitutes arrived to work, and 15 of Grant's teachers crossed the  picket line. But it didn't matter much because only 1,400 students, far fewer  than Collins had anticipated, showed up.  </P> <P> When the 8 a.m. class bell rang, Collins and Joe Walker, the assistant  principal, began sweeping through the campus, locking doors and hustling  confused stragglers in the direction of their classes. Students whose teachers  did not show were sent to large gatherings in the school's two gymnasiums or an  auditorium.  </P> <P> In the gyms and the auditorium, little of substance was going on, as  administrators and substitute and regular teachers struggled for control. One  student foursome dealt a hand of cards. Paper airplanes flew. Students shot  basketballs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Return to Order  </P> <P> By second period, a meager amount of instruction was occurring. A biology  teacher conducted a lecture on organs and cells. A substitute art teacher gave  out an assignment on shapes. Another substitute explained the rules regarding  grades.  </P> <P> "This was a waste of time," said senior Adam Finer, 17, as he exited the campus  with a group of students who said they were bored by the lack of instruction.  "They spent half the time reading the rules to us, as if we can't read  ourselves."  </P> <P> Still, students were generally cooperative. A few gang members were warned to  leave campus, but by the beginning of third period the 39-acre campus appeared  entirely calm.  </P> <P> And Collins, the tension of the early morning having dissolved, was joking,  exulting even, and saying that starting today real instruction and learning  would begin again. "Now our plan will work perfectly, because the number of  students is low," he said.  </P> <P> Joe Walker sounded a note of confidence. "The longer this goes on, the better  we get at it," he said.  </P></p>

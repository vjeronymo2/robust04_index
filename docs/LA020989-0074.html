			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: CERRITOS;  </P> <P> FIRM RAIDED IN SEARCH FOR ILLEGAL SEWER DISCHARGES  </P> <P> A Cerritos firm has been prohibited from discharging waste water into the sewer  system until it meets the environmental standards required by the Sanitation  Districts of Los Angeles County.  </P> <P> The firm, Transducers Inc., was raided Monday by agents from the sanitation  districts, the county district attorney's office and the county Health  Department. They carried search warrants in order to gather evidence that the  firm illegally discharged hazardous heavy metals into the sewer system, said  Margaret Nellor, sanitation districts spokeswoman.  </P> <P> Peter Perino, president of the firm, was unavailable for comment, his secretary  Mercy Gingrich said. She confirmed that there was a "visit" from sanitation  agents.  </P> <P> The district attorney is reviewing evidence, Nellor said, to determine if  criminal charges will be filed against Transducers, 17502 Fabrica Way. It makes  instruments for weights and measures, Nellor said. The firm cannot discharge  waste water, she said, until sanitation officials are satisfied that it has  been properly treated to eliminate hazardous materials.  </P></p>

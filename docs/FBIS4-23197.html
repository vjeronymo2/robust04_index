			<p>BFN     [Text] Kigali, May 30 (AFP) -- Rwandan rebel and army  commanders agreed Monday [30 May] to allow the evacuation of  civilians and to resume UN-brokered ceasefire talks on Thursday.    The accord was announced by the commanders after their first  face-to-face meeting at the Amahoro Hotel.    United Nations troops meanwhile evacuated hundreds of  civilians trapped for weeks behind the battlelines to safe  areas, after an early morning delay caused by fierce artillery  duels and difficulties in obtaining guarantees of security from  both sides, UN officials said.    Mainly Hutu government supporters were driven in white UN  trucks from the Amahoro stadium, in rebel-held territory, to  government-controlled areas south of the embattled capital  Kigali.</p>

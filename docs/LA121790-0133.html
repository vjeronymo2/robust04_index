			<p><P> December 17, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> STARS DONE IN BY KIDS' PLAY AT BOX OFFICE;  </P> <P> MOVIES: "HOME ALONE," "LOOK WHO'S TALKING TOO" STEAL THE THUNDER AS REDFORD AND  CHER RETURN TO THE SCREEN WITH DISAPPOINTING DRAWS.  </P> <P> Kid stars dramatically upstaged superstars Robert Redford and Cher at the  weekend box office, as a trio of youth-oriented titles -- led by the runaway  hit, "Home Alone" -- topped the charts with combined ticket sales of more than  $26 million.  </P> <P> "Mermaids" -- the first film from Cher since her Academy Award-winning  performance in "Moonstruck" in 1987 -- had opening weekend ticket sales of  about $3.5 million on 918 screens, for a weak per-screen average of $3,812 and  seventh place.  </P> <P> "Havana," which marks the seventh teaming of Redford and director Sydney  Pollack -- following the 1985 Oscar winner, "Out of Africa" -- had opening  weekend receipts of about $2.2 million on 826 screens for a disappointing  per-screen average of $2,663 and ninth place.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, first place again went to 20th Century-Fox's family comedy "Home  Alone." Starring Macaulay Culkin as a plucky 8-year-old who must defend the  homestead when he's left home alone for the holidays, the film earned about  $11.9 million on 2,017 screens for a per-screen average of $5,899. After five  weeks' release, it is poised to surpass the $100-million mark.  </P> <P> In second place, with receipts of about $8 million, was Tri-Star Pictures'  sequel to last year's fall sleeper, "Look Who's Talking Too." About a trio of  wise-cracking toddlers -- who "speak" via voice-overs by Bruce Willis, Roseanne  Barr and Damon Wayans -- the film opened at 1,576 theaters, where it averaged  $5,899 per screen.  </P> <P> Fox's comedy-drama "Edward Scissorhands" -- directed by Tim Burton  ("Beetlejuice," "Batman") and starring Johnny Depp as an extraordinary young  man with scissors for hands -- was third with ticket sales of about $6.2  million. In its first week of wide release on 1,023 screens, the film had a  per-screen average of $6,060.  </P> <P> Elsewhere among the weekend's top 10:  </P> <P> "Dances With Wolves" (Orion Pictures) was fourth with $4.5 million; "Misery"  (Columbia Pictures), fifth, $4.1 million; "The Rookie" (Warner Bros.), sixth,  $3.5 million; "Three Men and a Little Lady" (Buena Vista), eighth, $2.7  million; "Predator II" (Fox), 10th, $1 million.  </P> <P> Hollywood's seasonal offerings continue this week, with the opening of 10  additional titles, led by the Arnold Schwarzenegger comedy, "Kindergarten Cop"  (opening Friday) and the Sean Connery-Michelle Pfeiffer romantic thriller "The  Russia House" (opening Wednesday).  </P></p>

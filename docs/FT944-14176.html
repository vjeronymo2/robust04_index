			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Malta paralysed by strike A one-day national strike ordered by Malta's 43,000-strong General Workers' Union (GWU) yesterday paralysed most of the island, bringing public transport, international flights, banks, dockyards, many municipality services and several hotels and factories to a halt. Most shops also remained closed. The strike was ordered in protest at the planned introduction of value added tax next January. Mr Eddie Fenech Adami, the Nationalist prime minister, pushed the measure through parliament in July and has shown no readiness to modify the January date. Buoyed by yesterday's successful stoppage, Mr Anglu Fenech, GWU secretary, said his union clearly enjoyed national backing in its opposition to VAT, which it claims will increase the island's cost of living and erode wages. The strike was backed by the opposition Labour party and the general retailers' and traders' union.</p>

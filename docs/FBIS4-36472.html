			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "No Explanation"] </F>   [Text] Yesterday the foreign minister raged and fumed, but  failed to convince. The deeper he sank, the more his colleagues  deserted him: Shahal denied responsibility, Aloni doubted the  merit of his explanation, and the prime minister's bureau was  conspicuously silent. The resulting -- and well-founded --  impression was that the publicized letter was not all there was.  That there was more. And if that was not enough, a close  perusal of the publicized text of the letter -- which was  supposed to have been written by experienced diplomats -- made  one wonder about its grave inconsistencies.    The government's credibility plummeted, and the Jerusalem  issue acquired a more critical edge. How valid are the prime  minister's pronouncements about "united Jerusalem, Israel's  eternal capital," when the foreign minister refers to eastern  Jerusalem (not even "East Jerusalem") as a distinct unit?    The angry Peres offered no convincing explanations, and  certainly no solutions. The grave problems created by his  letter, by 'Arafat's interpretation of the letter, and by the  circumstances surrounding its nonpublication and publication can  be at least partially attenuated by immediate, categorical  action, such as a bill banning PLO political activities in  Jerusalem and prohibiting the use of PLO emblems in the city.  Yet time is the most crucial factor in this matter. They can  do it with utmost speed, if they so wish.</p>

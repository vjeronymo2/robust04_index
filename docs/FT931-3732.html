			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / UK Company News: London Electricity quits retailing LONDON Electricity yesterday became the first of the privatised electricity companies to withdraw completely from retailing. It announced a management buy-out of part of its loss-making retail business and closure of the rest. The Pounds 6m buy-out, headed by Mr Clive Vlotman, London Electricity's retail operations controller, will cover 66 of the company's 96 retail units  -19 stores and 47 retailing concessions granted to Debenhams, the high street retailer. Capita Corporate Finance is providing the funding. Of the remaining stores, 17 will close and 13 will be converted to customer service centres, to add to the 18 centres already operating. London Electricity's 1992-93 results will show an exceptional charge of about Pounds 20m to cover the cost of the withdrawal, including a write-off of fixed assets and a discount to the MBO for existing stock. In 1991-92 the retail business incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 11m on turnover of Pounds 33m. Interim results for this year included a Pounds 4m pre-tax loss on retailing before pre-tax profits of Pounds 17.3m on all activities.</p>

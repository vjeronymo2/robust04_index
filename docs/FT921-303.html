			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Survey of Republic of Slovenia (3): Independence costs - Judy Dempsey examines the economy SLOVENIA is in recession. But unlike the other former communist countries of eastern Europe which have been plunged into recession because of the radical transformation of their economies, the reasons for the recession in Slovenia are different. The political crises in the former Yugoslavia have greatly contributed to the republic's current economic circumstances. Traditionally, Slovenia's economy was more developed than those of the other five republics. It had the highest standard of living and consistently higher growth in industrial production and GDP. But this small republic of 2m people was in no position, either politically or economically, to insulate itself from the economic crisis which plagued the entire federation throughout the 1980s. In the mid-1980s, the Yugoslav economy was stagnating. Industrial production was falling by 15 per cent a year, unemployment had reached 19.8 per cent by the end of 1990; the average inflation rate had increased from 20 per cent between 1974 and 1980 to 2,600 per cent in 1989; real wages had fallen to two-thirds of those in 1979. Inter-republic differences had also been increased. The gap in GDP between Slovenia and the southern province of Kosovo widened from 5:1 in 1955 to 7:1 in 1988. Attempts to introduce market reforms by Mr Ante Markovic, the former federal prime minister, came too late to avert the violent political and economic disintegration of the federation. In a recent paper*, Mr Jose Mencinger, a professor at the University of Ljubljana, argued: 'The political developments deprived Yugoslavia of all systemic advantages from a swift transition (to the market economy). 'The differences between the 'west' and the 'east' (among the republics of Yugoslavia) became an unsurmountable barrier for the implementation of systemic changes, and for a sound economic policy. In such circumstances, the prices of 'secession' (by Slovenia) became lower than the economic and social costs of sharing the Yugoslav chaos.' Few economists and government officials in Slovenia have doubts about the economic costs of independence. About 30 per cent of the republic's exports were earmarked for the former Yugoslavia, and about 28 per cent of its imports were from the other republics. But the political disputes and economic blockades between the republics, and the war in neighbouring Croatia, the breakdown of the Yugoslav federation's transport and distribution networks, together with the introduction of new currencies in the republics, have reinforced the view among Slovene economists that its government must introduce an economic strategy. The economists want this strategy to focus on introducing privatisation, attracting foreign investment through new legislation and incentives, finding and targeting new, hard currency export markets, and normalising its economic relations with the former republics of Yugoslavia. Parallel to adopting a national strategy, economists want the government to focus more sharply on addressing the republic's macroeconomic problems. Since 1985, industrial output in Slovenia has been declining by about 10 per cent and gross fixed investments have been reduced by more than 30 per cent. In the first nine months of 1991, the downward trend continued, with manufacturing output falling by 11 per cent compared with the same period in 1990. Attempts by the government to reverse these trends have not been entirely successful. Mr Marko Kranjec, the vice-governor of Slovenia's central bank, says the government has been postponing introduction of a stabilisation programme since the beginning of 1991. As a result, when Slovenia declared its independence on June 26, 1991, inflation was running at 12 per cent a month, unemployment was rising above 10 per cent of the labour force, the low level of foreign exchange reserves was preventing the purchase of imports, and enterprises were faced with substantial arrears. These economic trends dampened the euphoria of independence. That was when the central bank stepped in. Under legislation passed last June, the Bank of Slovenia, or central bank, was made completely independent of the government. Mr Franc Arhar, head of the central bank, and his colleagues set about introducing a tight monetary policy, primarily aimed at curbing inflation and stimulating growth. The first measures undertaken by the bank was the introduction of a new monetary unit called the Slovene Tolar (SLT). For technical reasons, the conversion rate between the Tolar and the Yugoslav dinar, the federation currency, was initially fixed at one for one. A maximum amount of SLT27,000 per person was allowed so as to insulate the new monetary system from the rest of Yugoslavia and to reduce the amount of Yugoslav dinars from other part of Yugoslavia being converted into Tolars. All existing notes and coins were exchanged within 27 hours. Once the new currency was introduced, the central bank set about wiping out excess liquidity from the banks by employing a variety of instruments. Mr Kranjec explained how the central bank stopped the policy of selective lending to priority sectors; reduced the minimum reserve requirements from 20 per cent to 7 per cent of demand deposits; revoked the automatic availability of re-discount facilities to commercial banks; introduced a fixed re-discount rate of 25 per cent per annum; and imposed a credit freeze from October 8 to October 31. The central bank then examined how the republic's foreign exchange reserves could be boosted. It devalued the Tolar by 60 per cent, or SLT32 to DM1. It then set about allowing the market to adjust the exchange rate. Transactions were liberalised and 70 per cent of export earnings could be used freely by exporters, but within two days, otherwise enterprises would have to sell the foreign exchange on the spot market to other enterprises or banks. Some 30 per cent of all foreign exchange revenues had to be submitted to the central bank for servicing the external debt, as well as for payment for items such as oil and medicine. The central's banks persistence in adhering to a tight monetary policy has had a positive affect on the economy. The liquidity of the banking system has been reduced by 60 per cent and foreign exchange reserves have increased by 30 per cent to Dollars 250m. But the monthly inflation rate remains erratic. In October, it was reduced to 5 per cent, but the following month it accelerated to 17 per cent a month. Mr Kranjec and other economists argue that the central bank's success in implementing its tight monetary policy must be actively supported by the government. 'We need support from the government, but we are not receiving it,' said Mr Kranjec. For example, the central bank wants greater, but temporary, restrictions on price increases, and a tariff policy. At the moment, various lobbies in the government tend to favour continuing monopolies in the food, food processing, and utilities sector over competition. These lobbies include the agrarian farmers sector, which is politically close to the Christian Democrats, largest party in the Demos coalition and which is led by Mr Lozje Peterle, prime minister. 'Anti-monopoly laws and competition policy must be introduced to curb this huge monopolistic system which can raise prices and push up inflation,' argued Mr Kranjec. The government is slowly coming round to supporting the central bank's monetary policy. The jump in inflation last November finally persuaded the cabinet to freeze salaries for six months. The central bank would have even more clout vis-a-vis the government in the successful implementation of its monetary policy if Slovenia was admitted to the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. 'We will support the central bank's tough monetary policy,' said Mr Andrej Ocvirk, deputy prime minister. 'But it will take time to come out of the recession. The next few years will not be easy for us,' he added. * 'Decentralised versus centralised privatisation: The Case of Slovenia.' International Symposium on Privatisation. Bled, Slovenia.

			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / City businesses tighten security to combat IRA CITY BUSINESSES have been tightening security and emergency planning arrangements following the threat of renewed terrorist action from the IRA. Mr Ian Johnson, managing director of IJA Group, a risk and security management consultancy, said his company was one of several which had received calls from existing and potential clients following the explosion of the bomb in the City last Friday evening. He said that in the short term many companies were employing extra guards to raise the visibility of security, partly as a deterrent and partly to restore staff confidence. Mr Johnson said: 'It happened after the firebombs at Christmas, and with the Easter holiday coming up companies are ensuring they are as secure as possible. The bomb has concentrated senior managers' minds on disaster planning.' Security guards outside the City office complex which houses Chase Manhattan, the US investment bank, and Slaughter &amp; May, the solicitors, were at work yesterday noting the number plates of cars parked outside. Mr Owen Kelly, City of London police commissioner, appealed to companies yesterday which had security cameras or closed circuit televisions to ensure they were in good working order. Most businesses are reluctant to discuss security arrangements in any detail. National Westminster Bank revealed that it had special anti-shatter film on the windows in its tower before the blast last week. 'It worked very well in the circumstances on Friday,' a spokesman said. 'Most of the panes just fractured, but stayed in place, which lessened the damage and prevented glass blowing in or falling out on to the street.' Touche Ross, the accountancy firm, said it had pre-empted Friday's bombing by chance, and was already planning to adopt tighter security measures. These involve all members of staff having to show a security pass to get into the building, and visitors being issued with passes only after being positively identified by a member of staff. Video cameras protect the entrances, and guards also carry out patrols. Wine bars are also paying more attention to security. Balls Brothers, a chain with a dozen branches around the City, has not given staff specific advice but the manager of one branch said he was 'very vigilant about left parcels and briefcases'. Posters warning customers to keep their belongings to hand in case of theft help keep down the number of false alarms. The exposure of the UK's leading insurers to loss from the bomb damage will be limited to possibly less than Pounds 150m, it emerged yesterday. The bulk of the loss  - which with claims from both property damage and business interruption could amount to up to Pounds 1bn  - will be met by reinsurers in London and overseas.

			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / International Company News: Minister justifies the selection of Bouygues A consortium led by Bouygues was selected as the winning candidate for France's third mobile telephones network because the construction group had been most persistent in seeking to enter the market, Mr Gerard Longuet, minister for industry, post and telecommunications, said yesterday. Mr Longuet said Alcatel Alsthom, the closest rival in the contest, was disadvantaged by it being an important supplier to France Telecom, which operates one of the existing mobile telecommunications networks. 'Being already the biggest supplier it could not become the biggest competitor,' he said. His comments were part of an attempt to justify the process on which the decision was reached. Unlike in some other countries, the licence award was not based on cash offers but on the presentation of business plans, including technical, commercial and investment proposals. Mr Longuet said the report by the managing director of the post and telecoms authority, which evaluated the bids from Bouygues, Alcatel and Lyonnaise des Eaux, the utilities group which was the third contender, would be published soon. The selection process was sensitive because of the media and political influence of the three competitors. Some observers claimed that Bouygues' position as controlling shareholder in TF1, the national television network, had given it an advantage with presidential elections due by mid-1995. 'It is a far from negligible asset in a pre-election period,' said Liberation, the daily newspaper. The rival groups, however, also wield influence. Alcatel owns two of France's leading weekly news magazines, Le Point and L'Express, while Mr Jerome Monod, chairman of Lyonnaise des Eaux, is a former aide to Mr Jacques Chirac, leader of the Gaullist RPR party, and a rival of Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, for the conservative candidacy in the presidential elections. The sensitivity of the decision prompted delays in announcing the winner and a demand for more information by Mr Balladur. Bouygues yesterday denied it had made any changes to its proposals. Alcatel said yesterday it respected the decision and planned to use its resources for similar developments outside of France. Lyonnaise des Eaux said it would also continue with its development in the telecommunications sector.</p>

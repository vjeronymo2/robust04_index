			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 64. While there have been times when the U.S. government has promoted particular standards, industry adoption of voluntary standards, working with government officials, is now the norm. Various commenters have argued that either approach can be too slow given the fast pace of change in the industry. In addition, some argue that the industry standard-setting process is costly and requires large amounts of employee time, which creates hardships for smaller companies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 65. How should standards develop for the NII? Do standards affect the ability to innovate? How can standards be developed that are flexible and adaptable enough to meet user needs at affordable costs? If voluntary, industry-set standards are the favored approach, what procedures should be followed in establishing standards, and what fora should be used? What role, if any, should the government play? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 66. Competition is one of several means of ensuring that innovation and the provision of information and transport services will flourish on the NII. At the same time, there is a recognized need for government intervention in the case of market failures, for example, to protect new entrants from the market power of incumbent operators when necessary. Will greater competition in information and transport markets alone be sufficient to achieve open access goals? If not, what other actions are necessary? What regulations or policies need to be in place to guarantee reasonable and nondiscriminatory interconnection and reasonable cost-based pricing and tariffs for the NII? What technical or regulatory barriers must be overcome? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VII.

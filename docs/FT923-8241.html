			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / Japanese stock buyers continue to stay away: Emiko Terazono looks at reasons for the disillusionment of the country's retail investors SALES CLERKS at the Nomura Securities branch in Ginza, the central shopping and business centre of Tokyo, sit around idly behind empty counters. They fail to react to the flashing price board, indicating another fall of the Nikkei stock index. Other than an occasional pedestrian peering into check share prices, the branch is quiet, and the second floor of the branch, designated for 'individual investment consulting', is also deserted. With the Nikkei's weakness well into its third consecutive year, Japan's individual investors have reacted coolly to the recent plunge on the Tokyo stock market. 'I don't want to have anything to do with stocks,' says Mrs Kyoko Aoyama, a housewife living in Tokyo, who purchased a total Y7m (Pounds 28,800) worth of stocks in the late 1980s. 'I bought about seven issues, and wanted to use the profits for my son's university tuition, but now I've lost about a third of it. Looking at share prices just irritates me.' Mrs Aoyama is only one of Japan's disillusioned retail investors who have turned away from the stock market. Earlier this year, brokers tried to woo individuals back into the stock market again with advertising campaigns and investment seminars. Other brokers have also tried to restore the fashionable image of stock investments by using comic characters in television adverts. Brokers believe that with institutional and foreign investors discouraged from buying, the return of the private investor is essential for a stock market recovery. 'In the past, active buying by individuals has signaled a rebound in share prices,' says Daiwa Securities. But individuals have been unmoved by Japanese securities houses' efforts to rebuild investor confidence, which was shattered by last year's spate of stock scandals. Risk-wary Japanese individual investors have shunned stocks for fixed-income investments. Last month, stock investment funds saw Y326.4bn in cancellations and redemptions, which exceeded new fund establishments in the 17th consecutive monthly net outflow. In contrast, the money management fund - a new bond and money market fund offered to the private investor - has attracted Y3,173bn since its debut last May, and postal savings, which offer higher rates than normal bank deposits, rose 16 per cent from last March, to Y158,000bn at the end of June. The low dividend yield of the market has also discouraged investors. Japanese investors have generally focused on share price rather than dividend yield, but with the stock market off 60 per cent from its peak, the present yield on the Tokyo stock market, around 1 per cent, fails to be attractive. Financial authorities have become increasingly worried over the lack of individual response. Mr Tadashi Ogawa, the newly appointed director of the Finance Ministry's securities bureau, called for changes in the securities industry to benefit the retail investor. The Tokyo Stock Exchange wants to increase availability of shares to individuals, and is recommending a reduction in the minimum investment unit from 1,000 shares to 100. However, such measures are unlikely to convince individuals carrying heavy losses on their stock portfolios. Mr Hideo Ichikawa, a 36-year-old Tokyo office worker who borrowed Y5m to purchase stocks for the first time in 1989, says he is repaying the interest on his loans by borrowing more money with his credit card. 'I've had enough. Working hard for a salary is the best way to make money.'</p>

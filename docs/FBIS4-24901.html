			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sun Yanzhao (1327 1693 2507) and reporter Yan Jinjiu </F> (7051 6855 0036): "Central Military Commission Vice Chairman  Zhang Zhen Stresses Key to Training Reform Lies in Improvement  of Cadre Quality"]    [Text] Zhengzhou, 21 May (JIEFANGJUN BAO)--Use as guidance  Mao Zedong's military thinking and Deng Xiaoping's ideas on army  building in the new period, firmly grasp the key of improving  the quality of the contingent of cadres, deepen reform of  military training, comprehensively satisfy the general demands  put forward in the "five points" by Chairman Jiang of the  Military Commission, and better perform the fundamental duties  of the armed forces. This is what General Zhang Zhen, vice  chairman of the Central Military Commission, stressed while  conducting investigations and studies of units and academies of  the armed forces garrisoned in Henan.    From 2 to 21 May, Vice Chairman Zhang Zhen, making light of  hardships, went deep into the leading organs, academies, and  training grounds of companies of the armed forces garrisoned in  Henan and carried out extensive investigations and studies on  questions centering on how to improve the quality of the  contingent of cadres and how to deepen reform of military  training. After fully affirming the achievements in training  reform made by the units he visited, he pointed out: To do a  good job in training reform, we must use as guidance Mao  Zedong's military thinking and Deng Xiaoping's ideas on army  building during the new period. Mao Zedong's military thinking  has summed up the experience of how our poorly equipped armed  forces defeated their much better equipped enemy over several  decades and has crystalized the collective wisdom of the older  generation of proletarian revolutionaries. Deng Xiaoping's  ideas on army building in the new period have inherited and  developed Mao Zedong's military thinking and are the theoretical  basis for guiding the building and reform of the armed forces.  So long as we seriously study them and arm our brains with  them, we will be able to make new breakthroughs in training  reform.    In the course of conducing investigations and studies, Vice  Chairman Zhang Zhen stressed from a strategic plane the extreme  importance of having our eyes on the future, giving special  attention to properly grasping the training of cadres, and  training comprehensively qualified personnel in deepening  training reform, and increasing the combat power of the armed  forces. He said: In training cadres, we should focus on  improving quality in four aspects. The first is to improve  political quality. Study of the theory of building socialism  with Chinese characteristics and education on world outlook  should be regarded as basic lessons so that our cadres will  really heed what the party says and will have lofty communist  ideals. The second is to improve the military quality. They  should be proficient in tactics and strategies and should master  the skills of training the armed forces in times of peace and  the skills of directing battles in times of war. The third is  to improve the quality of science and culture. A modern war is  fought under conditions of high technology. Without knowledge  of science and culture, it is difficult to study and control a  war. Besides, at a time when socialist modernization is  developing rapidly, it will be very difficult for cadres  transferred from the armed forces to adapt themselves to  civilian posts if they do not have knowledge of science and  culture. The fourth is to improve the quality of management.  Importance should be attached to training cadres' about the  actual ability to lead troops so that they can constantly  improve the level of management in the armed forces.    Vice Chairman Zhang showed great concern for building  academies. On his way, he cordially visited teaching staff at  all of the academies; asked in detail about ideology, studies,  and the lives of the students; and discussed with them how to  further strengthen the building of academies. He said: We  should mainly depend on academies in training cadres. Training  given in academies should enable the fine traditions of the  armed forces to strike roots in the brains of the students, to  develop in the armed forces, and to maintain them there forever.  We should strive to narrow the gap between training in the  academies and the needs of the armed forces and should earnestly  build academies into important bases for training cadres.    At present, many comrades have never taken part in a war. It  is difficult to master the real skills of commanding war  operations through exercises and maneuvers based on the  imagination. How should this problem be solved? Vice Chairman  Zhang said: The best way is to study examples of battles fought  by our armed forces. We should, through such studies, increase  our understanding of Mao Zedong's military thinking, solve the  problem of how cadres without experience of war can acquire  skills in fighting battles, and solve the problem of  establishing confidence to darer to fight and to win. In  studying examples of battles, we should first study examples of  battles fought by our own armed forces before we study those  fought by other armed forces, including examples of battles  fought by foreign armed forces. On the basis of this, we should  study new measures to cope with a modern war fought under  changed and developed conditions.    Making light of rugged mountain paths and a high temperature  of 34 degrees centigrade, Vice Chairman Zhang stooped and  entered tents as hot as food steamers to cordially visit  soldiers of units which were garrisoning and carrying out  exercises in the open country. He told leaders present that  they should provide good food for the fighters because  conditions of garrisoning and carrying out exercises in open  country were very tough. He also looked with great interest at  the newly upgraded training equipment used by the armed forces  and their academies. He repeatedly emphasized: The objective  of carrying out reform of training must be clear and we should  not practice formalism. We should properly integrate men with  weapons and should strive to increase the actual effects of  training.    At the end of his investigations and studies, Vice Chairman  Zhang also made an important speech on deepening study of Volume  3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and  unswervingly upholding the party's basic line for 100 years, on  implementing the "Program for Building Grass-Roots Army Units"  in order to comprehensively strengthen the building of  grass-roots army units, on upholding the principle of supporting  militia activities with production and doing both production and  militia duties and making great efforts to promote the building  of militia and reserve forces, and on further improving  leadership style and properly carrying out work in various  aspects.</p>

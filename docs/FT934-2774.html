			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Finance and the Family: Losers to get compensation Investors who lost money because of unauthorised investment in property by the Lancashire &amp; Yorkshire friendly society must be compensated, the High Court ruled this week. The 39,000 policyholders had put money in the society's Capital Secure fund, believing it was safely invested in cash deposits and gilts. In fact, the fund invested Pounds 6.8m in a hotel development near Rotherham late in the 1980s. The hotel is now valued at about Pounds 2m and is up for sale. Another 7,000 policyholders, who were expecting a decision on whether their lump sum policies qualified for tax-exempt status, will have to wait pending renewed talks between the society and the Inland Revenue. To qualify for tax exemption, the policy normally must be funded by regular premiums. Those eligible for compensation still face a long wait. John Ramsden, who became chairman of L&amp;Y in 1990 after the hotel was bought, said he hoped that if the society was able to sell the hotel and get tax exemption for the disputed policies, it would be able to pay out the compensation by May or June. Anticipating the court ruling, L&amp;Y imposed a 12 per cent levy on policyholders in August for a compensation fund. The amount raised is Pounds 10.1m but the society estimates its maximum liability at Pounds 8.3m, a figure which includes the 7,000 lump sum policyholders; the compensation bill could be reduced if the policies finally are deemed tax-exempt. Surplus money from the compensation fund will be returned to members' funds although, in a recent letter to them, Ramsden warned that those who leave the society will not be eligible to receive it. He advised those whose policies are due to mature to leave their money with L&amp;Y until compensation is paid and it is clear how much can be returned. Ramsden added: 'The society's policyholders have a right to be annoyed at the past but we are doing all we can to put things right.' He is considering legal action against L&amp;Y's advisers as well as committee members when the decision to invest in property was taken. It is hard to quantify the loss to policyholders until the society sells the hotel. When it has, compensation to those in the Capital Secure fund will be based on the difference between their policy value and what the fund should have been worth if the money had been left to grow at commercial rates of interest. Ramsden said he very much regretted that some members 'will be worse off as a result of the matters which led to the court proceedings.' These are policyholders who have had to pay the levy but are not eligible to compensation. Members will vote on the future of the society at its annual general meeting in the spring.</p>

			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Now for staggered vesting - The newest slant in private pensions THE LATEST craze in private pensions is staggered vesting, a complex and costly substitute for the simple purchase of an annuity to provide retirement income. Like most successful pension marketing campaigns, this is based on a concept that offers genuine opportunities to a minority of investors - provided the right fund management and ongoing expert advice is secured. Staggered vesting, or phased retirement, involves taking benefits in stages rather than all at once. But investment regulators are worried that salesmen and independent advisers are jumping on the bandwagon and marketing the concept inappropriately to secure commission payments of up to five times those available on a one-off annuity purchase. To appreciate the opportunities and risks associated with staggered vesting, it is necessary to understand the various pension options available at retirement. Employees in company schemes generally receive a pension linked to their final salary, plus a tax-free lump sum. Those in group or individual money purchase schemes - where the value of the pension depends on investment returns - can take a tax-free cash lump sum usually worth 25 per cent of their fund. The residual fund must be used to buy an annuity from a life office. Annuities come in various guises but, in return for a lump-sum investment, the majority guarantees to pay a fixed income until the person taking out the annuity dies. Two main problems associated with annuities have led to the development of phased retirement and staggered vesting. First, once you have paid your lump sum, it is gone for good - even if you die the following day. Most providers now offer annuities that return part of the fund if you die within five years, but this option is secured at the expense of a lower annuity rate. The second problem is flexibility. Once you have agreed the benefits - for example, a fixed annuity, annual increases of 5 per cent and/or spouse's pension - you cannot change your mind. Staggered vesting - and, to a lesser extent, phased retirement - attempts to overcome these problems. With phased retirement, the entire fund is not used to buy a single annuity. Instead, investors can purchase, say, three separate annuities at ages 60, 65 and 70. This allows those who want to continue working part-time to live off a combination of reduced earned income and a proportion of pension income. In addition, the residual fund left in the pension plan may continue to benefit from investment growth. And buying annuities at a later date will offer better value since rates are based on life expectancy, among other factors. Annuity rates can and do fall, depending on the underlying rate of inflation. Staggered vesting is the hot-house version of phased retirement - a delicate plant that needs careful nurture and is vulnerable to market forces. Under it, the one-off annuity purchase is replaced by a series of annual transactions. Each year, part of the pension fund is used to provide an element of tax-free cash and a small annuity, so allowing people to assess income needs annually. This requirement is met by the combination of tax-free cash, the annuity purchased with the current year's draw-down of funds, plus annuities in force from previous years. Clearly, however, since the tax-free cash is to form part of annual income, the large lump sums usually available at retirement will not be an option. As with phased retirement, the fund that remains invested can benefit from continued growth. The residual fund also provides a high level of continued life assurance since, provided the pension plan is written under trust, the fund is passed on free of inheritance tax to your beneficiaries if you die. Moreover, since annuity rates improve as your life expectancy decreases, the amount you need to encash each year should in theory decrease in inverse proportion to your age. But because of the complexity and the cost of the arrangement, staggered vesting is not considered suitable for those with less than Pounds 100,000 to invest and, ideally, they should have another source of retirement income because of the higher risks involved. Viewed in isolation the concept is extremely imaginative but pension regulators are concerned that staggered vesting offers providers and intermediaries a back entrance to the lucrative and controversial transfer market. Staggered vesting can be carried out only via a unit- linked, segmented personal pension. Typically, the pension must be split into segments of Pounds 1,000 so that, each year, the appropriate proportion of the fund can be drawn down to provide the necessary income. Under a personal pension, it is possible to draw the pension at any time between the age of 50 and 75. Personal pensions have been around only since 1988, so most investors coming up to retirement are likely to have a retirement annuity contract (the precursor to the personal pension), an executive pension plan, or some form of occupational scheme. The first step towards staggered vesting then is to transfer the benefits built up under existing arrangements to a personal plan. And therein lies the rub. On a single annuity purchase, providers tend to pay the intermediary between 1-1.5 per cent of the fund's value. Transfers, however, are classed as single premium business and, as such, pay commission of around 5.2 per cent. Given the target market for this product of individuals with funds worth Pounds 100,000, the difference for the intermediary lies between earning around Pounds 1,000 and Pounds 5,000. In addition to the initial transfer commission, the intermediary also is paid an annual fee of about 0.25 per cent of the fund, on top of which is the 1-1.3 per cent of the fund paid for the annual purchase of the annuity. All of which comes out of your hard-earned pension investment. Last week, the Life Association of Scotland (LAS) launched its own version of staggered vesting, backed up by a computer software package for its own tied agents which can be leased by independent advisers. LAS follows Sun Life, Provident Life and Clerical Medical, all of which have homed in on this developing market. But however good - or bad - the underlying pension product, it is the work of the intermediary that is critical in staggered vesting. Some of the specialist pensions advisers offer considerable expertise and are prepared to rebate a significant chunk of the transfer commission to the client. Independent advice is essential in selecting the best personal pension plan for transfer, and the best annuity rates on an annual basis. Moreover, staggered vesting has wider implications for the pensions market as a whole. There is a strong case for viewing pensions as a form of insurance, rather than as an investment vehicle. Standard annuities operate on this principle. If a significant proportion of annuity-holders fund their annual income through staggered vesting, this will skew the terms on which providers are able to offer annuity rates to the detriment of the majority. Most people are served best by a guaranteed retirement income. Where there are surplus funds, these can be invested separately. Products designed to combine insurance and investment tend to benefit the life offices and intermediaries, who build in extra charges carefully hidden by the complexity of the product structure. In this respect staggered vesting is no exception.</p>

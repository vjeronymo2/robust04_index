			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Food: An American foody in London - Eating Out / The latest trends in US dining arriving with the new batch of burger joints and pizza bars BRITONS who think American dining begins and ends with burgers and pizza are about to have their perceptions altered. Three American-influenced restaurants have recently opened in central London, offering a more accurate impression of how Americans dine than was previously available in Britain. Another is supposed to be on the way. The Criterion Brasserie, a co-operative venture between Bob Peyton's My Kinda Town Restaurants and Rocco Forte's hotel chain, opened in Piccadilly in September featuring American-influenced Italian cuisine. In October, TGI Friday's, the US restaurant chain owned in the UK by Whitbread, opened its 11th British restaurant, in Coventry Street off the Haymarket. Mezzaluna, a popular New York Italian-American restaurant, opened in the renovated Neal's Centre in Covent Garden last month, the brainchild of American Neal Grossman. And sometime later this year, the much-hyped, superstar-owned Planet Hollywood is supposed to finally materialise. These restaurants are certainly American in their ubiquity. Londoners will not able to walk down the street without seeing a new American restaurant which is what it has been like in the US for the past decade. Dining has become America's premier participation and spectator sport and its conspicuous consumption of choice, with new restaurants opening  - and lately, thanks to the recession, closing - at breakneck pace. Many Britons consider TGI Friday's 'American Bistros' the quintessential American restaurants. Since its opening in 1966, its British flagship restaurant, tucked between the Covent Garden Piazza and the Strand, has become the most popular TGI Friday's in the world, with queues stretching out of the door and youths packed into the bar on weekends. Its 'new' restaurant in Coventry Street about which, of course, there is really nothing new - is just a five-minute walk away from the flagship store. What Friday's sells is its version of the American dining experience - huge portions of burgers, ribs, salads, desserts, and frothy cocktails served up by friendly staff in a party-like atmosphere. TGI Friday's British prices are, on average, twice as high as those in the US (potato skins with bacon, cheese, and sour cream cost Pounds 6.85 in Britain, Pounds 3.54 in the US, a bacon cheeseburger Pounds 7.50 in Britain, Pounds 3.45 in the US, and mocha mud pie Pounds 4.75 in Britain, Pounds 2.05 in the US.) This American must inform Britons, though, that TGI Friday's is not an accurate picture of US dining. It's an indication of the restaurant-trend time lag between the US and the UK. The loud and brassy chord Friday's is striking with Britons is decidedly out of tune with its current American image: serviceable, family-oriented, and outdated. Very 'early '80s.' Over the past decade the sameness of chain restaurants such as Friday's has gone out of style in the US. Now, the watchwords at US restaurants are individuality and uniqueness. The force behind this trend is star chefs such as Californians Wolfgang Puck and Alice Waters whose restaurants - Puck's Spago in Los Angeles and Waters' Chez Panisse in Berkeley - put an emphasis on freshness and quality of ingredients, novelty and authenticity of preparation, and above all, the eccentric inspiration of the chef. Following star chefs has become an obsession for many Americans, and dining almost a religious experience, its disciples colloquially called 'foodies.' Given American dining's past British success, it is no surprise that its latest trend has found its way to Britain. But will fully-fledged American foodyism really catch on in Britain? In its purest form, probably not. The example of Columbus, Neal Grossman's first restaurant, is instructive. The South Kensington restaurant, opened in 1990, was Grossman's attempt to introduce Wolfgang Puck-style 'California cuisine' to Britain. Criticism of Columbus, and its menu which included such items as monkfish ceviche with tequila and lime and eggplant teriyaki pizza, swung from reverential to disgusted; it never found its audience and lasted only 18 months. Many industry experts question whether Grossman, a Harvard MBA with no training as a chef, really belonged at Columbus' culinary helm. He thinks, though, that the problem was the shock of the new: 'London couldn't handle what we were doing with Columbus, but we paved the way so that the British will be more receptive to American-style dining.' With Mezzaluna, Grossman is wisely attempting a more recognisable and tame concept - the New York-style Italian trattoria, one of the biggest American restaurant trends of the late 80s which has already manifested itself in Britain at such restaurants as Joe Allen's Orso in Exeter Street, Covent Garden and The Blueprint Cafe in Butler's Wharf, east London. True to the foody spirit, Grossman has brought over Marco Divina, the chef from the original Mezzaluna in New York, and is giving him full charge of the kitchen. There's an emphasis on lighter eating - 'almost no meat, just a little bit of olive oil, and not a cream sauce in sight,' says Grossman - and on reasonable prices. He expects diners to spend about Pounds 12.50 at lunch and Pounds 17.50 at dinner. 'London has cheap-and-cheerful restaurants, and really serious and pricey restaurants like the River Cafe and Lincontro, but nothing in between. This city needs affordable, good quality food in an effervescent and entertaining setting. That's what they'll get here,' says Grossman. Like Mezzaluna, Bob Peyton's Criterion Brasserie is located in central London in a recently restored historic building - Thomas Verity's 1874 neo-Byzantine Criterion Building in Piccadilly. And like Grossman's restaurant, the Criterion features US-influenced Italian cuisine, and emphasizes reasonable prices in a lively and stylish ambiance. The strongest difference between the two restaurants is their owners' visions of them. Unlike Grossman, Peyton says he does not buy the US restaurant hype: 'The star chef is dead. Foodies are boring. Foodies are people who live in America and have to 'ooh and aah' every time they see an arugula leaf. That's not what 99 per cent of the people who eat are about. That's not why I go out to eat.' In spite of Peyton's protestations, his new restaurant does have a foody air about it. Its husband-and-wife chef team, Gale Gand and Rick Tramanto, are Americans with impressive culinary pedigrees who have put items such as roast garlic squid with lemon oil, and charred beef carpaccio - if that is not a contradiction in terms - on their menu. The Criterion certainly draws on current US dining trends and will probably go far in popularising those innovations in Britain. It is going to take some time, though. The Criterion's most popular menu item in its bumper first month of business? Steak and chips.</p>

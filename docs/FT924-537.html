			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / People: Telecom Eireann Ron Bolger, 44, a managing partner in the Stokes, Kennedy, Crowley accountancy firm in Dublin, has been appointed as the new chairman of Telecom Eireann, the Irish state-run telecommunications company. Bolger will be Telecom's fourth chairman in twelve months. He replaces John Scanlan, who held the post on a temporary basis after his predecessor Brendan Hynes was sacked last July. Hynes' 'hands-on' approach to rationalisation in the company had led to a rupture with the company board. Hynes' predecessor, Michael Smurfit, who is the chairman of the Jefferson Smurfit Group, resigned in September 1991 after the then prime minister Charles Haughey asked him to step aside pending the outcome of a public enquiry into a controversial property deal which involved Smurfit. Bolger is a specialist in taxation and corporate finance and was a member of the board of Greencore, the Irish sugar and foods group, until last September.</p>

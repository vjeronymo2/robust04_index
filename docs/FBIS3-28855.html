In a statement, the Foreign Ministry said  the stakes in Bosnia are high for the international community  and failure to effectively implement the latest ultimatum would  lead not only to more innocent lives lost in Bosnia, it could  also send a wrong signal that the international community is now  prepared to tolerate and accept aggression.    The Foreign Ministry notes that the immediate response of  the  Bosnian Serbs has been to call for a cease-fire around Sarajevo.  However, the ministry adds that the Bosnian Serbs have  established a cynical pattern of bending to international  pressures but immediately reverting to their indiscriminate  attacks when the threat of military action is lifted.</p>

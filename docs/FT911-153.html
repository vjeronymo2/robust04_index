			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / International Capital Markets: Broking by banks under review JAPANESE securities companies, under pressure to allow banks into their industry, have reaffirmed their opposition to banks entering stockbroking, the most lucrative part of their business. However, they are prepared to see banks compete in the underwriting market, according to a draft report to the Ministry of Finance made public over the weekend. The concessions are unlikely to satisfy banks or end a prolonged debate over the reform of Article 65 of the Securities and Exchange Law - Japan's version of the Glass-Steagall Act in the US. The draft report, prepared by a study panel of the Securities and Exchange Council, an advisory body to the ministry, recommends allowing banks to lead-manage publicly-placed bonds through subsidiaries, and to issue privately-placed bonds. However, it says banks should, 'for the time being,' be banned from broking, the backbone of the securities companies' profits. The Securities and Exchange Council, organised by the Finance Ministry's securities bureau, represents the views of the securities industry. A parallel report, representing the views of banks, is expected to be published soon. It will probably call for banks to be granted more comprehensive access to the securities market, including early entry into broking. The reports are part of a review of the barriers separating banks and securities companies under Article 65. The ministry wants to implement reforms by 1993. Officials are having to balance the demands of banks for change with calls from the securities industry, particularly small and medium-sized companies, for preserving the status quo. A ministry official said the final reports of the securities and the banking industries are expected to be presented to the ministry at the end of May, or some time in June.</p>

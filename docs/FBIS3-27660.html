			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, Feb 25 (AFP)--Hong Kong Governor Chris  Patten on Friday published the second part of his controversial  1997 democratic reform package which will extend voting rights  to about 2.7 million people in the territory. Ignoring China's  vehement objections, he published the bill in the government  gazette, less than 24 hours after the Legislative Council  approved the first phase of his reform plans.    Publication immediately sent the local stock exchange  plunging, with the Hang Seng index down nearly five percent at  the opening, pushing it below the 10,000 point level for the  first time in three months. It had already fallen 3.1 percent  Thursday following the Legislative Council's approval of the  first phase with investors worried by the worsening Sino-British  relations. China told Britain Thursday that the door was now  firmly closed on negotiations and said it would scrap whatever  political system Britain put in place when it resumed  sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997.    The latest reform bill, which must be adopted by July, will  dramatically extend the voting franchise so that all 2.7 million  Hong Kong workers can elect people to 30 seats in the  legislature reserved for special interest groups. "This will  broaden the franchise for the commercial, industrial, finance  and financial services, real estate and construction, tourism,  social services, and labour functional constituencies," a  government spokesman said. He said the bill would be introduced  in the Legislative Council on March 9.    China has also expressed its anger over Britain 's  publication of a 36-page White Paper on why seven months of  negotiatons with China on Hong Kong's poltical future collapsed  in November. Beijing has promised "due action" in return, but  has not specified what this will be. In the White Paper -- of  which 200,000 copies are being distributed in Hong Kong --  Britain alleged that China had refused to clarify whether it  would retroactively apply a ban on legislators it considered  were involved in "undermining the socialist system in the  mainland."</p>

			<p><P> October 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHILD'S PLAY: AROUND HOME;  </P> <P> THE AU PAIR OPTION  </P> <P> IT'S THE BIGGEST PROBLEM working parents face: finding competent child care.  American-born nannies and care-givers are scarce; families who hire  undocumented foreign workers to care for their children are breaking the law  and flirting (however remotely) with prosecution.  </P> <P> There is now a legal alternative. To give more foreign students a chance to  sample American life, the United States Information Agency (USIA) issues  special one-year J-1 visas to young women (and some men) from 13 western  European countries to live with American families, care for children and carry  on a modest education program. Candidates must be 18 to 25 years old, have a  secondary school education, fluency in English and experience in child care.  </P> <P> American families pay a sponsor about $3,500 for air fare, training and health  insurance. They pay their au pair a stipend of $100 per week, give him or her a  room, two weeks of paid vacation and subsidize up to $300 in tuition.  </P> <P> An au pair is not "hired help" -- he or she is to be included as a family  member in meals and family activities. Au pairs may work up to 45 hours per  week. Although not responsible for heavy cleaning, they are expected to perform  light housekeeping chores related to the children and, like a family member,  contribute to the neatness of the common areas of the home.  </P> <P> Five venerable student exchange programs have been approved as sponsors by the  USIA and now find themselves in the nanny business. All operate under the same  USIA ground rules, and each can bring in up to 2,840 au pairs per year. They  screen and interview candidates, then match them with prospective host  families. Although families do not interview candidates directly, there is an  opportunity for correspondence and a chance for all parties to get to know one  another before the year begins.  </P> <P> All programs employ counselors to ease the adjustment and to make sure that the  agreed-upon working arrangement is being honored by all concerned. In case of a  non-fit between au pair and family, the au pair will be placed in another home  and the host family will receive a replacement. However, the original match-up  succeeds about 85% of the time, odds which are at least as good as in most new  employer-employee relationships.  </P> <P>  The five au pair sponsors and their parent organizations are:  </P> <P>  AuPairCare, Academic Year in the USA, (800) 288-7786.  </P> <P>  AuPair Homestay USA, Experiment in International Living, (202) 628-7134.  </P> <P>  EurAuPair, ASSE International Student Exchange, (800) 333-3894.  </P> <P>  E.

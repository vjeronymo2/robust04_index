			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 29 KYODO -- The Defense Agency will set  up a new working-level group with the U.S. Depertment of Defense  to promote reciprocal bilateral exchange of military technology,  agency officials said Sunday [29 May].    The agency expects the group to help make unilateral  military  technology transfer between the two countries reciprocal, the  officials said.    The first meeting of the "technology management group" will  be held in Washington in July. The group will be set up under  the Japan-U.S. Systems and Technology Forum, the officials said.    The group, expected to establish a "basic rule" for  bilateral  military technology exchange for the first time, will determine  the types of general-purpose technology suitable for such  exchange by the end of the year.    The officials said both nations will protect intellectual  rights when private interests are involved in military  technology transfers, by paying attention to the laws of each  nation and its independent policies, so that technology  procurement will be made on a commercial basis.    The United States has already shown interest in such  Japanese  technology as new materials and electronics, they said.    In 1983, Japan decided to open the way for transferal of  military technology to the U.S. as an exception to its principle  of banning arms export.</p>

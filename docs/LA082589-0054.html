			<p><P> August 25, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY MILK BOARD MAY LOSE AUTHORITY  </P> <P> The obscure Los Angeles County Milk Commission, which regulates the production,  distribution and sale of raw milk, is about to lose its low profile and  possibly its job.  </P> <P> A report due to come before the Board of Supervisors on Tuesday says the  commission has been more of an advocate than a watchdog for the lone company it  regulates -- Stueve Brothers Farms, a Chino dairy in neighboring San Bernardino  County. The report calls for the state, which currently regulates pasteurized  milk, to take over the commission's duties.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Asks for Inquiry  </P> <P> Chief Administrative Officer Richard B. Dixon also recommended that the state  Fair Political Practices Commission look into Commission Chairman Paul M.  Fleiss' work as a paid consultant to an attorney for Stueve Brothers.  </P> <P> The report was ordered last May after a Bay Area judge called the six-member  county panel a "captive" of Alta-Dena Dairies, a company formerly owned by  Stueve Brothers. Alta-Dena no longer produces raw milk. Stueve Brothers Farms  claims to be the state's largest raw milk dairy, producing 5,000 gallons a  week.  </P> <P> Alameda County Superior Court Judge John Sutter complained about the commission  while ruling that Stueve Brothers was running a misleading advertising campaign  touting the health benefits of raw milk. He noted that the commission relied on  the lone company it regulates for financial support and warned that such a cozy  relationship compromised the panel and weakened its effectiveness.  </P> <P> The dairy provides the commission with clerical help, including the typing of  commission minutes, Dixon said, and the commission's budget, including travel,  is paid for by the dairy. He said he does not know how large the budget is, nor  how the money is spent.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cites 'Machinations'  </P> <P> "The more I learned about the machinations of the commission, the more I  understood the conclusions of the Bay Area judge," Dixon said Thursday.  </P> <P> In his report, he wrote, "There are presently no established rules or  regulations governing operations of the commission, or the manner by which the  members are to be compensated."  </P> <P> "This office found evidence that the Milk Commission has failed to uphold its  standards for the certification of raw milk," Dixon wrote. He cited the  transcript from last spring's court case in which "it was disclosed that raw  milk with bacteria counts 10 times higher than the minimum standards" had been  certified by the commission and sold.  </P> <P> Fleiss, a pediatrician, was vacationing and could not be reached for comment.  Last May, he said that he worked as a consultant for the attorney for the  former Alta-Dena owners and reviewed medical literature and lawsuits filed  against the company. But he said he did not think it was necessary to list his  consulting job on his conflict-of-interest statement because the work did not  involve any cases that came before the commission.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'No Impropriety'  </P> <P> A spokesman for the Stueve Brothers said Thursday, "There has been absolutely  no impropriety."'  </P> <P> In recommending that the commission's duties be taken over by the state, Dixon  pointed out the commission was created in 1968 because the raw milk dairy was  located in Los Angeles County. Today, the dairy and milk-producing herds are in  San Bernardino County, and the raw milk is distributed statewide.  </P> <P> Dr. Robert S. Neuenschwander, a commission member since 1983, insisted Thursday  that he and his fellow members are independent.  </P> <P> "I certainly don't want any milk to be sold that will be unsafe to anybody," he  said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cause of Concern  </P> <P> He expressed concern about Dixon's recommendation to turn over the job to the  state. "Many people in Sacramento are very hostile to the concept of raw milk,  and I think this would be a good way in their minds to stamp this business  out."  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RACIST KILLING IN BENSONHURST  </P> <P> I would like to explain what racism is. I refer to your front-page article on  Bensonhurst (Sept. 2) and some of the comments made by the Rev. Charles  Fermiglia. Fermiglia suggested that it is a fact that blacks commit a  disproportionate number of violent crimes, and blames the community's attitudes  on the mass media. While it is true that blacks commit more violent crimes, it  also is a fact that 90% of these violent crimes are committed by 10% of the  population. Blaming an entire group for the actions of a few of its members is  called racism.  </P> <P> Fermiglia was partially right about the media, however. Partly he was just  trying to shift blame from his beloved Bensonhurst, but partly the media does  over-dramatize black crime. This is because it sells. A newsperson who suggests  to his editor that there should be a moratorium on reporting black violence, in  the public interest, will be laughed at.  </P> <P> Fermiglia's sin is that he so loves his community of Bensonhurst that he is  blind to the facts. He would probably defend his community against Jesus if  Jesus happened to wander into the neighborhood and get crucified!  </P> <P> ROBERT A. LEE  </P> <P> Pomona  </P></p>

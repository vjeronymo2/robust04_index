			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / International Company News: Record second-quarter earnings at Fannie Mae THE FEDERAL National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) reported record second-quarter profits yesterday as the favourable domestic interest rate environment continued to provide a foundation for strong earnings growth. The company, which is the largest mortgage provider in the US, announced profits of Dollars 458.8m in the second quarter, up 14 per cent on its earnings in the same three months of 1992. It was the 22nd consecutive record-breaking quarter for Fannie Mae and was achieved despite Dollars 39.8m in after-tax losses incurred from the call of debt at a premium and the repurchase of high-coupon debt. In the first quarter of this year Fannie Mae earned Dollars 443.6m, which took six-month profits to Dollars 902.4m, an increase of 15 per cent on the previous first half and on target for annual earnings to outpace the Dollars 1.62bn achieved in 1992. Mr James Johnson, Fannie Mae's chairman, said a number of factors were behind the latest record quarter, including strong growth in the company's mortgage portfolio, increased interest income from the investment of proceeds from repaid mortgage-backed securities, and continued high levels of miscellaneous income, especially fees earned from the sale of REMICs (real estate investment conduits). Fannie Mae's net interest income jumped 22 per cent to Dollars 632.1m following a 21.4 per cent increase in the size of the company's net mortgage portfolio to Dollars 170bn and a widening in its net interest margin (the difference between the interest it earns on mortgage loans and the interest it pays to borrow money) from 139 basis points to 143 basis points. The readings on the state of the US housing market suggested that there has been little change in conditions over the past year. Although Fannie Mae's acquisitions of single-family foreclosed properties rose slightly in the second quarter to 2,790, its serious delinquency rate for single-family loans, a key indicator of credit quality, declined to 0.59 per cent in May, down from 0.60 per cent in May 1992. Fannie Mae shares rose Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 85 3/4 by midday yesterday but later slipped to Dollars 82 5/8.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 1 (KCNA) -- The diametrically  different social systems in the North and South of Korea  represent a sharp contrast in the morality of the people.    In the Democratic People's Republic of Korea which is based  on collectivism all the members of society devote their all for  the country and people, the society and collective in a large  harmonious family.    Some time ago, Yim Kwang-chol, a soldier of the Korean  People's Army, covered a handgrenade with his body on the point  of its explosion, saving several dozen comrades at the cost of  his youthful life.    A coal miner Kim Kwang-ho threw himself under a coal car  rolling down at breakneck speed to save more than sixty fellow  workers and a schoolmistress Hwang Kil-yon died after saving  children from drowning. They were honest persons of the times  who dedicated their lives to the society, collective and  comrades.    It is not uncommon that men and women become parents of  orphans and sons and daughters of old folks with no one to  support them and looked after them like Yu Chong-sil living in  Haeju and Choe Hye- yong living in Pyongyang. Countless are  stories about beautiful deeds of working people. To cite a few  examples, Kim Yong-hui, a nurse at the Kim Man-yu Hospital,  donated her cornea to a blind man to give him sight, and many  medical workers donated their blood, flesh and bones without  hesitation to save critical cases, and train conductresses Kwon  Chong-hui and Pak Sun-yo found a brief-case containing more than  200,000 U.S. dollars and bank notes and returned it to its  owner, Hatsushi Akirashi, sales director of the Nippon Union Air  Service Company, Ltd.    But in South Korea, egoistic mode of life is prevalent in  the  society where the people think of only money, owing to the  infiltration of the American way of life and the anti- popular  policy pursued by the authorities.    A girl O Chong-hwa in Chinju, South Kyongsang Province,  stabbed her mother to death for money and valuables, a young man  in Iri, North Cholla Province, knocked down his father before  rushing to a bank and Ho Nam-kil murdered his son with a dagger  in Puchon, Kyonggi Province. Such crimes are reported every day.    Yi Chong-in in Yongdungpo-tong, Seoul, strangled his old  parents, saying they were burdensome, profiteers of the Kuro  Hospital attached to the Korea University threw away a moribund  patient on to the street when he, without a guardian, could not  pay the doctor's fee and young men and women killed their  girlfriends or boyfriends for a few dollars.    The South Korean ruling quarters, far from protecting the  orphans, sell them off to other countries to gain foreign  currency. The exported children average four thousand annually.    To the astonishment of the people, wives of the privileged  quarters form "gambling gangs playing for heavy stakes running  into hundreds of millions of won," and unhesitatingly commit  crimes, travelling everywhere.    If such vices are to be cleared away, the working people  must  become the master of the country.</p>

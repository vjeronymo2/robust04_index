			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Technology: Cashless society in Denmark Ole Christensen set off for work in the Danish town of Naestved without a kroner in his pocket, but still managed to park his car on a meter, buy lunch in the canteen, phone his wife from a call box and wash his shirt in the launderette on the way home. Instead of cash, Ole was carrying a new plastic prepayments card, which can be used for a wide range of small transactions. His town is the pilot site for the card, which the operating company, Danmont, claims is the most advanced in the world. The service should become accessible throughout Denmark by March. Henning Jensen, managing director, is already receiving international inquiries. Danmont differs from existing prepayments cards because it is an open system, in which a card from any issuer can be used to buy services from any participating supplier. Eight banks and the local telephone company, KTAS, have so far issued 18 different designs of card with a value of Pounds 10 to Pounds 30. They contain a microchip which deducts the value of each transaction and credits the relevant supplier. Rechargeable cards should be available by 1994. Henning Jensen says the cashless society is working well in Naestved. Some 4,000 cards have been tested in launderettes, food and drink vending machines, parking meters and public telephones. The system is geared to individual transactions averaging under Pounds 1, which do not require a receipt. Danmont - set up just over a year ago by KTAS and Danish Payments Systems, the direct debit card company - acts as a central clearing house for payments. For the cost of installing a terminal, and a flat fee of Pounds 125 a year, suppliers get a secure and reliable method of charging which is vandal-proof. Siemens is supplying the chip used in the cards and several Danish suppliers have developed terminals. Singapore will start testing a common stored value card next year, and Atlanta plans one for the 1996 Olympic Games. Meanwhile, Danish equipment manufacturers are helping to shape standards for an eventual common European system.</p>

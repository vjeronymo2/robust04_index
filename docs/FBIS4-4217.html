			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By XINHUA Reporter Lin Minzhong (2651 3046 1813) and RENMIN </F> RIBAO Reporter Guan Yanzhong (4619 1750 1813)]    [Text] Buenos Aires, 22 Apr (XINHUA) -- The autumn sun in  the Argentine capital was genial and charming. After 1500  [local time] on the afternoon of 22 April, Hu Jintao and his  party arrived by car in San Nicolas, a town located 30 km to the  south of Buenos Aires. They enthusiastically visited the town's  community training center.    Hu Jintao came to the training center warden Cuellar's house  first. Cuellar was about 50 years old and strong. He and his  whole family happily welcomed the visiting CPC delegation.  Touching the shoulder of Miguel, Cuellar's young son, Hu Jintao  cordially asked: "How old are you?" The child bashfully  answered: "Eight years old." His mother Naomi interrupted:  "He was working at the vegetable farm just now." Hu Jintao  praised him: "You really are a good boy." After hearing this,  his parents smiled happily.    Hu Jintao presented gifts of embroidered table cloth, a  Chinese painting, and colorful velvet birds to Cuellar's family.  Holding a velvet bird, young Miguel innocently asked: "Where  did the bird come from?" Hu Jintao humorously said: "It flew  over here from China." The answer made everyone laugh.    Community training centers are a type of nongovernment  educational organization that has appeared in Argentina in  recent years. Their objectives are to train youngsters from  poor areas to master certain skills to earn a living or get  jobs. The government has affirmed the project and supplied  partial subsidies. The San Nicolas Community Training Center  has 17 teachers and nearly 100 students. It mainly teaches  techniques for carpenters, bricklayers, blacksmiths, and  vegetable farmers.    Hu Jintao asked detailed questions on the course system,  curricula, the number of students, and the source of funds.  Personnel in charge of the training center answered all his  questions in succession.    Hu Jintao visited the training center's vegetable farm and  noticed that sprinkling irrigation facilities -- made by  students out of plastic bottles and plastic pipes -- were  sprinkling water evenly on the young plants. He said happily:  "These are home-made sprinkling irrigation facilities. The  kids are very smart." It has been learned that the vegetable  farm has been converted from a garbage dump. Vegetables growing  in the farm include green lettuce, unripened tomatoes, big  cabbages, eggplants, onions, and greens. Hu Jintao asked  Orlando, a student working at the farm, how long he has been  training. Orlando answered: "Two years." Hu Jintao asked  again: "Can you properly handle a vegetable farm if one is  handed over to you?" The student nodded and said: "Yes." The  Chinese guest wished him success.    Hu Jintao said to the teachers, students, and residents who  gathered at the edge of the vegetable farm: "On behalf of the  Chinese people, I am extending cordial greetings to you. The  community conducts technical training classes to help youths get  jobs in an effort to improve everyone's living standards. We  are very interested in the project. Some people in China are  still poor and the government is taking measures to help them  shake off poverty. We have come to learn from your  experiences." As soon as he finished, everyone energetically  clapped their hands.</p>

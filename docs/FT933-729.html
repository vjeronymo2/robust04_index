			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Town hall workers accept pay ceiling WHITE-COLLAR town hall workers have voted by 2-1 against taking strike action in protest at the government's 1.5 per cent pay ceiling, Lisa Wood writes. The 500,000 workers are the last big group of workers, apart from the firefighters, to accept the government's pay ceiling for this year. Council staff including secretaries, surveyors and social workers had previously voted to reject the 1.5 per cent. Mr Dennis Reed, the chief negotiator for Unison, the public sector union, said most members had voted before the chancellor's fresh warning of a pay freeze for public sector workers next year. He said they had been influenced by the fact that most workers had already settled within the ceiling.</p>

			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INNOVATION: IGNORE CORPORATE MEDIA AT YOUR OWN RISK  </P> <P> To really grasp the Fifties, you'd want to see the McCarthy hearings, Edward R.  Murrow, Uncle Miltie and "Rebel Without a Cause"; you'd want to read "Lolita"  and "Catcher in the Rye"; you'd want to hear the music of Elvis, Pat Boone and  Chuck Berry.  </P> <P> The media may not define pop culture, but they certainly capture and reflect  it. What's true for pop culture also holds for organizational culture. A decade  ago, you could grasp the essence of an organization by sitting in on a few  meetings and rummaging through the interoffice memos. Starting in the mail room  wasn't all that crazy an idea.  </P> <P> Today, organizations are becoming far more media-intensive. It's not just that  they're using computers and telecommunications networks to manage data; they're  packaging information in new ways. They're making videotapes and creating  internal television networks. They're crafting "expert systems" -- computer  programs that embody the technical expertise of company old-timers -- and using  fax or electronic mail as the medium of instantaneous communication. The  "old-boy" network has taken on a technological hue. Personal interactions are  increasingly mediated, complemented and/or captured by an increasingly  elaborate media mesh.  </P> <P> "There is a sense of much greater visibility," observes Thomas W. Malone,  director of MIT's Center for Coordination Science. "We're coming to live more  and more in a sea of information; in principle, things that may have once been  unknowable are now easy to find out.  </P> <P> "Some people have talked about the dawning of the age of electronic  communications as being analogous to the dawn of history in the sense that  there's no written record of prehistoric times," he adds. "As more  communication is stored electronically, it makes it easier to analyze,  reconstruct, capture and understand the communications of organizations. It's  much more difficult to reach back into 'prehistoric' times before there was  such culture."  </P> <P> What are the production values for a presentation? Will a transparency be  enough or do people insist on 35-mm. color slides? Must financial projections  be number-crunched through Lotus 1-2-3 or Microsoft Excel spreadsheet software?  Are in-house training programs built around videocassettes, flip charts or  multimedia-flavored personal computers?  </P> <P> These are the questions that managers will increasingly ask themselves to  understand how the organization creates its internal models of reality. The  answers to these questions reveal aspects of the organization's culture that  may have been previously hidden. These technologies have become cultural  artifacts.  </P> <P> Many organizations are beginning to tape and transcribe meetings. In the few  years, computer voice/text editors will index those sessions according to the  desired key word. Want to know who said what at the meeting about  "productivity"? Just ask the workstation. Some Silicon Valley companies and  giant consumer goods firms now use camcorders to record sales presentations and  technical reviews. These tapes don't just preserve the data; they preserve the  organization's style. These technologies are becoming a new storehouse for the  organization's values, not just its information.  </P> <P> "There are a lot of people who are beginning to worry about this," says Jeff  Sturchio, the corporate archivist for Merck, the pharmaceutical firm. "Cultures  are based very much on interpersonal relations, but as organizations get  larger, in order to manage the organizations, they have to rely on some of the  new media because there's no other way to get the message out."  </P> <P> In fact, says Sturchio, Merck currently produces and distributes a weekly  three-minute news video for in-house consumption. The company is also putting  together a multimedia presentation for its centennial next year. "That's the  kind of mirror of Merck culture that we will save," Sturchio notes. By  contrast, "the phenomenon of the electronic lab notebook troubles me because  I'm not certain how to deal with it."  </P> <P> But Sturchio freely acknowledges that the growth of these new media is  transforming his job. He says it's too early for him to comment on how these  new media are transforming Merck's culture.  </P> <P> "It's media as the life of the mind of the organization," asserts Mark Stefik,  a researcher at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center who designs knowledge  management systems. "Let me give you an example. If you experience a  presentation that's very persuasive, you might want to capture as much of it as  you could. 'I really need that set of slides or that chart or that figure that  summarized a trend.' When people find these compact cultural memes, they seize  on them."  </P> <P> New media technologies are where these new memes -- compelling ideas -- are  developed and transmitted. "The technological content of corporate life is  rising," Stefik says. "We'll have computer data, electronic blackboard inputs,  audio recordings of meetings, etc.; multimedia technology will enable us to tie  these things and retrieve them."  </P> <P> This isn't an issue for the sociologists and anthropologists; it's an issue  that will determine how organizations see and manage themselves in an  increasingly competitive environment.  </P> <P> Twenty years ago, you couldn't ignore the memo. Ten years ago, you couldn't  ignore the phone. Today, you can't ignore the computer network and voice mail.  Tomorrow's managers shouldn't be surprised if they spend as much time managing  media as they do managing people. They will be immersed in a far denser, far  richer, far more comprehensive regime of technologies than they are today. To  understand the culture of the organization, they will have to be able to  interpret its media. If they want to shape the values and direction of their  organizations, they must learn how to manipulate those media.  </P> <P> "These technologies," says MIT's Malone, "are going to change the  organizational balance of power in ways that we can't yet anticipate."  </P></p>

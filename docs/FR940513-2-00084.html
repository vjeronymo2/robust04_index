The deadline date for submitting applications under this sub-priority area is July 12, 1994. Eligible applicants are restricted to public or non-profit community-level agencies, organizations, or institutions in communities where Family Friends or VSA projects have not previously been funded.

Applicants for this grant must demonstrate an extensive knowledge base relating to Family Friends and strong experience in providing technical assistance and training to such projects. On the basis of its strong knowledge base and its assessment of the progress of the demonstration projects, the grantee will be expected to assist projects in implementing their demonstrations and to offer recommendations for future program initiatives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The application must include a plan for assisting approximately six (6) demonstration projects. Plans should include at least one site visit to each project and a ``cluster'' meeting for the new model projects funded under priority area 5.2A. The successful applicant under this section is responsible for assisting the six (6) funded projects with the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Providing timely and relevant background information regarding effective Family Friends programming;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Training and technical assistance in developing Family Friends programs;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Assisting in strategic planning for the long term continuation of the programs; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Conduct research studies on the VSA Program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Funding for this award will be for approximately $80,000 per year for a project period of up to three (3) years. The deadline date for submitting applications under this sub-priority area is July 12, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 5.3&blank;Volunteer Service Credit Demonstrations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under this priority area, the Administration on Aging is soliciting applications from public agencies and nonprofit organizations to test new models and replicate existing models of the volunteer service credits concept. A primary focus should be on home and community based services that help at-risk elders to continue to live in their homes, e.g. shopping, transportation, telephone reassurance and friendly visiting, light housekeeping, and respite care. Preference will be given to model projects which significantly involve low-income, minority, and rural elderly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The basic service credit concept is to give volunteers a unit of credit for each service hour performed, regardless of the type of service, in the expectation that accrued credits will be redeemed for services by the volunteers at some future time of need. A centralized accounting system must be maintained to keep track of credits and match up volunteers with recipients. As a practical matter, limitations on the number and type of services offered are necessary as are rules that govern accumulation and use of credits. After initial start-up and operation, a steady and continuing source of core financial assistance is needed to (1) administer the system, (2) guarantee redemption of built-up credits in those cases when the type of immediate service need cannot be met by the volunteer services then available, and (3) off-set credit deficits incurred when recipients, because of illness or other circumstances, cannot repay the services provided to them with volunteer effort.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Administration on Aging has funded several service credit demonstration projects in the past. Most recently five (5) two-year service credit demonstrations were funded along with a technical assistance project. AoA funded projects specifically designed to help volunteers become more involved in helping older people in their communities. Of the demonstration sites funded, several utilized churches as a base for the recruitment of volunteers. One project linked service credits in a business and industry setting. Applicants may wish to contact the AoA funded service credit projects to learn more about the specifics of the grants. Information regarding these demonstrations may be obtained by contacting the Office of Program Development at (202) 619&hyph;0441.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of this priority area is to test the feasibility of implementing the service credit concept in new areas and to replicate existing models in new sites. Among the possible areas for testing and replicating the service credit concept are (1) corporate retirement benefit programs; (2) programs under the sponsorship of fraternal organizations; (3) social and health maintenance insurance programs where volunteer services are credited with partial payment in lieu of fees and premiums under newly-designed community long term care service packages; (4) low income housing programs in which residents provide services to low-income minority elderly; (5) programs in residential retirement communities; (6) programs involving union retirees; (7) employer based service credit projects under which employees assist the elderly in their community and (8) church-based service credit programs involving assistance to low-income minority elderly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicants are encouraged to solicit co-sponsoring community organizations, including youth groups to donate volunteer services to individuals who cannot become full participants of the service credit program or to compensate older volunteers with services not provided by participants in the service credit program. Projects using co-sponsoring organizations must incorporate this support in a manner that does not detract from the central feature of the service credit concept of having older persons earn volunteer credits in exchange for future services when they are needed. Accordingly, enrollment of volunteers eligible to be full participants in the program should be limited to persons age 55 and over (spouses excepted).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

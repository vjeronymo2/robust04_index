			<p>Language: <F P=105> Kazakh </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Amantay Bazarbayuly Zholdybayev, chief of </F> the Kazakh Civil Aviation Administration, recorded by Saghidola  Akhmetqaliyev: We Are a People Who Understand How To Soar to the  Heavens..."]    [Text] I have been involved for some time with the  editors of the magazine ZERDE, and there have been cases where I  have written articles about general aviation, aircraft, and the  aviation industry. Articles and thoughts were intended to  increase the knowledge of the Kazakh reader about aviation and  to draw more of our young people into that specialty.    I myself worked in the sector for more than 30 years, and I  am now a pensioner. I make the following observations: while we  are a very great people, a great nation, there are very few of  our young people in civil aviation. There are in fact many  reasons for this. We have now become an independent people, and  we are proud of the fact that Kazakhstan is an independent  nation. This is a joy and a delight. However, for us to be a  sovereign nation in fact we will have to have our own  specialists in every sector, that is our own architects, our own  pilots, our own ministers of state.    Recently there have been changes, even if small ones, taking  place in civil aviation in the Republic. One of the best things  about this is that at the head of it all is one of our own  people, a man called Amantay Bazarbayuly Zholdybayev. We must  tell the truth. Since the formation of the Kazakh Civil Aviation  Administration, there has never been a Kazakh holding the post  of chief of the administration..    Recently the editors of ZERDE asked me to talk with the new  head of the Civil Aviation Administration, and to exchange  views, so that the people would know who he is and where he  comes from, and to prepare an article for the magazine about my  interview. I am not a journalist, nor am I a reporter. While I  wondered in my mind how I could do it, I realized that I had  done a certain amount of work in the aviation sector, and that  its inner workings were somewhat more familiar to me than to  others, and, for that reason, I should go ahead and interview  Zholdybayev and write the article. I considered it my duty to  today's young people as someone senior and as a former aviation  bort engineer [sic].    It has been said by others, whether out of envy or out of a  grudge, that the new chief has only flown an AN-2 and knows  nothing about other kinds of aircraft. We must understand the  reason for this statement and its basis. People, who have  control of their own lives and who have not been as successful  as they could be, should not be terribly jealous of others.    According to what I know, Amantay has indeed flown an AN-2.  He has flown aircraft such as the AN-24, IL-18, YAK-40, Tu-154,  and IL-76, and has gained experience at several levels. Not only  has he flown these planes, but, hitherto, has been in various  management positions. You can tell this from the conversation  below.    [Akhmetqaliev] Amantay, from the beginning we have been a  people who have known how to fly to the heavens, into the  heights, into the blue. The passage of time has permitted our  becoming a sovereign country. May you be successful in your new  post! The people do not know you as well as they should. For  that reason would you first of all talk about yourself?    [Zholdybayev] What can I say about my biography?... I came  into the world at the end of the war, that is in 1944 in Atbasar  City, Aqmola Oblast. After completing school I worked on the  railroad for several years. From childhood I have wanted to  become a flier. Led by that hope, at 18 I entered the Civil  Aviation Flier Training School at Karasnokutsk in Saratov  [Oblast]. After completing this school, I returned to Aqmola. I  began my career as a flier by flying AN-2s. Later I flew AN-24s.  In time I completed the Civil Air Line Academy in Leningrad, the  present St. Petersburg. Refining my professional experience and  knowledge in this area, I learned to fly other kinds of aircraft  and to master them. In general the profession of pilot has its  own difficulties. You know there is a school for the mastery of  each type of aircraft.    [Akhmetqaliyev] You were a pilot and now you manage pilots.  That is an art in and of itself. It is difficult to do two  entirely different things. For example, I was by profession a  bort engineer. I never took part in administrative/managerial  activities.    [Zholdybayev] I agree.    Professionals should manage pilots and the aviation sector  in  general. During the years 1980-1983 I managed the Semey airport,  after that I managed Qaraghandy Airport. However, starting in  1987 I was first deputy chief of the Kazakh Civil Aviation  Administration. Thus, I well understood the difficulties and  responsibilities of the chief of the administration. However, I  am far from saying that I know everything. This is because life  makes new demands with each passing day. I think that we are  learning as things come up.    [Akhmetqaliyev] It is well known that all of our aircraft  and  other technology and equipment are an inheritance from the  former Union. We are now establishing connections with other  countries as an independent nation. These connections are  through air routes. However, travelers will be selecting more  convenient and more comfortable aircraft in the future. Our  aircraft cannot be compared with Boeings from the United States.  For that reason, are there thoughts about purchasing much higher  quality aircraft from foreign countries? What kind of  commercial steps are being undertaken?    [Zholdybayev] I am in agreement, my friend. This area is  already something difficult for us. This is because we are  suffering the pressure of financial exigency. Like others, we  would like to purchase the latest aircraft. However, our purse  is [too] empty for this. In the beginning we thought to purchase  foreign A-310 aircraft. This powerful aircraft is the best in  several ways, and is jointly made by all European countries.  Last year the Moscow International Sheremetyev Airport purchased  four of such aircraft. They are now flying from Moscow to  various countries in Europe and Southeast Asian. Judging by what  passengers say, these aircraft are comfortable and convenient.    The situation cannot remain as it is. Our financial  situation  will improve, and, if every thing works out, I think that there  will be a day when our travelers will ride on these aircraft.    [Akhmetqaliyev] You were talking about shortage of finances.  However, one thing worrying most people regarding aviation is  the continuing rise in the prices of airline tickets. What  explanations do you have to offer and what understanding can you  provide?    [Zholdybayev] The continued rise in the price of airline  tickets is not connected with us. This is not something which is  under our control or influence. Influencing this above all are  increases in the price of fuel and other needed materials,  equipment, and spare parts. In addition, we have to buy all  these things from others. We make none of them ourselves. For  that reason anyone can understand the degree to which we are  under the control of others.    However, common people consider it our fault when the cost  of  airline tickets is high. We must understand them. This is  because today's prices cannot be paid by every other person.  However, in an era of rapid change such as the present, they  have no choice but to fly.    Nonetheless, it is anticipated that only when prices begin  to  go down and the market economy is stabilized will our ticket  costs be controlled.    [Akhmetqaliyev] Amantay, as you yourself know, we must  prepare more specialists among our young people for civil  aviation. What I would like to ask in that regard is this: do  you have thoughts about having our young people study in foreign  countries, in developed countries in particular?    [Zholdybayev] Indeed, I have such thoughts. However, the  financial difficulties just mentioned will not allow us to  achieve them. This is because sending our young people abroad to  study will require foreign exchange. We have very little foreign  exchange at present. We have it for some purposes, but not for  others.    As I have said, there is a professional school in Aqtobe  City  at the level of an institution of higher education preparing  specialists for civil aviation. It will train pilot-engineers,  copilot-engineers, and air traffic controllers. Our young people  interested in these specialties will not have to go far, but  can, on the contrary, be trained there. They must pass tests in  Kazakh to be admitted. However, teaching entirely in Kazakh is  something for the future. Thorough preparation will be needed  for that. The most important requirement for those seeking  admittance will be the best possible health. After that literacy  and knowledge will be important.    There is one thing I wish to mention in this connection. I  must tell the truth. Our young people have no great interest in  aviation. They are more interested in the specialized  occupations that they encounter on a daily basis than in  aviation specialties. This is only to be expected. For that  reason, if we would like to increase the number of our own  specialists in aviation, we must begin professional training  within the walls of the schools. It would be all the more  wonderful if we, like the Japanese, were to teach kindergarden  children what is an airplane and who a pilot is.    However, our young people can go to the Institute for  Preparing Civil Aviation Engineers in Kiev if they pass the  entrance exams in Almaty. There is an agreement between  ourselves and that organization regarding the preparation of  such specialists.    [Akhmetqaliyev] Will aircraft be sold to individuals in  Kazakhstan? Recently we have heard a great deal about an  aircraft called MAI-890. Will individuals be able to buy this  aircraft?    [Zholdybayev] In most developed countries aircraft are sold  to individuals. However, these are not very large aircraft, but  aircraft seating two-three or five-six persons. Other than  owners of major industries who need such aircraft, no one, no  matter how much commotion they make or how famous they are, buys  large aircraft. This is because they know the price and place of  everything well. In addition, all things created by the hand of  a person with a clear intention, and with advanced conceptions  must serve the good of man.    However, as for the MAI-890 aircraft you recently mentioned,  it is true that it is a small aircraft built for commercial  purposes. It is an aircraft which would be very convenient for  sportsmen, farmers, geologists, firemen, motor vehicle  inspectorate workers, and for herdsmen working at a distance.  One could learn to fly it in a day. It is made from very  expensive metal and from high quality technology.    Was not the MIG-29 military aircraft tested by our first  cosmonaut Toqtar Awbakirov? The MAI-890 is manufactured by a  section of that plant [where the MIG-29 is manufactured]. Though  we are behind in other areas, we used to make powerful and high  quality military technology.    The MAI-890 was evaluated highly by the famous German test  pilot Doctor U. Unger. After flying the aircraft, he said: I  realize that this aircraft was created by pure experts. It is  small, convenient, and comfortable but we are doing nothing in  particular to sell it. This is because its initial price at the  1992 Moscow air show was 15,000 dollars. The price has now risen  further.    [Akhmetqaliyev] In soccer there are the players and the  fans.  That is to say, we have heard that along with managing you are  still going off on missions and flying. Is not it difficult to  perform two such responsible tasks at once.    [Zholdybayev] It is true, I still go off on long flights  with  Tu-154s and IL-76s. I notice no difficulty. In my view, it is  good to fly to keep up the level of one's skills. In one way  this helps me understand things more deeply as I set myself to  the task of managing.</p>

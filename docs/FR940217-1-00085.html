			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 668.94&blank;Termination. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary proposes to add  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> references to third-party servicers in this section to conform to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed changes governing termination proceedings in other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sections of this subpart. The Secretary proposes to specify that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a termination of a third-party servicer's eligibility to contract  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with an institution to administer a Title IV, HEA program ends  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the authority of the servicer to administer that program under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any existing contract between an institution and the servicer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, if a third-party servicer's eligibility is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> terminated, the servicer would be required to return to each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution (or otherwise dispose of according to the Secretary's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instructions) any funds received by the servicer under that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program for that institution or the institution's students. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicer also would be required to return to the institution all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> records pertaining to the servicer's administration of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's participation in that program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary believes that the termination of a third-party  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicer's eligibility to contract with an institution should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treated like the termination of an institution's participation in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a Title IV, HEA program. Not only should new contracts with an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution be prohibited, but the servicer's existing activities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involving the administration of that program also should cease.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, a third-party servicer may possess unexpended funds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under that program for an institution's students at the time that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> termination takes effect. The servicer should be required to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> return those funds to the institution so that those students may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receive their aid. The return of records to the institution is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> needed because of the recordkeeping requirements that the various  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title IV, HEA program requirements that the various Title IV, HEA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program regulations apply to institutions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 668.95&blank;Reimbursements, refunds, and offsets. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section would be amended to add references to third-party  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicers to conform to the proposed changes in the scope of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subpart.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 668.96&blank;Reinstatement after termination. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary proposes to add references to third-party servicers to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conform to proposed changes in the scope of this subpart. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary also proposes to eliminate the provision that permits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an institution to apply for reinstatement of its participation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> after three months if the institution's participation has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> terminated for engaging in substantial misrepresentation. Like  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions whose participation is terminated for other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> violations, the institution would be able to apply for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reinstatement only after 18 months from the date of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> termination, unless the institution also was debarred or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suspended under E.O. 12549 or the Federal Acquisition Regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (FAR), 48 CFR subpart 9.4. The Secretary further proposes to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extend these criteria to apply to a termination of a third-party  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicer's eligibility to contract with an institution to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administer any aspect of the institution's participation in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title IV, HEA programs if the basis for that termination was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engaging in substantial misrepresentation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Title IV, HEA programs are most effective only if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> students, other members of the public, and governmental and other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bodies can rely on the honesty of the representations of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution or the institution's agents. The harm that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantial misrepresentation does to the integrity of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title IV, HEA programs, to those who rely on the programs to help  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meet educational costs, and to the taxpayers who pay for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs should carry equal weight with the harm done by any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other violation of a Title IV, HEA program requirement. If an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's participation or third-party servicer's eligibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is terminated because the institution or servicer engaged in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantial misrepresentation, the consequence of that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> termination should be no less than the consequence of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> termination for other reasons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 668.97&blank;Removal of limitation. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposes to provide that an institution may not apply for removal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of a limitation before the later of (1) 12 months from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective date of the limitation, or (2) the expiration of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> debarment or suspension under E.O. 12549 or the FAR, 48 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subpart 9.4. Parallel to the requirement for institutions, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third-party servicer would be able to apply for removal of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limitation only after 12 months from the date of the limitation,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unless the servicer was also debarred or suspended.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

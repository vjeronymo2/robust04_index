			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina  Network in Serbo-Croatian at 1300 GMT on 7 April carries within  its regular 32-minute cast several reports on the situation in  the republic.    Enes Musovic reports that "four members of the UNPROFOR [UN  Protection Forces] Internal Commission sent by General Michael  Rose, commander of UN forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina, arrived in  Gorazde this morning in order to see the real situation in the  Gorazde region. They immediately went to the lines of  separation in order to visit this territory, which has been and  still is the venue of fierce fighting between aggressor's forces  and Gorazde defenders. As I report, the Drina Valley is shaking  with strong explosions. Chetniks have continued shelling all  defense lines around the besieged Gorazde as well as the  civilian districts. The most recent reports say that a fierce  artillery-infantry attack by the mad aggressor on [name  indistinct] Kamen and [name indistinct] from the direction of  Mesici is under way."    Mirza Aldobasic reports from the zone covered by the 7 South  Operations Group that "in the early morning hours, the aggressor  attacked the defense lines of the 203d Glorious Doboj-Bosna  Motorized Brigade, particularly in the Putnikovo Brdo region.  However, it was somehow calmer on other battlefields on these  free territories, although on a few occasions the enemy  attempted breakthroughs along the defense lines at Crni Vrh."    Studio announcer Arijana Barucija says that "it is somewhat  calmer in the zone of the 3d Corps and other battlefields in our  country, albeit still with occasional aggressor's activities  from infantry weapons and artillery pieces."</p>

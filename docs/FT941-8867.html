			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / International Company News: Air France's tight schedule for recovery - The loss-making airline has little room for manoeuvre Make or break time is fast approaching for Air France. Decisions taken over the coming weeks at the company's headquarters and government offices in Paris, and at the European Commission in Brussels, will determine whether the loss-making state-owned carrier can recover and whether it can be wrought into shape for privatisation. On Tuesday evening, Air France's 42,000 employees were sent a letter from Mr Christian Blanc who took over as chairman last October following the forced departure of Mr Bernard Attali, the victim of a violent strike and the withdrawal of government support for his rescue plan. The letter contains outline proposals for Mr Blanc's own recovery strategy and an appeal for staff support for his plan. The aim is to complete a package of recovery measures by the beginning of March. It will then require approval by the board and unions and be presented to the government. If, as expected, the plan includes an injection of capital, it is sure to be scrutinised by the European Commission. The schedule is tight. But the financial position facing the French airline leaves little room for manoeuvre. Recession in its principal markets and its high cost base prompted losses last year of about FFr7.5bn (Dollars 1.3bn). The company's debts are estimated at FFr36bn and its annual financial costs at about FFr3.3bn. 'I hear it said that we cannot go bankrupt. That is false,' says Mr Rodolphe Frantz, managing director, in an interview in the airline's internal newsletter. 'It is in the current quarter that the survival of the company will be decided. Never have we faced such a pressing danger.' There is method in Mr Frantz's gloomy message. In the wake of last year's disastrous strike, Mr Blanc and his management team have sought to convince the airline's employees of the need for fundamental and rapid reform. Warnings of the company's plight are part of the process. This has been combined with the establishment of performance targets needed to rescue the airline and the critical stage of designing measures to achieve these goals. The targets are clear. In a statement issued last December, Mr Blanc said that the airline must return to profit within the next three years. Revenues must be increased by 14 per cent by 1997 and financial costs must be halved by the end of 1998. Spending on equipment and salaries must fall by 7 per cent and 10 per cent respectively in each year until 1997, according to Mr Blanc. Now comes the hard part - how to achieve these ambitious goals. Mr Blanc has deliberately left himself room for manoeuvre on this score. 'The events of last year mean that he cannot reform by diktat' says one French banker. 'He needs to co-opt the personnel and give them a role in the recovery plan.' The new chairman has, however, indicated the means that might be employed to reach his ends. These include a series of proposals to reduce salary costs, such as a voluntary wage freeze or pay cuts. Higher-paid employees might be offered an equity stake in the airline in return for a reduction in their salaries. These proposals have some support from within the company. Results of a poll launched at the end of last year showed that of the 35 per cent of the company's employees who responded to a questionnaire, 51 per cent would accept a reduction in pay to help the airline survive. The idea of receiving shares in Air France in return for pay cuts was deemed an attractive idea by 64 per cent of respondents. Other proposals include a radical restructuring of the group's operations. Air France's activities could be broken up into separate profit centres, either along business or geographical lines, in an attempt to increase accountability and efficiency. 'It is necessary to completely rebuild the organisation,' Mr Blanc said in the letter to his staff. As in Mr Attali's rescue plan, non-core assets such as the Meridien hotels group, are expected to be sold to cut debts. Whatever the final shape of the plan, its success will depend on two substantial hurdles - the reaction of the unions and the company's ability to raise new capital. On the first count, Mr Blanc has sought to reduce opposition through consultation and by seeking alternatives to forced redundancies. Plans to cut 2,100 jobs this year, for example, are to be achieved through early retirements and attrition. But the fractured nature of the company's union organisation remains a grave threat. There are 14 unions at the airline, and the power of wildcat actions was clearly demonstrated during last year's strike. Even without industrial disputes, the rescue plan will mean little without a strengthening of the company's balance sheet. The airline is adamant that the government must play its role. 'If the state cannot give the necessary capital then the company will be condemned,' says Mr Frantz. The problem is the amount of capital needed, estimated at up to FFr8bn, and the reaction that a substantial allocation of state-aid would probably trigger in Brussels. The European Commission is already investigating a capital injection of FFr1.5bn made to Air France by the previous French government and has recently frozen a refinancing of Groupe Bull, the computer company. A report issued earlier this month, which was sponsored by the Commission, called for the end of state support for the European airline industry, although it left open the possibility of a 'one time, last time' dose of aid. Unless Mr Blanc can pull his plan together, there may not be a next time for Air France.  --------------------------------- NET PROFIT (LOSS) FFr m  --------------------------------- 1986              670 1987              720 1988            1,170 1989              850 1990            (720) 1991            (690) 1992          (3,200) 1993         (*7,500)  --------------------------------- *Estimated  ---------------------------------  ----------------------------------------                WORKFORCE  ---------------------------------------- 1986                    35,269 1987                    35,894 1988                    37,122 1989                    39,111 1990                    39,810 1991                    39,469 1992                   *44,596 1993                  **42,036  ---------------------------------------- *Includes UTA workforce after merger **At November 11Source: Air France  ----------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> July 7, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: MCKNIGHT RE-SIGNS WITH CHARGERS FOR ONE YEAR  </P> <P> Offensive lineman Dennis McKnight, entering his eighth year in the NFL, has  re-signed with the Chargers, the team announced Friday.  </P> <P> Financial terms of the one-year contract were not disclosed.  </P> <P> McKnight, scheduled to play left guard this year, started every regular-season  game in four consecutive seasons for the Chargers from 1985 to 1988 but missed  all of last season with a knee injury suffered during the final preseason game.  </P> <P> "We figured it was better to make a shorter deal because he is coming off an  injury and has to prove himself to a new general manager (Bobby Beathard),"  said McKnight's agent, Jim Steiner of St. Louis. "We'd rather he come back and  show (Beathard) that he can play like he did two years ago when he was an  alternate for the Pro Bowl, then we can go in and make a longer deal."  </P> <P> McKnight has played center, guard and tackle during his Charger career and  earned the spot as a Pro Bowl alternate in 1988 as a left guard.

Raymond Floyd, the defending Skins champion, is 47.  </P> <P> They will play nine holes Saturday and nine holes Sunday on the TPC's stadium  course for a designated prize on each hole. If two or more players tie on a  hole, the prize is carried over to the next hole.  </P> <P> Strange, winner of the U.S. Open in 1988 and '89, will be looking for his first  dollar in the event after being skinned last year.

Charles has earned $592,390 with two tournaments  remaining, Ojai Valley and the GTE Kaanapali event Dec. 7-9 at Lahaina, Hawaii  (on the island of Maui).  </P> <P> After a two-day pro-am Nov. 28-29, the 72 senior professionals will play 54  holes for $350,000. Harold Henning of South Africa is the defending champion,  and the field will include Arnold Palmer, Billy Casper, Gene Littler and Don  January, as well as Charles, Moody and Rodriguez.  </P> <P> Trevino, who missed becoming eligible to play at Ojai by one day, will have to  wait until the following week to join the seniors.  </P> <P> Nicklaus will enter the senior ranks Jan. 27-28 in the Seniors Skins Game in  Hawaii.  </P> <P> Twenty-four of the best collegiate men's and women's teams in the country will  play this week in the Pioneer Electronics Bruin Desert tournament at the  Mission Hills complex in Rancho Mirage.  </P> <P> The festivities begin today with a pro-am that includes LPGA pros Amy Alcott,  honorary coach of the Bruins, and two recent UCLA graduates -- Kay Cockerill  and Kristal Parker. The three-day event will start Monday.  </P> <P> Heading the women's field will be freshman Brandie Burton of Arizona State,  recent winner of the Tulsa and Stanford Invitationals; senior Jean Zeditz of  host UCLA, a first-team All-American last year and winner of the BYU and Oregon  Invitationals this year, and Pat Hurst and Dina Ammaccapane, who helped San  Jose State win the NCAA championship last season.  </P> <P> First-year coach Dave Atchison and his UCLA squad are favored in the men's  division.

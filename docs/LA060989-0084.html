			<p><P> June 9, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Israel has rejected a Syrian offer to exchange the body of an Israeli soldier  for 21 Palestinian fighters held in Israeli jails, Israeli and Palestinian  sources say. Defense Ministry officials would not comment on the report. The  sources said Syria offered to return the body of Sgt. Samir Assad, one of six  missing Israeli soldiers, in exchange for 21 guerrillas from the Palestine  Liberation Organization's mainstream Fatah faction who were captured when  Israeli forces attacked their boat off the Lebanese coast last year. Israel had  reported that only seven guerrillas survived, but the sources said 21 were  captured alive. In 1985, Israel exchanged 1,150 Palestinian prisoners for three  captive Israeli soldiers. But the lopsided swap was condemned in Israel, and  there has been no such exchange since.  </P></p>

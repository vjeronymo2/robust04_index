			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / SFO is backed over Nadir THE Serious Fraud Office has surmounted the first legal hurdle in its attempt to win reinstatement against Mr Asil Nadir, former chairman of Polly Peck International, of 46 charges thrown out by the trial judge. The High Court yesterday rejected Mr Nadir's contention that it had no jurisdiction to review Mr Justice Tucker's decision last month to dismiss the charges, which alleged the theft of Pounds 119m from PPI. Mr Nadir, whose trial is fixed for next March, may appeal to the law lords. The SFO says Mr Justice Tucker's decision was wrong in law, and if accepted would amount to 'a fraudster's charter'. The argument in the case must now await a Lords ruling in an action involving the same point of law. The dismissed charges alleged theft by the transfer of funds from PPI's bank accounts to accounts of Unipac, PPI's Turkish-Cypriot subsidiary, or Industrial Bank of Kibris, a northern Cyprus bank owned by Mr Nadir. Mr Justice Tucker said Mr Nadir was authorised by PPI to make transfers, and decided that the transfers in question had been merely preparatory acts not involving misappropriation. He said there was, however, evidence that the subsequent withdrawal of the funds from the Unipac and IBK accounts was unauthorised. The SFO contends that the judge erred in holding that Mr Nadir was authorised to make the transfers in circumstances where they were made, not for PPI's purposes, but for the dishonest purpose of then transferring funds to himself or his private interests. After dismissing 46 of the 66 charges against Mr Nadir, Mr Justice Tucker allowed the SFO to substitute 44 others which allege thefts from Unipac. The SFO plans to present an indictment containing 16 specimen charges of theft against Mr Nadir at the trial. At present, 10 of the 16 relate to alleged thefts from Unipac. If the SFO wins on review and has the dismissed charges restored, the charges at trial will all allege thefts from PPI.</p>

			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Management: Standing firm under fire - The Cadbury Committee is under pressure over its plans to reform corporate governance. Christopher Lorenz assesses the arguments Recalcitrant top executives in Britain should not count their chickens. Contrary to what they may have heard a week ago, before its latest meeting, the Cadbury Committee on the financial aspects of corporate governance is now unlikely to backslide on the substance of two of its most important proposals. But nor should advocates of better governance relax. They still need to reinforce the committee's resolve - and to warn boardroom dinosaurs that the alternative to Cadbury's mild proposals will be the imposition of tough regulation. That, in a nutshell, is the delicately-balanced situation facing opponents and supporters of the committee's proposals as, over the next two months, its members try to decide which proposals should be amended  - rather than merely reworded - in the light of the many responses to the draft code which was issued in May. Some bodies have complained that various proposals are excessive, others - notably institutional shareholders - that they are far too puny. At this stage, only one thing seems sure from talking privately to members of the committee, including radicals: that, despite all the flak it has suffered from both sides, it still wants to try to foster a consensus in support of its proposals - or, at least, in compliance with them. The committee is therefore unlikely to toughen up many of its proposals before the finalised code is published in December. This is in spite of the fact that most are extremely mild compared with the governance regulations which either already exist in the US, or are being proposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Instead, moves are afoot to spark the creation of some sort of continuous Cadbury review mechanism over the next two years, which could lead to changes during that period in response to corporate behaviour. Originally, the committee proposed merely a review period after that time. Two of the Cadbury proposals have created a particular stir. The first, supported strongly by the Stock Exchange, is the one which gives the draft most bite (the only one, some critics would argue): that a new listing requirement should oblige companies to declare the extent to which they comply with the code. Where they do not comply, they would have to explain why. Since this compliance statement would be in each company's annual report, it would give shareholders the right to raise the whole subject in detail at annual general meetings. That is precisely why some top managers oppose the idea. It is why certain members of the Confederation of British Industry persuaded their organisation to object to the proposal on the grounds of 'bureaucracy', despite the fact that the CBI's representative on the committee had already supported it. With typical tact, the committee's chairman, Sir Adrian Cadbury, has instead attributed the CBI's opposition to a misplaced fear that the code's clauses would themselves be enforceable. To most people, the difference may seem a fine one. But it is actually rather more than that, since it enables the committee to state honestly, in the best (or worst) tradition of British self-regulation, that compliance with the code's contents is voluntary. To remove any risk of further misunderstanding about the compliance requirement, the wording surrounding it is likely to be changed in the final Cadbury code - but not the requirement itself. The second most controversial proposal is that non-executive directors should 'monitor' the activities of directors. The noisiest objector here has been the Institute of Directors, which has complained that this would split the board into two interest groups. It has also been argued that this would, in effect, create a two-tier board - a notion which is always held to be anathema to most British top managers, on the grounds that it would open the door to the European Commission's hated employee-directors. The Cadbury Committee is perfectly aware that, in reality, a growing number of large company boards in the UK has a majority of non-executive directors, who also form either the majority or the entirety of the board's remuneration and audit committees. So they are already, in a sense, on the way to being two-tier. In its response to Cadbury, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland wisely advocated much greater debate about the virtues of two-tierdom. Yet, in the interests of consensus, the committee is likely to skirt this issue. It will tone down the wording of its 'monitoring' proposal, and make a declaration of continued faith in the ability of board members to play a proper supervisory role within a unitary structure. For the same reason of consensus-building, and also because its remit was supposedly too narrowly financial, the committee is unlikely to take much account of the widespread complaint that it is being far too soft on two of the hottest issues of all: the bases on which top pay packages are both decided and disclosed (or not, as is most often the case). Unlike in the US, where the SEC proposed rigorous and detailed new disclosure rules three months ago, the issue will be left to fester for many another day. And fester it certainly will. In many companies, directors are losing their bonuses, and the average rise in their pay packages has at last moderated - though often not as sharply as for other managers. A few companies are still producing headline-grabbing rises in top pay packages which, as at recession-bucking WH Smith this week, are harder to judge - and condemn - than they at first appear. But in far too many other companies, the value of top packages is still climbing out of all proportion to the company's performance - or not falling sharply enough with it. The British Institute of Management has rightly complained about this sort of thing: leaving aside the resentment it causes among less favoured managers and other employees, the most obvious short-term outcome will be increasing annoyance among shareholders. As with some of the other issues which the Cadbury Committee has chosen to duck for tactical reasons, the probable medium-term result will be a growing political impetus in favour of US-style regulation. The only way out will be for the committee or its successor body, plus the many financial institutions which say they support Cadbury, to use the next two years to shame boards into doing what is in their companies' best interest: behaving more sensibly.</p>

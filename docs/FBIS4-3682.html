			<p>BFN     [Text] Ashgabat, April 22 (XINHUA) -- Chinese officials  accompanying Premier Li Peng on his visit here held talks with  two deputy prime ministers of Turkmenistan on bilateral  political and economic relations.    Deputy Prime Minister Boris Shikhmuradov [title as  received],  in political talks with Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Dai  Bingguo, called Li Peng's visit to Turkmenistan "very  successful".    He spoke highly of Li's keynote speech on China's policy  towards Central Asia, which was delivered at the parliament of  Uzbekistan. Turkmenistan would never do anything to hurt China's  interests, he pledged.    The two officials voiced satisfaction with the close  cooperation between the foreign offices of the two countries.  They expected to maintain regular consultations, dialogue and  cooperation on regional and international issues, according to a  Chinese spokesman.    Turkmenistan has decided to set up an embassy in Beijing at  an early date, as a way to augment bilateral ties, the deputy  prime minister said.    Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Jorakuly Babakulyev held  talks with Chinese Vice Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic  Cooperation Liu Shanzai.    Liu said Li's visit has "strongly boosted" the development  of  bilateral economic cooperation.    Speaking of mutually-complimentary economies and vast  potentials for cooperation, Liu said Turkmenistan is rich in  oil, gas and cotton, of which China is in need, and Chinese  products are welcome here.    The Chinese entrepreneurs travelling with Premier Li Peng  signed a total of 12 documents on cooperation with Turkmenistan,  Liu said, adding he expects the two sides to make further  studies so as to "turn the letters of intent into reality."    Babakulyev said he expected enterprises of Turkmenistan and  China to cooperate in silk making and in banking.</p>

			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Parliament and Politics: Lloyd's underwriter forced to quit AN UNDERWRITER appointed by Lloyd's to investigate record losses at the insurance market has been forced to leave the market after misjudging his own syndicate's losses. Mr David King resigned as underwriter of marine syndicate 745 earlier this month after the extent of his losses for 1990 became apparent. On Monday, Mr King gave up his position on a three-member Lloyd's 'loss review' team investigating the losses in 1988 and 1989 of Rose Thomson Young syndicate 255. The team is one of seven set up to look into the reasons for recent losses. Overall these amounted to Pounds 510m in 1988 and Pounds 2.06bn in 1989. Mr King, now in his early 60s, has had 45 years experience at Lloyd's and was widely regarded as a successful underwriter. In 1990 more than 20 per cent of the syndicate's 1,743 Names - the individuals whose assets support underwriting at Lloyd's - worked with agents or brokers at the market, a much higher proportion than average, indicating that Mr King was widely respected among his peers. His syndicate, managed by KPH Underwriting Agencies, was a market leader in the reinsurance market, specialising in the same 'spiral' business which has left syndicates managed by Feltrim, Devonshire, Gooda Walker and Rose Thomson Young agencies with multi-million pound losses. In spiral reinsurance, underwriters with syndicates and companies reinsure each other's exposure to high-level loss. Reviews into the Gooda Walker and Feltrim losses, completed over the past month, have laid the blame on poor underwriting, inadequate reinsurance and weak management controls. Although syndicate 745's losses in 1988 and 1989 were relatively small, Mr King appears to have misjudged his exposure in 1990 to claims from the January storms and was unaware of the potential size of losses until an internal review in August this year. Syndicate managers now estimate total losses for 1990 to be between 90 per cent and 140 per cent of the syndicate's capacity (or capital base) of Pounds 43.1m, way in excess of earlier estimates. Embarrassingly for Lloyd's, syndicate 745 could itself become the subject of a loss review, since such reviews are normally triggered when losses exceed 90 per cent of capacity. According to Mr Andrew Elliott, who has taken over as underwriter of syndicate 745, Mr King underestimated his potential exposure to non-marine losses. Following Hurricane Hugo and a series of other losses in late 1989, the Lloyd's market was in a state of turmoil and many of the syndicates re-insured by syndicate 745 changed the mix of business underwritten.</p>

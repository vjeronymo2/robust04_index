			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Articles by various reporters: "Results Of City Council </F> Elections"]    [Text]  <H5>  "Predictions Confirmed" by Guntis Kokars, JURMALA, special </H5> to LABRIT    In almost all electoral districts in Jurmala on election day  people most often mentioned two lists: "Our Jurmala," in which  the LNIM [Latvian National Independence Movement] and the  citizens group "Our Land" were united, and "Prosperity," which  included representatives of LW [Latvia's Way], the Harmony of  People party and the SDLP [Social Democratic Labor Party of  Latvia]. Election predictions were confirmed: "Our Jurmala"  gained six seats in the council. "Prosperity" gained three  seats. The rest were alloted thus: DP [Democratic Party,  formerly Democratic Center Party]--two; and one each to united  FFF [For Fatherland and Freedom] and the CDU [Christian  Democratic Union] list, the united PFL [Popular Front of Latvia]  and AP [Agrarian Party] list, and to the political organization  "Proprietor".    Most popular among the voters was the doctor Leopolds  Ozolins. It is possible that his placement in the "number one"  position gave "Our Land" so many seats. Of nationally known and  familiar persons, Andrejs Inkulis, former deputy chairman of the  Riga city council, who represented "Prosperity," was also  elected. From FFF the most popular turned out to be the singer  and composer Adrians Kukuvass.    No list won a majority of the vote, which is why a coalition  is expected to be established. If "Our Jurmala" forms a  coalition with FFF and the CDU, then it is possible that Ligita  Zacesta, who already is the acting chair of the Jurmala Council  of Peoples' Deputies, would become the mayor of Jurmala. The  popular Leopolds Ozolins has said that he will not be a  candidate for the office of mayor. Already during the election  campaign "Prosperity" named as its mayoral candidate Janis  Armicans, but with only three votes this idea will be difficult  to realize. It is possible that the deputies will agree and  elect someone from a neutral list. That might be the Jurmala  municipal autosport enterprise director Juris Visockis, who is a  member of the DP.  <H5>  "Harmony of People Party Victory" by Santa Belinska </H5>   The hot election campaign period is over and a long awaited  silence has descended upon Daugavpils. The Harmony of People  party can celebrate victory, for it won ten seats in the new  city council out of 15. As expected, Aleksei Vidavskis, list  leader and deputy chairman of the state stock company "Dautex"  received the most voter support. Judging by articles in  newspapers he could also be the person who the townsfolk and  party members want to see in the post of mayor. About twenty  percent of voters cast their ballots for Aleksei Vidavskis. The  other council members elected from the Harmony of People party  are SIA "Austra" director Rita Strode, physician Reinits Joksts,  Social Assistance Center worker Andrejs Grave, insurance  association "Ezerzeme" president Peteris Savostjanovs, "Latvia's  Gas" Daugavpils affiliate director Viktors Gajevskis, state  revenue service inspector Natalija Semjonova, High School Nine  director Silvija Birjulina, enterprise "Lokomotivs" trade union  committee chairman Ivans Pucka and stock company "Dilars"  president Dmitrijs Sinders. The SDLP and the Democratic Party of  Latgale unified list got three seats in the city council. Those  go to the current city council chairman Valdis Lauskis, state  stock company "Dautex" director Janis Ambainis and city chief  architect Gertrude Kudina. Agrarian Union of Latvia candidate  Andrejs Dauksts and Social Democratic Party list member Aleksejs  Providenko, who has a highly controversial reputation in the  city, each emerged victorious. Before the election candidates on  the Harmony of People list said that they are willing to work  with all other lists on economic issues. The Daugavpils  elections commission will submit its list of the new city  council to the Central Elections Commission, which will have to  rule on the level of state language comprehension for three  council members before they can take office.  <H5>  "It's All Clear to One--Others Somewhat Confused" by Marina </H5> Marinina    Seven members of the Popular Front, three Democratic Party  list "We for Liepaja" members, two Association of Nationalist  Organizations members and one each from "For Fatherland and  Freedom," the Democratic Labor Party and the Liepaja  Entrepreneurs Association were elected to the Liepaja city  council. Although the Popular Fronters did not win the one  additional seat needed to govern absolutely, Janis Birzkops,  chair of the Liepaja section of the PFL [Popular Front of  Latvia], the first person on the victorious list, and now also  the likely head of the city, does not anticipate any obstacles  to the work of the resulting Liepaja council. Despite the  agreement of intent already concluded with FFF at the level of a  protocol, Mr. Birzkops still hopes to work with the LNIM,  similar to what is being discussed in Riga.    FFF section chair Arkadijs Zebergs confirmed yesterday that  Janis Gailis, former Home Guard batallion commander, now  landlord, construction company owner, and the Fatherlander  elected to the council, supports the PFL orientation, and for  his part Valdis Prancans, Association of Nationalist  Organizations member, said that both deputies from his list--the  doctor Egils Deksnis for the Christian Democrats and Vilnis  Maulins from the LNIM--will, for the time being, remain in the  opposition. Similarly, he predicted that "We for Liepaja" would  be in opposition to the Popular Fronters.    Ivars Lagzdins, who submitted this list, looking at the  seven  council seats he considered should have been his and that  certainly Andris Jaunsleinis should have been elected,  acknowledged that the Popular Front phenomenon in Liepaja  surprised him somewhat and that predicting the future is truly  difficult at this moment. We were unable to contact "We For  Liepaja" deputy Teodors Enins, but the other two, Inese  Liepniece, Liepaja Commerce Bank board chair, and Janis  Dreiblats, Liepaja Theatre director, acknowledged that they  neither expected nor particularly wanted to get onto the  council, but Mr. Dreiblats was pleasantly surprised by his  popularity among the city's inhabitants. They declined to  discuss the future for the time being. Liepaja Entrepreneurs  Association director Janis Spriedejs was hopeful that he sees no  reason that his deputy, Music College director Rihards Rubins,  could not cooperate with the Popular Fronters.    Mr. Birzkops did express a bit of regret that a  representative of producers was not elected from the LEA  [Liepaja Entrepreneurs Association], because the council does  not have anyone like that, but that does not mean that he has  any claim against his former schoolmate, Mr. Rubins. When asked  about a possible opposition, for example, from the "We For  Liepaja" side, Mr. Birzkops answered that he views opposition  with skepticism, for people normally argue only because they are  missing a clear conception of various things. As for "We For  Liepaja," they are former Popular Fronters and all are honorable  and sensible people with whom it is possible to work in a team  in the the name of Liepaja's interests, [he said].    The possibility of cooperating with the PFL and "We For  Liepaja" has not been completely ruled out by the Fatherlanders  either, despite their undisguised worries, but arguments against  it have already begun to appear. Time will tell whether or not  they are won over.  <H5>  "A Convincing Victory" by Valda Madalane </H5>   Even though only four lists battled in the municipal  election  for seats on the Rezekne city council, the final results came  slowly, although they could have been predicted well in  advanced. Monday morning it became known that a convincing  number of seats--six--had been won by "Rezekne's Proprietor"  (Ernests Jurkans, Vladimirs Cvetkovs, Helmuts Cibulis, Vilmars  Stanislavs Jukna, Irena Silinevica, Janis Zudans). Two seats  each went to the National Power Association of Latvia (Janis  Novaksanovs and Janis Visockis) and to the Harmony of People  party (Viktors Reblis and Valentina Sidlovska) and one to the  Democratic Party of Latgale (Jazeps Korsaks). The simplest  mathematical computations show unmistakably that leader  affilitations alone do not create the prerequisites for real  coalition creation. Such a viewpoint is also expressed by newly  elected Rezekne city council deputy V. Reblis and he adds that  in this kind of situation it is pointless to seek the office of  city mayor. In turn "Rezekne's Proprietor" member H. Cibulis  clarified that the list leader usually nominates the candidate  for mayor. So: Ernests Jurkans? The future of the city will be  determined by six entrepreneurial and energy branch  representatives, three doctors and two educators.  <H5>  "Expectations--Moderate" by Zane Matulena </H5>   In the elections for the Jelgava council the 15 seats were  divided as follows: LNIM (six seats), SDLP (2), DP (2), AU (2),  FFF (2), LW [Latvia's Way] (1). Yesterday afternoon we contacted  various list members elected to seats on the Jelgava city  council. They could only express their own personal views about  possible coalitions and candidates for mayor, because  consultations within the local sections of the parties and  movements, as well as the mutual consultations of those on the  lists still had not occurred. LNIM Jelgava section member A.  Burba said that the key to building a coalition will be the  people who end up in the council from the other lists.  Cooperation is possible with two new councilmen from the AU  list. One of them, it is possible, will be the Jelgava city  chief physician, U. Cacus, who in a telephone conversation  acknowledged that he has received an unofficial offer to work  with LNIM representatives on the council. Of course it will be  concretely decided by the leadership of the Agrarian Union's  regional section. The LNIM representative emphasized that he was  expressing his personal thoughts, calling as a potential city  council chair the current Jelgava city municipal leader, LNIM  member Uldis Ivans. Equally reserved in his predictions was the  current city commerce director R. Vitolins.    Last night the Jelgava section of "Latvia's Way" held a  meeting. A resolution was adopted that for the time being the  movement will be neutral and wait to see who will be nominated  to the post of mayor by others. If a compromise is not reached  "Latvia's Way" will be prepared to offer one of their members.  J. Abele, Jelgava section coordinator for "Latvia's Way," said  that to resolve actual issues in his city it would be better to  be part of the ruling coalition, though it is possible that they  find themselves in the opposition. Unfortunately we were unable  to find out the thoughts of "For Fatherland and Freedom," the  Democratic Party or the SDLP yesterday. These lists will also be  represented in the city council.</p>

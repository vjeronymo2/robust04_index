			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In Geneva, the UN Human Rights Commission special  rapporteur on Iraq, Max van der Stoel, has presented to the  Commission his report on the human rights situation in that  country. He then gave a news conference. From Geneva, Roy  Brunton.    [Brunton] Max van der Stoel has been special rapporteur on  Iraq for three years. This report, he said, is a landmark. For  the first time a Commission report has named two individuals and  accused them of holding, quote, the most responsibility of a  special and individual nature for serious human rights  violations, unquote. The two persons named are Iraqi President  Saddam Husayn and his cousin 'Ali Hasan al-Majid, the minister  of defense. Both men hold several other positions in the  hierarchy of power in Iraq.    In addition to accusing them of crimes against the peace,  such as the invasion of Kuwait, the report says that serious  violations of human rights against the population of Iraq, both  in times of war and peace, involved crimes against humanity  committed under and pursuant to their orders. As an example it  cites the use of chemical weapons against numerous Kurdish  communities in northern Iraq.    Max van der Stoel was asked whether he thought President  Saddam Husayn ultimately should stand trial for crimes against  humanity.    [Begin van der Stoel recording] One thing is clear, that is  the responsibility, that the concentration of power is such that  there is no decision of any importance for which he doesn't  (?currently) have direct responsibility. To give you one  example, in 10 days during the [word indistinct] campaign he  signed 500 death sentences, so that shows that he has a very  direct responsibility and the whole structure is such that the  real power is concentrated in the so-called Revolution Command  Council, and in the Revolution Command Council President Saddam  plays the key role and in fact the decisive role. [end  recording]    [Brunton] The report says President Saddam Husayn must be  considered directly responsible for the Iraqi population's  present suffering, this due to his refusal to comply with the UN  Security Council resolution under which Iraq would export oil  with some of the proceeds being used for purchase of imported  basic necessities.    It also accuses him of being responsible for driving the  population out of the southern marshes by depriving them of the  means to sustain themselves as a result of the draining of the  marshes in which they have lived for generations.    Among annexes to the report are copies of official letters  sent to the authorities as routine. One refers to an illiterate  nine-year-old girl blamed by officials for subversive activities  with a warrant issued for her arrest. Another letter concerns  the killing and decapitation of a mentally retarded man  described as an Iranian agent. The letter says the squad that  killed him took his head to the General Directorate of Security.  Roy Brunton, Geneva.</p>

			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Survey of Malta (4): A pivot in the strategy - Financial services The development of Malta as an international financial and trading centre is a pivotal element in the Nationalist government's strategy for economic development. Financial services are seen as an important new source of income and employment, providing a qualitative change in the nature of the services sector of the economy. Legislation, due to be approved by parliament by the end of March, should provide the necessary framework for expanding the modest financial services structure set up in 1989. According to Mr John Dalli, the finance minister, within five years financial services could account for 10 to 15 per cent of GDP. This sector could provide some 6,000 more jobs, becoming the single largest outlet for graduate employment. Indeed, the upgrading of the islands' labour skills is specifically tailored to the successful expansion of financial services. Malta is not the first small island economy to try to seek salvation by developing financial services. If anything, it has come to the idea late in the day when the supply of financial service centres outstrips demand, making success that much tougher. Mr Dalli has few illusions about the challenge. 'We have set ourselves a tall order,' he says. However, the Maltese authorities have some important selling points which make them quietly optimistic. The present government has been slow but extremely methodical in preparing the ground. This applies both to ensuring Malta possesses the right educational levels to meet the demand for professional skills and to laying the essential telecommunications and communications infrastructure. High priority has been given to expanded university enrolment and improving the nature of the courses available. The university this year has reached a student population of 5,000. Within six years the government has achieved its target of having 20 per cent of school-leavers opt for tertiary education. Infrastructural development has received a substantial injection of funds. Thus the Malta telecoms authority now has in place state-of-the-art optic fibre and satellite facilities capable of handling the sophisticated telecommunications needs of the financial services business. Parallel with these developments, the authorities have opted to begin in a modest way. In 1989 the Maltese International Business Authority was set up to supervise and administer fledgling offshore activities. 'We were not looking for brass plate operations,' says Mr Dalli. 'We wanted to establish our reputation as a serious centre, not as a tax haven.' To critics who claim that relatively few international companies have used this Maltese facility, he replies that Malta has been very careful in vetting entries. During the past five years, the MIBA has registered 1,300 companies. However, no fewer than 5,000 applications have been rejected. During this period, the MIBA also registered three onshore banks, three insurance companies and 28 trusts; while 50 nominee companies have been granted warrants to service offshore companies. The 1988 white paper on International Business Activities stated that the ultimate aim was virtually to eliminate the distinction between onshore and offshore activities and be fully compatible with EU directives. The government has now hired Peat Marwick, the international accountants, as consultant for this new and complex phase. The preparatory activity is over and legislation is now before parliament to transform the MIBA into the Malta Financial Services Centre. The MFSC will have the functions of the single financial services regulator for investment business and insurance. By adopting a 'one-stop-shop' approach, the investor service should be both more attractive and efficient. At the same time, the government is harmonising and simplifying its tax legislation, the biggest single fiscal shake-up since independence. A special international unit is being set up in the Inland Revenue to deal with the tax matters of international investors. Among the tax privileges envisaged is special treatment for Maltese-registered holdings in overseas companies. Other elements of the legislative package underline just how much ground the authorities have had to cover so as to create the right environment for the MFSC. The legislation includes: the recognition of unit trusts governed by foreign tax laws and managed in Malta, in accordance with the Hague Convention on the Recognition of Trusts; a professional secrecy bill; an insider trading bill; an investment services bill; companies and commercial partnerships legislation; and a money laundering bill. The latter bill boldly states: 'In opening its doors to the international financial community, Malta does not want to become a conduit for money derived from drug traffic and other serious crime.' The aim is to adopt regulations in line with EU directives. With Malta so close to Sicily and Calabria, the abuse of the system by Italian organised crime is a real threat. Who then is likely to make use of the MFSC? Mr Dalli believes existing European onshore/offshore centres such as Luxembourg and the Channels Islands are becoming too crowded and expensive, so there is scope to pick up business. Peat Marwick sees Malta as having low-cost advantages relating to wages and property. Property in particular is abundant and is priced below the European norm; while the competitive edge in wage costs is important given Malta's English-based multi-lingualism. Malta could become an attractive alternative centre for fund administration. It might prove competitive in some labour intensive aspects of banking. The Maltese also hope for some spin-off on the financial services side from existing activity in ship registrations. Malta currently has the world's tenth largest shipping register.</p>

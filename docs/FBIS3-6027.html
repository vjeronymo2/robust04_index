			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Tokyo TV Asahi Network in Japanese at  0108 GMT on 6 March, during its weekly "Sunday Project" panel  discussion program, carries a 47-minute live political debate  including Tsutomu Hata, president of Shinseito (Japan Renewal  Party), Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the Social Democratic  Party of Japan (SDPJ), and Keigo Ouchi, chairman of the  Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), in Asahi's Tokyo studio, and  by Komeito Chairman Koshiro Ishida in Osaka linked by remote  hookup. Political commentator Soichiro Tawara acts as  moderator, and two guest commentators -- Kyoto University  Professor Masaaki Kosaka and journalist Hajime Takeno -- are  also asked to give their views.    The first 17 minutes of the debate are devoted to the recent  political turmoil over a failed cabinet reshuffle plan by Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. In the discussions, Hata and Ishida  admit they had supported Hosokawa's plan to fire Chief Cabinet  Secretary Masayoshi Takemura from his post. But Murayama and  Ouchi insist the plan was ill-conceived, and add it was good for  the unity of the coalition that the plan was discarded.    At 0125 GMT, the topic turns to the question of political  realignment. Tawara says he believes that, from the time of the  disagreement over the cabinet reshuffle incident, the coalition  has been divided into two power centers -- Shinseito, Komeito  and Hosokawa's Japan New Party on the one hand, and the DSP, the  SDPJ, and Takemura's Sakigake (Harbinger Party) on the other.  He then asks Murayama of the SDPJ if the coalition will  continue to exist in in a two-group format. Murayama replies,  "It so happened that the views (of the SDPJ, the DSP, and  Sakigake) matched on the question of the national welfare tax  and on the issue of the cabinet reshuffle, and there were  agreements on ways to ensure coalition stability and solidifying  cooperation." He insists, "This condition has not been  intentionally created to counter the Shinseito-Komeito bloc, as  alleged by some people."    Tawara asks Ishida of Komeito if the coalition parties, in  the face of the next general election, will eventually merge  into one party or cooperate with each other while retaining  their identities as separate parties. Ishida says the parties  are "not yet in a condition of being able to accommodate other  parties' positions" and to bring themselves together under one  umbrella. Ishida, however, suggests all coalition member  parties should move toward gathering together under one  umbrella, insisting, "The election system requires that we move  toward a two-party system." He notes that the "Liberal  Democratic Party (LDP) is a big opposition party with more than  220 seats in the lower house."    Asked a similar question, Murayama of the SDPJ says, "The  parties should cooperate (in the next general election) to  ensure that the LDP does not return to power," but he says the  cooperation does not mean that all the parties should merge into  one force. Murayama says such a merger would be "impossible."    At 0134 GMT, Ouchi of the DSP is asked to express his view  on  the issue of future political alignment. Ouchi says, "Political  alignment really means forming new parties. All parties should  make all possible efforts toward that end." However, noting  that a failure to win in the next election could be a  "catastrophe" for the coalition, he says the parties should not  try to seek to form a single force at once from the beginning.  He insists, "people who hold cautious stands and people aiming  for higher targets should form parties of their own at first."  He also says that in the next general election the coalition  parties should do all they can to maintain the coalition  government by cooperating with each other. He adds that one  preferable way would be for the eight existing political groups  in the coalition to merge into two or three parties, and for  them to cooperate in the next election.    Asked to give his views, Hata of Shinseito says, "It is  important for all the parties to make endeavors to become one  group," noting "we -- the parties of different backgrounds and  political ideals -- have been able to surmount all the  difficulties arising from these differences, and to maintain the  coalition over the past seven months." Hata says the parties  should either merge into one big party or form a single joint  floor group in the Diet.    Asked about reports that Komeito and Shinseito are heading  for a merger, Ishida of Komeito asserts the reports are not  correct. He says his party wants to create a new party which  includes all other parties in the coalition.    At 0148 GMT, guest commentators -- Professor Kosaka and  journalist Takeno -- are asked to give their comments on the  views of the four political party leaders. With the debate  coming to close, Tawara brings up the question of the cabinet  reshuffle once again. Recalling that one of the reasons people  did not support Prime Minister Hosokawa's idea on a cabinet  reshuffle was the "bad timing" of the announcement of the plan,  with the 1994 budget yet to be cleared by the Diet. Tawara asks  Ouchi of the DSP if a reshuffle would be possible once the Diet  completes deliberations on the 1994 budget. Ouchi says, "Common  sense tells me that if he wants to reshuffle the cabinet, he  should do it after the regular session of the Diet closes and  major bills have been taken care of." Murayama, Hata, and  Ishihara also express similar views.</p>

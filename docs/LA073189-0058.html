			<p><P> July 31, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOOTNOTES: IT USED TO BE GREATER  </P> <P> It's official. The Greater Los Angeles Visitors and Convention Bureau is now  the Los Angeles Convention and Visitors Bureau.  </P> <P> What does all this mean? Not too much, as it turns out. The title was changed  to be more consistent with other bureaus, the nonprofit tourism and convention  promoter noted.  </P> <P> "The name change does not reflect any change in marketing thrust or decreased  interest in promoting and serving members outside the Los Angeles city limits,"  President Bill F. Miller said.  </P> <P> Because a new logo is in the works, the bureau has yet to spring for new  stationery, business cards and the like. Staffers are making do with the old  stuff or are executing their own redesign with a ballpoint pen.  </P> <P> Pain and Gain for Soviets  </P> <P> First they agree to dismantle missiles. Then they talk about withdrawing troops  from Europe. And now the Soviets are eager to study aerobics?  </P> <P> It's true. In a nation where for years the only people to "feel the burn" were  dissident authors as they watched their works go up in the smoke, there is now  talk -- thanks to glasnost, Reebok and two Los Angeles promoters -- of a drive  to make aerobics the national participatory sport. Only two months ago, the  Soviets were first exposed to aerobics with a tour by the Reebok National  Aerobic Champions, a U.S. team organized by Karen and Howard Schwartz of Los  Angeles, inventors in 1983 of competitive aerobics.  </P> <P> This week, a Soviet team selected and trained by the Schwartzes is in town --  signing up as the 10th member of the International Competitive Aerobic  Federation and, not incidentally, generating publicity for Reeboks (which  aren't for sale in the U.S.S.R.). When the team returns home, Howard Schwartz  says, Soviet officials expect them to train aerobic instructors from Riga to  Vladivostok, in hopes of whipping the nation's couch pirogi into shape.  </P> <P> Casey Is Still at Bat  </P> <P> Casey Stengel has been dead for 14 years, but he's still pinch-hitting for a  pinstriped team in Glendale.  </P> <P> Valley National Bank, a Glendale-based bank that the colorful baseball manager  and relatives founded in 1957, is running local newspaper advertisements that  feature Stengel's picture to draw attention to the bank.  </P> <P> Valley National recently hired an ad agency that "thought it might be a good  idea" to highlight the bank's connection with Stengel, especially during the  baseball season, said bank President Joseph H. Valentine.  </P> <P> Stengel, whose full name was Charles Dillon Stengel, managed the New York  Yankees to 10 pennants and seven world titles between 1949 and 1960.  </P> <P> Was Stengel's estate paid a royalty for the ad? Declining to take a full swing  at the question, Valentine said a "token amount" likely was offered, but that  the estate "probably waived the fee."  </P></p>

			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / International Company News: BZ fund buys stake in Glaxo Pharma Vision 2000, the activist investment fund controlled by Mr Martin Ebner's BZ financial group, has acquired 5m shares in Glaxo, the world's second largest pharmaceuticals group. Pharma Vision, known for its large holdings in Roche, the Swiss healthcare group, said Glaxo fitted well with its preference for companies that have a research-intensive strategy. 'It has an even stronger focus on the development and manufacture of pharmaceutical products than Roche. No other company devotes such large financial and human resources to pharmaceutical research,' Mr Christoph Blocher, chairman, said in his interim report published on Friday. Mr Blocher noted that the patent situation on Glaxo's most successful product - Zantac, an anti-ulcer drug - was unclear, but 'our assumption is that revenues from the company's new products will, in the medium term, more than offset the expected loss of income from Zantac'. He hinted that Pharma Vision could well raise its Glaxo stake, valued at SFr56.4m (Dollars 42.7m) at the end of June, once it had seen the impact of recent management changes. Meanwhile, Pharma Vision again raised its holdings of Roche securities in the first half. At June 30, it held 200,000 bearer shares worth SFr2.54bn, up from 135,000 at the end of 1993, and 160,000 dividend right certificates worth SFr1.02bn, up from 155,000. Its total holdings in Roche, including options, represented 91.7 per cent of its portfolio at the end of June. It sold part of its holding in Ciba, the Swiss pharmaceuticals and chemicals group, during the first half and said the rest would be sold during the second half. Pharma Vision said in February that it did not agree with Ciba's diversification strategy. The fund's net asset value at the end of June stood at SFr3.47bn compared with SFr2.86bn at the end of 1993, due mainly to the SFr530m proceeds of a February rights issue. The net asset value per share rose marginally to SFr4,653 from SFr4,606 over the same period.</p>

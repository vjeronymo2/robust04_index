			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Eurotunnel in focus as CAC 40 meets resistance at 1,800 BOURSES were initially encouraged by Tokyo, but many failed to hold on to the day's gains. Milan, Madrid, Stockholm, Helsinki and Vienna were closed for Epiphany, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS continued its New Year rally but the CAC 40 index failed to break decisively through 1,800. It closed at 1,787.57, up 17.27 but off the day's high of 1,802.50. Turnover was estimated at just under FFr2b, after Friday's FFr1.47bn, reflecting the return of fund managers from holiday. Among the day's most active stocks was the Anglo-French Eurotunnel, which rose FFr2.25 or 5.6 per cent to FFr42.20 with with 189,050 shares changing hands. Dealers said the stock jumped on a report in the French newspaper Agefi that Eurotunnel and TML, the consortium building the tunnel, had agreed to bury their differences on cost overruns. Eurotunnel was also buoyed up by reports that it had been fund managers as a likely outperformer in 1992. Paribas, one of the worst performers on a two-year view, was also mentioned in the poll, and the stock rose FFr6.50 to FFr334 in active trading for a gain of 7.8 per cent since January 2. FRANKFURT could not hold its early gains and the DAX index came back from an intraday high of 1,613.54 to close 0.30 lower at 1,603.32 after a decline of 0.59 to 652.60 in the FAZ at midsession. Worries that the US rally was unstable, and domestic economic fears were blamed for the weakness in sentiment. Dealers said that selling of DAX index futures, after hopes for a further DAX rise faded, had also prompted some cash market selling. Volume fell from DM3.8bn to DM3bn, reflecting the holiday in southern Germany. Gainers yesterday were mainly second-tier stocks, some after a period of weakness. Altana, hit later last year by litigation in its baby food business, recovered DM14.50 to DM579.50; Asko, down on its connections with the ailing Adia temporary employment group in Switzerland, closed DM6.50 higher at DM616.50. Among blue chips, the best gain was in the chemicals group, Bayer, up DM3 to DM287.90 on a large order. AMSTERDAM ended below the day's best as leading companies issued their traditional New Year messages. The CBS Tendency Index closed at 113.6, up 0.1 from Friday, but off the intraday high of 114.1. DAF eased 30 cents to Fl 21.30. After the close the truck manufacturer said that DAF said that it expected its losses to continue in the first half of 1990. Hoogovens rose Fl 1.70 to Fl 44.00 despite its forecast that 1992 will be another difficult year. ZURICH gave up some of its early gains, but the Credit Suisse index still closed 2.7 higher at 459.6, dealers reporting some buying by London-based institutional investors. Trading in blue chips was lively while activity in second-tier shares was subdued. Activity focused on the industrial sector, Roche certificates adding SFr30 to SFr2,750 and Ciba-Geigy bearers closing SFr30 firmer at SFr3,060. BRUSSELS continued to focus on the retailer Delhaize which rose BFr100 to BFr8,650 and accounted for one-fifth of the day's turnover of BFr666m. The Bel-20 index rose 1.43 to 1,104.53. The travel and tourism company Wagons-Lits, which is now 97 per cent owned by Accor of France, plunged BFr700 to BFr8,000 ahead of today's suspension from the forward market today. The stock will still be traded on the cash market. OSLO rallied for a fifth day in a row, the all-share index climbing 5.80, or 1.4 per cent to 432.87 although the close was well below the day's high of 437.78. Turnover was about NKr310m. Pessimism about the Norwegian economy has been toned down and the industry index, which includes stocks linked to North Sea oil, rose to 8.13 to 700.09 with Hafslund A frees rising by NKr6 to NKr271, and Aker A frees NKr4 better at NKr69. ISTANBUL rose by 2 per cent, partly on late demand for companies with high year-end profit expectations, the market index closing 87.28 higher at 4,410.22.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                     FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - JAN 6  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                           Hourly changes  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  Open     10 am    11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     Close 1096.23  1094.65  1093.44  1092.63  1092.19  1092.25  1091.90  1092.05  -----------------------------------------------------------------------         Day's High  1096.23            Day's Low  1091.02  -----------------------------------------------------------------------     Jan 3         Jan 2        Dec 31         Dec 30         Dec 27    1087.01       1078.19      1079.41++      1065.54        1055.30  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90). ++ Partial.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

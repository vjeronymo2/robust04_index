			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Letter: Economic success at right social cost Sir, I heartily endorse your view that 'high and rising unemployment is now the biggest problem facing all European governments, and their most urgent need is growth and job creation' ('Get Europe to work,' May 19), but would disagree equally strongly with your conclusion that this does not allow for measures of social protection. The real challenge for Europe is how to combine high levels of employment, economic success and high social standards. Popular political pressures make it impossible for Europe to seek to match the wage costs of its competitors in Asia and elsewhere by driving down living standards. The realistic course open to us is one based on high quality 'value-added' production, improved training, better use of resources and maximising our creative skills. But the support of Europe's working people for change depends on us having a solid base of social protection and a genuine all-Europe co-operative growth strategy. We won modest gains on this at the Edinburgh Summit, and have had very positive and practical discussions with the Danish government and the European Commission. This could set the country on a new and popular course. If it does, I am sure nobody will attack Jacques Delors for 'coming over and interfering with our unemployment'.

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by N. N. Kazanova, R. A. Bulgakova, Ye. I. </F> Kochetkova, and V. I. Stanko, Physical and Technical Problems  Institute, Moscow; UDC547.9:543.424]    [Abstract] During the past decade mumiye (MOV) has  attracted both practical and scientific interest as a substance  having healing properties. A requirement for the successful use  of this substance lies in the determination of its authenticity.  Mumiye is a complex biologically active substance having 60-80  percent organic matter. Its structure has not yet been  established, although it is known that the organic fraction  contains low molecular components such as benzoic and hippuric  acids and both oxy- and amino-acids, various oligomers  (peptides, carbohydrates) polymers, proteins, polysaccharides,  glycoproteins and their modifications, polyphenols, and others.  The nature of the biological activity of this substance has not  been determined and therefore its identification by content of  biologically active components has thus far been avoided. Taking  into account the extremely complex composition of mumiye and the  lack of reliable information on the composition and nature of  its biological activity, it is hypothesized that the most  expedient way to resolve the problem of identification of this  substance lies not in determining the quantitative content of  individual components, but rather in some integrated physical  chemical characterization of the substance as a whole,  especially spectral. In the present work a systematic study was  made of the infra-red spectra at 4000-400 cm[.sup]-1[/] of 50  standard samples of authentic natural mumiye from deposits in  Southwestern and Eastern Pamir, Eastern and Central Kazakhstan,  Altay, and Tuva. Spectral criteria were established for  identification of mumiye as a unique substance having a complex  composition. A method is proposed for determining the  authenticity of this substance from recommended spectral  criteria making it possible to reliably identify mumiye and  distinguish it from possible surrogates.

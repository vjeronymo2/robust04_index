			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> MONKEY BUSINESS: The Santa Ana Zoo isn't happy to have this monkey off its  back. The zoo has decided to say goodby to two very rare primates -- red-backed  squirrel monkeys -- and send them to Phoenix. . . . There, the two monkeys will  join a third friend recently captured, so the Phoenix Zoo can start the  nation's first captive-breeding program for the monkeys. Santa Ana Zoo  officials say it's their small way of helping out a species that has almost  vanished from the world. Jon Nalick and Mark Landsbaum  </P></p>

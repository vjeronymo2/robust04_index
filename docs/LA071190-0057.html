			<p><P> July 11, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REOPENING OF VA PSYCHIATRIC WARD QUESTIONED;  </P> <P> VETERAN AFFAIRS: SEN. CRANSTON ASKS AGENCY TO JUSTIFY ACTION AT LONG BEACH  CENTER WHERE FIVE PATIENTS COMMITTED SUICIDE.  </P> <P> U.S. Sen. Alan Cranston called Tuesday for the Department of Veterans Affairs  to justify the reopening of a psychiatric ward in Long Beach that had been  closed in the wake of five patient suicides.  </P> <P> The troubled ward at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Long Beach began  admitting patients again Monday after being closed for eight weeks, although a  federal inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the deaths is incomplete.  </P> <P> Cranston, chairman of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, asked for an  independent team of at least two psychiatrists unaffiliated with the VA system  to investigate the suicides, as well as the decision to accept patients again.  </P> <P> "Please provide a justification for the decision to reopen the ward while the  issues which initially warranted the closure are still under investigation,"  Cranston wrote in a letter to Anthony J. Principi, deputy secretary of the  Department of Veterans Affairs.  </P> <P> Officials in Washington and Long Beach, saying they had not yet seen the  letter, declined to comment. A spokeswoman in the VA's San Francisco regional  office, which oversees the Long Beach hospital, said the decision to reopen was  thoroughly reviewed and "very confidently made."  </P> <P> The letter, although worded evenhandedly, seemed intended to speed up a federal  inquiry that began in May after The Times reported the five suicides at the  hospital between March, 1989, and last April -- a number equal to the total  recorded by all five state-run psychiatric hospitals in two year.  </P> <P> Three men hanged themselves, one leaped from a hospital roof and the fifth shot  himself in the mouth after he was allegedly denied admission. Two of the  hangings occurred in the locked ward, designed to keep suicidal, homicidal,  violent or gravely disabled psychiatric patients under constant or  near-constant watch. One patient, a 27-year-old Marine, used the shoelaces from  his combat boots, which psychiatric nurses said he never should have had.  </P> <P> An investigation was ordered in May by Principi, second in command of the  Department of Veterans Affairs, which operates 172 hospitals nationwide. Two  inspectors spent nearly three weeks in May and June at the 1,368-bed Long Beach  facility, one of the largest hospitals in the system. A report has yet to be  completed.  </P> <P> Spokeswoman Donna St. John said the inspector general is already lining up  independent experts to review the suicides, a process that she said accounts  for the report's delay.  </P> <P> The hospital's medical director, Dean Stordahl, earlier expressed confidence in  the ward's ability to keep patients safe. He said the nursing staff has  undergone a six-week "team-building" training session, and the ward has been  upgraded with more secure windows and other security measures.  </P> <P> Once the training and renovations were complete, Dr. Arthur Lewis, acting chief  medical director of the Department of Veterans Affairs, ordered the ward  reopened, said Ruth Villasenor, spokeswoman for the San Francisco regional  office.  </P> <P> "Every step of the way, Long Beach represented to the western region what was  going on (concerning retraining and upgrading). Based on that, the go-ahead was  very confidently made," she said. "We are awaiting the results of the inspector  general's investigation, but that was not considered a basis to keeping a ward  like that closed."  </P> <P> During the eight weeks the ward was dark, only 19 of 82 patients were referred  to other VA hospitals. The rest were admitted to private psychiatric facilities  at a cost of $189,000, officials said.  </P> <P> Cranston expressed concern over whether the ward should have reopened at all  and has asked the regional office to "monitor (the hospital) actively."  </P></p>

			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Election 92: Viewers promised wide TV coverage LABOUR'S alternative Budget today will be followed this evening by a televised confrontation on BBC's Panorama programme between Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, and Mr Alan Beith, the Liberal Democrats' economic spokesman. The three main party leaders will appear separately on subsequent Panorama programmes up to the election, starting with Mr Paddy Ashdown for the Liberal Democrats, Mr Neil Kinnock for Labour and finally the prime minister. The party leaders will also be interviewed separately by Sir Robin Day on Sky News, but with Mr Kinnock, rather than Mr John Major, the last to appear. It is the first general election for Sky News, the 24-hour satellite television news service. Its output will add to what Britain's broadcasters are promising to be the most comprehensive coverage yet of a British election. BBC BBC1's flagship Nine O'Clock News has been extended by 15 minutes and will feature foreign affairs editor John Simpson assigned to cover Mr Major, foreign affairs correspondent Brian Hanrahan with Mr Kinnock and Carole Walker with Mr Ashdown. Sir Robin Day is back three mornings a week on BBC1's Breakfast News to debate the campaign issues with a panel of 'three wise men' - Lord Jenkins of Hillhead, Mr Denis Healey and Mr Norman Tebbit. At 9.05am there is a daily Election Call hosted by Jonathan Dimbleby and carried simultaneously on radio and television. The number to ring is 071-799 5000. Campaign Report will go out three times a day on Radio 4's long-wave network with the latest campaign updates at 10.30am, 3pm and 8pm. David Dimbleby will conduct 40-minute interviews with the party leaders on the three last Mondays of the campaign. On BBC1 on Sunday evenings, Olivia O'Leary will present The Vote Race, a new series designed to investigate what the party managers and manipulators are up to. A studio audience linked to vote-meters will say whether they like or believe the campaign messages. ITN The main ITN programmes will feature everything from live satellite links from the constituencies to trend polling, focus groups and special reports on 'constituency clusters' - groups of seats in certain regions with particular characteristics. There will also be family profiles of the main party leaders. The main ITN programmes are: World and Election News on Channel 4 Daily, 6.30 - 9.25am; ITN Lunchtime News on ITV, 12.30-1.10pm; ITN Early Evening News on ITV, 5.40-5.55pm; Channel 4 News 7pm, 7.50pm; News at Ten on ITV 10.00-10.30pm; Channel 4 News: Midnight Special, 12.00pm-2.00am. Midnight Special will feature a wide range of guests, not just party spokesmen. CHANNEL 4 Apart from ITN's news programmes and Midnight Special, Channel 4 will offer four critiques of the electoral process in its Dispatches documentary series. In particular, Hugo Young will look at how the politicians try to manipulate broadcasters and how, in his view, broadcasters generally let them get away with it. The network will also offer a special edition of the Channel 4 Debate on the Sunday before polling day, an extended review of how the campaign is going on Midway Sunday by the team from A Week In Politics and an election edition of Hard News on press coverage of the campaign. On every weekday evening Comment will be devoted to ordinary voters from around the country discussing the campaign. SKY NEWS Sky will cover the daily morning party press conferences live in Sky News Sunrise. Sky News Phone-In will be extended daily to question politicians on the issues dominating that day's campaigning, and throughout the day Sky news crews will shadow leading politicians. In addition, the Target discussion programme on Tuesdays and Fridays at 8.30pm will feature Norman Tebbit who is standing down as Conservative MP for Chingford, Dame Barbara Castle, the former Labour MP and Lord Rogers, one of the 'Gang of Four' who founded the Social Democratic Party.</p>

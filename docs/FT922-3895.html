			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / International Company News: Avon plans 1,000 job cuts by 1994 AVON Products, one of the world's largest manufacturers of cosmetics and toiletries, is planning to cut around 1,000 jobs by 1994 - a move which the company says will help reduce annual operating costs by around Dollars 40m, writes Nikki Tait in New York. At end-December, the New York-based company employed around 30,500 people, one-third of whom were in the US and the rest overseas. The announcement came as Avon said it was shutting down a manufacturing operation in Alcala de Henares in Spain. This will eliminate around 140 jobs. Avon, which has operated in Spain for almost three decades, will retain a local headquarters and distribution centre in Alcala de Henares, but will supply the Spanish market from manufacturing facilities in the UK, Germany and Italy.</p>

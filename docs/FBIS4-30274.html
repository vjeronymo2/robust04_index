			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Take Care of Baht Value"] </F>   [Text] As the whole world is mesmerized by the ongoing  world soccer tournament, a monetary crisis has suddenly broken  out. The world's major currency, the U.S. dollar, has plunged  in value while Japanese yen has skyrocketted. On Wednesday, one  dollar fetched only 99.85 yen, the lowest since the end of the  World War II. The people in Japan and the United States are  aghast.    This monetary incident is bad for both the United States and  Japan. The U.S. Federal Reserve had to intervene in the New  York financial market by buying more U.S. dollars to save the  exchange rate from dropping. The Bank of Japan also made  similar efforts. As for Japan, the stronger yen will obviously  precipitate the problems because Japanese goods will be more  expensive and will not be able to compete in any market.    The United Stated had to intervene in the financial market  for fear of a further aggravation of its trade balance. Stock  markets fell worldwide because it is anticipated that the United  States will increase interest rates to prevent the further  decline of the dollar and to arrest inflation. To a certain  extent Thailand is also affected by a weaker dollar. One dollar  which bought 25.16 baht is now only worth only 25.05 baht. On  Wednesday, the Bank of Thailand had to work out certain measures  to prevent the baht from appreciating.    Semifinished products and raw materials imported from Japan,  Germany, and several other countries will become more expensive  now. As a result of the new exchange rate, the price of Thai  products will rise because we have to add in the risk-cost of  the new rate. Although we use U.S. dollars as our medium of  trade, we will have some difficulties in selling our products in  foreign markets.    We appeal to the Bank of Thailand and the Thai Banking  Association to urgently work out measures to prevent the baht  from appreciating. We must not think that we can relax just  because our baht is tied to a basket of currencies. The  probability of the appreciation of the baht currency is always  there despite its link with other currencies.    Several countries have now recognized our baht currency,  while many people have called for the relaxation of restrictions  on the release of baht loans in foreign countries. We must be  extremely cautious and try to stabilize the value of our baht  currency.</p>

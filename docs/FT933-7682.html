			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / BAe deal in Taiwan less sure BRITISH Aerospace conceded yesterday that talks on finalising arrangements for a Pounds 250m joint venture with Taiwan Aerospace Corporation (TAC) were 'taking longer than we had anticipated'. BAe, which three weeks ago said it regarded the deal as a certainty, was responding to reports that Mr Yang Shih-chien, the Taiwanese vice economics minister, had said the deal could still collapse. Mr Yang has been closely involved in the establishment of the venture and blamed differences over the financing of the joint venture, called Avro. BAe said that this was the main subject of the talks still to be resolved. BAe shares fell 14p to 454p on the news because the deal is central to BAe's drive to return to profitability. It would mean manufacture of the RJ range of regional jets would be partly carried on in Taiwan, which is close to the fast-growing east Asia markets and which offers lower labour costs. The stumbling block in the talks is thought to concern collateral for loans to Avro. Several banks both own stakes in Avro and are lending it money. But Taiwan law prohibits a bank from extending unsecured financing to a venture in which it holds more than 3 per cent. Behind this obstacle lies concern among some Taiwan investors that the project might not make money. One of the reasons BAe needs a partner with strong manufacturing capability and access to markets is that its regional aircraft business has lost money for several years. TAC, 29 per cent owned by the government, and British Aerospace signed an agreement in January 1993 to form a 50-50 venture making the RJ family of regional passenger jets, which would be assembled in Taiwan and the UK. Mr Yang last month confirmed that the government would increase its direct equity holding in TAC to 39 per cent. This holding will be through two bodies: a government development fund, which will lift its stake in TAC from 24 per cent to 29 per cent, and the state-run Chiao Tung Bank, which will raise its stake from 5 to 10 per cent.</p>

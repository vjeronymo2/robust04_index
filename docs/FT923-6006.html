As a commissioner, he will share responsibility for the selection of the high-fliers who will become the next generation of Whitehall mandarins. At 49, Sorensen has spent most of his career in the civil service. He was appointed by Michael Heseltine to lead his Merseyside Task Force and later spent nearly a year at the Cabinet Office pulling together the Government's inner city programmes. He has also been deputy secretary at the Housing Corporation and director of personnel management and training at the environment department. Maintaining the civil service Oxbridge tradition is Geoffrey Maddrell, also made a commissioner yesterday. A Cambridge graduate, 56-year-old Maddrell is currently chief executive of Proshare, the organisation set up to promote share ownership. A member of the CBI Education and Training Affairs Committee, he is a non-executive director of Transport Development Group and a governor of the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology. He held senior positions with Tootal and Bowater and was a past chairman of the Manchester Training and Enterprise Council. Maddrell replaces Gerald Dennis who retires as commissioner at the end of August. Sorensen takes over the seat vacated by Julian Moore who is returns to the Office of Public Service and Science.</p>

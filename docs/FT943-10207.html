			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Sour taste of beef stew: With beef farmers and fishermen up in arms, are EU rules turning the continent animal crackers? Britain's beef farmers are in disarray. Prices for cows at livestock auctions have plummeted, producers face hefty falls in their profits, abattoirs are running out of supplies. Radical change may be the only way for the industry to survive. The cause of the upheaval is the decision by European agriculture ministers to impose new restrictions on UK exports of carcass beef - the bulk of beef exports to continental Europe - in order to crack down on 'mad cow disease'. The rules ban the export of carcasses of any animal over six months' old unless they come from herds certified free of the disease, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), for six years. Until last week, animals had come from herds that had been free of the disease for only two years. The tightening of export rules has hit most dairy farmers hard as, in effect, it halts the export of cull cows - old dairy cows that have finished their productive life and are slaughtered, mainly for processing into meat pies, sausages and ready-made meals. Last year, exports of carcasses from old dairy cows accounted for some 75,000 tonnes of Britain's 128,000 tonnes of beef exports to the European Union, with France taking about 70 per cent of the beef for deboning in its own plants. Total British beef production last year was 877,000 tonnes. The government reckons that more than half of Britain's dairy herds have been affected by BSE. As a consequence, the change in regulations has closed off export outlets and forced down prices at livestock markets by 30 per cent or more. Mr John Glanvill, a dairy farmer near Exeter, says that is equivalent to a drop in price of about Pounds 150 a cow. Mr Hugh Black, a dairy farmer near Leominster, Herefordshire, who has lost 25 cows from his herd of 140 to BSE in the past few years, believes cows he sells this year will be worth Pounds 12,000 less as a result of the price drop. 'This will come right off the bottom line,' he said. 'It could knock 20 per cent off our profits.' The financial effect across the industry is likely to be significant, but the National Farmers' Union says it is too soon to quantify. 'There is a great deal of uncertainty and concern throughout the industry and the only way to get around that is an administrative hassle,' said Sir David Naish, president of the National Farmers' Union. Sir David is referring to the problem faced by farmers if they want to provide a certificate stating their cow has not been in a herd affected by BSE over the past six years. Only with this certificate can farmers send carcasses for export. The ministry of agriculture record herds which are affected by BSE but because of data protection rules cannot release the names and addresses of farmers. That means a considerable bureaucratic effort is required to trace every home of each animal. 'It's an unbelievable administrative burden. All you have is an ear tag with the cow's number on it, but nowhere to start to find out where it's been,' said Mr Martin Burtt, a livestock farmer in North Yorkshire. Sir David will meet Mr William Waldegrave, the agriculture minister, on Monday to press him to release more information from the register of BSE herds. Mr Waldegrave has had cases of BSE on his own Somerset dairy farm and appreciates farmers' feelings. But he warns the trade is in for 'an uncomfortable transition'. That shift is likely to see British cows selling at reduced prices while the industry struggles to bring on stream capacity for deboning beef in the UK. This would enable it to redirect its marketing effort towards selling boneless beef abroad. Deboned beef has tissues such as the brain, spinal cord and spleen removed - the organs which could pose a risk, however remote, to human health, according to the agriculture ministry. Some abattoirs do not have deboning facilities and others say they have little spare capacity. But Anglo Dutch Meats at Eastbourne, one of the UK's largest beef deboning plants, believes the change to exports of deboned beef could be achieved reasonably quickly. Mr Nik Askaroff, managing director, said the company, which processes 15,000 tonnes of beef a year, has had more than 15 inquiries from continental European traders willing to buy UK carcasses and have them deboned before they leave the country. 'At the moment we run only one shift,' he said. 'We could double our capacity in a fairly short time and nearly treble it within a year.' The farmers' union wants the government to apply for EU aid for farmers to store beef carcasses over the next couple of months while UK boning capacity is increased. But the union agrees that the farmers have to launch a marketing drive to increase sales of boneless beef abroad - otherwise they risk a glut in the UK. Farmers, meanwhile, are worried that any glut of boned beef - or carcasses - will be exacerbated by the effect of the tighter export restrictions on consumer confidence in the UK, just when they believed they were winning the war of words against BSE. The incidence of BSE peaked at the start of 1993, but declined by 23 per cent in the first six months of this year. The Meat and Livestock Commission, the marketing organisation, says some reports from butchers have indicated a drop in beef purchases, but it is not yet clear if this is in response to renewed fears over BSE or the hot weather encouraging people to eat salads. Mr Ken Cork, a butcher in Fernhead, Cheshire, said: 'It's definitely affected us: we've had lots of inquiries about whether the beef is safe or not and although you try to reassure people, it's difficult to convince them 100 per cent.' So far, retail prices have been affected little by the slump in cattle prices at auction, but Mr Cork expects to pay less for his wholesale supplies next week. That might feed through into lower prices for the consumer. If the British beef industry fails to develop overseas markets for boneless beef, it could be the domestic shopper who benefits by seeing prices fall. Farmers may not like it, but carnivores will not beef.</p>

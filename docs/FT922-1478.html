			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Survey on A-Z of Computing (6): Start of a world free from paper - EDI The idea of electronic data interchange (EDI) is quite simple. It is the exchange of routine company documents such as orders and invoices in electronic form between computers run by suppliers and their customers. The implications of this are considerable. Research company Yankee Group estimates that without EDI, 70 per cent of all computer output becomes computer input: information is keyed in to one company's computer, processed and printed as an order document and posted to another company, where the information is keyed in again. The replacement of this possibly week-long process by instant electronic communication eliminates human error and drastically cuts administrative costs - but that is only the start. The potential for reductions in processing time for orders means that manufacturing companies and retail chains can cut stock-holdings and go for finely tuned just-in-time manufacturing and shelf filling. Big industrial users are making savings of several hundred thousand pounds a month. Europe's biggest EDI service supplier, International Network Services (INS), says purchasing departments using EDI find the time spent on creating and pushing through paperwork has been cut from 80 per cent of the total to 20 per cent, because they now only have to deal with exceptions. This means buyers can now spend 80 per cent of their time on the jobs they are paid to do: negotiating the best deals with suppliers. EDI can be an advantage in such negotiations: some big buyers have said they look for good deals from suppliers which are reducing their costs through the improved cash flow arising from faster payment of invoices and the benefits of EDI links to their own suppliers. EDI pioneers are now moving on still further. Andy Bytheway of the Cranfield School of Management, who is leading research on the use, costs and benefits of EDI, points to self-billing and automatic re-stocking of customers as examples of how EDI is creating new relationships between trading partners. With EDI providing close links and fast turnround of information, trusted suppliers can be authorised to deliver goods as their customers' stocks run low, without needing order messages. Meanwhile the customers can invoice themselves and arrange payment through banks, which are also starting to join in the EDI game to complete the order-invoice-payment cycle. As Sean Phelan, a senior industry analyst at Yankee Group, puts it, 'bringing in EDI isn't just like getting a fax machine. Companies are starting to see it's part of the whole idea of business re-engineering'. The benefits have brought big growth in the use of EDI. INS reports 40 per cent growth last year in message traffic to 5.5m documents a month. Its figures put the number of UK organisations using EDI at around 6,400. Even small companies are moving into EDI, sometimes after less than friendly persuasion from their big customers. There have certainly been veiled threats from some large companies that suppliers which did not go to EDI would have a black mark against their names. Dr Roger Till of BP, chairman of the EDI Association, says there is 'a different atmosphere' now and that companies seek to help and convince their traders rather than threaten them. British Coal, for example, developed a Pounds 200 software package to help get its smaller suppliers started. Joining an EDI service can look expensive, especially to a small company. INS, for example, charges a one-off registration fee of between Pounds 2,000 and around Pounds 100,000, based broadly on the size of the user's computer. There is also an annual subscription of Pounds 1,000 and a usage charge of 4-6p per 1,000 characters, depending on volume. However, Bytheway at Cranfield says, 'When you consider the amount of trade between EDI partners and the reduction in paper handling, the costs are peanuts, even to smaller companies.' INS is one of several service suppliers in the UK. Others include British Telecom, IBM, AT&amp;T Istel and SD-Scicon. Companies tend to use such services because they can have a single telecommunications link to the service supplier, which directs the message traffic to the requested recipient. The alternative is to have individual links to every business contact. EDI users and service suppliers say the use of different message format standards by different industries is no longer a problem, largely because of the emergence of software packages which translate data from users' application systems into the required formats and make the links to the requested network services. Prices start at around Pounds 2,500. Ultimately, services will move towards the emerging Edifact group of international standards but total use is many years away - the car manufacturers' EDI group, Odette, for example, will not start pushing its members towards Edifact until 1994, and INS, which has supported Edifact alongside the retail industry's Tradacoms formats since 1987, says only 10 per cent of its customers use it. With such issues largely sorted out and EDI use growing rapidly, research firm Input goes as far as to conclude that 'companies which ignore or reject EDI could well be disabled from continuing their activities'.</p>

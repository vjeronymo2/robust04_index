			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on reporter's commentary entitled "Commodity Prices </F> Also Need Comprehensive Management"]    [Text] In the first quarter of this year, the increased  scale of retail prices has reached more than 18 percent. The  higher prices of retail commodities, which have prevailed since  the beginning of this year, is unprecedented for many year. If  we fail to adopt strong and effective measures to readjust or  control them, the continuously excessive price hikes in markets  certainly will affect the economic construction and the people's  normal lives. It should be said that governments at all levels  throughout the province have attached great importance on the  work of commodity prices. They have issued many legal documents  to prevent from rising prices and collecting fees arbitrarily  each year and spent more than 20 million of financial revenues  on curbing the price hikes. Over the past three months, the  provincial people's government has organized two mass  inspections over commodity prices throughout the province, in  which it discovered more than 500 price violation cases as well  as confiscated the illegal profits and imposed on fines that  total 1.57 million yuan. Although the results scored in the  inspections conducted with all methods, including economic,  legal, and administrative ones, are obvious; the evil trend of  rising commodity prices and collecting fees arbitrarily has not  been totally rooted out. As soon as the mass inspection has  been over, the prices of the necessities of the people's lives,  such as rice and cooking oil, are still being risen again and  again. The price tags issued in a unified way for many  commodities have been replaced with the self-made ones with  exorbitant prices. Nobody cares the price maximum and relevant  price regulations issued by the governments at all levels.    Since the enforcement of reform and opening up over the past  more than 10 years, the economic construction has gone ahead by  leaps and bounds and the demands of the people's lives have  increased day by day. Adequate price hikes under such a  situation may stimulate the commodity production and are  favorable for the country's construction and the people's lives.  However, excessive price hikes will surpass the masses'  bearing; curtail the consumption, and lead to the withering of  commodity production. They will not only affect the livelihood  of consumers but also directly affect the producer and dealers  of commodities, as well as will damage the social stability. As  for excessive price hikes, not only China but also developed  capitalist countries will not sit by idly and remain indifferent  and they will be able to adopt economic, legal, and  administrative means to meddle them. Many commodity dealers  have contended that relaxing the restrictions on commodity  prices means to ask prices at will. Thus, they have become  price violators again and again. Therefore, abiding by the  price regulations set by the government, running business  legally, and consciously safeguarding the price order represent  the duty exercised by every dealer. The price departments  should strictly investigate and handle the price violations.  It is unfortunate that there are only more than 10,000 work  personnel in the price departments throughout the province.  Successfully managing the market prices requires the joint  efforts made the relevant departments and the masses. They  should jointly conduct comprehensive management of commodity  prices as they did for public security. For example, the  departments of industry and commerce, tax affairs, and quality  inspection at all levels, should concurrently take up the work  of price management. The mass organizations and communities,  such as women's federations and trade unions, should enliven  their contingents of staff members and workers to conduct price  supervision. Consumers should actively supervise the market  prices. Only by so doing are the price violation dealers unable  to avail themselves of loopholes and can we fundamentally deal  with the problems of rising prices and collecting fees  arbitrarily and truly and successfully manage the market prices.</p>

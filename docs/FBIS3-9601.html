He added  that, as a city, Serb Sarajevo was built on Serb areas and that  Serbs have a right to it.    Thanking everyone who helped Serb Sarajevo preserve freedom  and remain Serb, Krajisnik stressed that the struggle is not  over yet, and that Serb enemies are still claiming the right to  that part of the Serb ethnic territory. Krajisnik repeated that  Serbs will not enter any kind of federation with Croats and  Muslims, and that they will decide where and with whom to live  on the basis of their right to self-determination. "We allow  others to do everything we want to do, and if we are to be  blamed for that, then we are guilty," Krajisnik said.    "Great pressure will be exerted on us to make further  concessions. We can negotiate and find a compromise solution,  but only so far as this will not threaten the minimum of our  national interests. We cannot go below that, and we do not have  the right to do that," Krajisnik said.    The deputies in the Srpska assembly of the Novo Sarajevo  municipality and guests at today's formal session paid tribute  to more than 1,200 victims -- half of whom were civilians -- who  have fallen in defense of that part of Serb Sarajevo.</p>

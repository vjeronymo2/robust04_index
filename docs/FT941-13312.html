			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Spanish banks jib at Banesto rescue Opposition is growing among Spain's private banks to making a large contribution to the rescue of Banco Espanol de Credito, despite efforts by Mr Luis Angel Rojo, the Bank of Spain's governor, to gain their support. Mr Rojo yesterday met the chairmen of the top five private banks to present them with proposals drawn up by Banesto's management to restructure its capital and relaunch the bank following intervention by the central bank a month ago. The private banks believe they are being asked to carry an excessive burden to refloat Banesto. While they are prepared to help with Banesto's restructuring, they are unwilling to participate in a venture that could turn Banesto into a powerful rival. 'We thought we were going to be asked to refloat a cruiser but it turns out we will be asked to build an aircraft carrier,' said one senior bank executive. The Spanish Banking Association said yesterday that the over-valuation of Banesto's assets according to the latest estimate was Pta605bn (Pounds 2.8bn). This compares with an estimate of Pta 675bn disclosed by a Banesto spokesman last week. Private banks could be asked to give up to Pta200bn to Spain's Deposit Guarantee Fund. This would underwrite a capital increase, although the equity might eventually be floated. The troubled bank, according to bankers in Madrid, will contribute to its own rescue by allocating all its Pta245bn reserves into provisions and reducing the nominal value of its shares from Pta700 to Pta500. Under the draft plan Banesto's capital increase would have been Pta120-Pta150bn and the acquisition of bad debts, to be shared with the Bank of Spain, would have represented at most Pta200bn. The Bank of Spain report triggering its intervention put Banesto's gross financing needs at Pta503bn. The latest Pta605bn estimate could climb further. US regulators are to investigate the investment rules guiding credit unions after US Central Credit Union, a Kansas-based institution that acts as a central bank to other credit unions, placed Dollars 255m in an uninsured Banesto certificate of deposit, writes George Graham in Washington.</p>

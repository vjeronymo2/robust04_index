			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Peas fail industry's 'tenderometers' Far fewer peas than usual have passed the 'tenderometer' test for freezing this year because of the hot dry summer, causing a serious shortage of frozen vegetables which will push up prices, processors warn. The pea crop is down by 10 per cent, while broad-bean production has been halved. Shortages have been worsened by the fact that the unusually hot weather spread from as far south as Spain up to Scandinavia so that buyers are fighting for supplies. The problem began with the cold, wet winter and wet spring, which meant crops were sown late and failed to develop strong roots, said Mr Arthur Whitlock of the Frozen Vegetables Association, which represents the UK's main processors. The weak plants then suffered stress from the drought, which also forced them to mature too quickly. For peas, which are measured with a 'tenderometer' for freezing, the normal time limit for harvesting was cut from four or five hours to as little as two. 'A lot of the crops had to be left because they got too tough,' said Mr Whitlock. The problem is also affecting later crops such as broccoli and cauliflower. The young plants struggled to establish themselves in the dry weather and now risk being damaged by the first frosts before they are ready for harvesting. 'All the growers with whom the processors are contracted are unlikely to meet their targeted tonnages,' said Mr Whitlock. 'I can't recall another occasion in the last five years when the UK and west Europe have both been down the pan together.'</p>

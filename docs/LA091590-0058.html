			<p><P> September 15, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS ATTORNEY GENERAL;  </P> <P> LUNGREN, SMITH CLASH OVER REPRESENTING STATE ON 2 ABORTION ISSUES  </P> <P> In a rare joint appearance Friday, state attorney general candidates Dan  Lungren and Arlo Smith clashed over whether, if elected, they would have the  duty to represent the state in court on two controversial abortion law issues.  </P> <P> Democrat Smith, a staunch abortion rights activist, said he would refuse to  represent the state if the Legislature approved a new law restricting public  funding of abortions for the poor. The 11-year San Francisco district attorney  also said he would probably not defend a 1987 state law facing court review  that would require pregnant minors to obtain parental consent before having  abortions.  </P> <P> "Laws that would deprive the woman of the right to choose clearly violate . . .  the California Constitution," said Smith, referring to the right to privacy  provision. "The attorney general's obligation is to protect the Constitution  and to protect the public's rights under that Constitution."  </P> <P> Republican Lungren, a longtime abortion foe, agreed that both the state  Constitution and case law clearly provide the right to abortions. But he added  that neither rule out restrictions on teen access or Medi-Cal funding.  </P> <P> "Arlo and I have a big difference here," said the former five-term congressman.  "I mean, I am not a liberal Democrat. I don't believe because there's a right  declared, that means that the state has an obligation to pay for it."  </P> <P> The Medi-Cal funding issue has come up frequently during the last decade, with  the state Legislature repeatedly banning public funding, Atty. Gen. John K. Van  de Kamp defending the laws and the state Supreme Court concluding that they  were unconstitutional. Two years ago, Van de Kamp refused to represent the  state any longer. No funding restriction law is pending.  </P> <P> As for teen access, Lungren called it constitutionally "defensible," but Smith  said, "I would want to look at all the case law, (but) it probably is  unconstitutional."  </P> <P> The pair proceeded to debate how many public debates they should have at a  breakfast session of the Friday Group, an organization of political  journalists.  </P> <P> Under the group's ground rules, TV cameras were excluded from the forum -- only  the second joint appearance of the two candidates since Smith upset Los Angeles  County Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner in the June Democratic primary.  </P> <P> Before the primary, in which Lungren ran unopposed, the pair debated four  times, in moderator-free, Lincoln-Douglas-style sessions. Days after, Lungren  extended an invitation for a similar series of pre-election debates. Smith  declined and said Friday his schedule provided limited time to meet Lungren in  any type of forum.  </P> <P> Hours later, Smith's campaign manager, Marc Dann, announced that Smith had  reached an agreement to appear with Lungren on two 30-minute  question-and-answer news conference programs -- on KCBS-TV and on KNBC-TV --  that would air Oct. 7, the same day as the first gubernatorial debate.  </P> <P> A Lungren aide expressed displeasure with the format. Dann was pleased. "It's  highly unusual," he said. "It's a debate-athon."  </P></p>

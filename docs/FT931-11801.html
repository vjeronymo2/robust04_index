			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / International Company News: Torras appeals against court ruling LAWYERS acting for Grupo Torras, the Kuwait Investment Office's troubled Spanish holding arm, have filed an appeal against a ruling by Madrid's senior monetary court that had rejected allegations of serious fraud brought by Torras against seven of its former senior executives. The move, filed minutes before midnight on Friday, when the deadline for an appeal expired, sets the scene for continued litigation that threatens the KIO's orderly withdrawal from its once pace-setting Spanish investments. The legal battle centres on an attempt by Mr Ali-Rashid al-Bader, chairman of the KIO since February last year, and by his close friend Mr Mahmoud al-Nouri, whom he appointed to run Torras three months later, to blame former KIO and Torras executives for multi-million dollar losses incurred by the KIO in Spain. Last week the Madrid court rejected a criminal lawsuit brought by Torras against Sheikh Fahad al-Sabah, the KIO's former chairman and a cousin of the Emir of Kuwait, Mr Fouad Jaffar, the KIO's former general manager, Mr Javier de la Rosa, Torras' former deputy chairman, and four other former senior Torras managers. The seven were accused of causing 'fraudulent losses for the company well in excess of Pta100bn (Dollars 89m)'. Rejecting the suit, the judge ruled that it did not contain 'a single indication' that fiscal crimes had been committed by those it accused. The lawsuit had alleged irregularities including fraud, tax evasion, falsifying public deeds and price manipulation. The appeal is likely to be argued through the judicial hierarchy in Spain and could be pursued, if necessary, in London, the KIO's headquarters. 'The plaintiffs are very serious about this and they won't give up,' said a Madrid lawyer close to the KIO. The renewed litigation could, however, affect developments aimed at loosening the links that bind Torras, which was put into receivership by its new management in December, with top Spanish companies. Torras' new management has said it intended to extricate itself from corporate responsibilities in Spain. Torras is negotiating the restoration of discount lines that would assure its wholly-owned subsidiary Torraspapel, Spain's largest paper producer, of short-term funding. It is also seeking boardroom approval for the sale of its 38 per cent stake in Ebro, Spain's leading food company, and is attempting to write off its considerable investment in Ercros, the leading domestic chemical conglomerate which is 36 per cent Torras owned and was put into receivership last July.</p>

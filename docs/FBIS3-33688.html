			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] We have received confirmed news from Baghdad saying  that on the evening of Wednesday, 26 January 1994, a number of  jumbo [preceding word in English] cars, affiliated with the  Iraqi regime's intelligence service, were driven at high speed  into a square near the Baghdad International Fair, which has  become a market for dollar dealers. The Iraqi regime's  intelligence forces asked the dealers to be quiet and to remain  in their places. However, the dealers, who were aware of the  intentions of the intelligence men, tried to escape. The  regime's men fired at those who tried to escape, killing and  wounding many innocent people. After gaining control over the  area, the regime men arrested many people and left the bodies of  the slain in the streets. Such criminal acts have exacerbated  the miserable situation in Baghdad and increased the citizens'  worries.</p>

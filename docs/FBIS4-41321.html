			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Yevgeniy Albats: "Back in 1990 the USSR KGB </F> Reported That the DPRK Had Completed the Development of a  Nuclear Device"]    [Text] The polemics over the DPRK and its nuclear weapons  are becoming increasingly fascinating. Particularly when they  come from people who are presumably competent in these matters.    As has been reported, spokesmen for our Atomic Energy  Ministry assured the press that the DPRK does not posesses the  requisite quantity of plutonium to develop a nuclear bomb. But  the reactor in Yongbyon, in the development of which specialists  from the aforementioned ministry were most actively involved, is  apparently intended to serve national economic and scientific  needs. One deduces from this that neither we nor any other  countries have any need to fear that North Korean nuclear bombs  will be dropping on our heads.    The Atomic Energy Ministry's view was fully confirmed by  DPRK  ambassador in Moscow Mr. Son Song-pil, who honored the State  Duma International Affairs Committee with his presence: "We do  not have the technical potential to produce nuclear weapons," he  said.    Finally, Russian intelligence, as IZVESTIYA wrote recently,  also denies that Pyongyang has the technology and capacity to  produce nuclear weapons. This is amusing. Amusing because four  years ago it said precisely the opposite, the words coming from  Vladimir Kryuchkov, USSR KGB chairman at the time.    The document that is cited below is a memorandum from  Kryuchkov (No. 363-K) to the USSR leadership, dated 22 February  1990 and headed "On the question of the development of nuclear  weapons in the DPRK." Here is the full text:    "The KGB has been informed by a reliable source that  research  and development work is actively continuing in the DPRK on  nuclear weapons. The North Korean leaders, in particular, Kim  Chong-il, who is personally supervising the aforementioned  research, are seeking military superiority over South Korea and  are also pursuing the goal of joining the states that possess  these weapons.    "According to available data, the development of the first  nuclear device has been completed at the DPRK nuclear research  center in Yongbyon, in Pyongan-pukto Province. There are no  plans for testing it at the moment in order to conceal from the  world public and international monitoring organizations the fact  that nuclear weapons are being produced in the DPRK.    "The KGB is taking extra steps to check the data.    "This is for your information.    "KGB Chairman V. Kryuchkov."    A brief explanation is required. According to specialists,  the device mentioned in Kryuchkov's memorandum is different from  an actual nuclear bomb, in the same way, well, as... a woman  who has only just woken up differs from one who is about to go  out. That is, from the physics viewpoint, the nuclear bomb  already exists, but further engineering and design efforts are  needed before it takes shape and can be loaded in an aircraft or  on a missile; it will have to be dressed in the proper uniform.  As world experience has shown, these efforts will take  two-three years.    But the important thing is that the device requires  basically  the same amount of plutonium as an operational -- albeit not  large -- nuclear bomb. Given that, given the fact that the DPRK  already had a device ready in 1990, and testing was only being  prevented by certain external reasons, it means that the DPRK  had, indeed has the requisite quantity of plutonium.  Consequently, both our competent experts and the ambassador are  lying. If, of course, you believe Kryuchkov's memorandum.    And I think it should be believed. Because despite the  fact that relations between the USSR and the DPRK had been  strained in recent years and North Korean special services were  somewhat suspicious of their colleagues in the socialist camp,  organized information channels were functioning. In the first  place, because North Korean nuclear scientists would scarcely  have managed without the assistance of Soviet nuclear experts  and, second, because the DPRK was in the sphere of interests of  a whole clutch of KGB departments. The "country of Chuche" was  attracting the attention of both the intelligence service -- the  DPRK was covered by its 6th department -- and the  counterintelligence service -- the document cited above was not  prepared by Kryuchkov himself, of course, but by Colonel V.L.  Smolnov, who worked in the 16th department of the Second Main  Directorate (KGB counterintelligence). Finally, the former KGB  also had an Eleventh Department -- the department coordinating  the activities of socialist countries' security services. It is  now called the international relations service and is part of  the Federal Counterintelligence Service Treaty and Law  Administration. So despite all the strains in relations with  the DPRK, our KGB knew how to arrange things with theirs: We  even allowed North Korean special services to work on our  territory -- in labor settlements where there were North Korean  workers.    The point of all this is to show that as well as the  aforesaid document there must be other, later intelligence  reports in KGB archives on DPRK successes in developing nuclear  weapons.    At a State Duma sitting Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said  that he had all the necessary information on the subject. At a  meeting at ITAR-TASS Kozyrev expressed fears that North Korea  might develop a nuclear bomb in the very near future. Although,  according to other sources, what Kozyrev means by "in the very  near future" is in five-seven years' time. But one would hope  that the minister really does have all the requisite  information, including the document I cited. If not (and in our  country, given the shambles our archives are in, anything can  happen), then I must hasten to report to the minister that in  fall 1991 this memorandum by Kryuchkov was stored in the  archives of the USSR KGB secretariat, file No. 132, volume four,  page 143, marked "Top Secret" 07-07.    Finally, the games our competent experts are playing are  fascinating in their way, of course. Unless, of course, you  consider the possibility that a mad dictator might order North  Korean nuclear bombs to start falling on our heads and if you  forget that we are dealing with one of the most terrifying  totalitarian regimes, which is desperately trying to survive,  almost on its own, and is prepared -- as our own history teaches  us -- to go to any lengths, even nuclear blackmail, to achieve  that.    Do we not fear for our children?</p>

			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / 'We were kept in a brick stove' TEARS welled up in the eyes of Hasan, a retired Moslem villager, as a fellow refugee told him yesterday how his younger brothers were beaten at a detention camp, disappeared, and probably were dead, AP reports from Zagreb, the capital of Croatia. Otherwise, there was none of the emotion of a meeting of two rural men from the same area who chanced upon each other in flight from war. A quick exchange of names and professions by Hasan, a 67-year-old former building engineer, and Adem, a 56-year-old forest worker, provided what likely will have to stand as confirmation of two more deaths in Bosnia-Hercegovina. Serb officials in Bosnia deny they are holding civilians in inhumane conditions. Yesterday the information minister of their self-proclaimed government told journalists in northern Bosnia that Serbs also had been kept in a camp, and charged that many of the women had been raped. He said the Serbs had been kept by Croats and Moslems in a camp in the northeast Bosnian town of Odzak until it was captured last month. The women who had been raped had been sent to the Serbian province of Vojvodina to recover. The three men, Hasan, Adem, and a third man, 70-year-old Mehmed, all say they survived Serb camps before being allowed to flee to Croatia. All three said they were from villages in the vicinity of Kozarac, a town in northwest Bosnia-Hercegovina about 120 km southeast of Zagreb. Such stories usually are impossible to verify, reporters rarely are able to visit such places. But the three men provided detail of their captivity and personal data that appeared to corroborate their reports. They provided their family names but asked that they not be published to protect relatives who still could be held. Hasan said he spent 50 days in three camps ' Omarska, Trnopolje and a brick-factory near Prijedor. Aid workers convinced him and other villagers when Serb forces arrived in Kozarac that they would be treated like refugees, he said. But as soon as people gathered, soldiers separated men from women and children and took the men to the brick factory. 'We were kept in a brick stove, only three by six meters (yards) big, with one door, no food or drink,' he said. In three days, he said, he was taken to a camp near Omarska, about 25 kilometers (15 miles) from Prijedor. Interrogators accused him of lying about his family, he recalled. 'Two or three men there beat me with sticks, gun butts, hands and feet for about one hour, asking and beating, then asking again.' He lost seven teeth when he got hit with the butt of a gun in the mouth, and broke his collar bone, he said. Hasan is the oldest of nine sons, and in Omarska, he found two of his younger brothers, he said. They also were beaten. But after three days, Hasan was moved again, to nearby Trnopolje. He did not see his brothers again.</p>

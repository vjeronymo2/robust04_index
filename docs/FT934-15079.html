			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei falls 1.2% in an otherwise strong region SHARE prices tumbled in post holiday trading as selling hit component stocks of the Nikkei 225 which had failed to be included into the new Nikkei 300 index, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 fell 241.33, or 1.2 per cent, to 20,137.31, having opened at the day's high of 20,376.34 before tumbling to the day's low of 20,116.71. Details of the new index were announced last Friday, but investors had been unable to adjust positions on Monday because of a national holiday. Volume was 226m shares against 318m. Traders said that the gap between the Nikkei and Topix index was widening as investors tried to shift from positions based on the Nikkei 225 to the Nikkei 300. In contrast to the drop in the Nikkei, the Topix index, which is a capitalisation weighted index of 1,233 stocks, only lost 4.14 to 1,652.26. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 1.24 to 1,283.66. Declines led advances by 643 to 347, with 171 issues remaining unchanged. The Osaka securities exchange is expected to list a new futures contract based on the Nikkei 300 in January and traders said that index-related selling was likely to continue for the rest of the week. However, traders said that it was too early to forecast if the Nikkei 300 would become a new benchmark for the market, replacing the Nikkei 225. Mr Chris Newton at James Capel said that the Topix index was becoming the widely accepted index among many market participants. Of the components of the Nikkei 225, 70 issues were not adopted for the new capitalisation weighted index. Keisei Electric Railway fell Y50 to Y1,150, Takara Shuzo lost Y30 to Y730, Hitachi Zosen fell Y18 to Y571, Japan Airlines declined Y21 to Y723, and KDD retreated Y200 to Y12,400. On the other hand, stocks included in the Nikkei 300 gained ground, with Chudenko rising Y80 to Y4,150 and Takashimaya advancing Y10 to Y1,260. Bando Chemical rose Y6 to Y688 on its development of a special chemical used in copying machines which removes toner from paper. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 29.51 to 22,344.55 in volume of 11.9m shares. Roundup MANY Pacific Rim markets continued on their record setting ways. SINGAPORE saw demand blue chips push equities to a record closing high in choppy trading. The Straits Times Industrial index added 4.90 to 2,051.47 after an intraday peak of 2,062.33. Analysts noted that foreign institutions are currently increasing their weightings in a market whose capitalisation will be increased by at least 25 per cent, from the current SDollars 140bn, by the listing of Singapore Telecom on November 1. KUALA LUMPUR saw a surge in the shares of Telekom Malaysia and Tenaga Nasional which drove the composite index through the 900 mark. The index closed up 10.56 at a record 905.71, after an intraday peak of 912.74. Telekom and Tenaga Nasional firmed MDollars 1.10 and 30 cents respectively to MDollars 18.60 and MDollars 12.10. MANILA was propelled to another record close by the strong showing of PDLT, again building on its Wall Street performance. The composite index rose 67.30 to 2,093.83. Strong foreign demand took PLDT 145 pesos higher to 1,665 pesos. NEW ZEALAND built on a strong overnight performance by Telecom in New York and the NZSE-40 capital share index closed 29.7, or 1.48 per cent higher at 2,039.78, its highest close since December of 1989. Telecom added 17 cents to a record close of NZDollars 4.40. TAIWAN closed higher in active trade after Monday's holiday.

Brokers said that the market remained unaffected by the day's deadline for identifying false-name financial accounts. AUSTRALIA ended its nine-day rally as profit-taking left the All Ordinaries index 11.8 lower at 2,028.0 BANGKOK succumbed to profit-taking triggered by heavy sales of Bangkok Bank and some other large capitalisation issues, reversing an eight day bull run which saw the market rise 16.3 per cent. The SET index fell 21.78 or 1.9 per cent to 1,101.96 in turnover of Bt16.12bn. Bangkok Bank shed Bt5 to Bt148.</p>

			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity recovery changes into reverse AN ATTEMPT to extend the recovery in UK equities ran abruptly into reverse yesterday, and by the close of trading London was joining in the general reaction on European bourses to negative comments on German interest rate prospects from the president of the Bundesbank. Not even a 6.6 per cent jump in ICI shares on the disclosure that the chemical group is considering splitting itself into two public companies could save the FT-SE Index from a 28-point about-turn which left it 11.6 down on the day at 2,411.6. Equities opened strongly, spurred on by the 45-point gain in Wall Street's Dow Average overnight and a 459-point advance in the Nikkei Average. The Footsie, benefiting from the steep rise in ICI, equivalent to 4.7 points on the index at one stage, extended its initial advance to 16.5. The stock market at first chose to brush off the rejection by Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, of the prospect for cuts in German interest rates before the end of the year, although his comments had been reported in the UK morning press. London's optimism, however, was reined in when the other European bourses began to turn easier. Hints that Wall Street might not be able to extend its gains into a third trading session also unsettled London although, in the event, US equities opened steadily, with the Dow Average hardly changed when the UK market closed for the day. It was soon clear that the institutions were less willing to chase share prices after the substantial recovery in the UK stock market over the two previous trading sessions. The stock index futures sector turned somewhat erratic as the UK investment bank which had been active in the September Footsie this week backed away. While the Bundesbank president's views on interest rates were not unexpected, pessimism on interest rates was underlined by falls in UK government bonds. When the initial excitement over ICI's plans had died down a little, traders accepted that the interim trading statement from the blue chip chemical group had done little to lift the gloom still hanging over the British corporate scene. The strategy team at Credit Lyonnais Laing has examined the market leaders in terms of funds flow and debt risk, and comments that the renewed flow of brokerage profit downgrades has increased pressure on weak balance sheets. Credit Lyonnais now has top-down estimates of earnings growth of 10 per cent for both this year and next, somewhat below the aggregate view of City analysts, which it considers to be too optimistic. However, there seemed to be no great change in market sentiment yesterday. Stock Exchange statistics disclosed that retail, or customer, business in equities jumped to Pounds 1.3bn on Wednesday, confirming that the market recovery has been led by genuine investment interest. A pause for breath was not unexpected and seemed implied by the dip in Seaq trading volume, which incorporates both retail and intra-market business, to 431.1m shares yesterday from Wednesday's 566.1m.</p>

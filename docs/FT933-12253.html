			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Arts: Tell-tale Tony - Radio THE LIVES of eminent politicians are usually serialised somewhere, but Tony Benn MP has set a new standard by offering the exclusive rights of his diaries to Radio 4. As is well known, every night before he goes to bed he tapes his day's recollections. We heard the first tape of this lot on Wednesday, at 9.45am - a notable day, marking the resignation of Harold Wilson on March 17 1976, but actually rather dull. At the farewell dinner, the recorder lay on the table, but only one phrase was worth it - 'I've never been a back-bencher,' Wilson said, 'now we can put that right.' The resignation, kept secret even from colleagues, was foreseen by the government car service personnel. They have to find a car for every former prime minister, so Wilson had already been allotted one. With Plutarch at one elbow and Robin Lane Fox at the other, I hear Radio 4's new Classic Serial, Alexander, not to learn anything fresh about that great hero, but to find how writer David Wade has managed to make the exciting story as exciting as it must be. This week's instalment (of six) began at Pella, Macedonia, in 356 BC, where Olympias had King Philip's son; and ended with Alexander about 10 years old - 'a squalid boy', Demosthenes reckoned him (nor did he change his mind later). Those 10 years were full of good detail, from the very birth on. Olympias's parturition was packed with legend - the lion, the snake, the oracle at Dodona, the boy's dedication to Zeus Ammon. There was a visit to the Dionysian festivities. We meet Barsine, who became Alexander's Persian mistress, and Hephaestion, who became his boy-friend. The luxury of Olympias's care ended when Philip appointed the Spartan Leonidas as tutor, a believer in cold baths at daybreak. Pausanias lurks with fatal steel. We shall meet all these people over the weeks, and David Wade has kept the story vivid by telling it through the memories of Achilles and Patroclus - not the heroes from the Iliad, I suspect, but Alexander's companions. The boy Alexander was remarkably well played by Sam Crane. Greek drama on Sunday on Radio 3 too, another bit of The Golden Ass; but Radio 3 has also revived its other drama slot, Studio 3, for experimental writing, on Saturdays. This week it gave us Gie Lienen's Tales from the Hatbox, translated from the Flemish by Gilberte Lenaerte. The hatbox contains photos of the Warsaw ghetto in 1941, taken by a Wehrmacht NCO, and toys kept in memory of young friends. It belonged to the NCO's son by a Jewish woman, brought up by a ghetto survivor. The tales tell of the people in the photos, sad tales of an all-too-familiar kind, illustrated with sounds from the toys. I found it slow and sentimental, with too much detail. Nothing experimental here. Tonight Studio 3 offers a very different piece, Headcrash, by Michael Wall. It supposes a new universe based on motorways. Boy, the hero (Jeremy Flynn), drives along a fantastic road, happily hitting anyone in his way. His girl-friend Yoka (Toyah Wilcox), swathed in bandages from some recent disaster, and scared only of the rats swarming in the tunnels, shoots drivers of competing cars. Besides the roads, there are 'lost cities', where only 'creeps' - if anyone - live. At a road-block, a female Field Controller ruthlessly orders Yoka into reserve and Boy to a new level. His Mother (Mary Wimbush) appears, goes through the motions of ordinary mothers, then orders him to be mean, to hate, before disappearing in devilish fire. So Boy drives on, boosted by a voice that cries 'Good hitting]' It sounds dotty, but such a world may be imagined by someone maddened by exposure to the M25, and Jeremy Mortimer's production, with its ghastly sounds, is as expert as the writing.</p>

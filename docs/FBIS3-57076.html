Yesterday morning at  the request of Deputy Marychev (from the Liberal Democratic  Party of Russia), the question of resuming the ill-fated  "Parliamentary Hour" was included on the agenda. Apart from  this, the faction comprising the Communists, Agrarians,  Zhirinovskiy-ites, and "Russian Way" deputies' group and the  "Women of Russia" affiliated to it issued a statement which  says: "ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA and YURIDICHESKAYA GAZETA ROSSII  should once again become parliamentary publications of the State  Duma."    "Trying to revive such a program is not the way to go. It  was devised in order to wage the war between the two branches of  power more successfully," Mikhail Poltoranin, chairman of the  mass media committee, told your KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA  correspondent.    [Stremidlovskiy] "Mikhail Nikiforovich, if the State Duma  does nevertheless adopt a resolution to revive `Parliamentary  Hour,' how will you implement it?"    [Poltoranin] "But it is impossible to implement.  `Parliamentary Hour' cannot return in its previous form."    Mikhail Poltoranin said that his committee was elaborating a  draft law on the provision of information on state organs. The  basic thesis is that the state organs should collaborate with  the mass media on a voluntary basis. It is easier with state  television: It will be instructed to allocate some airtime for  relaying parliamentary, government, or presidential news.</p>

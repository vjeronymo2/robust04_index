			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> [19] ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 28 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) [``NASDAQ System'' means the electronic inter-dealer quotation system]  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ``The Nasdaq Stock Market'' or ``Nasdaq'' is an electronic securities market comprised of competing market makers whose trading is supported by a communications network linking them to quotation dissemination, trade reporting, and order execution systems. This market also provides specialized automation services for screen-based negotiations of transactions, on-line comparison of transactions, and a range of informational services tailored to the needs of the securities industry, investors and issuers. The Nasdaq Stock Market consists of two distinct market tiers: the ``Nasdaq National Market'' and ``The Nasdaq SmallCap Market''. The Nasdaq Stock Market is <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  operated by [NASDAQ, Inc.]  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> wholly-owned <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  subsidiary of the Association. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the changes listed above, the proposed rule change would insert the proposed new terms, where applicable, throughout the NASD Manual. The proposed rule change also would apply to all rule filings that are approved or pending prior to the Commission's approval of the proposed rule change. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its filing with the Commission, the NASD included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the place specified in Item IV below. The NASD has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NASD is proposing to amend certain current terms and adopt new terms related to the NASDAQ System that more appropriately describe the current technological facilities and services provided by this national securities market throughout Schedule D to the NASD By-Laws)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (``Schedule D'') and other parts of the NASD's rules and regulations in the NASD Manual. The NASD believes that the proposed new terms will indicate more clearly the current functionality of the NASDAQ System as a market for securities with quotation dissemination, trade reporting, and other execution capability, as well as other specialized automation services for screen-based negotiations of transactions, on-line comparison of transactions, and a range of informational services tailored to the needs of the securities industry, investors and issues. The proposed new terms would also clarify that the NASDAQ System is composed of two distinct market tiers, each with different inclusion criteria that are set forth in different parts of Schedule D. Finally, the proposed rule change would make clear that The Nasdaq Stock Market is operated by The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Association. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 17 to Part I of Schedule D would be amended to replace the term ``NASDAQ'' with the term ``Nasdaq'' and to replace the phrase ``the NASDAQ System'' with the term ``The Nasdaq Stock Market''. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule change would add a new Section 18 to Part I of Schedule D to define the ``Nasdaq National Market'' or ``NNM'' to mean a distinct tier of The Nasdaq Stock Market comprised of securities that meet the requirements of and are authorized as a Nasdaq National Market security <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Part I, Section 18 of Schedule D would be renumbered as Section 19 and amended to replace the terms ``NASDAQ National Market System security'' and ``NASDAQ NMS security'' with the terms ``Nasdaq National Market security'' and ``NNM security'', and to clarify a current NASD requirement that such securities must satisfy ``all applicable requirements of Part II'' of Schedule D as well as substantially meet the criteria set forth Part III of Schedule D. The text of the proposed rule language to new Section 19 is based on that in Section 1 of Part II and Section 2 of Part III to Schedule D which set forth the qualification requirements and designation criteria applicable to Nasdaq SmallCap Market and Nasdaq National Market securities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

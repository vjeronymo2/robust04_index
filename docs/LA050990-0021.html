			<p><P> May 9, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RELEASE OF 2 AMERICAN HOSTAGES BY LEBANESE SHIITE KIDNAPERS  </P> <P> U.S. hostage Frank Reed has been released by his Shiite Muslim kidnapers. He  was held for approximately 3 1/2 years.  </P> <P> Although happy that he has been released and is back with his family, Reed is  reported to be angry at everybody for the length of time he and others were  kept, and that others are still there, too (Part A, May 3).  </P> <P> I wonder how he thinks the rest of us feel? He was not in Lebanon on behalf of  the United States government. For whatever reason, and it may have been a very  noble reason, he chose to stay in Lebanon even when it was very clear that any  American in Lebanon ran a very high risk of being kidnaped. Finally, he was  kidnaped. What followed cost this country, both in terms of money and in terms  of prestige.  </P> <P> Now, he is angry at everybody that he was held so long. The person he needs to  be angry at is himself for exposing himself to that danger as he did.  </P> <P> Actually, I am a little angry at him for putting us all through this affair  when it could so easily have been avoided, and for acting as if this hostage  matter is capable of resolution by the United States government.  </P> <P> He needs to grow up. This is a dangerous world. If you take a risk, then be  prepared to take the consequences.  </P> <P> PAUL D. FILLMAN  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

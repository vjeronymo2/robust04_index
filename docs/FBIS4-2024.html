			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 23 Mar (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- Since the  beginning of this year, people have been reporting problems of  exaggerating industrial output value which have emerged in some  localities. Consequently, the State Statistical Bureau and the  Ministry of Supervision dispatched investigative teams to  various localities to investigate. The findings show that such  situations indeed exist and are even quite widespread. In some  localities, the problem is quite serious. As a result, the  State Statistical Bureau and the Ministry of Supervision have  issued a circular on the problem of exaggerating industrial  output value in some localities.    Party and government leaders in some localities have  exaggerated their achievements by falsely reporting their output  value, but under pressure from the leadership, the local  statistical departments, instead of upholding principle, have  resorted to deception in violating the provisions of the  "Statistical Law." The idea of blindly competing for growth  rate among party and government leaders in some localities also  has resulted in some towns, townships, and enterprises  exaggerating their industrial output value. For example, the  Taicang City petrochemical plant consistently exaggerated its  output value between June 1992 and March this year, and it was  not until the investigation team had arrived in that city to  investigate that the practice was rectified. The plant's actual  industrial output value was 115 million yuan last year, but it  was reported to the city statistical bureau as 173 million yuan.  This represents an exaggeration of 58.34 million yuan,  accounting for 33.7 percent of the reported figure. In the  city's Shaxi Township, the nine village-run industrial  enterprises, which have comparatively large output values,  exaggerated their output value by as much as 25.8 percent of the  total output value of village-run enterprises in the whole  township.    Moreover, some localities have changed the national unified  method of calculation without authorization, causing a false  increase in output value growth rate.    The circular points out: The practice of fraud in  statistical work, in violation of the "Statistical Law," has  deprived the state macroeconomic regulation and control of  reliable, scientific figures. An erroneous policy decision made  on the basis of erroneous information will cause major losses to  the national economy.</p>

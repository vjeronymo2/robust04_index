			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Arts: The Tate goes west - Antony Thorncroft visits the gallery's latest offshoot in St Ives WHAT BRINGS you up short in the newest off-shoot of the Tate Gallery, opening next Saturday in St Ives, is a beach scene. In a wide sweep of breath-taking beauty there is golden sand, an azure sea, and that pellucid light which always makes a St Ives painting so arresting. But this is not a canvas. It is the commanding view from the broad balcony of the museum out towards Porthmeor Beach, one of the finest seascapes in the country. The Museum is built into the cliffs confronting the sea and will act as a beacon for the surfers who roll ashore here. And more than a beacon: the museum has a closet fitted out to accommodate surf boards. If there is a perennial battle between art and nature, the Tate St Ives cannot win. In fact, architects Eldred Evans and David Shelev have totally embraced the outside environment. From the museum's roof-top restaurant you gaze down on the grey slate roofs of the town that appear time and again in the work of the St Ives school artists. Many of the paintings on the wall replicate scenes that can be observed through the port hole windows in a building which, like the topsy turvy, winding and wriggly place it graces, continually comes up with surprises. The Tate St Ives is such an obvious good thing. It enables the Tate to show more of its generous holding of the art of the first, post-1925, St Ives school, of Ben Nicholson, Barbara Hepworth, Christopher Wood and Naum Gabo, plus the second post-war generation of Patrick Heron, Peter Lanyon, Terry Frost, Roger Hilton and more. Within three years, continually changing exhibitions will give all the Tate's 300 hard core St Ives paintings an airing on their home ground, plus many of its 500 works by artists who can generously reckon to have been influenced by St Ives, artists who range from Whistler to Rothko, who both visited. But more than that, the gallery is excellent for St Ives. The town faces a hard choice. There are forces which want to play up its mass tourist attractions, to turn it into a mini-Blackpool. But the museum could pull in an estimated 70,000 visitors a year of a very different stamp, drawn to its heroic artistic history. The graphic attractions of England's toe were first recognised by Turner, but it was the Newlyn School in the late 19th century which made it the centre of plein air, realist painting. In the late 1920s Nicholson and the modernists arrived a few miles away from Newlyn, across the peninsula at St Ives, and artists have never left. Only Hackney, in east London, can boast as many working artists and studios in such a tight community. The Tate St Ives can feed off a thriving professional bedrock, keen to lecture, to educate, to show. It will also provide up to 60 much-needed jobs. It is also good for Cornwall, a depressed county with pitiful arts provision. Now its deputy chief executive Richard Lester can envisage an artistic colony, embracing the whole Penwith peninsula, with the Tate St Ives and the nearby Barbara Hepworth Museum acting as the bait for tourists to a group of 30 art galleries. The idea of a Tate St Ives is attributed to Martin Rewcastle of South West Arts, to Alan Bowness, a former director of the Tate who now runs the Henry Moore Trust (which contributed Pounds 250,000), and to Sir Richard Carew-Powell, whose family have helped lead Cornwall for centuries. They all did their bit, as did the European Commission, whose Pounds 868,000 contribution to the Pounds 3.3m project was the essential glue. Fortunately the museum was built on the site of an abandoned gas works, which brought Pounds 450,000 of Government aid for rehabilitating a derelict site. By the end the money came from public, private, and corporate sources, from local, national and international cashboxes. On Wednesday another Pounds 150,000 plus should be raised from an auction at Sotheby's consisting mainly of donated works by St Ives artists. A Pounds 1.50 admission charge will meet most of the Pounds 250,000 annual running costs. What do the visitors get for their money? It is a small museum, with just over a hundred works on view, and not at all didactic. After all, these are generally intimate paintings, with subdued colours. They may be in the modernist tradition, but created at a stage when modernism was still exploring new possibilities. They represent a concept as well as a place, but St Ives is still the hero - the works gain extra relevance from the immediate views out to sea from the gallery, over the town from the restaurant roof. Virtually all the works on display were painted within a mile of the gallery. The entrance is dominated by the first large coloured glass window created by Patrick Heron, part gift, part commission. Another contemporary 'St Ives' artist, Terry Frost, is contributing a hanging. Then up to a gallery of the first St Ives school, with all the familiar names and, for the opening, a major Lanyon. This selection will be changed annually. Another gallery is devoted to the post-War painters, while the remaining three smaller areas are given over to special exhibitions. The most distinctive in the early months is a rarely seen series of paintings and drawings of patients captured by Barbara Hepworth when she worked in a hospital during the War. The main concourse is also an eye grabber - a display of the pots of Bernard Leach and Hamada, whose contribution to the current international success of British studio ceramics is greater than the relevance of the St Ives painters. For Nick Serota, director of the Tate Gallery, the out station in St Ives is a cause of much pleasure and some concern. He knows from his experience with the Tate Liverpool that, like all off-spring, they turn to their parent for extra financing if plans go awry. Liverpool still absorbs around Pounds 300,000 from his annual grant. With his mind fixed on the new Tate Gallery of Modern Art in London, Serota does not want a debilitating drain on his limited funds or time. On the other hand any opportunity to air works from the 80 per cent of the Tate's stock that languishes in store is obviously a good thing. The Tate St Ives has gone through with amazing speed and few setbacks. It brings timely attention to perhaps the last regional school of British art to have an international impact. It gives Establishment blessing to a thriving community of artists working in a deprived region. Plans for a local artist in residence are well advanced. There will be a busy educational programme. St Ives will not act as a model, but as an example. Already the local arts lobby in Norwich is talking to the Tate about a similar link, although this time in the existing Norwich museum. And if anyone ever needed an excuse to visit St Ives, here is one that would satisfy the most demanding traveller.</p>

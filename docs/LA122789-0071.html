			<p><P> December 27, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NO EVIDENCE OF NORIEGA SECRET AGAINST BUSH  </P> <P> "George Bush is my friend," deposed dictator Manuel A. Noriega once told an  interviewer. "I hope he becomes President."  </P> <P> Some friendship. For almost two years, ever since two U.S. grand juries  indicted him on drug-trafficking charges, the former Panamanian leader has  gleefully launched rumors that he holds some dark secret over the President's  head, dating either from Bush's year as director of the CIA or from his eight  years as vice president.  </P> <P> In a speech during the U.S. presidential campaign last year, Noriega derided  American efforts to negotiate him out of power as an attempt to protect Bush's  White House bid.  </P> <P> And now, Noriega's sly hints have led to speculation that Bush does not really  want to bring him to trial -- even though the President deployed more than  25,000 troops in Panama to oust the former dictator.  </P> <P> But despite two years of rumors and allegations, no evidence has surfaced to  support the idea of a secret Bush-Noriega connection.  </P> <P> Bush himself has called the stories "total lies."  </P> <P> A Democratic-led congressional committee spent more than a year investigating  Noriega's drug operations and found nothing solid that pointed to Bush.  </P> <P> "On the Bush connection, all we could find were rumors," a senior investigator  said.  </P> <P> Dozens of reporters and other congressional investigators have combed through  records and chased down witnesses, and all have come up empty-handed.  </P> <P> "If Noriega had something on Bush, he would have used it before now," argued  Nestor Sanchez, a former senior CIA officer in Latin America.  </P> <P> In fact, some investigators and other officials believe that whatever "secrets"  Noriega once knew about Bush may already have been included in the flood of  revelations that followed the discovery of the Iran-Contra scandal.  </P> <P> "What can Noriega say that's going to be so dangerous?" Sanchez asked. "That he  was on the CIA payroll? That's already been reported. That he met with George  Bush? That's been acknowledged. That he helped (convicted former White House  aide) Ollie North? That's out there too."  </P> <P> Still worrisome to some U.S. officials is the possibility that Noriega, if he  goes on trial in the United States, might attempt to reveal what he knows about  CIA secret operations in Panama and elsewhere in Latin America.  </P> <P> But officials familiar with the case say even that issue is no longer a major  concern. "We crossed that bridge a long time ago," one senior official said.  "We don't think Noriega knows anything that we would find all that  embarrassing."  </P> <P> Still, the issue has been a long-running embarrassment for Bush -- if only  because, as CIA director and as vice president, he was caught in the middle of  an official relationship with Noriega that went spectacularly, and painfully,  sour.  </P> <P> Last year, when Democratic presidential candidate Michael S. Dukakis attacked  Bush for "involving people like Noriega in our foreign policy," Bush responded  by referring testily to that long history.  </P> <P> "Seven Administrations were dealing with Mr. Noriega," he said. "It was the  Reagan-Bush Administration that brought this man to justice."  </P> <P> And, ever since, aides have noted that Bush has taken his confrontation with  Noriega on an unusually personal level. "I've been frustrated that he's been in  power so long -- extraordinarily frustrated," Bush said last week.  </P> <P> Noriega worked with the CIA, the U.S. military and the Drug Enforcement  Administration beginning about 1969, when he became an intelligence officer in  Panama's National Guard, according to former officials. For part of that time,  he was a paid "asset" of the CIA and received tens of thousands of dollars for  his services.  </P> <P> But during the same period, U.S. officials slowly discovered, Noriega was also  working for major South American cocaine smuggling rings, for the intelligence  service of Communist Cuba -- and for himself.  </P></p>

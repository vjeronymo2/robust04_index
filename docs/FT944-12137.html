			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Moscow stance on Bosnia worries Nato Nato is worried by Russia's cool reaction to its tough new procedures for carrying out air raids in Bosnia, according to western diplomats. Moscow's position is one of several factors that could cloud the prospects for further joint action by the contact group on Bosnia, which consists of the US, Britain, Russia, France and Germany. Diplomats said Russian diplomats in Brussels had been briefed on the new air strikes policy as soon as it had been formally endorsed by Nato ambassadors last Friday. Nato officials had tried to assure their Russian counterpart that the policy did not take away the 'dual key' system under which any bombing raids in Bosnia have to be approved by the United Nations as well as Nato. However, subsequent Russian comments - suggesting that Nato was grabbing more power for itself - indicated that these assurances were not accepted. Apart from the air strikes policy, strains in the contact group have been highlighted by its members' contrasting reactions to the recent offensive by the Moslem-led Bosnian army. The offensive has been endorsed in Washington and criticised in Moscow, while British officials have pointedly avoided commenting either way. Bosnian Serb forces claimed yesterday to have halted the government's offensive south of Bihac in northwestern Bosnia. UN officials reported intensifying exchanges of mortar, machinegun and artillery fire around Bihac, which is supposed to be a UN-protected safe area. On Tuesday night, Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, said the Moslems would be 'trounced militarily'. He blamed Belgrade for the biggest Serb setbacks since the start of the fighting 31 months ago. President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia imposed an embargo against Bosnian Serbs three months ago, and he is also trying to prod rebel Serbs from neighbouring Croatia into making a deal with Zagreb. Mr Karadzic said the losses were 'largely the consequence of the. . . blockade'. Sources close to the Bosnian Serb leadership yesterday said the defeats were the 'result of treasonable conduct by some Bosnian Serb officers dictated from Belgrade'. It was unclear whether Mr Karadzic's warning of a 'fifth column' was aimed at high-ranking Bosnian Serb officers who, despite the embargo, still receive their pay from the Yugoslav army. He said that 'anyone who spread rumours or lies about a Serbian sell-out would be shot'. South of Sarajevo, Bosnian Croats and Moslems co-ordinated an attack on the strategic plateau round Kupres, known as the 'door to Bosnia'. The Bosnian Croat entrance into the war casts a pall over peace talks set to resume today between Zagreb and rebel Serbs from Croatia.</p>

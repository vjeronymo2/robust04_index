			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / Bullishness in Buenos Aires: John Barham assesses new confidence in Argentine investment MR Domingo Cavallo, Argentina's economy minister, confidently predicts that his country is on the verge of investment growth the like of which it has not seen since the eve of the third world debt crisis. He expects investments to double by the end of this year to 20 per cent of gross domestic product from 10 per cent last year. If he is right, it would be as significant an achievement as the defeat of hyperinflation. It would ensure a long life for his market-oriented reforms by generating the 6 per cent a year growth he has targetted and rekindling Argentina's hopes of joining the developed world. Investment rates have fallen to sub-Sahara African levels since they peaked at 22.8 per cent of GDP in 1980 - a large part of which was hugely wasteful public sector capital spending financed by a rising foreign debt. The result has been a visibly collapsing infrastructure, obsolete industry and worsening poverty. The economy is still the same size as in 1980, but the population has increased by 14 per cent since then. Now it is all change. The atmosphere for investment has rarely been so good: inflation has fallen to 19 per cent a year, the economy has been thrown open to free competition and the government has scrapped laws that discriminated against foreign investment. Not everybody shares Mr Cavallo's optimism but something is stirring in the rotten hulk of Argentina's economy. Companies are retooling as they slowly regain confidence. New apartment blocks are sprouting all over Buenos Aires, a capital city that has seen hardly any new building for more than a decade. Business consultants and investment bankers are overwhelmed with work re-organising chaotic corporate structures and tangled finances. Investment is being focused in three areas. First, in newly-privatised utilities, which are expected to invest the equivalent of Dollars 32.93bn in the next eight years, comparable with an average of 2.3 per cent of GDP a year. Fiel, an industry-funded thinktank, says infrastructure investments made by private companies should be far more productive than the corrupt state, which it reckons to have wasted Dollars 35bn-plus in 1970-1991. Second, investment is being channelled into the services sector where profit margins are still attractive. Money is going into shopping centres, housing, tourism and entertainment - almost any sector shielded from the avalanche of imports that began pouring into Argentina 18 months ago. Last comes industry. Although hard data do not exist, Mr Cavallo points to indicators, such as the 123 per cent increase in capital goods imports to Dollars 1.11bn in 1991. This confirms anecdotal evidence that cautious businessmen are retooling to increase productivity of existing plant before beginning any ambitious greenfield investments. It is difficult to estimate what part of the hoped-for investment recovery might be from abroad. However, foreign direct investment, which peaked at Dollars 927m in 1981 before the debt crisis, is showing firm signs of recovery. Last year it was up to Dollars 465m, compared with Dollars 333m in 1990. Despite these encouraging trends, there are a number of disturbing signs. To begin with, most independent economists disagree with Mr Cavallo's optimistic forecasts. They estimate investment at only 12-14 per cent of GDP, doubting whether it will reach 20 per cent of GDP this year, and expect growth of just 2-3 per cent a year. Industrialists also complain that the government is not doing enough to encourage investment in export-oriented manufacturing. Most industrial investment is taking place in sectors that do not compete with imports or are aimed at meeting domestic demand. They question the promises by Mr Cavallo of improvement in the economy's overall efficiency. Argentina remains an inefficient, high-cost economy unable to compete internationally except in agricultural commodities. Wages are high and productivity low and the crumbling infrastructure is a serious drag on profitability. What is worrying is that Argentina's experience so far with privatisation has resulted in inefficient and costly services, rather than the reverse. Mr Jose Luis Machinea, a respected opposition economist, adds that investment seems to be funded mainly from foreign sources and he warns this could have an 'enormous impact on the balance of payments in future years'. He reckons Argentina needs to import at least Dollars 5bn in capital this year and Dollars 8bn-Dollars 9bn in 1993. He warns that this may be unsustainable if investors lose confidence in Mr Cavallo's reforms. One source of concern is a deteriorating trade balance. Argentina ran a Dollars 302m trade deficit during the first quarter this year and could register its first annual deficit since 1981. If that does happen, confidence in government policy could be shaken. Another concern is that business people may lack the skills to survive in a stable, open economy. Mr Eugenio Reynal, a director of Merchant Bankers Asociados, an investment bank, says: 'Companies are realising they lack the management to deal with change. There really are very serious problems with management.' What's more, Argentina has never created a stable business environment. Laws, rules, regulations - even ministers and entire policies - can shift with bewildering unpredictability. Mr Miguel Angel Broda, a leading management consultant, says political concern is rising, now that the government is under increasing pressure to dilute reform as incomes fall, demand weakens and businesses fail. He says: 'The question is - will (President Carlos) Menem stand firm? We are entering an 18-month period of risk. I think his survival instinct will make him fight for stability.'</p>

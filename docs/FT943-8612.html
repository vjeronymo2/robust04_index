			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / International Company News: Bilspedition to sell stake in shipping unit Bilspedition, Scandinavia's biggest freight-forwarding group, yesterday announced plans to offer Dollars 50m worth of shares in its Atlantic Container Line shipping unit to international investors. It also said it would seeking a listing for the company on the Oslo Stock Exchange. The moves are in line with the Swedish group's decision to pull out of shipping to concentrate on its core transport, forwarding and logistics businesses. It has been through a period of heavy restructuring after suffering heavy losses from property and shipping in 1992, and sees the recent improvement in ACL's performance and prospects as a good opportunity to sell. A total of 5m shares will be offered to investors in the US, UK and Norway at between Dollars 9 and Dollars 11 each. Proceeds will be used to strengthen the balance sheet of ACL which operates a roll-on roll-off shipping service across the North Atlantic. Mr Hakan Larsson, Bilspedition chief executive, said ACL had made its first profit since the 1980s during the first half of 1994, helped by cost-cutting, rising freight volumes and price rises. 'The market is now stable and the economic climate is expected to continue to improve in both Europe and the US over the next few years,' he stated. Liner shipping on the North Atlantic has been plagued by overcapacity and low rates in recent years, although the problems have been substantially addressed by the formation of the Transatlantic Agreement, a collaborative arrangement between many of the big operators on the route to promote price stability. Bilspedition, which had gross turnover of SKr30bn (Dollars 3.86bn) last year, will retain a 17 per cent stake in ACL. Disposal of the rest of its stake is expected to cut interest-bearing liabilities, which stood at SKr5.46bn at the end of last year, by SKr735m. The decision to list ACL in Oslo reflects the city's importance as a centre of international shipping. The issue is being promoted by Fearnley Fonds A/S.</p>

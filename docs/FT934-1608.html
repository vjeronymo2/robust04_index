			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / International Company News: HKSE to introduce regulated short-selling The Hong Kong Stock Exchange is to introduce regulated short-selling on January 3, further underlining its commitment to become an international-league player. However, arbitrage and hedging will initially be heavily limited by a 14-day curb on stock lending, a pre-requisite for short selling. Legislation to extend the 14-day period and to remove stamp duty obligations are expected to be passed by the Legislative Council in the first quarter of the new year. Mr Paul Chow, chief executive of the HKSE, said a pilot scheme would be launched with an initial 16 highly liquid securities, with market capitalisations above HKDollars 10bn (USDollars 1.3bn). Stocks designated in the first raft to come on stream include Cheung Kong (Holdings), Wharf (Holdings), Hongkong Telecommunications and HSBC Holdings. A further five companies will be eligible once they start trading on the automated trading and order-matching system, which came on-line last month. In line with US regulations on short-selling, short sales can only be made at or above the best current ask price quoted in the Automatic Order Matching and Execution System (AMS). This is to prevent the market being driven lower by short-selling activity alone. On top of reporting requirements, members will be banned from 'naked' short-selling, where positions are not covered by borrowed stock. Mr Chow said the introduction of regulated short-selling marks another significant step forward in the exchange's bid to develop a full range of investment products and strategies to increase Hong Kong's attraction as an international finance centre. 'It is also an important indicator of the growing maturity of the Hong Kong market,' he said. Currently, Japan is the only Asian market offering short-selling, but exchanges in both Malaysia and Singapore are exploring the possibility.</p>

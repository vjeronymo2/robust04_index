			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Stella van Rijn report: "Netherlands Antilles Seeks To Curb </F> Arms Trade"]    [Text] P. Atacho, the Netherlands Antillean justice  minister, wants to impose strict restraints on the arms trade.  In the last years, chaos seems to have resulted from a lack of  control, particularly in Curacao. In December, the United  States decided to suspend arms supplies to the Netherlands  Antilles due to the increase in the quantity of weapons entering  the country. Exactly how many is not known.    This prompted the minister to launch an enquiry and to take  measures to stop this proliferation. There are five licensed  arms dealers operating in Curacao, but just two of them were  found to comply with the regulations. The others had more  weapons than authorized and also different kinds of weapons, the  Public Prosecutor' enquiry revealed. The licenses are soon to  be withdrawn and also more strictly controlled. It also seems  that the nine rifle clubs in Curacao are able to independently  import and even export weapons under present regulations. This  will also stop.    The government is to ask the United States to partially lift  the export ban in order to guarantee deliveries to the  government and security bodies.    The illegal arms trade represents a possibly even greater  problem. There have been many armed attacks over the last two  years and sometimes very young children can be seen in the  streets with guns. There is also an increasing tendency for  arguments between (groups of) young people to result in the use  of arms. It is unlikely that these weapons came into  circulation via the legal channels of the licensed arms dealer.    "I have no idea of the extent of illegal arms ownership,"  Minister Atacho declared. Combatting the illegal ownership of  arms is certainly one of the priorities for the police and  intelligence services. "I also see it as a social problem which  is related to the collapse in standards and values in our  society. And everyone must bear a part of the responsibility  for this," the minister stated.</p>

Check printing fees of any type.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> iii.

For example, credit unions offering an account that is free of deposit or withdrawal fees could advertise that fact, as long as the advertisement does not mislead members by implying that the account is free and that no other fee (a monthly service fee, for example) may be charged.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Free for limited time. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  If an account (or a specific account service) is free only for a limited period of time_for example, for one year following the account opening_the account (or service) may be advertised as free as long as the time period is stated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Conditions not related to share accounts. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  Credit unions may advertise accounts as ``free'' for members that meet conditions not related to share accounts, such as the member's age. For example, credit unions may advertise a share draft account as ``free for persons over 65 years old,'' even though a maintenance or activity fee may be assessed on accounts held by members that are 65 or younger.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> (b) Permissible Rates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Tiered-rate accounts.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> An advertisement for a tiered-rate account that states an annual percentage yield must also state the annual percentage yield for each tier, along with corresponding minimum balance requirements. Any dividend rates stated must appear in conjunction with the annual percentage yields for each tier.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Stepped-rate accounts.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> An advertisement that states a dividend rate for a stepped-rate account must state all the dividend rates and the time period that each rate is in effect.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Representative examples.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> An advertisement that states an annual percentage yield for a type of account (such as a term share account for a specified term) need not state the annual percentage yield applicable to every variation offered by the credit union or indicate that other maturity terms are available. In an advertisement stating that rates for an account may vary depending on the amount of the initial deposit or the term of a term share account, credit unions need not list each balance level and term offered. Instead, the advertisement may:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> i. Provide a representative example of the annual percentage yields offered, clearly described as such. For example, if a credit union offers a $25 bonus on all term share accounts and the annual percentage yield will vary depending on the term selected, the credit union may provide a disclosure of the annual percentage yield as follows: ``For example, our 6-month share certificate currently pays a 3.15% annual percentage yield.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ii. Indicate that various rates are available, such as by stating short-term and longer-term maturities along with the applicable annual percentage yields: ``We offer term share certificates of deposit with annual percentage yields that depend on the maturity you choose. For example, our one-month share certificate earns a 2.75% APY. Or, earn a 5.25% APY for three-year share certificate.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> (c) When Additional Disclosures are Required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Trigger terms.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The following are examples of information stated in advertisements that are not ``trigger'' terms:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> i. ``One, three, and five year share certificates available''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ii. ``Bonus rates available''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> iii. ``1% over our current rate,'' so long as the rates are not determinable from the advertisement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> (c)(2) Time Annual Percentage Yield is Offered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Specified recent date.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> If an advertisement discloses an annual percentage yield as of a specified date, that date must be recent in relation to the publication or broadcast frequency of the media used. For example, the printing date of a brochure printed once for an account promotion that will be in effect for six months would be considered ``recent,'' even though rates change during the six-month period. Dividend rates published in a daily newspaper or on television must be a rate offered shortly before (or on) the date the rates are published or broadcast. Similarly, dividend rates published in a daily newspaper or on television must be a rate reflecting either the preceding dividend period, or a prospective rate, and the option chosen should be noted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Pavel Shinkarenko report: "We Are Joining the G-7"] </F>   [Text] During his recent visit to the FRG Boris Yeltsin  discussed with Chancellor Helmut Kohl the prospects for the new,  democratic Russia's integration into the world economy and the  possibilities of its cooperating with Western industrial states.  At the same time the head of the German Government stressed that  Bonn is particularly "in favor of involving Russia as  extensively as possible in the political section of the G-7  meeting" and is willing to hold appropriate talks with its  partners on this.    The FRG chancellor's words along with similar statements by  other world leaders provide unequivocal evidence that, whereas  the West can still do without Moscow economically, it simply  cannot resolve many international political problems without it.  That is why the first real step toward the transformation of  this elite club has already been taken before our country  formally accedes to the G-7. A Russian spokesman -- Sergey  Lavrov, Russian deputy foreign minister -- took part in the  recent consultations in Rome between the diplomatic departments  of Britain, Germany, Italy, Canada, the United States, France,  and Japan on the preparations for the July summit-level meeting  in Naples. Thus Moscow is for the first time a coauthor of the  program of work for the world leaders' council and not just a  "guest of honor."    Our interest in participating in the elite club is  justified.  The regular G-7 meetings dating back to the mid-seventies  constitute one of the most important forums for mutual  consultation on pressing problems of international policy and  the world economy. And it is quite natural that the former  "seven plus one" formula, whereby the head of our state only  joined in the debate at the end of the session once the Western  countries' joint course had been formulated, could not be  effective. Russia's participation at the stage where the agenda  is drawn up is expected to be far more productive.    Italy, which is to chair the coming session in Naples, has  still not announced the range of problems scheduled for  discussion. But it can be assumed that the question of settling  the conflicts in Bosnia and the Near East, the role of the  United Nations and its peacemaking forces in this process, the  state of affairs in Africa, and the development of the political  processes in South Africa, the Asia-Pacific region, and other  parts of the world will top the list. Discussion is also  expected to turn to the situation in the CIS countries,  primarily in the hot spots of Nagorno-Karabakh, Tajikistan,  Georgia, and Abkhazia.    As for the meeting's economic program, that will still be  discussed without Boris Yeltsin's involvement. Nevertheless the  strategic problems involved in Russia's integration in the world  economy which Chancellor Kohl mentioned in particular will  obviously not be ignored. I hope that the Russian president's  words are heeded when the prospect of affording aid for Russia's  reforms is considered. The Russian Foreign Ministry believes,  for instance, that the Naples meeting should discuss the  question not so much of expanding this aid as of the West's  meeting its prior commitments and observing the priorities  formulated with the Russian president's participation at the  previous meetings in Munich and Tokyo. These being support for  reforms, the development of privatization and private business,  an easing of the foreign debt burden, and improved terms for  Russian goods' access to world markets.    Needless to say, one meeting will not be able to drastically  improve the situation for Russia. But it will reflect the trend  within the world community and will thus be another "brick" in  the edifice of good-neighborliness and mutual assistance on our  planet.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A pro-democracy activist claimed yesterday that  officials loyal to the Democrat Party [DP] paid hard cash to  tambon and village chiefs to bus befuddled villagers to  political rallies staged to suggest mass support for beleaguered  Prime Minister Chuan Likphai.    Suphap Phutthongsi, chairman of the Confederation for  Democracy in Loei province, said kamnans (tambon chiefs) and  village headmen in his province were hired by provincial  officials to stage a pro-Chuan rally on Wednesday in front of  the city hall.    The allegation was not confirmed by local officials.    He said kamnans received Bt[baht]300 each, while Bt200 was  paid to the headmen. Car drivers who transported villagers to  the site of the protest received Bt300.    Suphap said he was in no doubt that, the payments had been  made, because the kamnans and headmen had given him the details  personally.    He said the villagers who participated in the orchestrated  show of support had received nothing and some did not even know  what they were supposed to do when they arrived at the protest.  Some of them only went because they already had plans to go  shopping and the offer of a free lift was welcomed.    "Some of them told me they were about to go to their rice  fields but phuyaibans [village headmen] come to pick them up and  take them into town straight away. They didn't even know why  they had to go," he said.    Suphap said the province had spent about Bt200,000 hiring  kamnans and headmen to stage the mass rally against Chalat.    Buawaeng Suphrom-in, village headman of Loei's Chiangkhan  district, said he was ordered by an assistant district chief to  take about 10 villagers to the city.    He said the chief had promised to give him a big sum of  money. But after the rally was over the money had been withheld.    Buawaeng said he personally agreed with Chalat's protest for  fuller democracy.    Rallies in Nakhon Ratchasima, Nakhon Si Thammarat, Nakhon  Phanom, Mukdahan and Rayong continued yesterday.    In Nakhon Ratchasima, more than a thousand people from Wang  Nam Khieo and Kham Thaleso district gathered to show moral  support for Chuan through their chief district officers.    Nakhon Si Thammarat Governor Sucham Phongnua said he was  very  worried that there could be a violent confrontation between  pro-democracy supporters and pro-Chuan demonstrators.    He said he has warned Chalat's supporters to stop using a  loud speaker which was apparently annoying people in Muang  district. He said police would take tough action against anyone  who incited violence in the province.    In Nakhon Phanom, about 10,000 people turned up in front of  the city hall to show their support for Chuan. It was not clear  whether they had been paid to participate, but Governor Sucharit  Patchimnan said the supporters had turned up spontaneously on  their own free will.    About 4,000 people rallied in front of Rayong City Hall and  presented a bouquet of flowers to Chuan through their governor.    Meanwhile, about a thousand people continued their vigil  outside Parliament in support of Chalat as he entered the fourth  week of his fast and came to the end of his "sit-in".    Chalat's daughter Chitrawadi said the Democrat Party would  be  to blame if her father died.    Permanent Secretary for Interior Ari Wong-araya said  Interior  Minister Chawalit Yongchaiyut had ordered him "to take control"  of the situation in front of Parliament.    Ari said Chalat might not die but could be permanently  disabled if he continued his fast.    National Police Chief Pol Gen [Police General] Prathin  Santipraphop said he was worried about traffic conditions on  Uthong Nai Road near the site of Chalat's protest.    A group of about 10 people who called themselves "southern  villagers" yesterday afternoon laid a wreath for Democrat MPs in  front of Parliament.    After Chalat's departure to the Police Hospital, popular  entertainer Yunyong Ophakun continued singing to maintain the  morale of those who had gathered to support Chalat.</p>

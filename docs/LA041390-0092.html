			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> COUNTY BACKS PLAN TO FUND CRIME LABS  </P> <P> Legislation designed to fund an expansion of fingerprint, photograph and  genetic identification databases in Ventura and other counties has been  endorsed by the Ventura County Board of Supervisors.  </P> <P> By doubling the amount of money counties could collect on fines levied by the  courts, the pending legislation would provide funds for an electronic  photograph and fingerprint scanners and a DNA identification system.  </P> <P> Ventura County is now collecting 50 cents for every $10 on all criminal fines  for a statewide fingerprint database.  </P> <P> If passed, the legislation will allow the Sheriff's Department to use the  additional money to purchase electronic scanners that would give law  enforcement officials instant access to mug shots and fingerprints entered into  the system, Lt. John Brockus said.  </P> <P> The funds would also be used to create a laboratory to carry out DNA analysis.  CAROLYN KUSKY  </P></p>

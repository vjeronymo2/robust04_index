			<p>BFN     [Text] In his interview with Interfax Levon Zubaryan, aide  of the Armenian president, reconfirmed the information about the  preparation for a meeting between Armenian and Azerbaijani  presidents on the settlement of the Karabakh conflict scheduled  for the near term in Moscow. At the same time he reported that  the precise date is as yet unknown. According to Zubaryan,  "preparatory diplomatic work is being carried out with the  mediation of the Russian side."    In Zubaryan's words, this meeting has been foreseen by the  protocol signed on the results of the meeting between  representatives of the parliaments of Armenia, Azerbaijan, and  Nagorno-Karabakh under the mediation of the CIS  Inter-Parliamentary Assembly on May 5 in Bishkek.    One of the items of the protocol says that the appeals to  cease fire in the conflict zone should be fixed "in the near  term by signing a reliable and legal agreement which would  stipulate a mechanism preventing resumption of any military and  hostile actions, withdrawal of forces from the occupied  territories, restoration of communications, return of refugees,  and continuation of the negotiation process."</p>

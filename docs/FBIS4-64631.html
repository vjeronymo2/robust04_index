			<p>BFN     [Text] Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said it is  up to the UN Security Council to show determination--as it is  showing on other international issues--or to let the Turkish  intervention in Cyprus slander its image and international law.  The spokesman made his statement to the Cyprus Broadcasting  Corporation commenting on a letter from Turkish Cypriot leader  Rauf Denktas to the UN secretary general. In his letter Denktas  criticizes the UN envoys and says that he is ready to continue  with the talks if the proposals included in the UN documents are  changed.    The spokesman said: In his letter, Denktas is again trying  to implement a policy of delaying. The Greek Cypriot side's  actions and demarches will be made after the UN secretary  general submits his report and the National Council confers. At  the National Council, President Glavkos Kliridhis will explain  his thoughts for discussion and decisionmaking.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Amman, 11 Jun (PETRA)--Yemeni Justice Minister  'Abdallah Ghanim has hailed Jordan's honorable role, its  principled support for its brothers in Yemen, and its continuous  and serious efforts to realize accord between Yemenis.    In a news conference held at Jordan Hotel this morning,  Ghanim said he will convey a message to His Majesty King Husayn  from His Excellency 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, Presidential Council  chairman in the Republic of Yemen.    He added that the message deals with the latest developments  in Yemen and the full implementation of the Security Council  resolution which preserves the territorial integrity of Yemen.  The message also deals with Yemen's insistence on unity and  democracy.    He said his short visit to Jordan is part of a tour of a  number of Arab countries and is aimed to acquaint the Arab  leaders with what is going on in Yemen.    Ghanim said a Yemeni delegation is currently visiting the  Arab Maghreb states, and a Yemeni parliamentary delegation is  visiting the U.S. Congress within the framework of political  efforts by the Yemeni leadership to explain the facts to  brothers and friends and refute the allegations that attempt to  deceive Arab and international public opinions through  portraying the conflict in Yemen as one between the north and  the south, or as an attempt to impose unity by force, while the  fact is that it is a conflict between the Yemeni people and the  rebels and secessionists who carried weapons against the  legitimate regime in order to secede.    Ghanim emphasized that unity was established four years ago  and was not set up by force but through peaceful means. A  referendum on the Constitution of the Republic of Yemen was  conducted mid-1991 on the basis of which elections were held in  1993, so how can it be said after all this that we are imposing  unity by force?    Ghanim said the Yemeni Government unequivocally rejects the  presence of foreign forces in Yemen, and considers the  rebellious side's demand of entrenching secession through the  presence of international forces a blatant aggression against  the sovereignty and independence of unified Yemen.    Ghanim said: We will abort any secessionist effort, and will  work for unity under legitimacy. Our duty is to confront  secession and rebellion on the basis of our constitutional  responsibilities. He emphasized that Yemen is committed to  Security Council Resolution 924, which calls for an immediate  cease-fire if the other party is committed to it.    The minister added: We know that certain parties are  supporting the mutineers' position. We are surprised by this  support, and we urge these parties to stop because it will lead  to more bloodshed. He pointed out that while the legitimate  government forces are demanding the right to affiliation, the  other side is demanding mutiny and secession.    He stressed his categorical rejection of this interference  in  Yemen's domestic affairs, and said that Yemen would find itself  compelled to reply in an appropriate way if that interference in  its national sovereignty continued.    During his news conference, he touched on threats from  certain sides, and said that they constitute plots against Yemen  and its legitimacy. The Yemeni official appealed to the Arab  League, the UN Security Council, and all the fraternal and  friendly countries to confront those who wish to peddle these  plots.    He said: We are against any measure or interference that  would prolong the war and lead to secession, stressing that  Yemen's legitimacy is seeking dialogue within the framework of  Yemen's unity. No party alone, he said, has the right to  represent that legitimacy and no one has the right to disrupt  unity or even argue outside the framework of Yemeni legitimacy.    He added: We will reject the division or fragmentation of  Yemen by any party, pointing out that international legitimacy  has not so far dealt with us in accordance with the UN  principles or Charter but in accordance with temporary and  political interests.    He also said: I attended the deliberations the Security  Council's members held before Resolution No. 924 was issued, and  I sensed the extent of encroachment exercised against world  nations in violation of the principles advocated by the United  Nations. Resolutions, he said, are being taken in light of  bargains and flattery and apart from peoples' rights and states'  right to noninterference in their domestic affairs. The  council, he added, also uses double standards.    Ghanim then praised the role of the Jordanian king,  government, and people in maintaining Yemen's unity and  territorial integrity. He also praised Jordan's media, which  have stressed their objective support for right and media which  the Yemeni citizen views as friendly.</p>

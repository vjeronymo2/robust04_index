			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Appeal against Bank set to be lost THE BANKING Appeals Tribunal is expected today to reject a complaint against the Bank of England for petitioning to close Mount Banking, a small Asian-owned bank. Mount Banking asked the tribunal to examine the reasons for the Bank of England's petition to a High Court judge which led to it being placed in provisional liquidation in October last year. The tribunal's findings are expected to be circulated in a report today after hearings held last month under the auspices of the Lord Chancellor's department. It was chaired by Mr Jonathon Mance QC, with two 'wing' members: Mr Christopher Swinson, an accountant, and Mr Nicholas Clegg, a banker. The tribunal is believed to have been the first to sit since it was instituted as part of an appeals process in the 1987 Banking Act. Previous cases have been launched but all have been settled before a tribunal has been formally convened. The appeal was requested by the principal shareholders in Mount, Mr Navinchandra Bhagwanji Shah and Mr Suresh Bhagwanji Shah. The findings are expected to generate interest from critics of the Bank of England's regulatory role, who are sceptical of the tribunal's independence.</p>

			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russian problem may hit grain prices DESPITE MURMURS about possible debt rescheduling it appears that Russia's difficulties paying back its US grain loans will not be resolved before the end of the month, leaving the country ineligible for a Dollars 275m infusion of new loans the US Department of Agriculture had planned to release on January 1. The credit problems have shut Russia, the US's second-largest customer, out of the grain market and could have grave implications for North American wheat and maize prices if they linger on after the new year. While both Russia and the USDA initially tried to put a temporary face on the problems, grain traders say there is little hope Russia will be able to come up with enough hard cash to become current on the accelerating payments. Exporters and their bankers are looking to the Paris Club for a resolution, saying the international body could choose to include a principal payment deferral on the grain loans as part of a larger package of Russian debt rescheduling. 'The rescheduling will have the effect of making them current, though no money is changing hands,' says one banker familiar with Russia's US farm loans. However, international debt negotiations are moving more slowly than expected even a month ago. Political wrangling between Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, and the Russian Parliament has made recession-weary international bankers reluctant to offer fresh financing, despite Mr Yeltsin's commitment to democracy and a free-market economy. It now appears that Paris Club action on Russia's debt will have to wait until Russia and the International Monetary Fund have completed a full scale financing agreement. In the meantime the change in US government will prevent any unilateral policy changes before the presidential inauguration on January 20. Washington farm interests are lobbying for direct farm aid to Russia to replace the guaranteed, short-term loan programme. As of yesterday morning, the country was Dollars 40.1m in arrears on its US-backed farm loans, with a balance of Dollars 199m due by the end of the month. It has been suspended from the loan programme since December 1. Overall, Russia owes about Dollars 4.5bn for the three-year loan programme that began in January, 1991, with nearly Dollars 2bn falling due in 1993. Its suspension has left Dollars 81m of unused wheat credits and Dollars 30mn in pork credits sitting on the books at the USDA. The Dollars 275m in new credits was designated for a variety of commodities, including wheat and feed grains. Even worse, exporters say banks have been reluctant to pay on already-opened letters of credit from the Russian central bank, putting previous sales and scheduled shipments in jeopardy. Russia's grain loan problems are not unique to purchases from the US. The Canadian Wheat Board has not shipped grain to Russia since early October. Mr Brian Stacey, a Wheat Board spokesman, says Russia has used its maximum of Dollars 1.5bn in revolving credit, and while it has been making payments, they have not been sufficient to cover substantial interest on the loans. Russia represents about one fifth of Canada's export grain market, giving Canada a particular interest in resolving the country's debt problems. 'The problem may be beyond Canada,' says one Wheat Board official, however. 'It requires a co-ordinated solution among countries.' US grain merchants are still counting on Russia as a buyer in 1993, although purchases may be delayed until late in the marketing year, distorting prices and disrupting the export 'pipeline'. Mr Richard Feltes, grain analyst with Refco, says Russia has 1.5m tonnes of US maize and 800,000 tonnes of US wheat purchased and waiting to be shipped, along with 130,000 of soyameal. The country had been expected to buy 2.25m tonnes of US maize between January and August and 3m tonnes of wheat between January and May. Soyameal purchases were projected at 385,000 tonnes to the end of September. If Russia is precluded from loading any more US grain, Mr Feltes says, the negative price effects will be felt most strongly in the wheat markets, where supply and demand have been closely in balance, and where the carryover in the US had been projected at a slim 498m bushels. While US farmers will suffer if the Soviet grain market is limited, the loss of North American imports is not expected to generate a food crisis in Russia this winter. Russia's own harvest was near a record this year, reducing its import needs by nearly a third, and its grain buyers contracted sufficient supplies before the debt crisis to cover nearby needs, Soviet specialists say.</p>

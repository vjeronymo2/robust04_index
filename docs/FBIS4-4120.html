			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 27 (XINHUA)--A 2,500-cu-m [cubic  meter] blast furnace went into operation Tuesday [26 April]  afternoon at the Maanshan Iron and Steel Co. Ltd, one of the  country's major iron and steel producers, in east China's Anhui  Province.    At 3:18 P.M. on Tuesday, the furnace successfully produced  molten iron.    The total investment in the furnace reached three billion  yuan (about 345 million U.S. dollars).    The designed annual output of the furnace is 1.75 million  tons. With this furnace in production, the company will be able  to double its annual output to four million tons of iron and  steel. This also paves the way for it to increase its annual  output to six million tons of iron and steel.</p>

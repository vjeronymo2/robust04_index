			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Lead and zinc smelters cut capacity Lead and zinc smelters are being forced to shut production capacity because concentrates, their essential raw materials, are in short supply. Concentrates are intermediate materials produced by mines and shortages are building up because many mines have been closed, victims of low metal prices. Asturiana de Zinc of Spain, which has an annual capacity of 320,000 tonnes, enough to satisfy about 6 per cent of western world demand, is the latest producer to announce cuts. It said its zinc output would be reduced by 70,000 tonnes next year. The company already had been forced to cut production by 10,000 tonnes a month in November and December. Asturiana blamed concentrate shortages for its decision but some traders pointed out that at present it was discussing 1994 supplies with mines around the world and that the announcement might have been a negotiating ploy. They also suggested that the concentrate shortage was only just begining to bite in the zinc market. However, the situation was more severe for lead. Mitsubishi Materials Corporation of Japan said this week that it would close its only lead smelting and refining plant in April next year - the plant is Japan's third-largest with an annual output of about 30,000 tonnes. 'Adverse market conditions and other factors have made continued operation of the facility uneconomical,' the group said. In particular, Japan's decision to cut its tariffs on lead imports to 3 per cent from 9.1 per cent as a result of the Uruguay round of international trade talks contributed to this decision. Ms Karen Norton, analyst at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, part of the Royal Dutch/Shell group, estimates that, with the Mitsubishi closure, about 130,000 tonnes of refined lead production cuts have already been announced for 1994 compared with cuts of about 170,000 this year. One of the other companies to have announced cuts, MIM of Australia, said it was to shut one of its two Mt Isa smelters next year because its stock of concentrates was running low. The latest statistics from the International Lead and Zinc Study Group show that in the first ten months of this year mine production of lead was down by 10.7 per cent or 205,000 tonnes to 1.7m tonnes while production of refined lead eased by only 1.1 per cent to 3.68m tonnes. Mine output of zinc dropped by 9.3 per cent, or 439,000 tonnes, to 4.29m tonnes while refined zinc production slipped by only 0.7 per cent to 4.55m tonnes.</p>

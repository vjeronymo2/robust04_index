			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Gatt's the best we've got, so don't junk it, says new ITC chief - 'Old Ugly is better than Old Nothing.' MR DON Newquist, the new chairman of the US International Trade Commission (ITC), is not a fan of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) but has nevertheless concluded that 'Old Ugly is better than Old Nothing'. (Texan-to-English translation: 'The current international trading system is preferable to no system.') 'I see the Gatt as unwieldy, ineffective, and I damn sure wouldn't want my money at risk in that type of decision-making environment,' he said. 'Even saying that, it's the best you got. Don't junk it.' Nor does the former Texas businessman much like the reforms proposed by Mr Arthur Dunkel, Gatt's director-general: 'If I were a member of Congress, I'd be seriously concerned about turning over the administration of my trade laws to an international bureaucrat in Geneva. In fact, I wouldn't do it]' The ITC is the independent agency designated to rule on complaints by US businesses which believe that they have been injured by imports. It is supposed to be both non-partisan and non-political. Commissioners serve nine-year terms; no more than three of the six members can be from one political party. Mr Newquist is the first Democrat chairman since Mrs Paula Stern served from 1984-86. The Republican Reagan and Bush administrations ignored the legislative intent by appointing 'independents' thought to be free-traders and as few Democrats as possible. The new chairman calls himself 'Texas all the way'. He was born there in 1943, growing up in a Swedish Lutheran community. Living on a farm concentrated his mind on getting a job in town. He attended college in Texas, served in Vietnam, and progressed in his business career mostly in Texas, until he asked Texan Senator Lloyd Bentsen for a job in Washington. Mr Bentsen is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, which holds jurisdiction over trade matters; so, in 1988, Mr Newquist ended up at the ITC, an agency of which he had not heard until he had come to the capital with a group of oil industry lobbyists. He still seems a stranger in the world of 'dumping margins,' 'de minimus' and 'culmination', acknowledging he relies heavily on his staff in legal matters. Mr Newquist is intensely interested in the politics of trade, and the talk ranges from the North American Free Trade Agreement (which, like most other Texans, he favours strongly) to Gatt Plus (a proposal by Senator Bentsen for those countries which want to sign up for stronger trade rules than are agreed in Gatt). He favours 'levelling the playing field' for US companies which have to bear the burden of environmental costs. Mr Bentsen said he recommended Mr Newquist for a commission seat to provide a business angle. Mrs Stern says it is 'valuable' to have someone on the board who knows how a company's fortunes can depend on ITC decisions. Mr Newquist tends to vote for domestic industries rather than against them. Mrs Stern said that under the Reagan and Bush administrations, trade was politicised, relief being granted to industries only when politically expedient. This signalled the White House would only act 'when kicked'. Ultimately, Senator Bentsen refused to approve any presidential appointees until Mr Bush nominated a Democrat chairman and ensured three members from each of the two parties. Now, Mr Newquist hopes to promote more open debate.</p>

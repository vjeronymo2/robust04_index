			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Falling gold prices keep Monarch earnings in red LOWER GOLD prices and reduced output kept Monarch Resources, the London-quoted mining and exploration company with operations in Venezuela, in the red in the first half of 1992. The pre-tax loss was USDollars 1.87m or 12.8 cents, compared with Dollars 1.88m or 13.3 cents in 1991. Gold production was 11,561 troy ounces, in line with the corresponding 11,723 ounces but well below the 13,771 ounces achieved in the second half of last year. The drop was due to a reduction in economically available raw material for the company's Revemin plant in Venezuela. Mr Tony Ciali, chief executive, said Revemin also suffered from increased costs, mainly due to inflation. This left the plant with an operating loss of Dollars 437,000 in the period (Dollars 14,000 loss) and an operating cash flow deficit of Dollars 50,000 (Dollars 509,000 surplus). Management was urgently looking for new sources of material to feed the plant, he added. In July, Monarch raised Pounds 20m through a rights issue, principally to fund the 24-month development of the La Camorra gold project in Venezuela. Mr Michael Beckett, chairman, said development was on schedule and under budget so far. A general manager started work in August.</p>

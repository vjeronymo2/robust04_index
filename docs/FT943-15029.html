			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Channel 4 to lift spending Channel 4 plans to end a three-year freeze on its programme budgets and commit a further Pounds 20m over 18 months. Because of the recession the channel's programme budget has been stuck at Pounds 184m since 1991. This represents a substantial drop in real terms because as well as being hit by inflation and the rising price of programmes bought from the US, Channel 4's budget now also has to cover schools programmes. Mr John Willis, the channel's director of programmes, said yesterday that competition between Channel 4, ITV, the BBC and British Sky Broadcasting - in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a significant stake - had pushed up prices by between 60 per cent and 70 per cent in the past two years. Channel 4 has, for example, had to pay about Dollars 120,000 (Pounds 80,000) per one-hour episode for the 22 episodes of ER, a hospital drama that will probably be called Emergency Resuscitation when it is shown next year. The extra Pounds 20m spending over 18 months will be spread across the range, with special emphasis on UK drama and children's programmes. Mr Willis said every Channel 4 department would be able to commission the equivalent of three extra documentaries or one short series. Last year Channel 4 won a 10.98 per cent share of total viewing. Until the start of the World Cup - which will probably depress the channel's total audience temporarily - the share had settled at 10.84 per cent.</p>

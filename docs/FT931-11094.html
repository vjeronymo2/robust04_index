			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Arts: After 30 years Alec McCowen returns to the RSC The return of Alec McCowen, after three decades, to play Prospero in The Tempest; Robert Stephens as Lear; Max Stafford Clark directing The Country Wife and Ian Judge Love's Labour's Lost; new productions of Murder in the Cathedral and Goldoni's The Venetian Twins, are among the highlights of the Royal Shakespeare Company's 1993 Stratford season, announced yesterday. There will also be a new play by David Pownall, Elgar's Rondo, starring McCowen as the composer. At the Barbican in London the RSC is playing safe with successful transfers from Stratford, like The Beggar's Opera, As You Like It, Antony and Cleopatra and Tamburlaine the Great Later in the year comes the interesting revivals with Tom Stoppard's Travesties, directed by RSC artistic director Adrian Noble, Schiller's The Death of Wallenstein, and a London premiere for Alan Ayckbourn's dark comedy Wildest Dreams There will also be a world premiere of Misha's Party written jointly by the American playwright Richard Nelson and the Russian Alexander Gelman and set in Moscow just before the 1991 coup attempt. Although audiences in the past year, at 80 per cent, were slightly above 1991 and the RSC will break even in the 1992-93 season, Noble is cautious in his repertoire. The recession; an accumulated deficit of Pounds 2.5m; and the knowledge that the RSC will lose its Pounds 700,000 a year in sponsorship from Royal Insurance after the 1993-94 season, have persuaded him to reduce the new productions at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre to four. However the Royal Shakespeare Theatre is currently undergoing a Pounds 400,000 facelift, including new seats. A boost for the RSC has come from English Estates, which is to sponsor the regional tour of Julius Caesar to small venues, like sports halls. The cost will be in excess of Pounds 100,000.</p>

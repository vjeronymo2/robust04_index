			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Observer: Runway rumpus Does UK corporate affairs minister Neil Hamilton have a conflict of interest? Along with the rest of the trade and industry department's top team, he has been given a regional responsibility - north-west England - which includes his Tatton constituency. Although one of the north's most salubrious areas, Tatton is under Manchester Airport's flight-path. Hence Hamilton's honorary vice-presidency of the Knutsford and Mobberley Joint Action Group trying to stop the building of a second runway. The group uses such unparliamentary words as 'rapists' when referring to the airport's management. Airport chairman Jack Flanagan, a Manchester Labour councillor, has retaliated by calling on Hamilton to resign either from the government or from the action group. Flanagan says any trade and industry minister must be in favour of the extension to the airport, now claimed to be the north-west's leading economic generator with up to 81,000 jobs in prospect. Hamilton denies any conflict of interest as the planning decision will be taken by the environment department, not his own. He also says Liverpool's Labour councillors - who want their city's under-used airport developed instead - would support him. Who would ever have expected a Tory minister to recruit Liverpool as an ally?</p>

			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / World Trade News: EU accused of Gatt violations on fish The European Union was accused yesterday by the US of acting in violation of Gatt rules by imposing new restrictions on imports of white fish, following recent violent protests by French fishermen. At a meeting of Gatt's governing council, the US complained that in the wake of French moves to disrupt fish trade the EU had 'unilaterally and, we believe, illegally' notified trading partners of restrictions on fish imports at prices below reference levels. EU officials said the restrictions, which apply to white fish from all sources, especially cod, haddock, coalfish, hake, monkfish and Alaska pollack, were in response to a crisis in the fish market. The minimum import price scheme, introduced on February 5 and due to end on March 15, was designed to stabilise the market and prevent price declines. Brazil took issue with US plans to subsidise 25,000 tonnes of soyabean oil exports to China, which it said ran counter to the spirit of the accords limiting agricultural export subsidies. The US said the amount was less than 2 per cent of China's total annual imports of vegetable oils. Australia expressed concern the US might be tempted to make increased use this year of its export subsidy scheme, the export enhancement programme, to reduce farm surpluses before the Uruguay Round comes into effect.</p>

			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / UK Mining Closures: Cabinet version of events revised DOWNING Street yesterday sought to salvage something from the public relations wreckage surrounding this week's pits closure announcement by insisting that most members of the cabinet had been informed before the decision was made public. Delivering the third version in as many days of the precise mechanics of the decision, officials said Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, had forewarned colleagues of the announcement at a cabinet committee meeting on Tuesday morning. The committee - on overseas policy and defence - had been attended by all but four cabinet ministers. Those absent were Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, Lord Chancellor, Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment secretary, and Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary. Downing Street said Mr Heseltine had informed the group that the announcement - originally planned for next week - was being brought forward at the request of British Coal to end uncertainty. The officials stressed also that a number of senior ministers - including Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, and Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary - had been involved for several weeks in talks with Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Mr Heseltine on the scale of the closures. Others such as Mr Peter Lilley, social services secretary, had been brought in to the discussions at various points. But the explanation, which followed days of confusion as to why Thursday's cabinet meeting had been asked merely to rubber stamp such an important decision, failed to dispel disquiet among some ministers about the apparent ability of British Coal to 'bounce' Mr Heseltine into an early announcement.</p>

			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Steelmakers hammer Rexrodt: Tough conditions for accord put before Bonn minister The German steel federation yesterday set tough conditions for its backing of a European steel restructuring plan in a meeting with Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the economics minister. The conditions included guarantees that steelmakers receiving subsidies to cut capacity would not be able to increase their shares in the European steel market and that the agreement would be properly monitored. 'We remain ready to contribute to the European steel restructuring plan. But politicians must ensure these decisive conditions,' the federation said in a statement after the meeting. The federation also insisted that the European steel restructuring scheme 'had not failed yet', but added that the plan 'remained in danger of failing'. It appeared eager to tone down pessimistic statements voiced across the industry, saying that the European steel restructuring plan was doomed because private steelmakers were not willing to offer significant capacity cuts. The European Union plan aims to cut 30m tonnes of crude steel in the European market. However, sources in the German steel industry yesterday said that these conditions were unlikely to be met and that the federation was indulging in 'wishful thinking'. Officials at Thyssen Stahl, Germany's largest steel producer, yesterday reiterated that they would not offer any capacity cuts in flat steel products. 'We will never give up flat products capacity,' a senior official at the company said. Industry sources said no common position had been reached between the big unsubsidised German producers, which include Krupp-Hoesch and Preussag. 'We still need to talk to one another and it is too early to say what will come out of these talks,' a leading steel manufacturer said. Private steelmakers say that they have already implemented large capacity cuts. They say capacity cuts in public sector manufacturers do not go far enough and are allowing subsidised companies to win market shares at the expense of the private sector.</p>

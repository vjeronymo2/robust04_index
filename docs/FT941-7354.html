			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / PM to counter attacks on tax The prime minister and the chancellor are to launch an onslaught on what they call the 'mythology' of Tory tax rises in the next few days, as Labour continues to accuse the government of disguising the impact of tax increases and cuts in public expenditure. Mr John Major and Mr Kenneth Clarke are determined to counter the Labour party's claim that the level of taxation under the Conservatives is greater than it was under the last Labour government. Mr Major will emphasise at the Conservatives' Local Government Conference on Saturday that tax rises imposed in the last Budget were intended to reduce the budget deficit, while taxation under Labour simply promoted bigger spending plans. He will say that the effect of the November Budget will be to take less cash out of the economy than Labour claims. The speeches will coincide with a fresh Labour attack on the Budget. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, said yesterday that government figures had shown a fall in real disposable income of the poorest social groups in the past 15 years. At prime minister's question time in the Commons Mr Smith claimed that Social Trends, published by the Department of Social Security, showed that since 1979 the real income of the bottom 10 per cent of the population - about 6m people - had decreased both before and after housing costs were taken into account. The prime minister countered Mr Smith's claim, saying that real incomes had 'gone up sharply' for vulnerable groups since 1979 - 'over 40 per cent for pensioners, up for the unemployed, up for those in work and up for those in work but on relatively low pay as well.'</p>

			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Arts: Laurie Anderson and David Byrne - Pop Two niche brands from New York, both with rather dodgy sell-by dates, have been marketing themselves hard in London this week. Laurie Anderson, big in 1981 but as minimal as her music since, has a new book. David Byrne, driving force behind Talking Heads, the po-faced students' band of the 1980s, was plugging David Byrne, the album. Anderson got caught in the performance art web and has never escaped. She still sits solemnly at her electronic keyboard; she still has mastery over the same note; she still chants, in her hypnotic drawl, well-rounded nonsense. Her 90 minute monologue at Sadler's Wells was 'what I did on my holidays'. 'In 1987 I went to Mexico to see my brother' and then on to an anecdote about primitive Mayans mistaking her contact lenses for jewels that she hid in her body. Most of her tales are less exciting: many are downright banal; some test credibility, especially the Arctic family who eat possum smeared with maple syrup while their children disappear down mining shafts. Anderson brazenly reads from her book, entitled Stories from the Nerve Bible, her fanciful name for the body, occasionally switching from her natural voice to an electronic mike which catapults her from bass profondo to squeaky soprano. Sometimes she sings. In the hushed, reverential, atmosphere it is all but impossible not to nod off - but, oh so, beautifully. You expect Laurie Anderson to be out-to-lunch and you enjoy the test of wills between her kookiness and the credulity of the audience. David Byrne had a harder task at the Palladium, introducing introspective new songs to unregenerate Talking Heads fans. I felt sorry for the chap who stood up ready to boogie: he had to wait for the fourth encore before Byrne had mustered enough enthusiasm from the audience. Byrne, now with long hair, sings bleak songs with even bleaker settings, performed by a trio of guitars and percussion. Actually they grow on you, but at first sounding are rather relentless. Of course the lyrics are startling: 'I met my love at a funeral' begins 'Crash'; 'Running naked down the state highway' opens the more hopeful, indeed evangelistic, 'Buck naked'. But the more you get down to the words the more you feel Byrne is going for easy fixes. The lyrics sound important but fall apart. The salvation is in the rhythms, the Latin tinge to 'Sad Song', for example, which, with 'Lilies of the Valley', is the song most likely to ingratiate itself quickly with Byrne's now rather mature cult following. Perhaps in a smoky club it might have clicked, but at this palace of variety Byrne came across as a rather serious family man in his early forties half heartedly taking on world issues to fulfil a contract. There is actually little Byrne offers in performance that adds to his CD, except perhaps a tendency to sing flat. The great thing about Talking Heads was that the name said it all.</p>

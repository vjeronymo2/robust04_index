			<p><P> December 29, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MEDFLY FOUND; SPRAYING ZONE TO BE WIDENED  </P> <P> State agriculture officials said Thursday that they have discovered a fertile  Mediterranean fruit fly in Monrovia and will add nearly 20 square miles to the  area to be sprayed with the pesticide malathion next month.  </P> <P> A mated female fly was found in an area north of Foothill Boulevard near Buena  Vista Street, which was just outside the spray zone in the Monrovia area, said  Don Henry, spokesman for the Medfly eradication project. The area has been  added to the spray zone that is to be treated with malathion Jan. 11.  </P> <P> The discovery brings the spray zone area to nearly 300 square miles. The find  also broke a two-week period of relative calm in the Medfly battle, during  which few discoveries were made and agriculture officials began to predict that  the infestation would soon be under control.  </P></p>

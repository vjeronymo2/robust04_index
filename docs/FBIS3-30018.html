First, it should be recalled that the term `peaceful  evolution' came into existence in 1949 when it was first used by  the Americans. The strategy has come to be a trick of  imperialism aimed at eradicating socialism. Shrouded with a  complex history, it has gone through many stages and has  resorted to various essential tricks such as creating  counterrevolutionary public opinion and mass media in the  ideological domain, making inroads into people's cultural  thinking, containing our economic growth, and nurturing  reactionary forces they call democratic forces.    Peaceful evolution is nothing but a change in the format to  conceal the reactionary nature of imperialism. This has been  identified and summed up through the following:    -- This strategy is conducted to gradually gain influence,  defeat socialism, and stamp out the international revolutionary  movement by peaceful means instead of violence.    -- This war is being waged by soft means such as  diplomatic, cultural, ideological, and political activities.  Violence will only be used as a last resort.    -- The war under the banner of peaceful evolution  advocates using mainly direct forces, namely men and means of a  rival country, to undermine the rival's internal ranks with  outside support to cause a swift crumbing and disintegration.  This format has caused the people to be mistaken about a change  in the nature of imperialism.    -- Basing itself mainly on social relations and on  imperialist designs, the peaceful evolution strategy advocates  using wise and sophisticated tricks to foment a tremendous  self-destruction force from within a rival country in order to  lead it to a comprehensive deterioration, internal anarchy, and  finally a swift and quiet crumbing about which the imperialists  will pretend to be innocent and uninvolved.    -- The peaceful evolution strategy bears a global  character. It does not have any time and space limits. The tempo  and the process of this war develop very slowly. Although this  war does not give any feeling of fierceness, the results it  produces may be very great.    -- The peaceful evolution strategy advocates building and  using on-site political forces to set up its base and rally  force from within the socialist regime for use as an inside  force. In this strategy, the imperialists will play the role of  external strike force. When the situation permits, they will  resort to military force.    Dear comrades and friends: For Vietnam, imperialism and  other hostile forces are using the peaceful evolution strategy  against our country. With their clear-cut objects and  strategies, they attach importance to the ideological and  theoretical struggle aimed at eradicating Marxism-Leninism and  Ho Chi Minh thought. This is one of their key spearhead moves  aimed at infiltrating deep into and effecting a change within  the internal ranks and the superstructure of the party and the  socialist state; driving our national economy to stray off the  socialist orbit course and undergo privatization and  liberization in accordance with the market economy format of  capitalism; rallying reactionaries from various religions and  ethnic minority groups, taking advantage of superstition and  divinity to incite the people to demand freedom and human rights  in opposition to us.    In can be said that hostile forces have openly announced  their design to carry out their peaceful evolution strategy  against our country and our regime. Lately, the enemy has  stepped up activities in various fields to achieve this. The  intensity of this war is increasing while its scale has been  expanded in various areas -- political, ideological, economic,  cultural, artistic, press, religious, racial, scientific,  theoretical, and in terms of organizing personnel.    The enemy, with the use of many overt, semi-overt, and  covert  means, is trying to gradually legalize various activities and  organizations while seeking ways to establish contact with our  people and involve themselves further in sowing division among  and undermining our internal ranks from within. Simultaneously,  they are striving to rally local reactionary forces and linking  these with outside reactionaries. They are resorting to  political tricks while attempting to prepare armed rebellions  for subversive purposes.    It is reported that on the cultural and ideological front,  in  1993 the enemy and the reactionaries intensified their sabotage  on a larger scale. According to incomplete statistics, there  existed 17 more overseas reactionary organizations from among  the exiled Vietnamese and an additional three  Vietnamese-language radio stations, including Radio Free Asia,  and 15 newspapers or magazines. In 1993 alone, they cooperated  in launching four major propaganda campaigns against Vietnam in  addition to many rallies and demonstrations in a number of  countries. They brought to our country thousands of reactionary  documents, of which 37 are new. Their activities consist of  spreading slanderous charges and incendiary propaganda about  democratic liberties, human rights, ethnic, and religious  issues. They have distorted incidents in Thua Thien Hue, Ba  Ria-Vung Tau, and Son La to sow division among the people. They  have increased their efforts to split overseas Vietnamese,  establish contact with and draw our overseas cadres, students,  and workers, and called for the overthrow of the party and the  socialist regime.    The enemy's mode of operations is open, brazen,  sophisticated, and crafty. Its nature is increasingly dangerous.  They are taking advantage of our party's renovation and  open-door policy to carry out activities through cooperation,  aid, investment. They have been carrying out clandestine  activities under the guise of economic cooperation. They are  upbeat in asking for the opening of cultural, scientific, and  technological information centers and using various conferences  and seminars to invite our cadres overseas to sign contracts and  buy materials and technologies so as to propagate, influence,  establish contact with, and bribe them. Certain enemy  organizations also intend to restore old organizations to rally  forces to be used as a springboard for sabotage activities  launched from the outside.    Thus, while the revolution's central tasks of national  construction and development are being busily carried out, the  tasks of safeguarding the country, regime, and party have also  developed in a very urgent manner. A number of incidents  involving Vietnam that took place before Tet provided new proof  by which our entire party, people, and army can clearly realize  their situation and tasks and heighten their vigilance in the  struggle against the enemy's schemes and tricks.    In 1994 and ensuing years, we must be more profoundly aware  that the peaceful evolution strategy is an attempt by hostile  forces to eradicate party rule and overthrow the  socialist-oriented political regime in our country. This  strategy is closely related to the dangers pointed out at the  mid-term national party conference: The scourge of corruption  and other social evils and being left further behind other  countries in the region and the world economically; and the  danger of straying from the socialist path if we fail to  overcome irregularities in providing guidance on these issues.  This is why we have to link the fight against peaceful  evolution with efforts to overcome these dangers.    It can be said that there is a rather fierce ideological  battle taking place between us and hostile forces as a result of  the peaceful evolution war. For the time being, we should build  and firmly consolidate our socialist ideological battleground if  we want all of our party members and the masses to stand firm on  the socialist path, Marxisim-Leninism, and Ho Chi Minh Thought;  thoroughly understand the party's various viewpoints and its  renovation policy; firmly maintain political stability; revamp  the people's security network; strengthen universal national  defense; and build a steadfast people's army.    It should be affirmed that it is the duty of every cadre and  combatant and our people to smash peaceful evolution  ideologically. To triumph in this tough and complex struggle,  we must counter the enemy's attack with the results of our  renovation process, with our theoretical research and  development of Marxism-Leninism and Ho Chi Minh Thought, and  with our efforts to build a fine lifestyle and ethical quality  for ourselves as revolutionaries. We will strive to illuminate  the legitimacy, clarity, and straightforwardness of the path  toward socialism; our country's inevitable road as well as the  law of evolution of history chosen for our nation with clear  foresight by our party and Uncle Ho.    To counter the enemy's peaceful evolution schemes  ideologically, armed forces units must always stress and  satisfactorily maintain internal political security, fight  against all of the enemy's psychological warfare schemes and  tricks, intensify efforts to build clean and steadfast party  organizations, and build comprehensively steadfast units.  Greater attention must be paid to political and ideological  training in view of this new situation so as to improve the  political acumen of cadres and soldiers. We must equip them  with the correct methodology so they can clearly differentiate  nature from phenomena and right from wrong. Cadres and  combatants will then have a clear idea of our friends and foes  and of the complex socio-political issues now emerging at home  and abroad.    Various units must formulate plans and measures to provide  adequate, correct, and guided information on new developments in  those fundamental issues related to the actual socio-political  situation at home and abroad that are having an impact on their  feelings and emotions, so they can cope with these things  correctly. On this basis, they must struggle against the  enemy's psychological warfare and efforts to sabotage us  psychologically. Various units must also step up the movement to  build a new cultural environment; they must struggle against  unhealthy lifestyles, preserve our fine customs and traditions,  and preserve and develop the character of Uncle Ho's troops in  view of the new situation and tasks.    Other aspects of the fight against peaceful evolution are  not  without difficulties. They require us to develop immediate and  long-term measures. These consist of: Satisfactorily  motivating various strata of the masses -- especially clergy,  intellectuals, writers, artists, industrialists, and businessmen  -- to keep the enemy from using our means of transportation,  post offices, printing houses, and the like for trouble-making  and sabotage; consolidating mass organizations; building  backbone forces for the political struggle; and paying attention  to the tasks of protecting the party, organizations, and party  cadres and members. Meanwhile, efforts must be made to detect  and eradicate reactionary organizations promptly to maintain  political stability, public order, and safety.    Dear comrades and friends, it is necessary to understand  correctly the nature and fundamental features of the  imperialists and the other hostile forces as well as their  attempts to carry out their peaceful evolution strategy at the  current complex juncture. If we heighten our vigilance and  remain dynamic, sensitive, and able to counter the enemy  unreservedly and promptly with our blows, the enemy will not be  able to hold sway and attain the desired results. Meanwhile, we  should not disregard the enemy's strategy. In 1994 and ensuring  years, the fight against peaceful evolution is likely to become  tougher and fiercer. This requires our entire party, people,  and army to be more dynamic and determined to foil the enemy's  malicious strategy and firmly preserve the ideal and the path we  have chosen.</p>

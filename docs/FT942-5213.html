			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: VSO not an elite scheme Sir, David Goodhart's article 'Army of volunteers may be called up' (June 2) refers to VSO (Voluntary Service Overseas) as an 'elite scheme . . . for middle class young people'. If that description was ever accurate, it has certainly been out of date for some years now. VSO started out as a scheme for young people, but these days only accepts skilled people aged above 20 - and up to the age of 70; the average age of a volunteer is now 34, and nearly 10 per cent of the people now overseas are above 50. Nor, I think, could it be described simply as 'middle class', since those 1,750 volunteers include bricklayers, carpenters, technical instructors, water engineers, and many others who do not necessarily fall into that socio-economic bracket. Equally importantly, volunteers are not expected to fund themselves; they receive an allowance equivalent to a local level wage. VSO is in the business of supplying skills which have been requested by governments and community organisations in 57 countries, in the pursuit of a more equitable world. New volunteer schemes would offer complementary rather than supplementary, opportunities for people in Britain. Ken Caldwell, deputy director, VSO, 317 Putney Bridge Road, London SW15 2PN</p>

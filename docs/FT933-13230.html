			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / Government Bonds: French sector steady despite worries over ERM DOOM-LADEN predictions about the end of the European exchange rate mechanism refused to die down yesterday but the French government bond market, which is close to the centre of those predictions, was surprisingly steady. The Notionnel 10-year bond future for September opened at 120.32, edged some 20 centimes higher in the morning and then drifted back to close unchanged. The French franc continued under pressure against the D-Mark but the government bond market shrugged off currency tensions. Traders said that inflationary pressures were so low that the debt market would remain attractive for some time. They said that international investors concerned about the currency would hedge against further falls by buying D-Marks rather than selling French bonds. The brief rise in mid-morning came after the German Bundesbank announced a surprise two-day reverse repo at 7.15 per cent, down from the current repo rate of 7.28 per cent. Against the usual trend, the German central bank bought D-Marks in order to drain money from the system following the heavy franc/D-Mark speculation of recent days and sold currency, probably dollars. GERMAN bunds traded slightly easier yesterday with some switching into domestic public authority bonds. The Liffe bund futures contract for September fell by 0.03 to 96.23. RECENT attacks on the Danish krone left their mark on Danish government bonds, which fell at the 10 and five-year level. The yield on 8 per cent government stock dated 2003 rose to 7.16 per cent from 7.03 per cent while the yield on the 8 per cent bond due 1998 rose to 7.18 per cent from 6.8 per cent. Mr Jonathan Davis of UBS said: 'It is a fairly hefty increase but the fundamentals are good and the only thing holding back the performance is the concern of currency hedging.' IN THE UK, investors shunted along the yield curve to avoid concerns hanging over the short end and middle reaches. Short-dated prices fell as traders responded to a raft of stories in the weekend press highlighting the signs of economic recovery and the consequent fading chance of a cut in base rates. Meanwhile, the market shunned five to eight-year maturities ahead of the announcement of the precise details (due today) of the next big gilts auction set for July 28. The Bank of England said on Friday that it will auction an unspecified amount of stock maturing between 1998 and 2001. Dealers were loth to be left with gilts maturing between those dates on their hands ahead of a supply boost, which is forecast to be some Pounds 3.25bn. JAPANESE government bonds traded in London consolidated following a strong performance in Tokyo dealing. The prospect of near-term political uncertainty following Sunday's election was overshadowed by hopes of a cut in the 2 1/4 per cent official discount rate. The yield on the JGB No 145 fell from 4.24 to 4.23 per cent in Tokyo but picked up slightly in London. US TREASURY prices were narrowly mixed in the absence of market-moving news. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond recovered from its morning losses to edge  1/32 higher to 107 19/32 , yielding 6.538 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was off  1/32 , to yield 3.972 per cent. Treasuries started to slide after oil prices rose on news that Opec has scheduled a meeting for later this month. The news triggered futures-led selling in the bond market. Overall, market sentiment remains cautious ahead of today's release of June housing starts and the beginning of Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan's Humphrey-Hawkins testimony before the House Banking Committee. The Federal Reserve entered the open market to arrange three-day system repurchase agreements when Fed Funds were trading at 3 3/16 per cent, slightly above the perceived target for the rate of 3 per cent. The move, which adds reserves to the banking system, was widely expected. Fed funds closed at 3 1/8 per cent.</p>

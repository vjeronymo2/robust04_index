			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / New consortium sets its sights on Channel 5 An international consortium, believed to include three big UK corporations with no significant broadcasting interests, is to bid for the new Channel 5 television licence. The group is led by CanWest Global Communications, a Canadian broadcasting group with interests in New Zealand, Australia and Chile. It declined to name its partners for the Channel 5 bid. At the same time Virgin Communications, part of Mr Richard Branson's Virgin Group, has appointed Mr Jeremy Fox, president of Channel 9 Australia, to develop Virgin's broadcast interests, including a possible bid for Channel 5. Mr Fox will stay as president of Channel 9, the international arm of Mr Kerry Packer's television interests. He said: 'The plan is to put the Virgin style on television to appeal to an audience that knows the Virgin brand.' The growing interest in Channel 5 comes as the Independent Television Commission meets today to decide whether to advertise a licence for the channel. All the signs are that it will approved the new channel, and could advertise the franchise by early November. The channel would require the retuning of existing video recorders and new aerials in some areas but is seen as one of the last broadcasting opportunities with existing technology in a big European market. Others who have expressed interest include NBC, the US network broadcaster, Yorkshire-Tyne Tees, the ITV company, and a consortium of Time Warner, Pearson - which owns the Financial Times - and MAI, the company that controls Meridian Broadcasting. Mr Stephen Castell, a communications consultant, intends to bid to use the channel capacity for digital television services. The big issue is the range the channel will have. The original frequency plan envisaged that Channel 5 could reach about 75 per cent of the population. The government, heavily influenced by Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, decided to set some of the frequencies aside for the future development of digital terrestrial television. As a result little more than 53 per cent of the country would be sure of receiving Channel 5, although the ITC is already seeking international permission to use new frequencies. A final reach of more than 60 per cent is likely and there is a theoretical possibility that 70 per cent could eventually receive the new channel. The CanWest bid for the channel is being co-ordinated by Media Ventures International, which bid successfully for the UK's third national commercial radio licence with UK Talk Radio. CanWest is an investor in the station. Media Ventures also bid successfully with Associated Newspapers for the ITV teletext licence.</p>

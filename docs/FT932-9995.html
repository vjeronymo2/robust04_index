			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / International Company News: Wall Street broker confirms job losses SMITH Barney Shearson, the US brokerage house created earlier this year, confirmed yesterday that it would shed between 1,200 and 1,500 jobs this year, mostly from the company's back office operations. The lay-offs are part of a restructuring of the new company, created when Primerica, the diversified financial services group which owned Smith Barney Harris Upham, the Wall Street firm, bought American Express's Shearson brokerage unit for about Dollars 1bn. The merger made the new entity the second largest securities brokerage house in the US, behind Merrill Lynch, long-time industry leader. Smith Barney Shearson, which employs 26,500, said that some staff had been notified of planned redundancies, and that the gradual process of lay-offs would probably be completed by the end of this year. The job cuts will come in the company's back office processing and clearing operations, as well as in the administration, personnel and human resources departments. The roughly 11,000 stockbrokers who work for Smith Barney Shearson will not be affected by the workforce reductions. In some areas, such as capital markets, research and corporate finance, the firm is said to be hiring staff.</p>

			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Observer: Name on the line Psst . . .fancy owning the Greenwich meridian? A three-year lease on the world's most famous line is being offered by the Old Royal Observatory in London's Greenwich Park, at Pounds 150,000 per annum. Besides being a snip compared with the Jubilee line extension, the meridian isn't entirely imaginary. At least a few yards thereof are marked on the ground for tourists to straddle and be photographed with one foot in the western hemisphere and the other in the eastern. The hope is that some company might like to get its name in the picture by becoming the line's official sponsor, so helping to re-develop Greenwich's 'museum of time'. The plan is to have nine galleries housing astronomical instruments and the like, some dating back beyond the observatory's foundation by Charles II in 1675, according to project chief Stephen Deuchar. 'The work will cost Pounds 600,000. So we thought, since Accurist is now sponsoring British Telecom's speaking clock, why not the meridian?' Well, perhaps so, Observer said. But whatever next - put Greenwich Mean Time itself on the market? 'How much a second d'you think we could get for it?', answered Deuchar.</p>

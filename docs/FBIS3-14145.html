Greetings to you on the Pakistan Day. I feel proud to address  this joint parade of the armed forces, which is the most  magnificent ceremony of Pakistan Day. On this auspicious day of  Pakistan Day, the Muslims of the subcontinent pledged that they  would create a separate independent homeland for the defense of  their religion, history, traditions, and their own national  identity. This commitment of ours has had the support of  Almighty God. That is why we were fortunate to have a  sagacious, sincere, and resolute leader like Qaide Azam Mohammad  Ali Jinnah, under whose unprecedented leadership we reached our  destination. But let me remind you that this boon of freedom  was achieved through the great sacrifices of hundreds of  thousands of Muslims. On this day, we bow our heads to God in  thanksgiving while paying tributes to the Qaide Azam Mohammad  Ali Jinnah, saluting our martyrs, and making a pledge that we  will defend this trust and the sacred motherland of Pakistan.  We will work relentlessly and not hesitate to make any  sacrifice for the country's strength. The armed forces are  proud that the sacred responsibility of defending the country  lies with them. Our soldiers, navy men, and airmen are experts  in the military arts and are the embodiments of sacrifice and  bravery. Today's glorious parade reflects their professional  standard. The resolute faces of the officers and soldiers  taking part in the parade manifest their morale, enthusiasm, and  spirit. These are those holy warriors who, every second, are  ready to face any danger facing the country and who are ever  willing to directly confront the enemy's designs. The nation has  full confidence in their military capability and bravery.  Whether in times of war or peace, they are always ready to  respond to the call of duty. They have manifested dutifulness,  performance, devotion, and sacrifice in the face of natural  calamities and all kinds of emergencies. Through their bravery,  determination, enthusiasm, and self- sacrifice, they have  conquered all adversities. We are sure that they will also  overcome any test in the future and will maintain their glorious  traditions.    Sometime back, the armed forces were given the duty of  assisting in holding the general elections in a peaceful  atmosphere and in an impartial and orderly manner. The task was  of national importance, which they performed with such  excellence that all political parties and national and  international observers commended them.    For the last one and half years, our Army has been assisting  the provincial government to restore law and order and to uproot  crime in Sindh. As a result of the industrious action in this  connection, the law and order situation has improved and it is  now hoped that in the future a common citizen will be able to  live in a peaceful atmosphere.    Our brave officers and soldiers are serving valiantly in  the icy Siachen region -- the highest battleground of the world  -- and are risking their lives to discharge their duty to defend  the country. Their morale, determination and steadfastness in  this extremely inhospitable region are proof of their role as  holy warriors and reflect our glorious military traditions.    Similarly, along the hundreds of miles of the line of  control  in Kashmir, our holy warriors -- indifferent to the serious  weather conditions and difficulties of the mountainous region --  are devoted to foiling the enemy's designs and discharging their  defensive duties in the forward areas. The effective defense of  the motherland is on top of the present government's priorities.  Despite the financial constraints faced by the country and the  burden of the socioeconomic problems, the Pakistan Government  attaches great importance to defense requirements because the  country's stability and an atmosphere conducive to socioeconomic  progress largely depend on an effective defense. It is our  commitment that regardless of all difficulties and all types of  internal and external pressures, we will continue our efforts to  make our defense stronger and stronger. An estimate of the  danger facing our country can be made by viewing the accelerated  military expenditures and preparations being carried out in our  neighboring country. In view of these dangers, we have no  alternative but to pay full attention to our defense. The  security of the country and a strong defense are our top foreign  policy objectives. We are using our diplomatic and  international connections for this purpose and promoting  cooperation with friendly countries in the economic as well as  in the defense field to the maximum possible extent.    We want to maintain cordial relations with the entire world  in general and with the Muslim and neighboring states in  particular on the basis of equality and national dignity. To us,  lasting peace is based on faith in coexistence, respect for each  country's territorial integrity and sovereignty, refraining from  interfering in others' internal affairs and not indulging in  fostering designs to establish hegemony in any region,  especially regarding small neighboring countries. We ourselves  do not have any aggressive designs against any country, nor do  we want to occupy anyone's territory, hurt its just national  interests, or establish dominance over states in our region.  We want to see this principle practiced in the foreign policy  of our neighboring countries because in any region relations  based on peace and friendship and tension-free ties depend on  implementing these principles. Thank God, we enjoy cordial  relations with all countries of the world. We enjoy deep  fraternal ties with all Muslim countries in our region. We  enjoy exemplary relations with the people's Republic of China,  and we are proud of these ties. We also enjoy deep and fruitful  relations with the South Asian states.    We want to establish similar relations with our close  eastern  neighbor, but the Kashmir issue is a fundamental obstacle in the  path of normal relations. The only solution to this issue is  for the Kashmiri people to exercise the right of  self-determination given to them in accordance with the 1947  Indian partition plan, the UN resolutions, and international  law. Unfortunately, our neighbor is yet not aware of this  reality. However, the Kashmiri people's unprecedented uprising  and their spirit of freedom, courage, determination, and  sacrifice is rudely awakening people's consciences. That is why  the day is not far off when, like Muslims of other parts of the  subcontinent, Kashmiri people will also achieve their  inalienable right of self-determination. The Kashmiri uprising  has entered a decisive stage. The Pakistani Government and  people are behind the oppressed Kashmiri people and will  continue to extend full political, diplomatic and moral support  to them.    Pakistan is not only our motherland, but also a strong  fortress of Islam, by the grace of God. In this way, certain  responsibilities fall on our shoulders. We are grateful to God  that He has granted us the will and the divine guidance under  which we are fulfilling our responsibilities toward the Islamic  community according to our capability.    We enjoy deep Islamic fraternal relations with Afghanistan.  We have supported our Afghan brethren to the best of our  ability in their historic struggle against foreign aggression.  Now, we pray to God for an early establishment of peace and  tranquillity in Afghanistan so that our brotherly country can  march toward peace and reconciliation and progress and  prosperity.    An Islamic country which is facing foreign aggression  because  of the apathy of the international community and where human  rights, international law, the UN resolutions, and the  recognized principles of justice are being mercilessly violated  is Bosnia. As a member of the United Nations and in view of our  Islamic ties, we are aggrieved at the brutalities being  committed against the people of Bosnia and are raising our voice  against them at all international forums. The Bosnian problem  is a glaring example of the international community's double  standard. Like Somalia, where our troops are offering great  sacrifices to maintain law and order and to ensure the continued  supply of international aid to its people under the leadership  of the United Nations, we are ready to assist the United Nations  in protecting the besieged and unarmed people of Bosnia and  establishing peace there. Pakistan is supporting and providing  practical assistance to the UN efforts to establish peace in  different regions of the world. The record of services rendered  by the Pakistani forces in this regard is excellent. Only  recently, our troops returned home after performing their duties  regarding the conducting of elections and the restoration of  democracy in Cambodia after the establishment of peace in that  country. The manner in which their superior performance has  been admired at international level is a matter of great pride  for us. I congratulate our brave armed forces for this. A  strong defense is deeply related to law and order, economic  progress, and social justice. We cannot strengthen our defense  without strengthening our economy and scientific, technical, and  industrial development. Under the conditions of a weak economy  and educational backwardness, we can neither achieve  self-sufficiency in the field of arms manufacturing nor provide  the required resources to the defense sector. Therefore, your  government is making concrete, comprehensive, and coordinated  efforts to accelerate the pace of the country's economic  development, to generate maximum opportunities for employment,  and to provide education and health care facilities to the  majority of the population. Several task forces have been set  up for this purpose. In accordance with the recommendations of  these task forces, legislations are being enacted and a new  administrative structure is being set up; in addition, the  implementation of the economic development program in all  spheres of life is going on at full swing. Under the new Social  Contract program of the elected popular government, the people  are being provided with social justice and civic amenities,  their due shares in economic and educational development, and  human rights. This will not only create a new awakening among  our people, but will also create a new spirit and enthusiasm,  besides increasing their productivity and the country's gross  production; and the nation will march forward on the path of  prosperity. In this manner, the (?government) will play an  important role in ensuring the progress of our hard-working,  sincere, and patriotic people and in strengthening the defense  of the motherland and the security of the nation.    Today's grand parade, in which not only our valiant forces  but also the four provinces are participating with the  variegated colors of their respective cultures and economies, is  a symbol of our nation's bright and promising future. I  congratulate the organizers of this parade and compliment the  officers, leaders of the marching contingents, and soldiers.  May God help and protect you! Long live the armed forces of  Pakistan! Long Live Pakistan!</p>

			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie index closes at six-month high THE FIRST of an expected flurry of post-general election takeover bids in the London market emerged yesterday and helped fuel another determined advance by UK equities. The FT-SE 100 share index rose 9.5 to 2,600.5, its highest closing level since October 18 last year and a rise of 164.1 since the Tory election victory last Friday. Hongkong and Shanghai Banking's agreed offer for Midland Bank, worth in excess of Pounds 3bn, came as no great surprise to banking specialists although there was disappointment at the terms. Within two hours or so of the announcement it emerged that a big block of Midland shares were being offered around the market. Although there was no official confirmation it was thought that Hoare Govett had been unsuccessful in attempting to place 60m of the Kuwait Investment Office's 78m stake in Midland. The market's disappointment at the terms was reflected in the decline in Midland's share price. The market opened around five points lower, concerned that any unexpected bad news in the large batch of company reports expected this week could spark off a prolonged bout of profit-taking in leading stocks. But with no real horrors emerging from yesterday's results and the Hongkong bid being confirmed the market turned upwards and reached a day's high of 2,603.5, or 12.5 firmer, in mid-morning. Thereafter the Footsie traded in a relatively narrow range, with dealers professing slight disappointment at London's reaction to encouraging data on the UK economy, released around midday, and a firm opening by Wall Street. They also mentioned the rally by Tokyo overnight. The US market was moving ahead strongly after London closed. A 1.1 per cent rise in UK industrial production was well ahead of market expectations, as was the similar rise in manufacturing output, according to market observers. Gilts, under modest pressure during the early part of the day, rallied to close modestly higher on balance, helped by another steadfast showing by sterling. Turnover in equities remained brisk but continued to diminish. Yesterday saw 601.8m shares change hands, compared with Monday's 629.3m and last Friday's 1.345bn. Stock Exchange figures showed that the value of customer business on Monday totalled Pounds 1.22bn, or around half that of last Friday. Building shares remained in the spotlight with full-year results from RMC coming out ahead of most expectations. The dividend was particularly well received and the shares delivered one the Footsie's best individual performances. Taylor Woodrow also came in for strong support despite the lapse into losses for the year. Dealers were bracing themselves for bad news on the dividend front from Tarmac this morning. A senior marketmaker described the market's performance as encouraging and said it had been a session of consolidation. 'Wall Street looks okay, we've closed above 2,500 and there are hints of plenty of bids and rights issues in the pipeline,' he said.</p>

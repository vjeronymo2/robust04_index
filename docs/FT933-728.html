			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Kuwaiti paper warns of pull-out ONE of Kuwait's leading independent newspapers warned yesterday that the emirate might be unwilling to invest in the UK if it lost its valuable sovereign immunity from taxation. In an editorial, the al-Qabas newspaper reacted strongly to what it called 'the astonishing . . . threats and intimidation about rescinding tax exemption'. Last week the FT disclosed that Kuwait may have abused the immunity by receiving more than Pounds 600m of tax refunds on a Dollars 1.7bn investment in British Petroleum. At the weekend Lord Shawcross, one of Kuwait's most distinguished and long-standing UK advisers, warned of the potential immunity loss in a letter to a senior member of the emirate's ruling Al-Sabah family. Yesterday, however, Whitehall officials reacted cautiously to any threat of investment withdrawal from the UK, pointing out that al-Qabas does not necessarily reflect Kuwaiti government thinking. Although the Kuwaiti state sold off some of its UK assets to pay for the Gulf War, the Kuwaitis still have extensive landholding and other investments in Britain. The Foreign Office and the Department and Trade and Industry said yesterday they had received no approach from the Kuwaiti government expressing concern on the tax issue.</p>

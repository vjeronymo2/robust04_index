			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report from the "NHK News" program] </F>   [Text] North Korea [DPRK] has issued a statement on its  decision to refuse the UN Security Council [UNSC] request that  it accept inspection of its nuclear facilities by the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Commenting on the  statement, the Japanese Government said it was very regrettable  that the country failed to fully understand the international  community's real intention.    The government expressed particularly grave concern that the  North Korean statement, in which the country said it had been  forced to resume its suspended nuclear development, may become a  decisive factor in leaving the country isolated in the  international community.    On the other hand, the government intends to make additional  efforts to influence North Korea to accept inspections of its  nuclear facilities, this time in cooperation with China, which  still has influence in North Korea.    Meanwhile, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa held talks today  with South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, who is  currently visiting Japan. In the talks they shared the view  that China's cooperation is necessary to solving the issue of  nuclear inspections of North Korea.    Foreign Minister Han said the significance of the UNSC's  presidential statement adopted at the end of March was that it  held China to a sense of obligation to make progress on the  issue. He said there was an impression that China was trying to  play a more positive role than before.    In response, Prime Minister Hosokawa said it is necessary  for  the countries concerned -- namely Japan, the United States, and  South Korea as well as China -- to cooperate in influencing  North Korea to solve the issue. They confirmed the intention to  continue to urge North Korea to accept the inspections by the  end of this month [April].</p>

			<p><P> November 17, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> MINNESOTA SEEKS COLLEGE SERIES  </P> <P> A delegation from Minnesota is trying to persuade the NCAA to move the 1993  College World Series from Omaha, the event's home the last 42 years, to the  Metrodome.  </P> <P> A seven-man delegation representing the University of Minnesota, the Metrodome  and the Minnesota Twins made the presentation earlier this week in Kansas City,  Mo.  </P> <P> "No bid was submitted, nor was one requested. It was just a discussion to see  what's available and a good opportunity to visit," said Dennis Poppe, NCAA  director of championships.  </P> <P> University of Minnesota men's Athletic Director Rick Bay, who led the  delegation, said he is sensitive to the College World Series' close ties to  Omaha, where 186,000 people attended the event last June. "It's a great  environment, almost a 'Field of Dreams' atmosphere," Bay said. "We aren't  trying to convince the NCAA to move it out of Omaha, but if it is moved, it  only makes sense to go to a higher level."  </P> <P> The College World Series is committed to Omaha until 1992.  </P></p>

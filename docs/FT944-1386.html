			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Norwegians withdraw from gas pipe project Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, and Norsk Hydro, Norway's largest publicly quoted company, have abruptly withdrawn from the proposed 440m pipeline project to link the UK with the European natural gas grid. The new pipeline, know as the interconnector, will allow large-scale gas exports from the UK by the end of the decade. The interconnector will be owned by British Gas, with 40 per cent, British Petroleum, Elf Aquitaine, Gazprom of Russia and Conoco, each with 10 per cent, and UK utility National Power, Ruhrgas of Germany, Distrgaz of Belgium and Amerada Hess, each with 5 per cent. Statoil and Norsk Hydro said they had made their participation in the pipeline conditional on achieving a solution to a dispute between Norway and Britain over a new Frigg gas pipeline treaty. 'However, the majority of the other companies involved in the scheme were unwilling to accept this reservation. The dispute over the Frigg line consequently has to find a political solution,' Statoil said. The British government refuses to ratify the deal, valued at more than NKr20bn (Pounds 1.87bn) and agreed in 1991 for Norway to supply National Power with 30.8bn cubic metres of gas over 14 years through the Frigg pipeline. Norway says the British government made Norwegian companies' participation in the interconnector conditional on clearing the way for new Norwegian gas exports to the UK through the Frigg gas pipeline. 'We will wait for the British government to clarify its position on the Frigg pipeline before deciding our next move on the treaty issue,' said Mr Tore Sandvold, director-general at Norway's industry and energy ministry. Norway and Britain have for several years been in dispute over the terms governing transport of new Norwegian gas deliveries to the UK through the Frigg pipeline. Meanwhile, a planning application for the interconnector will be submitted early next year, in time for construction to begin in the spring of 1996. the pipeline is likely to be completed in the autumn of 1988. It will carry 20bn cubic metres of gas annually.</p>

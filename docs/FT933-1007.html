			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Dividends and tax credits MY WIFE'S income, which is well up into the basic rate band, stems predominantly from UK dividends with their associated tax credit. From her income she makes covenanted payments to charities well above the small interest element in her income which has borne tax at the basic rate. Your recent article stated that basic rate taxpayers have no further liability on dividend income 'because the legislation provides that, within the basic rate band, the rate of tax applying to dividends is only 20 per cent, not 25 per cent.' Does this also mean that dividend income in these circumstances covers the requirement that covenanted charitable payments have to be paid from tax income? Or will the Revenue be entitled to recover the difference of 5 per cent through my wife's assessment? If so, it seems to me that there are implications, not publicised to my knowledge, for a great many taxpayers. Unfortunately, there will be a clawback of 5 per cent, to the extent that the gross amount of the covenanted charitable annuities exceeds the gross amount of your wife's non-dividend income. This result is achieved by section 207A(1) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 in conjunction with section 3(a). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

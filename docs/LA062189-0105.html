DeLong claimed that Pittenger had caused him  to spin out two laps earlier.  </P> <P> "Oh, I took him out," DeLong said. "I just wanted to give him back what he gave  me. I figured, if I can't finish the race, then neither is he."  </P> <P> As both cars slammed into the wall, DeLong's vaulted over Pittenger's and  landed atop the wall on its left side. Spectators in the grandstands scurried  from the scene as Pittenger, who walked away unhurt, leaped from his burning  vehicle.  </P> <P> DeLong suffered a broken left foot and minor burns. NASCAR officials are  reviewing the incident.  </P></p>

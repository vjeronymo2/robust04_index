			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Executive Cars (4): Even prestige marques feel the pinch - Specialist Manufacturers THE PAST year has exposed with increasingly severe difficulties facing the smaller, specialist car makers. In the UK, where new car sales are suffering from one of their steepest post-war recessions, the result has been receivership for some of the smallest names. These have included sports car makers Reliant and Evante; although, such is the optimism which seems to infect those who come into contact with specialist car-making, that each has subsequently found a buyer and is sputtering back to life. Even the most prestigious marques, however, are taking a severe battering, with Porsche and Rolls-Royce among the most notable victims. At the beginning of this month, the Stuttgart manufacturer whose luxury sports cars came to symbolise yuppy aspiration and entrepreneurial achievement in the 1980s, announced that it was making 850 of its workforce redundant. This was on top of 950 announced a few months earlier, bringing the workforce down to around 7,000. The reason lies in slumping sales figures - to near-catastrophic levels in the US, which was once Porsche's largest single market. In its current financial year ending next month, Porsche expects to have delivered 22,000 cars worldwide. That may not sound too severe a drop from the 26,000 of 1990-91, but it compares with sales of more than 50,000 in the mid-1980s. The US, where Porsche was finding 30,000 buyers a year in the mid-1980s, last year absorbed fewer than 5,000. The job-cuts and other economies should lead to DM100m (Pounds 34.3m) in operating-cost savings next year, and Porsche should still just make a profit in the current year, according to its chairman, Mr Arno Bohn. But the first-half profit was a wafer-thin DM2m and, measured by sales, Porsche is getting perilously close to the danger level in terms of viability. Break-even lies only 1,000 units below last year's delivery level. What has gone wrong? Mr Bohn's explanation is that, in the US in particular, 'the desire to buy luxury goods is not there' and that 'there are problems with the social acceptability of cars costing DM100,000 or more.' The explanation is valid as far as it goes. Honda, for example, has seen US sales of its Dollars 63,000 NSX mid-engined 'supercar' fall by 38 per cent so far this year, and other high-performance sports car sales have also weakened. Underlying Porsche's problems, however, is competition, intensifying at extraordinary speed, from Japanese rivals for which, only a few years ago, previous Porsche managers regarded with barely-disguised contempt. Mazda, Mitsubishi, Nissan and Honda all have significant rivals to Porsche's models, are introducing new ones at a daunting rate and, backed by their volume car businesses, possess the advantage of being able to charge mostly cheaper prices. In contrast, and despite the 944's facelift, an aura of ageing familiarity hangs over all three of Porsche's current model range. US buyers have so far have shown relatively muted enthusiasm for Porsche's latest offering, a heavily-revised 944 model, which Porsche regards to be considers sufficiently 'different' from the 944 to be redesignated the 968, and which went on sale in the US at the end of last year for Dollars 40,000. The company needs a heavy investment programme in new product and, its critics say, has been too slow and too cautious in coming up with one. Although it still has substantial cash assets, its size leaves it at a financial disadvantage relative to its larger competitors in terms of long-term investment funding. In the opening months of this year, there were faint signs that the worst of Porsche's problems in the US might be coming to an end. Sales to the end of April were down 'only' another 5 per cent, at 1,482, according to Automotive News statistics. And the company has been jolted into action on the product front. Plans for a new, up-market four-seater have been shelved. By 1996, a new sports car pitched squarely at Japanese rivals such as the Mazda RX-7 should be on the road. Strains have been felt throughout the group, not least in management. Mr Bohn himself earlier this year threatened to resign when Porsche's supervisory board initially failed to approve renewal of his contract after it expires at the end of this year - he has since had it renewed for three years. And the long-serving chief executives of Porsche's subsidiaries in both the US and the UK have decided to leave the company in the past year. Inevitably, speculation has arisen about whether Porsche can retain its independence. Despite offers from Mercedes-Benz and others, Mr Bohn insists that the Porsche and Piech families-controlled company remains not for sale. At the Crewe headquarters of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, the strain has been no less intense. The chairman and chief executive, Mr Peter Ward, and his management team at the UK's most prestigious car company have spent much of the past six months uncertain as to whether Rolls-Royce will remain part of Vickers, the UK engineering group which has owned it for more than a decade, or whether the company will, in the end, be sold. Certainly, Vickers has tried hard to sell it - to the consternation of die-hard Anglophiles, who feel that Rolls is quintessentially English and that its sale to a probably foreign buyer should not be contemplated. To their relief, Vickers has yet to receive an offer which it regards as high enough, despite discussions with a number of companies including BMW. The problems at Rolls are similar in type, but not scale or detail, to those at Porsche: a company whose physical size is a lot smaller than its reputation (in a good year, Rolls builds around 3,000 cars), and recession in all its major markets. So in the space of three years Rolls has gone from being the profits flagship of the Vickers groups to a significant loss-maker. Sales in 1991 plunged 48.3 per cent to 1,723 - the lowest level since 1968 - from the record 3,333 achieved in 1990, dragging Rolls down to a Pounds 30m trading loss last year. Sales this year are expected to be at around the same level, although losses should be cut to Pounds 15m or less as a result of extensive job cuts and other savings. Again, though, the worst may just be over. Rolls is cautiously predicting that, by the end of the year, it may be trading at breakeven. For some of the best-known specialists, at least, survival in a harsh climate is no longer an issue - but only because they have become acclimatised to life under the ownership of volume producers. Thus, while Jaguar is still struggling to reverse sales which, worldwide, fell sharply last year and plunged production from nearly 42,000 in 1991 to fewer than 23,000 last year, it is developing major new product plans, including a smaller luxury saloon, under the wing of its owner, Ford. Aston Martin is able to plan a new 'cheaper' sports car - likely still to cost close to Pounds 100,000, however - for 1994, thanks to the financial underpinning of 75 per cent ownership by Ford. The car is to be built at a rate of 625 a year, and with its own unique Aston Martin engine; but not at Aston Martin's traditional 'home' at Newport Pagnell, Buckinghamshire. Instead, the company is creating a new subsidiary, Aston Martin Oxford, to oversee the car's birth. It will be developed at Kidlington, Oxford, in premises owned by JaguarSport, a 50-50 joint venture company between Jaguar and Mr Tom Walkinshaw's TWR Group, which also operates Jaguar's racing activities. The NPX will actually be built at JaguarSport's manufacturing plant at Bloxham, Oxfordshire, where a new Jaguar 'supercar', the Pounds 350,000 XJ220, has just entered production. JaguarSport is making only 350 XJ220s, and the premises are expected to be devoted entirely to Aston Martin after the last XJ220 comes off the line in two years' time. Meanwhile, Group Lotus, the UK specialist sports car-maker has cut its workforce by 40 per cent. This followed poor sales of its Elan sports car, output of which was down 58 per cent in this year's first quarter, to 338, after having reached 2,240 for all of 1991. Nevertheless, it can be fairly sure of a long-term future under the ownership of General Motors. The swallowing up of the industry's 'minnows', however, is not an irresistible trend. TVR, at Blackpool on the UK's north-west coast, has survived since 1954 by making hairy-chested tubular steel and fibreglass sports cars, which require relatively low tooling costs and give a considerable degree of design flexibility. TVR has soldiered on, never making more than a few hundred units a year, mainly because its cars' styling, design and sometimes eccentric standards of finish have proved attractive to only a small coterie of enthusiasts. Its recent launch of a new model, the Griffith, caused a minor sensation, however. The car was compared favourably, at least in styling terms, with much more prestigious marques. Consequently, TVR is for the first time contemplating production of more than 1,000 cars a year. It has been left to AC Cars, however, to buck the takeover trend completely. In 1987, with all the volume manufacturers buying up minor nameplates as fast as they could go, Ford bought a 50.96 per cent stake in AC, a Surrey-based specialist sports car company, for Pounds 1.3m. Ford bought the stake mainly because of AC's production of the Cobra, a major image builder for Ford in the 1960s, when it sold the Cobra through its North American dealer network. Now Ford is selling its holding, for an undisclosed sum, back to Mr Brian Angliss, AC Cars' managing director, who also controls Autokraft, a private company which holds the minority stake in AC Cars. Both sides say the sale was amicable, and Ford will continue to help AC to produce a new, low-volume sports car while retaining the right to the Cobra name in North America. Behind the scenes, however, lies the old culture clash between corporate and individualist. Mr Angliss now intends to find a new partner to put the car into production at volumes of 500-600 a year. Resurrecting another old AC name, it is to be called the Ace. Whether Mr Angliss has played one, only time will tell.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["gb" report: "Bundesbank Lowers Money Market Rate"] </F>   [Text] Frankfurt/Main, 20 Apr -- On Wednesday [20 April]  the German Bundesbank allocated to the business banks new  financial means at an interest rate of 5.58 percent within the  framework of its weekly money market business. Last week this  interest rate had been 5.7 percent and the week before 5.73  percent. The slightly faster decline of the so-called "third  prime rate" was no surprise to most participants in the market,  after the Bundesbank had reduced the two traditional interest  rates, the discount rate and the Lombard rate, last Thursday [14  April]. A few hours after the allocation by the Bundesbank, the  Belgian National Bank announced a reduction of its money market  rate from 5.8 to 5.7 percent.</p>

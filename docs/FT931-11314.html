			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Second rescue for Faroe Islands bank THE Danish government has put up DKr350m (Pounds 36.3m) to rescue the largest bank on the Faroe Islands, Sjovinnubanken (Fisheries Bank), from collapse, the second time the Danes have had to help within a few months, writes Hilary Barnes in Copenhagen. The North Atlantic island group, population 47,000, is a part of the Kingdom of Denmark but enjoys extensive home rule. The islands have been plunged into crisis by a combination of high government spending programmes and a decline in income from fisheries, which account for 97 per cent of export earnings. The Danish government propped up the privately-owned Sjovinnubanken with DKr500m last autumn, on condition that the islands' government sought the advice of experts from the International Monetary Fund on a policy to restore the economy. This week's support for the bank was made conditional on a reduction in the fisheries fleet, tax changes, and a halt to public investment programmes. The islands' crisis follows large expansion of the fisheries fleet and filleting factories in the 1980s, encouraged by direct and indirect government subsidies, and an ambitious investment programme. The investments were financed by borrowing heavily abroad, with the result that the net foreign debt at the end of 1991, at DKr8.1bn, was about DKr175,000 per inhabitant.</p>

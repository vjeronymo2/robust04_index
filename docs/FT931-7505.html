			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Letter: Business Expansion Scheme will bail out building societies Sir, I refer to John Gapper's article 'Back from the brink of despair' (February 17). It is not the very large drop in interest rates which is going to bail out the building societies movement. The release of repossessed properties from the non-performing loan book into Business Expansion Schemes will be the significant factor. The government is allowing higher-rate taxpayers 40 per cent relief to put money into Business Expansion Schemes which will defer for five years the impact of the iceberg while only tying up the investors' capital for six months. Notwithstanding lower interest rates and Business Expansion Schemes, the building society movement still has to address the fact that transactions have fallen by more than 50 per cent and the present high numbers of staff cannot be supported indefinitely unless the number of transactions is increased significantly towards levels previously attained.

			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Preview of the Results Season: When rights may no longer be right WHO IS going to finance an upturn in corporate activity and the rebuilding of recession-battered balance sheets in preparation for the economic turnround now forecast for the second half of 1992? Last year the early stage of this process coincided with the year-end reporting period. In something of an open season for rights issues, more than half the total Pounds 9.5bn taken from the market in 1991 was raised between mid-March and the end of June. This year analysts believe a similar amount could be raised, but that the institutional appetite may not be as great. There are also some doubts that banks will be willing or able to play a significant role in financing corporate recovery. In theory, companies should be gearing up financially as they move into a recovery cycle, in the same way that they should have been running debt down as they moved into recession in 1989. In practice, it is obvious that the corporate sector entered the recession far too highly geared. And despite substantial progress towards reducing debt last year - to a level called 'comfortable' in a recent Goldman Sachs report - the banks are in no mood to fall in line with the theory by encouraging a return to borrowing. Some bank balance sheets are themselves badly in need of a patch-up - if not actually a call on shareholders - so that all but the strongest companies are likely to be excluded from this route. 'The good quality companies will not want a lot from the banks because of their own cashflow or disposals,' says Mr Trevor Laugharne, a UK equity strategist at Kleinwort Benson. 'The problem is that there is not enough capital going from banks to small- and medium-sized companies at economic rates.' Many companies are, therefore, likely to turn again to rights issues - whether they go to the market voluntarily, like J Sainsbury, Tesco and Bass early in last year's flood of issues, or of necessity, like British Aerospace later on. The extent to which they will tap shareholders will depend in part on the market's fortunes. The majority view, expounded by the likes of Mr George Hodgson, an equity strategist at Warburg Securities, is that the FT-SE 100 Index is heading for the 2,900 level by the calendar year-end, on the back of earnings recovery and higher earnings multiples as the economy moves towards low inflation and low interest rates. Based on a similar forecast, Mr Bob Semple of County NatWest estimates another Pounds 10bn of rights issues this year - though they will probably come later in the year as few large companies appear prepared to risk going to the market in the run-up to the general election. A minority view, put forward by Mr Nick Knight, Nomura's head of strategy, is that the market has seen its top level with the industrial index already high at 15.5 times historic earnings. 'There will probably be a hung parliament and political uncertainty will continue throughout 1992,' he says. A Conservative election victory could only temporarily boost the market and companies thinking of a rights issue will gain only a marginal benefit from waiting. Mr Knight admits, though, that companies do not appear to be queueing up to launch cash calls at this time. This year's call on the capital markets will also differ from 1991 in that institutions are shifting the allocation of their assets. In simple terms, they are debating whether to cut the proportion of their portfolios in equities and increase the proportion in gilts - which are looking cheap as interest rates and inflation stabilise at the lowest levels for 20 years. 'The gilts weighting will go up and the institutions will have to finance a lot of the government's public sector borrowing requirement,' says Mr Hodgson. But even though institutions are likely to increase their weightings of gilts, this is likely to be at the expense of overseas holdings of bonds and equities rather than UK equities. Nervousness about Wall Street and the Tokyo stock market may in fact lead to less outflow of capital from the UK market. Mr Hodgson says that increased sterling stability within the Exchange Rate Mechanism could also encourage foreign investors to greet a Conservative election victory by increasing their investment in the UK market. This would be an additional source of funding for rights issues. Institutional reaction to the other route for companies to raise cash - the cutting of dividends - is likely to be hostile, despite the Governor of the Bank of England's suggestion last November that such cuts could be regarded as 'a mark of responsible and resolute management'. Institutions remember that when ICI cut its dividend by 26 per cent in 1981, it took eight years for the dividend to be restored in real terms. Given the relatively small contribution to the recovery cash pot from such a move, dividend cuts are likely to be low on a finance director's list of options.</p>

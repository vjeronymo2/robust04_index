			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / DTI halts action on Arrow chief The Department of Trade and Industry yesterday dropped proceedings against Mr Tony Berry, the former chairman and chief executive of the Blue Arrow employment services group, which sought to have him disqualified as a company director. More than two years after the DTI applied to the High Court for the disqualification - and only half an hour before Mr Berry was scheduled to appear in court for a procedural hearing on the case - Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said the department would not continue with its case. The department said it was abandoning the case, initiated in September 1992 when investigators published the results of a probe into Mr Berry's leadership of Blue Arrow, because legal counsel had advised Mr Heseltine that a disqualification would be difficult to obtain.

According to the report the circumstances of the Pounds 25m loan, to a company controlled by Mr Peter de Savary, the entrepreneur, and involving a property project on Canvey Island, Essex, were not disclosed to Blue Arrow's board, shareholders or the Stock Exchange. Mr Berry has always rejected the findings of the report. He has maintained his directorship on the board of Tottenham Hotspur Football and Athletic company, where he is deputy chairman. He resigned as chairman of Business Technology Group in October last year and is now chairman of Recruit, a private employment services company which he bought in December last year. When asked where he had found the funds to invest in Recruit, he said: 'I begged and borrowed, but I did not steal.'</p>

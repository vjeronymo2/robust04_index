			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Closure at Tula arms plant Russia's Tula arms factory stopped production yesterday for the first time in its 300-year history when it was unable to pay its workers, the Itar-Tass news agency reported yesterday. Customers, including the state, have not been paying the factory for orders and production at the plant, 175km south-east of Moscow, has fallen 97 per cent in three years. Only 40 per cent of the workers were paid in June and the factory did not pay anyone in July or August. Workers have been put on leave until October 1. The factory had tried to stay afloat by increasing its output of hunting weapons after it stopped making submachine guns, one of its last key military products, in January.</p>

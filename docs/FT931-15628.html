			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Legal Briefs: Top rate league table calls for clarification The US National Law Journal's recently published annual billing survey may throw welcome light on the question of whether the UK's top commercial law firms are the world's most expensive, charging more than Dollars 200 an hour in excess of their Wall Street counterparts. The International Financial Law Review 1000, which began the debate, credited partners in the most expensive Wall Street firms with a top hourly rate of Dollars 350 an hour. According to the NLJ survey, that appears a serious underestimate. The highest hourly rates for partners in New York City firms were steady last year at between Dollars 400 and Dollars 450, with some firms billing higher (Lord, Day and Lord Dollars 475, for example). The highest hourly rate reported to the NLJ was Dollars 500 charged by senior partners at Atlanta's Kilpatrick &amp; Cody. The IFLR 1,000 figures seem to reflect the top rates charged by partners in Los Angeles, Washington DC, Dallas, and Chicago. Several Chicago firms (Winston and Strawn Dollars 450, for example) now however charge New York rates.</p>

			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Ingenuity - The FT Engineering Review (6): The details that let the British down - Interview / Professor Kumar Bhattacharyya / Warwick Manufacturing's founder talks to Andrew Baxter about the UK's need to let young people use their talents IT WOULD be easy to get the impression from listening to Professor Kumar Bhattacharyya that the British engineering industry is suffering from terminal decline. The professor, who founded the influential Warwick Manufacturing Group in 1980, pinpoints a number of ills besetting manufacturing industry: a weak intellectual base, lack of attention to detail in product development, too many decision makers, managers who can cut but do not know how to grow companies  .. the list seems endless. But Prof Bhattacharyya acknowledges the good points too - such as the tremendous improvements made in reducing variable costs like wages, and the ability to develop products with less resources than competitors. Over the past 13 years Prof Bhattacharyya has turned Warwick into one of the largest groups of its kind in Europe, charged with the role of working with companies, mainly in engineering, to develop the people and technology to increase competitiveness. In the process he has become one of the most influential observers of the manufacturing scene, and is highly regarded by the government. The group's direct involvement in manufacturing industry both in Europe and in south-east Asia gives the professor a first-hand view of manufacturing trends and the ability to make comparisons. Looking back over the past 15 years or so, Prof Bhattacharyya says enormous improvements have been made in UK manufacturing's variable costs - wages, energy costs and raw materials. The shakeout has been helped by the Employment Act and the disappearance of government subsidies, which forced big companies to improve their variable costs and had a consequential effect on the whole supply chain. 'This created a lot of following wind, so we ought to be more competitive than we are,' says the professor. There are a number of linked reasons why this has not happened, he believes. First, he says, manufacturing industry's fixed costs have not been reduced compared with most competitor nations. 'It has only been in the last recession and this one that people started tackling that, because they could not reduce variable costs any further.' By fixed costs, Prof Bhattacharyya is not referring to tangible assets like buildings but to the decision-makers in management who are not adding value to the company. One of the problems, he says, is that managers are judged by their ability to cut costs so that they can meet budgets, rather than on how they can grow the business. Executives restructure a company but never stay long enough to sustain growth. 'When you want to grow, you don't know how to do it, and that's where the problem has been,' he says. 'Companies have only been getting high profits through restructuring, they have not had the vision to both grow and diversify.' But the problem goes deeper than that, he says. In the all important area of product development, there is a 'fuzziness' in decision-making, caused by an over-bureaucratic, class-ridden command structure where there are either too many decision-makers or people are scared of making a decision. With some exceptions, Prof Bhattacharyya says, the intellectual base of companies in the engineering sector is 'pretty weak'. This can lead to a slap-happy decision-making process in technology or other areas. The professor draws a comparison with the 'robustness' of the decision-making process in German and Japanese companies. 'When a German product comes out, it is technically robust because their decision-making process is very rigorous. In the UK we have the technology, it's better than most of our competitors. But our products are always late and come out with problems.' The professor believes this is because, while the UK is very good at the conceptual side of product development, it is in the detail where conversion to a real product takes place. 'We have great problems with details and controlling them. This is not a question of a company's intellectual horsepower, but one where you need teamwork. 'You get a technological edge from a combination of fuzzy things brought together - no single technology gives you an edge. The Japanese are able to bring these fuzzy things together quite easily. Their system is much more disciplined because of the attention to detail.' Prof Bhattacharyya says the education system as a whole should not be blamed for this deficiency - the UK's education system is not inferior to that of the Japanese, even if the German system has much more robustness in technology. But he does lament the disappearance of the old technical colleges. 'They used to teach all about detail, so the products came out pretty robust. That's gone, because everyone now wants to be a manager with a degree.' However, he does not believe the UK should be training thousands more engineers to solve these problems. The solution is for companies to exploit good people better, a task that Warwick Manufacturing Group has seen as one of its key roles - seeding companies with large numbers of talented young people. 'You've got to give people their head, let them use their talents in a very flexible way to contribute to the company,' he says. 'That is gaining ground in a lot of companies, but in a lot of others they just don't know how to utilise such people. You can't give them lousy jobs, they'll up and go.' And hiring - and exploiting - good people is the key to reducing the fixed cost base, because, as the professor puts it: 'One good chap can replace 10 chaps quite easily.' Prof Bhattacharyya's advice to British engineering companies is that they should exploit the advantages of their lower cost base as fully as possible over the next three to five years, as one can never be sure how long an advantage like low wage costs will last. 'Look at Mercedes, Volkswagen and Dasa (Deutsche Aerospace). Even now when you go there you are amazed by their robustness. What they need to do is get a little bit broader and say: 'That's a good product, how can we make it cheaper than our competitors?' 'The only thing they have to improve is their cost base. That's relatively easy - we did it.'</p>

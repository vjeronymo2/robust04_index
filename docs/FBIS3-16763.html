The higher court annuled the decision of the district  Shchelkovo court of February 25, which declared null and void  the results of the parliamentary elections last year in the  electoral district, in which Zhirinovskiy was elected to the the  lower chamber of the Russian legislature. The court ruled that  the decision was "inconsistent and surpassed the court's  competency."    A statement issued today by Zhirinovskiy's Liberal  Democratic  Party press service mockingly expressed "sympathy for certain  politicians and mass media who failed again in their campaign to  discredit Vladimir Zhirinovskiy."</p>

			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / Arts: Russian recitals - Edinburgh Festival When relations with Gorbachev's Soviet Union started to warm, the Edinburgh Festival was quick to fill its programmes with the country's finest opera companies. In the last couple of years we have regrettably seen less of them, but the link remains and a couple of recitals this year have reminded us of what we are missing. Even the great Russian bear only disgorges a voice like Galina Gorchakova's once in a generation. In arias by Verdi and Puccini at the Queen's Hall she let fly with singing of a vocal intensity that sent shivers down one's back, sometimes covering the voice to produce a black thunder-cloud of a sound, more often driving it straight ahead with searing ferocity. Here at last is a worthy successor to the inimitable Galina Vishnevskaya. Those, however, were just the encores at her morning recital on Friday. The intimacy of the hall demands songs rather than blazing operatic arias and Gorchakova's programme had been a broad selection of Russian composers, including Glinka, Dargomyzhsky, Balakirev and Rimsky-Korsakov - a brave choice, both for the unfamiliarity of the songs and because she was tackling inward-looking music that cannot be second nature to her. Restricted to drawing-room good manners, the voice behaves itself surprisingly well. Occasionally the pitch slipped just below the note when she was fining away the ends of quiet phrases, but the scale of the singing always made sense. Gorchakova is doubly fortunate that her soprano sounds as alive when she is singing softly as it does at full throttle. As a song interpreter, she seizes upon any opportunity to dramatise. Rachmaninov's vivid picture of a lonely poet gripped by panic in the black of night became a tense, first-hand experience. In Tchaikovsky's 'Do not believe, my friend' the passion of the central section was made to contrast strikingly with the down-hearted sorrow on either side. At her unforgettable recital at the 1992 festival Olga Borodina gave us a very different Tchaikovsky. These two singers are among the new stars of the Maryinsky Opera, which is entering a golden period under the artistic directorship of Valery Gergiev. They both use the services of his sister, Larissa Gergieva, as accompanist, but that does not mean that their singing comes out the same. It was fascinating to hear Gergieva making Tchaikovsky's 'Lullaby' so light and airy for Gorchakova, when it had been heavy with presentiment of danger for Borodina two years before. The mezzo returned this year to give her own Queen's Hall morning recital a couple of days earlier. (Gorchakova was in the audience, a sign of the Maryinsky's close company spirit.) She began in what I can best describe as 11-o'-clock-in-the-morning voice, not yet able to make phrases flow easily one into another. But once into her stride, she showed again (if briefly) why she has to be ranked one of the leading recitalists of today. There were just three Rachmaninov songs that touched greatness. What makes Borodina so special is her ability to create for a song a sound world of its own: 'How fair this place' a luminous, out-of-doors radiance; 'Oh, do not grieve' plumbing the darkest shadows of her deep mezzo; and 'Lilacs' brushed with soft pastel shades. Every song becomes an individual statement to be savoured and Borodina takes her time summoning her concentration for each in turn. The second half was cleverly planned to lead from a strong performance of Shostakovich's Spanish Songs to the real thing in Falla's Seven Spanish Folksongs. But the Mediterranean spontaneity of the Falla is foreign to Borodina's deeply thought-out singing and the cycle failed to take off. Her heart lies in St. Petersburg, a city which is proving to be the cradle of Russian singing for a whole new generation. The Queen's Hall series is sponsored by the Bank of Scotland</p>

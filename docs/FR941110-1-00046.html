			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The record indicates that producer members and their alternates should be selected from the production area at large. Since the production area is relatively small, this method should be adequate to ensure equitable representation on the committee. The record indicates that Walla Walla Sweet Onion production is currently located in Walla Walla County in Washington, and Umatilla County in Oregon, which together account for all of the production.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Hearing testimony indicated that the six persons selected to serve as grower members or alternates should be individuals who are producers, or officers or employees of producers. Persons selected to serve as handlers should be engaged in handling Walla Walla Sweet Onions. Such persons could be expected to have strong interests in the effects of committee decisions of Walla Walla Sweet Onion producers and handlers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To help ensure that the committee will not have a membership with partiality toward a single handling entity, the proposal also contains a provision that, at the time of selection, no more than two producer members may be affiliated with the same handler.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Testimony indicates that a producer member should have at least three years experience in the production of Walla Walla Sweet Onions. The proponents believe that because committee membership is a heavy responsibility requiring a high degree of individual initiative for what is done and how it is done, and cultural practices for Walla Walla Sweet Onions are diverse, it would take three years of experience producing Walla Walla Sweet Onions in order to become knowledgeable about the industry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the hearing, witnesses supported adding a public member to the committee. While the influence of consumers would be implicitly present in the deliberations of the producer and handler committee members, and all meetings would be public, the appointment of a public member would offer many advantages. One would be direct communication between industry members and the public member, who would have no connection with the industry and whose opinions would afford the industry an opportunity to discuss its problems and concerns with someone who would view these problems and concerns from outside the Walla Walla Sweet Onion industry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The public representative and that person's alternate should not be permitted to have a direct financial interest in the production, processing, financing, buying, packing, or marketing of Walla Walla Sweet Onions except as a consumer, nor be a director, officer, or employee of any firm so engaged. Such public representatives should be able to devote sufficient time and express a willingness to attend committee activities regularly and to familiarize themselves with the background and economics of the industry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;956.25 states that each member of the committee, including the public member, should have an alternate. This would ensure that all portions of the production area are adequately represented in the conduct of the committee's business and that the continuity of operation is not interrupted. The order should provide that alternate members should meet the same qualifications as their respective members, except for tenure and growing experience. They would act in the place and stead of their respective members during temporary absences. In the case of the death, removal, resignation, or disqualification of a member, the alternate should serve as member until a new member is selected and has qualified.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;956.21 states that, with the exception of initial members, the term of office of committee members and their respective alternates should be for three years and should begin on June 1 and end on May 31, or for such other three year period as the committee may recommend and the Secretary approve. The record indicates that the term of office should begin on June 1 because that is considered the beginning of the Walla Walla Sweet Onion crop year. The Walla Walla Sweet Onion shipping season generally ends in August and work begins again in September when growers begin seeding for the next year's crop. At that point in time, it can be determined which growers have remained in business and qualify to serve on the committee. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

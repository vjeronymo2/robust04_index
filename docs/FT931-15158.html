			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / How to redress the banks' balance: UK clearers must reform if they are to regain small business confidence Whether Britain's many ailing small businesses have been more demoralised by the insensitive behaviour of the UK clearing banks or by the government's management of the economy is a moot point. However, the chancellor has the opportunity to redeem himself in the coming fortnight, when he publishes his recommendations on how the small business loan market might be improved. The Treasury's review of this market began two months ago. It was triggered by widespread complaints by small companies that banks have caused needless damage by arbitrarily depriving them of credit or charging them too much for loans and other services. Mr Lamont, the chancellor, now has the submissions from most big banks and has also received the conclusions of a Bank of England study of interest rates and charges levied on small businesses. His original fear, that banks have not been passing on the benefit of base rate reductions to their small business customers, appears to have been unfounded. The Bank has concluded that lending margins - the difference between the base rate and rates charged to customers - have not changed significantly, though some banks have enjoyed a slight margin improvement. A small increase in margins might indeed have been justified. The risk of lending to small business rises in a recession, so perhaps banks should be rewarded for carrying this increased risk. On the other hand, banks have pushed up fees and commissions very sharply. New research by the analyst Terry Smith shows that the volume of banking transactions, such as cheque clearing, has stagnated over the past couple of years. But banks' revenue from fees and commissions on these transactions has been rising at 20 per cent a year - most of which is due to an increase in tariffs for all customers and the introduction of new tariffs. To a certain extent, the banks' imposition of new tariffs is to be welcomed. It is a sign that they are belatedly setting their charges at levels which correspond to the costs of providing particular services. However, the ability of the banks to raise their tariffs during a recession indicates there may be too little competition between them. Such a situation is a particular defect of the small business market, in which there are no more than 10 serious providers of loans. Just two banks, National Westminster and Barclays, have about half the market. The government's ability to alter the competitive environment is limited, though. In other industries it could perhaps launch a Monopolies Commission inquiry to assess whether the leading players should reduce their market shares by making disposals. However, to shed all or part of small business lending is next to impossible. No bank would buy a portfolio of small business loans from a rival without obtaining a close knowledge of the borrowers - and acquiring that knowledge is an arduous and time-consuming process. There are two other criticisms of banks which stick. Too often, they have withdrawn credit from particular customers for no good reason. In addition, they have also made mistakes, such as imposing charges when none was due. Personal customers can seek redress for banking errors by complaining to the banking ombudsman. Unincorporated businesses may also go to the ombudsman, though few are probably aware of their right to do so. But incorporated businesses can only seek redress in the courts, which is often a prohibitively expensive route. The Treasury is likely to recommend the creation of an ombudsman scheme for all small businesses, incorporated or unincorporated. It should have three roles: Like the existing ombudsman, it should adjudicate on complaints about alleged banking mistakes and impose reparations. When a complaint is not about a mistake but about the fairness of a bank's actions - in, for example, withdrawing credit or imposing heavy new charges  -the ombudsman should conduct a review and publish the conclusions. There would be no power to force a bank to reverse its decision. However, few banks would be likely to ignore the ombudsman's recommendation. The ombudsman should carry out an annual review of banks' lending and charging policies in general. This increase in market transparency would compensate for the lack of competition. The immediate reaction of most banks is to fight the creation of such an institution. However, they are wrong to do so. If the banks are to regain public confidence, they must be prepared to explain their policies and actions in public.</p>

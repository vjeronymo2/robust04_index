			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Mubarak wins 95% 'pledge of allegiance' PRESIDENT Hosni Mubarak won predictable backing to remain Egypt's head of state for a further six years in Monday's referendum, with official results yesterday showing 95 per cent of voters supported him, Mark Nicholson reports from Cairo. Mr Hassan al-Alfi, interior minister, told reporters that 15.1m Egyptians voted for Mr Mubarak, who was the sole candidate, and just 583,467 against. The turnout was put at 84 per cent of 18.9m eligible voters. Mr Alfi said 226,020 ballots were spoiled, giving Mr Mubarak more than 96 per cent of valid votes cast. Both the result and turnout are in line with figures given after the previous referendums which returned Mr Mubarak to his first two terms as Egypt's leader, a role he has held since replacing the assassinated Mr Anwar Sadat in 1981. The result of the October 1987 referendum was 97 per cent in favour, with an 88 per cent turnout. While the referendum was, as one diplomat put it, 'not so much an election as a chance to pledge allegiance', many journalists and diplomats who toured polling stations on Monday considered that official turnout figures strained credibility. Several stations visited in and around Cairo were receiving barely a trickle of voters and, even allowing that many public sector employers bussed voters from work to the polling stations at the end of the day, it appeared in many places that a majority of locals had not voted at all.</p>

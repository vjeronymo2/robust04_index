			<p><P> August 16, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A.'S SLUMS AND SLUMLORDS  </P> <P> We've read with interest the recent series on slumlords in Los Angeles. Of  particular interest was the July 31 article regarding Highland Federal Savings  and Loan. The president of Highland Federal, Ben Karmelich, is quoted as  saying, "We are an uncommon lender." Based on our limited experience with  Highland Federal we can attest to this statement in a positive fashion.  </P> <P> We have owned a single-family rental house for a number of years. The house is  approaching 50 years in age and needed major renovations, including plumbing,  new windows, re-stuccoing, etc. Despite the fact that there was sufficient  equity and a sound credit rating none of the savings and loans we contacted,  with the exception of Highland Federal, were willing to re-finance rental  property to provide funds for renovations.  </P> <P> Highland Federal did make the loan. The house was renovated extensively, we can  now point to it with pride, and Highland Federal holds a loan with a very  favorable equity ratio. In this instance by making an "uncommon loan" they have  helped to prevent the development of slum-like conditions.  </P> <P> RON and JUDY VANDERFORD  </P> <P> Burbank  </P></p>

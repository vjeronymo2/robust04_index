			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Thijs Woltgens, parliamentary leader of the </F> PvdA [Labor Party], by John Kroon and Kees Verstheeg; place and  date not given: "We Must Remain the Party of a Fair Deal for  All"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Woltgens] "Among the CDA  [Christian Democratic Appeal] it is already been decided, for  example, that pensions will remain frozen over the next four  years, regardless of any changes in wages. They therefore want  the pensioners to pay for the cost of unemployment. A major  difference compared to us is that we want to maintain the law on  the link between wages and benefits. If employment grows again,  benefits and pensions can again follow wages. And if employment  does not grow enough, we will, as has been the case for the last  three years, employ other instruments to ensure that people on a  minimum income -- and thus also pensioners -- can continue to  keep in step with general trends in wages."    "We have had a lot of crisis-like situations on this point.  We have taken a lot of criticism for this. It was a big  struggle every time in cabinet and it nearly tripped us up. In  hindsight, I am very pleased that we did this. We do not just  promise to do such things, we have shown that we actually do  them."    [NRC HANDELSBLAD] But the Central Plan Bureau forecasts that  unemployment will grow so quickly the wage-benefit link will not  be possible over the next four years. The CDA is simply drawing  the consequences from this.    [Woltgens] We have drawn up an election program in order to  ensure that such forecasts are not proved correct. The CDA  apparently does not believe in its own program which promises  jobs but states in advance that unemployment will increase so  much that people will not be able to count on benefits. Our aim  is for employment to increase more than would be the case if  policy remained unchanged. We hope to be creating 100,000 jobs  a year as soon as possible. During the early years of this  government we achieved this number at a time when economic  growth which was lower than that forecast. Why can this not  happen again ?    [NRC HANDELSBAD] Are you not being too optimistic which  means  that soon -- just as previously with the Law on Labor Disability  -- painful decisions will once again have to be taken ?    [Woltgens] No political party -- including us -- is going to  promise that purchasing power will remain the same. But you can  say that you will spread job opportunities equally over all  income groups. That is our point of departure, it is not that  of the CDA.    [NRC HANDELSBLAD] Your party leader, Kok, wants to take more  from the middle and higher income groups in order to continue to  fund pensions. Is that not the traditional response of the  PvdA, placing the burden on the strongest shoulders, while at  the same time attractiing middle income groups?    [Woltgens] It is a very traditional reaction and one which  must be maintained. But for the time being the crux of our  approach to funding pensions is that the contributing base must  be widened by increasing the number of people in employment. If  we achieve this, the contribution can remain within the limits.    We must remain the party of a fair deal. That is why we were  founded. Where does this lead? To what we have tried over  recent years, an evenly distributed growth in earnings. Not a  leveling of earnings, as was formerly the aim, but no widening  of the differences either.    [NRC HANDELSBLAD] Your point of departure is always growing  employment. Last Saturday in the NRC HANDELSBLAD your fellow  party members -- Van der Zwan and Geelhied -- made a couple of  recommendations in this connection, such as the formation of a  national elite in order to convince the people of the need for a  change. Do you agree with them?    [Woltgens] Did you hear any concrete proposal from them? I  understood that the elite would have the power to decide but  what would this elite actually do? There is a certain menace in  their words, but I don't see any practical proposals. I would  like to know -- before we transfer power to this small group --  exactly what it is that they intend to do with it.    [NRC HANDELSBLAD] Don't you take their analyses seriously?    [Woltgens] I can understand the sense of urgency of Timmer,  the head of Phillips, as his company must remain competitive  with countries in East Asia, although one may wonder as to  whether his tales of such a threat are not rather late. Japan  has been present on the world stage since 1905.    On the other hand, there is not going to be any  international  change, certainly not in the industrial pattern. We learned  from the RSV [shipbuilding company that went bankrupt] affair  that you cannot retain sectors which you must constantly  subsidize. Market gardening cannot be kept alive with veiled  subsidies in the form of lower gas prices. Not without reason  some will move to regions where the sun provides free energy, to  Morocco for example. I was therefore very surprised to hear  Lubbers say this week in Bleiswijk that gas prices for market  gardening could be reduced.    Nobody can imagine that we can compete with wage costs in  countries such as China. I was in China this year and noticed  that the Chinese are in turn getting worried about competition  from Vietnam. Between these two there is certainly a  two-percent difference in labor costs for bicycle bells. We  must concentrate on areas where we are in a better position, due  to our location, training and experience.    [NRC HANDELSBLAD] Does the desire for a new, common  challenge  appeal to you?    [Woltgens] I am totally in favor of such a common goal but  one which helps us return to full employment as quickly as  possible. Everybody must concentrate on this. Our living  standard, which was the focus of attention at last Saturday's  meeting, and relative social equality are things to be proud of,  although here and there we find the threat of dangerous ghetto  situations developing. But the way in which we have organized  our economy, the social cohesion and the limited number of  strikes is just one of our comparative advantages. It is just  eighteen months ago since people like Paul Kennedy and Lester  Thurow offered up Europe as an example to the world economy.    [NRC HANDELSBLAD] But since then our unemployment has  increased, especially among lower income groups.    [Woltgens] That is true, but since 1989 we have seen the  significant phenomenon that unemployment among those most  difficult to reintegrate, the long-term unemployed, decrease by  100,000. That is a quiet revolution.    [NRC HANDELSBLAD] So it appears, but in fact the Netherlands  has just included the long-term unemployed under the Law on  Labor Disability figures.    [Woltgens] That was true for the 1970s and 1980s, but not  for  recent years. The Law on Labor Disability system has changed so  much that this is not so easy any more.    [NRC HANDELSBLAD] The opinion polls do not indicate that the  PvdA's message --- aimed at the lower income groups as is the  case with the pension issue -- is getting across to the voter.    [Woltgens] I am not in principle a great believer in opinion  polls, which spares me from becoming annoyed, but I have the  feeling that we have bottomed. And we still have a whole  campaign before us.</p>

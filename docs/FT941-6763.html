			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / Survey of Jamaica (7): Banana suppliers battle it out - Agriculture is waking up to the challenge of international deregulation Jamaica's main agricultural exports, which have been the beneficiaries of preferential markets, are waking up to new challenges, and some dangers, from a changing international environment. The increasing deregulation of international trade and the progressive dismantling of preferences, the new General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), the planned World Trade Organisation, the emergence of a single European market and the implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement have all forced the island's sugar and banana sectors to prepare for changes which could affect protected markets. The serious threat is to the banana market in the European Union. Jamaica, and other traditional suppliers to the European market, are locked in a protracted and bitter dispute with Latin American producers who want a bigger share of the market. The Latin producers have attacked the EU's banana import regime, which was implemented in July of last year. The EU's new banana import regime imposes a 2m tonne per year quota for Latin American fruit. The imports attract duty of Ecu100 per tonne. Imports above this level will attract a duty of Ecu850 per tonne. Jamaican and other traditional suppliers, such as others in the Caribbean and those in Africa, will have access for the remainder of the EU's needs of about 1.5m tonnes per year. This fruit will pay no tariff. Jamaica's share of this is 105,000 tonnes, which the industry intends to meet in 1995, says Mr Marshall Hall, chief executive of the Jamaica Producers Group, which oversees the island's banana production. This volume of exports, if achieved, will represent a significant recovery for an industry which has been set back several times over the past 15 years by poor weather. Last year the industry did not achieve its export target of 80,000 tonnes, but was marginally above the 76,500 tonnes of 1992. From average exports of 150,000 tonnes in the 1960s, the industry declined in the 1970s; exports averaged 75,000 tonnes per year. A hurricane in 1980 and another in 1988 depressed exports in the 1980s to an average of 35,000 per year. 'So the 77,000 tonnes of 1993 indicates that the industry is back to the levels of production of the 1970s,' says Mr Hall. 'This recovery has also taken place with lower acreages but with higher yields. But earnings in 1993 were about six per cent less than those of 1992 because of the fall of the pound sterling against the US dollar.' The improvements in the industry are also reflected in higher yields. Three big farms now produce about 70 per cent of fruit exported; productivity has risen over the past 15 years from an average of three export tonnes per acre to nine per acre. But the banana exporters continue to look carefully at Gatt reaction to repeated challenges by Latin Americans to the European import regime. An open market in Europe would give the advantage to the more cost-efficient Latin producers and threaten viability of the Jamaican industry. The sugar industry's preferential market in the EU is under no immediate threat, but there are latent concerns in the industry that this could change. On an open market, the industry would be uncompetitive. From peak production of just over half a million tonnes in the 1960s, Jamaica's sugar output has declined steadily. Last year's production was 225,000 tonnes. The industry's target is 260,000 tonnes per year to meet its guaranteed markets  -126,000 tonnes to the EU, 116,000 tonnes for domestic consumption and 15,000 tonnes for the US market. Production costs in Jamaica are about 19 US cents per pound, higher than world market prices. The industry survives only because the EU market pays 23 US cents per pound and the US pays 21.7 cents. The sugar industry is preparing for change. The government recently sold four of five state-owned mills to local and foreign investors who have promised to refurbish the plants and increase production. The investors spent Dollars 43.8m for mills with a cumulative rated capacity of 270,000 tonnes per year. Tate and Lyle of the UK is in one consortium which bought three of the mills. The government says state-owned cane farms will be divested over the next two years. Proceeds from the sale of the mills will be used by the government to settle the industry's outstanding obligations, including the repayment of Dollars 16m to the World Bank and Dollars 13.5m for redundancy payments to workers. Government officials say they hope that the new owners' improvements to the mills will lift Jamaica's sugar production in two years to about 350,000 tonnes per year. And they hope divestment of the mills will make Jamaica's industry more competitive by reducing production costs by about one third.</p>

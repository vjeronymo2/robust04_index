			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, April 11 (TANJUG) -- The Yugoslav  Government on Monday [11 April] most energetically condemned the  United Nations decision to engage NATO forces to air raid the  territory of the Bosnian Serb republic (R.S.) in the area of  Gorazde, and qualified the decision as direct involvement in the  civil war in the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina  on the side of the Muslims.    At a session devoted to the latest development, the Yugoslav  Government took the stand that the world organization had  assumed the role of a side in conflict and, thereby, set a  dangerous precedent which could have far-reaching consequences,  the released federal government statement said.    The Yugoslav Government underscored that the U.N. had taken  the decision on the air strike without previously fulfilling the  assumed obligation to demilitarize Gorazde, and that it had,  moreover, tolerated the planning and carrying out of the Muslim  offensive operations from the U.N.-proclaimed "safe area" of  Gorazde on Bosnian Serb positions around that town.    Gorazde and five other towns in Bosnia-Herzegovina were  proclaimed "safe areas" by the U.N. last spring, upon which they  were supposed to be demilitarized. However, Gorazde was used in  late March this year for an attack on the Bosnian Serb positions  around the town. Around 10,000 Muslim troops were engaged in  the atack.    The fighting in the area of Gorazde has been provoked by the  Muslim side, both according to Bosnian Serb military sources and  reports of the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR). The Muslim  attack from Gorazde was launched as part of an all-out Muslim  spring offensive, with a view to winning territories before the  internationally brokered peace talks on Bosnia-Herzegovina  resume.    It was only after the Muslim spring offensive failed that  the  U.N. remembered that Gorazde was a U.N.-protected "safe area"  and invited NATO bombers to raid the Muslim-attacked Serb side,  the federal government said.    "It is regrettable that precisely the United Nations, the  organization duty-bound by its charter to preserve peace and  international security, has taken a step which threatens the  peace process and causes an escalation of war, the [words  indistinct] has seriously discredited itself as a peace force in  former Bosnia-Herzegovina and assumed the responsibility for all  the consequences of possible further uncontrolled developments,"  the federal government said.    The Yugoslav Government reiterated that "the way out of the  crisis in former Bosnia-Herzegovina is not the policy of double  standards and the siding of the world organization or other  factors with any side whatsoever in the Bosnian civil war, but  it is in equal treatment of all warring parties and impartial  and unselfish assistance to the peace process."    "Each and every departure from this principle serves only to  strengthen the Muslim side in its conviction that by  persistently sabotaging peace efforts and by continuing military  hostilities it can win the civil war," the Yugoslav Government  statement said.    The Yugoslav Government called on the U.N. immediately to  abandon the "irresponsible and dangerous policy of joining in  the war on the side of the Muslims" and to strive for peace and  an immediate, unconditional and lasting end to the war.    The Yugoslav Government reiterated its continued commitment  to a "principled and peaceful policy in the solution of the  crisis in former Bosnia-Herzegovina," and said that the Federal  Republic of Yugoslavia would continue to lend the necessary  support to all constructive efforts aimed at reducing the  current tensions, effecting an unconditional and lasting  cessation of hostilities, and achieving a comprehensive and  equitable political solution to the crisis in the former  Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

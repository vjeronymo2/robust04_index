			<p><P> June 30, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PANEL OKS SWEEPING OFFSHORE DRILLING DELAY;  </P> <P> UNPRECEDENTED STEP IN HOUSE COVERS 84 MILLION ACRES OF COASTLINE, INCLUDING ALL  OF CALIFORNIA'S  </P> <P> A key House committee Thursday approved the most sweeping moratorium on  offshore oil exploration ever enacted, putting 84 million acres of U.S.  coastline -- including the entire California coast -- off limits from new  drilling until October, 1990.  </P> <P> The action, which lifted the ban past its most formidable hurdle, marks a major  victory for those who have urged new caution toward oil exploration in the  aftermath of a series of major oil spills across the United States.  </P> <P> It would effectively give Congress new control over a number of controversial  offshore drilling plans, short-circuiting an aggressive effort by the Bush  Administration to forge a consensus on the issue and unshackle itself from  congressional limits.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bitter Response  </P> <P> In a bitter response, Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. assailed Congress for  "shooting at the wrong target" in failing to focus on the oil tankers held  responsible for recent spills. To demonstrate the Administration's outrage, he  announced plans to allow oil companies to begin drilling in a new 28  million-acre, oil-rich swath of the Gulf of Mexico.  </P> <P> The new congressional moratorium, approved on a voice vote by the House  Appropriations Committee as part of a larger package, would go far beyond an  existing drilling ban for Northern and Southern California, which has been  imposed each year since 1981.  </P> <P> The expanded ban would, for the first time, cover a proposed lease sale off  Central California and include vast regions in Alaska's Bristol Bay and off  several mid-Atlantic states. Also included in the ban are areas off southern  Florida and George's Bank, off Massachusetts.  </P> <P> In an unprecedented step, the moratorium would also afford California the added  protection of a ban even on pre-lease drilling activities, such as  environmental studies -- a step certain to cause delays in the Interior  Department's drilling timetable.  </P> <P> "This is a critical victory at a critical time," said California Rep. Leon E.  Panetta (D-Monterey), sponsor of the drilling moratorium.  </P> <P> Another Californian, Rep. Mel Levine (D-Santa Monica), added, "We have  effectively brought the entire sale process to a screeching halt."  </P> <P> Rep. Bill Lowery (R-San Diego), a longtime opponent of offshore drilling, said  Thursday that he was "ecstatic" about the vote. "This is the best victory we've  had in this seven-year fight," said Lowery, a member of the committee that  approved the moratorium.  </P> <P> Lowery said the six-vote margin of victory was significant because previous  committee votes regarding offshore drilling usually hinged on one or two votes.  The success was all the sweeter, Lowery said, because it represented the first  time pre-lease activity off the California coast has been restricted.  </P> <P> Lowery warned that Thursday's vote was only "one more major skirmish in a long  battle." The bill must still be approved by the full House, then by a  House-Senate conference committee.  </P> <P> Lowery and other opponents of offshore drilling said they believe that  worldwide coverage of recent oil spills may help persuade Congress that a  permanent ban on drilling in sensitive areas is needed. "I've contended all  along the technology is not there for spills," Lowery said. "Sadly, the Exxon  Valdez and events of recent weeks have proven me correct."  </P> <P> Others warned, however, that to put vast areas of the U.S. coastline off limits  to offshore drilling represented a decision to cede control over U.S. energy to  foreign oil producers.  </P> <P> "This says that the energy policy of the United States is to do nothing,"  warned Rep. Ralph Regula (R-Ohio), the principal opponent of the measure.  </P> <P> Before becoming law, the moratorium must first be adopted by both the full  House and Senate. But officials on both sides of the drilling debate said they  expect the measure to be approved in light of the current climate of concern  over oil exploration and its hazards.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Opposes Measure  </P> <P> While the Administration strongly opposes the measure, it is regarded as  virtually veto-proof because it is included as an amendment to a vital  supplemental spending measure that President Bush would be unlikely to block.  </P> <P> If enacted, the moratorium would severely limit the influence of a White House  task force appointed by Bush to advise him on whether drilling should proceed  in controversial areas off Northern and Southern California and Florida's Gulf  Coast.  </P> <P> The task force, which has been seeking to strike a balance between the concerns  of environmentalists and the nation's energy needs, has been instructed to make  recommendations to Bush by the end of the year. Under the moratorium, however,  the department would be unable to act until October, 1990, leaving Congress  time to challenge any drilling plans that it still might find unacceptable.  </P> <P> "The task force has, for the most part, become irrelevant," said Robert Hattoy,  the Sierra Club's Southern California regional director.  </P> <P> Interior Department spokesman Steve Goldstein said the panel will continue its  work.  </P> <P> "It's quite clear that Congress is trying to usurp the actions of the task  force, and we just don't believe that's correct or proper," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Little Controversy  </P> <P> The new area put up for lease Thursday by the Interior Department lies off the  coasts of Texas and Louisiana. The proposed drilling there has generated little  controversy.  </P> <P> The heated debate over the drilling moratorium was made more ferocious by sharp  differences among legislators over the lessons that should be drawn from the  series of recent oil spills, including the damage caused in Alaska's Prince  William Sound by 10 million gallons of crude oil that leaked from the tanker  Exxon Valdez.  </P> <P> Environmentalists and anti-drilling forces have contended that the experience  should make lawmakers more cautious about all forms of oil exploration. While  drilling has resulted in few spills, they noted that much of the oil gathered  offshore must be transported to land by tankers.  </P> <P> But the Administration, the oil industry and their supporters countered that  new regulations ought to aim specifically at oil tankers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Imports Grow  </P> <P> "We understand that emotions are running high. . . ," the American Petroleum  Institute said in a statement. "(But) the rash of tanker accidents does not  reflect on offshore drilling safety and does not change the fact that domestic  production of oil continues to fall while imports continue to grow."  </P> <P> The dispute was focused most directly on the effort to include Alaska's Bristol  Bay in the new moratorium. The oil industry already has paid $95 million for  drilling rights in the region, but Alaskan officials demanded the protection in  the amendment out of concern that another spill could devastate the state's  economy.  </P> <P> Noting that years of environmental studies had deemed Bristol Bay safe for  drilling, Regula warned, "If we can't drill here, we can't do it anywhere."  </P> <P> But the committee, on a 29-22 vote, rebuffed his proposal to strip the region  from the package.  </P> <P> The special protection for the California coastline came under a provision  preventing the Interior Department from conducting pre-leasing activity along  the entire coast until October, 1990.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Survived Attack  </P> <P> The provision survived an attack by Rep. Lindy Boggs (D-La.), who noted that  the Interior Department needs up to 26 months to complete all of the steps  necessary to lease an offshore oil tract. The pre-lease ban thus could extend  the moratorium on drilling for up to two years, Boggs argued.  </P> <P> But a powerful coalition of Californians and others who voiced concern about  the recent oil spills defeated the Boggs amendment by a decisive 28-22 margin.  </P> <P> David Coggin, Washington chief of staff for Rep. Ron Packard (R-Oceanside),  said, "The majority of the delegation working on this really did a good job,  they really worked on getting those undecided or marginal votes to switch. Of  course, having three oil spills the week before didn't hurt."  </P> <P> Because Lease Sale 95 -- off Carlsbad, Oceanside and Camp Pendleton -- and  Lease Sale 91 off Northern California have already been subjected to most  pre-lease steps, the additional postponement would most likely affect Lease  Sale 119, a massive portion of the Outer Continental Shelf off Central  California.  </P> <P> The Interior Department currently plans to begin oil exploration there in 1991.  If the pre-lease moratorium is imposed through 1990, however, the auction of  drilling rights for the Central California tract would almost certainly be  stalled until 1992.  </P> <P> That delay "is very welcome news to Southern Californians," Levine said.  </P> <P> "It says to the oil industries . . . that they would be much better off  dropping this fight," he said.  </P> <P> Rep. Barbara Boxer (D-Greenbrae), a fervent anti-drilling advocate whose  district includes sensitive shoreline along Point Reyes and San Francisco, said  she is "extremely pleased" with the committee vote on the new moratorium.  </P> <P> Recent oil spills have evoked "a real sentiment that we have to be  extraordinarily careful in the whole offshore oil drilling process," Boxer  said. Now, she said, Congress "may well be ready" for legislation that would  put areas permanently off limits to offshore drilling.  </P></p>

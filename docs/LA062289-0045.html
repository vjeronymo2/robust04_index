The organizers wanted an Islamic "holy war" in  which they would drive non-Muslim groups out of Uzbekistan, the official  charged, stating the aim as "the revival of medieval nationalist hysteria,  discrimination and ousting of the republic's European population." When the  Meskhetians, a minority Muslim group of Turkish descent, declined to join  Uzbeks in the front, violence flared between the two groups.  </P></p>

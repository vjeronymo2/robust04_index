			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / Marcel Bich: a purveyor of the disposable leaves indelible mark - The death of the creator of the Bic line There are a handful of businessmen and women in France whose personalities are so powerful that they are deemed by the media to have earned the epithet of le grand patron. Baron Marcel Bich was one. Baron Bich, who died on Monday at the age of 79, was one of the dynamic industrialists who breathed new life into the French economy during the post-war years. He not only created a world-class company in Bic, but his disposable pens, lighters and razors changed the everyday lives of ordinary people by introducing them to a new generation of inexpensive, practical products. Despite his aristocratic title, the story of Baron Bich is an archetypal entrepreneurial tale. He was born in Turin, the son of an Italian engineer who emigrated to France with his family. The young Marcel took French citizenship as a teenager. He then earned his living as a door-to-door salesman before studying law at Paris university. Baron Bich worked in Britain in the 1930s, as production director of Stephens &amp; Swan, the stationery manufacturer. But he returned to Paris, where he began his own business after the war. He started off with a small ink factory but in 1953 he scored the coup of his career by buying the patent rights to a ballpoint pen designed by Ladislao Biro, a Hungarian. The biro's launch brought out the best of Baron Bich as a marketer. His handy 50-centime version of the old-fashioned fountain pen was the perfect product for the never-had-it-so-good consumers of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. Roland Barthes, the French intellectual, wrote an essay hailing it as an icon of contemporary consumption. The Bic biro also made the baron one of the few industrialists whose name has slipped into the vernacular. The Bic group diversified into disposable lighters in 1973 and razors in 1976. The baron then dabbled in acquisitions by buying DIM, the hosiery manufacturer, and Rosy, the lingerie company. But he was far from infallible. His foray into the fragrance market in 1988, with the introduction of Bic perfume, was a flop. Despite the demands of his business, Baron Bich always conformed to the cliche of the grand patron by being a larger-than-life character who lived his life to the full. He had 11 children one of whom, Bruno, succeeded him as chairman of Bic when he reluctantly gave up the reins three years ago. The baron also loved sailing and raced his yacht, the France, four times in the America's Cup. His press pictures invariably portray him beaming from the helm clad in a spruce linen suit and snowy white cap. It was the closest the media got to him. Baron Bich gave his last press interview in 1969. He did not like what the journalist wrote and saw no need to bother being interviewed again.</p>

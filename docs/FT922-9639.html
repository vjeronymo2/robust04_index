			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Economic growth to top European finance ministers' talks ECONOMIC growth in Europe is likely to top the agenda at this weekend's informal meeting of European Community finance ministers in Oporto, northern Portugal. High European interest rates, rising public sector indebtedness, and sluggish growth prospects prompted Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the French prime minister, to write to his EC counterparts urging a high level discussion on promoting EC growth. Mr Jorge Braga de Macedo, Portugal's finance minister, yesterday said that the ministers would seek concerted action through a Community-wide 'non-inflationary growth policy'. He also said that the ministers would examine several structural impediments to European growth and review concerted means of eliminating these obstacles. Ministers are expected to examine developments towards the single market and ways to promote competition in the non-tradeable goods sector, including services, distribution and the labour and capital markets. 'There is scope for initiatives in these areas,' Mr Braga de Macedo said. A paper from the Committee of Central Bank governors on stage two of European Monetary Union, due to start in January 1994, will attempt to define some of the steps involved. The thorny issue of choosing a site for the European Monetary Institute (EMI), which would be converted into a European central bank by 1999 at the latest, is expected to be raised separately. Other topics include requests by non-EC countries for their currencies to be linked formally to the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System. Ministers are also expected to discuss broadening EC economic assistance to all the republics of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), as well as the possible extension of European Investment Bank activities to Latin America. Discussion of the Community's 1993-97 budget is expected to focus on improving budgetary discipline and transparency by raising efficiency and reducing bureaucracy. 'Some (Community) procedures are far too slow, and we want to find ways to ensure that taxpayers' money is not wasted,' Mr Braga de Macedo said.</p>

			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Light van sales higher in February Sales of light vans made their long-awaited upturn last month, broadening the commercial-vehicle market recovery to every sector except buses, coaches and utility four-wheel-drive vehicles. In some areas of the market the sales surge last month reached spectacular levels, with the important heavy trucks sector - over 15 tonnes - up 31.9 per cent compared with February last year. Statistics from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders show that sales of light vans - mainly those derived from cars - rose 5.9 per cent, to 5,334 from 5,037, reversing a long declining trend. Sales of larger panel vans, typified by the Ford Transit, were 14.8 per cent higher last month than in the same period a year ago, at 7,040 from 6,133. Leyland Daf, recovering from the former Daf group's term in receivership early last year, said: 'The market has definitely turned. Dealers are reporting many more inquiries being turned into orders and we're now seeing fleet customers who we haven't talked to for a considerable time.' It is increasing weekly output from 200 vans to 250. The market for trucks - vehicles over 3.5 tonnes - was up 11.95 per cent last month, the statistics show. Last month's 8.13 per cent rise in total new commercial vehicle registrations, to 16,312 from 15,085 a year ago, raised the total for the first two months of the year to 33,954, a 4.46 per cent rise from 32,503 in the same period last year. Imports continue to take a larger share. They rose to 42.57 per cent last month compared with 40.95 per cent in the previous February, and to 42.62 per cent in the first two months compared with 39.89 per cent in the same period last year.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UK COMMERCIAL VEHICLE REGISTRATIONS JANUARY-FEBRUARY 1994  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                            Volume      Volume   Share (%)    Share (%)                           (Units)  Change (%)  Jan-Feb 94   Jan-Feb 93  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Total Market*              33,954      32,503      100.00       100.00 Imports                    14,472      +11.62       42.62        39.89  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Small vans (up to 1.8 tonnes) Total                      11,445       -4.59      100.00       100.00 Imports                     4,534       +3.56       39.62        36.47 Ford                        4,962      -11.77       43.36        46.88 Vauxhall (GM)               3,277      -23.17       28.63        35.56 Peugeot (incl.

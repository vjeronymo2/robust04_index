			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We believe that this policy of providing affected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recipients the right to appeal the State's action in reducing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment levels in these cases is not required by the Act or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by fundamental principles of procedural due process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, in the past, this policy has had a needless  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative impact on us since we do not control, nor can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> we alter, the State-initiated mass change. This impact was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrated most recently when a large federally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administered State supplementary payment State, as a result  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of a State law change, initiated an across-the-board  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduction in its State supplementary payment levels. Over  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 27,000 affected individuals appealed to us the resulting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduction, suspension, or termination of their State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supplementary payments on the basis that the State-initiated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mass change was unfair to them, and not because they wished  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to dispute the resulting computation of their benefits. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vast majority of affected individuals requested benefit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continuation at the previously established payment levels,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pending issuance of decisions on the initial appeals, as set  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> forth in &sect;416.1336(b). SSA provided appeal opportunities to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individuals. It then informed them that their appeals were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> denied on the basis that SSA had no authority to order the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State to repeal its law and reinstate State supplementary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payments to their former higher levels. Since States must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide the funding for State supplementary payments, in some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cases the State incurred additional program costs while the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individuals' appeals were pending. Processing these actions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> served only to exacerbate existing workload backlogs by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> diverting scarce workpower resources from other necessary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service delivery activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The courts have stated clearly that the legal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sufficiency of an agency's procedures with respect to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recipients of public assistance who are experiencing such a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mandated change in their entitlement will be measured first  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under an agency's statute and regulations. If no violation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the statute or regulations is found, then it must be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined if the agency's procedures violate constitutional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> due process requirements. In  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Atkins  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Parker,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 472 U.S. 115  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1985), the United States Supreme Court considered whether  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Food Stamp Act required that an individual hearing be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided for every household affected by a general change in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the law. The Court found that the Food Stamp Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distinguished between an adverse action based on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particular facts of an individual case, on the one hand, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a mass change initiated by the State or Federal Government  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affecting the entire caseload of recipients or significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> portions thereof, on the other hand, with Congress only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contemplating hearings on individual fact-based adverse  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Our existing regulations do not relieve us from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> providing appeal rights to recipients for mass change actions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in their State supplementary payments. Nevertheless, we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believe that there is no requirement in the Act that we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide a recipient of a federally administered State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supplementary payment an opportunity to appeal a reduction,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suspension or termination of his or her payments resulting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from a State-initiated mass change, if that individual does  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not dispute the application of that mass change to the facts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of his or her case. Like the Food Stamp Act, only appeal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rights with respect to individual adverse actions appear to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be contemplated under the Social Security Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With regard to constitutional due process requirements,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> we believe that those requirements mandate that an individual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whose benefits are reduced, suspended or terminated as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result of a State-initiated mass change be afforded the full  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measure of appeal rights in a matter in which he or she  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disputes the application of that mass change to the facts of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> his or her particular case, that is, in a case where the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recipient alleges that we have improperly computed his or her  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> benefits as a result of the mass change. In  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Goldberg <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Kelly,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 397 U.S. 254 (1970), the United States Supreme Court  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> held that fundamental notions of due process of law required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that individuals who sought to challenge the termination of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their public entitlements as ``resting on incorrect or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> misleading factual premises or on misapplication of rules or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> policies to the facts of particular cases'' be afforded a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hearing in which they could ``defend by confronting any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adverse witnesses and by presenting *&blank;*&blank;* arguments and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evidence orally.''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Id <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . at 268.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

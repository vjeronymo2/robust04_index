			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / International Company News: Restructuring lifts Elron Electronic ELRON Electronic Industries, which groups several leading Israeli high-technology companies, announced net profits for 1991 of Dollars 20.3m, up almost threefold from Dollars 7m the previous year, due mainly to one-time gains from a restructuring of its holdings. The sale on the New York over-the-counter market of more than 10 per cent of Elbit, its principal affiliate, was chiefly responsible for a contribution of Dollars 11.8m to total revenues of Dollars 27m made by sales of stock in group companies. The sale reduced Elron's holding in Elbit, which makes military electronics and computer-based medical imaging equipment, to 44.3 per cent from 55 per cent. Elron, established in the 1960s, has a record as a pioneer among Israeli private sector companies in both military and civilian high-technology products, with the vast majority of sales outside Israel. Itself quoted on Nasdaq, Elron's main companies, Elbit, Elscint, Fibronics and Optrotech are also quoted on New York markets. Combined sales by Elron companies reached Dollars 555m in 1991 compared with Dollars 521m in 1990. Elbit and Elscint were the best performers, while Optrotech and Fibronics, in the printed circuit board and fibre-optics markets, respectively blamed recession for lower sales and lower margins. During 1991, Elron paid down its debt to zero. It was also due yesterday to complete a stock placement with Israeli institutions to raise more than Dollars 20m with a view to financing further expansion. Net earnings per share in 1991 came to Dollars 1.26, against 46 cents in 1990.</p>

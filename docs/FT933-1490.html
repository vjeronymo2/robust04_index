			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Government Bonds: Prices see-saw as traders take cue from Moscow EUROPEAN bond markets had another volatile day, sliding at the start, then clawing back most of their losses through the session, only to slip again in after-hours futures trading. Prices were buffeted by the Russian crisis, and continuing uncertainty there is expected to keep activity choppy in the next few days. Investor selling was limited, however. 'Some positions were liquidated, but there was no panic selling,' said Mr John Hall, European economist at Swiss Bank Corporation. Indeed, many investors used the early falls as a buying opportunity, traders said. 'Most people have adopted a wait-and-see stance and won't do anything drastic until the picture clears up in Russia,' said a London trader. GERMAN bonds had an active session, with the Bund contract on Liffe hitting record volume at over 164,000 contracts, up from the previous peak of 147,603 on March 4. Traders marked down prices early, but Bunds recovered during the day on the growing perception that Mr Boris Yeltsin was gaining the upper hand in the Russian power struggle. Sentiment was lifted by reports that the Russian military would support Yeltsin, reducing the threat of civil war. However, in after-hours trading, the Bund future sold off sharply as short-term traders took profits. Moreover, many dealers were reluctant to hold long positions overnight. Germany's strong political and economic ties with the former Soviet Union makes its markets particularly vulnerable to turmoil there. FRENCH bonds took their cue from Bunds, recouping early losses and easing back late in the day. Most investors remained on the sidelines, leaving the market largely in the hands of futures traders. The government's announcement of the 1994 budget had no effect on bond prices. 'It contained no surprises, and was relatively small news compared to the events in Russia,' said Mr Joe Chan, who trades French bonds at Morgan Stanley. The Bank of France is not expected to cut its 6.75 per cent repo rate at today's open-market operation. According to Dominique Barbet, economist with Paribas Capital Markets, the central bank will likely wait for German money market rates to ease and for its own foreign currency reserves to be replenished before cutting rates again. UK gilts were dragged lower by other European markets. In the cash market, traders reported switching out of ultra-long maturities into the new 6 3/4 per cent gilts, which are trading on a when-issued basis ahead of next Wednesday's auction. According to analysts at market research firm IDEA, there is concern that foreign interest in the paper will be low because it is 11-year stock. Others, however, saw the gilts market cheapening enough for the auction to go well, they noted. JAPANESE government bonds eased back after Tuesday's rally on position-squaring ahead of today's national holiday. The JGB December contract closed at 111.93, down from Tuesday's 112.23 close. AFTER a quite morning, when political tensions in Russia kept investors and traders on tenterhooks, US Treasury bonds posted strong gains at the long end of the maturity range following a successful auction of five-year notes. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  17/32 at 102 3/16 , yielding 6.085 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was up 1/32 at 99 15/16 , to yield 3.891 per cent. Although Tuesday's fears that Russia might disintegrate into chaos appear to have abated, concern about the situation, and buying of shorter-dated securities as a safe haven during unsettling political times remained a feature of the bond market yesterday. Trading, however, was subdued throughout the morning session. It was not until the afternoon that business, and prices, began to pick up at the long end.</p>

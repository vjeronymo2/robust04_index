			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Otto Latsis article: "Russia's Weapons -- The Threat to </F> Their Security. People Involved in Accidents With Weapons and  Ammunition Talk on This Topic"]    [Text] The usual process will doubtless follow in the wake  of the blast at the ammunition dump near Vladivostok: A  commission will be set up to investigate the causes, criminal  proceedings will be instigated "in the light of the facts,"  promises will be made to get the bottom of the matter and report  all the details to the public, and then there will probably be a  desire to forget about what has happened as quickly as possible.  But even if some day we do find out something reliable and  noteworthy regarding the circumstances which led to this  incident, it is already too late to be satisfied with such  information.    Let us recall the accidents of statewide and even  international significance which Russia's Armed Forces have  "bequeathed" to us over a short period in the Vladivostok area  alone: Two terrible explosions at ammunition dumps; the tragedy  on Russkiy Island (regarding which, it was recently announced,  no proper conclusions have yet been reached); and the  international furor occasioned by the dumping of radioactive  waste. The problem of processing and storing this waste has not  yet been resolved. And across the country as a whole? Merely  listening to an account of the attack carried out by a single  mentally unbalanced soldier, without any special preparations,  on the guard of a nuclear missile complex in the Altay is enough  to make your hair stand on end. What would happen if a gang of  blackmailers were to repeat this "experiment" with special  preparations? After all, bandits -- whether in the capital or  the distant backwoods -- and participants in armed conflicts in  CIS countries open fire daily using firearms that have been  seized, stolen, or bought from our Army.    We need to look the truth in the eye: Russia's weapons have  become one of the principal threats to its security. We can and  must pinpoint and eliminate omissions in the organization of  weapons and ammunition storage, strengthen discipline, and so  forth. But in addition we must acknowledge that the military  shield forged during the 50 years since World War II is so heavy  that it threatens to crush us.    I am not talking about buttressing those serving in the  Russian Armed Forces today. The problem was created by the  generation of political and military leaders who have just  retired. It became evident when Stalin, through his support for  North Korean aggression, frightened the Western world with the  threat of communist expansion, and it deepened when Khrushchev,  by frightening the world with enormous superbomb tests, refused  to heed the warnings of the bomb's creator A.D. Sakharov;  finally, the problem took on a disastrous turn when the Brezhnev  team switched from a policy of military sufficiency to one of  military parity. Defense parity not backed up by industrial  parity proved too much for our economy and exhausted it even  more than the inefficient antimarket system, thus making  spasmodic and ill-prepared reforms an inevitability. Parity  isolated the Soviet Union politically. Finally, having turned  the heads of the political and military leaders of the time,  defense parity dragged our military into Afghanistan, Africa,  and Latin America, even across the equator.    Hopefully, bitter experience has convinced our current  leaders that such a policy is ruinous. But it is not enough  merely to realize this, it seems. Events such as the explosion  near Vladivostok demonstrate that there is another purely  technical or technical-economic problem: We clearly lack the  funds to properly ensure the upkeep of our hypertrophied defense  industry. The problem is compounded by the fact that all this  coincides with the extremely complex task of withdrawing troops  from both inside and outside the CIS and the worsening of  servicemen's social hardships. The need for expenditure to  improve the upkeep of hardware is directly at variance with the  need to spend money on the upkeep of personnel. There is just  one way out: Cut the Armed Forces' weapons and manpower more  quickly and decisively than has been done up to now.    It is apparently more expensive to cut back the Armed  Forces than it is to continue funding them. The following  example is cited: When an officer is discharged early into the  reserve, he must be paid 20 times his monthly salary. This is  an unconvincing example, as any economist will immediately  recognize. One-shot items of expenditure should never be  directly compared with ongoing expenditure. If severance pay is  viewed as an investment made in order to reduce current  expenditure in the future, then reimbursement in 20 months' time  is an excellent time frame by any economic standard.    According to data from INTERFAX, this year Russia will need  600 billion rubles [R] to recycle its military hardware.  Overall, the recycling program will cost R3.5 trillion in 1994  prices. This was announced by Russian First Vice Premier Oleg  Soskovets at a joint session of the collegium of the Russian  State Committee for the Defense Sectors of Industry and the  Udmurtia Council of Ministers held in Izhevsk Monday [16 May].  O. Soskovets also announced that by the year 2000 we will have  to recycle 150 submarines, 7,500 tanks, and 20,000 artillery  pieces and other types of hardware.    It makes sense to find the money to accelerate this process  even at the cost of cutting expenditure on state investment in  the national economy. Because the payoff could in fact come  even earlier if we bear in mind that an able-bodied officer  could leave the Army and get involved in productive activity,  and that the material resources that are currently spent on the  upkeep of superfluous weapons could be channeled into social and  economic objectives. But, most important of all, here we have a  case where not everything can be measured in terms of an  economic transaction alone. It is worth any amount of money to  reduce the risk of accidents like the one at Vladivostok, let  alone the incident in the Altay.</p>

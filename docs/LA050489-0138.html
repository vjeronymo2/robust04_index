			<p><P> May 4, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOOK TO THE FABULOUS FLAVORS AND LOW-CALORIE COUNTS OF SORBETS  </P> <P> We're all children when it comes to ices, and sorbets are the ices of the '80s.  </P> <P> A sorbet is simply a sweetened liquid, often a fruit juice or puree, which is  frozen and then stirred or, better yet, churned to break up the ice crystals.  </P> <P> Lacking the calories and dairy content of ice creams or milk sherbets, these  coolers still manage to pull off the big trick -- fabulous flavors, great  textures and good looks.  </P> <P> Warm weather season is no time to be fiddling around with fussy desserts, and  these mouth-watering treats are easily and quickly prepared in any ice cream  machine. Look for luscious peaches or ripe berries for the fruit sorbets, as  simple recipes rely on using top-quality produce for flavor.  </P> <P> Sorbets may be served right from the machine or prepared ahead and frozen. To  prevent a quick thaw, just remember to have chilled glasses or a container  ready in the freezer. The frozen treats are all simple to prepare, and the  following techniques should help you churn batches of perfect sorbets  throughout the summer.  </P> <P>  -- Pureed fruits are generally too pulpy to dissolve sugar and are usually  sweetened by the addition of a sugar syrup (sugar dissolved in water).  </P> <P>  -- For all sorbets, adjust the sugar to taste, adding a little more than seems  necessary, as food tastes less sweet when frozen.  </P> <P>  -- The addition of a small amount of alcohol (usually wine or liqueur), which  cannot freeze solid, will prevent a sorbet from becoming too hard if frozen  overnight.  </P> <P>  -- For citrus sorbets, pulverizing the zest of the fruit with the sugar is a  great way to extract flavor from the skin.  </P></p>

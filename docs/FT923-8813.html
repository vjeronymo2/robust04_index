			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / UN wants observers in S Africa THE United Nations proposes to station 30 observers in South Africa to help bring about a peaceful transition to a multi-racial democracy, write Michael Littlejohns and Agencies in New York. The observer force was recommended by UN secretary general Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali yesterday in a report to the UN Security Council after the recent visit to South Africa by his envoy, Mr Cyrus Vance. Mr Boutros Ghali said the observers would draw on the experience of 10 temporary UN observers sent to monitor the two-day strike and protest rallies in South Africa this week. 'The observers would be stationed in agreed upon locations, in various parts of South Africa,' he said. They could, if necessary, be joined by personnel from the Commonwealth, the European Community and the Organisation of African States. Mr Boutros Ghali also recommended that 'an eminent and impartial person' - not necessarily a foreigner - be appointed to give impetus to new talks on constitutional arrangements in South Africa. The African National Congress has vowed not to resume constitutional talks until the government meets a number of demands, including measures to end violence, which has taken thousands of lives, especially in black townships. A South African prosecutor said yesterday he was examining new evidence of a state role in the 1985 killing of prominent black activist Matthew Goniwe, Reuter reports from Cape Town. Mr Michael Hodgen said a police team interviewed unidentified witnesses provided by newspapers including Johannesburg's Weekly Mail. The Weekly Mail said it had submitted evidence including the names of state hit-squad members responsible for the murder of Goniwe and colleagues on a remote highway.</p>

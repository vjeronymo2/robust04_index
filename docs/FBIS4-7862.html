			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by K.J.: "If the Sejm Accepts the President's Veto, </F> What Ace Does the Government Have Up Its Sleeve?"]    [Text] The Finance Ministry has announced that, if the  Sejm accepts the president's veto to the new popiwek [tax on  excessive wage increases] law, the government will submit a new  bill controlling salaries and wages. This time it would be  similar to the popiwek between 1990 and 1991--without any tax  allowances. It is possible that this bill would allow only one  method of establishing wages, in line with the index determined  by the government.    In the event that the president's veto is not rejected by  the  Sejm, the Finance Ministry is already preparing a bill that  would stop the automatic valorization of retirement and  disability pensions as well as unemployment benefits.  Therefore, the possibility should not be ruled out that, in  1994, a strictly fixed amount of money would be earmarked for  the increases in retirement and disability pensions, just as has  been done for the past three years with the salaries of the  budget sphere.    Asked what the government will do if the Sejm does not pass  the new popiwek law, Finance Deputy Minister Jan Kubik  responded: "Nothing." However, immediately after that, he  "admitted" the ministry's plans.    The ministry has received information that last Thursday and  Friday more money was taken out of banks for salary increases in  enterprises. This especially goes for the Silesian banks,  Director Zbigniew Boniuszko, of the Finance Ministry, said  yesterday. He fears that, if there is no law regulating this  problem, wages and salaries may increase in April by 18-20  percent.    The government was going to submit another proposal to the  deputies: Instead of adopting the new popiwek law once again,  they might try to amend it. Thus, the Sejm would have to  override the president's veto, pass this law, and, at the same  time, amend it.    What would this amendment consist of?    The government would abandon the famous Article 21--that is,  the right to extend the control of salaries and wages to private  companies. So far the government has justified this with the  necessity of "combating special threats to the financial balance  of the state." All the revenues derived from the new popiwek  would go to the state budget; at the beginning the government  wanted half of those revenues to be forwarded to the Agency for  Industrial Development (amendment of Article 31).    After yesterday's visit to the Finance Ministry, Prime  Minister Pawlak approved the amendment bill prepared by the  ministry.    However, from the standpoint of the law, it is not possible  to amend this law. A law that has not been announced in the  Legal Gazette cannot be amended.    It is possible, then, that the government will do the same  but in a different manner: If the Sejm does not override the  presidential veto, the government will submit another bill after  several days. The only difference between this bill and the  previous one would be that it would not allow for wage controls  in private companies and would classify the popiwek revenues as  the revenues of the state budget. The problem is that the new  law would have to be forwarded to the senate and then wait to be  signed by the president. Most certainly, then, it could not  come into effect on 1 April of this year.    "As a result of the government's statements that it is  preparing a new law, perhaps similar to the one we had in 1990,  enterprises will start paying additional money in panic," claims  Maciej Manicki, deputy chairman of the All-Polish Trade Unions  Agreement and chairman of the Sejm Extraordinary Committee for  the Pact on State Enterprise. The committee decided yesterday  that it would propose that the Sejm reject the new popiwek law.</p>

			<p><P> April 26, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> RAZOR BITS FOUND IN BABY FOOD IN ENGLAND; EXTORTION SUSPECTED  </P> <P> Police are investigating at least 16 incidents in which baby food bought at  grocery stores has contained glass shards, pieces of razor blades, thumbtacks  and caustic soda, news reports said today.  </P> <P> Scotland Yard said it was coordinating a nationwide police inquiry, but it  refused to give details.  </P> <P> The Daily Mail reported today that blackmailers apparently were trying to  extort money from supermarkets and food companies. It said several supermarket  chains and food manufacturers had received threats.  </P> <P> Manufacturers say their investigations have determined that products are not  being spiked during production and distribution.  </P> <P> One manufacturer, Heinz Co. Ltd., warned parents to be vigilant when feeding  their children canned and bottled food.  </P> <P> Spiked jars were first found last month in London and in the central cities of  Bedford and Leicester, news reports said. Further cases have since been  reported across southern England.  </P></p>

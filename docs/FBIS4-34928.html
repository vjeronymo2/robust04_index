			<p>BFN     [Text] BCV [Central Bank of Venezuela] President Antonio  Casas Gonzalez asserted last night that the government will  avoid controlling foreign exchanges "as much as possible" and  will maintain the current currency distribution mechanism.    We are monitoring the market closely because we want to  avoid  controlling foreign exchanges as much as possible, the BCV  president said at the Miraflores Palace.    Casas Gonzalez presided over a special BCV directorate  meeting last night. He later went to the Miraflores Palace and  met with President Rafael Caldera and Finance Minister Julio  Sosa Rodriguez for almost two hours.    We are following the same foreign exchange system we have  used in the past. It is difficult to combat speculation in a  situation of distrust such as the current situation. There are  rumors about situations that do not exist and there is  apprehension that the price of the dollar will rise. However,  the mechanism has worked and we believe it will continue to  work. We are constantly observing the market. You must have  noticed that today, the bolivar to dollar exchange rate reached  almost 200 bolivares to the dollar but it later dropped to 192  bolivares to the dollar. Thus, the mechanism is working, Casas  Gonzalez stated.    However, he warned that the situation could get difficult if  the campaign of rumors to discredit the banks, the issues  regarding Congress, the votes of censure, and things of this  type continue. Such actions create distrust and the system  cannot operate without trust, Casas Gonzalez added.    [Reporter] Could an economic emergency be declared?    [Casas] No, I don't think so.    [Reporter] Do the BCV and the government agree on the  monetary policy? The government stated that it is not  responsible for those decisions.    [Casas] It is our responsibility, but we have agreed up to  now.</p>

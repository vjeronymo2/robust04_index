			<p><P> August 24, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> BEAUTIFUL DREAMER;  </P> <P> MOVIES: 'AKIRA KUROSAWA'S DREAMS' OFFERS SOME OF THE LOVELIEST IMAGES EVER  CONCEIVED BY JAPAN'S GREATEST DIRECTOR.  </P> <P> "Akira Kurosawa's Dreams" (AMC Century 14 and Beverly Center Cineplex) contains  some of the most beautiful images ever conceived by the man who is widely  regarded as the world's greatest living director -- and it also has a couple of  the most ponderous moments of any of his 28 films. Even so, what works far  outweighs what doesn't, and this picture is an event for film lovers. Of all  the films that have played Los Angeles this year, only Theo Angelopoulos's "The  Travelling Players" can be mentioned in the same breath in regard to level of  aspiration and intensity of vision.  </P> <P> Inspired by actual dreams of the director, Kurosawa's film is composed of eight  episodes that express his abiding anti-war, anti-nuclear and pro-environment  sentiments. It is rich in the varied contemplations of a major 80-year-old  artist looking back and looking ahead with humor and concern. Kurosawa can  envision a hellish nuclear holocaust as well as a flowery meadow framed by a  rainbow, a ritualistic dance of life-size dolls performed on a tiered  mountainside, and one the most idyllic settings imaginable: a cluster of  watermills by a country stream. And when Kurosawa, whose alter ego (Akira  Terao) is identified only as "I," literally enters the world of Van Gogh's  paintings, the audience at the screening this reviewer attended broke into  applause.  </P> <P> Not surprisingly, in matters of style and technique, the film is sublime, with  Kurosawa working with such longtime associates as creative consultant Inoshiro  Honda (best known as the director of "Godzilla"), cinematographer Takao Saito,  lighting director Takeji Sano, art director Yoshiro Muraki and composer  Shinichiro Ikebe. George Lucas' Industrial Light and Magic contributed some  spectacular special effects. The most successful portions of the film are  marked by a lightness and ease that bring to mind the final films of Luis  Bunuel. "Akira Kurosawa's Dreams" opens and closes in pure enchantment. The  first two episodes are the dreams of childhood; the last, completing the  circle, of serene old age. According to ancient Japanese legend, a fox wedding  occurs when the sun shines on a rainy day. Such an event occurs in the dream of  the 5-year-old Kurosawa (Toshihiko Nakano) with consequences that are amusingly  scary but end in an image of awesome beauty.  </P> <P> In the second, little Akira (Mitsunori Isaki), now several years older, dreams  that his sisters' hina dolls, arranged in stately rows, have come alive as the  protesting spirits of the peach trees that Kurosawa's family has cut down in a  nearby orchard. The elaborate kimonos that the swaying, keening dolls wear have  been designed by Emi Wada, who won an Oscar for her similarly rich costumes for  Kurosawa's "Ran."  </P> <P> The light tone of these two dreams gives way to an eerie, ambiguous sequence in  which a mountain climber, one of four stranded in a snowstorm, is comforted by  a beautiful spirit -- but is she an angel of mercy or of death? In any event,  she is a sensual, seductive creature, alternately a figure of comfort and  menace and finally as ethereal as a scarf carried away by a gust of wind. The  film's tone grows much darker in a sequence so imaginative, so stunning in  effect, that it cannot be given away. It suffices to say that it has to do with  a heart-breaking incident of the supernatural experienced by a weary young  soldier who passes through a tunnel on his way home from a World War II  battlefield.  </P> <P> If only Kurosawa had been as inspired in remembering the tragedy of war when  warning us of nuclear peril. He creates a horrifying image of Mt. Fuji melting  in the wake of a nuclear accident, featuring some 2,000 extras, and focusing on  several principals who curse their fates in a didactic manner. The image is so  powerful the words aren't really necessary. But Kurosawa compounds the  heavy-handedness of his message, first expressed 35 years ago in his feature "I  Live in Fear," by following this nightmare with yet another. In this sequence,  his alter ego survives to meet a band of mutants, all of whom had been  government officials or financiers responsible for the nuclear folly. Kurosawa  might have gotten away with the first sequence, but the two side by side are  really heavy going.  </P> <P> Happily, these two sequences are preceded by his glorious homage to Van Gogh  and are followed by the warm and charming finale. In the first, Kurosawa's  alter ego enters the world of Van Gogh through one of his most famous  paintings, the 1888 "Drawbridge at Arles." Kurosawa plays with levels of  reality by making the actual world of Arles look like a series of Van Gogh  paintings and by having his alter ego scamper over the characteristic deep  ridges of the artist's paintings made so large as to make the Kurosawa figure  seem like the Incredible Shrinking Man in his final stages of diminution.  </P> <P> In the casting of Van Gogh, Kurosawa has made a truly daring choice: director  Martin Scorsese, who in Bertrand Tavernier's " 'Round Midnight" proved that  great actors great directors don't necessarily make. But Scorsese -- the entire  sequence is in English in deference to him -- is surprisingly effective,  especially in the dark intensity of his gaze.  </P> <P> For his final dream Kurosawa has cast an enduring icon of the Japanese cinema,  Chishu Ryu, as a 103-year-old man -- Ryu is actually a mere 86 -- who tends the  watermills in his beautiful village and tells his visitor of the importance of  living close to nature and the acceptance of the inevitability of death, which  should be a matter of celebration when the life has been lived long and well.  This is a warm coda of reconciliation, but it should not be taken as as a  farewell to the screen on the part of the director. For as "Akira Kurosawa's  Dreams" (rated PG; some scenes too intense for the very young) opens its run,  the master enters his ninth decade already shooting his next picture.  </P> <P> 'AKIRA KUROSAWA'S DREAMS'  </P> <P> A Warner Bros. presentation of an Akira Kurosawa USA production.

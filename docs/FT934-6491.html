			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Milan falls 2.7 per cent despite late recovery A number of separate issues coloured trading yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. MILAN was again under pressure early in the session as the lira fell to an all-time low against the D-mark, but the mood subsequently improved after the head of the Democratic Party of the Left reassured investors that turmoil in the financial markets was unjustified after the weekend local elections. The Comit index finished 14.12 or 2.7 per cent lower at 512.44, reflecing an improvement from the day's lowest levels after Mr Achille Occhetto pledged to back the government until the budget had been approved. Investors were heartened that he also stressed the importance of protecting savings, pushing through privatisations and keeping up the battle against inflation. Earlier in London, Mr Oliver Kamm and Mr William Cowan of James Capel commented that the equity market had been discounting investor concerns about political instability over the past few weeks and in the short term, investors might focus on the risk to the pace of administrative reform and fiscal consolidation posed by the decline of the centre parties. However, the macroeconomic and corporate earnings outlook for 1994 appeared favourable, while the support gained by the parties of the far left and far right was unlikely to be replicated in elections for a national government, they said. The telecommunications stocks were again marked down. Sip fell L56 to L2961 in volume of 27.7m shares and Stet was L9 lower at L3,419 in volume of 14m shares. FRANKFURT saw a day of contrasts with the DAX index moving between a high of 2,041 and a low of 2,015, before settling off 2.59 at 2,027.41. Some analysts commented that the market was now waiting for inflation data, due out either today or tomorrow before deciding its next direction. Mannesmann, which is due to release nine month data today, was down DM1.70 at DM359.00. Wella went against the trend, rising DM7 to DM835, after it reported a 5 per cent gain in pre-tax profits for the year to September. PARIS was upset by the profits warning from Elf Aquitaine and the shares of the oil group fell FFr15.80 or 3.5 per cent to FFr416.70. The CAC-40 index lost 11.14 to 2,071.47, after a high of 2,094 and a low of 2,059, on the last day of the account. The oil group, which is slated for privatisation next year, said that it expected 1993 profits to fall to around FFr1bn after FFr6.2bn in 1992. Its Elf Sanofi division went in the opposite direction, rising FFr3 to FFr928, in spite of also reducing its estimates for the full year. AMSTERDAM remained interested in KLM, the shares rising 30 cents to Fl 37.50, following the collapse of the Alcazar talks and news that the airline would continue to search for ways of reducing costs. The CBS Tendency index slipped 0.1 to 133.5, after a high of 134.3 and a low of 132.1. KNP BT, the paper and packaging group, was 20 cents higher at Fl 40.50 ahead of today's results. ZURICH edged higher, taking its lead from firmer Nestle and Roche shares, and the SMI index added 5.6 to 2,702.1. Nestle, SFr13 higher at SFr1,170, topped the active list ahead of its autumn news conference today. Alusuisse, with a presentation to analysts this morning, was SFr7 easier at SFr522. Roche rose SFr40 to SFr5,930 in active trade, recouping some of Monday's SFr140 slide. BBC closed SFr7 lower at SFr1,017 after ABB Asea Brown Boveri said it expected 1993 profits after financial items at the same level as in 1992. Holderbank eased SFr1 to SFr820 as it sold 200,000 shares to Union Bank, which announced a warrant bond on Holderbank shares with an exercise price of SFr823. STOCKHOLM was lower in nervous trade amid concern over higher debt market yields and a weaker crown. The Affarsvarlden index fell 11.3 to 1326.1. in turnover of SKr1.98bn. Asea did better than the overall bourse, its B share falling SKr3 to SKr549 on its nine-month results which proved in line with expectations.

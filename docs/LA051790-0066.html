			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A GLASS OF FRESH CREAM? THIS MUST BE A MENU FROM THE FORTIES;  </P> <P> COLLECTIBLES: RESTAURANT TRADE GROUP CATALOGUES FOOD TRENDS, PRICE HIKES AND  HISTORY A LA CARTE.  </P> <P> "Time ticks on since 1931 at the Tick Tock Toluca" said the menu from the North  Hollywood, Calif., restaurant, circa 1947. Time also ticks on at Chicago's Pump  Room, which listed shrimp cocktail on its menu in 1938 for 50 cents. (In April  at the Pump Room it was going for $9.50.)  </P> <P> But time doesn't change some things, like the all-American burger, albeit for  10 cents at Boxman's restaurant in Bloomington, Ind., 1930:  </P> <P> "Boxman's special hamburger grilled, with a slice of tomato, chopped olive,  lettuce and mayonnaise . . . a hamburger all dressed up and very popular."  </P> <P> These and other homilies, food trends, inflationary information and historical  tidbits are part of the National Restaurant Assn.'s menu collection, tucked in  a back room in the library of the trade group's headquarters in Washington.  </P> <P> While not the oldest or the largest of such anthologies, NRA's collection  consists of several hundred menus dating from the '30s to the '70s. There are  also about 3,000 from the last decade, gathered from the association's annual  menu contest.  </P> <P> The older part of the collection came from a variety of sources, but largely as  a donation by one woman about whom NRA knows little. Thus, it is not only a  cache of brittle paper and plastic covers that have lost their gloss, but the  leisure history of the mystery woman who made the donation.  </P> <P> Menu margins are scribbled with enthusiastic notes: At the Penn-Sheraton Hotel  in Pittsburgh in 1960, she wrote "delirious" next to the spare ribs Creole. In  1962, at the Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco, she ate in the Tonga Room "with  Dal Brown. Everything was wonderful, had so much fun. A panic. Loved it." (Dal  ordered the barbecued sparerib plate; she had the mushroom chicken, listed  under "special Tonga dishes.")  </P> <P> The period these menus represents was short and not so long ago. Nonetheless, a  lot has changed. Menus have evolved from simple lists of black type on white  paper to catchy, colorful texts. There was not much detail or description of  dishes then. Menu items were likely to be listed as "fried rabbit" or  "smothered chicken, country gravy," as at the Tick Tock Toluca.  </P> <P> The menu "started out as a bill of fare and became more and more a marketing  tool," said David Romm, assistant professor at the Cornell School of Hotel  Administration, where he teaches a class called "The Restaurant in Society."  </P> <P> In the 1930s restaurants didn't mean as much, Romm said. They "moved into  center stage" during the 1960s, and so the menu became a means of capturing  customers from the competition, he added.  </P> <P> What's more, many of the items on menus of the '30s and '40s are unseen  nowadays. Entree choices then were fleshed out by game dishes, frogs' legs and  organ meats. Society, after all, was far more agrarian, and nothing from the  farm was wasted. Americans were "eating everything in the pig except the oink,"  said Linda Smith, manager of library and information services at NRA. Head  cheese was common at nice restaurants, she added.  </P> <P> Sandwiches on the 1940 menu from Chicago's Marshall Field's department-store  restaurant, the Narcissus Fountain Room, were typical: sweetbread salad roll,  65 cents; minced tongue and horseradish, 25 cents; hot chicken giblet with  pickle, 35 cents.  </P> <P> There was also much more attention to sexy, slinky cocktails like pink ladies.  "All those drinks that Grace Kelly used to order in the movies," said Claire  Regan, NRA's nutritionist.  </P> <P> Many dishes were offered fried, and whole glasses of fresh cream appeared as a  beverage choice. At Chicago's Persian Dining Room in 1945, where the only  Persian items on the menu were "our very special Persian omelette" and "our  Persian chicken salad," the "health vegetable plate" came with Swedish  meatballs.  </P> <P> As a war measure to "make the nation strong," Regan said, in 1941 the federal  government required that all bread and rolls be enriched with B vitamins and  iron. Thus, Marshall Field's English Room offered "vitamin-B rolls."  </P> <P> Other signs of the war were reflected on menus in the '40s. Many noted that the  prices were at or below ceiling prices set by the Office of Price  Administration, and that a record of the ceiling prices was available for  inspection. OPA was established by the federal government in 1942 to set  rationing and price and rent controls for the wartime economy.  </P> <P> One restaurant, the New York-based White Turkey, made reference on its menu  that it had temporarily closed its Danbury, Conn., branch until the ban on  pleasure travel was lifted.  </P> <P> While the men dined on K rations, the vegetable of choice on mainland menus was  lima beans, the dessert of the decade was kadota figs and the drink was  Ovaltine.  </P> <P> In the '50s, game and organ meats were replaced with the ubiquitous half a  fried chicken. The vegetable of choice became garden peas, the salad was an  iceberg wedge with thousand island dressing and the misguided high-fat "diet  plate" of a hamburger patty, scoop of cottage cheese and peach half started  appearing often.  </P> <P> Figs were replaced by Jell-O with whipped cream, water ice or sherbet, even at  some of the more elegant restaurants. French dining rooms were likely to be  named things like "The House of Crepes Suzette," serving cherries jubilee and  peach flambe.  </P> <P> Then, in the 1960s, Jell-O took a side role to cheesecake and "French pastry."  French restaurant menus were large and cumbersome with fancy scroll, and  everything was either au gratin, au jus or had an accent aigu. (Le Manoir,  location unknown to NRA, served what it called a "minute steak grillee.") Les  escargots were invariably followed by "snails" in parentheses.  </P> <P> Glossy photographs of food started appearing on menus, like the ones at Mack  Eplen's Restaurant, otherwise known in Abilene, Texas, as the House of  Hospitality. You didn't have to visualize; you could see exactly what an order  of sirloin butt steak with a salad, baked potato, hot rolls, iceberg lettuce  and tomato slice would look like.  </P> <P> There's only one word for what appeared on menus in the next decade. "All you  need to know about the '70s," said Smith, is "quiche." Everything else was  turned into teriyaki. Cheeseburgers shed their orange American slabs in favor  of Monterey Jack or blue cheese.  </P> <P> Menus treated food as fun. The Twin Falls (Idaho) Chew-Chew restaurant menu was  shaped like a train. The Fogcutter's Restaurant (St. Petersburg, Fla.) menu was  shaped like a barrel. Menus were fashioned after newspapers with cartoon  drawings of pies, burgers and quiches. Words were purposely spelled  incorrectly: kaiser klub.  </P> <P> Some of the homilies that appeared on older menus may never be rivaled.  </P> <P> At Chancellor's Restaurant in Waynesboro, Miss., in 1950, the proprietor  offered this bit of culinary advice to describe the eatery's reason for serving  what it called "left hams":  </P> <P> "When a hog scratches his right side, he does a Charleston with his right foot.  That develops muscles. When he scratches his left side, he does a gentle shimmy  against a tree or post. Therefore, right hams are far more muscular and less  tender than those from the left side of the same hog."  </P> <P> Other restaurants sounded genuinely sincere in their efforts to please. The  fountain dessert was king in Bloomington, Ind., in 1930, so Boxman's made the  following menu offer:  </P> <P> "We respectfully suggest that you try your skill in making up a Dessert  Special. Perhaps you have wondered many times just what it would taste like if  so-and-so and so-and-so were put together in a dish. Our Fountain Dispenser  will get a great thrill and be delighted to make up this special dish for you.  Just give your service girl your formula!"  </P></p>

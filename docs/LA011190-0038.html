			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: STAGE  </P> <P> 'Miss Saigon' Seeks Broadway Home: The London musical "Miss Saigon" is expected  to be the next big blockbuster on Broadway, but it may not get there until the  spring of 1991 or later. The show, a modern "Madama Butterfly" that tells the  story of the last days of American involvement in the Vietnam War, was supposed  to get to New York this fall.  </P> <P> Following the smash success of his "Phantom of the Opera," producer Cameron  Mackintosh is having trouble finding a theater big enough to house his next  grand production, which includes a 40-member cast and a dramatic helicopter  landing scene. Mackintosh refuses to take any shortcuts. "I'm not going to put  'Miss Saigon' on in New York in any less of a way than it is appearing in  London," he said. The show is estimated to cost $9 million, which would make it  the most expensive in Broadway history.  </P></p>

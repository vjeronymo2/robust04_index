			<p><P> August 25, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> USX Restores Pay Cuts: The nation's No. 1 steelmaker said it is restoring pay  cuts and benefit reductions imposed on 5,500 white-collar workers during lean  times in the early 1980s. On Sept. 1, about 1,400 hourly non-union employees  will see a restoration of the 5% pay cut they took in 1983, a USX spokesman  said. Those non-union workers and 4,100 management employees will also regain  two paid holidays that were cut in 1986, increasing the paid holidays to nine.  </P></p>

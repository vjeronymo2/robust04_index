			<p><P> August 14, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> The gay president of the Fremont school board is facing a recall drive. The  Fremont Family Alliance won Alameda County approval to circulate petitions and  has until Jan. 10 to collect the signatures of at least 12,219 of Fremont's  81,495 registered voters in an effort to recall Robert Stipicevich. The  alliance contends that Stipicevich presents impressionable students with a role  model for homosexuality. Stipicevich suggested that the alliance is "a little  bit shady" because leaders of the group meet in private and are secretive about  membership.  </P></p>

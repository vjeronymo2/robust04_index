			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, April 5 (BTA) -- The Turkish parliamentary  delegation led by Grand National Assembly Speaker Husamettin  Cindoruk, which is visiting this country, this afternoon had a  20-minute meeting with President Zhelev. The Turkish MP's  yesterday arrived on an official visit at the invitation of the  Bulgarian Parliament. The question about the participation of  Turkish blue helmets in the UN peacekeeping forces in Bosnia was  not raised, President's foreign policy adviser Kamen Velichkov  said. The fact that this Turkish parliamentary delegation  comprises members of four political parties indicates that  good-neighbourliness was set the major principle of Turkey's  policy by a political consensus, Mr. Cindoruk reportedly told  President Zhelev. The two sides identified mutual interests in  attracting foreign investments in the region and particularly  for the construction of the regional infrastructure, Mr.  Velichkov also said. "The Black Sea Economic Cooperation was  mentioned along this line of reasoning," the president's adviser  said, answering a journalist's question.    Earlier in the afternoon the Turkish delegation met Deputy  Prime Minister Evgeni Matinchev, now sitting in for Prime  Minister Berov during the latter's sick leave. The talks  focused on the achievements of the military cooperation, control  of drug trafficking and organized crime, and mutual interests in  the construction of the east-west and north-south trunk roads.  "I availed myself of the occasion to stress the losses this  country is sustaining as a result of the Yugo-embargo and to  call on Turkey to help solve this problem in its capacity as a  member of international institutions," Mr. Matinchev said. The  acting prime minister also raised the question of Turkey's 2  million U.S. dollar liability to Bulgaria for the water supplied  last year. Mr. Matinchev said that the Turkish parliamentary  speaker apologized and explained the settlement was belated by  the bureaucratic machine in Turkey. He also pledged to address  the Turkish prime minister for a speedy solution of this problem.    This morning the Turkish guests held long meetings with the  Parliamentary National Security and Foreign Policy Committees.  Speaking to journalists after the meeting, the leaders of the  two committees said that the Bulgarian MP's raised the question  of the deployment of Turkish blue helmets in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  Both committees reiterated this country's stand in favour of  the Balkan countries' non-involvement in the conflict in former  Yugoslavia. Mr. Cindoruk said in response that he respects  Bulgaria's stance. "As to the Yugo-crisis, the two countries are  acting within the framework of the UN decisions, each one of  them taking its own stand," Mr. Cindoruk said. He once again  explained that it is not Turkish troops but Turkish blue helmets  that have been invited to join the UN peacekeeping forces in the  Yugo-conflict. Parliamentary National Security Committee  Chairman Nikolay Slatinski said that there were no serious  debates as to the Turkish blue helmets. "But what we can say is  that Turkey first asked to participate and only then was it  invited by the UN Security Council," Mr. Slatinski went on to  say. The National Security Committee and the Turkish guests  discussed some other issues, including the Rezovska River,  running along the Turkish-Bulgarian border, fishing in  territorial waters in the Black Sea and Bulgarian plots in  Turkey. MP's of this parliamentary committee voiced their  opinion that it was high time the rights of Bulgarian Muslims  were taken out of the Islamic Conference's agenda.</p>

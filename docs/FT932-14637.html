			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Steel hardens The continuing recovery of cyclical stocks was illustrated by the further advance in British Steel. The shares gained another 4 to 94 3/4 p, having touched 96p earlier in the day, as volume rose to a hefty 16m shares. This week's strong performance of British Steel began on Thursday after SG Warburg upgraded profit recommendations, and James Capel reiterated a buy recommendation. Both said the recent price increases are likely to hold and will thus prompt a recovery in the group's figures. Other brokers remain cautious but several are expected to turn positive in the next week or so.</p>

			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading STOCK index futures had a dull but volatile session as Tuesday's late talk of a cut in German interest rates faded, and the continued weakness of sterling led to the belief there would be no cut in UK base rates either, writes Joel Kibazo. The strong opening of December at 2,603, was quickly reversed by a strong bout of selling which soon dried up leaving the contract to go better. The advance to 2,618 seen around 10am was surrendered as worries over the economic outlook gained the upper hand, and December traded sideways for most of the rest of the session with the early dullness in the other European markets also taking its toll. The late burst of traders covering positions led to a reversal in the fortunes of December sending it sharply forward on a squeeze. It closed at 2,617, down 9 on its previous session and about 25 points ahead of its fair value premium to cash of about 40. Turnover was poor at 7,498 lots. Traded options were dull with total turnover reaching a mere 21,301 contracts, well below the market's 30,000 break even level, with the FT-SE 100 option trading 7,253 contracts. ICI was the most actively dealt stock option with a day's total of 1,010 lots.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The survey responses were used to determine which PHAs surveyed have vacancy problems and the nature of their problems. Eligibility and final decisions on funding will be based on submitted applications, including the vacancy reduction plans, the number of eligible units, and the assessments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Funding should not be on a ``first-come, first-served'' basis, which rewards those able to act the quickest, but should be awarded using a more traditional competitive approach. Criteria that should be used to make awards include: PHA capacity and ability to use the funds effectively and likelihood that additional funds will improve vacancy situation. Severely distressed properties should not be a priority, and funding should be targeted for entire developments, rather than scattered units. (PHADA)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Because the Department would like to fund all PHAs that meet the requirements of the NOFA, it has decided not to include the first-come, first-served limitation. The immediate goal of the Department is to promote the occupancy of the greatest number of units; the problems of severely distressed developments are targeted more directly through other programs and are not priorities of the vacancy reduction program. Similarly, because of funding limitations, the Department believes the program purposes will be promoted best by targeting the elimination of vacant units, rather than the upgrading of entire developments that include occupied units.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Under some circumstances, a PHA may be made eligible for program funds, but restricted in spending the funds until an assessment is performed. If this assessment is not done within 45 days of the fund award, then the PHA should be allowed to expend the funds. (PHADA, CHA)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Department has already conducted assessments of known eligible PHAs and will complete all assessments in advance of funding decisions. In order to ensure fairness, in the NOFA published elsewhere in today's  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , the Department has provided that a PHA for which an assessment has not been conducted but that considers itself eligible under the NOFA, should notify the Department within 15 days of its request for an immediate assessment. In addition, when an approvable plan submitted in response to the NOFA needs improvement or supplementation, the Department will assist the PHA in revising its plan prior to the execution of the amendment to the Annual Contributions Contract (ACC). Because very few, if any, eligible PHAs will not have had assessments by today's publication of the NOFA, the Department believes that all assessments will be completed on a timely basis in this funding cycle.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Activities that will decrease unit turnover in occupied units (e.g., replacement of appliances) also should be considered eligible for funding under this program. (CHA)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Although the Department recognizes the relationship between turnover and vacancy rates and is sympathetic to this reasonable suggestion, current funding for the vacancy reduction program is limited. Therefore, the Department intends to target funding of unit improvements for currently vacant units or units to become vacant for reconfiguration purposes, where reconfiguration is necessary to reduce the current number of vacancies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Funding should be guaranteed for a minimum of a three-year period following HUD approval of a five-year vacancy reduction plan, subject to the PHA's continued progress on and adherence to its vacancy reduction plan. (CHA, MCHA)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Department cannot guarantee funds that have not been appropriated by Congress. Therefore, a PHA's five-year plan should reflect a realistic projection of the actions that can be taken with available or potential resources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) If funded activities require compliance with Housing Quality Standards, the amount of funds may not be sufficient to address problems in areas outside the unit (e.g., hallways, stairways, fire protection systems). HQS standards should apply only to unit interiors. (CHA)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Department recognizes that current funding available under the Vacancy Reduction Program will not be sufficient to address all problems areas relating to excess vacancies, and it expects to be guided in its funding decisions by the assessment team reports. The vacancy reduction plans and the recommendations of the assessment teams should include all work inside the units, in the hallways, in common areas, on the site, and to the exterior of the buildings necessary to make the units marketable; providing plans and funding for only the interiors of vacant units may not make those units marketable. Individual work items funded under this program must comply with modernization standards and must result in the targeted unit meeting the HQS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (9) Program funds should not be directed at PHAs that have vacancy problems due primarily to marketing problems or lack of demand. (CHA)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Department agrees that the limited program funds should be focused on those PHAs whose vacancy situations can actually be improved by additional funding. This factor is accounted for in &sect;968.413(d)(2) of the rule (``extent to which the proposed activities will improve the PHA's vacancy problem'') and in the definition of ``eligible unit'' set out in the NOFA published elsewhere in today's  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Sanctions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the proposed rule, the Department reported that, at this time, it does not intend to implement section 14(p)(3) of the statute, which provides sanctions for the failure to make progress under a plan. However, commenters were invited to submit suggestions on how this portion of the statute could be implemented in the future. Several commenters submitted remarks on this aspect of the current statutory program, as follows: (1) If a withholding action seems likely after 18 months, an assessment team should be sent to the PHA to perform a review and prepare a report. (PHADA) (2) If there is withholding, consideration should be given to forcing a receiver to be used so that the funds can be used. (PHADA, CHA) (3) Withholding of subsidy because of a failure to make progress is contrary to the approach of rewarding PHAs for solving problems.

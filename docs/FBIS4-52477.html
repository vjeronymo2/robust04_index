			<p>BFN     [Text] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MFA] has welcomed  the U.S. State Department's clarification that Washington has  not yet taken a stand on Singapore's bid to host the first World  Trade Organization [WTO] conference. A Ministry spokesman said  this in response to queries from the News Five. Singapore had  expressed regret yesterday after U.S. Trade Representative  Mickey Kantor said that the WTO meeting ought to be held  elsewhere. A State Department spokesman said the U.S. had no  opinion on whether Singapore should host the conference and that  Mr. Kantor's comments were his own. The MFA spokesman stressed  that the Republic's proposal to host the conference still  stands. WTO members are to decide on the venue for the  conference.</p>

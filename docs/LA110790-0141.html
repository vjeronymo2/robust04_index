			<p><P> November 7, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DANA PARSONS: ROCKY MOUNTAIN LOW: A BAD FEELING IS GROWING AGAIN  </P> <P> I'm not panicking, I'm not panicking, I'm not panicking.  </P> <P> But as Yogi Berra once said, it's deja vu all over again.  </P> <P> In the late '70s, Denver vibrated with promise. To Midwest and East Coast  transplants, it offered the best of both worlds -- a sophisticated center of  high-rises and arts centers flanked by some of the most beautiful scenery  Mother Nature ever laid on anybody.  </P> <P> During the '70s and early '80s, the developers couldn't rebuild downtown Denver  or Colorado fast enough. At one point, with the building boom in full stride, a  national publication took a look at downtown Denver construction and suggested  that the state bird must be the 40-story crane.  </P> <P> If city life wasn't for you, a growing suburbia ringed Denver where you could  also buy a house and make a bundle in a short time. And whether you lived in  city or suburb, you could quite possibly stand in your yard and get misty-eyed  gazing at the snow-capped Rocky Mountains.  </P> <P> Baby, if it wasn't paradise, it was close enough.  </P> <P> Like other people who moved to Colorado in the late '70s, I thought I'd caught  a ride on a golden goose. I bought a house in 1978 and sold it five years later  for a 70% profit. While there had been talk of Denver historically being a  boom-and-bust town, everyone thought it would be different this time -- that  this time, Denver was on an ever-ascending path. Number one with a bullet.  </P> <P> The euphoria went beyond real estate profits. There was a headiness that was  much written about and talked about -- the notion that we were truly blessed to  be living in Denver in the late 1970s, as if some kind of anointing had  occurred and that by the grace of God we had been selected as the chosen  people.  </P> <P> The front-page logo in the Denver Post -- " 'Tis a privilege to live in  Colorado." -- was taken as gospel.  </P> <P> They don't talk like that in Denver any more. The 1980s post-mortem is that  Denver was drastically overbuilt, with commercial office vacancies now at a  reported 33%. A friend of mine owes $90,000 on a house now valued at $79,000.  One of the more vivid legacies of downtown is that of a new 37-floor office  building that was nearly vacant for more than a year after it opened, with its  most visible tenant being the city Planning Department.  </P> <P> During the '80s, many people who had a Rocky Mountain high left and took their  dreams with them. When I went back last May to visit friends, I drove to my old  neighborhood. There was a HUD sign on my townhouse.  </P> <P> Sigh.  </P> <P> Thank you for indulging me this burst of personal reminiscence. It was sparked  a few weeks ago by a Mission Viejo woman who stood before the County Planning  Commission and spoke in favor of a large residential development in South  County. Before she did, however, she said that she and other friends felt lucky  to live in Orange County and that while she wished people would stop pouring  in, she knew that was unrealistic.  </P> <P> I can't tell you how many conversations I had like that 15 years ago. I see the  same strut here that Denver once had, the same sense that we can be bruised but  never broken.  </P> <P> But recent reports of ill winds blowing aren't comforting. Foreclosures and  bankruptcies are rising; corporate earnings and home sales are falling.  </P> <P> And we keep building. And as we do, from Santiago Canyon to the Irvine coast,  from the ridgelines of Laguna Niguel to Seal Beach, people are asking why. A  planning commissioner recently chided a developer for seeking approval for a  large project at such a perilous economic time. He then went ahead and voted  for the project.  </P> <P> I'm no economic expert, and this soliloquy isn't to suggest that Orange County  could go the way of Denver. People much smarter than I say Orange County is  nowhere near as overbuilt as other places in the country that bottomed out in  the '80s.  </P> <P> They're probably right. But I can't shake these visions of golden geese and  see-through office buildings and paradises with boards on the windows.  </P> <P> I think from time to time about the magic that was Colorado in the late '70s.  In his song "Rocky Mountain High," which probably lured more people to Colorado  in the mid-1970s than anything the state tourism industry ever did, John Denver  wrote about his love for the beauty of Colorado and his fear for its future.  </P> <P> Though his life is filled with wonder  </P> <P> His heart still knows some fear  </P> <P> Of the simple things he cannot comprehend  </P> <P> Why they try to tear the mountains down to bring in a couple more  </P> <P> More people, more scars upon the land.  </P> <P> Colorado was a special place in 1977. I know many people have that same feeling  today about Orange County.  </P> <P> And I'm not panicking, I'm not panicking, I'm not panicking.  </P></p>

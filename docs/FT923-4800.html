			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / Rolls-Royce fails to reach forecasts: Pressure mounts on Britain's dollar-sensitive companies as US currency weakens THE weak dollar depressed Rolls-Royce's first-half profits, already under pressure from the slump in the commercial airline industry and a shrinking defence market. Although the UK aero-engine and industrial power group's first-half pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 20m from Pounds 11m the previous year, this was at the bottom end of City forecasts of between Pounds 25m and Pounds 40m. The shares fell 4p yesterday to close at 128p in a strong market. The company said the weak dollar had reduced profits by about Pounds 10m compared with last year. Sir Ralph Robins, chief executive who succeeds Lord Tombs as chairman next month, said the company had a dollar exposure of between 22 per cent and 23 per cent of turnover. The weaker dollar is benefitting Rolls-Royce's two principal US rivals, General Electric and Pratt &amp; Whitney. Sir Ralph said the company would pursue its drive to improve efficiency leading to further job cuts in the second half. The workforce has been cut by about 9,000 people during the past 18 months and between 800 and 1,800 more cuts are expected in the second half of this year. Restructuring charges totalled Pounds 14m in the first half. The company's confidence in the long-term is reflected in the decision to maintain its interim dividend unchanged at 2.55p but it is uncovered by earnings of 0.9p per share. Lord Tombs said the company was encouraged by its strong order books of Pounds 6.7bn. First-half turnover declined 2 per cent to Pounds 1.638bn from Pounds 1.67bn. Aerospace activities reported a Pounds 2m profit compared with a Pounds 10m loss last year with turnover dipping to Pounds 924m from Pounds 987m. The industrial power business reported higher profits of Pounds 28m against Pounds 26m with sales rising to Pounds 714m from Pounds 683m. Company-funded research and development investments was Pounds 109m in the first half, down from Pounds 118m a year ago. Sir Ralph said the civil airline business had strong growth potential, but a recovery would hinge on a world economic turnaround. The company was continuing to shrink its defence business but maintaining the capability to take advantage of a sudden pick-up. Sir Ralph was optimistic Saudi Arabia would go ahead with its order of between Pounds 4bn and Pounds 5bn for Tornado and Hawk aircraft. Lex Page 20</p>

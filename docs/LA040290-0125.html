			<p><P> April 2, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> SENATOR SINGER'S STRAIGHT MAN  </P> <P> Laid-back singer Jimmy Buffett thought Sen. Bob Graham (D-Fla.), looked too  formal over the weekend at a Capitol Hill meeting with 125 young leaders from  Florida. So Buffett, a friend of the senator who calls himself "the  non-conformist in Bob Graham's life," pulled out a pair of scissors and snipped  off the tie, which was decorated with small Florida emblems. Buffett also spoke  seriously, telling the crowd to get involved in their communities and recalling  how Graham had first inspired his work to save the Florida manatee.  </P></p>

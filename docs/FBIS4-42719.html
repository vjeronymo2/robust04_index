			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Eric Dupin: "Opinion Polls: Fragmented and as </F> Yet Undecided Voters"]    [Text] While publicizing new polls is now forbidden, the  latest surveys highlight two trends: There could be a record  number of abstentions and the electorate is fragmented due to  the high number of lists -- a situation that does nothing to  help [Socialist Party Secretary General] Michel Rocard.    The population has hardly been gripped by the European  election campaign. Voting intentions have mostly remained  stable since April. A week before the election, voters remain  uninterested and relatively undecided. This is probably the  reason behind the differences in the forecasts published this  week by the various polling institutes. This also means that  these last polls -- any new poll is forbidden as of yesterday --  do not necessarily reflect the results of the 12 June election.  Surprises are always possible in a 20-list election which  should be affected by a high abstention rate. Not to mention  the fact that many voters (40 percent according to the latest  IFOP [French Public Opinion Institute] survey) may change their  mind by election day.    According to SOFRES [French Public Opinion Polling Company],  the participation rate would be 53 percent. However, no one  denies the possibility that the record abstention figure  registered for a European election may be broken on 12 June: In  1989, the participation rate was 49.35 of registered voters.  Indeed, the proportion of respondents who stated they were  interested in the European election is lower than it was five  years ago (54 percent as compared to 56 percent). As usual,  potential abstentions are found mainly within younger and less  affluent stratas of the population.    Only one list seems to be benefiting from any real campaign  momentum: that of Philippe de Villiers ["The Other Europe,"  anti-Maastricht list]. Voting intentions in its favor increased  relatively steadily, from 4 or 5 percent in April to 7 percent  in the latest BVA [Brulle Ville Associates] survey, 8.5 percent  in the SOFRES poll, and even 10 percent in the IFOP survey.  (Footnote 1) (BVA-France/Europe-1 survey from 1 to 3 June among  1,514 respondents. IFOP/JOURNAL DU DIMANCHE survey on 2 and 3  June among 818 respondents. SOFRES/TF-1 survey on 2 and 3 June  among 1,000 respondents.) Mr. de Villiers' list is expected to  pass easily the 5-percent threshold for entry into the European  Parliament. It has succeeded in winning over many right-wing  voters who opposed the Maastricht Treaty. It achieves its best  results among older and nonsalaried RPR [Rally for the Republic]  voters. Its supporters seem to be determined enough to confirm  their voting intention on election day.    Those who should be smiling on the evening of 12 June may  even include Bernard Tapie ["Radical Energy," leftist list].  The latest polls credit him with 8 percent (BVA), 8,5 percent  (SOFRES), or 9 percent (IFOP) of voting intentions. His MRG  [Left Radical Movement] list no longer seems to be slipping, as  was the case in late May. Mr. Tapie may benefit from his debate  with [National Front leader] Jean-Marie Le Pen, in which he  mostly had the upper hand. However, he may be among the main  victims of a high abstention rate, since his electorate (young  and blue collar workers) encompasses those categories that are  the most likely to abstain. Competition from the "Sarajevo"  list may also rob him of a few percentage points.    The politician that stands to lose the most in this European  election is Michel Rocard. Hindered by the presence of the  Tapie and Chevenement ["Alternative Policy"] lists, his  Socialist list is likely to fare particularly badly if polls are  anything to go by: 14 percent (IFOP), 15 percent (CSA)  [expansion unknown], 16 percent (BVA), or 16.5 percent (SOFRES).  (These statistics, as those mentioned above, take into account  the "Sarajevo" list led by Leon Schwartzenberg [which was  withdrawn last week].) The Socialist Party is not even certain  to improve on its disastrous result of the March 1993  parliamentary election (17.6 percent of votes). Truth be told,  European elections have always been a tough test for the  Socialists.    The other "major list" headed by Dominique Baudis  [majority's  "Union" list] is less affected by electorate fragmentation.  With 29 percent (SOFRES), 32 percent (IFOP), and 33 percent  (BVA) of voting intentions, it falls short of the 39 percent of  votes won by the UDF [French Democratic Union]-RPR coalition in  the latest parliamentary election. It has been the main victim  of the increasing success of Philippe de Villiers' list. At the  outset of the campaign, some polling institutes saw Mr. Baudis'  list pull in over 35 percent of votes. The latest polls give  results perilously close to those of the list headed by Valery  Giscard d'Estaing in 1989 (28.8 percent). And anything below 33  percent would be a failure for the majority, which a year ago  managed to conquer about four seats out of five in the National  Assembly.    Polls predict a relatively stable showing for the National  Front. Anticipated results for Jean-Marie Le Pen's list are  highly consistent: 10 percent (BVA) or 11 percent (SOFRES and  IFOP) of voting intentions. The far Right would thus achieve  results roughly similar to those of the 1989 European election  (11.8 percent). The National Front's declining influence in the  media does not prevent it from benefiting from the continued  support of an electorate whose loyalty it managed to secure.  The Communist list led by Francis Wurtz is credited with 5.5  percent (IFOP), 6.5 percent (SOFRES), or 7 percent (BVA) of  voting intentions. The French Communist Party [PCF] would thus  do no better than in the 1989 European election, when its list  was headed by Philippe Herzog (7.7 percent of votes). The  European election has traditionally been a difficult one for the  Communists, who suffer, among other things, from abstention  among the working classes. Polls indicate that the PCF is in an  electoral stagnation phase, if not in one of decline.    Jean-Pierre Chevenement may be in for a nasty shock on  Sunday. With 2 percent (BVA), 2.5 percent (IFOP), and 3.5  percent (SOFRES) of voting intentions, his list is unlikely to  clear the critical 5 percent mark. Moreover, voters attracted  to this list are highly likely to change their mind. Mr.  Chevenement cannot seem to attract "left-wing grumblers" the way  Mr. de Villiers does "right-wing rebels."    As for the Greens [list led by Marie-Anne Isler-Beguin],  their position is just as serious. Credited with 1.5 percent  (BVA), 2 percent (IFOP), or 3 percent (SOFRES), they are likely  to suffer a veritable electoral rout. In 1989, they scored 10.6  percent of votes! They may even be humiliated by Brice  Lalonde's ["Ecology Generation") list: Voting intentions for it  are 2.5 percent (BVA) and 3 percent (SOFRES), but also 5 percent  (IFOP). The environmentalist movement as a whole is likely to  pay for its divisions by being kicked out of the European  Parliament.    Last is the unknown quantity that is the "Sarajevo" list.  The about-face of its initiators complicate the job for  pollsters. The latest surveys give 2 percent (IFOP), 3 percent  (SOFRES), and 3.5 percent (BVA) of voting intentions to the list  led by Leon Schwartzenberg. There is a possibility that it may  fare less well than the list led by Andre Goustat ("Hunting,  Fishing, Nature, and Tradition" list], which is credited with 2  percent (IFOP) to 2.5 percent (BVA and SOFRES) of voting  intentions.</p>

			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Mongolian president heads for easy victory MONGOLIA'S President Punsalmaagiyn Ochirbat was heading yesterday for an easy re-election victory which was also a defeat for the ruling ex-communist party that dumped him as its candidate, Reuter reports from Ulan Bator. Preliminary official results from the election on Sunday, Mongolia's first direct presidential poll, showed Mr Ochirbat with a 20-point lead over his challenger, Mr Lodongiyn Tudev, the conservative editor. With about 60 per cent of the votes counted, Mr Ochirbat is leading with 58.3 per cent of the total, while Mr Tudev has 38.1. The remaining votes were invalid. The results have been finalised in nine out of 18 provinces and in the two biggest cities. Unofficial tallies kept by the democratic coalition that backs the president show Mr Ochirbat has won the third largest city and three other provinces by large margins as well. Mr Ochirbat's win will be a grave embarrassment for the Mongolian People's Revolutionary party (MPRP), which controls the government and parliament. The party, which ran Mongolia as a Soviet satellite for almost seven decades, dumped Mr Ochirbat in favour of Mr Tudev in April.</p>

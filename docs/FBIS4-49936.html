			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Yu Yingrui (0151 3841 3843)] </F>   [Text] Xiamen, 21 Apr (XINHUA) -- At the national  conference on market and commodity circulation, which just ended  in Xiamen, participants called for establishing a new regulatory  and control system by enacting new regulatory and control rules  and employing new regulatory and control mechanisms in line with  the principle of a market economy. They also called for proper  regulation and control of such important commodities as grain,  cotton, edible oil, sugar, meat, vegetables, chemical  fertilizer, steel products, and petroleum products, which have a  bearing on people's lives and economic development.    Wang Yiping, a responsible person of the State Economics and  Trade Commission, said: Regulating and controlling market  operations is an important part of the operation of the economy  as a whole and is crucial to ensuring steady economic  development and the smooth progress of reform in all areas. As  the majority of commodities have been decontrolled, in dealing  with major problems that have emerged and with possible major  problems that may emerge in the operation of markets, it is  necessary to regulate and control market prices by applying  economic means and monetary policies and guide market depand so  as to achieve a balance between supply and demand.    Wang Yiping said: In establishing new regulatory and control  rules and regulations under the present circumstances, first, we  should establish a national reserve system and a local reserve  system. The central reserve system's main task is regulating  and controlling social supply and demand and regulating and  controlling market problems that will affect the situation as a  whole; the local reserve system's main task is regulating and  controlling the operation of markets in localities to ensure  market stability there. Second, we should establish a system of  risk funds for important commodities. The central authorities  have studied and established a system of risk funds for grain  and is planning to establish risk funds for meat, vegetables,  and other nonstaple food. Some localities have established  their own risk funds. After commodities are decontrolled,  production will be protected and market regulation and control  will be flexible and effective only if a system of risk funds is  established. Third, price regulation and control should be  conducted by making full use of international and domestic  markets, with emphasis on coordinating import-export policies.  Following the elimination of the dual-track system for foreign  exchange, the reform of the foreign trade system, and the  connection between the international and domestic markets,  imports and exports are playing an increasingly stronger  influence on the operation of markets. It is necessary to  establish a unified coordinating system for policies on the  import and export of important commodities and means of  production, and to coordinate, in accordance with changes in the  international and domestic markets, the application of customs  tariffs and value-added taxes as well as necessary nontariff  policies and measures, and to promptly readjust the  specifications and quantity of import and export commodities, so  as to promote the balanced and coordinated development of the  international and domestic markets. Fourth, we should establish  a market monitoring system to monitor the production, marketing,  and stocks of important commodities and means of production, as  well as to monitor changes in their prices, and also establish a  comprehensive information forecasting and monitoring network  that can provide feedback flexibly. Through such a system and  network we can do quantitative analysis on a regular basis,  promptly discover market problems suggesting a new development,  and put forward corresponding regulatory and control measures or  suggestions. In this way, market regulation and control we be  carried out promptly, accurately, and effectively.</p>

			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets: S Africa climbs 1.4 per cent Futures-related buying and improved foreign demand helped Johannesburg climb 1.4 per cent, although a volatile gold price and mild profit-taking blunted the advance. The overall index added 77 at 5,721, industrials 64 at 6,709 and golds 46, or 2.3 per cent, at 2,065. De Beers rose R2.50 to a closing high of R117.50 and Anglos were R6 up at R245. Argus Newspapers was untraded as it made its market debut: the gap between a bid price of R10 and sellers appearing at R15 was said to reflect uncertainty on future performance.</p>

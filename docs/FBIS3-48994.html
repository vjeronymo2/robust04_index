According to Mr. Velichkov, Dr. Zhelev's  message manifests Bulgaria's definite support for the democratic  forces and reforms in Russia. He said that Dr. Zhelev has shown  the way in which Bulgaria, reckoning with its national  interests, is looking for a place and foreign political  guarantees within NATO without confronting Russia.</p>

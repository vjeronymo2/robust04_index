			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Survey of International Legal Services (3): Marriages of convenience - A look at cross-border corporate joint ventures Like marriages of convenience, joint ventures owe more to the parties' perception of the relationships' worldly benefits than to more altruistic motives. But while joint ventures are of increasing importance in the European Union for sound business reasons, they also involve a difficult balancing act for regulators - especially for the EU, as it seeks to reconcile its need to achieve the single market with its desire to maintain effective EU competition. Despite the recession, the number of 1991-1992 joint ventures declined more slowly than takeovers and mergers in the EU. They also have a predominantly cross-border character. Community and international operations accounted for 72 per cent of total joint ventures in 1991-1992. French firms predominated in joint venture activity, followed by Germany and then UK companies - but they are also a popular method by which Japanese and US firms increase their growth in Europe. Overall, the national, EU and international joint ventures across 12 industry sectors doubled in the five years to 1990. Increases in the chemical, electrical and automotive industries were most pronounced. Political factors have stimulated international trading. 'The advent of the EU single market and the opening up of the former Soviet Union, China and Eastern Europe to western and other investors, have contributed to the recent increase in cross-border joint ventures,' says Jim Wheaton of Clifford Chance, the London law firm. But, given heightened trading opportunities, what is making joint ventures so alluring? 'A common reason for engaging in joint ventures is to enter new markets,' Mr Wheaton says, 'and the indications are that this trend is rapidly increasing.' Local knowledge, facilities, labour and customers can be provided through local venture partners. 'Making a product in your own market and sending it out into the world is increasingly under challenge,' says Brian Woods-Scawen, corporate finance partner of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, accountants. 'Companies need to understand markets from the inside, and joint ventures also permit greater control than employing local agents and distributors.' Accelerated technological change has often forced huge investment in research and development. Organisational size has become critical in corporate competitiveness, and so has the need for rationalisation and restructuring. Fears of protectionism also prompt local alliances. Now, even the biggest companies may lack time and talent for solo efforts. Joint efforts also reduce risk. 'Administratively, joint ventures are more complicated, but constraints in time, money, manpower and knowledge are all factors in considering joint ventures,' says Wolfgang Schneider, assistant general counsel at Ford Europe. Ford's alliances cover a spectrum of different aspects of the business, from the production of components to the manufacture of a whole vehicle. 'Joint ventures are usually prompted by numerous factors, but the percentage of each factor varies with each case,' says Mr Woods-Scawen, 'and understanding these reasons and choice of partner is often more important than the precise structure.' Despite the popularity of joint ventures, in the EU there are attendant regulatory hurdles involving competition law. The EU's competition policy is central to its aims, but as the EU is keen to foster efficiency gains in EU industry, the past four years have seen an improvement in regulatory treatment in the area. Despite the level of merger activity, it was only with the Merger Regulation of 1989 that specific EU merger control appeared. Mergers exceeding threshold amounts of corporate turnovers are subject to compulsory prenotification, but notifications must be dealt with rapidly and under the 'one-stop shop' principle. Qualifying mergers are considered at EU level and do not usually involve national authorities. The European Commission must decide within a month if the transaction is acceptable. If it gives rise to serious doubts about its competitive effect, it will be subject to a a detailed investigation for up to four months. The record of approvals, however, is good. About 90 per cent of transactions are approved at the first stage, after which they may be approved subject to conditions. Aligned to the merger policy, and closely affected by it, is EU policy on joint ventures. EU competition law, however, differentiates between concentrative and co-operative joint ventures. If the venture is concentrative and threshold provisions of the Merger Regulation are met, the venture must be notified under the Merger Regulation - and attracts the one-stop treatment. Co-operative joint ventures are less fortunate. Outside the scope of the Merger Regulation they are assessed under the Rome Treaty rules on anti-competitive agreements and abuse of monopoly power. The EU's jurisdiction is not exclusive, and transactions may be examined as well by relevant national authorities - a time-consuming process with uncertain results. 'There is a crucial difference of treatment of the two forms of joint venture,' says Michael Reynolds of Allen &amp; Overy's Brussels office, 'and it is complicated by the fact that joint ventures take many forms.' Jointly owned companies are the most popular. But partners may only put part of their businesses into a new entity, contributions may be of a different nature, and many also take place between traditional rivals. A venture is considered concentrative if it performs, on a lasting basis, all the functions of an autonomous economic entity. It is considered co-operative in nature if it does not constitute such an entity - or if, although it does constitute such an entity, it gives rise to co-ordination of competitive behaviour by the parents in relation to each other or in relation to the joint venture. Jim Wheaton says: 'Leave parents with some involvement in the market, even downstream or upstream, and there is a risk that there will be some restraint on competition between parents or that there will be an impact on third parties.' It was the level of joint venture activity which made EU authorities reassess their procedures. 'The success of the EU Merger Regulation highlighted the failure of the commission to set up a satisfactory mechanism to appraise co-operative joint ventures, Mr Wheaton adds. Now the EC has improved its treatment of these alliances; from January 1993 the commission has been obliged to indicate - within two months of a co-operative venture notification - whether it believes the venture is compatible with EU competition laws or gives rise to serious doubts, and requires further examination. The EC's decision, however, is not binding as it is in relation to mergers. Nonetheless, at national level, little progress is being made. Clearance is needed under the competition laws of individual member states for co-operative joint ventures. Because member states laws differ, applications need to be tailored to their individual requirements. National rules on when these laws apply also vary; in some, it is necessary to have a party with an office in the state but in others sales only are required. National authorities, experts say, can be tougher than the EC, as they are looking at their own national markets rather than at the EU or the international picture. The necessity for national appraisal, Michael Reynolds says, 'is often a tortuous, fairly unpredictable route. One national authority alone can hold you up.' Led by the OECD, there is some talk of the need to harmonise national rules, but little progress is apparent. However, those states which have not had competition laws until recently, such as Italy and Spain, have modelled their laws on EU laws. But Germany and the UK have long had quite distinct competition laws. Attempts to harmonise them may prove difficult. While the distinction between co-operative and concentrative joint ventures is often a fine one, differences in regulatory treatment remain significant. But experts claim there is scope for structuring deals to ensure that they are within the merger provisions - so the earlier the advice is sought, the better. The setting up of a jointly owned company with its own finance and sales force, making it an autonomous entity so that the parents withdraw permanently from the market, is akin to merger - and unlikely to restrain competition between parents. A third party can be introduced to ensure that the deal meets merger control thresholds. 'Clients are often willing to alter the commercial structure to some extent to get different regulatory treatment,' says Mr Reynolds. Still, companies understand the remaining hazards of the present regimes. 'The EU authorities have made an appreciable effort, involving self-imposed disciplines, to improve the treatment of mergers and joint ventures,' says Wolfgang Schneider of Ford. But he believes an even clearer framework could be sought.  ------------------------------------------------------------- BIG INDUSTRIAL JOINT VENTURES (NATIONAL/EU/INTER'NTL)  ------------------------------------------------------------- Sector           1986   1987   1988   1989   1990 Electrical         19     21     20     29     23 Chemical           23     14     24     28     37 Vehicles            4      4      6      7     22 12 sectors         81     90    111    129    156  ------------------------------------------------------------- Source: EU statistics  -------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Local Public Document Room location: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Maud Preston Palenske Memorial Library, 500 Market Street, St. Joseph, Michigan 49085.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Attorney for licensee: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Gerald Charnoff, Esq., Shaw, Pittman, Potts and Trowbridge, 2300 N Street, NW, Washington, DC 20037.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> NRC Project Director: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Ledyard B.

Cook Nuclear Plant, Unit Nos. 1 and 2, Berrien County, Michigan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Date of amendment request: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  July 26, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Description of amendment request: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The proposed amendments would modify the technical specifications such that the requirement to measure the moderator temperature coefficient near the end of the cycle will become conditional. The test will not be performed if specified core performance benchmark criteria are met for the operating cycle, and the revised predicted moderator temperature coefficient is less negative than the moderator temperature coefficient surveillance limit presented in the Core Operation Limits Report.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> Criterion 1  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Does the EOL MTC measurement conditional exemption involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No. The conditional exemption of the most negative MTC measurement does not change the most negative MTC surveillance and LCO limits in the T/Ss. Since these MTC values are unchanged, and since the basis for the derivation of these values from the safety analysis MDC is unchanged, the constant MDC assumed for the FSAR safety analyses will also remain unchanged. Therefore, no change in the modeling (i.e., probabilities) of the accident analysis conditions or response is necessary in order to implement the change to the conditional exemption methodology. In addition, since the constant MDC assumed in the safety analyses is not changed by the conditional exemption of the most negative MTC surveillance measurement, the consequences of an accident previously evaluated in the FSAR are not increased. The dose predictions presented in the FSAR for a SGTR remain valid such that more severe consequences will not occur. Additionally, since mass and energy releases for LOCA and steamline break are not increased as a result of the unchanged MDC, the dose predications for these events presented in the FSAR also remain bounding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> Criterion 2  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Does the EOL MTC measurement conditional exemption create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No. Since the EOL MTC is not changed by the conditional exemption methodology of Reference 1, the possibility of an accident which is different than any already evaluated in the FSAR has not been created. No new or different failure modes have been defined for any system or component nor has any new limiting single failure been identified. Conservative assumptions for MDC have already been modeled in the FSAR analyses. These assumptions will remain valid since the conditional exemption methodology documented in Reference 1 does not change the safety analysis MDC nor the T/S values of the MTC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> Criterion 3  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Does the EOL MTC measurement conditional exemption involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No. The evaluation of the conditional exemption methodology documented in Reference 1 has taken into account the applicable Cook Nuclear Plant Units 1 and 2 T/Ss and has bounded the conditions under which the specifications permit operation. The applicable T/Ss are surveillance 4.1.1.4, and reference ``e'' is added to the list of references in Specification 6.9.1.11.2. An additional specification 6.9.1.12 is added to define the requirements for the ``Most Negative Moderator Temperature Coefficient Limit Report,'' which is described in Appendices A, C, and D of Reference 1. The COLR has also been modified as described in Appendix B of Reference 1. The analyses which support these T/Ss have been evaluated. The results, as presented in the FSAR, remain bounding since the MDC assumed in the safety analyses and the LCO and surveillance requirement MTCs in the T/Ss remain unchanged. Therefore, the margin of safety, as defined in the bases to these T/Ss, is not reduced.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied.

			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / Maastricht clouds cast shadow on Lisbon: Portugal has much to gain from fuller European union CLOUDS MAY have gathered over Maastricht, but Lisbon remains firmly committed to European union and deepening integration. For the Portuguese government, ratification of the Maastricht treaty is part and parcel of its ambitious plans for accelerated economic convergence with its richer northern partners. The treaty's survival, in one form or another, is therefore of key importance to Portugal which was stunned by Denmark's 'no' vote last month. The Danish rejection gave hope to the small band of Portuguese Euro-sceptics who see Maastricht's plans for deeper integration as an attack on the country's sovereignty. Ireland's 'yes' vote restored official confidence, though the government could rely on the European Community's enduring popularity. Polls consistently give over 60 per cent of Portuguese voters in favour of ratification with only a small minority - well under 20 per cent - against. There are good reasons for the Community's popularity. As the poorest member state when it joined in 1986, Portugal has received massive EC aid. Between 1986 and 1990, Portugal received Ecu2.9bn (Dollars 3.7bn), representing 1.6 per cent of its gross domestic product, in structural funds alone. Under the Community Support Framework programme agreed in October 1989, Portugal is set to receive Ecu 7.368bn for the period 1989-93, equivalent to 3.5 per cent of its GDP, and representing a subsidy of close to Dollars 1,000 per inhabitant. In addition, soft loans from the European Investment Bank and other EC institutions could reach Ecu 2.8bn. Portugal expects EC aid to double when the Community's next financial package for 1993-97 is agreed. The impact on one of Europe's poorest nations has been dramatic. Domestic and foreign investment has rocketed and the economy grew more than 4.5 per cent on an annual average between 1986 and 1990. Standards of living have risen and unemployment is under 4 per cent. Direct foreign investment rose faster in Portugal than in other peripheral countries, roughly doubling every year to reach above Esc1,000bn (Dollars 7.5bn) last year. A European Commission study says: 'Foreign investment. . . is contributing significantly to the restructuring of Portuguese industry in developing sectors, such as chemicals, pharmaceuticals, electrical and electronic equipment, and transport equipment, thus underpinning domestic efforts to strengthen Portuguese intra-industry competitiveness in the internal market.' Fears that competition from eastern Europe would be detrimental to Portugal have not materialised, and the Commission calculates that German unification alone caused an additional increase of 0.7 per cent in Portuguese GDP since July 1990. Full economic union will also have a positive effect. 'Portugal is likely to be a prime beneficiary of the advantages of Emu. Transaction costs savings and the suppression of exchange rate variability by virtue of a single currency will be very significant for Portugal whose currency is only marginally used as a means of international payments and whose financial service sector is not developed as in the richer part of the Community,' the study says. Getting there is the difficult part, and for Portugal which wants to be among Emu's founder members by joining in 1997 or by 1999 at the latest, it is a formidable challenge. Inflation, the toughest nut to crack, will have to be brought down from 11.2 per cent in 1991, more than twice the EC average, to within 1.5 points of the Community's best performers; the budget deficit cut from last year's 6.5 per cent to 3 per cent of GDP; the public sector debt brought to below 60 per cent of GDP; interest rates will have to come down and the escudo, which only entered the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System three months ago, will have to move into the narrow 2.5 per cent band. All the while, Portugal will have to grow at a faster rate than its Community partners. Portugal's convergence plan aims to satisfy all these requirements, some before 1997. But there is a constant danger of slippage. Critics doubt it is possible simultaneously to reduce inflation - and hold back wages when there is practically full employment - and maintain high rates of growth and investment. They also wonder whether the government has the political courage to push through the tough medicine needed to tackle budget deficits. What is not in doubt is that Portugal will need more help to restructure its agriculture and ailing industries, and to modernise its infrastructures. That is why it wants an early agreement on a new Community budget including the new 'cohesion fund' to help the EC's poorest members catch up. Help is important if the government is to contain growing social pressures. Farmers have demonstrated noisily against the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy which their leaders say could force 70 per cent of Portugal's farmers off the land. Thousands of workers in the textile industry face lay-offs as competition from within and outside the EC intensifies, and companies - not only in the textile sector - have campaigned vigorously for protection against what they see as a precipice opening up under their feet. Trade unions are flexing their muscles for a fight with the government over plans to trim the public sector which employs some 600,000 workers, representing 17 per cent of Portugal's 3.5m labour force. The government will extend help to farmers and it hopes that enough jobs will be created as an alternative for workers facing lay-offs in traditional industries. But it has less room for manoeuvre as far as public finances are concerned. The budget deficit has to be reduced to meet the tough conditions imposed by Maastricht for monetary union. With an overall cut in expenditures ruled out by the need to spend more on education and health as well as to co-finance EC-backed investments, reducing the public administration bill is a politically acceptable alternative to raising taxes, but the social and political strains of convergence are starting to show. With an election in the recent past (last October), the government has another four years to show that it can make its ambitious convergence plans stick - provided Maastricht itself remains on target.</p>

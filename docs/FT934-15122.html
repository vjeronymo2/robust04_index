			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / International Company News: Fannie Mae achieves 23rd record quarter THE FEDERAL National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) reported record third-quarter profits of Dollars 477.2m yesterday, up from Dollars 412.9m in the same period a year ago. It was the 23rd consecutive quarter of record profits for the company, which is the largest mortgage provider in the US. The strong earnings were achieved in spite of Dollars 50.6m in after-tax losses incurred due to the call of debt at a premium and the repurchase of high-coupon debt. The record third quarter took Fannie Mae's nine-month earnings to Dollars 1.38bn, well ahead of the Dollars 1.19bn recorded over the same period of 1992 and on target to outpace the Dollars 1.62bn earned in all of last year. Mr James Johnson, chairman and chief executive officer of the company, said various factors were behind the latest results, including a big rise in interest income, healthy gains in guaranty fees, and record income from the sale of Remics (real estate mortgage investment conduits). Fannie Mae's net interest income rose 5 per cent to Dollars 661.7m, following a 22 per cent increase in the size of the company's net mortgage portfolio to Dollars 179bn and a widening in its net interest margin (the difference between the interest Fannie Mae earns on mortgage loans and the interest it pays to borrow money) from 133 basis points a year ago to 140 basis points. As for Fannie Mae's readings on the state of the US housing market, the company reported that acquisitions of foreclosed single-family properties rose from 2,790 in the second quarter to 3,206 in the July to September period. However, it added that its serious delinquency rate for single-family loans, a key indicator of credit quality, declined to a 14-year low of 0.56 per cent. Fannie Mae's shares were unchanged at Dollars 80 1/8 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>

			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> BELGIAN KING BACK ON THRONE BUT FUTURE REMAINS IN DOUBT  </P> <P> Parliament returned King Baudouin to the throne today, two days after he agreed  to be suspended to avoid signing a bill legalizing abortion. But some unhappy  lawmakers urged changes in the law to reduce royal privileges.  </P> <P> There were no votes against putting the king back on the throne, but 93 of the  338 deputies present abstained.  </P> <P> King Baudouin, a devout Roman Catholic, refused to sign the abortion bill after  it was passed by Parliament last Friday. As the constitutional head of state,  he must sign all bills to make them law.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, Baudouin agreed to a temporary suspension. He was removed from the  throne Wednesday, after which the government enacted the law itself.  </P> <P> Prime Minister Wilfried Martens said his center-left government will seek  changes in the constitution to prevent future refusals by the king, on moral  grounds, to endorse legislation. He did not elaborate.  </P> <P> But it is expected that the government wants the royal powers, already largely  ceremonial, reduced further.  </P> <P> Experts said the king cannot cast aside his constitutional role only because he  morally opposes legislation. They said he can only lose his constitutional  powers if he is physically or mentally unable to rule.  </P></p>

			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: High-powered transaction I have been using a high-powered Mercedes car in my small family business. I intend to replace it with a more economical vehicle for business only. The Mercedes has been written down for tax purposes to Pounds 3,000 but, although eight years old, it is in excellent condition. I propose selling it to my wife for that price, for her private use. When she eventually sells, would she be liable for capital gains tax on any profit? No. It is exempt from CGT by virtue of section 263 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992. This says: 'A mechanically propelled road vehicle constructed or adapted for the carriage of passengers, except for a vehicle of a type not commonly used as a private vehicle and unsuitable to be so used, shall not be a chargeable asset; and, accordingly, no chargeable gain or allowable loss shall accrue on its disposal.' No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

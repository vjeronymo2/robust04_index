			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Gestetner suffers further decline to Pounds 8.2m midway GESTETNER, the office and photographic equipment distributor, yesterday reported a further sharp fall in profits at the interim stage after a decline to Pounds 22.5m in 1990-91 . The six months to April 30 achieved pre-tax profits of Pounds 8.2m, down by almost two thirds from Pounds 21.7m in the comparable period. Mr Basil Sellers, chairman, said the office systems division suffered reduced margins due to changing product mixes and recession. Photographic equipment saw no recovery in sales. But the figures included Pounds 3m of redundancy and other costs as 300 more jobs went, following last year's cuts of 1,000. 'We've got the costs down and will now just have to wait for the improvement to come,' Mr Sellers said. Group turnover fell to Pounds 440.1m (Pounds 451.1m). The UK contribution fell from Pounds 27.4m to Pounds 19.9m due to recession, while continental sales fell 9 per cent to Pounds 206.9m (Pounds 228.4m). Gestetner Canada is being restructured after suffering a Pounds 3m loss. Interest charges fell to Pounds 5.4m (Pounds 7.9m) as net debt fell to Pounds 96.4m, including Pounds 37.9m of convertible unsecured loan stock. This compares to net debt of Pounds 193m a year ago, and follows the conversion of Pounds 78m of loan stock last September. As a result, the debt to equity ratio fell to 40 per cent (114 per cent). Earnings fell to 6.2p (16.7p) or 3.8p (10.4p) fully diluted. The dividend payments of 1.8p per ordinary share and 0.075p per ordinary capital share are unchanged on last time. The shares fell 6p to 133p. COMMENT These figures were as expected, but Gestetner could have done without the Canadian losses. Costs are now under control, although cost savings are being cancelled out by inflation. Revenues from service contracts have provided some protection from the recession, the company is more reliant on the upturn and resumed buying of new office equipment. However, that looks unlikely to happen in this financial year and full-year forecasts of Pounds 19m-Pounds 20m put the shares on a slightly optimistic 15 times. While the range and quality of the company's products, and its large sales force, augur well for the longer term, the shares may not go much higher yet.</p>

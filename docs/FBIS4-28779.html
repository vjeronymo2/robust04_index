			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Prasong Susiri warned Burmese  students yesterday not to protest in an effort to bar Rangoon's  representatives from attending a foreign ministers' meeting of  the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.    Burma will attend the ASEAN ministerial meeting in Bangkok  in  July for the first time as the guest of the host country,  Thailand. Sqn Ldr [Squadron Leader] Prasong said dissident  Burmese students should refrain from conducting political  activities affecting Thailand's relations with Burma.    "The Burmese students who live at the (Burmese Students)  centre should know how to behave.    "It is not appropriate for them to conduct any activities  jeopardising relations between Thailand and neighbouring  countries while living here," the minister said, apparently  referring to Burma.    The Interior Ministry is attempting to block protests which  might take place during the meeting.    Interior officials are keeping a watch on Burmese dissidents  and ethnic minority groups including students at the centre at  Ban Maniloi in Rat Buri Province as the ministry has been told  about a plan to prevent Rangoon officials from attending the  meeting.</p>

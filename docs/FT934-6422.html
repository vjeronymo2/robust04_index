			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Edington may pay over 90p in pound Investors and creditors of Edington, the Manchester merchant bank which went into administration in April 1991, are likely to get more than 90 per cent of their money back. Mr Philip Ramsbottom, joint administrator and head of corporate recovery at KPMG Peat Marwick's Manchester office, will pay another 11p in the pound before the end of this month. The distribution, worth Pounds 3.1m, is the fourth, and brings the total paid so far to Pounds 24.2m, or 85p in the pound. Mr Ramsbottom expects another 5p to be distributed next year, in line with his prediction two years ago. However, much of Manchester's financial community now expects the distribution to exceed 5p, or to be followed by another payment. Edington - the merchant-banking arm of Henry Cooke Lumsden, the Manchester stockbroking and financial services group - was forced into administration after some local authorities declined to put funds of Pounds 15m back on deposit after withdrawing them to balance year-end accounts.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ahmad Muwaffaq Zaydan: "`Great Escape' in Algeria </F> Topples Military Commanders"]    [Excerpts] Algiers, Peshawar, AL-HAYAH -- Well-informed  sources in Algiers told AL-HAYAH yesterday that an operation at  the Tazoult prison (400 km southeast of the capital) which  resulted in the escape of more than 1,000 prisoners, among them  a large number of members from the armed Islamic groups, has  toppled a number of military commanders, reportedly including  security director Mohamed Tolba. And while President Liamine  Zeroual has stressed his determination to continue the "serious  dialogue," it has been learned that General Khaled Nezzar,  former member of the ruling Higher State Council [HSC], has  returned to Algeria from Switzerland to supervise the  presidency's course. And signs of a campaign the authorities  intend to launch against the National Liberation Front [FLN]  have emerged. [passage omitted]    In a statement, a copy of which AL-HAYAH received in  Peshawar  (Pakistan), the Armed Islamic Group claimed responsibility for  the operation. It said that it had carried out the attack  "after months of planning and training." And that this proves  the group's "ability -- with Almighty God's help -- to strike  wherever and whenever it wants, God willing."    It also said that "the daring operation resulted in the  freeing of about 1,000 prisoners among them more than 400  mujahidin sentenced to life imprisonment or death." [passage  omitted]    In the statement the group claimed responsibility for  murdering Abdelkadir Alloul, commander of the operations zone in  Oran.    In a separate statement, a copy of which AL-HAYAH has  received, the "amir" of the Armed Islamic Front (eastern  district) attacked some Islamic Salvation Front [FIS] leaders  like Kamal Boukhadra and Mohamed Karar, criticizing their recent  statements that armed action would be suspended if the  authorities offer certain concessions. He also attacked Cheikhs  Abdallah Jaballah (Ennahda movement) and Mahfoud Nahnah (HAMAS)  and other advocates of dialogue. [passage omitted]    It has been learned that military officials will be removed  from their posts as a result of the jailbreak operation. More  than one source has confirmed to AL-HAYAH that Security Director  Tolba has resigned and that General Bachin [as transliterated]  (former military security director) is a candidate for the  security minister's post. Maj. Gen. Zeroual received Bachin  some time ago.    Well-informed sources have stressed to AL-HAYAH that their  information indicates that an "all-out confrontation" between  the authorities and the armed groups is not ruled out. The  sources pointed out that the authorities are "under pressure" to  adopt this option, of which Maj. Gen. Zeroual does not seem to  approve, as he stressed in a speech addressed to the Algerian  people on the occasion of 'Id al-Fitr his determination to  continue the "serious dialogue" with anyone that respects the  Constitution. [passage omitted]    AL-HAYAH has learned that unknown elements sneaked into the  residences of five ministers and a former wali in al-Sunubar  Club (northwest of the capital) and managed -- despite the tight  security -- to enter their homes and leave threatening messages  and a warning in the form of a slaughtered or suffocated animal  (cat) inside the ministers' bedrooms.    Meanwhile, AL-HAYAH has learned from sources close to the  Interior Ministry that a plan is being prepared to hit the FLN,  because it has not cooperated with the government. And it has  been reported that some Algerian wilayas have begun to announce  their breakaway from the FLN and urge "loyalty" to the state.    Some sources expect the campaign against the FLN to be  represented in the expulsion of about 400 employees belonging to  the FLN from their posts in government institutions.    At another level, information -- almost corroborated -- says  that the HSC is still in power. And that it is still in control  of the keys to power, and that Fadhil Saidi, architect of the  HSC, who mediated between Gen. Khaled Nezzar and Gen. Liamine  Zeroual, is still an influential party to the power  "appointments." The information says that he was behind Ahmed  Yahya's appointment as director of the president's office, and  that he is now making new nominations.    The information says that Khaled Nezzar has returned from  Swtizerland to run the "presidency" closely, and that Ali Kafi,  former HSC chairman, has not yet moved out of his residence and  has gone back to lead the "Veterans Organization." Tidjani  Haddam, member of the council, has become President Liamine  Zeroual's "envoy." As for Ali Haroun, he is conducting his  "business" from Paris. Redha Malek, member of the council and  prime minister, maintains that political stability is  represented in his government's remaining in power.</p>

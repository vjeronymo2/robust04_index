			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Oil and energy prices will soon be freed Oil and other energy prices in Russia will soon be freed, according to Mr Vladimir Lopukhin, the Russian energy minister, writes John Lloyd in Moscow. The date will be kept secret so that energy producers will not hold back supplies. The price rises are expected soon, however, because the cost of subsidies is crippling to the Russian government. In addition the income of the oil producers is insufficient to stimulate investment and greater production. The energy minister is under great pressure from other former Soviet republics, especially Ukraine, to delay the oil price rise because of the economic effects it would have.</p>

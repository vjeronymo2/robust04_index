			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE BASKETBALL  </P> <P> TONIGHT'S GAMES  </P> <P> PACIFIC 10 CONFERENCE  </P> <P> ARIZONA STATE (8-4, 2-2) at No. 19 UCLA (9-2, 3-0), 7:30.  </P> <P> TV: None. Radio: KMPC (710).  </P> <P> UCLA hoped to gain prestige with a strong showing last Sunday at Louisville,  but the Bruins were blown out, 97-80, on national television. They hope to  rebound against an Arizona State team that has won eight of its last nine  games, losing only to No. 1-ranked Kansas in the last month. The Sun Devils,  though, are without their No. 2 scorer, guard Matt Anderson, who underwent  arthroscopic surgery Monday to repair torn cartilage in his right knee and will  be out for four to six weeks. Anderson, last season's Pac-10 three-point  shooting percentage leader, averaged 14.2 points a game and made 19 of 43  three-point shots before injuring his knee Saturday night. He'll be replaced by  freshman Brian Camper from Lakewood High. Forward Alex Austin averages 17.5  points and 7.5 rebounds for ASU. His brother, Isaac, averages 13.9 and 5.3.  </P> <P> No. 18 ARIZONA (8-2, 3-2) at USC (5-5, 0-3), 7:30.  </P> <P> TV -- None. Radio -- KNX (1070).  </P> <P> After losing to No. 19 UCLA and Notre Dame, the Trojans will try to snap their  losing streak against the Wildcats. Arizona has won seven consecutive games  against USC, the last six by an average of 31 points. USC freshman guard Harold  Miner has averaged 24 points in his last four games. Trojan forward Ronnie  Coleman is coming off the best two games of his career, having scored 27 points  against the Bruins and 26 against Notre Dame.  </P> <P> WEST COAST CONFERENCE  </P> <P> No. 23 LOYOLA MARYMOUNT (9-3) at SANTA CLARA (3-10), 7:30.  </P> <P> TV -- None. Radio -- KXLU-FM (88.9).  </P> <P> As the only team with a winning record in the West Coast Conference, Loyola  becomes the focus of its seven rivals, enhancing what has become a lively  rivalry with Santa Clara. Loyola's Bo Kimble is averaging 44.6 points and 9.5  rebounds over the last seven games while shooting 66% from three-point range.  Hank Gathers, averaging 25.1 points a game, and Jeff Fryer, averaging 21.5,  appear to be regaining their form. Santa Clara, tall and methodical, has always  managed to slow Loyola's pace, but the Broncos are off to their worst start in  Coach Carroll Williams' 20th season and were routed in their WCC opener last  week by U. San Diego, 96-71. Swing man Jeffty Connelly, who has been injured,  leads the offense with a 13-point average. Forward Nils Becker is averaging  12.4 points and 7.5 rebounds.  </P> <P> PEPPERDINE (6-7, 0-0) at SAN DIEGO (6-7, 1-0), 7:30.  </P> <P> TV -- None. Radio -- KWNK (670).  </P> <P> Pepperdine Coach Tom Asbury hopes that his team's on-again, off-again play in  nonconference games will serve as a blueprint for strong performances against  conference teams, just as it did last year. Asbury said the Waves struggled  last year prior to beginning conference play and then held at least a share of  first place until the final weekend of the season. The Waves average nearly 19  turnovers a game, and have been outrebounded by a margin of 3.7 a game.  Opponents have been getting most of their rebounds on the offensive boards.  North Carolina defeated the Waves, 95-69, Saturday at Chapel Hill, N.C. San  Diego is coming off a 96-71 victory at home over Santa Clara in a WCC opener.  The Toreros are led by John Jerome, a 6-foot-8 senior center who transferred  from Arizona State. Jerome is averaging 19.3 points and 6.9 rebounds. Reserve  forward Dexter Howard, averaging 14.8 points, leads five Waves in double  figures. This game was incorrectly reported as being a Wednesday night game in  Wednesday's edition.  </P> <P> BIG WEST CONFERENCE  </P> <P> FRESNO STATE (6-6, 1-2) at CAL STATE FULLERTON (6-5, 0-2), 7:30.  </P> <P> TV -- None. Radio -- KMNY (1600).  </P> <P> Fullerton is home after losing five of six games on the road. The Titans have  not played in Titan Gym since Dec. 16, when a victory over Cal State Northridge  gave them a 5-0 record. Forward Cedric Ceballos, averaging 22.2 points a game,  has recovered from a brief slump. Guard Mark Hill, averaging 21.8 points, has  been the Titans' leading scorer in seven of the last eight games. Fresno State  relies heavily on sophomore guards Wilbert Hooker and Tod Bernard. When they  each score in double figures, the Bulldogs are 5-1. Hooker is averaging 15.6  points, and Bernard is averaging 14.7, 18.7 against conference opponents. Chris  Henderson, a junior forward who transfered from DePaul, has been a key  addition.  </P> <P> CS LONG BEACH (9-2, 2-1) at UC IRVINE (2-11, 0-4), 7:30.  </P> <P> TV -- None. Radio -- KORG (1190).  </P> <P> The 49ers are 9-2 for the first time since the 1973-74 season when Lute Olson  was the coach. That team finished with a 24-2 record. This season, Long Beach  has lost only to Indiana and Nevada Las Vegas. The 49ers have been off since  beating Fresno State, 66-60, last Thursday. Irvine lost its sixth consecutive  game and shot less than 40% for the fourth game in a row in a 70-58 loss to the  University of the Pacific Tuesday in Stockton. Irvine hasn't won a conference  game at home since it defeated San Jose State, 91-69, Feb. 9, 1989. Since then,  the Anteaters are 0-7, including 0-2 this season. Center Ricky Butler leads  Irvine with a 15-point average.  </P></p>

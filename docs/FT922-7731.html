			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Finance And The Family: Court blow on NI BLATANT discrimination in the field of National Insurance Contributions (NICs) will continue following an unexpected opinion from the European Court of Justice this week. Women can claim the basic state pension, now Pounds 54.15 a week, after paying the full rate of NICs for 39 years. But men need to pay for 44 years, and a shorter contribution record means a lower pension. The differential of five years reflects the difference in the state pension age, which is 60 for women and 65 for men. The NI fund pays for several social security benefits including the basic state pension and those for sickness and unemployment. National Insurance is levied at 9 per cent on an employee's 'band earnings' - those between Pounds 2,808 and Pounds 21,060 per annum for the 1992/93 tax year. People who earn above the lower limit also pay 2 per cent on the first Pounds 2,808. An employee whose earnings exceed the upper limit would pay Pounds 1,700 in NICs for 1992/93. The inequality in the NI system is compounded by the fact that women who continue to work after age 60 do not pay the tax, even if they have already contributed for a full 44 years. The Equal Opportunities Commission challenged this system at the European Court - the supreme court of the European Community. Now, the court has given an 'opinon' that unequal state pension ages - and, hence, unequal qualifying NIC periods - were still legal under EC law. This opinion is expected to be confirmed within three months by an official ruling. The court's decisions are binding on member states and override national legislation. Last June, the government announced plans to equalise state pensions and it is expected to make a statement next month when the consultation period ends. The UK is one of four EC countries which still retains unequal pension ages; the others are Belgium, Greece and Portugal. EC law on state pension ages is unlikely to change until the draft second Social Security Directive (1987) is implemented, although progress towards equalising occupational pensions could accelerate this process.</p>

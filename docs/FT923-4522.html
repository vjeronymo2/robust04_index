			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Arts: Sculpted, silent and spectacular - Robin Lane Fox praises the scope of a Viennese exhibition that lays bare the glories of Egypt SILENCE WAS the key quality in old Egypt of the Pharaohs, according to the late Professor A. Momigliano, the most learned man in Europe. If so, both he and I would have hated it. Silence certainly prevails in the remarkable show of nearly 4,000 years of Egyptian sculpture, which is running in Vienna until October 4. Its setting is the elegant Kunstlerhaus. Against a background of cool dark blue, silent heads and sculpted figures take us through an unprecedented time-span of Egyptian modelling, from c. 3,500 BC to c. 100 BC, from the first kings to the time of Cleopatra's grand-parents. Many of the great names are here from gods such as Osiris to kings as old as Chephren. High officials and scribes keep them company, although I failed to find any trace of the FT's particular Egyptian favourite, Batson D. Sealing and his mischievous scribal pen. Vienna is an apt site for an Egyptian spectacular, although the background to the show has had its share of controversy. During the 19th century, Austria acquired a remarkable range of Egyptian sculpture, mummies and papyrus: at the time, Egypt was not so much the victim of rape as the willing server of her favours. Like biographies, art exhibitions inter-connect if you sample enough of them: an important figure in Austria's Egyptian collections is the same Maximilian whom visitors to our own National Gallery can see before the death-squad, as painted by Manet. Maximilian had been exported from Europe by the French as potential ruler over Mexico. To celebrate, he planned to load a large ship with antiquities bestowed by Egypt and sail them across to the New World for display in a grand museum in his new Mexican domain. The Mexican firing-squad was too quick for him, and his boat-load of treasures was diverted to Trieste and thence to Vienna, where it became one backbone of the great Egyptian displays. God, Man and Pharoah is the first big Egyptian show in Vienna for 30 years. Its moving spirit was Wilfried Seipel, the newish director of the Kunsthistorisches museum, whose appointment caused dark mutterings in certain corners of the Egyptological diaspora. There were unfounded allegations that he, too, might have done a Maximilian, and that the great success of his earlier career, an Egyptian show at Linz, was not the advertisement which his many strong supporters assumed. Certainly, it proved the strong Austrian taste for ancient Egypt: 260,000 visitors saw the show in Linz. God, Man and Pharoah is his sequel and in every sense his blockbuster. Its range is strictly limited to sculptures, hewn from hard stone, occasionally worked in wood and very rarely cast in bronze. Egyptian diplomats have contributed an appreciative foreword to the important catalogue which he has supervised and partly written, but the fact remains that not one object has been lent from Egypt itself. It must seem a missed opportunity, as the Vienna show is proving such a success and has merely reinforced its director's international standing. There is now the promise of a sequel in 1993, showing Egyptian objects from Egypt to make up for the gap. Rameses and his fellow-rulers are all very fine, but the beginning and end of this exhibition are its sensations. As usual, Egypt mesmerises us by its age. Around 3,000 BC a craftsman in Egypt could carve the bulging figures of a mother holding her baby to her chest. The pose became standardised later for the goddess Isis suckling her infant and then, by direct imitation, was adopted for Mary in Egypt, suckling Jesus. Around 2,500 BC, craftsmen were well able to work the lips, eyes and noses of human faces from a block of stone and leave it looking like an idealised model. It makes we visitors feel very small: these sculptures belong at least 1,500 years before anything which is known to be historical in the Bible. Whether these early sculptors attempted 'portraits' is far more controversial: like the catalogue, I felt that there was a hint of individuality in a fine head of the Pharaoh Mycerinus, lent from Brussels. From c. 650 BC onwards, the exhibition raises fascinating questions for anyone who puts the classical Greek tradition at the origin of European sculpture. This period saw a truly formative impact of English art on Greek architecture and sculptors: Greeks visited Egypt and learned there, a contact which is as historically secure as all those in Martin Bernal's fashionable book, Black Athena, are fanciful and misplaced. Bernal argued for a profound Egyptian legacy to Greek civilisation more than a thousand years earlier: the most important impact comes in this later period - not so much a matter of Black Athena as of Nut Brown Ionians up the Nile. As a loyal classicist, I have always been happy to believe that Greek artists first unfroze, humanised and animated the poses of the stiff, 'hieratic' sculptures which had become an ossified tradition in Egypt. If you look closely at the later exhibits in this show, the gap between Greek and Egyptian achievement seems to narrow. It might seem even narrower if more of the later works in metal and especially wood had managed to survive. Characteristically, scholars used to attribute a sculpture as fine as the rare royal head, cast in copper and lent here from Hildesheim, to the distant period of the Middle Kingdom. After its recent restoration, its dating has had to be drastically lowered. Here, the piece is classed under the period of the early Ptolemies, a down-dating of a thousand years. Among Egyptian sculptors, Greeks did not encounter a dead and lifeless tradition. Blockbusting shows have been criticised for uprooting treasures from museums and putting them at risk to travel in order to satisfy sponsors or nationalism. In Vienna, the movement of objects has had a happier result. It reminds you how great a range of Egyptian antiquities became dispersed over Europe during the years of 'collecting' up the 19th century Delta: this show draws only on US and European resources. It has also reassembled pieces which once belonged together. For the first time since excavation, a statue in Vienna dated around 1700 BC has been reunited with its base and legs, which had wandered meanwhile to Dublin. Across Europe, the sculptured pair of a husband and wife have also been brought back into partnership, lost since the moment of their excavation. Those who complain about blockbusters should remember that they can reassemble as well as put art at risk. Like its subject, this exhibition is austere and makes demands on the viewer. It is not scheduled to travel, but it is seriously important, like the catalogue accompanying it. By isolating sculpture from the other objects of 'daily life,' it forces us to look very closely at the range and endurance of Egypt's artistic achievement.</p>

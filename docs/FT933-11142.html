The purchase follows recent moves by the exchange to widen the participation of foreign brokers. Crosby will own the seat along with its local partner, Guotai Securities. Crosby said its purchase of a seat on the Shanghai market was a logical extension of its China business, which includes offices in Beijing and Shanghai.

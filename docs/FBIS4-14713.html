			<p>BFN     [Text] Tbilisi, April 1 (AFP) -- The Tbilisi police chief,  opposed to leader Eduard Shevardnadze's nomination of a new  interior minister, refused Friday [1 April] to leave his post  after being sacked and remained holed up in police headquarters  with armed bodyguards.    General David Zaikidze was dismissed late Thursday after he  and hundreds of his men occupied the Georgian Parliament for  several hours in protest over the appointment of Shota Kviraya  as interior minister.    In an interview with AFP, General David Zaikidze denied  rumors he had given Shevardnadze three days to sack Kviraya whom  he contends is unfit for the job. He said he did not have  designs on the post himself.    "I don't want to be interior minister. We simply claim that  Kviraya has made many mistakes since he began in the post,"  Zaikidze said.    Kviraya was officially appointed Thursday but has been  acting  interior minister for the past three months.    Prior to the interview, there were loud shouts in Zaikidze's  office after which a representative of Shevardnadze stormed out.    The rebel police chief was holed up in his office in the  city  police headquarters in the southern district of Sabordale under  tight security.    Zaikidze said he would not go against Shevardnadze and the  parliament but said "that they (parliament) must listen to our  requests and demands and the head of state must also listen to  us and reach a decision".    The atmosphere at police headquarters was tense, with  Zaikidze bodyguards all carrying automatic weapons.    The general commands around 7,000 officers in Tbilisi and  his  aides claim that the city police fully back the general.</p>

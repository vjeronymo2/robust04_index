			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUR COINS: SPECIAL BOOKS PAVE THE WAY TO KNOWLEDGE  </P> <P> Knowledge is the lifeblood of numismatics, and for the serious collector there  is no such thing as too much knowledge. Talk to other collectors and to  dealers, keep up with current periodicals and study the characteristics and  peculiarities of particular coins.  </P> <P> Another road to knowledge is through the wealth of numismatic literature that  has been produced through the years. In addition to some of the standby  reference books, such as A Guide Book of United States Coins by R.S. Yeoman or  the Standard Catalogue of World Coins by Krause and Mishler, there are  thousands of books on every aspect of numismatics.  </P> <P> What brings this to mind is a letter and catalogue from Art Rubino of Fine  Numismatic Books.  </P> <P> Rubino writes: "I am a mail-order dealer in rare and out-of-print numismatic  books and literature, as well as new books in this field. . . . Since a fine  selection of books on coins and medals is virtually impossible to find, even in  a large city, I believe that I can be of help to many collectors."  </P> <P> Rubino says his catalogue contains more than 200 pages and is used as a  reference source for current values for rare and out-of-print numismatic  literature. The catalogue is reprinted and updated monthly.  </P> <P> Sample listings include "Greek Imperial Countermarks. Studies in the Provincial  Coinage of the Roman Empire" ($75); "The Coinage of Nepal" ($110); "Byzantine  Coins and Their Values" ($96); "British Historical Medals 1760-1837" ($120);  "Handbook of Islamic Coins" ($55); "The Mexican Revolutionary Coinage,  1913-1916" ($70); "Coinage for Colonial Virginia" ($22), and "Counterfeiting in  Colonial Connecticut" ($45).  </P> <P> This, as I said, is just a sampling. The titles alone open up many new areas of  collecting interest.  </P> <P> Catalogues are $15 and are available from Fine Numismatic Books, P.O. Box 9712,  Santa Fe, N.M. 87504; telephone (505) 982-8792.  </P> <P> Question: I have inherited 20,000 English half pennies (1967) and 4,000 English  pennies. How can I best dispose of these coins? -- J.B.K.  </P> <P> Answer: That's a tough one. I'm not sure your coins have much value, especially  to collectors. You might contact some dealers in foreign coins or a coin  exchange company such as Deak. Another possibility would be to check with the  British trade office.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Coin News  </P> <P> Two new medals in bronze and silver have been issued by Israel honoring the  "Memory of Polish Jewry" and "Jewish Anti-Nazi Fighters." Both were created by  Nathan Karp. The "Fighter" medal (pictured) features helmeted heads of four  Jewish combat soldiers -- from the armies of the United States, Great Britain,  U.S.S.R. and Israel. Information regarding these medals is available from  Intergold Israel Coins and Medals, 23326 Hawthorne Blvd., Skypark 10, Suite  150, Torrance, Calif. 90505; telephone (800) 472-6327.  </P> <P> Dwight D. Eisenhower, the 34th President of the United States, is being honored  on the 100th anniversary of his birth with a silver dollar bearing his  likeness. It is the first U.S. coin to feature two profiles of the same person.  He's pictured as a five-star general and as a President/statesman by designer  John Mercanti. Pre-issue prices, good until Feb. 28, are $25 for the $1 proof,  $23 for the $1 uncirculated and $42 for a 1990 prestige proof set that also  includes a 1990 cent, nickel, dime, quarter and half dollar. To order, write  the United States Mint, P.O. Box 13682, Philadelphia, Pa. 19101-3682.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Coin Calendar  </P> <P> Today, Friday, Saturday and Sunday -- Long Beach's 12th Annual Numismatic,  Philatelic &amp; Baseball Card Exposition with more than 500 dealers will  feature Elizabeth Jones, chief sculptor-engraver of the United States Mints on  Saturday at 9 a.m. plus a British Royal Mint booth, auctions and special  meetings and forums.

			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / UK Company News: London Industrial Pounds 20m acquisition of 17 estates London Industrial, the property company which raised Pounds 14m when it floated on the Stock Exchange a year ago, is buying 17 industrial estates for Pounds 20m financed by a placing and open offer. The light industrial estates, acquired from A&amp;J Mucklow Group, are mostly in the Midlands, taking London Industrial away from its roots in the south east of England. The company was formed in 1986 to buy the industrial property portfolio of the Greater London Council. Mr Harry Platt, managing director, said the acquisition fitted London Industrial's strategy of buying properties let to multiple tenants which require active management. The new properties are about 82 per cent let, against 78.5 per cent for the company's existing 36 industrial estates. The deal is being funded by a placing of shares with institutions at 325p. Shareholders have the option of subscribing for shares at the same price, on the basis of seven for every eleven held. After the placing, gearing will be around 60 per cent, compared with a long-term target of 100 per cent. Mr Platt said the company would be seeking additional acquisitions in the London and Birmingham areas. The shares closed yesterday up 2p at 330p, against last year's placing price of 320p. London Industrial also announced an increase in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 355,000 to Pounds 905,100, reflecting the contribution of acquisitions made at the time of flotation. Earnings per share increased by 41 per cent to 8.6p and the interim dividend has been increased by 50 per cent to 3p. The company said that it intends to pay a final dividend of 7p, making a total for the year of 10p, against 7p last year. It added that the level of activity over the summer was higher than expected and occupancy had improved from 74.8 per cent at the end of the last financial year in March.</p>

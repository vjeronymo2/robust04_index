			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Foreign buying reverses Nikkei's downtrend SHARE prices, which had fallen initially on arbitrage unwinding, picked up on late afternoon bargain hunting and index-linked buying, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average finished a net 108.69 up at 17,931.25 after a low for the day of 17,686.07 and high of 17,944.20. The index fell on selling by arbitrageurs, triggered by a lower futures market. However, index-linked buying, prompted by short-covering in the futures market, and foreign bargain hunting pushed equities into positive territory by the close. Volume shrank to 200m shares from 294m. Advances led declines by 508 to 406, with 204 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks gained 3.70 to 1,356.31, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index shed 3.78 to 1,071.14. Foreigners were seen small-lot buying across the board. Mr Brian Tobin at SG Warburg Securities said: 'Overseas clients are active, buying up cheaper stocks, but domestic clients are only watching.' Activity was dominated by short-term 'theme' trading by dealers. Meiji Milk Products, the most active issue of the day, climbed Y35 to Y910, and Mitsubishi Kakoki, a water treatment equipment maker, rose Y110 to Y3,810. In addition to the bio-technology and environmental protection themes, dealers are trying to promote companies related to China, seen as a potentially large market for Japanese companies. Yaohan Japan, a medium-sized retailer, added Y60 at Y1,420 on the 'China theme'. Blue chip electricals gained ground. Foreign buying lifted Sony Y210 to Y4,290. Mining issues were boosted by higher gold prices. Nippon Mining moved up Y18 to Y469. Banks were mixed ahead of profit announcements for the last fiscal year, released after the close. Industrial Bank of Japan improved Y30 to Y1,820 and Fuji Bank Y20 to Y1,460. Before the market closed, Sakura Bank announced that its capital adequacy ratio for the year ended last March fell short of 8 per cent, the level required by the Bank for International Settlements. Investors, however, failed to respond, and Sakura remained unchanged at Y1,070. In Osaka, the OSE average picked up 158.77 to 20,600.52 in volume of 14.6m shares. Strength in Ono Pharmaceutical, sought on the bio-technology theme, encouraged small-lot buying in other issues. Ono, Osaka's leading active of the day, rose Y320 to Y6,490. Roundup PROFIT-TAKING in Hong Kong was the most significant factor in a mixed day for the region. HONG KONG closed sharply lower, the Hang Seng index losing 94.57 to 5,988.13 in turnover of HKDollars 5.3bn. Hutchison Whampoa gained 40 cents to HKDollars 18.80 on plans to privatise Cavendish, the existing issued stock finishing HKDollars 1.075 up at HKDollars 5.25. Hong Kong Land was 50 cents stronger at HKDollars 13.80 following Wednesday's announcement that it had sold a central city office building for HKDollars 3.8bn. Hong Kong Telecom fell 35 cents to HKDollars 9.75 on fears that revenue would be hit by a possible drop in the tariff for long-distance calls. The prospect of higher crude oil prices pushed Cathay Pacific down 70 cents to HKDollars 12.90. SEOUL declined on the detail of the government's plan to help investment trusts suffering from liquidity problems. Some analysts said the financial assistance would only help to reduce the companies' interest payments. The composite index slipped 6.60 to 578.63 in turnover of Won325.5bn. TAIWAN saw profit-taking in financials and the weighted index shed 40.36 to 4,501.02 in turnover of TDollars 21.9bn. Commercial banks were higher, with Hua Nan up TDollars 2 to TDollars 112.50 following the Finance Ministry's approval for its Hong Kong representative office to be upgraded to branch status. KUALA LUMPUR saw activity in Tenaga Nasional on its market debut, the shares closing at MDollars 8.75 for a premium of MDollars 4.25 over the offer price, The volume of 52m shares accounted for about 62 per cent of the market total.

Malaysian Airline System dipped 15 cents to MDollars 6.25 after reporting a 43 per cent drop in annual group net profits. SINGAPORE rose for the third consecutive day on institutional buying. The Straits Times Industrial index gained 21.61 to 1,528.15.

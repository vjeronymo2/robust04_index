			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PURITY OF VITTEL  </P> <P> In the May 6 Travel Section, Dr. Karl Neumann wrote that Vittel uses  "sophisticated techniques to remove potentially harmful chemicals and  microorganisms from water, techniques that local bottlers may not."  </P> <P> This is not true.  </P> <P> Vittel's purity is protected not by chemical or other treatment. In fact,  French law prohibits the physical or chemical treatment of bottled waters,  other than to remove iron or add natural gas.  </P> <P> Instead, Vittel's purity is maintained first by protecting its spring, Grande  Source. Second, exceptionally strict sanitary precautions are taken to ensure  that the spring, holding tanks, bottling lines and bottles are  contaminant-free.  </P> <P> Vittel employs a staff of 40 in three laboratories who perform a never-ending  series of tests to ensure that the purity of Vittel is never compromised. Thus  the purity and quality of Vittel is protected not by treating the water by  chemical or other means. It comes from protecting the original pure water.  </P> <P> RENE VIDAL, President  </P> <P> Vittel Mineral Water  </P> <P> Newport Beach  </P></p>

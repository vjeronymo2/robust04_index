			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ROYAL TAKES THE PATH OF LEAST RESISTANCE TO 2-A VOLLEYBALL TITLE  </P> <P> The Royal High boys' volleyball team, continuing a season-long trend, won its  second consecutive Southern Section 2-A Division title Saturday with an easy  15-10, 15-4, 15-4 victory over Canyon at Marina High in Huntington Beach.  </P> <P> For Highlander Coach Bob Ferguson, whose team swept all but one of its matches  in an undefeated season, the three-game sweep came as a departure from last  season's championship match in which Royal struggled to a five-game victory  over St. Bernard.  </P> <P> "I thought we shouldn't have gone five games last year," Ferguson said. "I  don't want to sound egotistical, but we didn't play well last year. We waited  to get going."  </P> <P> The Highlanders did not hesitate in this year's final, taking only 1 1/2 hours  to win the match.  </P> <P> Miguel Ramirez had eight of Royal's 11 service aces, including five in the last  game, as the Highlanders finished their season 20-0.  </P> <P> Adam White had 13 kills, Ramirez 12 and Mark Fiala 11 to lead a balanced Royal  attack.  </P> <P> "Holy smokes we played well," Ferguson said. "This was our best game this year.  </P> <P> "We beat Canyon in five games earlier this season, and I thought this would be  tougher. I told everyone at school that they should plan to be here for 2 1/2  hours.  </P> <P> Canyon, which like the Royal program is in only its third year of  interscholastic competition, completed its season 16-2.  </P> <P> Royal led, 11-10, in the first game when Fiala went to work. He had two service  aces and a kill and Miguel Ramirez added a service ace as the Highlanders went  on a 4-0 run to win the game.  </P> <P> Royal carried that momentum into the second game. Kevin Hambly had four kills  and two blocks and Fiala added three kills and a service ace to spark a 10-1  run that turned a 4-3 lead into a 14-4 advantage. Scott Enright's kill gave the  Highlanders a 15-4 win -- and a 2-0 lead in games.  </P> <P> The serve again played a big role in the third game. Royal trailed, 4-3, but  five aces by Ramirez keyed a 12-0 run.  </P> <P> Canyon Coach Ardyce Masters said that her team lost momentum after the first  game.  </P> <P> "I don't know why we died," she said. "You can't die against a team like Royal  because (it) will rip your face off."  </P> <P> It seems the Highlanders have been doing a lot of that lately.  </P> <P> The title was the third for the Royal volleyball program in the past 12 months.  Along with his two boys' titles, Ferguson coached the Highlander girls to the  4-A title last fall.  </P></p>

The trade talks  between the two countries had failed. Period. That was it.  There were no veiled declarations to give the impression that  the failure was less radical and brutal than it appears. They  would rather have no agreement than yet another bad compromise  whose negative consequences would only come to light later, to  everybody's disadvantage.    Trade disputes are not an exceptional phenomenon. However,  it is something else if the numbers one and two of the world  economy are seen fighting in public. And the fact that no  attempt was made to obscure the disagreement indicates that far  more is at stake than a dispute over a few percentage points in  import or export quotas. The dispute marks a not unimportant  shift in the relationship between Washington and Tokyo. It has  escaped no one's notice that the U.S. Government has taken a  more assertive attitude and is being consistent in its policy  since the election of President Clinton. This attitude is helped  by the economic recovery now taking place in the United States.    Clinton's predecessors, Ronald Reagan and George Bush, also  paid attention to U.S. trading interests, but avoided such open  confrontation. The scene when President Bush fainted in January  1992 during an official banquet in Tokyo is still fresh in the  memory. At the time, Bush was in the wake of leading  businessmen seeking to beg a greater share in the Japanese car  and car-component market. The collapse was felt to be virtually  symptomatic of the United States's lack of decisiveness toward  Japan in that period. Back then possible differences in opinion  were traditionally brushed under the carpet at the last minute  with hastily cobbled-together compromises which were  sufficiently unclear to allow everyone to save face. Just as  traditionally, the explanation of such agreements given by both  parties differed, which gave rise to new tensions.    President Clinton is playing a more open and much harder  game. He is demanding cast-iron guarantees rather than vague  promises which produce nothing in the end. Since 1980 the  United States and Japan have made no less than 29 agreements to  settle bilateral trade disputes. Most of them remained dead  letters and did nothing to prevent the Japanese trade surplus  with the United States increasing to $50 billion last year.    The international context also offers President Clinton more  room for maneuver. The end of the Cold War means that the U.S.  President can concentrate his attention on other domains rather  than pure security objectives. It has now been shown that he is  not afraid of confrontation with Japan in this new approach.  Some were assuming that the U.S. President would do everything  possible to stay good friends with Japan, because they have  geographical frontline positions with North Korea. The chill in  relations between Washington and Tokyo comes at the very time  when both capitals are keeping a close eye on North Korea's  attempts to become a nuclear power. The hard attitude of the  United States toward Japan indicates that Washington attaches  more importance to its national industry than to spotless  relations with an ally in its policies on North Korea.    In this sense it is obvious that the failure of the trade  talks between the United States and Japan has far wider  implications than simple trade policies.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Huang Ju: "A Shanghai Which is Embarking on </F> Reform and Opening Up is Making Great Strides Toward the New  Century," during the 1994 International High-Level Economic  Forum in Beijing on 12 May]    [Text] 1. The Status of Shanghai in China's Reform,  Opening Up, and Economic Development    The salient features of the contemporary international  economy are economic openness and a trend toward economic  integration. A unique position dictates that Shanghai, being a  metropolis in the Orient and China's largest economic center,  should bring its superiority into full play, directly join the  international division of labor, be a member in the grand  international economic circle, and promote the development of  the international economy together with other modern  international cities.    Geographically speaking, Shanghai is situated at the  confluence of China's golden coast and the Chang Jiang's golden  waterway. The Chang Jiang Basin has long been called the dragon  of the Chinese economy. Its population and land area account  for two-thirds and one-fourth, respectively, of China. It  produces 40 percent of China's gross industrial and agricultural  output value. As Shanghai, which is called the "crossing point  of river and sea and the metropolis of southeast China," has  access to information, a pool of skilled people, and a good  transportation network, it ranks top among the coastal cities  along the Chang Jiang and even in the entire country in terms of  industrial, commercial, trade, technology, and financial levels  and their input/output and investment return rates, as well as  the differential rent levels.    Seen from the market environment perspective, Shanghai is  the  most important hub linking China's market to the international  market. Historically, Shanghai has been an important center for  distribution and transshipment of domestic and foreign goods and  has been known as the "number one port among the five treaty  ports that have been open to foreign trade." At a time when  China is fully opening itself up to the outside world, Shanghai  is not only going all out to restore, but also consolidate its  top position. It has become a large exchange center for  domestic and foreign capital, commodities, technologies, skilled  personnel, and information. Shanghai's function as a market hub  is made all the more pronounced with the stepped-up construction  of such modern transportation facilities as airports, harbors,  railways, and expressways, with the successive establishment of  a number of state-level financial and production-factors  markets, as well as the construction of the Pudong Waigaoqiao  Bonded Zone, the largest bonded zone in China.    Seen from the perspective of reform, opening up, and  development, Shanghai is now standing at the forefront of  China's reform and opening up in the 1990's. Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics has brought about an epoch-making transformation  to China as a whole. With the implementation of the strategy to  develop China's coastal economy in the 1980's, the Zhujiang  Basin in south China took the lead in realizing an economic  take-off. With the marked increase in the nation's economic  strength and the gradual formulation of a strategy for  comprehensive reform and opening up in the early 1990's, the  Changjiang Basin, with Shanghai as the "locomotive," began to  become the important center for China's reform and opening up  drive. In April, 1990, the Chinese Government made a strategic  decision by opening up and developing the Shanghai New Pudong  Zone and called on Shanghai to build itself into one of the  international economic, finance, and trade centers. This  indicated that Shanghai moved from the sidelines and stepped  into the limelight of China's reform and opening up.    2. Shanghai's Reform and Opening Up and Economic  Development Have Entered a New Period    Here, I would like to report on the economic development,  reform, and opening up in Shanghai since the 1990's,  particularly in the last several years.    (1) The national economy enters a sustained and rapid  development stage. In the past, Shanghai's overall economic  development speed was lower than that of the nation's average  level due to the long practice of a planned economic system. In  the entire 1980's, while the nation's GNP grew at 9 percent,  Shanghai grew only at 7.4 percent. Shanghai gradually stepped  up its development and began to enter the stage of sustained and  rapid growth. The municipality scored a GNP growth rate  exceeding 14 percent both in 1992 and 1993. Quality of the  economic growth, in particular, was greatly enhanced. A number  of such new pillar-industries such as car-manufacturing,  communications, electronics began to take shape. The proportion  of tertiary industry in the municipal national economy grew from  21 percent in 1980 to 38 percent in 1993. It is expected that  in the next few years, Shanghai's industrial structure will be  further upgraded in a rational manner and the national economy  will continue to maintain the momentum of a sustained, rapid,  and healthy development.    (2) Economic structural reform has been carried out in a  comprehensive manner. Since the beginning of the 1990's,  Shanghai has carried out indepth reform centering on reforming  enterprises, markets, and government's administrative  structures, and has scored a number of breakthroughs in  progress. It has carried out comprehensive enterprise reforms.  Nearly 90 percent of state-owned large and medium-sized  enterprises adopted various ways to change their operation  mechanisms. By the end of 1993, 118 enterprises became limited  liability companies, 92 of them became listed companies. Nearly  3,000 state-owned and collective-owned small and medium-sized  enterprises experimented with joint stock operations. Some  enterprises practiced contracting and leasing operations. The  market system was improved. Eleven state-level exchange centers  and large-scale exchange markets including securities, metals,  grain, and cooking oils were opened one after another, with  total transaction amounting to 1,000 billion yuan in 1993, of  which the securities exchange market's stock transactions  amounted to 520 billion yuan. The foreign exchange regulatory  market's transactions in 1993 reached $5.3 billion, up 45  percent from 1992. In the course of a rapid transition from a  planned economy to a market economy, the municipal government  began to switch from a direct control of the economy to an  indirect one and to gradually improve and enhance the economic  regulatory and control system.    (3) A new pattern of opening up to the outside world is  gradually taking shape. With the constant improvement of the  soft and hard investment environment, more and more foreign  businessmen came to invest in Shanghai over the last two years.  Some 100 world-famous transnational companies like Dupont from  the United States, Mitsubishi, Hitachi, and Sharp from Japan,  Volkswagen from Germany, Bell from Belgium, and the Charoen  Pokphand Group from Thailand invested in Shanghai. Some 2,000  foreign enterprises recouped their investment and begun to earn  profits. In 1993, Shanghai approved over 3,800 foreign  investment projects, of which 3,600 were direct foreign  investment. Of the $7.79 billion negotiated foreign investment  fund, $3.175 billion was actually invested. Sectors that were  opened up for foreign investment also expanded from industrial  sectors to other sectors including finance, real estate,  domestic and foreign trade, and consultation service. Shanghai  approved the opening of 28 foreign bank branches. Shanghai is  becoming an open city which has adapted to the development of  the world economy.    (4) Our efforts to develop the New Pudong Zone have  gradually been shifted from building infrastructure facilities  to promoting the function of such facilities. In the early  1990's, the Chinese Government decided to develop Pudong. This  decision encouraged both Chinese and foreign investors. The  construction and development in Pudong were particularly  noteworthy as shown in the fact that funds kept flowing into  this zone through various channels. The volume of fixed asset  investment increased by more than 200 percent every year. By  1993, such investment reached 16.5 billion yuan, representing a  growth of nearly 11 times that of 1990. Infrastructure  facilities for transportation, energy, communications, and  environmental protection, including such backbone projects as  the Nanpu Bridge and the Yangpu Bridge, were accomplished one  after another, creating to the fullest extent, conditions for  improving Shanghai's investment environment. Four key  functional sub-zones have been fully developed and put into  operation. By the end of 1993, more than 200 projects have been  built in the Jinqiao Export Processing Zones. The acreage of  the Waigaoqiao Bonded Zone has been expanded to 10 square  kilometers, with nearly 200 Chinese and foreign enterprises  operating in it. Construction of 54 skyscrapers is under way now  in the Lujiazui Banking and Trade Zone. The Zhangjiang High  Technology Zone has been put into operation. In 1993, the GNP  gained in the New Pudong Zone reached 16.4 billion yuan or, if  calculated in terms of comparable price, a 200 percent increase  over that of 1990.    (5) Large scale infrastructural construction projects have  been launched. Friends who visited Shanghai were surprised by  the central district's dense population and it's narrow, twisted  roads lined with shabby huts, and full of slow-moving traffic.  This situation is undergoing a rapid change. In the early  1990's, Shanghai began to fundamentally get rid of a situation  in which urban infrastructure facilities lagged behind economic  development. The infrastructure facility investment over the  past two years is larger than that of the 1987-1992 period. The  Shanghai-Jiading and Shanghai-Songjiang Superhighways, the Bund  Overall Renovation Project, the renovation projects for Yanggao  Road in Pudong and Jiangsu Road in Puxi, the overall renovation  projects for Huaihia Road -- a famous commercial district, as  well as other major urban transportation projects, have been  accomplished one after another. In terms of the length and the  acreage of the roads, last year Shanghai witnessed an increase  of 62 percent and 53 percent, respectively, over the previous  year. The construction of the Line One Subway, the Inner  Traffic Link, the Chengdu Viaduct, and other projects are now in  full swing. They are expected to be finished and put into  service by the end of this year. It is expected that these  projects will improve Shanghai's traffic condition. Breakthrough  progress has been made in renovating old housing districts. In  1993, Shanghai accomplished its housing renovation projects with  a total floor space of 2.58 million square meters. It is  expected that Shanghai will basically accomplish the task of  renovating old housing districts by the end of this century.  <H5>  3. The Prospect For Shanghai's Reform, Opening Up, and </H5> Economic Development    The twenty first century will be a century for great changes  in the world's economic scene. Representing a forerunner of  China's reform and opening up drive, Shanghai faces an  once-in-a-thousand-year opportunity for development. It takes  great courage, profound wisdom, long-term strategy, and clear  thinking to seize the opportunity and meet the challenge. In  light of the overall pattern for the state's economic  development, reform, and opening up, Shanghai has adopted its  strategic goal for the next century. We are ready to build  Shanghai into one of the world's economic, banking, and trade  centers in about 20 years of time. Pudong will basically be  turned into a new urban district -- an export-oriented,  multi-functional, modern area boasting the top world standards.  The following three steps are needed to achieve this goal: To  lay a foundation before 1995, to form a framework before 2000,  and to basically realize the goal before 2010.    To achieve its long-term development goal, Shanghai will  devote its efforts to the following tasks in the 1990's: While  taking the lead in the establishment of the operation mechanism  of a socialist market economy and striving to maintain around 10  percent GNP growth, Shanghai will accelerate the pace of  allowing the domestic economy to dovetail with the international  economy. The city will carry out a series of major measures  that are suitable to Shanghai, including:    (1) In accordance with the policy of improving Shanghai's  economy quicker and better than other localities, Shanghai will  carry out a comprehensive reform of the enterprise system.  Shanghai is a place where state-owned enterprises, and  especially state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises,  concentrate. Bringing into full play the guiding role of the  state-owned economic sector will be of great importance to  achieving the goal of developing Shanghai's economy. To achieve  this goal, Shanghai will spare no efforts in reappraising the  stocks and assets of enterprises, defining property rights,  appraising properties and other fundamental work so as to  accelerate the establishment of a modern enterprise system.  Enterprises with favorable conditions should adopt the  corporate system, with the limited responsibility company as a  main form. Efforts should be made to improve enterprises'  organizational systems and set up large chain enterprises,  conglomerate firms, enterprise groups, and multinational  companies. In this way, we can help enterprises enter the  highly competitive domestic and international markets as an army  group and turn them into a major factor for promoting Shanghai's  economic development.    (2) To accelerate the establishment of a modern large market  system that extends over all regions. Shanghai will devote  itself to setting up markets for stocks, futures, off-shore  banking, gold trading, foreign exchange, and real estate -- all  of the things that embody the functions of a metropolitan city.  It will take active measures to create favorable conditions to  allow the domestic economy to dovetail with the international  economy. It will form as soon as possible a modern large market  system facilitating the circulation of domestic and  international funds, commodities, technologies, talented  personnel, and information.    (3) To form a large batch of modern industrial enterprises.  Shanghai will accelerate the strategic adjustment of its  industrial structure. It will focus on the development of  banking, trade, real estate, tourism, and other tertiary  industries. It will accelerate the development of pillar  industries such as limousines, electronic communications, steel,  petrochemical industry, chemical industry, and power station  equipment. It will take active measures to promote high and new  technological industry, with the focus on microelectronic and  bioengineering projects. In this way, Shanghai will be able to  bring its industrial advantages into full play. By the end of  this century, these industries will become industries with an  economic scale of more than scores of billions of yuan. Their  added output value will account for more than 50 percent of  Shanghai's GNP.    (4) Shanghai will accelerate construction of urban  infrastructural projects that are suitable for a modern  cosmopolitan city. In accordance with the requirements for  developing a modern cosmopolitan city, Shanghai will  comprehensively carry out a series of infrastructural  construction projects including telecommunications, energy  resources, water supply, sewage, and environmental protection,  while regarding the overall communications programs as its key  projects. Shanghai will accelerate construction of a second  international airport, the Pudong International  Telecommunications Center, an all-weather deepwater port,  underground railways across the whole municipality, and ring  roads. Eventually Shanghai will become a modern cosmopolitan  city that has rational urban structural designs, advanced  traffic networks, efficient telecommunications facilities, and a  favorable ecological environment.    (5) Shanghai will further develop and open up Pudong to the  outside world. With a total area of about 520 sq km, the Pudong  New District is more than seven times the size of Puxi's central  urban areas, is a new domain for Shanghai to develop its  economy, and has enormous potential for further development.  Shanghai will initially implement a comprehensive policy of  reform and opening up in the Pudong New District in an effort to  accelerate its development and opening up in an all-around  manner. By the year 2000, Pudong will have an urban area of 100  sq km with an increased GNP value of 50 billion yuan. After  accelerating the pace of reform and opening up, the Pudong New  District will eventually become a pioneer and exemplary zone  linking Chinese and international markets in an all-around  manner.    (6) Shanghai will gradually implement a strategy for  establishing the greater Shanghai metropolitan sphere. To  achieve its future economic progress, Shanghai must make full  use of the advantages of its special location, and  comprehensively develop all its strategic economic aspects for  progress. In accordance with the concept of "restructuring the  central urban areas, building more secondary cities, upgrading  the system of suburban cities and towns, and strengthening the  link with a network of neighboring cities," we will establish  the greater Shanghai metropolitan sphere that "has several  groups and circles with different centers which will, in turn,  have ripple effects on one another." The greater Shanghai  metropolitan sphere will have four different circles including a  modern financial and trading circle, a highly-specialized  processing industrial circle, a highly-efficient agricultural  circle, and a circle of neighboring cities. Hence, Shanghai  will make fresh contributions to eventually orchestrating  economic progress in the Changjiang River delta and to rapidly  enhancing China's economic development.    When the time comes, we will cruise smoothly in the sea,  cross the oceans, and face the world. Shanghai people are  enthusiastically and unremittingly designing a blueprint geared  to the 21st century. Global economic prosperity relies on joint  efforts of mankind. Today Shanghai, with its ongoing reform and  opening up to the outside world, yearns anxiously, as never  before, to enhance cooperation and exchanges with various  countries in the world. To realize its splendid objectives of  development, Shanghai must face the world and open up to the  outside world in an all-round manner. At present, Shanghai has  become China's most favorable area for investors. I sincerely  hope old and new friends from various countries in the world  will come to invest and launch joint ventures in Shanghai so as  to share together the forthcoming enormous benefits that will  arise from the invigoration of Shanghai and from the development  of Pudong.</p>

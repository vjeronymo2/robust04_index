			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Ruling on harassment reaffirmed THE US Supreme Court yesterday opened the door wider for employees to win lawsuits alleging sexual harassment at work. The court reaffirmed its previous ruling that sexual harassment could be proved by a hostile or abusive work environment, and overturned lower court decisions which also required an employee to prove severe psychological injury as a result of the harassment. In a unanimous decision issued yesterday, the court reinstated a case brought by Ms Teresa Harris against her employer, Forklift Systems, in Tennessee. Ms Harris complained that Mr Charles Hardy, Forklift's president, had subjected her to sustained verbal harassment, suggesting, for example, that she retrieve coins from his trouser pockets or go to a motel to negotiate a rise in pay. A lower federal court had agreed that Mr Hardy's behaviour was vulgar and offensive, but said Ms Harris had not shown that her psychological well-being was seriously affected. By making it clear that psychological harm was not an indispensable condition for proving sexual harassment, yesterday's ruling broadens the possibility for employees to bring harassment suits under a federal law known as Title VII.</p>

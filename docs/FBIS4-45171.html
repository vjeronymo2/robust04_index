			<p>Cochabamba   <F P=102>   PY2505214894 Cochabamba LOS TIEMPOS in Spanish 17 May 94 p A7 </F> <F P=103> PY2505214894 </F> <F P=104>  Cochabamba LOS TIEMPOS </F> <F P=105>  Spanish </F> BFN     [Text] La Paz, 16 May -- The Army General Command reported  on 16 May that the Armed Forces will carry out "anti-guerrilla  training exercises" in the tropical areas of Cochabamba and  throughout the country.    Army Commander General Reynaldo Caceres Quiroga told LOS  TIEMPOS in La Paz that "anti-subversive" logistic operations are  being carried out by diverse military units in the region. They  follow an "activities schedule" drafted by the Armed Forces  Third Department.    Gen. Caceres said that at no time has his command ordered or  instructed the Seventh Army Division based in Cochabamba "to  move military contingents" to Chapare, Ichoa, or Chimore to  carry out an "alleged intelligence dragnet to investigate the  existence of armed groups in the zone."    Caceres said remarks by General Guido Tavera Leyton,  commander of the Seventh Army Division based in Cochabamba, were  "misinterpreted" as a result of "superficial evaluations" on  regular Armed Forces "antisubversive" operations.    Caceres said: "All military movements in Cochabamba's  tropical region over the next few days are within the framework  of routine maneuvers scheduled by regiments and military units  based in the region."    Caceres added, however, that Gen. Tavera Leyton's remarks in  Cochabamba will be "thoroughly investigated" to definitively  establish what happened to the military announcements that were  released to the press the past weekend.    The military chief said that military activities in the zone  merely seek to consolidate education, health, and basic  sanitation projects in rural areas.    "Those projects in no way seek to fight insurgent outbreaks  in the zone. As far as the Army knows they do not exist, for  there are only indications of that possibility," Caceres said.    Last weekend the commander of the Seventh Army Division  based  in Cochabamba told the press that Army intelligence agents were  "moved" to the Chapare region to investigate the possible  presence of irregular groups linked with drug traffickers.    Tavera Leyton also announced that a report will be released  in the next few hours to inform the population whether there is  evidence of subversive activities in Chapare, Chimore, and Ichoa.    The military chief said that in June the Army will organize  an "active" operation of all military units in the Chapare  region to receive anti-guerrilla training.    Gen. Tavera said that the Rene Barrientos Ortuno Regiment  based in the Colomi settlement and the Captain Victor Ustarez  Regiment based in Tolata will participate in the anti-guerrilla  military exercises that will be carried out as a priority in the  Chimore and Ichoa area.    Tavera also ruled out the possibility of declaring  Cochabamba's Chapare region a "military zone" as a result of  "the growing" drug trafficking activity in this coca region.</p>

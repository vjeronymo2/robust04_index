			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Economic Diary: Other economic news Monday: The UK's narrow measure of money supply, M0, has consistently been growing outside its 0-4 per cent target range, a matter which has caused concern to the governor of the Bank of England, Mr Eddie George. Analysts are hoping that figures today will show that the annual rate edged down from July's 6.5 per cent. Consumer credit figures, also out today, will shed further light on the effect of the tax increases on consumer confidence. Tuesday: UK industrial production and manufacturing output figures will show whether economic growth is showing any signs of slowing down. Month-on-month figures can be erratic but both figures are expected to show 0.4 per cent monthly growth. Wednesday: The UK's trade performance has held up quite well this year. Figures for June's whole world trade are expected to show a monthly deficit of Pounds 800m, down from Pounds 1.03bn in May. Thursday: The Confederation of British Industry's quarterly distributive trades survey, out today, will give a further indication of the strength of retail sales and the health of consumer spending.</p>

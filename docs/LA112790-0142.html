			<p><P> November 27, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GARRETT BRINGS A NEW DIMENSION TO JOKES;  </P> <P> COMEDY: HE GETS A LOT OF MILEAGE FROM HIS HEIGHT. HE WILL APPEAR WEDNESDAY AT  THE LAFF STOP IN NEWPORT BEACH.  </P> <P> Six years after becoming the first "Star Search" grand champion in the comedy  category, Brad Garrett prefers to downplay the television talent contest that  lifted him from relative obscurity in Southern California comedy clubs.  </P> <P> After all, the 6-foot-9 comedian's career hasn't stood still since "Star  Search" host Ed McMahon handed him a check for $100,000 in 1984.  </P> <P> Since then, Garrett, who will do two shows at the Laff Stop in Newport Beach on  Wednesday, has appeared repeatedly on the "Tonight Show" and "The Arsenio Hall  Show."  </P> <P> He has served as opening acts for show business legends Sammy Davis Jr., Frank  Sinatra and Liza Minnelli. He also has been a regular on "The Hollywood  Squares" and "The Match Game," and he even starred in his short-lived CBS  sitcom, "First Impressions."  </P> <P> Garrett is still reaping honors. In 1989, the Las Vegas Review Journal voted  him Best Opening Act/Comedy Performer in Vegas.  </P> <P> But there's no denying that his big win on "Star Search" was the kind of career  break that comedians would kill their mothers-in-law for.  </P> <P> "It gave me six weeks of television exposure in prime-time on a new show," said  Garrett in a phone interview from El Paso where he was appearing last week.  </P> <P> And from that prime-time exposure, he said, one thing simply led to another:  After seeing him on "Star Search," Crystal Gayle asked him to serve as opening  act for her show in Las Vegas. "Tonight Show" staffers also saw Garrett on  "Star Search" and asked him to audition for them. And it was on the "Tonight  Show" that Diana Ross saw him and asked him to open for her. And then Julio  Iglesias saw Garrett open for Ross and asked Garrett to open for him.  </P> <P> "It just snowballed," said Garrett, "and here I am in El Paso. Isn't it  exciting? The hoedown's in an hour."  </P> <P> Garrett, who is on the road 30 weeks out of the year and works in casinos 12  weeks a year, is known for his deep baritone voice, his mobile face and his  array of characterizations and impressions that ranges from Bill Cosby and  Dustin Hoffman to James Earl Jones and Hulk Hogan (Garrett, in fact, provided  the Hulkster's voice in a Saturday morning cartoon series).  </P> <P> The Oxnard-born, San Fernando Valley-reared comedian is a former class clown  who, despite his height, never made it as a basketball player in high school.  As he says, "When you're 6-foot-9 and can't play ball, that's a lot of pressure  on a white guy. But I'm not supposed to be athletic. Everybody knows, Jews  don't dribble."  </P> <P> The one-time waiter broke into stand-up comedy in 1981 when he was 20.  </P> <P> Garrett's commanding height -- "I'm a little taller than your average medical  building" -- plays a factor in his comedy act. He always mentions his height as  soon as he walks out on stage.  </P> <P> "You have to," he said, "especially at the Laff Stop -- the air vent is right  over my head."  </P> <P> The dark-haired Garrett often says to the audience: "I know what you're  thinking: Gregg Brady and Herman Munster had a child."  </P> <P> Actually, Garrett is now doing Herman Munster in his act.  </P> <P> "It's probably the hardest impression I ever had to get, the voice and  physicality of it. The laugh was easy," he said, breaking into one of Herman's  booming-yet-silly laughs.  </P> <P> Garrett often gets requests to do the somewhat deranged Rev. Jim Ignatowski  from "Taxi," an impression that helped him win on "Star Search."  </P> <P> "It's amazing how many people remember that," he said.  </P> <P> In his current act, Garrett talks about being Jewish and dating a Christian  girl:  </P> <P> "She got me my first Christmas tree last year," he says in his act. "My mom  came over and flipped out because I had a tree. . . . I wanted both sides of  the family to be happy, so I set up a Jewish Nativity scene. It was nine  attorneys overlooking a small auto accident."  </P></p>

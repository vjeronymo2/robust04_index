			<p>940430 FT  30 APR 94 / Travel: The gamble on hospitality - Hotel file Choice of hotel is arguably the most important element of a hotel holiday - even more important, I often think, than choice of country. How can you know that the hotel you choose will be precisely to your liking: well-located, peaceful (or lively - requirements vary), comfortable, good value, and run by people who can spell 'hospitality'? You cannot. Staying in a hotel you do not know is nearly always a gamble. Friends can help. Those familiar with your tastes and foibles can be extremely useful. Ditto travel agents you can trust. Travel is their business. They junket extensively, gathering up-to-date intelligence - so make them swear, on the brochure they are waving, that the holiday they want to sell you is one they would buy themselves if they hadn't enjoyed a freebie. Brochures can be tricky. Study them carefully, especially the pictures. Ignore the puffery and try to imagine yourself staying in that hotel. Think about its location and facilities, let alone the rate. If the only picture of it in the brochure shows half a swimming pool or a chef waving a fork, avoid it. The pictures should reveal as much as possible, especially the bedrooms. At Easter, I stayed in the Forte Village, south-east Sardinia, which was built in 1971. From the four-page spread devoted to it in the Italian Escapades brochure, you get the impression that the village is huge; that it is proud of its food; that it caters especially to those interested in sports and fitness; and that it is ideal for children. All quite true. It is huge - 55 acres, three hotels, 438 bungalows, numerous restaurants, extensive sports facilities (including 17 tennis courts) and a health and beauty centre, the Terme del Parco. The food was good. The village is ideal for children, although an expert on the subject told me she was unimpressed with the facilities for very young ones; and the Hotel Castello, in which I stayed, is well managed. But the village wasn't me. I found it dull (it had just opened for the season, so was barely into its stride); isolated (but not if I had had a hire car - I forgot my licence); and far too big and rambly for its own good. Nor is it really serious about its sport. If you want sport, go to Club Med, or to a genuine sports ranch. At times, Forte Village hosts big corporate conferences, so you would have to trust to luck that you were not suddenly surrounded by jabbering conference-goers. Nor is the village cheap. Italian Escapades says that its holidays at Forte Village start from Pounds 649 per person per week (September 1994 price) for a twin-bedded bungalow, breakfast, dinner, return direct flight to Cagliari, and transfers between airport and village. Sports facilities are included (not watersports, golf or horse riding, which are available at extra cost), while entry to the health centre costs about Pounds 38 a day. The company adds that the price for staying in the village's Hotel Pineta or Hotel Castello starts at Pounds 698 per person per week. Those prices are attractive. But you need to study the brochure to see that they relate to two short periods: May 20 to June 3, and September 24 to October 7. In between, prices lurch far higher. In the peak period, July 23-August 19, a twin-bedded room with sea view in the Hotel Castello costs Pounds 181 per person per night, plus flight (charter: Pounds 199 return) and transfer from the airport (Pounds 40 return a head). Pretty steamy. At Easter, England football star Paul Gascoigne holidayed at Forte Village, which probably says it all. On the other hand, the Italian Escapades brochure is a mightily useful document: 168 pages covering a wide range of hotels. From studying it - especially the pictures, and the clues they offer about locations and bedrooms - I am 96 1/2 per cent confident that I would be more than happy in quite a few of them. In each case, Italian Escapades quotes chartered and scheduled air fares as separate items. You can book accommodation only. You can also fly to one airport and return from another. Italian Escapades: 227 Shepherds Bush Road, London W6 7AS. Tel:081-748-999. Forte Hotels: 0345-404-040. A famously agreeable hotel is Reid's Hotel, Madeira. It has almost everything: cliff-top location just outside Funchal, excellent food, good staff and marvellous gardens. Among other events, Reid's is organising its first opera festival this year on July 26-27. Cost: Pounds 687 a person including seven nights in the hotel, a reception, and two operas and barbecues. Flights are extra. UK reservations: 0256-841 155. In the same ownership as Reid's are two first-rate English country house hotels: Charingworth Manor, near Chipping Campden, Gloucestershire, and Bishopstrow House, Warminster, Wiltshire. They are chips off the Reid block. There is a type of English country house hotel - ultra-luxurious, ultra-expensive - that specialises in frigidity: so posh and conceited that guests feel obliged to whisper and tiptoe and dare not blow their noses, not even in the shrubbery. Charingworth Manor and Bishopstrow House are not like that. I found both extremely comfortable, enjoyed the food greatly, and was impressed by their facilities (each, for example, has a fine indoor swimming pool). Above all, thanks to invisible but skilled management, I found the hotels struck a perfect balance between quality of setting and lack of pomposity. At one of them, a waiter had a screaming fit at breakfast time - something to do with a sausage, or possibly several sausages - which added to the fun. At Charingworth Manor, room rates per night for two, for dinner plus B &amp; B, are Pounds 148-Pounds 207 on weekdays and Pounds 164-Pounds 235 at weekends (suites extra). Tel: 038-678 555. Bishopstrow House: Pounds 81-Pounds 114 per person per night, dinner plus B &amp; B (suites extra). Tel. 0985-212 312.</p>

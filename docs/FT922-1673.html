			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Shipper for trial on Nissan UK charges MR TORE ARNE THORSEN, managing director of Scansiris AS, a Norwegian shipping agency, has been committed to Southwark Crown Court for trial on charges alleging corporation tax fraud at Nissan UK, the former importer and distributor of Nissan vehicles in Britain, Kevin Done writes. Also named in the charges against Mr Thorsen are Mr Octav Botnar, chairman and managing director of Nissan UK, and Mr Michael Hunt, deputy chairman and assistant managing director of Nissan UK. Mr Thorsen was committed for trial by Teesside magistrates on Thursday. A warrant for the arrest of Mr Botnar was issued by the Inland Revenue in January, when he was in Switzerland. He has not returned since to the UK. The Swiss embassy said yesterday there was no agreement between the UK and Switzerland for extradition on alleged tax offences. Mr Hunt and Mr Frank Shannon, a former Nissan UK finance director, were committed last month by magistrates in Worthing, West Sussex, for trial on related charges of corporation tax fraud. Their trial, which was originally set for the Old Bailey, will also now take place at Southwark Crown Court. The charge against Mr Thorsen alleges that 'together with Octav Botnar and Michael Hunt' he sought to defraud the Inland Revenue of corporation tax. The charge alleges that with Mr Botnar and Mr Hunt he dishonestly arranged for invoices to be prepared by Scansiris with falsely inflated freight charges due from Nissan UK. The amounts were allegedly entered in the Nissan UK accounts for the years 1983 to 1992, resulting in Nissan UK's pre-tax profits being understated by Pounds 100m.</p>

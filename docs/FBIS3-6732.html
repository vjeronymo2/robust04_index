			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Panmunjom, March 19 (KCNA) -- The eighth working  contact for the exchange of presidential envoys between the  North and the South was held in the South side's portion of  Panmunjom today.    The head of the North side made a keynote speech first at  the  contact.    He said the whole course of discussions and working contact  between the North and the South in the past ten months since the  North side proposed the exchange of special envoys leads us to a  conclusion distinguishing between unity and confrontation,  between national independence and dependence on outside forces,  and between patriotism and treachery which are incompatible with  each other.    Clarifying the North side's stand toward the working  contact,  he said:    "Firstly, our side, considering that the four-point demand  we  have raised in keeping with the prevailing situation are  entirely just, insist on it again.    "Executing a swift volte-face, the South side is now crying  for a `tough reaction' against its dialogue partner. It is  openly blaring that the `Team Spirit' joint military exercises  must be resumed, the plan to introduce Patriot missiles be  reexamined and international `sanctions' be taken against the  North.    "This is, indeed, an act that scuttles the working contact  for the exchange of special envoys and brings the situation of  Korea to a touch-and-go phase.    "We strongly demand that the South side bear responsibility  for the obstacles it has laid intentionally to the working  contact and make clear its attitude toward our side's just  four-point demand at today's contact.    "Secondly, we cannot but take a serious view of the fact  that  the South side has tried to use the exchange of special envoys  for other political purposes, taking a dishonest attitude toward  the working contact."    He strongly urged the South side to apologize to the nation,  frankly admitting that it has abused the working-level contact  to hinder the DPRK-U.S. talks, fully revealing its dark  intention.    "Thirdly," he said, "we cannot but take a serious view of  the  fact that the South side is bringing the North-South relations  to the phase of an unpredictable confrontation by trying to  hinder the DPRK-U.S. talks and make the exchange of special  envoys abortive."    He stated:    "We will never look with folded arms at anybody trying to  ignite a war on the Korean peninsula.    "As we have already declared, we are fully prepared to  answer  dialogue with dialogue, and war with war.    "We makes it unequivocal to your side that we do not like  empty talk and will take every necessary countermeasure."  [sentence as received]    At the contact today, the South side repeated its  unreasonable argument, far from showing a positive attitude  toward the North side's just demand and position.    The North side urged the South side not to utter unnecessary  words but to give an answer to the North side's position and  clarify whether it would accept the North-proposed exchange of  special envoys or refuse it.    The North side sternly said that the South side was free to  part with the North, if it wished to.    Noting that the South side at a "high-level strategic  meeting" the day before yesterday adopted a "policy of tough  reaction" toward the North and said it would resume the Team  Spirit exercises, promote the plan of Patriot missile  introduction and join in "sanctions" against the North, the  North side said, "is this not a declaration of refusal of the  exchange of special envoys, a declaration of all-out  confrontation and war with the North."    Upset by this, the South side brought forward an "emergency  proposal" urging the North side to stop slandering the chief  executive of the South side and refrain from inciting the  anti-"government" struggle of the South Korean people and  exchange special envoys primarily for the solution of the  nuclear issue.    The North side turned it down, saying that the working-level  contact was not a place for making such argument.    Noting that the exchange of special envoys had already been  scuttled by the South side, he pointed out that the recent  "high-level strategic meeting" was aimed at foiling it.    "So, the South side must be held wholly responsible for  bringing the exchange of special envoys to a head," he added.    The chief delegate of the South side, much upset, said if  the  exchange of special envoys were scuttled and the working contact  broken up, the danger to be entailed by it is unpredictable.    The head of the North side told him: "Never mind. We are  prepared for anything. As I already declared in my keynote  speech, we are prepared both for dialogue and war. If any  forces took "sanctions" against and provoked us, we will  promptly take a decisive self-defensive measure. We mean what  we say."    The South side did not utter a word in answer.    Since the South side failed to answer our proposal, our  side said today's contact should be closed.    Closing the contact, the North side said it would come to  the  next contact if the South side notified it of the date with the  willingness to accept our proposal.</p>

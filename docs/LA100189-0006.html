			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Like many other viewers, I am hungry for Westerns. So I can't tell you how much  I enjoyed Hugh O'Brian and Gene Barry in the season premiere of "Paradise." It  was great to see them back in the saddle. The only problem is that "Paradise"  is such a bad program. What is the target audience? Is it adults or children?  The plot was too silly for adults and some of the content was too racy for  kids. The program is well-intended and well-acted, but those stories! Pew.  Also, NBC should make that perfectly acceptable and entertaining program  "Desperado" a series. My family and I would like that just fine!  </P> <P> Susan Richards, Palos Verdes Peninsula  </P></p>

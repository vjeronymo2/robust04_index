			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed editorial] </F>   [Text] This grave matter of a split reportedly being  orchestrated by some people between his majesty and the  [traditional] prime minister of the Zulu nation, the prince of  Phindangene, is a great tragedy for the entire nation.    Several times the prime minister has voiced his concern as a  Zulu about this issue that he finds so distressful. Whenever  such things happen the Zulu nation reads between the lines that  something is brewing within the royal house. We know that the  prince would not shed tears over nothing. We also believe it is  because of the bitter distress he feels about what might befall  the Zulu nation if this conspiracy succeeds.    We want to put it plainly that the majority of Zulus are  greatly distressed by these alarming reports concerning renewed  attempts to put a wedge between the prince and his majesty.    The big question people are asking is, since the prince has  time and again stated that he is unhappy about the machinations  of some to cause a split between him and the king, what is his  majesty saying about all these reports, and how does it all  affect him?    The people of KwaZulu now know the adverse effects that  might  result from a misunderstanding or a split between the king and  the prince of Phindangene. The people of KwaZulu now know that  if the campaign to cause a split between a them succeeds, the  royal house and the Zulu monarchy will be immeasurably damaged,  and the very authority of the office of the king will be greatly  compromised and endangered. This is what preoccupies the Zulu  nation on buses, trains, taxis, at markets, shops, church  gatherings, and even at wedding celebrations.    People are saying they want his majesty to come out in the  open because his continued silence over these reports is causing  confusion in his people about where their king stands on a  matter that is causing them such grief.</p>

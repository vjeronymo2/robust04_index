			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / International Company News: Volvo tries to soothe shareholders VOLVO, Sweden's leading manufacturing group, yesterday sought to reassure its shareholders over the proposed merger of its car and truck operations with France's Renault, saying the French government intended to privatise Renault by the end of 1995 at the latest. At a meeting of a dozen of the company's biggest shareholders in Gothenburg, Volvo stressed the French commitment to privatise Renault after the merger is completed. It said that Volvo's interests would be protected through the 35 per cent share it will have in the merged group. Criticism in Sweden, led by Aktiespararna, the Swedish small shareholders' association which wants the merger deal blocked at a November 9 shareholders' meeting, has focused on fears that Volvo car and truck manufacturing will in effect be handed over to French state control with no concrete guarantees over subsequent privatisation. The company said it had faith in French statements that Renault would almost certainly be privatised by the end of 1995. But it acknowledged that after privatisation, it could not increase its 17.85 per cent direct stake in Renault-Volvo Automotive, the operational company, without permission from the French government under its plans to hold a 'golden share'. However, Volvo said that under the merger agreement it could not be overridden on key issues, such as changes in share capital and mergers, because these will be handled by the RVC holding company in which Volvo will have an effective veto. Volvo's second-largest shareholder after Renault, a state pension fund, said yesterday that it would back the merger, increasing the odds against Aktiespararna's attempt to stop the deal. However, analysts said that shareholders would continue to demand more detailed information from Volvo, an issue which was not addressed at yesterday's meeting. Volvo also announced that its nominees to the six-person RVC board would be Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, Volvo's chairman; Mr Bo Rydin, its vice-chairman and a respected figure in Swedish industry; and Mr Soren Gyll, Volvo's chief executive.</p>

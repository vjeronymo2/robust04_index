			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHAVEZ AND FARM WORKERS UNION  </P> <P> A number of articles have recently appeared in newspapers across the country  bemoaning the plight of farm workers and the death of our union. The articles,  of course, blame me, Cesar Chavez.  </P> <P> Don't be fooled by these crocodile tears and these lies. The United Farm  Workers union is alive.  </P> <P> The charges have a familiar ring. The most recent article appeared in The Times  on Sept. 26, by Robert A. Jones, in his column "On California." It claims our  union is evaporating and that "the dream of unionizing California's farm  workers has also died."  </P> <P> It asserts that the current table grape boycott has "little or no connection to  the union." Agribusiness would dearly love you to believe that, just as it  would like you to ignore the dangers from pesticides. The men, women and  children who harvest the crops for your table feel differently. For them, the  dangers from pesticides are all too real.  </P> <P> "We live in the pesticides. We get in the pesticides. We don't know what type  of pesticides they are," said farm worker Gonzalo Ramirez, as quoted in the  Bakersfield Californian of Sept. 15. His 4-year-old daughter, Natalie, was  discovered to have kidney cancer at the age of 2. Since 1983, seven cases of  childhood cancers have been found in Earlimart, where the Ramirez family lives.  That's 1200% above the expected rate.  </P> <P> So we urge you to join farm workers and consumers everywhere who are boycotting  table grapes. It's for their health, and yours.  </P> <P> Throughout our struggle to build a union, agribusiness insisted we didn't have  the support of the workers. That myth exploded when a California law was passed  in 1975 that gave workers a chance to make their views known by secret ballot.  The United Farm Workers Union won about 90% of those elections.  </P> <P> As long as the law was enforced, we got contracts. We were certified to  represent some 70,000 workers at more than 400 companies.  </P> <P> When Gov. George Deukmejian came into office, he changed the Agricultural Labor  Relations Board, cut the funds, and made sure the law is no longer carried out  fairly. Since then, we have not been able to get contracts when those we had  expired.  </P> <P> As for our union headquarters being in the Tehachapis, it was not selected  because I wanted to have a monastery setting. The property was a gift to the  union.  </P> <P> Sure, we have had a high turnover in staff. Agribusiness calls it "purges" that  I ordered. The truth is that most of our staff are volunteers. That's all we  can afford.  </P> <P> As for the claim that I "never trusted or even wanted the farm workers union,"  the statement only proves that the author's entire article is intended as a  hatchet job, and has no basis in facts.  </P> <P> CESAR CHAVEZ  </P> <P> La Paz, Keene, Calif.  </P></p>

In his opening speech, Cindoruk said  that the Black Sea Economic Cooperation [BSEC] was an important  step in blending all the cultures toward establishing a  democratic and civilized world. Pointing out that increasingly  borders were being eliminated, Cindoruk added that the view  would dominate that worldly values can be shared by means of  peace instead of war.    [Cindoruk] The aim of the PABSEC is not only regional. The  joint economic and political cooperation achieved in the region  will contribute to world peace, to peace in Europe and Asia.    [Kucukbarak] Cindoruk stated that the aim of the cooperation  is to share democracies and wealth. Stressing that this has  started to come true, Cindoruk noted that the steps taken two  years ago have started to give fruit.    [Cindoruk] We, the people of this region, will protect our  independence and our contemporary values by loving and  understanding each other and by valuing a market which caters to  more than 300 million persons.    [Kucukbarak] Georgian Head of State Eduard Shevardnadze, in  turn, stated that cooperation is a must in the Black Sea region.  Pointing out that the borders in the region are slowly being  eliminated, Shevardnadze stated that this fact helps countries  to approach each other. Zeki Naci Tarhan, the head of the BSEC  legal and political committee, said that the PABSEC will  contribute to regional peace and friendship.    Cindoruk later visited Vakhtang Goguadze, Georgia's Supreme  Council speaker and deputy prime minister [title as heard].  During the meeting, Cindoruk said that although difficult, it is  possible to protect democracy and added: We will realize that  problems will lessen if we establish a joint political and  economic power.    Goguadze, in turn, said that after its independence Georgia  formed its best relations with Turkey and continued: The  problems ended after the iron curtain between us was lifted.    Cindoruk later met with Georgian Prime Minister Otar  Patsatsia. During the meeting, Cindoruk pointed out that the  Sarp border gate was not sufficient and proposed the opening of  two new border gates. Patsatsia, in turn, said that they want to  cooperate in all areas, principally in the areas of energy,  transportation, and communication. Patsatsia also stated that  work was under way to open the new border gates.    Cindoruk later visited Tbilisi University where he received  an honorary doctorate title.

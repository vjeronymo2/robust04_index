			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Arts: The Pocket Dream - Nottingham Playhouse This is a farcical fantasia on A Midsummer Night's Dream, in the manner of that notorious Theatre of Brent, but more so. It takes no critical line; mostly it consists of simple stage jokes, some of them evidently private Nottingham jokes. The cast play five or more parts each, including not only Shakespeare's characters but the players who take them in an imaginary Dream playing at the Playhouse simultaneously. Like it or not, the audience laughed like mad most of the evening, and were happy to help in the gags impressed on them from the stage. It's like a springtime pantomime. The traditional Mendelssohn ushers in a more-or-less permanent set, by Jacqueline Gunn. On this, Theseus (Phelim McDermott, but calling himself Simon Beaumont) woos Hippolyta (Louisa Rix, alias Phyllida Brewster) in a mist of dry ice. Where is Philostrate? He is drinking with most of the company at the Trip to Jerusalem pub, so the stage manager recruits a stage-hand, a PE teacher, the front of house manager and herself to fill in. Luckily the dozen fairies (aged from 7 to 13) are all there. They can fill the time elegantly, and amusingly, enough with Sue Rollo's choreography. The story is presented in a sequence of familiar scenes, though not all of it by any means. Quince's players barely register more than their existence at first, fair enough when they have to find 24 other parts between them. They get their head at the end, after the house has been urged to shout 'We want to see your Bottom]' at Neil Mullarkey. The audience was very obedient last Friday, rising and roaring in a 'Mexican roar' for the lion, barking like dogs, reciting in chorus, wearing funny hats. Most of the company are associated with improvising troupes, and there is that air of self-delight so often seen with improvisers - well deserved, at that, for there is some enjoyable foolery. There are obvious tricks, too, getting caught in the props, falling about, funny walks, funny voices, but an improvising company can no doubt improve them in time. Pip Broughton, the theatre's Artistic Director, directs the show, and she can always sort out anything required. Perhaps each evening should to be different, according to audience reaction. I heard one say at the interval 'I wish they'd get on with it, the good stuff.' Certainly a lot of Shakespeare's funniest lines, in his funniest play, are missed, and there is little romance between the love-struck four. Inserted business like Egeus/Oberon/Snug/Felix Barker (Mac McDonald, this is, not the former critic of the Evening News) singing 'No business like show business' in a spangled jacket, or the number about the greyhound race, is no compensation. The show is devised by Elly Brewer and Sandi Toksvig. Toksvig also plays Puck, mostly hanging from the flies, though she has some good moments on the ground too (as Stage Manager, Hermia, Snout, Wall), and speaks the closing lines splendidly.</p>

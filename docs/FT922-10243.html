			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / International Company News: Alcatel in control systems deal ALCATEL Alsthom, the French telecommunications and engineering group, is selling part of its control systems business to Yokogawa, the Japanese electrical concern. It has also entered into a co-operative agreement with Yokogawa for the rest of its control systems interests. Yokogawa has taken control of Controle Bailey, a company within Alcatel Alsthom's Cegelec division, which specialises in batch control processes for the chemical and petro-chemical sectors. Controle Bailey, which employs 220 people at its Paris base, made a substantial loss last year on sales of around FFr200m (Dollars 35.8m). The company has been in decline for several years after a buoyant period in the mid-1980s when its sales reached FFr400m. Cegelec, which had overall sales of around FFr17bn in 1991, said that Controle Bailey was too small to absorb the very high research costs involved in developing new systems. As a result it has been considering its disposal for some time in order to focus on its three core areas of activity  -energy controls, drive systems for processing industries such as steel and paper, and access control systems such as subway ticket machines and motorway tolls. After the acquisition, Yokogawa, one of the leaders in batch control processes, will no longer have any competitive interests with Cegelec, allowing the two to form their co-operative agreement.</p>

The foreign mass media quote reports of an anonymous  intelligence source, which maintains that the programme is being  implemented under the control of the Russian Defence Ministry.    In the opinion of experts from the Defence Ministry, it is  rather astonishing that the forgery, circulated in the West in  search of a sensation, was thoughtlessly repeated by some  Russian mass media organs, which had ample opportunity to  contact specialists and check the correctness of the reports.</p>

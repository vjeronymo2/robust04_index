			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Sri Lanka tries to revitalise coconut industry SRI LANKA'S coconut industry, one of the island's three traditional export industries, is trying to expand acreage and improve productivity and land utilisation, according to government officials and analysts, reports Reuter from Colombo. It is also exploring new markets for its products, in what has become a fiercely competitive industry, while fighting the effects on production of drought and the removal of a fertiliser subsidy. 'Production last year was better than the year before,' a senior official of the Coconut Industries Ministry says. 'We estimate 1992 production to be 2.3bn nuts as against 2,17bn nuts the previous year.' This year he expects a 'marginal increase' in production, 80 per cent of which is consumed locally. Two years ago output was 2.5bn nuts. The fall, according to the country's central bank, was caused by reduced fertiliser application after subsidies were withdrawn and the delayed effects of a prolonged drought. 'The government should give the fertiliser subsidy again,' says one broker. 'Fertiliser prices are too high for estate owners to bear.' Last year, as the prices of processed coconut products improved, the island earned an estimated Rs4bn (Pounds 60m) from exports, up from Rs3.4bn the previous year. Earnings from desiccated coconut sales accounted for more than half of total coconut export earnings. The price of a tonne of desiccated coconut, nearly all of which is exported, rose to Dollars 1,000 from Dollars 750 in 1991. The industry, the main market for which is the European Community, is trying to re-enter the lucrative US market for desiccated coconut, which it monopolised at one time as a pioneer producer and sole exporter. The American market is now dominated by supplies from the Philippines. Sri Lanka exported 460 tonnes of the desiccated product to the US in 1991, up from 280 tonnes the previous year. It is also eyeing former communist countries. 'There is medium and long-term potential, perhaps more than the EC, in Russia and eastern Europe,' the ministry official says. 'If that market opens up it might increase demand for desiccated coconut by 50 per cent.' Industry officials say that, in spite of growing competition from new exporters like Indonesia, the world's biggest coconut producer, Sri Lanka is able to hold its own because its desiccated product is considered to have the best flavour.</p>

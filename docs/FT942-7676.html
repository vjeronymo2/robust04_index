			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Farm tax resisted in Pakistan Pakistan's federal government has appealed to the country's four provinces to become more active in supporting its initiative to introduce income tax for farmers. The appeal followed months of speculation over the future of an important decision last year, when farmers were brought under the net of income and wealth tax for the first time in the country's history. International financial pressure has built up, however, following earlier reports that the provincial governments were proving reluctant to press ahead with the move, fearing a political backlash from the agricultural sector. Pakistan's political structure continues to be dominated by the country's wealthy landowners, who have directly or indirectly influenced the government's decisions. However, under a three year loan agreement signed with the International Monetary Fund earlier this year, Pakistan has agreed to introduce new reforms to improve its tax structure. Some officials say that a setback to the initiatives on agricultural taxation could make it difficult for the country to persuade its key donors and lending institutions, that its doing enough to improve fiscal management.</p>

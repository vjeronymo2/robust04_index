			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Singapore sentence upsets US residents Singapore and US authorities have become involved in a heated debate over a caning and jail sentence handed out to a US teenager. Michael Fay, 18, was convicted last week of spray painting cars and being in possession of Singapore flags and road signs. The teenager, a student at the Singapore American school when the offences were committed, was sentenced to six strokes of the rotan (a heavy cane), four months jail and fined SDollars 3,500 (Pounds 1,480). Mr Ralph Boyce, acting US ambassador in Singapore, said there was a large discrepancy between offence and punishment. Mr Boyce said the paint was removed from the cars with thinner. However 'caning leaves permanent scars' said the diplomat. 'In addition, the accused is a teenager and this is his first offence.' Fay's stepfather is the Singapore-based regional executive of Federal Express, the US courier company. The American Chamber of Commerce in Singapore said it could not understand how the government could condone the permanent scarring of any 18 year old - American or Singaporean - for such an offence. 'It is impossible to predict how this will affect American business activity but it is likely to cast a cloud over Singapore's international reputation,' said the chamber. The US is the biggest investor in Singapore. Singapore's ministry of home affairs said that unlike some other societies which may tolerate acts of vandalism, Singapore had its own standards of social order as reflected in its laws.</p>

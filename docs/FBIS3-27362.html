It is something new in China's mainland, which has been  following the principle of "to each according to his work" since  the founding of the People's Republic in 1949.    Today, this guideline for income distribution remains the  mainstay in the country.    Under Shenzhen's new distribution system, investors shoulder  the risks, as well as profits, of their investments.    No doubt, the newspaper points out, the new system does not  repel the principle of "to each according to his work," since  the labour force is still one of the key productive factors  among labour, land and funds.    With the deepening of the market-oriented reforms, more  Chinese people are not only aware that they can increase  earnings with more manual and mental work, but also they are  entitled to larger profits with more investment.    These investments include both money and properties.  <H5>  Migrants </H5>   According to the Shenzhen Special Zone Daily, local farmers  used to have the highest income, followed by immigrant farmers,  self-employed businessmen, enterprise employees, government  functionaries and temporary migrants.    The income gaps among these groups can be mainly traced to  their different amount of investments, says the newspaper.    In addition to the income earned through farmwork and  sideline production, farmers can get interests from bank  deposits, rent from let houses and profits from land lease.    By contrast, temporary migrants are only paid for manual  labour.    Shenzhen's experiment is conducive to developing a market  economy, says the daily.    Under the socialist market economy, the distribution of  income is based on a market mechanism instead of the government  monopoly; otherwise it would be hard to guarantee the fairness  of distribution.    During past reforms, Shenzhen has rejected many traditional  norms and adapted to new systems practical in a market economy.  The new income distribution system is another step forward.    Many new companies in Shenzhen are foreign-funded, with the  Chinese partners providing the land for workshops. In this way,  the Chinese side can profit by investing capital and land.    This is a concrete example of the new distribution system  and  should be encouraged, says the newspaper.    It can encourage individuals to invest their surplus funds,  land and houses into production, increasing the efficiency of  resource allocation, improving productivity, boosting social  wealth and creating more job opportunities, says the newspaper.    Also the State coffer can benefit.    Self-employed businesses in Shenzhen paid taxes of 314  million yuan ($36.1 million) in 1992.    Encouraged by the new income distribution system, the  region's private economy, as an engine of the local economy, has  been advancing robustly.    And personal savings soared to a record high of 17.5 billion  yuan ($2 billion) last year, the newspaper said. Meanwhile,  more and more people lease out their houses and invest in  industries such as securities.  <H5>  Fortune </H5>   Although the new system can avoid egalitarianism, efforts  must be paid to fight against smuggling, tax dodging and  graft-taking.    Policies and regulations must be enforced to guard against  social and political chaos triggered by the ever-widening income  disparations in the fierce market competition.    Since different economic sectors have increased co-operation  and infiltration, and people's income comes from various  sources, the management of distribution should target  controlling the scale of individual income.    The sources from which people earn their income should be  overlooked.    It is important to improve the management of individual  income tax, by issuing and seriously enforcing laws on taxation,  says the newspaper.    The government, aiming to bring universal prosperity to the  Chinese, should encourage different economic sectors to boom, as  long as they are operated within State regulations and laws,  says the newspaper.</p>

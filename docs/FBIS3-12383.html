Our people managed to wipe out the  despotic imamate regime, to expel the odious colonialism from  our pure land with the eruption of their glorious 26 September  and 14 October Yemeni revolution, and to restore their cherished  unity on 22 May 1990, and realize their democratic and ambitious  achievement on 27 April 1993, which exemplifies the Yemeni  people's generous offering.    Our people who have scored these victories are capable of  protecting and safeguarding them, irrespective of the crises and  the fierce attacks by the enemies of their revolution and of  their unity and democratic gains, and those who advocate a  return to the abhorent partitioning era.    Under these circumstances, the Sanaa GPC commands held a  meeting last night to discuss the crisis that has been besetting  our people over the past six months, and the deterioration in  the quality of our people's daily lives and the recent  breakdowns in the military area.    While they voice deep concern over these breakdowns, the  Sanaa GPC commands emphasize that they abide by the national  constants of the revolution, unity, and democracy, stress the  importance of complete abidance by the contents of the document  of pledge and accord and the need for the coalition parties, in  particular, and the other parties and national forces in general  to carry out serious and sincere work to implement its  provisions with a one-man team spirit and a united political  will, and to translate it into practise and immediately start to  return the military situation to what it used to be before 19  August to avoid sedition, prevent the differences becoming  further entrenched and the crisis from being exacerbated, as  well as having the political leadership meet and reactivate the  state's executive and legislative bodies to have them carry out  their duties in accordance with the Constitution, and the  respect for constitutional legitimacy which is a gain for our  Yemeni masses.    The Sanaa GPC commands also stress the importance of  immediate action to enhance the efforts that state leaders and  institutions are exerting in a cohesive manner to end the  people's living tribulation which resulted from the crisis, and  end the mad increase in prices.    The Sanaa GPC commands in these blessed days appeal to the  GPC command and to all the political parties to fear God when  they deal with their people and homeland. We must all work  united to avoid our people being dragged into the abyss which  will benefit only the enemies of the homeland who seriously seek  to harm its unity and democractic gains. From this premise, we  have to renew our victories along our national march in keeping  with the faith we have always placed in our people that they  will remain loyal to the martyrs, to the principles of the  immortal revolution, and to the blessed unity.    In conclusion, the Sanaa GPC commands emphasize that they  will diligently and seriously work out of conviction and will  exert all efforts to implement the document of pledge and accord  and to cooperate with all the honest national forces to overcome  all obstacles and decislvely tackle all the impediments that may  hamper the implementation of the document. We ask God to grant  success to all in service of the homeland's welfare, stability,  and prosperity.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prague Feb 2 [date as received] (CTK) -- The  government coalition Christian and Democratic Union-Czechoslovak  People's Party (KDU-CSL) is surprised and disappointed by the  Republican Party's invitation for Vladimir Zhirinovskiy to visit  the Czech Republic, KDU-CSL Deputy Chairman Tomas Rubacek told  CTK today. He said it would be fatal to allow Zhirinovskiy to  enter the republic at all.    Zhirinovskiy, Russian ultra nationalist and chairman of the  Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) which emerged victorious in the  recent parliamentary elections in Russia, told REUTER this week  that "the Czech Republic will lose Moravia soon and only Prague  and a few breweries in which the beer will turn sour will be  left of it."    The leadership of the far right Assembly for the Republic-  Czechoslovak Republican Party (SPR-RSC) announced this week its  decision to invite Zhirinovskiy to visit the Czech Republic "in  order to obtain information about the programme and goal of his  party."    "If some irresponsible person were to invite Zhirinovskiy to  the Czech Republic, then the invitation should be solely to a  mental hospital," Rudolf Opatril, spokesman for the  Czech-Moravian Centre Party (CMS) parliamentary group, told  journalists today.    He said that "Zhirinovskiy's babble, be it about Moravia or  anything else, is not a matter to be dealt with by politicians  or journalists, but by psychiatrists."    Zhirinovskiy is a person dangerous for the whole world,  Opatril said, adding that "it was impossible to react to his  statements by jokes" but it is necessary to resolutely condemn  him. "If someone invites Zhirinovskiy to the Czech Republic, we  will consider this an act of high treason," he said.    The government coalition Christian Democratic Party (KDS)  considered Zhirinovskiy's visit to the Czech Republic  undesirable, given his extreme views, the KDS said in a  statement given to CTK today.    "The KDS believes that the statements and behaviour of  Zhirinovskiy during his visit to other countries serve as a  sufficient reason for declaring him a persona non grata and for  not allowing him to enter the Czech Republic," the statement  says.</p>

			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / UK Company News: London &amp; Met talks to banks again LONDON &amp; METROPOLITAN, a property company with negative net worth of Pounds 54m, has begun discussions with its bankers aimed at securing agreement on its second financial restructuring in three years. The company, which has debts of Pounds 120m, said yesterday that the discussions with its banks, led by the Bank of Scotland, were 'proceeding satisfactorily'. In a statement which accompanied the 1992 results, which showed reduced losses, the company said it hoped an agreement could be reached 'expeditiously', and that details of the restructuring would be available by the end of August. The latest discussions were made necessary by the increase in negative net worth from Pounds 44m at the end of 1991, and because the banks' loans and working capital facilities expired at the end of June having been extended for a year last summer. The company has been struggling since a Pounds 100.3m loss in 1990, mainly reflecting provisions against falling property values, precipitated a financial restructuring in March 1991. At the time the banks accepted warrants in return for injecting new working capital, converting unsecured debt into five year debt and extending their secured debt. Yesterday the group reported a reduced operating loss on continuing operations of Pounds 7.4m in the year to December 31 compared to a Pounds 13.7m loss the previous year. Turnover fell to Pounds 25.9m (Pounds 28.4m). Net interest costs fell slightly to Pounds 12.2m (Pounds 12.3m) producing a pre-tax loss on ordinary activities of Pounds 19.6m (Pounds 26m). The loss attributable to shareholders was Pounds 17.2m (Pounds 25.2m) and losses per share dropped to 30.2p compared with 44.3p a year earlier.</p>

On the afternoon  of 24 December, a huge color picture of Mao Zedong, the great  man the people are familiar with and respect, was hung at the  center of the rostrum of the fully seated auditorium of the  provincial cultural activity center. A streamer with glistening  characters reading "1893 to 1993" flanked by resplendent red  flags, dark green pine and cypress trees, and fully blooming  flowers were placed up front. The "rally to mark the centennial  of the birth of Comrade Mao Zedong" held by the Jilin provincial  party committee started amid the magnificent playing of the  "national anthem."    Gao Yan, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee  and governor of the province, presided over the rally, and  Comrade He Zhukang, secretary of the provincial party committee,  gave an important speech.    Over 1,600 people attended the rally. They were leading  comrades of the provincial party committee, people's congress,  government, committee of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference, and military district; former  provincial-level comrades; leading comrades of the provincial  court and procuratorate; leading comrades of army units  stationed in Changchun and the provincial people's armed police  force; chairmen of the provincial committees of the various  democratic parties and the federation of industry and commerce;  responsible comrades of various provincial departments and  retired departmental-level comrades; responsible comrades of the  large enterprises, scientific research units, and colleges and  universities in Changchun; representatives of veterans of the  Red Army, veteran party members, labor models, workers,  peasants, intellectuals, Liberation Army, minority  nationalities, Taiwan compatriots, Hong Kong and Macao  compatriots, overseas Chinese, people from religious circles;  and some cadres of some provincial organs.    He Zhukang pointed out in his speech: We gather here today  with feelings of respect, to ceremoniously commemorate the  centennial of the birth of Comrade Mao Zedong, a great Marxist,  proletarian revolutionary, strategist, and theorist, and the  primary founder and leader of the CPC, the Chinese People's  Liberation Army, and PRC.    Mao Zedong, a great man of history who later had a  tremendous  influence on China and the world in this century, was born in  Shaoshanchong in Xiangtan County of China's Hunan Province on 26  December, 100 years ago. When Mao Zedong stepped up onto  China's political stage and became the CPC leader, he and his  comrades-in-arms accomplished the great cause that fundamentally  changed China's history and destiny, so that his name will  always be remembered and respected by the Chinese people.  Integrating the universal truth of Marxism with the specific  practice of China's revolution, Comrade Mao Zedong created the  Marxism of China--Mao Zedong Thought. The crystallization of  the collective wisdom of the CPC, Mao Zedong Thought is  extremely rich in content, including the idea on persistently  seeking truth from facts, integrating the fundamental tenets of  Marxism with the specific practice of China, and blazing China's  own road of revolution and construction; the idea on People's  Army and people's war; the idea that the CPC is the leadership  core of Chinese people and that only socialism can save China;  the idea of building and consolidating a republic under the  leadership of the communist party that exercises people's  democratic dictatorship; the idea on correctly handling the  contradiction among the people, mobilizing all positive factors,  uniting all the forces that can be united, and building a great  and strong socialist country; the idea on establishing and  developing the patriotic united front; the idea on independence,  self-reliance, plain living, hard work, constantly striving to  become stronger, and standing in the world; the idea on people  being the motivation to create history, persistently uniting and  relying on the masses, and serving the people wholeheartedly;  the idea on maintaining and carrying forward the fine work  styles of integrating theory with practice, maintaining close  ties with the masses, and self-criticism; and the idea on  comprehensively strengthening party building. Seeking truth  from facts, the mass line, and independence are the living soul  dominating Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is the  precious spiritual wealth of our party and the great banner  guiding our advance.    Comrade Mao Zedong made immortal contributions to the  country, the nation, and the people during his lifetime. Two of  these were most prominent. One was that he discovered the road  to the victory of the Chinese revolution during the period of  the new democratic revolution; and the other was that he led  Chinese people in establishing the socialist system and  conducted great exploration on building socialism. Comrade Mao  Zedong accomplished two great undertakings that changed China  and influenced the world. His great contributions have been  acknowledged by the world and become indelible. His meritorious  service is indelibly engraved in history, and his thought is  deeply rooted throughout China's vast lands.    Communists in contemporary China are the successors to  carrying out Mao Zedong's cause. Carrying out the cause  pioneered by Comrade Mao Zedong and upholding and developing Mao  Zedong Thought are the historical responsibility of communists  in contemporary China. As the chief architect of China's  reform, opening up, and modernization drive, Comrade Deng  Xiaoping, after acquiring a profound understanding of Marxism,  achieving accurate mastery of the national situation of the  contemporary China, making a thorough analysis of the changes in  the world situation and continuously summarizing the fresh  experiences in reform, opening up, and the modernization drive,  gradually created and established the theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics and brought Marxism to a  new realm and new height in contemporary China. This theory  provides, for the first time in the history of the international  communist movement and the history of the development of  Marxism, a fairly systematic and initial answer to the important  historical task of how economically and culturally backward  countries should build, consolidate, and develop socialism.  This is a new and tremendous theoretical contribution made by  Chinese communists to the international communist movement and  is the vivid manifestation of the youthful vigor of Marxism on  China's vast land. As has been proven in history, in the period  of democratic revolution, Chinese revolution would not have  succeeded without Mao Zedong Thought. Likewise, in the period of  socialist construction, China's reform, opening up, and  socialist modernization drive will not succeed without Comrade  Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics.    Comrade He Zhukang emphasized: In commemorating Comrade Mao  Zedong, our most fundamental task is to uphold and develop Mao  Zedong Thought, arm our minds and guide all our work with  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics, and continue to promote reform, opening  up, and the socialist modernization drive.    The purpose behind our commemoration of Comrade Mao Zedong  is  to always adhere to the party's ideological line of emancipating  the mind and seeking truth from facts. Emancipating the mind  and seeking truth from facts constitutes the quintessence of  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics and the ideological line the entire  party should uphold at all times. As we are pioneering a  brand-new undertaking, new conditions, new problems, and new  contradictions will emerge in an endless stream, and  opportunities will coexist with challenges, and hopes with  difficulties. At this moment, we should all the more adhere to  the ideological line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth  from facts because it is key to the smooth progress of reform.  To further emancipate the mind, we should continue to shake off  the fetters imposed by the traditional pattern of the planned  economy, truly understand reform as a profound revolution, and  channel people's ideas onto a track compatible with the  socialist market economy system. Emancipation of the mind  should be reflected not only in a change of concepts but also in  the courage to innovate and pioneer the way forward in the  practice of reform.    In commemorating Comrade Mao Zedong, we should clearly  understand the essence and characteristics of socialism and take  the initiative in firmly adhering to the party's basic line  consisting of "one central task and two basic points." To  uphold socialism, we should first clarify the most important  basic theoretical questions of what socialism is and how  socialism should be built. Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out:  "The essence of socialism is to liberate and develop productive  forces, eliminate exploitation and polarization, and ultimately  achieve common prosperity." This incisive scientific theory  provides the most fundamental answers to the important questions  of what socialism is and how socialism should be built and helps  unify the thinking of the entire party and the people across the  country. His emphasizing that reform is to liberate and develop  productive forces and to ultimately achieve common prosperity  means his persisting in the unity between means and purpose; his  emphasizing that the superiority of socialism should be  reflected in the development of productive forces and that  socialism is to eliminate exploitation and polarization means  his persisting in the unity between the criterion of productive  forces and the criterion of people's interests; and his  emphasizing that development of productive forces should be  promoted by upholding the four cardinal principles, deepening  reform, and opening wider to the outside world means his  persisting in the unity between the "one central task" and the  "two basic points" of the party's basic line.    In commemorating Comrade Mao Zedong, we should devote more  efforts to reform and opening up and establish the socialist  market economy system more rapidly. Economic development is the  foundation for us to solve all problems. Comrade Deng Xiaoping  clearly pointed out: "Development is the essential criterion,"  and "development decides on the basic solutions to problems."  The momentum for development lies in reform, and the basic way  to accelerate development lies in accelerating reform. Reform  has reached a crucial period, a period for resolving the  greatest difficulty in combining package reform with  breakthroughs in key areas. This requires that we devote  greater efforts to accelerating reform. The "decision of the  CPC Central Committee on the several issues concerning the  establishment of the socialist market economy system" adopted at  the Third Plenary Session of the 14th Party Central Committee  systematizes and specifies the reform targets and basic  principles of the economic system defined at the 14th party  congress and formulates a program of action for changing the old  system to the new and for accelerating reform. We should  conscientiously implement the guidelines of the "decision,"  emphasize reform, extend the degree of reform, and accelerate  development by accelerating reform.    In commemorating Comrade Mao Zedong, we should  conscientiously strengthen party building and improve the  party's combat effectiveness. Party building is a magic weapon  to win the success in Chinese revolution and construction.  Strengthening party building means to arm the entire party with  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics to raise the ideological and theoretical  level of cadres with party membership, especially leading  cadres; means to do a good job in improving leading bodies at  all levels, resolutely implement the principle of democratic  centralism, safeguard the unity and solidarity of the party,  raise the awareness and be more steadfast in adhering to the  party's basic line, and improve the ability to lead reform and  develop the market economy; means to persistently build the  material civilization and improve the socialist spiritual  civilization and to be strong in doing both as consistently  advocated by Comrade Deng Xiaoping; means to correct party  style, step up efforts in building a clean government, wage the  anticorruption struggle, and carry it on with unremitting  efforts; and means to do a good job in improving grass-roots  party organizations, give full play to the leading and exemplary  role of party members, firmly remember the purpose of serving  the people wholeheartedly, maintain close ties with the masses,  and better unite and lead the masses to plunge themselves into  the great practice of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics.    In commemorating Comrade Mao Zedong, we should learn from  the noble examples and characters of Comrades Mao Zedong and  Deng Xiaoping and other revolutionaries of the older generation.  Their revolutionary examples and characters tempered through the  long revolutionary struggle are the valuable spiritual wealth of  our party. We should learn from their strong sense of  historical mission and responsibility manifested in their  lifelong concern for the future and destiny of the country and  the nation; learn from their sacrificing spirit manifested in  their respect for the masses, ardent love for the people,  concern at all times for the interests and desires of the  broadest part of the masses, and dedication to the liberation  and development of the nation; learn from their firm faith in  socialism and their tremendous courage to get rid of  difficulties when the revolution encountered detours and was at  a low tide; learn from their foresightedness, ability to observe  and handle issues by taking the whole situation into account,  and scientific approach to adopt specific measures to solve  specific problems; learn from their patriotic values manifested  in their unyieldingness toward external pressure and firm  defense of state sovereignty and national dignity; and learn  from their noble character of openheartedness and their  awareness in party spirit manifested in their unselfishness and  adherence to principles. We should take them as good examples,  draw strength from their noble examples and characters, perform  our duties more successfully, and work harder to live up to the  ardent expectations of the proletarian revolutionaries of the  older generation.    The rally concluded amid the magnificent playing of the  "national anthem." A large literary and art performance was  held there by the propaganda department of the provincial party  committee and the provincial culture department after the rally.  With respect for Comrade Mao Zedong, performers of the  provincial song and dance ensemble, the provincial national  orchestra, the provincial Beijing Opera troupe, and the  institute of art staged rich and colorful music, dance, and  Beijing Opera programs.</p>

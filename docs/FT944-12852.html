			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / Franco-Canadian proposal on new OECD chief under fire The search for a new secretary-general of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development is again in disarray, with several new options being discussed by the 25 member countries of the Paris-based research body. The US and Japan are understood to have rejected a compromise put forward by France and Canada in recent weeks to break the long impasse between their respective candidates, Mr Jean-Claude Paye and Mr Donald Johnston. Under this proposal, Mr Paye, the outgoing secretary-general who has already served two terms, would be reinstated for another two years, to be followed by a full five-year term for Mr Johnston. The US, which insists the OECD post should be filled by a non-European, has rejected any extension of Mr Paye's term. Japan is said to be unhappy that the Franco-Canadian plan would tie up the job for seven years. France and Canada are banking on a compromise which, for in-stance, might allow Mr Paye to serve one year, and Mr Johnston four. Mr Jean Chretien, Canada's prime minister, has telephoned the heads of several other OECD governments to revive support for Mr Johnston, whose chances were fading until the Canadians put forward the 'two-plus-five' formula to French officials earlier this month. However, one European official predicted that the impasse over the OECD job may not be broken until a choice is made for secretary-general of the new World Trade Organisation, which is due to come into being on January 1. The three contenders for the WTO job are Mexico's President Carlos Salinas, Mr Renato Ruggiero of Italy, and Mr Kim Chul-su, South Korea's trade minister. Mr Salinas currently appears to be the WTO front-runner. But some European governments have indicated that they will not accept North Americans in both the WTO and OECD jobs. One scenario being discussed is that, if the WTO goes to Mr Salinas, Mr Ruggiero may end up at the OECD. While obstacles facing Mr Paye and Mr Johnston have again opened the way for a third candidate, the UK is understood no longer to be pressing the candidacy of Lord Lawson, former chancellor of the exchequer.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Today the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet adopted a law on  local power bodies and local rule. Deputies rejected the  amendments providing for subordination of the local authorities  to the Ukrainian president. Observers in Kiev say that this  limited the powers of the president at a local level.    In accordance with the law, the heads of the local bodies  will be subordinated only to the cabinet of ministers and to the  Councils of a higher authority.    On 26 June (after the local elections) the powers of the  regional administrations will be transferred to the chairmen and  executive committees of the Councils. The Councils' deputies  will have the right to be a part of the local executive power.    A member of the parliamentary commission on legal policy,  Sergey Sobolev, called on the Ukrainian president not to sign  this law since, he said, it contradicted the Ukrainian  Constitution. In accordance with provision 89 of the  Constitution, deputies of the local councils cannot be members  of the executive committees.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Ankara (DPA) -- Germany and Britain have promised  support to Turkey, as an important country on the border between  Europe and Asia, but also warned it to adhere to human rights.  After talks with Douglas Hurd and Hikmet Cetin, his British and  Turkish counterparts, Federal Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel  underlined in Ankara today Turkey's role as a factor for  stability in the region.    Kinkel and Hurd stressed Turkey's increasing importance as a  country "on the border between Europe and Asia, between a  disintegrating communism and an Islam that has regained  strength." Turkey should therefore be supported in its regional  role, which is important for the stabilization of conditions in  the region, Kinkel said.    Kinkel, who also met President Suleyman Demirel and Prime  Minister Tansu Ciller as well as the national-liberal opposition  leader Mesut Yilmaz, reminded Turkey to speedily implement the  reform of the judicial system and improve the human rights  situation. Turkey must conduct the struggle against the  militant Workers Party of Kurdistan (PKK) in line with democracy  and principles based on the rule of law. "We are not speaking  with an admonishing finger, but with a well-disposed view of  Turkey," Kinkel said.    Cetin said Turkey is conducting the struggle against the PKK  in line with democracy and human rights. He confirmed that Hurd  and Kinkel also raised the situation of the Orthodox Christians  in southeastern Turkey. "However, it is not Turkey but the PKK  which drove the Christians out of their villages, and the  Christians themselves are calling on us to help them return to  their villages," Cetin said.    Kinkel and Hurd confirmed their adherence to the  inviolability of the borders of the states in the region. "What  we want is not new states, but cultural autonomy for the Kurds  to enable them to preserve and cultivate their identity," Kinkel  said. He spoke in favor of supporting Turkey in overcoming its  problems and bringing it closer to Europe as a politically,  economically, and culturally important partner.    Other topics in the trilateral meeting, which, according to  Turkish information, will be repeated in London this year, were  developments in the Caucasus and in the Balkans.</p>

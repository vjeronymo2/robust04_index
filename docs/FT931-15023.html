			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / French cohabitation unlikely to follow path of true love: The right is heading for a crushing election victory, but President Mitterrand has plenty of tricks in store FRANCE is soon to become embroiled in a constitutional chess game between the wily but ageing President Francois Mitterrand and a powerful but fragmented right-wing. The next move will be the March parliamentary election, where the Socialists face crushing defeat by a coalition of RPR Gaullists and the centre-right UDF, who, if recent polls are right, will take at least 400 seats in the 577-seat national assembly. This will usher in a second period of 'cohabitation' between a left-wing president and right-wing government. The right is likely to have a far larger majority this time than in the first, in 1986-88, and Mr Mitterrand is much less popular now than then. It is seen as the beginning of the end for Mr Mitterrand, 76, whose term runs out in two years. But as usual, he has a few tricks up his sleeve. Mr Mitterrand has distanced himself from daily politics and even from his own party, to concentrate on what looks at first like a somewhat academic plan to reform the constitution. Yet it is far from that. Mr Mitterrand has taken the high ground in a running public debate, led by the right which campaigns against Mr Mitterrand's 'monarchical drift', on whether France wants to move from a presidential system to a more parliamentary style of democracy. In this way he has chosen, following Napoleon's first rule of engagement, his own battlefield for the election campaign which is now getting under way and for the early days of the next national assembly. The main drift of the reform plan, launched by Mr Mitterrand last month, is to strengthen one of Europe's weakest parliaments at the expense of the prime minister and government, but not of the president. He has suggested, for example, curbs on the government's freedom to override parliament. The government has in the past four years resorted 19 times to a guillotine motion under the constitution's Article 49-3 to pass legislation without a vote, a technique which has contributed to the Socialist party's unpopularity. A shortening of the seven-year presidential term is also up for discussion, though Mr Mitterrand says this would apply to future presidents, not him. A consultative committee of lawyers and academics invited by the government and boycotted by the right, is due to report to the president on constitutional reform by February 15. He will then table his plan, one of the first pieces of legislation to be discussed by the new parliament at its first sitting starting on April 2, less than a week after the election. The opposition suspects this is another Mitterrand trap to unsettle the new government. Others believe it is no more than a struggle for personal power. Mr Mitterrand's approach to the first cohabitation government - to preserve essential policies and prepare for the next presidential election - has given way to 'a strategy of personal convenience,' writes Jean-Marie Colombani, Le Monde's political editor. In practice, the end of the succession of Socialist governments going back to 1981 will mean little change to daily life. For one thing, the leadership of the right holds almost the same policies as the Socialists on most of the big issues of the day, including the need to defend the franc, on foreign policy, privatisation and on employment. The election would be lost on the Socialists' battered image and personalities, rather than on ideas. Differences within the right on some issues, like the strong franc, are far greater than between the leaderships of the right and of the Socialists. Furthermore, the right's expected majority would be so large that it would be under no obvious pressure to change, barring a serious revolution within the ranks. Much of what happens next in Mr Mitterrand's constitutional power struggle will depend on the skill of the next prime minister in weaving his way round the right's internal splits and the president's tactics. Here Mr Mitterrand holds an important advantage, for only he has the right to choose the prime minister, who then has to carry out an uncomfortable balancing act between running the government competently and not overshadowing the president. 'He must not fail, otherwise he runs the risk of being sacked ..still more he must not succeed, for to do so would be the ultimate impertinence,' the satirical newspaper Canard Enchaine once wrote.* Mr Edouard Balladur, a former RPR finance minister, who masterminded policy in the last cohabitation government, is hotly tipped for the job. Mr Jacques Chirac, the RPR leader and former prime minister, does not want to stand again because he has presidential ambitions. Mr Balladur has kept aloof enough from the fray to be able to work with Mr Mitterrand. In the end, the leader of the next right government depends on Mr Mitterrand's private instincts - and they will remain private until he alone decides the time is right. *The Government and Politics of France by Vincent Wright. 3rd ed.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A press source at the Embassy of Palestine has said  that the Egyptian Embassy in Amman has started handing out forms  to be filled by evacuees from the Gaza Strip in order to carry  out a census.    This procedure is aimed at maintaining the evacuees' right  to  return to their homeland, their identity, as well as all their  acquired rights.    It should be noted that completing this form does not affect  the evacuee's right to residency, work, commercial activity, and  housing. For this purpose, Gazans should report to the Egyptian  Embassy in Amman.</p>

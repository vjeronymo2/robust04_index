			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / Russians may be without fuel soon: Republic's power stations using up reserve stocks of coal POWER stations in Russia, the world's biggest oil producer, are running out of fuel and may have to cut energy supplies to industry and the public, an official was quoted as saying yesterday, Reuter reports from Moscow. Mr Stanislav Rura, deputy chief engineer of the Far East Power Association, said coal shortages were to blame. 'We are faced with the real necessity of halting the supply of energy to industrial enterprises,' he told Tass news agency. 'The reason is the acute shortage of fuel. Miners in the Maritime Region (around Vladivostok) are not providing for the power-engineering workers' requirements, and there aren't any deliveries from other areas. 'Power stations are already using up reserve stocks of coal. Unless urgent measures are taken, the question of stopping the population's heat supply will also arise.' Many enterprises have been feeling the effects of a fall in Russian energy supplies for some time. Radio Russia said that Siberian oil extraction fell 50m tonnes to 305m in 1991. It quoted Mr Yury Lisovoy, deputy head of the Tyumen Regional Economic Affairs Board, as telling the Russian Information Agency production was expected to drop further in 1992. Soviet oil production, of which Russia accounts for about 90 per cent, fell to about 500m tonnes in 1991 from a 1988 peak of 624m. But Mr Lisovoy held out hopes that greater local control over locally-produced oil in the coming year would boost output. 'Experts say that all Tyumen's oil fields, with their worn-out and obsolete equipment, need modernising without delay,' the radio said. Russian President Boris Yeltsin was reported to have decreed that from 1992 the Tyumen region and its oil enterprises would control the sale of 20 per cent of its oil exports. Tass said northern Russian officials had halted unloading of nuclear fuel from decommissioned submarines from yesterday. 'It has emerged the military have been conducting ecologically dangerous operations without warning civil authorities or the public.'</p>

			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Gold struggles to stay above Dollars 370 THE GOLD market struggled to avoid a decisive fall below the psychologically-important Dollars 370-a-troy-ounce level this week. The price twice dipped below that level but the return of light physical buying interest helped it to close in London yesterday at Dollars 371.15 an ounce, down Dollars 3.45 on the week. Uncertainty following the volatile trading of the preceding Friday - when a Dollars 4.35 jump in the was followed by an equally sudden Dollars 3 fall - meant that buyers were few and far between on Monday. Having seen the market survive several tests of support at Dollars 372 an ounce on that day, however, the buyers returned on Tuesday. But they soon began to retreat in the face of strong resistance near the Dollars 376-an-ounce mark. Renewed falls on Wednesday and Thursday morning saw the Dollars 372 level established as a position of upside resistance, rather than of downside support, and that resistance continued to hold yesterday. Traders were not committing themselves about the probable direction of the next move, explaining that the market was so evenly poised that it could be easily moved quite sharply by either bullish or bearish developments. A further fall to Dollars 365 an ounce was not ruled out, but most thought the present period of consolidation would be followed by re-establishment of the uptrend. Platinum followed gold lower this week but palladium, its sister metal, put in another firm performance. Strong Japanese demand - the metal is at present relatively cheap in yen terms - and good industrial demand in North America and Europe helped palladium's price to rise by Dollars 3.25 on the week to a 38-month high of Dollars 127 an ounce. Copper this week lead a general decline in London Metal Exchange prices that was resisted only by aluminium. The exchange's flagship contract began with an attempt to consolidate following last Friday's late price collapse, which saw the three month's position relinquish Dollars 85 of the week's Dollars 145 advance, to finish at Dollars 1,855 a tonne for the three months delivery contract. But it could not be prevented from edging down into a lower trading range, and upside resistance was soon established about Dollars 10 below that level. On Thursday a peak of Dollars 1,867 was reached in response to overnight strength in the New York market. But there was no follow-through buying, either in London or in New York, and liquidation took the price back to Dollars 1,840 at the end of the day. Further selling yesterday morning took the three months position down further to Dollars 1,823 a tonne, but by the close it had steadied to Dollars 1,830 a tonne. Dealers blamed the continuing bearish supply/demand position for the market's renewed weakness. They noted that the latest rise in LME warehouse stocks had taken the total to 436,300 tonnes, the highest since September 1978. Sentiment in the zinc market was again undermined by copper's slide, together with the metal's own bearish chart patterns and fundamentals. An unbroken sequence of relatively modest daily declines added up to a Dollars 34 fall on the week for the three months position. Yesterday's closing quotation of Dollars 934.50 was a six-year low and dealers said that, with LME warehouse stocks moving ever higher and refined supply continuing to outstrip demand, the near term technical objective was Dollars 920 a tonne. Another big loser at the LME was nickel, which, despite the announcement of a substantial LME stocks fall yesterday, ended Dollars 175 down on the week for three months metal, at Dollars 5,617.50 a tonne. Lead lost most the the rally prompted last week by the announcement of further production cuts. The three months position closed yesterday at Pounds 267.75 a tonne, down Pounds 6 on the week. Bucking the trend was aluminium, which scored its third successive weekly gain. Investment fund and speculative buying helped the three months price to defy bouts of profit-taking and rise by Dollars 13.25 overall to Dollars 1,182.50 a tonne at yesterday's close, just below an earlier 12-week high. Dealers suggested that the market was still on course to test upside resistance at Dollars 1,200 a tonne. At the London Futures and Options Exchange traders drew little comfort from the progress made at a negotiating session in London towards agreeing a new producer/consumer agreement with price-stabilisation efforts based on production restraint. The market's main concern is about the bearish impact on prices of arrangements in any new pact for disposing of the International Cocoa Organisation's 232,000-tonne buffer stock. Meanwhile the London market remained lethargic, with modest gains in the first four days being mostly wiped out yesterday as prices were depressed by a rise in sterling and selling by a leading London trader. Coffee remained depressed following last week's breach of support at 60 US cents a lb in New York. At The London Future's and Options Exchange's robusta futures market repeated attempts to push nearby prices into the middle of the recent Dollars 900- to Dollars 950-a-tonne range were frustrated by lack of supporting fundamental factors. Prices were caught between roaster buying interest and producer selling, particularly from Brazil and Indonesia, dealers said. At yesterday's close the September position was quoted at Dollars 903 a tonne, down Dollars 15 on the week.  ------------------------------------ LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Monday's close) tonnes  ------------------------------------ Aluminium   +825 to 1,820,200 Copper    +7,200 to   436,300 Lead         -50 to   259,500 Nickel    -1,482 to    94,830 Zinc        +925 to   671,625 Tin         -150 to    19,950  ------------------------------------</p>

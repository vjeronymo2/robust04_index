It was the third consecutive record month and represents a 5 per cent rise on the previous record in October 1993. The continued volatility in European financial markets in November - especially in the UK and Italy - led to heavy trading and hedging activity during that month. On the French Matif futures and options exchange, trading volume in November totalled 6,514,508 contracts, an increase of 40 per cent over November 1992. In November also, some 471,703 Matif contracts were traded on Globex, the electronic trading system, representing 77 per cent of all Globex volume that month.</p>

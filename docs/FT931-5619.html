			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Congress may back deeper spending cuts: Clinton's deficit reduction plan CONGRESS may agree to proposals for as much as Dollars 5bn-Dollars 10bn in additional spending cuts next year to broaden support for the deficit-reduction plan presented by President Bill Clinton. Budget conservatives in the Democratic party will present a list of spending cuts totalling Dollars 83bn (Pounds 58.4bn) over five years, of which up to Dollars 60bn may win sufficient backing in Congress. Despite nervousness that the overall package might be jeopardised if too many cuts are added, the Clinton administration and the Democratic leadership in Congress have agreed to consider further measures. 'We are being asked to produce a list that is saleable,' said Congressman Timothy Penny of Minnesota, a leader of the Democratic group seeking further cuts. While deeper spending cuts may eventually win votes from some Republicans, Democrats are assuming that they cannot count on any Republican support as they assess likely backing for controversial cuts. Mr Clinton's plan, outlined last month, includes Dollars 247bn of spending cuts and Dollars 246bn of tax increases in 1994-97, but these are offset by Dollars 109bn of spending increases and Dollars 60bn of tax breaks. Overall, the package is projected by the White House to save a cumulative total of Dollars 473bn over five years in comparison with the current path of spending. But the Congressional Budget Office, in its own analysis of Mr Clinton's plan, calculates that his spending cuts will save about Dollars 21bn less than he projects over five years, and his tax increases will bring in Dollars 27bn less than he expects. One serious discrepancy concerns projected savings from the possibility that the Treasury could lower its net interest costs by selling more debt at shorter maturities, which the CBO declines to include in its estimates. The CBO's estimate of the deficit in 1997 is, however, almost identical to the Dollars 206bn projected by the White House, because it is more optimistic about revenues from taxes unchanged by the Clinton plan. Nevertheless, many Democrats in Congress believe voters will be watching closely to see if the bill they pass matches the Dollars 473bn in deficit reduction promised by the Clinton plan. The CBO numbers may, therefore, strengthen the hand of those advocating further cuts. 'I think it helps our cause. At the very least they need to come to our list of cuts to fill the hole,' said Mr Penny. Congressman John Kasich of Ohio, the senior Republican on the House Budget Committee, also aims to match President Clinton's Dollars 473bn deficit reduction in his own plan, but to do so without raising any taxes. This is expected to involve around Dollars 400bn in spending cuts and some Dollars 75bn in user fees and interest savings. Republicans do not expect, however, that they will be able to do much to stop the Democratic majority from passing a budget resolution that broadly parallels the Clinton programme. This resolution, including only the broad outlines of spending, is expected to be taken up by the House Budget Committee next Wednesday, and could come to the floor of the House for a vote the following week. The hardest congressional battle is likely to come when each individual spending cut and tax measure comes in for scrutiny in a fuller budget reconciliation bill.</p>

			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Heart of England members hope for bonus bonanza - But suitor from Scotland might not have quite enough money for the dowry FOR YEARS, investors have been trying to spot building societies which might be taken over by outsiders and end up paying substantial cash bonuses to their members. Last month, it emerged that Heart of England, the 25th-biggest society with assets of Pounds 1.01bn, was negotiating with Bank of Edinburgh, a retail financial services group, about a friendly takeover. Once terms for the deal are agreed - something which seems still to be some way off - the 200,000 Heart of England members may be in for a bonus which could set a precedent for the entire industry. To understand what is at stake, you must remember that this is not like a takeover between companies. Building societies are owned not by shareholders but by their members. If a society decides to shed mutual ownership, it can be done only through a vote by members at an extraordinary general meeting. The criteria for approval are quite stiff: in a building society flotation, like that of Abbey National in 1989, 20 per cent of savers had to vote and a 75 per cent vote in favour was required. A simple majority is needed from borrowers who vote. When it comes to a takeover, the voting requirements are much higher. At least half the savers in the target society must vote, and more than three-quarters of those who do must be in favour of the change. Alternatively, savers with 90 per cent of the savings held in the society must vote in favour. It is a stiff test and, until April 1989, no one had any idea of how easy it would be to get past it. The resounding vote that month by Abbey National members in favour of shedding building society status transformed the picture completely. Of the 5.5m members eligible to vote, 3.1m (or 62 per cent) did so, with 89 per cent of savers and 90 per cent of borrowers in favour of the flotation. That suggests that the voting hurdle should be easy to exceed. But, of course, it depends in part on what incentives are offered to members. Abbey's were offered Pounds 100 worth of free shares, worth Pounds 140 at the time of the float although they rose rapidly in value once trading began: this week, they would have been worth Pounds 313. Since members of a society being taken over are, in effect, giving away ownership of their shares, it has normally been assumed that they would get generous cash handouts. So, are Heart of England members in for a bonanza? I fear not. Bank of Edinburgh is capitalised at Pounds 26m, and a quick calculation suggests it cannot pay 200,000 members even Pounds 140 each. Perhaps the Scottish investors who back it will be willing to put up more cash to finance the purchase. But their resources are unlikely to be unlimited and, apart from paying a bonus to Heart of England savers, the bank also needs to inject new capital into the society and keep some money ready for further possible acquisitions. If the investors do not stump up, Bank of Edinburgh might have to consider mixing some cash for members along with an offer of new shares. Incidentally, the bank need not hand out the bonus on a flat-rate base: it could decide to pay investors in proportion to the amount of cash they had with the society on a qualifying date, and hope to attract the backing of savers controlling 90 per cent of its funds. The trouble is that Bank of Edinburgh shares are not at present traded on the stock exchange. Even if they were, they are a much less attractive investment than Abbey National shares were in 1988. It remains to be seen whether savers will vote for this sort of deal which, frankly, would be a much less glittering offer than that made to Abbey National members. Is now the time to put money into the Heart of England? If the takeover date goes ahead, a qualifying date will be set. It might have passed already, but not necessarily so. (Abbey National announced its flotation plans in April 1988 and set a qualifying date of December 31 that same year). Members who were not entitled to vote - children, for example - did particularly well out of the compensation offered. Some investors prefer to try to identify the society which will be next in line for a takeover after Heart of England - not an easy task, because plans can change. National &amp; Provincial planned a stock market flotation in 1989 but had to pull out. But societies which might be plausible targets for a takeover include Norwich &amp; Peterborough, Chelsea, North of England, West Bromwich, Stroud &amp; Swindon and perhaps the Portman. All combine fairly large branch networks with strong regional customer bases which might be attractive to a bank. Even if no predators emerge from outside the industry for them, they would be natural candidates for mergers with a larger society. If any of them remains independent in 10 years' time, it will have cause to congratulate itself.</p>

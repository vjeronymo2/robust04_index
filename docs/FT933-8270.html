			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / People: Irish Life loses Edmondson to JRIA John Edmondson, the general manager for development at Irish Life, Ireland's largest life assurance, pensions and investment group, has been appointed as finance director to J. Rothschild International Assurance (JRIA) in Dublin. JRIA was set up in Dublin's International Financial Services Centre in January this year to market life assurance products into Europe on behalf of banks and financial institutions. The 44-year-old Edmondson speaks fluent Russian and has worked with Irish Life for 21 years, working initially in the pensions area of its business and moving up to become the executive in charge of developing its European operations at the end of the 1980s, reporting to David Kingston the group managing director. In 1990, Irish Life acquired a majority stake in David, a Norwegian life assurance and pensions company which sells individual pensions products through savings banks in Norway. It is planning to introduce unit-linked products to the Norwegian market in due course. Also under Edmondson's direction, Irish Life set up a new insurance operation Xaar, in France in 1992, primarily writing motor and general insurance policies, but is adding on individual life products. Edmondson will take up his new appointment next month, and will have responsibility for the financial and actuarial aspects of JRIA's activities.</p>

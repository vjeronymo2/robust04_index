			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Company News (This Week): Colonia - Other Companies Tomorrow morning Mr Class Kleybolt, chief executive of Colonia, will unveil what are expected to be healthy increases in profits and earnings per share at Germany's third largest insurance group. As indicated at the half-year stage, Colonia has benefited primarily from improved results in the mainstream 'technical insurance' area. Mr Kleybolt is also likely to spell out more details of the restructuring plans which he first unveiled last autumn, although it is too early for these figures to have had much of an impact on earnings. In 1992, Colonia, which is now part of the French Union des Assurances de Paris, made net profits of DM110m (Dollars 65.8m) on premium income of DM12.17bn.</p>

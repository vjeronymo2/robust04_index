			<p>BFN     [Text] After it was confirmed that Belizean troops had  entered Guatemalan territory, yesterday, Army spokesperson Major  Edith Vargas de Marroquin reported that the Army is prepared to  defend the country militarily. Nevertheless, Vargas said this  problem must first be solved politically and that the Guatemalan  Foreign Ministry has started to take specific actions to this  end. "The defense minister visited the area and listened to the  local residents' complaints and fears. He told them the Army is  prepared to defend them, as it is its responsibility," she said.    According to the Army's official version, the problem is  that  there is no definite border between Guatemala and Belize. This  has not led to an armed confrontation between the two armies,  however, the source said. Maj. Vargas reported that the  Guatemalan and Belizean troops stationed along the border area  hold "peaceful" relations and avoid incidents.    It has been reported from Peten that combined British and  Belizean troops continue to harass and intimidate hundreds of  peasant families living in the area. The source added that  these two armies have used sophisticated equipment, such as the  Harrier plane, specially designed for heavy fighting.    On Tuesday, the peasants intimidated by these actions  presented to the Human Rights Ombudsman's Office a petition  reporting that foreign troops had entered their communities to  evict them and seize their property. Sebastian Tux, leader of  the affected communities, told this newspaper that Belizean  soldiers arrived at their homes and ordered them to leave  because the territory belonged to Belize.</p>

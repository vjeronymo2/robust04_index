			<p><P> January 22, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> DREYFUSS' FAME IS 'RIGHT SIZE'  </P> <P> Two decades of movie-making have left Richard Dreyfuss at a comfortable level  of fame.  </P> <P> "I have the right-size celebrity," the 42-year-old actor said in February's  Fame magazine. "Not as much as some and a lot more than others. And I'm known  but not worshiped.  </P> <P> "I can always get a good table at a restaurant, but when I get to the table,  they let me eat in peace," said Dreyfuss, star of the current film "Always."  </P> <P> In the 1970s, Dreyfuss starred in such blockbusters as "American Graffiti,"  "Jaws" and "Close Encounters of the Third Kind," and won an Academy Award for  "The Goodbye Girl."  </P></p>

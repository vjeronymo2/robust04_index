			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Wan Chengcai (8001 2052 2088) and Cui Shaochun </F> (1508 1421 4783)]    [Text] Moscow, 28 Jun (XINHUA) -- On 28 June, Qian Qichen,  vice premier and foreign minister, held talks with his Russian  counterpart Kozyrev at the Foreign Affairs Villa in Moscow.  Both sides exchanged views on Sino-Russian bilateral relations  and other issues of common concern and discussed relevant  questions in connection with President Jiang Zemin's visit to  Russia.    Qian Qichen said that he was very happy to have another  opportunity to visit Russia, a friendly neighbor. He said: The  main purpose of my current visit to Moscow is to make  preparations for Chinese President Jiang Zemin's visit to Russia  this fall. The upcoming visit by President Jiang Zemin is a  reciprocal visit following President Yeltsin's visit to China in  December 1992. Because it is a great event in the relations  between the two countries, it is necessary to make earnest  preparations to ensure the success of the visit.    Qian Qichen said: China and Russia are neighbors. The  maintenance of the long-term, stable, good-neighbor relationship  between them is not only very important to the people of China  and Russia but also concerns peace, stability, and development  in the Asia-Pacific region and in the world as a whole.    Qian Qichen said that over the past two years since China  and  Russia established diplomatic relations, bilateral relations in  the political and economic spheres and other fields have  developed steadily. High-level exchanges between the two  countries have increased. Foreign Minister Kozyrev visited  China early this year. In May, Russian State Duma Speaker Rybkin  and Russian Prime Minister Chernomyrdin successively visited  China by invitation. The Chinese side is satisfied with the  development of bilateral relations in recent years and  reiterates that it will strictly observe the principles of the  18 December 1992 joint declaration on Sino-Russian relations.    Qian Qichen stressed that the Chinese side values very much  the hard-won, good-neighbor relations between China and Russia.  China is willing to strengthen and expand bilateral cooperation  in various fields on the basis of the Five Principles of  Peaceful Coexistence and of the Sino-Russian joint declaration.    Touching on Russia's joining NATO's "Partnership for Peace"  program, Qian Qichen said: In recent years, a great change has  taken place in the situation in Europe. It is understandable  that European countries are concerned about their own security.  We hope that every arrangement for security in Europe can be in  accord with not only the wishes and interests of the nations  concerned but also with international security, peace, and  stability. He said that the idea and practice of forming a  military bloc against a certain country in the time of the "Cold  War" are now outdated and should be discarded.    Kozyrev said that the Russian side attaches great importance  to President Jiang Zemin's visit to Russia this fall and that it  believes the visit will be of profound and far-reaching  significance in expanding bilateral friendly relations and  cooperation. Together with the Chinese side, the Russian side  will work hard for the success of President Jiang Zemin's visit  to Russia.    Kozyrev said: As for Russia's joining NATO's "Partnership  for Peace" program, Russia has also suggested that NATO  transform itself into a new international organization in the  new situation following the end of the "Cold War." Russia will  not join any political or military bloc, whether in the East or  the West, which is directed at a certain country. He said that  Russia attaches great importance to Russian-Sino relations,  which, it deems, are as important as those between Russia and  NATO.    Both sides also exchanged views on the situation on the  Korean peninsula and on other international issues.    Present at the talks were Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Dai  Bingguo, Chinese Ambassador to Russia Wang Jinqing, Russian Vice  Foreign Minister Panov, and Russian Ambassador to China Rogachev.</p>

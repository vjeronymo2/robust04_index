			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Survey of Angola (8): Lack of funds curbs plans - Benguela railway DOWN at the Lobito repair workshop, engineers are diligently patching up locomotives damaged by bombs during the civil war. Along a short siding, engines that have been too badly hit are gradually stripped of any parts or equipment that can be used to repair others. Mr Ernesto da Rocha, chief engineer at the workshop, says that 12 General Electric locomotives, seven from the US and five from Brazil, are now in working order. Four more are being repaired and another five await their turn. Ten locomotives were too severely damaged to offer any scope for repair - causing an estimated loss of Dollars 18m. Mr da Rocha hopes to have 14 locomotives in good running condition by June. The rehabilitation of each engine is a painstaking task but one on which depends the future of the Caminho de Ferro de Benguela (CFB), once regarded by enthusiasts as one of the world's last great railways. For Angola, the line that runs eastwards from the Atlantic port of Lobito, 500km south of Luanda, to Zaire and the central African heartlands was a cause for pride and an important source of foreign exchange revenues until the civil war Between 1972 and 1974, total freight traffic on the railway averaged about 3m tonnes annually, including mineral exports of 535,000 tonnes from Zaire and of 325,000 tonnes from Zambia. Import traffic to the two countries was an average 550,000 tonnes annually. Total revenue peaked at Dollars 43m in 1974. Regular international services allowed passengers arriving at Lobito by ship from Europe to travel in comfort all the way to Lumbumbashi, formerly Elisabethville, in Zaire, or to Lusaka, the Zambian capital. The trains had sleeping accommodation and showers in first class and a restaurant that offered smoked ham and melon, Portuguese salt cod and Angolan giant prawns. Now that peace has been signed, officials hope that the railway will be restored, if not to its former status as a vital artery for central and southern African trade, at least sufficiently to play a crucial role in the recovery of Angola's internal provinces. But even this more modest objective will be difficult to achieve. The 1,300km line to Luau on the border with Zaire has been considerably damaged by war and 16 years of neglect. Apart from a few brief intervals, the line has been effectively closed to international traffic since the onset of the civil war in 1975, with intermittent freight services to Huambo, 400km away, until 1988. Thereafter, trains only run on the 30km coastal stretch between Lobito and Benguela, the provincial capital, to provide a primitive if regular passenger service. Irregular traffic between Lobito and Huambo resumed last year, but only for freight. Work has been going on to rehabilitate this part of the line and Mr Lukoki Sebastiao, BFB finance director, says he expects trains to resume normal traffic to Ganda, about half way to Huambo, by the end of May. Further east, the extent of the damage has yet to be fully assessed. Initial surveys, incomplete because many parts of the line are still inaccessible, suggest the track is in a very bad state with wood rail sleepers burnt or worn out and at least 75 bridges needing repair, he says. Lack of funds is a big handicap in efforts to rehabilitate the railway and several plans have had to be shelved or cut back as a result. In 1987, the government and the Southern Africa Development Co-ordination Conference (SADCC) agreed on an ambitious 10-year 'Lobito corridor' development plan which included rehabilitating the railway, improving adjacent infrastructures including roads, sanitation, sewerage, water and electricity supplies, repairing Lobito's port, and developing civil aviation facilities from the local airforce school airport. The cost was estimated at Dollars 575m at 1987 prices with Dollars 346m for the railway alone. Efforts to win international financing for the plan floundered because of the war and in 1989 a new emergency plan was dawn up. This focused on the link to Huambo and would have cost Dollars 94m with Dollars 33m to be spent on the railway, Mr Sebastiao says. This plan has now been replaced with a crash programme - aimed at restoring traffic between Lobito and Kuito, 584km east, at an estimated cost of Dollars 17m - to carry out partial repairs allowing the track to be fully operational (up to Kuito) in 1995. The rehabilitation of the rest of the line to the border will take place in a second stage, depending on the outcome of discussions with the World Bank later this year. Under World Bank auspices, work on a new comprehensive study of the Lobito Corridor began last January and is expected to be completed in July. Before that, discussions will take place with Zaire and Zambia to assess the railway's prospects. It is unlikely that the railway will ever be fully restored to its past glory, but even a partial restoration would play an important role in helping to rebuild Angola.</p>

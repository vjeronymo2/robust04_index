			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Building orders show fall on year THE RECESSION in the construction industry is tightening rather than slackening its grip, according to government figures published yesterday. The Environment Department said that construction orders won by British contractors fell 16 per cent during the three months to the end of July compared with the corresponding period last year. Private-sector orders by industry and commerce were among the worst affected. Private industrial orders were 26 per cent lower than in the corresponding period a year before, while private commercial orders, mainly for offices and shops, were 22 per cent lower. Private housing orders on the same basis were 15 per cent lower. However, public housing orders, including those from housing associations, were 24 per cent higher than in the corresponding period.</p>

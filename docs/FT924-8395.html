			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: SG Warburg Warburg's claim to merchant banking excellence suddenly looks a little hollow. Some fall in first half profits was to be expected, given the difficult market environment. What comes as a surprise is that the bank has pulled out of German leasing at a cost of Pounds 12m, only three years after it went in. Warburg now sheepishly admits that its original decision to enter the business was mistaken. Similarly the loss of perhaps Pounds 10m in the bond market upheavals of May and September seems uncharacteristically careless for an institution of such professional pretension. Warburg's problems go beyond the cycle. One explanation may be that its UK market share has peaked, while it has still not reached critical mass in the international arena. The bank denies rumours it was ever talking to JP Morgan. But some international partnership might be a good idea, since expanding internationally alone is either slow if attempted organically or expensive if done by acquisition. If the temptation is to take greater risks on its own account, as Warburg seems to have done in both leasing and bonds, justifiable doubts about the quality of its earnings can be raised. Supporters would say Warburg's undeniably strong position in the UK market gives it the flavour of a recovery stock. Mercury Asset Management is also a strong performer, especially after adjusting its Pounds 35m profit for the one-off Pounds 4m charge against Isosceles. But MAM's result only serves to underline Warburg's own recent lack of achievement in investment banking. Its shares may not easily recoup yesterday's 9 per cent fall.</p>

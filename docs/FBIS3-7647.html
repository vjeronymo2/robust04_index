			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Yi Chang-sop] </F>   [Text] From next month, American investors will be able to  trade Korean stocks in the United States by investing in  depositary receipts (DRs), which are negotiable certificates of  publicly traded shares on the Seoul stock exchange, the Ministry  of Finance said.    The MOF [Ministry of Finance] permitted 250 blue chip  companies out of 699 listed on the Korea Stock Exchange to issue  to Americans the dollar-denominated DRs, taking the already --  circulating issues as security.    With the U.S. trading of the Korean DRs, American investors  will not need to bother to register with Korean regulators, get  an identification card (ID) here and directly invest in Korean  stocks on the Korea Stock Exchange even at the risk of currency  fluctuation, the MOF said.    The DRs traded in the United States are the same as their  underlying stocks traded in Korea, except for the fact that DRs  are certificates of home-country stocks. Thus dual prices for  the single company issue may exist following the government  permission of DRs in the United States.    One major difference is that DRs are denominated in dollars  and traded outside Korea but their underlying stocks are traded  in Korean won on the Korea Stock Exchange. Holders of DRs can  not exercise voting rights.    Thus, Korean blue chip issues can be traded both in Korea  and  the United States, which will help local companies enhance their  image and understanding of their products and services overseas.    The DR issuance does not involve capital inflow into Korea.  It helps foreigners holding Korean stocks liquidate their  holding by issuing DRs to American investors in the United  States.    The MOF said local companies will be able to issue DRs  within  10 percent of their outstanding issues, in keeping with the  nation's 10 percent foreign ownership ceiling of individual  issues.    It said in line with the expansion of the foreign stock  ownership ceiling, the government will raise the DR issuance  quota, the MOF said.    To bypass cumbersome disclosure and registration  requirements  in the United States, Korean firms will initially issue DRs  outside the U.S. stock exchanges, meaning the trading of Korean  DRs in the Over- the-Counter (OTC) market.    But if DR issuers meet the U.S. disclosure and accounting  rules, these Korean companies can list their DRs on the U.S.  stock exchanges.    The MOF said three major U.S. banks -- Bank of New York,  Citibank and Morgan Guaranty Bank -- monopolize the DR issuance  processing.    Since the middle of the 1980s, a selected number of Korean  companies have issued DRs in major foreign capital markets when  they "newly" issued equities. When DRs are issued at the time  of new share offering, the issuers can raise fresh capital from  foreigners. But Korean companies have been prohibited from  issuing DRs on the back of "old" issues now circulating in the  domestic stock market.    DRs are created when U.S. brokers buy the Korean company's  shares in Seoul and deliver those shares to the Korea Securities  Settlement Corp. (KSSC), the custodian bank, which then  instructs the depositary bank (Bank of New York or Citibank) in  Seoul to issue DRs to the U.S. investors.    These DRs are freely traded just as any other U.S. stock.  They are priced and quoted in U.S. dollars, are traded on  either an exchange or the Over-the-Counter (OTC) market and  settled according to U.S. standards, a Bank of New York official  in Seoul said.    MOF's Securities Policy Division Director Sin Tong-kyu said  the government restricted the number of DR issuers to one-third  of all listed companies in Korea because it does not want to  spoil Korea's image when unknown small companies go bankrupt.    Eligible DR issuers are those with net worth of more than 20  billion won or paid-in capital of 10 billion won, the MOF said.</p>

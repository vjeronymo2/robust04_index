			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Germany tries to force the pace over VAT: Bonn has bit between its teeth More than any other group of industrialists in the European Union, the German business community dislikes intensely the current arrangements for collecting value added tax across the single market. The system, introduced a year and a half ago when frontier controls between the 12 member states were dropped, requires companies to do the paperwork once carried out by customs, filing trade returns to domestic tax authorities so that they can keep track of VAT payments. As far as Germany is concerned, it is a burden on industry that should be changed at the earliest possible opportunity. For this reason, Germany has thrust VAT arrangements to the forefront of its presidency in an effort to ensure that the EU remains on schedule for a switch to the so-called 'definitive regime' of VAT on January 1, 1997. Under this system VAT will be levied at the rate applicable in the country from which the goods originate rather than at the rate applicable in the country where they are sold. The big advantage for business is that traders will no longer need to differentiate between domestic and intra-Union sales. Germany's eagerness has to be reckoned with. But when economics and finance ministers meet in Brussels today for a meeting devoted entirely to tax, Mr Theo Waigel, German finance minister, is unlikely to find his enthusiasm matched by his counterparts. Brussels has yet to produce its proposals on introducing the definitive regime. German nagging has persuaded it to bring forward the publication date to October, but meanwhile, the once reviled transitional arrangements are settling down. There is also a growing feeling among business leaders and tax officials that it would be unwise to impose an entirely new system before the faults of the earlier one have been properly identified. As Unice, the European confederation of industry put it: 'Due caution should be exercised before moving to another system as the wrong choice would involve European business in a substantial opportunity cost.' Mrs Christiane Scrivener, commissioner in charge of indirect taxation, fears that by pressing ministers to discuss the subject before any definite proposals are on the table, the Germans might create confrontation and problems. She favours a more consultative approach - putting all the pieces of the puzzle on the table, as she puts it, before sitting down to put it together. Formulating proposals acceptable to all member states will be difficult. The country of origin system throws up two conundrums. First, such a regime needs to be accompanied by a clearing house system to redistribute revenue around the Union. Without one, countries exporting a lot of goods would benefit enormously, while high-import nations would lose. The clearing house system is thus viewed with considerable mistrust by states which fear they would not be justly recompensed. Second, the origin-based system requires a far greater degree of harmonisation of VAT rates. But countries like Britain do not want to sacrifice zero-rating on categories such as children's clothes and oppose uniform rates strongly. Market forces might be allowed to play their part in harmonising rates, but some of the poorer countries argue that this would be unfair until there is a greater degree of economic convergence. Not content with keeping this complex and unpopular subject in the limelight, the Germans today will also be raising the subject of a uniform withholding tax. They want a common, European tax on savings, putting an end to the huge flight of D-Marks from Germany, where there is a high tax on savings, to Luxembourg, where there is none. Luxembourg and Britain vehemently oppose such a move, arguing that it would lead to damaging capital outflows from the EU to other tax havens such as Switzerland. Mrs Scrivener is diplomatic: 'Germany is hoping to advance thought on the matter,' she says. 'They want us to talk about it because they think perhaps this could lead to new ideas.' Perhaps the only area where the Germans can hope to make progress is on energy taxes. It is suggesting that a straightforward energy tax should be abandoned in favour of increased excise duties on mineral oils. Some member states have already indicated that this approach is more likely to lead to a consensus on how best to meet commitments to stabilise carbon dioxide emissions by the end of the century. Quite how many countries are in favour will emerge at today's meeting. Here at least, the Germans, working in tandem with the French (who occupy the presidency of the Union after the Germans) might see some advance.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Members of the government and representatives of  coalition political entities met at the Slovak Government office  in Bratislava this afternoon. The session was chaired by Prime  Minister Jozef Moravcik. The talks resulted in the signing of a  coalition agreement between the Party of the Democratic Left,  the Christian Democratic Movement, and the so-called Centrist  Bloc.    Immediately after the agreement was signed, Ivan Bielko  interviewed Slovak Deputy Prime Minister Roman Kovac.    [begin recording] [Kovac] The coalition agreement makes  possible the functioning of the coalition government and its  lasting support in parliament for the measures it takes to lead  this society toward early democratic elections. A lot of work  will have to be done, naturally. The state cannot come to a  halt, and the coalition agreement safeguards the mechanisms to  enable the coalition parties to achieve constructive cooperation.    [Bielko] This coalition agreement was signed by five  entities. What will happen if one of them does not agree? How  will decisions be adopted?    [Kovac] It has been defined that these decisions must be  adopted by a consensus of all parties. That means that  disagreement of one party is being replaced by a dialogue.  Explanations and, truly, the problems that have to be tackled  must be solved by consensus. No system of voting has been  introduced. It would not be very good. We will re-assess the  entire situation. In case there is a negative attitude, we will  convene an extraordinary coalition council in order to solve the  problems. [end recording]</p>

			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Press body lay members angered by Calcutt LAY MEMBERS of the Press Complaints Commission yesterday expressed outrage that their independence had apparently been called into question by Sir David Calcutt's review of self-regulation of the press. The Calcutt report described the commission as 'the creature of the newspaper industry', and said that it could not fairly hold the balance between the individual and the press. Lady Elizabeth Cavendish, former chairman of the Inner London Juvenile Courts and a founding member of the commission, said yesterday: 'I think it is highly offensive to suggest we are a creature of the newspaper industry. This is the most independent body in the country.' Lady Cavendish said she could not remember a single occasion when commission members had been split along newspaper industry-lay member lines. Lord Colnbrook, formerly Mr Humphrey Atkins, a former Conservative minister, said: 'All the lay members of the PCC are totally independent. I'm retired now and I don't give a damn about what the press think of me.' He said he believed that Sir David's assessment that the commission and self-regulation had not worked had been 'strongly coloured by the fact the government didn't carry out all the things he recommended'. Lord Colnbrook said Sir David had not been to see the commission at work. Lay members say Sir David had lunch with them, but did not ask questions about how they approached their task and declined an invitation to stay to watch an adjudication session. The lay members are outnumbered by those with newspaper connections on the commission. They include Dame Mary Donaldson, a former Lord Mayor of London, Professor Lesley Rees, dean of Saint Bartholomew's Hospital Medical College in London, and Professor Robert Pinker, professor of social work studies at the London School of Economics. Sir David Chipp, a former editor-in-chief of the Press Association, said yesterday that he was 'very cross indeed' about any questioning of his independence. Meanwhile, lawyers were starting to highlight the practical difficulties of implementing privacy measures, particularly restraining publication, throughout the UK. 'There is a perennial difficulty in getting injunctions enforceable throughout the UK,' said Mr Michael Smith, a media specialist and partner at law firm Clifford Chance. The Calcutt proposals are aimed at least initially only at England and Wales. Northern Ireland is not mentioned. 'A prominent figure could be 'doorstepped' unlawfully in London but 'doorstepped' in exactly the the same way in Belfast perfectly legally,' Mr Smith said.</p>

			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Management: Absent without leave - Nigel Nicholson examines ways of encouraging employee attendance in the workplace When it comes to absenteeism, is Britain in a poor state of health? A report published this month by the Industrial Society suggests that it is, describing how Japanese-owned businesses in the UK outperform British companies in attendance rates. The report attributes this to better monitoring and internal communications and to Japanese companies' emphasis on teamwork. Absence rates in Britain have been falling over recent decades, partly reflecting better management and healthier workforces. But the cost in terms of lost production is still large. Could this be reduced further? People cannot be expected to fall sick only at weekends or during holidays. Moreover, one worker's time off for flu is another's escape from infection. It could be argued that tolerance of reasonable absenteeism - even allowing workers occasional mental health days - is a goodwill investment and an insurance against abuse. This depends upon a high degree of trust and shared awareness between employers and staff. On this count, British companies do not score highly. Absence is, for many, a forgotten problem. Records are rudimentary, communication of attendance data is negligible and control measures are crude and ill-focused. For these reasons, getting a grip on absenteeism can yield substantial savings. The first step is to ensure that records are accurate and informative, counting not just crude percentage time lost but also the number of separate absence spells. There is a world of difference when it comes to corporate efficiency between one worker being absent for five working days and five workers each taking one day off: most firms' records are incapable of making the distinction. Simple computerised recording systems are widely available which can provide this and other breakdowns. The second step is to raise awareness of absence levels across the firm. Absence has too often been seen as a personnel rather than an operations issue and line management should have responsibility for monitoring individual behaviour and achieving improvements. There is a need for attendance to be seen by everyone as a dimension of performance. The third step is to provide attendance incentives. Most corporate thinking about this is limited to a carrot and stick philosophy, often forgetting the carrot. The stick is discipline. But this can backfire, as in the case of the company which cracked down on offenders but lacked the means of discriminating between the unfortunate and the culpable. Although it managed to cut off the peak of worst offenders, aggregate absence levels rose. The disciplinary policy netted several who felt unfairly penalised, and the result was that absence levels for many rose to just below the level at which sanctions kicked in. Management had declared the rules of the game and the employees were playing it accordingly. If the stick does not work, what about the carrot? Most companies immediately think this means material rewards. But this raises further problems. Management, quite understandably, is reluctant to give additional rewards for what staff are contractually obliged to do and experience shows the positive effects tend not to last. The incentive is rarely great enough to be compelling; it looks like rewarding luck rather than motivation if people are disqualified for unavoidable illness, and bonuses have a way of becoming assimilated as just another element of the package. Research shows the most effective and under-used incentive is almost costless. It is recognition. Good absence information systems raise awareness of attendance performance. The most effective disincentive here is a shared awareness of attributable costs and this is where the Japanese teamwork culture generates control. Attendance-motivated workers are found in companies where individuals are aware of how their absence affects group performance, with the implicit sanction of group disapproval for abuse. This is only likely to occur where groups are inter-dependent enough for individual behaviour to be visible. But how does this relate to illness and stress - cited in the Industrial Society report as prime causes of absenteeism? The two are connected. Employees are more liable to become ill when bored, unhappy and demotivated. Absence has two interacting causes: risk and susceptibility. For example, an unhealthy lifestyle is a risk factor, and low morale a susceptibility factor. The risk multiplied by susceptibility equation explains why young and low-status workers have the highest rates of absence. They are at risk through lifestyle and health factors, and are most susceptible through their lower attachment to work. The Industrial Society confirms the equation. The lowest absence occurs where risks are minimised through careful hiring policy and preventive health programmes, and susceptibility is minimised through trust. Absence is a lens through which poor management practice is magnified. The Japanese experience shows how the values of involvement and improvement challenge British management to new ways of managing employee performance.

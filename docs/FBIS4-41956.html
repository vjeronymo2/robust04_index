			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [by ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Anatoliy Krasnov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 28 Jun -- China and Russia do not want the  Korean peninsula to have nuclear wepons and are advocating a  peaceful resolution of all the issues connected with this. Nor  do they want any sanctions to be imposed on Korea, so as to  avoid making the situation more complex. This was stated today  by Qian Qichen, deputy premier of the State Council who is also  the foreign minister of the People's Republic of China, during  his visit to the Moscow State University named after M.B.  Lomonosov.    Replying to questions asked by the university lecturers  about  similarities and differences in the approaches of China and  Russia to the issue of the settlement of the nuclear problem on  the Korean peninsula, the head of the foreign policy department  of the People's Republic of China stressed that there are no  radical differences between Moscow's and Beijing's stands on  this issue.    "We understand Russia's proposal on convening a multilateral  international conference," Qian Qichen said. At the same time,  he said, the Chinese side believes that the nuclear problem in  the DPRK must be resolved within the framework of the dialogues  which currently exist between South Korea and North Korea,  between the DPRK and the United States, and between North Korea  and the International Atomic Energy Agency. The Chinese foreign  minister expressed the hope that the forthcoming round of talks  in Geneva between Pyongyang and Washington will open up new  opportunities to settle these problems.</p>

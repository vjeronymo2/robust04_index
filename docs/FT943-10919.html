			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: El Abra sale boosts profits of Chilean miner After-tax profits at Codelco, Chile's state copper giant, rose by 136 per cent during the first six months to Dollars 212.7m, although operational earnings fell by 11.2 per cent to Dollars 306.6m. The improved performance was largely due to the Dollars 330m received by Codelco after the sale of 51 per cent of the El Abra deposit to Cyprus Minerals of the US. Copper production at Codelco's four mines fell by 7 per cent on the same period last year to 531,900 tonnes, largely because of declining ore grades. The fall was offset by a marginal improvement in productivity which averaged 69.05 cents a pound and by a reduction in staff from 24,820 a year ago to 22,490. Chuquicamata, still the world's biggest copper mine, recorded costs of 64.7 cents a pound while Andina, the least efficient of Codelco's deposits, just nudged under 80 cents. Mr Juan Villarzu, the new Codelco president, bent on modernising the company, has targeted 60 cents a pound by the end of the decade. According to press reports, Mr Villarzu has persuaded the government to provide the Dollars 450m needed to develop the Radomiro Tomic. Development of a new, low-cost mine like Tomic is vital to the future of the company. However, there is great pressure for Codelco to follow the El Abra model, selling part of the deposit to the private sector.</p>

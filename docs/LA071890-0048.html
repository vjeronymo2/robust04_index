			<p><P> July 18, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CITING TROUBLES, SUPERVISORS SPLIT CORONER'S POST IN TWO;  </P> <P> SHAKE-UP: THE BOARD DECIDES THAT BOTH A PROFESSIONAL MANAGER AND A  PHYSICIAN-PATHOLOGIST ARE NEEDED TO GET THE JOB DONE.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County coroner's job is too tough for one person, according to  the Board of Supervisors, which voted Tuesday to split the tasks of running the  troubled office between a professional manager and a pathologist.  </P> <P> The shake-up was prompted by an audit that sharply criticized the management of  the office under former Chief Medical Examiner-Coroner Ronald Kornblum, who  resigned from the post in April.  </P> <P> Supervisors on Tuesday approved a nationwide search for a lay manager to  administer the coroner's office and a chief medical examiner-coroner to oversee  autopsies and other investigations into causes of death. The chief medical  examiner, by law, must be a physician.  </P> <P> "Currently, given the extent and nature of the demands made upon the office,  the chief medical examiner-coroner must have very high levels of both medical  and management abilities," said Richard B. Dixon, the county's chief  administrative officer, who recommended the restructuring.  </P> <P> "This combination is rarely found in one person. When it is found, it is likely  that either the medical or the management responsibilities will not receive the  full attention which they require."  </P> <P> The restructuring was opposed by the Los Angeles County Medical Assn., the Los  Angeles Society of Pathologists and the chief of Los Angeles County's forensic  medical division, as well as two national organizations representing medical  examiners and pathologists across the country.  </P> <P> During a public hearing last week, Dr. Brian D. Blackbourne, San Diego County's  medical examiner, told supervisors that placing a lay manager in charge of the  coroner's office "will not make the situation better, but instead will make it  much worse."  </P> <P> Blackbourne, representing the National Assn. of Medical Examiners and the  American Academy of Forensic Sciences, said the supervisors should leave a  pathologist in charge of the department and "commit the needed resources and  personnel so the job can be done as it needs to be done."  </P> <P> Dixon said the lay manager, who would be called director of the Department of  Coroner, and the chief medical examiner-coroner would be equals, and each would  report directly to the Board of Supervisors. Dixon said his recommendation is  designed to allow the chief medical examiner to devote his time exclusively to  the medical duties "and not be diverted by day-to-day housekeeping of the  department."  </P> <P> Supervisor Ed Edelman, who opposed the change, said it would create "conflict  and chaos" in the department.  </P> <P> He said it will be difficult to fix blame for problems. "Whom do we hold  responsible?" Edelman said. "The medical examiner is going to point to the  administrator, and the administrator is going to point to the medical examiner  when there is a problem."  </P> <P> R. Dennis Persons, president of the Los Angeles County Funeral Directors Assn.,  supported the restructuring. He pointed out that 53 of the 58 county coroner  offices in California are headed by administrators, often sheriffs.  </P> <P> As Los Angeles County coroner, Kornblum made no secret of the fact that he was  a pathologist first -- for which associates around the county gave him high  marks -- and an administrator only because he was forced to be one.  </P> <P> Kornblum directed a staff of 160 people who, in 1989, investigated 18,000  suspicious or violent deaths. More than 5,000 of those required autopsies by  the office's physicians.  </P> <P> Kornblum took over the office in 1982 when Dr. Thomas T. Noguchi, self-styled  "coroner to the stars," was accused of poor management and lost his job.  </P> <P> A management audit last April concluded that the growing number of homicides in  the county is overwhelming the coroner's office, leading to a breakdown in  controls, sanitary standards and protection of personal property. The 319-page  report made 155 recommendations.  </P> <P> The coroner's office was once headed by a non-physician. In 1956, voters  approved a County Charter amendment separating the coroner from the public  administrator's office and requiring the coroner to be a pathologist.  </P></p>

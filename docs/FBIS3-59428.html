			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Excerpt" from interview with Vladimir Lukic, prime </F> minister of the Serbian Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, by Momir  Brkic; place and date not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Brkic] You mentioned the rule of law. What  problems are you encountering? I am also referring to the  complaints that we are not effectively fighting against war  profiteering, not only in this region but also elsewhere.    [Lukic] Those who have not experienced a war cannot easily  understand all the byproducts of the war. We certainly have  things that people could hardly imagine in peace, let alone plan  them. Of course, in addition to the people's great patriotism,  the readiness of a large number of people, young and old, to  invest everything in their country and their people, there is  also a number of people who want to get rich through the war, to  make a profit, to avoid their patriotic obligations. Things  like that do exist.    However, I personally think that these people do not deserve  the attention that was given to them in the press, in the media.  I am convinced that there are fewer of them than alleged. On  the other hand, it is in fact them who are spreading the  stories, often about those who have nothing to do with war  profiteering, simply because they want to enlarge the circle of  such people and in this way shift the blame onto someone else.    I am convinced that they will be dealt with as soon as  society organizes itself a bit better, as soon as there is more  stable peace, or when peace is established. I would not pay too  much attention to those people. However, we must continue  preventing them and not allow them to carry out legal or any  other work. What is important in my view is that good  businessmen and all those who are carrying out business  activities in a correct way, and who are indeed helping our  struggle, should not be implicated in this. Therefore, war  profiteers must be put on the agenda, but they should not be the  main point of the agenda of our work today.</p>

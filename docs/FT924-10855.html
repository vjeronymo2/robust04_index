			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Gentle party chieftain pushed into limelight: Kanemaru's successor is no 'godfather' WHEN the position of 'godfather' became vacant in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), the gently-spoken Mr Keizo Obuchi was pushed forward by the political pack and found himself awarded with the title of Japan's Most Powerful Politician. Mr Obuchi may have taken the title from Mr Shin Kanemaru, who has just resigned, but he doesn't quite have the credentials to make the title stick. Japan's 'godfather' must be a bruiser, able to coerce the party's unruly factions into line, a tough backroom operator and a benefactor with enough favours distributed among underlings that he can rely on their devotion. Having gone to the right university, Waseda, and having followed his father into politics, Mr Obuchi, 55, had a headstart on the competition. But his unceasing service to Mr Noboru Takeshita, the former prime minister and another Waseda man, has left him without the personal power base necessary for a genuine 'godfather'. The shadow of Mr Takeshita has loomed large over the career of Mr Obuchi, who held the abacus when Mr Takeshita was reckoning whether he had the numbers to take control of the party's largest faction in 1987. It is part of Japanese political lore that the well-meaning Mr Obuchi was so impressed by a Waseda colleague's oratory skills that he taped one of his speeches and based his own first parliamentary speech, at age 26, on that of his colleague. That colleague was Mr Toshiki Kaifu, prime minister until late last year. While Mr Takeshita looms over Mr Obuchi, the shadow of scandal is looming over Mr Takeshita, and has its origins at the time he succeeded in wresting control of the faction from another genuine 'godfather', Mr Kakuei Tanaka, a former prime minister and a power within the party long after his resignation from that post in 1974. Outraged by the lack of loyalty shown to Mr Tanaka, an extreme-right group sent their sound vans into the streets for a noisy 'praising to death' campaign against Mr Takeshita, who was praised loud and often on the eve of an election. One embarrassing piece of praise was that 'we should elect Takeshita because he's very good at making money'. The skill of fund-raising is more important for a 'godfather' than a prime minister and, according to Japanese prosecutors, Mr Takeshita indirectly asked a gangster group to use its good offices to ensure that the right-wingers turned down the volume. At the parliamentary session to open tomorrow, Mr Takeshita is expected to be summoned to explain those gangster links, though his mastery of the double and triple negative should ensure that he survives the questioning with career intact. If Mr Takeshita falls, it is unlikely that Mr Obuchi will remain Japan's Most Powerful Politician, and an opening will be created for Mr Ichiro Ozawa, a former LDP secretary-general and an ally of Mr Kanemaru. With a friendship cemented by the marriage of their children, Mr Takeshita and Mr Kanemaru had formed a powerful alliance, but both wanted the leadership and Mr Kanemaru had the numbers. Meanwhile, the party's four other factions have rushed to support Mr Obuchi, recognising that he is unlikely to have the influence to push them around and fearing that Mr Ozawa has the charisma, the contacts and the fiscal skills required to make him a real 'godfather'.</p>

			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Construction prices forecast to rise 8% Construction prices are forecast to rise by 8 per cent during the next two years, casting 'doubt on the chancellor's assertion that falling prices will offset cuts in spending on roads and housing', says a survey published today. The survey, by the building-cost information service of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, says builders faced with rising material costs will be forced to increase prices. Its forecasts are based on analysis of tenders accepted for building schemes during the past three months. The findings fly in the face of the Mr Kenneth Clarke's assertion in the Budget that falling prices will enable the government to cut public spending without damaging construction programmes. Mr Christopher Vickers, a senior partner at quantity surveyors EC Harris and construction spokesman for the institution, said construction prices had fallen by a fifth since 1989. Building contractors could no longer afford to absorb rising material prices, and as a result were increasing tender prices. Prices of constructional steel, cement, concrete, plasterboard, engineering bricks and some types of glass have all risen this year and more increases are likely, say material producers. The institution says the knock-on effect will require contractors to raise prices by 2.5 per cent between the fourth quarter of this year and the fourth quarter of 1994. It says further increases in 1994-95 would push prices up by 8 per cent over two years. The value of new commissions won by architects fell by 5 per cent during the three months to the end of September compared with the previous quarter, says a survey by the Royal Institute of British Architects published today. The survey, which is a good guide to future order trends in the construction industry, says the fall was due partly to the ending of capital allowances for industrial building. None the less, the decline emphasised the 'fragility of the construction industry recovery'. New commissions to architects had risen in each of the two previous quarters. More architects (27 per cent) expected workloads to increase than those (21 per cent) expecting work to reduce. But the positive balance had fallen to 6 percentage points from 14 percentage points.</p>

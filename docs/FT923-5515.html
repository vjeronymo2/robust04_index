			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Baldwin deficit reduced to Pounds 2.02m Baldwin, the leisure, printing and property group, announced a reduced pre-tax loss of Pounds 2.02m for the six months to April 30. Last time there were losses of Pounds 2.23m. Turnover was little changed at Pounds 4.2m (Pounds 4.24m). The tour operating division, which accounts for two-thirds of group trading activities, only recognises revenue on the departure of clients on holiday. Hence there was little turnover from that source. The company has issued legal proceedings to protect the value of its holdings in London Clubs International and because of the uncertain value of that investment the directors feel unable to declare an interim dividend. Last time there was a 1.4p payment. They hope to pay a final of not less than the total 2.8p paid in 1991. Losses per share fell to 7.98p (8.98p).</p>

			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Briefcase Q&amp;A: Power of attorney I HAVE SIGNED a document giving me an enduring power of attorney over the affairs of an elderly aunt, although I have not yet taken up these duties. I am not clear regarding the legal and financial obligations of taking on this responsibility. Can a nephew be made legally responsible for an aunt's debts (eg, nursing home fees), and does accepting power of attorney change these responsibilities in any way? Until 1985, a power of attorney was revoked automatically when the donor became mentally incapacitated. By the Enduring Power of Attorney Act 1985, the creation of a power of attorney will survive the donor's subsequent incapacity. This, as we understand it, is the meaning of an enduring power of attorney. It does not mean that the power, once granted, can never be taken away; the donor of any power is at liberty to revoke that power at any time. The nature of a power is that it bestows on the donee the authority to deal with or dispose of property which belongs to another (in this case, your aunt). A power of attorney allows the donee to perform additional functions, such as the making of deeds and the conveying of land. As we understand the situation, the granting of a power of attorney does not make you, the donee, responsible in law for the liabilities of the donor (that is, your aunt). You might care to contact the Law Society to see if there is any literature available on this topic, but a brief consultation with a solicitor would probably help to clear up any outstanding queries or doubts you may have.

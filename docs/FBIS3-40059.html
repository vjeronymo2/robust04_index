			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Installment No 52 of Hong Kong Memoirs by Xu </F> Jiatun (6079 1367 1470), [former director of the Hong Kong  Office of the New China News Agency, China's unofficial embassy  in Hong Kong]: "A Storm About My Statement -- With the Support  of Figures, Such as Wan Li, It Did Not Cause a Great Storm in  Beijing, with Britain Finally Compromising, and Both Sides  Taking a Path of Cooperation"]    [Text] Various international news agencies also carried  reports, leading certain Japanese and French banks to ask  their Hong Kong connections to find and ask me in person: "What  is the problem between China and Britain?"    And a friend from press circles asked someone to pass on the  word to me that: "Your statement was too intense, being much  too damaging to your image!"    I received phone calls from certain friends, some telling me  about public and international reactions, some expressing  support, and yet others indirectly reflecting differing views,  making the well-meant suggestion that the future statements  should emphasize deportment. And I also received certain  "letters from the people," expressing support and encouragement.    Bao Yugang [0545 3768 0474] also sought me out to express  support: "While you have spoken very well, and it was about  time, certain Chinese as well as British friends also agree with  you." He also said that: "Good principles also say that you have  spoken well!"    Later, Jardine Matheson's Simon Kaise expressed to me  directly his dissatisfaction with the British Hong Kong  government's method of representative government, sympathizing  with my statement.    While I had expected differing stands and reactions, I had  never anticipated the reaction to my sense of propriety,  particularly to my deportment. So I learned my lesson, and  strove to prevent its recurrence on future public occasions.    This "storm about my statement" also aroused the attention  of  Beijing, with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) and the  [State Council] Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office (HKMAO)  sending me telegrams asking what I had said. My colleagues in  our branch of the NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY (NCNA) were quite tense,  wondering whether the inquiries meant that a mistake had been  made. So I reported the news record to the MOFA, the HKMAO,  the CPC Central Committee, and the State Council, as well as  consoling my colleagues that there was no need for concern, as  the matter had not been handled wrong. Even if it had and  Beijing criticized us, I was responsible, as "the statement was  mine."    The MOFA's diplomatic language of "considering both sides  and  speaking around the issue" was essentially noncommittal, showing  China's conflict in dealing with my statement. When the  British side criticized my statement at a meeting of the  Sino-British Joint Liaison Group, the Chinese side's chief  representative, Ke Zaishuo [2688 0961 3617], responded that this  was "unfair," differing from MOFA's tacit consent, and  stretching to convey China's position. I considered that he  might have used such a "neutral" term only because he either was  not obeying MOFA instructions, or had not received them (which  possibility was not great). I believe that he felt very awkward.    When Ji Pengfei [1213 7720 7378] [chairman of the Basic Law  Drafting Committee for the Hong Kong Special Administrative  Region, and director of the HKMAO] later visited Hong Kong, he  asked me: "What did you say at the time?" After I had told him,  he had nothing further to say. (In fact, his question was  unnecessary, as I had already reported by telegram, as well as  attaching the news account.) I knew that his view differed, so  did not discuss it further. And when a reporter asked him on a  public occasion his view on the "storm about my statement," he  did not take a stand. At a cocktail party given for him by  industrial and commercial circles, when Mauridge of the Hong  Kong Chamber of Commerce (generally known as the West's Chamber  of Commerce, as its members were mostly British merchants)  "complained" to him, criticizing my statement, Ji Pengfei  actually said nothing despite the fact that I was standing not  far from them, making me feel that he had gone a bit too far.  But at a luncheon after he had spoken with Hong Kong Governor  Wilson, when someone again mentioned the "storm about my notes,"  he finally made the statement that: "As it seems to have  motivated Britain to dovetail' with us, it did have an impact."    While Ji Pengfei was visiting Hong Kong, the news came from  Beijing that the "storm about my statement" had also set off a  "storm" in Beijing, with the MOFA and the HKMAO complaining  about me to the Central Committee and State Council, arousing  the attention of the Central Committee. At a meeting of the  CPC Central Committee Secretariat, Wan Li said that: "I have  read the whole text of Xu Jiatun's statement, and believe that  it contains no problems." So it seems that the support of  figures, such as Wan Li, kept the storm from blowing up in  Beijing.    At a meeting with Deng Xiaoping in the first half of 1986,  he  asked me: "Did you not make a statement that aroused  controversy?" While I did not know if he was referring to its  internal or external controversy, I said: "Yes. It caused much  trouble." Whereupon Deng said: "You were not wrong. If you had  not made that statement, allowing Britain to go on as it had,  Hong Kong would have certainly been thrown into chaos." State  Councilor Gu Mu was at that meeting with Deng. When I returned  to Hong Kong and discussed the matter with my NCNA colleagues  there, they suggested that: "You ought to write a report to  the MOFA and HKMAO, to let them know about this." While my  colleagues' idea was a very good one, I felt that it was  unnecessary, as I had always felt that I had done nothing wrong.    One month after the "storm about my statement," Britain  expressed acceptance of the principle that representative  government would be dovetailed with the Basic Law, even though  much mutual controversy still remained over the political system  issue. After this, in the course of the drafting of the Basic  Law, both sides entered a stage of cooperation.</p>

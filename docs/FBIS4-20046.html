			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["wl" report: "If Everything Goes Well, Figures in 1995 </F> Will Be Positive"]    [Text] Munich -- The measures introduced at Deutsche  Aerospace AG (Dasa), Munich, structural and capacity adjustment,  which are primarily linked with the reduction of about 18,000  jobs, are showing a first effect. Juergen E. Schrempp, chairman  of the board of directors, and Financial Director Manfred  Bischoff, had to announce a corporate loss of 694 million German  marks [DM] (last year DM341) upon presentation of the 1993  balance sheet and a decline in turnover by 10 percent to DM18.6  (20.65) billion. They noted that 1994 will again be a  "difficult year." However, this year a smaller loss is expected  while turnover should remain relatively stable and it is hoped  that in 1995, "when the political-economic surroundings do not  deteriorate dramatically," profit will again be made.    Looking at these figures, it is to be taken into account  that  last year the negative balance of Fokker NV, which showed a loss  of about DM460 million -- of which more than half goes to Dasa,  because of its 51-percent share -- was fully compensated. The  changes in the consolidation cycle also have to be considered in  connection with all other figures, e.g. with turnover (at that  time give as DM17.3 billion for 1992). Apart from a surplus of  DM160 (411) million achieved by Deutsche Aerospace Airbus GmbH,  Hamburg, all subsidiaries suffered considerable losses. In  terms of sectors, only space flight achieved a surplus of DM53  million, while aviation suffered a loss of DM327 million and  defense a loss of DM258 million. Dasa AG, which does not have a  contract for transferring profits with, among others, Airbus  GmbH, even suffered a lost of DM994 (503) million, according to  the business report of the mother company Daimler-Benz AG.    Schrempp cited the "slump of our markets in the civilian and  military areas, the massive disadvantages under which Dasa had  to stand on its own in the internationally escalated  competition, and the costs for the structural measure that have  to be taken." These one-time expenditures caused a burden of  DM1.1 billion on the 1993 result.    After taking over Fokker, Dasa has a turnover of $12.9  billion, thus being the third largest aerospace company after  Boeing ($29.6 billion) and McDonnell Douglas ($17 billion).  With a view to the U.S. competition, Schrempp called for "an  international reduction of subsidies" and equal framework  conditions. The prospects in defense technology, the share of  which will probably even out between 20 and 25 percent of  turnover, is "extremely positive," according to him, if the  correct political decisions are made. In the future, focal  issues must be systems that can prevent wars if possible. He  cited, above all, air defense and electronic reconnaissance  systems. Regarding arms exports, he said: "We are not  interested in exporting to countries outside NATO." However,  there must finally be European harmonization so that, in  particular, cooperation projects with France and Great Britain  can be undertaken.    Including the lay-offs, which have already been implemented  this year, in 1994 and 1995 a total of 10,300 jobs are to be  abolished. Schrempp: "These are the most difficult decisions in  a manager's life; on the other hand, this is the only chance to  safeguard jobs." Approximately 1,500 jobs will be abolished in  the Bavarian factories this year. Concerning the factory in  Lemwerder, which is threatened with closure, Schrempp said: "We  are getting out of servicing civilian planes, because it is not  possible in Germany."    As outstanding events of the recent past, Schrempp cited the  first flight of Eurofighter 2000 (whose serial production  Schrempp expects). The Dornier 328 has been introduced on the  market. In the meantime, about 100 orders and options have been  received. Looking at the figures, it is striking that the orders  received have doubled; from the purely arithmetic point of view  they have increased almost to the turnover of two years. This  is primarily due to plane construction with its long periods for  orders. Schrempp pointed out that, as a result of the recession  on the international plane market, the annual Airbus deliveries  have to be reduced from about 200 to 120 to 123 planes and might  even about at 140 to 150.    Regarding the future development, Financial Director  Bischoff  said: "The massive reduction of costs to at least a competitive  level and the increased appearance of Dasa on the markets make  me very confident." Therefore, a positive balance sheet is  expected again as of 1995, if no additional burdens have to be  coped with. He justified the remarkable increase in liquid means  by referring to cost reductions and increased efficiency in  current assets, while reserves for structural and capacity  adjustments increased this item of the balance sheet  considerably. To met the capital need at Fokker, measures have  to be taken this year to improve the balance sheet relations  together with the Dutch Government, which also holds a share in  the company.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Colegio de Mexico international relations </F> specialist Lorenzo]    [Text] The train of Mexico's comprehensive modernization  has already left the station where Carlos Salinas and his  neoliberals were. They did not board it because they were very  busy with the macroeconomic reform. It is obvious today,  however, that they made a mistake because the train was carrying  the political foundations of stability for the new economy. If  the Salinas group (well, what is left of it) starts running  after it, they still just might be able to clamber onto the  caboose. It would not be a very elegant maneuver, but as we  shall see, the alternative is worse.    As things now stand, the Salinas group's main problem is  credibility. How are we to define political credibility? A not  particularly scientific, yet accurate definition would be as  follows: credibility is something that the Mexican Government  currently lacks but that it cannot do without or substitute for  in order to effectively exercise authority in times of crisis.    Credibility is nothing more than a predisposition to believe  someone or something in spite of inadequate objective evidence.  In the specific case of a government's credibility, it  represents the degree to which citizens (or at least a majority  of them) are satisfied with the deeds, explanations, promises,  and character of the authorities.    To say that the Mexican Government suffers from a growing  lack of credibility is neither new nor unfounded. Let us look at  a current example. Mori de Mexico, the polling firm run by  Miguel Basanez, posed the following question to 312 persons whom  it interviewed over the telephone in five major cities between 8  and 10 April: "Do you think that the people who are really to  blame for Colosio's assassination will ever be found?"  Forty-three percent said no; 34 percent said they did not know,  and just 23 percent said yes. So, just slightly more than two of  every 10 respondents showed complete confidence in the  government regarding something as important as solving the  murder of the state party's presidential candidate while he was  being guarded by the Presidential Staff.    As for the official investigation into the assassination of  Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo last year in Guadalajara, the  bishop of Cuernavaca, Luis Reynoso, speaking at the Conference  of Mexican Bishops, declared: "We (bishops) are not satisfied  but we do hope to learn more." I do not think that I am  exaggerating if I say that many of us Mexicans feel worse than  the bishops: dissatisfied with the investigations into the  assassinations of Colosio, Posadas, and many others (Buendia,  Ovando, the Ocosingo five, the "Morelia" ejido three, etc.) and  without much hope of seeing these cases solved.    Trust in the authorities is an indispensable, irreplaceable  element of a good government. True, a government can, in  principle, compel obedience to its authority by sheer force, but  in the long run, force or fear has never been the foundation of  good government. And although the threat of force to compel  obedience underlies every form of government, the modern  exercise of authority ought to be based on persuasion, not  coercion.    Ideally, political authority ought to be synonymous with  "legitimate power," and obedience ought to be the upshot of such  legitimacy. But legitimacy is not possible without credibility.  Therefore, it is urgent to restore the credibility of the  governmental structure in our country. Only a massive infusion  of trust in government action will enable the country to cope  successfully with the complex and dangerous dynamics already  unleashed by the major political event that is hurtling towards  us: the 21 August elections.    According to the previously mentioned Mori poll, the gap  between the presidential candidates of the State party (PRI) and  the PRD [Party of the Democratic Revolution] is barely 10  percent, which is just about how far the PRD candidate is in  front of the PAN [National Action Party] standard-bearer.  Moreover, one-quarter of the respondents declined to voice a  preference. So, the actual outcome of the election is going to  depend on them, in other words, the people who are not sure or  do not wish to say for whom they are going to vote. One can, of  course, argue about how representative and statistically  reliable the Mori survey is (90 percent), but there can no  longer be any doubt that the upcoming election will be genuinely  competitive.    After ludicrous, shameful experiences like the unopposed  candidacy of Jose Lopez-Portillo, the fact that electoral  competition is finally taking root in Mexico is very  encouraging. Institutionalizing such competition is the only  path to a truly democratic political system because only then  will the electorate have real choices in terms of leaders and  programs. Nonetheless, darkening what should be a bright horizon  is the fact that in 1994 this competition is going to take place  amid civic skepticism.    True electoral competition against a backdrop of mounting  mistrust, marked by doubts about the impartiality of the  government during the campaign and, above all, about the  accuracy of the official returns, is a perfect prescription for  turning the post-election period into precisely what it ought  not to be: a conflict that swamps institutional channels, a  conflict of whose origin we are well aware but of whose outcome  we are not sure. And an ungovernable country is one of the  outcomes it may hold for us.    PRI's preparations for 21 August and whatever comes  afterward  are not at all reassuring. According to a PRI document that the  newspaper REFORMA (16 April) obtained a copy of, the party  already has a plan, designed by propaganda experts, to use the  supposedly neutral authorities for its benefit, among other  things. Specifically, the plan "envisages the selection of  groups of officials from political organizations, such as the  IFE [Federal Electoral Institute], the Interior Secretariat...to  issue discreet, programmed, and timely statements with the  message and of the intensity deemed necessary to define and  control the direction of the debate." Since the problem is  credibility, not an official victory, PRI already intends to  proclaim victory on 21 August and to back it up with, among  other things, the "testimony of polling-place officials, stating  that they had seen no anomalies." Therefore, the State party is  alive and kicking. The separation between PRI and the government  Colosio announced shortly before he was assassinated has not  taken place; much less is there a determination to hold clean  elections.    PRI is not showing any real willingness to change its  long-standing policy, the one that says: elections in Mexico are  useful for a lot of things, except to decide who is to govern.  And the fact that the famous "Atlacomulco group," headed by  Carlos Hank Gonzalez, is the one that has has been charged with  seeing to it that PRI's new candidate, Ernesto Zedillo, wins  makes it even more unlikely that the outcome of the election  next August will be credible. The "Atlacomulco group," which is  monopolizing leadership posts in the Zedillo campaign, does not  exactly have a reputation as a friend of modern democracy. Quite  the opposite: it is known for its iron-like determination to  prolong the authoritarianism that has turned out to be such a  good deal for many of its members.    While Mexican politics was conducted against the backdrop of  the authoritarian normalcy that was created and bolstered during  65 years of uninterrupted control by a State party, electoral  credibility was not a particularly important factor because  average Mexicans had no choice but to abide by the dictates of  the government, whether or not they believed or liked it. Until  1988, we Mexicans had no real political options. The situation  is different today. Going against the grain and overcoming  countless obstacles, the options have finally emerged, and  therefore, the elections are going to be competitive. This time,  however, the opposition (the Cardenas people in particular) is  better organized than in 1988, and it will be harder for the  president and PRI to assure the country's governability if the  opposition refuses to accept the legality of the election  results.    When trust in the authorities is something more than just  resignation, credulity, or naivete, it is the result of  experience, something born of a pattern of conduct by government  officials towards the governed, whereby they keep their promises  and make their actions consistent with their words. The Salinas  group has been credible only in the realm of macroeconomics.  Hence, Salinas' credibility is strong only among the financial  elite.    As far as the overseas audience is concerned, Salinas' major  promise was to carry out neoliberal economic change while  maintaining social order and political stability. Since the  latter part of the promise has not been kept (Chiapas, Tijuana),  Salinas' credibility abroad has declined dramatically. One good  example of this is the recent article by Michael Elliot in the 4  April issue of NEWSWEEK. According to him, today, Mexico is  paying the price for having brought about economic change while  trying to save itself the political cost. Salinas' "fatal  error," which, according to Elliot, Asian and African leaders  should take note of, is this: "If a society is granted economic  freedom, it will also have to be given other freedoms: to elect  its authorities and to express its desires openly. If this does  not happen, the supposed economic liberator will be consumed by  the fire of unfulfilled expectations."    At the beginning of this article, I stated that perhaps all  is not lost as far as credibility is concerned. Indeed, the  president can still lessen the long-term consequences of his  "fatal error." For example, he could and should make a dramatic  gesture to separate his government and his economic reforms from  the fate of Ernesto Zedillo in particular and PRI in general. He  could summon the leaders of the authentic opposition (PRD and  PAN) to a "summit meeting" and at last lay the groundwork for a  true historic pact. Such a gesture could transform what  threatens to be a disastrous finale for his six-year term into  something positive and different: a transition from  authoritarianism to democracy.    What is at stake today is the governability of the country  after August. Without such governability, the gains that have  been made in the neoliberal economic agenda run the risk of  being undone. If that were to happen, there would be neither  political nor economic modernity, and the losers would not be  just, as always, the people on the bottom but also the ones on  top.</p>

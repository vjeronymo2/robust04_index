			<p><P> October 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GROVE SCHOOL EQUIPS MUSIC AFICIONADOS TO PLAY FOR A LIVING  </P> <P> Joe Kidwell kept warm through three Alaskan winters by humming "Summertime"  while on ski patrol for the U. S. Army. But he recently got the chills singing  it at a Van Nuys music school where such pop icons as Linda Ronstadt and Barry  Manilow have taken classes.  </P> <P> "Summertime, and the living is easy," croaked Kidwell, 21, wide-eyed and  trembling slightly with stage fright during his first performance for fellow  students in a class at Grove School of Music. But with the steady encouragement  of his teacher and classmates, Kidwell's reedy voice became smooth enough for  him to belt out the last few lines of the George Gershwin tune.  </P> <P> During the past two years, Grove's reputation for preparing students, such as  the clean-cut Kidwell, as well as aspiring long-haired singers for musical  success has enabled it to double its enrollment and to move out of its cramped  quarters in Studio City.  </P> <P> </P> <P> $1.5-Million Renovation  </P> <P> The San Fernando Valley's only music trade school, which offers a variety of  classes, including rock keyboard and Latin percussion, occupies the old Daily  News building in the 14500 block of Sylvan Street. The school has spent $1.5  million to renovate the building, including the addition of two recording  studios.  </P> <P> "It's an outstanding school -- one of the best in the country," said Jack  Wheaton, administrative director of jazz studies at USC's School of Music.  </P> <P> "They're particularly strong in turning out people who are specifically trained  to go out and make a living in music, be it nightclubs or writing for TV and  film."  </P> <P> "They have some fantastic teachers," said David Roitstein, a professor at  CalArts. "I have a lot of respect for what they're doing."  </P> <P> But the school that trains its 600 students to become, or at least rub  shoulders with, some of the world's best jazz, rock and popular musicians  cannot boast of a glamorous campus. The seedy pawnshops and discount stores of  Van Nuys Boulevard are just a block away from the school's one-story building.  </P> <P> "This school shouldn't be here," said Swiss drummer Pascal Chollet, 25, one of  the 100 or so foreign students enrolled at Grove. "We should be in Hollywood  where the clubs are."  </P> <P> But Joel DiBartolo, a bass player on "The Tonight Show" and an instructor at  Grove, pointed out that many of the city's movie and recording studios are in  the San Fernando Valley. For example, Universal Studios is in Universal City  and Evergreen Recording Studios is in North Hollywood.  </P> <P> "Musicians these days can't just depend on the club scene for work," DiBartolo  said.  </P> <P> Despite its unglamorous location, Grove manages to attract students from the  East Coast, Hawaii and Japan. Ronstadt took a guitar class there in the  school's early days, and Manilow studied electronic music there even after he  became famous, according to Todd Ferguson, the school's administrator.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Long Hours  </P> <P> Accredited by the National Assn. of Schools of Music, Grove offers several  one-year programs, including general musicianship, recording and engineering,  composing and arranging, and guitar. Costs vary from $200 for a 20-hour  workshop to thousands of dollars for the yearlong programs.  </P> <P> From early in the morning until long after midnight, students crowd the  school's gray, carpeted halls, carrying instrument cases and music folders. It  is not uncommon for cafeteria patrons to have students interrupt their lunch  with spontaneous renditions of country and Western songs or guitar "riffs."  </P> <P> Some of the students resemble the members of the long-haired rock band Bon  Jovi, whose members wear tight black clothes and earrings; others would not  look out of place in a business office.  </P> <P> Chip McClelland, 49, still dresses like an accountant on holiday in beige  slacks and a button-down shirt. He left his accounting firm and family behind  four months ago in Maui, Hawaii, to pursue his passion -- playing the keyboard.  </P> <P> "Half the people on the island think I'm crazy to come over here with a bunch  of heavy metal guitar players, but my wife understands," McClelland said. "I  knew I had holes in my training, but I was almost buried by the work last  quarter."  </P> <P> Joe Caruso, 26, who traveled from Queens, N. Y., to Van Nuys to perfect his  guitar playing, also finds the curriculum challenging. Caruso wears his long,  black hair in a frizzy halo and said he performs on weekends in a band called  Chastity.  </P> <P> "I can get on stage and play rock all day, but I want to be a better musician  than that," Caruso said. He said he doesn't have the discipline to learn to  read music on his own.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Versatility Essential  </P> <P> The professional music world has become so competitive that, in order to have  an edge, even rockers have to be able to play a variety of styles, said Rob  McConnell, a well-known trombone player and bandleader who teaches at Grove.  </P> <P> "Ideally, a guitarist should know the whole electronic side of things,  synthesized music, doing solos, acoustic, 12-string and maybe even how to play  another instrument," McConnell said. "Otherwise, with the turnover in the  popularity of rock groups, you could be a hot rock player today and some bum on  the street tomorrow."  </P> <P> Since the school was established in 1974, its philosophy has been to make its  students marketable, said founder and President Dick Grove, 61. A well-known  composer, arranger and pianist, Grove teaches at the school.  </P> <P> John Campbell, 28, of Claremont said his education at Grove has paid off. A  free-lance keyboard player, composer and arranger, Campbell was able to build a  home recording studio this year with his $85,000 in earnings. Attending the  school "changed my life," Campbell said. "I'd never be this successful  otherwise."  </P> <P> Jerry Gates, 33, of Canoga Park said he has only made $17,000 as a free-lancer  during the nine months since he graduated. But he credits the school with  teaching him how to write music, including jingles for Bank of America.  </P> <P> Being a musician "is not like being a lawyer or accountant," he said. "It takes  years to build contacts, but I love music and that's what drives me," despite  constant rejections and low income.  </P></p>

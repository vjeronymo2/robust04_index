			<p><P> February 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> DURAN DURAN, PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS A-GO-GO  </P> <P> Admirers of the female form in a state of go-go had a field day Thursday at the  sold-out Universal Amphitheatre, where headliner Duran Duran and opening act  the Pursuit of Happiness both offered gyratin' gals aplenty as sidelights to  their respective shticks.  </P> <P> The mutual attraction to miniskirts aside, the two groups couldn't conceivably  have been more different -- not even in what their respective use of dancing  girls signifies about their art.  </P> <P> Duran lead idol Simon le Bon, is, frankly, a lousy dancer himself -- which  doesn't make him any less sensitive a human being, but, hey, his combo is in  the process of re-establishing itself as the premier white teen dance band  (after a short-lived quasi-adventurous phase), and Le Bon does still insist on  moving himself around on stage. Thus: all distractions welcome, be they ladies  or light shows.  </P> <P> Initially, the sexy, graceful choreography of the two backup singers added  needed visual spice, but we should know better than to expect the folks that  brought us the "Girls on Film" video to leave well enough alone, and soon the  femmes were simulating salacious stuff with band members, before stripping down  behind a screen and shaking their stuff in silhouette to the purportedly  anti-porn "Skin Trade." Would someone please explain, as the song says, the  reason for this strange behavior?  </P> <P> Duran Duran's occasionally savvy dance fever mightn't have seemed quite so  empty had it not followed the much tougher, more tuneful and literate hard-pop  blitzkrieg of the Pursuit of Happiness, a Canadian quintet with all the makings  of a great rock 'n' roll band. Where Duran is still caught up in selling sex,  marrying the prurient and the pretentious, the Pursuit's Moe Berg actually  writes about it, addresses it, tries valiantly to make some sense of it or at  least get a laugh out of love's odd politics.  </P> <P> And in this case, the winsome women framing the stage were actual members of  the band. Backup singer Leslie Stanwyck's frisky-a-go-go dancing reflected a  casual joy in the music, something that couldn't be said for the often  ponderous impersonality of the headliner's Teflon dance music and its  accompanying goils-on-film.

Two other Serb aircraft  which were not attacked in the same incident probably took off  from the Serb-controlled town of Banja Luka in northern Bosnia,  officials added.    The report confirmed a statement earlier in the day by  Croatian President Franjo Tudjman. The four Bosnian Serb  Super-Galeb planes bombed a military plant at Bugojno and a  residential area northwest of the factory before they were shot  down by two US F-16 fighters, according to a NATO report cited  by the officials. The bombings occurred after the F-16 ordered  the Serbs to land.    The two other Super-Galeb probably bombed an ammunition  plant  and a fuel depot at Novi Travnik in central Bosnia, the report  added. One of the two aircraft probably landed at Ubdina in  Krajina, and the other at Banja Luka.    They had been spotted by the North Atlantic Treaty  Organization's AWACS radar planes near Banja Luka and were later  visually recognized by the F-16 pilots.    NATO officials had earlier identified the aircraft as  Super-Galeb bombers belonging to the Bosnian Serbs but the NATO  report made no mention of the plane's origin. No parachutes  were spotted after the four planes were shot down, so the fate  of the Super-Galeb pilots was unknown, the report said.    Tudjman, in a meeting in Zagreb with special United Nations  representative Yasushi Akashi, complained that UN forces  monitoring Krajina were exercising "inadequate control." "The  example of the Serb military planes that were shot down, and  which had taken off from an area of Croatia under UN protection,  proves it," Tudjman argued, according to the news agency HINA.</p>

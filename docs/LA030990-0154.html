			<p><P> March 9, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BUSH TRANSPORTATION PLAN STARTS HEATED DEBATE;  </P> <P> TAXES: THE EMPHASIS ON STATE AND LOCAL MONEY FOR ROADS AND TRANSIT MEETS  IMMEDIATE CRITICISM. ITS BACKERS POINT TO ITS 'GREATER FLEXIBILITY.'  </P> <P> With its emphasis on state and local funding, the Bush Administration has begun  what is certain to be a contentious debate over the appropriate federal role in  maintaining the nation's transportation structures, congressional leaders and  transportation industry officials said Thursday.  </P> <P> "That debate will involve a reexamination of whose responsibility is  transportation -- the state and local governments or the federal government,"  said Gary Brosch, director of the Center for Urban Transportation Research at  the University of South Florida in Tampa. "The Administration, by this  document, is saying that it's a local problem, and that states and local  governments should find ways to solve it."  </P> <P> The new transportation policy announced officially Thursday -- which contains  169 guidelines and 65 legislative objectives, but offers no specific programs  or funding proposals -- sends a signal of the Administration's intention to  stick by its decision not to raise taxes. Although the policy describes the  need for transportation upgrades, it rejects calls for federal taxes to pay for  improvements.  </P> <P> Instead, the policy argues that maintenance of some highways, bridges and  airports should become more of a municipal and state responsibility. Moreover,  the policy encourages local governments to raise taxes or to seek  private-sector financing deals for repairs.  </P> <P> The policy drew immediate criticism, foreshadowing the expected debates to come  between the Republican Administration and the Democratic Congress.  </P> <P> One of the most vocal critics was Rep. Peter A. DeFazio (D-Ore.), who told  Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner at a House Public Works and  Transportation Committee subcommittee hearing: "I think it's really vintage  George Bush White House material -- a Twinkie transportation policy -- airy,  light, but nothing but fluff at the core . . . .  </P> <P> "At a time when our highways are crumbling, our bridges are collapsing, our  airways are becoming overcrowded, dangerously, the Administration's solution is  disengagement, wash your hands of the mess, call it a local problem."  </P> <P> Other Democrats complained that the Administration has not been moving fast  enough to spend uncommitted balances of billions of dollars in aviation,  highway and mass transit trust funds. The trust funds are financed with the  9-cent federal gasoline tax and other user fees. Both the Reagan and Bush  Administrations have used trust fund balances to help offset on paper the size  of the federal budget deficit. Trust fund money cannot be spent for purposes  other than transportation.  </P> <P> "This money has been paid by the American highway users in the expectation that  it will be used for transportation purposes," said Rep. Glenn M. Anderson  (D-San Pedro), chairman of the public works committee. "We are deceiving them  by not spending the money for highways and transit despite the staggering needs  which exist."  </P> <P> In releasing the report, Skinner said: "The policy provides greater flexibility  for state and local governments to raise revenues . . . for example, collecting  tolls on highways, and encouraging greater private investment in  transportation."  </P> <P> He said the policy was released in time to be used by the Administration in  debates over the reauthorization of aviation, highway and mass transit  programs. Those programs will expire over the next 24 months.  </P> <P> "It is not the panacea or the answer to all of the problems in transportation,"  Skinner said. "It was never designed to be that. It was designed to be a  strategic framework under which we can make the many decisions that we are  required to make and that we could use to reauthorize aviation and surface  transportation."  </P> <P> In part, the 129-page policy statement calls for legislation aimed at:  </P> <P> Aviation -- Recovering a higher portion of program costs from user fees, and  creating capacity at heavily traveled airports by imposing charges per  passenger.  </P> <P> Highway -- Increasing the state and local share of federal-aid projects,  allowing greater use of tolls on federal-aid highways, focusing federal aid on  highway programs and projects of "national significance."  </P> <P> Urban Mass Transit -- Eliminating barriers to private sector participation in  financing and operating projects, increasing state and local share of financing  of federally assisted projects and reducing federal operating assistance for  urban transit.  </P> <P> Railroads -- Installing user fees to recover some of federal railroad safety  inspection costs, repealing the Federal Employers' Liability Act to limit  federal government exposure to costly worker suits and eliminating federal  subsidies for Amtrak while requiring states to pay a greater share of the costs  of routes through their areas.  </P> <P> Skinner received some support from Republicans on the subcommittee.  </P> <P> Rep. Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad), who represents southern Orange County, told  Skinner: "I was particularly heartened to see your interest in blending  government's efforts with that of the private sector. In California . . . there  is no question we're moving in the direction of the private sector assisting us  (because) . . . we cannot furnish all the funds . . . publicly."  </P> <P> Packard added, however, that he is disappointed by the "use of the trust funds  to camouflage the deficit, when they are so badly needed for transportation  purposes. I don't think any member of this committee is going to change their  feeling on that."  </P> <P> But Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) said in a statement that the federal  government should not abandon its prime role in transportation financing or  shift the major burden onto the states.  </P> <P> "The President says no new taxes, but what he apparently means is no new  federal taxes, because he's proposing that the states raise their taxes very  substantially," he said. "It's not clear the states can do so."  </P> <P> At the hearing, Skinner cited California's reluctance to raise its gasoline  tax: "I think we've got to do a better job of explaining to people all over the  country, but especially to the people of California, (if) they want clean air,  they want efficient transportation, they want to eliminate congestion, and they  want backups in the case of earthquakes, they are going to have to pay more for  fuel than the lowest prices . . . being paid almost anywhere in the country."  </P> <P> As for the surplus trust fund balances, Skinner told the subcommittee the new  transportation policy calls for spending more of the uncommitted money, but  does so only in "generic" terms.  </P></p>

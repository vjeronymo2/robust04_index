			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / Management: Streets ahead - Europe's manufacturing quality and productivity still lag far behind Japan's Professor Dan Jones and his colleagues at Cardiff Business School, Cambridge University and Andersen Consulting were at it again yesterday. Two years after telling an audience of UK motor component makers that their productivity and quality was grossly inferior to that of Japanese counterparts, they announced that many continental European groups are no better - and some are worse. Jones, also co-author of The Machine That Changed the World, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology study which highlighted the significance of 'lean' manufacturing, was unveiling the results of a new Worldwide Manufacturing Competitiveness Study*. The results expand on the 1992 benchmarking project which showed Japanese component makers outperforming the UK's by a 2:1 margin in productivity and by no less than 100:1 in quality. The latest project investigates the manufacturing performance and management practices of 71 motor components plants in nine countries: 14 in the US and Canada, 12 in the UK, 11 in France, nine in both Japan and Germany, eight in Italy and four in both Spain and Mexico. Among these, the study identifies 'world-class' plants which meet certain criteria: substantially higher volumes of finished parts compared with similar-sized non-world-class concerns; high-capacity utilisation; more automated assembly processes, backed up with effective 'fool-proofing'; larger and more rapidly changing product portfolios; and integrated and tightly controlled processes. The study once again makes uneasy, and for many UK and Italian components makers chilling, reading. It indicates that despite progress in Europe, Japanese suppliers are improving at no less rapid a rate - and even widening the competitiveness gap with the UK and Italy. While the study identified no companies by name, it is unlikely to pass unchallenged by many components suppliers. Nissan, Toyota and Honda publicly maintain that suppliers to their UK 'transplants' are doing well, but privately express reservations about their progress. To make the findings relevant beyond the motor industry, the study covered production of seats, exhausts and brakes - chosen because they require a variety of process technologies. The researchers consistently found a 2:1 difference in productivity performance between world-class plants and the remainder. The quality gap was found to be even higher - 9:1 in seats, 16:1 in brakes and 170:1 in exhausts. Performance was measured by two main criteria: productivity, in terms of annual units of output divided by labour hours, and quality by the number of supplied parts per million claimed by vehicle manufacturers to have been defective. Financial measures were not used. In one world-class seat plant there were 237 customer complaints per million seats delivered, compared with 2,071 for a non-world-class facility; the world-class exhaust plant received eight complaints per million exhausts and the world-class brake plant nine per million on brakes. The US was found to be closest to Japan in quality, with Japanese plants retaining 'only' a 30 per cent advantage. This stretched out to a 4:1 advantage over France and Germany, rising to at least 8:1 in the case of the UK and Italy. Japan's overall productivity and quality performance, meanwhile, 'is significantly better than it was two years ago, with improvements in the range of 38 per cent. UK companies also show a big improvement (31 per cent). This, however, has not been enough to qualify as world class and shows that the gap with Japan is widening'. Of the 71 surveyed companies, many were subsidiaries of big producers already supplying globally. While these have had a unique opportunity to combine knowledge and learning from different countries, they have also had to find compromises between their own corporate cultures and conditions and practices outside their domestic base. The report says that failure to reconcile the two accounts for Japanese plants generally not doing as well outside Japan as within. Only one of the world-class Japanese plants was outside Japan. One surprising feature of the study is that world-class companies are to be found in Japan, the US, France and Spain - but not in Germany, the presumed motor industry powerhouse of Europe. This 'suggests that one should be wary of confusing the quality and prestige of the finished product with the efficiency and sophistication of the process which produced it'. Product simplification and co-ordination of the supply chain must receive priority from German industry if it is to become more competitive, the study concludes. It also found US plants to be good on process control and delivered quality, at least among first-tier suppliers. 'The challenge now lies in extending this to the second tier' - the thousands of much smaller parts makers who supply the big components companies. What should non-world-class companies do about improving their positions? The researchers found that the common denominators in the world-class plants were process control and very tight management of the entire supply chain. Many aspects of plant performance which have received considerable publicity, such as the use of teams and suggestion schemes, did not appear to be universal requirements for good performance. Indeed, the study warns that simply aping the quality circles and problem-solving groups which form part of world-class Japanese companies cannot work. 'The real benefits of problem-solving structures appear to lie in the long-term continuous improvement of a basically sound system . . . imitating practices from other countries of indiscriminately devolving responsibility to the shop floor and hoping that problems will disappear is clearly not going to work.' *Available free: tel 0181 780 1322.  --------------------------------------------- How Japan still leads the world  --------------------------------------------- 'World class'     Country of    Country of plants             location      ownership  --------------------------------------------- Japan                 5             6 US                    3             3 France                3             3 Spain                 2             0 Germany               0             1  --------------------------------------------- Source: Andersen Consulting  ---------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Backfit Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This regulation does not impose any new requirements on production or utilization facilities. The regulation deletes the requirement that all states within the plume exposure pathway EPZ for a given site fully participate in an offsite exercise for that specific site at least every 7 years. It also relaxes the requirement to perform an ingestion exposure pathway exercise from every 5 years to every 6 years. These changes would permit, but do not require, licensees to change their emergency plans and procedures. Therefore, these changes are not considered backfits as defined in 10 CFR 50.109 (a)(1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 10 CFR Part 50 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Antitrust, Classified information, Criminal penalties, Fire protection, Incorporation by reference, Intergovernmental relations, Nuclear power plants and reactors, Radiation protection, Reactor siting criteria, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons set out in the preamble, and under the authority of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended, and 5 U.S.C. 552 and 553, the NRC is adopting the following amendments to 10 CFR part 50.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=56 g=1 f=1 --> PART 50_DOMESTIC LICENSING OF PRODUCTION AND UTILIZATION FACILITIES  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

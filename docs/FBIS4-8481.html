			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The TV May Begin Enterprising; Has </F> the Issue of the Third Channel Been Decided?"]    [Text] NEPSZABADSAG has been informed that as part of a  so-called "3000 series decree" (not published in MAGYAR KOZLONY)  the government has concurred with the idea that the Hungarian  Television establish a business organization for the operation  of the planned third television channel.    We have already reported earlier of a plan to make available  to Hungarian Television the vacated Channel 58, (which in  earlier days carried the programs of Moscow Television).  According to information leaked, this frequency would be used by  the MTV [Hungarian Television] to broadcast educational programs  in the morning hours, and commercial television programs in the  afternoons. A corporation--with MTV holding a large proportion  of shares--would be established to operate the commercial  television, and the cabinet has granted the needed permit at its  3 March session. Some professional and financial investors would  also become involved in the corporation, and these would  include, for example, Gabor Koltay and Levente Szorenyi.    The financial concerns of the television and the radio will  once again be discussed at tomorrow's cabinet meeting. Three  weeks ago, at their 3 March meeting, the ministers have already  dealt with this subject, but the proposal was rejected at the  time. This subject was supposed to be discussed again at their  meeting last week, but this did not take place, supposedly  because of the trip abroad by its proponent, Gyorgy Schamschula.  Media executives cannot count on much money, of course, even  though the MTV has asserted a claim for about 7 billion forints  in subsidies (based on expenditures to be incurred as a result  of the mandatory transition to the SECAM broadcasting system).  NEPSZABADSAG was informed that the MTV may hope for a grant of 1  billion forints at most, and those funds should also be used to  settle the MTV's 500-million-forint indebtedness to the state.</p>

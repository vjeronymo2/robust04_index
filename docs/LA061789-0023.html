			<p><P> June 17, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOW ABOUT A PARADE TO SHOW APPRECIATION FOR FINE LAKER EFFORT?  </P> <P> I'm sure the Lakers are not, and they shouldn't be, ashamed of their play  during these last four games. I watched every moment of every game and felt  proud of the Lakers.  </P> <P> Are there parades only for winners? There should be an appreciation parade for  the Lakers.  </P> <P> PAUL A.

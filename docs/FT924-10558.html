			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / ICI's profits fall 53% to Pounds 93m IMPERIAL Chemical Industries yesterday confirmed the dire state of the world economy as Britain's biggest manufacturer reported pre-tax profits down 52.5 per cent from Pounds 196m to Pounds 93m during the third quarter. The group, traditionally seen as Britain's manufacturing bellwether stock, now generates more than 80 per of its turnover outside the UK. ICI's shares fell 14p to Pounds 10.36. Earnings per share fell 70 per cent from 17.9p to 5.3p, due largely to a tax charge. ICI's turnover fell 10 per cent from Pounds 3.07bn to Pounds 2.77bn. Adverse exchange rates accounted for 6 per cent of the decline, and lower volumes, mainly in the UK and US, for 2 per cent. The remaining 2 per cent consisted of price deflation. Sir Denys Henderson, chairman, said the company had been hit by worldwide persistent recession. He blamed the disappointing results on particularly poor demand. He warned there was little expectation of improvement in trading conditions in the near term. The recent devaluation of sterling would help overseas markets. Sir Denys said his priorities remained to contain costs and maintain a strong balance sheet. Mr Colin Short, finance director, said the separation of ICI into two businesses should be completed by the year's end. The group plans to demerge its pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and the bulk of its specialities operations into ICI Bioscience, leaving the rest, including industrial chemicals, paints, materials and explosives, in a new ICI. A decision whether to go ahead would be taken at the board's February meeting, Mr Short said. He warned that more deals were likely to be announced before February and that the group was still in a period of considerable change. Sir Denys said the markets for materials and industrial chemicals remained weak. Prices were under considerable pressure, particularly in Europe. The earnings per share were hit by a tax charge of 48 per cent during the third quarter. This was because of earnings generated by overseas and associated companies. Mr Short said this was a one-off and the rate would fall to 34 per cent for the whole year. Lex, Page 22 Details, Page 25</p>

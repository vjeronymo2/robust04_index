"We never imagined it would come to Shushkevich's  resignation. Literally hours before the vote the Russian  ambassador in Minsk was reporting on the situation in the  republic -- and he expressed no alarm. What happened was like a  bolt from the blue," a Russian Foreign Ministry CIS department  aide admitted.    The removal of Shushkevich is not going to do  Russian-Belarusian relations any good. Boris Yeltsin has lost a  reliable ally, who unconditionally took his side last fall in  the struggle against Khasbulatov and Rutskoy. The Belarusian  leader was one of the few CIS leaders whose loyalty Yeltsin  could always count on: In the past two years it is difficult to  remember an occasion when Minsk has not supported a Moscow  initiative in the context of the Commonwealth.    Shushkevich's stock was pretty high in the international  area  -- he was seen as a reformer and stalwart supporter of the  market economy. Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich, whose  position most observers expect to be strengthened, adopts a  different line. His views are much closer to those of his  Russian colleague Chernomyrdin than to those of Yeltsin and  Shushkevich.    The results of the vote removed the final doubts about the  Belarusian parliament's orientation: The communists have a  solid majority in it. The signs are that someone who will more  easily find a common language with Zyuganov than with Yeltsin  will be elected the new chairman of the Supreme Soviet.    In this situation there is practically no hope of the  Belarusian leaders' carrying out serious reforms. The  republic's economic prospects could not be gloomier.  Nevertheless, Chernomyrdin will fly to Minsk in February to  agree on a mechanism for the unification of the two states'  monetary systems. Given that this step was causing thunderous  protests on the part of Russian reformers even before  Shushkevich's removal, one can imagine the kind of reaction  there will be now that the Belarusian parliament has shown its  hand.    As for Belarusian foreign policy, according to Russian  diplomats, it will not change significantly. Minsk is too  heavily dependent on Moscow and the leaders of the communist  majority in the Supreme Soviet are unlikely to openly display  their ideological enmity toward Yeltsin.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ranjit Kumar] </F>   [Text] The induction of one more indigenously built  submarine into the Indian Navy may give a feeling of temporary  relief to the Navy, but it has to get ready for the days when  its submarine capability will continue to decline in the coming  years. With the induction of this German designed Type-1500  submarine built at the Indian Naval Dockyard, the number of  submarines in the Indian Navy has gone up to 19, but India's  submarine capability will continue to decline from next year.  To compensate for the expected shortfall and to maintain strike  capability, the Indian Navy has prepared a 15-year plan, but  there is no possibility of implementing the plan due to a lack  of financial resources.    At the end of the seventies, the Indian Navy had acquired  eight Foxtrot class submarines from the Soviet Union. These  submarines are more than 25 years old now, meaning end of their  life span. One of these submarines was retired last year. Now  these Foxtrot class submarines are in line for retirement one  after another. Thus, all Foxtrots will be retired in the next  five to six years. If no new submarines are added, the number  of submarines India operates will be reduced to 12.    Other than the Foxtrot class of submarines, the Indian Navy  has eight 'Kilo' class submarines from Russia. These submarines  were acquired by the end of the eighties. During the same time,  two German H.D.W. Type-1500 submarines were directly purchased.  An agreement with Germany was reached where it will assist in  the design and building of four such submarines for the Indian  Navy. India has already built two of these submarines, but the  Indian Government has not taken any decision to build the other  two because of lack of finances. It costs four billion rupees  to build a submarine and in the current year only 27.38 billion  have been allocated to the Navy out of the defense budget --  about 13 percent of the total defense budget. It is paradoxical  for the Navy that it not only has to fix funds for the new  submarines to replace the retiring Foxtrots from this limited  budget, but it also has to goad the government into giving a  green signal for the construction of a new aircraft carrier to  replace the retiring air craft carrier Vikrant. The  construction of an aircraft carrier could cost 10 billion  rupees. The Navy also has to find financial resources for the  timely completion of some other now under-construction modern  warships. These are all top-priority plans for the Navy and it  cannot shirk the responsibility of implementing them by  describing one plan as less important than another. Now the  onus rests with the government to take new initiatives to  maintain the submarine capability.    Indians have acquired the unique experience of submarine  construction under German license at the Mazagaon Naval  Dockyard, which has given the confidence to the Indian  scientists that they can build indigenously designed submarines.  Meanwhile, the Indian Government retains the right to build two  more submarines under the German license. Although Prime  Minister Narasimha Rao, while handing over the submarine INS  Shankul to the Navy at the Mazagaon Naval Dockyard in Bombay,  said that more budget will be allocated for the Navy in view of  the immense sea challenges posed to it, he gave no hint as to  when the construction of the next submarine will commence. It  looks like the capability acquired by the Indian Naval Dockyard  will remain unutilized. The director general of the Mazagaon  Dockyard also urged the prime minister to direct the dockyard to  build more submarines to use the acquired facilities.    The first submarine under the German design was built two  years ago. This makes it clear that it takes up to two years to  build a submarine. So, even if India gives an order now to  build another submarine, it will be two years before a new  submarine is inducted. Obviously, India now will have to pay  special attention to maintaining its submarine capability during  the transitional period. In fact, in view of the possibility of  retiring Foxtrots one after another, the Defense Ministry should  have ordered the construction of new submarines long ago to  maintain continuity in the submarine building process. With  this option unavailable now, it is feared that the Indian Navy's  submarine capability will continue to decline in the coming  years.    According to naval experts, the Foxtrot series of submarines  will prove ineffective in the modern naval warfare scenario.  Moreover, these submarines remain in dock for maintenance and  repair work more than half the time. Naval sources say that  these submarines have become so old their maintenance is proving  too costly for the Navy. That is why they cannot be considered  effective for strategic reasons.    While the Indian Navy's submarine capability will continue  to  decline in the coming years, the Pakistan Navy is restless to  acquire three most sophisticated submarines. For the time  being, Pakistan has eight submarines and this number will go up  to 11 or 12 with the induction of new submarines. Pakistan soon  is going to purchase three 'Agosta' series of sophisticated  submarines from France. Pakistan also is going to receive P-3-C  Orion aircraft, which are used for antisubmarine search and  destroy operations. With the help of three such aircraft,  Pakistan can render the Indian Naval fleet ineffective.    Other than Pakistan, the Chinese Navy is also a cause of  serious concern for India because its submarines have been seen  strolling in the Andaman Sea in the name of cooperation with the  Burmese Navy. China at present has more than 100 submarines, out  of which 20 are nuclear powered. China's 'Xia' class of  submarines can even fire long-range ballistic missiles. In view  of the submarine capabilities of China and Pakistan, the strong  possibility of declining Indian capability is a cause of  strategic concern.</p>

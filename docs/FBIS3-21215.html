The Mission visited 14 materials research organizations,  including the Angarsk Electrolysis-Chemical Complex, a research  institute in Siberia. This mission recently compiled its survey  report based on the observation of ``materials research  activities in various shapes and forms, many of which may be  considered competitive with counterparts in Japan and the U.S.''    According to that report, Russia's Atomic Energy Department,  in cooperation with Phillips Corp., is pursuing a TV-tube  production project with a production goal of 3 million pieces  per year. An NPO (Ratti) (in a Moscow suburb) is studying  high-temperature gas furnaces, carbon-coated fuels, and the  nuclear reactor Topaz for space uses; is developing  photomagnetic disks with a technology level equivalent to that  of Sony Corp.; and is carrying out research with a single  crystal growth device via the Czochralski method, one of the  pull-up methods.    At the 40-year-old Chemical Technology Research Institute,  the report says, rare metals that have been made three to four  times more efficient by the coprecipitation method are being  applied to piezo-ceramics, and 300- to 500-kg lots of samarium  are being produced in a large crucible by using large-current  electromagnetic induction.</p>

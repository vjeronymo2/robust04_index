			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / UK Company News: A promise of no jam tomorrow - A look at Trafficmaster, which is en route for a market quote Growing traffic congestion - and offering customers a way of avoiding it - are key elements in the strategy of a group which will soon come to the market with a capitalisation of about Pounds 25m. Trafficmaster is a Luton-based company which claims to offer the world's first commercially available on-board traffic monitoring system. A dashboard-mounted screen advises of upcoming traffic jams and road accidents, in time for drivers to alter their route. Mr David Martell, chief executive, said Monday mornings were the worst time to travel on the UK's motorways, while Friday mornings were best in all parts of the country. He said: 'Cynically, I think this is because salesmen don't work on Fridays - they play golf.' Trafficmaster has installed infra-red sensors which monitor traffic speed, transmit it by radio to a central computer and then feed the information to visual display units in subscribers' vehicles. The complete network is updated every three minutes, and advises motorists of the average speed and direction of any hold-up. The system already covers more than 1,000 miles of motorways and trunk roads in the south of England and the Midlands. Part of the flotation proceeds will be used to extend the network to cover the main motorways in England, Wales and Scotland by the end of this year, and main trunk roads during 1995 and 1996. Trafficmaster units can be rented for Pounds 30 a month, or Pounds 19.50 a month if purchased. The screens currently cost Pounds 199, but, like other electronic products, prices are likely to fall rapidly if and when they start being sold by high street retailers. Mr Martell, 45, is an accountant with interests in property and wine shipping. He said the idea for Trafficmaster came to him when sitting in an M25 traffic jam on the way to Heathrow with an old school friend, Mr Ian Williams, who is now a non-executive director of the company they founded. Mr Martell is a fan of motorways and believes some of the critical press coverage about them is undeserved. However, he was struck by the poor quality of information about traffic conditions available to drivers. The company was established in 1988 and, backed by Hambro venture capital funds, developed the necessary dedicated hardware and software. A pilot scheme, covering 250 miles of motorways around London, was successfully concluded in 1992, after which the company was awarded a 12-year licence to operate the system on all English motorways and trunk roads. The licence is non-exclusive, and Mr Martell acknowledges that other organisations might seek to enter the market. However, he believes the company's investment means it has a four-year technological lead and a window of opportunity to market its product. To date Trafficmaster is still incurring trading losses, but has installed about 2,000 screens. It is close to break-even at that level, but further investment on extending the network will raise that hurdle. However, once the network is complete, revenue from each additional subscriber should make profitability climb quickly. Trafficmaster said that existing subscribers, which include mainly senior employees from 55 of the FT-SE 100 companies, report that the system helps save time, reduces frustration and provides insurance against delay. There seems little danger of diminishing demand. The Confederation of British Industry estimates that traffic congestion now costs the UK Pounds 15bn a year. According to Department of Transport forecasts, the number of vehicles in the UK will grow by 60 per cent by 2020, and road usage will more than double in the same period. Trafficmaster has patents pending in 48 countries. In the US - where Trafficmaster is a registered trade mark - Westinghouse Electric, the US conglomerate, has signed an exclusive agreement to introduce the system, probably starting on Washington DC's beltway. About 20 per cent of current subscribers pay extra to use the system as a personal pager. A new generation of screens will use 'smart-card' technology to provide extra services, such as demonstrating each user's position, and sending local information and routing from motorway sites. So far the company has installed giant Trafficmaster screens at 20 Welcome Break motorway sites, with plans for 25 more at ports and airports this year. Each site can generate more than Pounds 18,000 from advertising and also acts as a strong marketing tool to potential subscribers. The screens have also been installed in the reception area of several corporate customers, so staff can check road conditions. The company's big breakthrough to the mass market could come when motor manufacturers start providing guidance systems in new vehicles. Renault and BMW are among the car manufacturers working along these lines. Trafficmaster will be floated by way of a placing, sponsored by Allied Provincial, to raise about Pounds 5m of new money. Peek, the quoted electronics group, currently has a 23 per cent stake in the company, but is not expected to sell any of its shares.</p>

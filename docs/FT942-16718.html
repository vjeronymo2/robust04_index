			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / UK Company News: Cassell to be valued at Pounds 15m in May float Cassell, the publisher which recently bought the Victor Gollancz fiction imprint, will come to the market next month through a placing which will give the group a market capitalisation of about Pounds 15m. Cassell is best known as a publisher of dictionaries and reference books and it was this imprint which was sold in 1986 by CBS, the US media group, to a management buy-in led by Mr Philip Sturrock, an experienced publisher backed by venture capitalists. Mr Sturrock has lifted Cassell's sales from Pounds 3m in 1986 to Pounds 20m last year, mainly by five acquisitions. These include Ward Lock, best known for its Mrs Beeton cookery books; Arms and Armour Press, a specialist military imprint; and New Orchard, which supplies bargain bookshops. This buying spree has left Cassell heavily geared and the group wants to float to finance further expansion by acquisition. It said the businesses acquired were largely lossmaking and under-exploited. Their integration had involved substantial cost-savings. Mr Sturrock said there were still plenty of potential acquisition targets and the 'next stage' was to build turnover to at least Pounds 100m. The group, which employs 175 people, sells about 35 per cent of its books outside the UK - mainly in the US.</p>

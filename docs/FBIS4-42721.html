			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jean-Pierre Clerc: "Pakistani President Makes </F> Case for Nuclear Policy to Francois Mitterrand"]    [Excerpt] Returning from a 10-day "private" -- albeit very  official -- trip to the United States, Pakistani President  Farooq Leghari had a stopover in Paris, during which time he was  received for an hour or so on Thursday, 12 June, by French  President Francois Mitterrand. Elected last November, Mr.  Leghari, 54, is an old militant from Benazir Bhutto's Pakistani  People's Party [PPP]. He was PPP secretary from 1978 to 1983  during the dark days of persecution by the Zia dictatorship.  This experience enabled this affable man to send President  Mitterrand greetings from the Pakistani prime minister, whose  charm was much appreciated by Mr. Mitterrand during his 1990  trip to Islamabad.    According to Mr. Leghari, the two men talked about the  "nuclear issue." By all appearances, the Pakistani leader  sought to verify Paris' lack of flexibility in its position on  supplying a nuclear power plant that had been promised in the  past, before France shied away after signing the NPT [Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty].    The issue of "nonproliferation" has been in play for a long  time, since Islamabad, which is strongly perceived as the  capital of a country which is capable of making "the bomb," or  which has even been credited with already possessing a dozen of  them, is being subjected to pressure to sign the NPT, especially  by the Americans. Mr. Leghari repeated that Pakistan has long  been prepared to sign if India, the brother and enemy against  whom three wars have been fought in the past, does the same.    "We are prepared to undergo inspections provided that both  sides are subject to them," he repeated. The problem is that  New Delhi, which exploded an atomic device in 1974 and which is  apparently ready to install missiles with nuclear capability  pointed at Pakistan, has rejected all suggestions which could  muzzle its security needs, on the grounds that such needs are  also reflected vis-a-vis China, against which it fought a war in  1962.

			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Sedgwick The sighs of relief after sterling's depreciation must have been deafening in Sedgwick's boardroom. Only a few weeks before Black Wednesday, the directors somewhat sheepishly had to admit that they had virtually no forward cover for 1993 dollar income. As investors have since appreciated by marking the shares up 15 per cent more than the market, there is some difference between a Dollars 2 pound and a Dollars 1.51 pound. Financial coup or big slice of luck? Shareholders will no doubt give the company the benefit of the doubt, but Sedgwick will reflect that it is in the business of insurance broking, not currency speculation. It would be a surprise if such a position arises again.</p>

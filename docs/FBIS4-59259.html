			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, May 12 (MENA)--"AL-AHRAM" warned, in its  editorial today, against playing with fire in Yemen.    South Yemen said Arab elements are fighting alongside north  Yemenis, adding that these elements will appear on Aden  television screens, the paper said.    This version has several serious implications.    According to this version, troops from an Arab country may  be  fighting beside the forces of the north along with Arab elements  living in Yemen.    The report may, in the meantime, be a call for  internationalizing the crisis, the paper added.    In any case there should be a warning against any  interference in the Yemeni war in the way reported by the  southerners, the paper said.</p>

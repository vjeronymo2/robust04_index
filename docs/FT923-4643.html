			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Auntie's familiar face: The BBC's brave new world may look old The BBC's ratings for the latest week set out the pattern of current British viewing tastes: the undisputed king of its programmes is the popular drama EastEnders with a total audience of 16.64m, just marginally behind Coronation Street on ITV. The top programmes also include old comedies such as Dad's Army and Porridge, new comedies such as Birds of a Feather, and Paul Daniels' quiz Every Second Counts. But by far the most remarkable show in the ratings is the cheap Australian import Neighbours. It occupies slots three to seven in BBC 1's Top 30, with audiences ranging from 15.23m to 13.74m. Apart from being much-loved by teenagers it is one of the most cost-effective shows on British television. This week, Sir Michael Checkland, director-general of the corporation, suggested that important changes were on the way for viewers as the BBC strives to redefine its role as a public service broadcaster in an age of growing competition from multi-channel television. 'There are some things we simply don't have to get involved with in future,' he said. 'I don't think we have to have, for example, so many quizzes, money-based quizzes or entertainment quizzes on BBC Television. We don't necessarily need to have some of the lower-cost purchased programmes that we have sometimes put into our schedules.' Neither the director-general nor the BBC will give any example of a programme that is likely to be removed from the schedules as a result of the new BBC emphasis on programmes that are 'distinctive', and the planned move towards 'the high ground' of British broadcasting. But certainly Neighbours, originally bought to pad out day-time schedules for a few thousand pounds an hour, is a quintessential example of 'lower-cost purchased programmes'. The fate of soap operas such as Neighbours goes to the heart of the dilemma now facing the BBC. The dilemma is implicit in a confidential BBC document leaked this week to Broadcast magazine. The intention was to publish it after a green paper on the future of the corporation, expected early next month. The document amounts to a mission statement for the future of the corporation as it renegotiates the Royal Charter which runs out in 1996. Derivative formula comedy or simple and unchallenging game shows are out. There is no room for entertainment programmes which belittle or humiliate members of the public. 'The BBC will need to withdraw from areas in which it is no longer able or needed to make an original contribution,' the document says. Instead there will be more live performances on both radio and television. The aim will be to restore the BBC's place as the primary focus of broadcast drama - 'the National Theatre of the airwaves'. Under the blueprint, viewers would receive a steady stream of classic plays from the great dramatists of British culture - from Shakespeare to Jonson, Shaw to Osborne. There would be a similar diet of literary adaptions in serial form. The document does not view such taking of the 'high ground' as a retreat into a cultural ghetto, however. All genres of programmes would be made, but quiz programmes 'would test the audience's imagination and creativity'. In addition, the BBC would continue to schedule mainstream current affairs and religious programmes in prime time even though ITV is steadily moving towards concentrating on popular entertainment which can be virtually guaranteed to deliver high ratings during the main evening viewing hours. In its own words the corporation has set itself four important areas on which to concentrate: News and information across what it refers to as a 'range of outlets' to support fair and informed national debate; Development and expression of British culture and entertainment; Programming and services creating opportunities for education; Communication and interchange of cultures and ideas between Britain and abroad. At a cursory glance it seems difficult to take exception to such a mission for the future which is about as controversial as apple pie and motherhood. And surely it is wise for the BBC to march gradually uphill, away from what is likely to become an increasingly bitter ratings battle between ITV and the satellite television companies? But there are problems inherent in the approach. The first is economic. Most of the programmes under threat tend to be cheap, while most of the replacements are expensive. Costume drama, for example, can cost up to Pounds 1m an hour. The second problem is how to define and choose 'distinctive' programmes. If the new policy is going to have any meaning, programmes designated 'undistinctive' will presumably have to be weeded out from the schedules, even though they are the most popular with audiences, and cost-effective. The BBC's new approach to programming implies a more restrictive attitude to programme commissioning than in the past. Mr Michael Grade, chief executive of Channel 4, might nevertheless have been overstating things in his Edinburgh Television Festival attack last month on the corporation's 'pseudo-Leninist style of management'. It is a rare organisation that deliberately sets out to make its product range less popular in the marketplace, but that is the danger the BBC now appears to be running. If, even for the most intellectually coherent and respectable strategic reasons, the BBC were to lose a significant slice of its audience to rival terrestrial and satellite channels, there could come a point when the universal BBC licence fee would no longer be sustainable. In the week ending August 23 - after the Olympics and before the new autumn schedules began - the total BBC share of the audience was 42.6 per cent. Any drift towards the 30 per cent mark would surely cause problems. It would be difficult for the organisation to convince the government that it deserves to retain its licence-fee status. Despite the disclosures of the document, it is entirely possible that little will change other than a slight adjustment to the tone and character of some programmes. This would mean that the product of a year's soul-searching by numerous committees would be little more than a public display designed to reinforce the BBC's case for its own survival. Public service broadcasters all over Europe will be watching to see how the corporation resolves its conflicts in what is becoming one of the most competitive broadcasting markets. Keep watching for Neighbours in the BBC schedules. As long as it is still there, viewers can be sure that old-fashioned British compromise and accommodation to what the public actually watches continue to triumph over pseudo-Leninism.</p>

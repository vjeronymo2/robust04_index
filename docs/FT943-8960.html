			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / World News in Brief: Footsie rallies after favourable US data The UK stock market staged a recovery yesterday afternoon as a rally in bond prices followed the announcement of satisfactory US consumer price statistics. Early trading had seen the FT-SE 100 Index down by more than 27 points, but there was little sign of the selling pressure feared in the wake of Thursday's interest rate rises in Europe. At the close, the Footsie was 4.1 up on the day at 3,142.3. The index fell 25.2 over the week, with almost all the loss coming in the wake of rate increases in Sweden and Italy.

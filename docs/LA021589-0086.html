			<p><P> February 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FBI INVESTIGATES ALLEGED BRUTALITY IN RAID BY LAPD  </P> <P> The FBI has launched a formal investigation to determine whether six Los  Angeles police officers criminally violated the civil rights of an East Los  Angeles family during a search of the family's home, a Justice Department  spokeswoman said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Department officials referred the case Feb. 1 to the FBI's Los Angeles field  office, said Deborah Burstion-Wade, the spokeswoman in Washington.  </P> <P> "It's an open matter, which means we are looking at the case," she said.  </P> <P> Federal investigators are trying to determine whether the officers committed  any violations under "color of law . . . better known as police brutality" in  the case of Jessie Larez and his family, Burstion-Wade said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Decision Will Be Made  </P> <P> The FBI's findings will be forwarded to the criminal section of the Justice  Department's Civil Rights Division, where a decision will be made whether to  forward the matter to a grand jury for possible indictments, she said.  </P> <P> Such violations, although rarely proven in court, are punishable by fines of as  much as $5,000 and prison terms of one year or longer.  </P> <P> A Police Department spokesman said Tuesday that the department welcomed the  FBI's probe and expressed confidence that the officers will be exonerated.  </P> <P> "The officers were there with proper reason," Cmdr. William Booth said. "They  had a search warrant, they were investigating a murder and they were attacked  by that family."  </P> <P> The investigation stems from a raid in June, 1986, at the Larez home by members  of the Police Department's anti-gang unit, Community Resources Against Street  Hoodlums.  </P> <P> The raid occurred after CRASH officers said they had been tipped that one of  Larez's sons, Edward, was harboring a murder weapon. No gun was found, but  during the search, which was preceded at 7:01 a.m. with officers breaking  windows of the house as a diversion, Jessie Larez's nose was broken, his  daughter, Diane, was yanked to the floor by her hair and numerous household  items were smashed.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Dismissed Complaint  </P> <P> The family formally complained to the Police Department that excessive force  had been used, but the officers' supervisors concluded that the operation was  conducted within department policy and dismissed the complaint.  </P> <P> In October, 1988, after the Larezes had sued the Police Department, a federal  court jury in Los Angeles awarded the family $90,503 in punitive and actual  damages against the officers. Two months later, the same jury held Police Chief  Daryl F. Gates accountable for the officers' actions and ordered the chief to  personally pay more than $170,000 in punitive damages.  </P> <P> City officials have appealed the case.  </P> <P> The Larezes' attorney, Stephen Yagman, expressed confidence Tuesday that the  Justice Department would seek to prosecute the officers. Said Yagman: "The  Justice Department is going to do for Daryl Gates what I never could for him:  make him a defendant in a criminal case."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, a spokesman for City Atty. James K. Hahn dismissed as premature any  discussion of whether his office would defend the officers in a criminal case  were one brought by the Justice Department.  </P> <P> "Until we receive benefit of either a suit or a detailed analysis of  wrongdoing, backing up a criminal investigation," Ted Goldstein said, "it would  be hypothetical at this point as to whether we could or would defend them."  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 8, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARMS URANIUM OUTPUT ENDING, GORBACHEV SAYS  </P> <P> Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev ended a whirlwind visit to Britain on  Friday with one of his familiar unilateral disarmament gestures and a fresh  warning to Western politicians that it is time for them to respond more  positively to his "new thinking."  </P> <P> The gesture -- a halt in production of nuclear weapons-grade uranium and the  closing by 1991 of two reactors used to make weapons-grade plutonium -- was  quickly dismissed by independent experts and the Bush Administration as  relatively meaningless in military terms.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Could Strain Alliance  </P> <P> But his warning that a North Atlantic Treaty Organization plan to modernize its  short-range nuclear arsenal could force the Soviet Union to follow suit and  jeopardize conventional arms reduction negotiations in central Europe is  considered likely to put further strain on a Western alliance already at odds  over the modernization issue.  </P> <P> Gorbachev's moves came amid a dazzling display of traditional British pomp and  circumstance that culminated with lunch at Windsor Palace, where Queen  Elizabeth II accepted the Soviet leader's invitation to visit Moscow at an  undetermined future date.  </P> <P> The monarch's acceptance, which required the approval of Prime Minister  Margaret Thatcher's government, underlined the extraordinary warmth that has  come to coexist with continued, sharp policy differences in the complex  Soviet-British relationship.  </P> <P> A visit to Moscow by the Queen, the first since her distant relatives of the  Russian royal family were overthrown in the 1917 Russian Revolution, would  represent a highly symbolic endorsement by Britain of the changes that  Gorbachev has wrought in the Soviet system. At the same time, Thatcher's  government hopes that the prospect of the visit will become another incentive  for the transformation to continue.  </P> <P> Earlier Friday, Gorbachev assured several hundred invited dignitaries at  Guildhall, the ornate and historic seat of the City of London's government,  that "there is no turning back" from his program of reform, known in Russian as  perestroika. And he hailed Britain as "the nation whose political experience  has enriched the history of the world."  </P> <P> Thatcher responded by praising the Soviet leader as "one of those rare people  who has the vision, the boldness and the sheer power of personality to change  the whole future of his country, and to have a profound effect on the wider  world as well."  </P> <P> In a subsequent television interview with the British Broadcasting Corp., she  added: "I do think he's a man of destiny."  </P> <P> For all the superlatives, however, Gorbachev's Guildhall speech was a  disappointment to those who had expected him to announce some major new arms  control initiative or to expound his vision of a future "common European home"  for the peoples of East and West.  </P> <P> Instead, he stressed what he described as the bankruptcy of the Cold War  "philosophy of confrontation" and called for a new era of "international  interaction" that will be necessary to solve the "various dangerous and  pressing problems facing mankind."  </P> <P> Continuing the Soviet commitment to reduce weapons arsenals, Gorbachev said, "I  take this opportunity to tell you that we have recently decided to cease this  year the production of enriched weapon-grade uranium."  </P> <P> "In addition to the industrial reactor for the production of weapon-grade  plutonium shut down in 1987," he added, "we plan to shut down two other such  reactors this year and next year without commissioning new units to replace  them. This is yet another major step towards the complete cessation of  production of fissionable materials for use in weapons."  </P> <P> However, independent experts said the Soviets already have a sufficient  stockpile of nuclear materials. Also, materials contained in the warheads of  the medium-range missiles being dismantled under Intermediate-range Nuclear  Forces reduction agreements with the West can be reused.  </P> <P> "I don't think that anybody at this point believes that this will have any  effect on their ability to produce nuclear weapons," commented Hans Bennendyk,  an arms control expert at London's International Institute for Strategic  Studies.  </P> <P> Thatcher told reporters here that the Soviet move "is unlikely to have an  effect for some years," and in Washington, State Department spokesman Richard  Boucher dismissed the announcement, saying at a news briefing that "the  measures will leave the Soviet Union with substantial production capabilities  for nuclear materials."  </P> <P> President Bush, asked at a press conference about Gorbachev's announcement,  replied that he hadn't seen it. But he rejected Gorbachev's criticism of the  day before that the United States is foot-dragging rather than moving forward  with the Soviet Union on arms control and that the Bush Administration is  taking too long with its review of foreign policy.  </P> <P> "Let me simply say we're the United States of America," the President said.  "We're making a prudent review, and I will be ready to discuss that with the  Soviets when we are ready. Mr. Gorbachev knows that there is no foot-dragging  going on . . . ," he said.  </P> <P> In issuing his warning on tactical nuclear weapons, Gorbachev said, "There can  be no doubt that if NATO goes ahead with its (modernization) program, . . .  this is bound to affect the Vienna (conventional arms) talks,  confidence-building measures, and the situation in Europe in general. This is  bound to devalue much of what has been achieved under the INF  (Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces) treaty. . . .  </P> <P> "We strongly oppose any plans for the modernization of nuclear weapons," he  added. "We are not modernizing, nor do we intend to modernize them unless we  are made to."  </P> <P> One British analyst termed Gorbachev's statement "a shot across the bow" of  NATO at a time that both the United States and Britain are pressing the allies  to commit to modernization. They argue that the Soviets have already brought  their tactical nuclear arsenal up to date, leaving NATO far behind. West  Germany, however, wants to postpone the decision, and the debate is expected to  come to a head within the next few weeks.  </P> <P> Underlying the modernization issue is a fundamental difference between Thatcher  and Gorbachev over the future of nuclear weapons. Gorbachev has stated that his  goal is to have a world without such weapons by the year 2000. Thatcher argues  that it will be impossible to put the nuclear "genie" back in the bottle, and  that furthermore, nuclear weapons have been an effective deterrent to war in  Europe for 40 years.  </P> <P> Earlier, the Soviet leader appeared slightly uncomfortable during most of a day  in which he was surrounded by a British pageantry little changed through many  centuries.  </P> <P> Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, were greeted at the entrance to Guildhall by  Christopher Collet, the Lord Mayor of The City, the square-mile area that is  the oldest part of the capital and now mostly its financial district. Collet,  who was robed in blue, gold, and ermine and wore a plumed, tricorn hat, walked  beside the Soviet leader, who wore a dark pinstripe business suit, into the  splendid main chamber. They marched behind more robed men carrying the huge,  ceremonial golden mace and sword as the state trumpeters sounded their arrival.  </P> <P> As he reached his chair next to the podium, Gorbachev began to sit just as the  first notes of the British national anthem were played. He recovered quickly.  </P> <P> He also appeared uncertain on arrival at Windsor Castle, nervously  straightening his coat as he stepped out of his armor-plated Zil limousine to  shake hands with the waiting Queen. He was again out of place for the start of  the national anthem before Prince Philip, the Queen's husband, guided him back  to the proper spot.  </P> <P> Invited to review a battalion of bearskin-capped Coldstream Guards on the  castle's immaculately manicured internal quadrangle, Gorbachev scurried past  the ranks without even looking at the troops in their gray greatcoats on either  side.  </P> <P> He did take an interest during a brief royal tour of the castle in portraits of  Czar Alexander I and half a dozen other Russian military heroes who helped  defeat Napoleon in 1812. He also stopped to admire a huge suit of armor said to  have been made for King Henry VIII.  </P> <P> But Gorbachev seemed his happiest when, for the second time in his brief visit,  he ordered his limousine stopped in downtown London so he could get out and mix  with the crowds of British well-wishers.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Tyler Marshall contributed to this story.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Stella Lee] </F>   [Text] Tougher fire safety regulations for Hong Kong  factory operators are to be adopted by the Guangdong Government.  The new rules are being drafted in an effort to prevent  tragedies such as the Zhili Handicrafts factory fire last  November which killed 84 people and left 25 injured.  Authorities were devising management rules for foreign-owned  enterprises in the province where there are 70,000 such  operations, vice-director of Guangdong Public Security  Department's Fire Bureau, Zhong Jiaorong, said. Eighty per cent  of the foreign-owned enterprises have Hong Kong investors.    Ms Zhong said Guangdong had recorded the nation's highest  number of industrial accidents for four consecutive years.  Fires caused losses of 300 million yuan (HK$266 million) last  year, and 130 million yuan in 1992. Sixty percent of the losses  were attributed to foreign-owned factories. "Although the  foreign-owned enterprises will have to meet the same fire safety  requirements as local ones, the new rules will be tailored for  them," Ms Zhong said.    She was speaking after a seminar on fire safety in  foreign-owned factories, during which a 10-minute video of the  rescue and aftermath of the Zhili fire was shown. The seminar  heard in detail about factors which contributed to the high  death toll including blocked exits, sealed windows and work done  by unlicensed electricians. The fire caused 2.6 million yuan in  damage. Five people, including the Hong Kong owner of the  factory, Lo Chiu-chuen, have been arrested, but no hearing date  has been set.    New penalties came in on March 1, with fines to be  calculated  on the basis of 30,000 yuan per death, 3,000 to 5,000 yuan per  injury, plus one to five percent of the total cost of damage.  Factory management may also face criminal penalties. Chief  executive of the Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions, Lee  Cheuk-yan, called for more compensation for victims of  industrial accidents, and urged the Chinese Government to set up  more channels for workers' complaints.</p>

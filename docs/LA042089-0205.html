			<p><P> April 20, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> EPA CHIEF URGES RADON TESTING OF ALL SCHOOLS  </P> <P> The Environmental Protection Agency urged school officials today to test all  school buildings for radon, saying preliminary tests from 16 states show many  schools have unhealthy levels of the cancer-causing gas.  </P> <P> EPA Administrator William K. Reilly said that although the test results are  only preliminary, the levels found are high enough to warrant nationwide  testing of school buildings.  </P> <P> "It is important that school administrators nationwide understand both the  seriousness of the risk and the relative simplicity of testing and fixing the  problem," Reilly said.  </P> <P> "Based on measurements taken in 3,000 schoolrooms in 16 states, it appears that  elevated levels of radon gas can be found in schools throughout the United  States," Reilly said. He called indoor radon "one of the major environmental  health threats facing Americans."  </P> <P> Radon is a colorless and odorless gas that is produced naturally by the decay  of radium-226 in soil and rocks.  </P></p>

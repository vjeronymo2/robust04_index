			<p><P> June 9, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEFEAT FOR GORBACHEV: LITHUANIAN CONGRESS DEPUTIES WALK OUT  </P> <P> President Mikhail S. Gorbachev suffered his first defeat in the Soviet Union's  new legislature Thursday when most of the deputies from the Baltic republic of  Lithuania walked out to protest what they saw as his attempt to establish a new  constitutional court whose rulings are likely to run counter to Lithuanian  interests.  </P> <P> Gorbachev, nonplussed by the dramatic protest, which was broadcast live on  national television and radio, quickly adjourned the session of the Congress of  People's Deputies in the midst of a vote on the committee's membership. He said  a compromise would be sought overnight with the Lithuanians.  </P> <P> Although there had been previous challenges to his authority during the  two-week parliamentary session, Gorbachev had always managed to prevail --  until Prof. Kazimira-Danute Prunskiene, a respected economist and leading  member of the Lithuanian reform movement Sajudis, gathered her bags and  briefcases, got up and led a procession of more than 50 Lithuanian deputies up  the long aisle out of the Kremlin's Palace of Congresses.  </P> <P> Even after two weeks of tumultuous debate, itself a breakthrough after decades  of cultivated political me-tooism, this was high drama: public defiance of the  country's top leader on a major issue of national importance.  </P> <P> Until now, Gorbachev had assumed, as had most of the nation, that he would  prevail on any crucial issue simply through the force of his personality and  his ability to define and dominate any issue.  </P> <P> Gorbachev appeared stunned, watching in disbelief as most of the Lithuanian  delegation followed Prunskiene. A few deputies from the neighboring Baltic  republics of Estonia and Latvia joined them.  </P> <P> As other deputies began to shout angrily at the Lithuanians, Gorbachev said,  "Comrades, comrades, please be quiet. This is a very serious moment, a critical  moment. We will have to discuss what to do now."  </P> <P> The two basic issues that sparked the protest had arisen several times in the  past two weeks:  </P> <P>  -- Many deputies objected to the way in which the proposed Constitutional  Review Commission, a form of constitutional court, had been formed and its  members nominated.  </P> <P> "Once again, we are faced with a familiar situation -- one name for one job and  no options," Deputy Alexander Obolensky, who challenged Gorbachev for the  presidency simply as a matter of principle, told the congress. "The compilers  of this list are anonymous, we received the list a couple of hours before we  were to vote, there were the briefest of biographies and nothing, absolutely  nothing, on where the proposed members stood on major issues.  </P> <P> "We have no right to proceed; in fact, it would be criminal to consider any of  these appointments until everything has been clarified."  </P> <P>  -- Lithuanian deputies, as well as representatives from the other Baltic  republics and the Ukraine, objected, even more strongly, to the formation of  the commission while the Soviet constitution, now a relic of the politically  discredited era of President Leonid I. Brezhnev, is still in force.  </P> <P> "We need a new constitution, one that takes into account the legitimate  interests of all republics," a Lithuanian deputy said on behalf of the three  Baltic delegations. "We do not need a commission to enforce the old  constitution."  </P> <P> Other questions were raised, including the past political standards of the  candidates as well as their ages, well over 60 for most, although they were  supposed to serve 10-year terms.  </P> <P> "It is all right," Gorbachev said soothingly as more questions were raised. "We  have thought about this."  </P> <P> A Latvian deputy then argued that the whole constitutional process should  begin, much as the American constitution did more than 200 years ago, with the  separate republic's constitutions reflecting particular beliefs and interests  and leading in time to a new national constitution and later to a court that  would enforce its provisions.  </P> <P> As deputies shouted "Autumn, autumn!" and urged postponement of the whole  question until the congress meets again in October, Gorbachev grew very serious  and calmed the congress for several minutes with a frank speech.  </P> <P> "I have a dark and growing suspicion that people are trying to derail the work  of this congress," he said. "We are being pulled into fruitless discussions and  endless debates, but by whom and for what?"  </P> <P> According to Soviet officials, there were 433 votes against the basic proposal  to confirm those whom the leadership had nominated and 61 abstentions -- but  many more, perhaps half, of the 2,250 deputies chose not to participate in the  vote.  </P> <P> After the issue was put off until today, Gorbachev called for a surprise,  closed-door session, the first of the congress, clearing the hall of press,  government officials and other observers and ending the live broadcasts.  Deputies later said that the congress had discussed this week's ethnic riots in  the Soviet Central Asian republic of Uzbekistan.  </P> <P> This adjournment came as tellers were counting the votes for the appointment  for chief state prosecutor. After much controversy, involving a dozen different  court cases, Alexander Sukharev, 66, was confirmed in the post.  </P> <P> Earlier in the day, Nikolai Shmelyev, a leading economist, had told the  congress that the country was headed for an economic crash within three years  unless urgent measures are taken to cut the government's budget deficit and  reverse other policies.  </P> <P> "Over the next two or three years, if we do not stop inflation, the decay of  the consumer market and the monstrous budget deficit, then we face economic  collapse," Shmelyev said.  </P> <P> In a full-scale plan for the nation's economic and fiscal recovery, Shmelyev  proposed a program of $23 billion in imports of consumer goods this year and  next followed by $9 billion a year for several years to satisfy consumer demand  and absorb the "hot money" in the economy.  </P> <P> He supported proposals to pay Soviet farmers in "dollars," or some form of hard  currency, for producing more grain, meat or vegetables than required by state  plan -- and thus saving on imports of agricultural produce.  </P> <P> Shmelyev then ticked off a dozen even more controversial proposals, all  designed to save money and put the economy on a steady footing:  </P> <P>  -- Reduced assistance to Cuba, which now receives the equivalent of $6 billion  a year through inflated Soviet payments for its sugar exports.  </P> <P>  -- The sale of agricultural land to private farmers, who would not only pay  for the title but then invest considerable money developing the land.  </P> <P>  -- Issuance of bonds, at attractive interest rates, to finance capital  investment in major state enterprises.  </P> <P>  -- An end, for at least a decade, to major state development projects, such as  the second Trans-Siberian Railway, which is nearing completion after nearly 20  years of investment.  </P> <P> Shmelyev called for the Congress to be given accurate figures on the country's  finances -- Soviet economists were working largely from figures compiled by  Western intelligence agencies -- and an end to the unquestioning printing of  money whenever the government needs funds to balance its spending.  </P></p>

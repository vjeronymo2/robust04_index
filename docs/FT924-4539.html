			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / World Trade News: Thousands march in protest at EC farm deal STRASBOURG yesterday witnessed a spectacular display of international solidarity for French farmers' opposition to the European Community deal with the US on farm subsidies. However, while most of the 50,000 demonstrators heeded organisers' plea for calm, more than 20 were hurt in clashes with police. One farmer lost a hand as he picked up a tear gas grenade, according to police, and two policemen were taken to hospital, one with a broken leg. The protesters gathered at mid-morning around a bonfire in the Place de Bordeaux before setting off on a 6km-march around the outskirts of the city, in what must be one of the largest ever pan-European labour demonstrations. Every EC member state was represented, and several outside the Community, including Switzerland, Austria, Japan and South Korea. Britain's National Farmers' Union, however, fearful of being blamed for the UK's part in the deal, sent an even smaller delegation than did Japan. By far the biggest non-French presence was an 8,000 strong contingent of Germans. The demonstration began with a festive atmosphere, but when a band of 200 or so marchers, including German and Belgian farmers, veered off-route towards the European Parliament they were met by a line of black helmeted riot police. The marchers uprooted trees, ripped up paving stones and flung rocks and metal bars at the police, who responded with tear gas. Several people were injured on each side before the farmers returned to their agreed route. Clashes erupted for a second time at the end of a mass rally in a soccer stadium, when about 100 farmers fought with riot police by a railway track. Police had been under orders to keep a low profile, and to avoid trouble, even at the cost of some damage to public property. As the marchers passed through mainly deserted streets and shuttered shops, they pushed over parking signs, burned tyres and smashed bus shelters, car windows and cash machines. Police said damage was less than expected. Union leaders' speeches against the deal were drowned by a barrage of fireworks, which lasted throughout the demonstration. Adding to the din was the clanging of cow bells by Swiss, German and French Alpine farmers, the howl of an air raid siren, brought by the Dutch delegation, and the braying of hunting horns. Members of a 130-strong Irish delegation did their best to disavow Mr Ray MacSharry, the Irish European Commissioner who helped negotiate the Gatt deal for a reduction in subsidised EC exports. But marchers' anger appeared directed at several targets, of which the controversial Gatt accord was but one. A multilingual forest of banners and signs variously criticised CAP reform, the European Community, Germany and the US. As one banner confusingly proclaimed: 'Gatt: One Mercedes to the US equals one less European farmer. Danke Schon, Helmut.' Others included 'Gatt-astrophe,' and 'EuroDisney, IBM, Coca-Cola, John Deere, go home.'</p>

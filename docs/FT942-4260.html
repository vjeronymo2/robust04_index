			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Oxford Instruments up 21% A recovery in demand for its products helped Oxford Instruments, the advanced instrumentation group, report a 21 per cent increase in full-year pre-tax profits yesterday. For the 12 months to March 27 profits increased to Pounds 12.8m (Pounds 10.6m) pre-tax. The advance was achieved on turnover up by 11 per cent to Pounds 112m (Pounds 101.1m) reflecting a 22 per cent rise in new orders to Pounds 117m. Some 85 per cent of group sales were made overseas with Japanese sales growing particularly strongly - mostly reflecting volume growth. Earnings per share increased by 13 per cent to 17p (15p), reflecting a slightly higher tax charge of 35.5 per cent (31.6 per cent). A proposed final dividend of 3.4p (3.1p), makes an increased total of 4.9p (4.5p). The shares closed up 27p at 307p. Mr Peter Williams, chairman and chief executive, said, 'while it is too early to talk of long-term sustained recovery in all our markets, orders nevertheless rose in the majority of our businesses although patient monitoring and nuclear measurement continued to experience rather more difficult trading conditions.' Operating profits more than doubled, from Pounds 3.46m to Pounds 7.19m, with the group's core businesses in superconductivity continuing to make the main contribution to profits. Income from the group's 49 per cent stake in Oxford Magnetic Technology, the MRI scanner joint venture with Siemens, slipped to Pounds 5.14m (Pounds 6.05m). Despite the decline, OMT shipped more than 300 magnets last year, and Mr Williams said it represented 'another excellent profit performance.' Interest income fell to Pounds 457,000 (Pounds 1.1m), however the strong cash flow in the second half boosted net cash to Pounds 7.9m, which was slightly higher than a year earlier. COMMENT Oxford managers decided to use most of the benefits of currency movements to trim prices and boost market share last year and one effect was to boost sales per employee by 13 per cent to Pounds 80,400. Profit margins widened from 3.4 to 6.4 per cent but still lag way behind their historic high of 18 per cent. Improving demand should help boost margins back towards these levels, although some businesses, particularly patient monitoring, remain sluggish and very competitive. Meanwhile the group is hopeful a buyer will be found for its second Dollars 25m (Pounds 16m) synchrotron - its has spent Pounds 6.8m on construction so far. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 14.8m look possible producing earnings of 20.1p this year. Given the growth prospects, the shares probably deserve to be trading on a higher forward multiple than the 15.3 they currently command.</p>

			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Steeled for recovery Since British Steel's profits were more or less in line with expectations, its heroic 4 per cent rise in yesterday's sorry equity market must have been due to the doubling of its dividend. But investors may be optimistic if they think such generosity is a harbinger of things to come. Quite apart from the fact that the payout is covered only 1.7 times, the recovery will present new challenges for British Steel which may limit the room for dividend growth. As long as there are no real signs of the capacity problems in Europe being resolved, the next downturn promises to be as brutal as the last. The company must position itself to survive. The primary task is to reduce its dependency on European markets. The planned investment in Tuscaloosa is clearly part of such a strategy, but it will mean an increase in capital spending which has been held down during the recession. British Steel's balance sheet again contains net cash, but it survived the recession as well as it did only thanks to the substantial cash endowment with which it was privatised in 1988. It will need to maintain that balance sheet advantage throughout the recovery. European revival should see British Steel generating handsome amounts of cash. Its UK plant, though, is already operating at between 90 and 95 per cent of manned capacity. More capacity could be created with only relatively modest spend on bottlenecks, but given its complaints about over-supply in Europe, it would look odd for British Steel to add more production. For now the recovery looks likely to be felt more in prices rather than volume. To restore its peak dividend and cover it twice, British Steel's earnings would have to rise five-fold. That may take longer than the market thinks.</p>

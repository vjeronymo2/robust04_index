Vavilov; UDC 551.501.816+551.508.856]    [Abstract] Use of a fluorescent lidar with an excimer laser  for measuring from a distance the thickness of films of  petroleum products on water is considered, determination of the  film thickness involving as usually two measurements of the  fluorescence intensity of water twice: with and without the  film. The principle of this method is based on the dependence of  the hydrooptical properties, reflectivity and absorptivity, on  the film thickness. These relations were studied experimentally  with an XeCl-laser exciting the films with 308 nm radiation.  Both absorption and emission spectra of various petroleum  products, lubricants and fuels in cyclohexane solution, were  measured in a spectrophotometer. The fluorescence intensity of  such films on water was measured with a laboratory apparatus  which included this XeCl laser and an aligning it He-Ne laser,  two photomultipliers, a pyroelectric radiation receiver, an  MDR-4 monochromator with a spectrally 2 nm wide slit, and four  objectives consisting each of a mating biconvex and  concavo-plane lens pair. A rotating wedge diverted a part of the  excitation beam through either the first objective into the  first photomultiplier or through the second objective into the  pyroelectric radiation receiver. A right-angle prism reflected  the remaining part of the excitation radiation through the third  objective into the test cell with a specimen. A rotating plane  mirror reflected the radiation from the fluorescing specimen  through the fourth objective and then the monochromator into the  second photomultiplier. Tests were performed on successively  3-9-15-30 m thick films, with an XeCl-laser emitting  radiation in pulses of 30 mJ energy and 30 ns duration at an  either 0.1 Hz or 0.25 Hz repetition rate. Fluorescence was  recorded within the 320-410 nm band, the maximum fluorescence  signal shifting farter into the long-wave region as a light  petroleum product was being replaced with successively heavier  ones. With increasing film thickness, the fluorescence signal  normalized to the Raman scattering signal was found to increase  up to the fluorescence saturation level. Therefore, use of an  excimer laser is recommended only for thin (d &lt; 15 m)  films  of petroleum products on water. Figures 3; references 9.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (c) The information listed in paragraph (c)(1) thru (5) (similar to that required by 28 CFR 14.4(b) (DA Pam 27&hyph;162, appendix H)) will be submitted by a claimant to substantiate a personal injury claim: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Written report by the attending physician or dentist setting forth the_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Nature and extent of injury. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Nature and extent of treatment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Degree of temporary or permanent disability. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Prognosis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) Period of hospitalization. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vi) Diminished earning capacity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Itemized bills or receipts for medical, dental, and hospital expenses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) If the prognosis includes future treatment, a statement of expected expenses for such treatment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) If the claim includes lost time from employment, a statement by the employer showing the actual time lost and wages and/or salary lost. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) If the claim includes lost income by a self-employed claimant, documentary evidence of such loss. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.58 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Measure of damages in injury or death claims arising in foreign countries. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Where a claim for an injury, or injury resulting in death, arises outside of the United States or its possessions, the elements of damages payable under this subpart will be the same as those payable in a similar claim arising under the law of the District of Columbia applicable to torts committed in and having their operative effect in the District of Columbia. The amount paid will be based on generally accepted economic principles. All awards for future payments of economic damages will be discounted to present value. Awards under this subpart will be reduced by any benefits which have been or are reasonable likely to be paid, if the benefit or payment is from the general revenues of the United States and the claimant did not contribute to or purchase the benefit. In death cases, taxes and personal consumption will be deducted from any award for lost economic contribution or lost earnings. Punitive or exemplary damages, including damages considered punitive in nature under 28 U.S.C. 2674, and interest on any settlement are not payable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The information listed in &sect;536.57(b) or (c), as appropriate, will be submitted by the claimant to substantiate a claim. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) A claimant who alleges a serious personal injury resulting in temporary or permanent disability should be examined by an independent physician or other medical specialist. The purpose of the examination is not just to confirm the impairment but also to help assess its extent, prognosis and treatment. See &sect;536.27 for independent medical examination procedures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.59 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Failure to substantiate a claim. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) The Government is not obligated to take final action on a claim until it has been supported by the claimant with specific facts substantiated by appropriate documentary evidence, reports of investigation, medical records, or witness statements. As the burden of proof is on the claimant, the failure to substantiate a claim within a reasonable time can be the basis for denial of the claim. Upon request, the claimant must_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Provide the documentation required by &sect;&sect;536.56 through 536.58. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Undergo necessary medical examinations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Permit questioning of the claimant, his or her witnesses, and treating medical personnel. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Submit an expert opinion in a professional negligence action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Failure to comply with these requirements may provide a basis for denial of a claim, in full or in part. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

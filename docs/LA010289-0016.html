			<p><P> January 2, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> A provincial court in Egypt has ordered the television series "Falcon Crest"  off the air on grounds it undermines public morals, according to a newspaper  report. The newspaper Wafd, published by a centrist opposition party of the  same name, said Thursday the ruling banning the show was in a provincial court  in the Nile Valley town of Shibin el-Kom. "Falcon Crest" began appearing  several years ago on local television and quickly became a favorite among both  poor and wealthy Egyptians, despite its depiction of a society generally  foreign to the mostly conservative Egyptians. Television censors, for example,  routinely cut kissing scenes from "Falcon Crest" that they consider too  passionate. The TV series "Dallas," a predecessor of "Falcon Crest," also was  widely popular until it was stopped six years ago after a member of parliament  complained it was corrupting the morals of Egyptian youth.

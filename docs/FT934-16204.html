			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Kelt Energy stake for Kerry Packer KELT ENERGY, the oil exploration and production company, is raising Pounds 5m through a share subscription and open offer under which Mr Kerry Packer's CP International Securities, could take a maximum 14.8 per cent stake in the company. CPI, a subsidiary of the Australian entrepreneur's Consolidated Press International Holdings, is subscribing for up to 12.5m shares at 40p each. The deal is part of CPI's expansion into the energy and petrochemical industries. Ordinary and preference shareholders can subscribe on a 1-for-11.174 basis. Two companies held by Mr Hubert Perrodo, chairman of Kelt, will not take up their entitlements, totalling 12.2 per cent of the enlarged capital, in favour of CPI. Mr Perrodo's stake in Kelt, which was restructured two years ago when a group of banks took over some of its exploration and production assets in return for writing off its debt, will fall to a little more than 55 per cent. Mr Jean-Michel Runacher, chief executive, said the subscription was the first step towards the further dilution of Mr Perrodo's stake. Additional steps to broaden the shareholder base can be expected. Since its restructuring Kelt has specialised in taking over marginal assets from large oil companies and cutting costs in order to make them profitable. Yesterday Mr Perrodo said the strategy had enabled Kelt to double its production over the past six months to 11,050 barrels of oil equivalent a day.</p>

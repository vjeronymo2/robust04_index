			<p><P> April 2, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH;  </P> <P> CITY JOINS PROFITABLE ANTI-DRUG PROGRAM  </P> <P> An extra officer will be added to Seal Beach's police force to allow the city  to join a profitable narcotics suppression program without detracting from its  current patrol force of 42 officers.  </P> <P> Cities participating in the Regional Narcotics Suppression Program, which began  in 1986, have received an average of $250,000 a year in shared assets seized  from drug dealers, Capt. Ken Garrett said.  </P> <P> He said only four of Orange County's 23 police agencies are not participating  in the program, which has been responsible for 136 arrests and the seizure of  more than $57.7 million in cash and other assets.  </P> <P> The City Council approved the temporary addition of the new officer, who will  receive $48,000 annually and will be assigned to the program. City Manager  Robert Nelson said the Police Department will consider permanently funding the  position at its mid-year budget review in June.  </P> <P> According to Garrett, within two years "this position will be fully financed by  our share of assets seized from major narcotics traffickers."  </P> <P> "This project is known on an international basis," Nelson said. "The success of  the team is proven. There is a chance of gaining funds (by participating). Let  the drug dealers pay for our officers." MICHELLE NICOLOSI  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Guards Lieutenant-Colonel Volodymyr Korkodym: </F> "In Accordance With the Laws of Ukraine"]    [Text] Subunits of the National Guard of Ukraine [NHU]  stationed in the Crimea are continuing to carry out, as before,  the task of safeguarding public order as stipulated by law.  According to a previously approved plan that was coordinated  with internal-affairs bodies, details of Guardsmen without  weapons are going out into the streets of Simferopol at night to  protect the citizenry against criminal infringements. Classes in  combat training are also continuing according to the usual plan.  Topics are being practiced in particular that are envisaged by  the training program for cleaning up the consequences of a  natural disaster.    Some of the mass media, however, have tried to inflame the  situation surrounding the units of the National Guard of  Ukraine, which have been located in Crimea since 1992. All kinds  of gossip surrounding BTRs [armored personnel carriers] that  have arrived on the peninsula is spreading. The press service of  the NHU command has been authorized to announce that the  military hardware has returned to its units after the planned  seasonal repairs at a plant. The means of transport on hand in  the subunits are only 14 percent of the necessary standard  quantity. Insinuations aimed at creating tensions around a  military unit that is being formed in accordance with the Law of  Ukraine "The National Guard of Ukraine" thus seem curious.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Our Opinion" station editorial by Orlando Contreras] </F>   [Text] The National Assembly of the People's Government  [ANPP] will hold on May Day a special session convened by the  Council of State to analyze the national financial situation.  This will thus close a process which included the entire nation  at the grass-roots level -- an unprecedented popular  consultation through the conduit of forms of democracy unlike  those frequently imposed as the only form of government by the  hegemonic centers of power.    On the basis of these considerations involving the conduit  of  democracy and the clear differentiation of that conduit, the  problem to be debated tomorrow by our deputies is directly tied  to one of the main challenges -- not the only one -- of our  economy: A currency excess nearing 12 billion pesos.    This means that there is an enormous surplus between the  purchasing potential and the actual supply of products and  services available. Technically, when this happens, the  purchasing power of the currency drops to such extremes that it  is not able to regain its capacity through a rational increase  in production. In our case, the shortage of energy, oil, and a  series of resources due to well-known reasons, does not allow  for a significant increase in production.    The excess currency is one of the financial problems of our  economy -- not the only one. There are others tied to the  collection of currency through diverse fiscal measures also  affecting the required financial balance.    Measures have been taken regarding this extremely urgent  matter, such as the reorganization of the administrative  apparatus of the central government. However, in our case, we  have to find solutions without implementing shock policies; in  other words, without massive layoffs, and acute increases in  prices to lower the excess currency and attain a healthy but  socially unfair demand.    This is what it is all about. We have to adopt the measures  needed without abandoning the social character of the function  of the state in the economy. Social, not only due to the nature  of production but also due to the final beneficiary of the  national economy.    The deputies have before them an urgent task. This process  will probably not end with this special session. It is a matter  of taking indispensable steps to redesign our economy on an  economically feasible basis without affecting the workers  unfairly or massively. The Revolution will not leave anyone  abandoned. That is an unquestionable principle.</p>

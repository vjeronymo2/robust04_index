			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Response to Daf collapse attacked THE GOVERNMENT'S response to the collapse of Daf, the Dutch truckmaker, came under fierce attack in the Commons yesterday, with Labour claiming it highlighted its lack of an industrial strategy, David Owen writes. Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, said the government's approach contrasted with that of its Belgian and Dutch counterparts, which were intervening to save local jobs. Predicting that thousands of jobs would be lost if the British-based Leyland Daf went down, Mr Cook asked why, as of last week, there had been no 'ministerial contact from Britain' with the Dutch finance minister while a rescue package was being worked on. 'If you will not even talk to the Dutch government, you are making it more likely that the cuts will fall on British jobs,' Mr Cook said. Flanders offer, Page 26</p>

			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Whitbread wanted Results from Whitbread were well received, the 'A' shares forging ahead 19 to 519p in brisk turnover of 2.1m. The strong showing by the retail division prompted some big investors to hook into the stock as a recovery play, although some specialists were taking a more cautious view. Some expressed concern that the group's brewing business remained under a cloud and would restrict any growth potential from the retail side. However, this did not discourage the stock's supporters, who pointed out that the company is well placed for a consumer-led recovery. Forecasts for the full year were trimmed to a range of Pounds 232m to Pounds 240m. Pharmaceutical group Wellcome fell on negative comments in a television programme which examined legal action Wellcome could face from families of children allegedly damaged more than 20 years ago by the whooping cough vaccine it manufactured. The stock slid 17 to 649p and others in the pharmaceuticals sector were dragged back in its wake. Glaxo lost 7 to 651p and Zeneca 13 to 774p. News and electronic information group Reuters Holdings rose 10 to 1654p after gains in the US on Wednesday night. Lloyds Bank was the pick of the banking sector, advancing 10 to 580p, with BZW said to have recommended the shares after the 'yes' vote on Nafta in the US congress on Wednesday evening. Dealers said the buy note reflected perceptions that the value of Lloyds' substantial Mexican debt could rise considerably as Mexico participated freely in the economic recovery in North America. Dealers also said that Lloyds had continued to benefit from its yield premium over other leading UK banks. HSBC opened sharply higher as the Hong Kong market performed better than many London traders had expected after Morgan Stanley's big downgrade of its Hong Kong market rating. But the firmer trend was quickly eroded and HSBC shares retreated from an initial 744p to close a net penny off at 733p after another hefty turnover of 5.8m. Standard Chartered also performed well, finishing 16 stronger at 1053p. A much better tone permeated a merchant banking area given a rough ride by the market since the splendid figures recently announced by Hambros and SG Warburg. Hambros moved up 2 to 360p and Warburg 10 to 850p. Whitbread's results helped other big brewery and restaurant groups, with Allied-Lyons advancing 11 to 572p and Scottish &amp; Newcastle 6 to 475p. Ladbroke rallied from its recent mauling, improving 3 to 159p. First Leisure remained dull, slipping a penny to 235p, in spite of a strong buy note from Credit Lyonnais Laing. Airtours rose 13 to 446p on talk of good bookings for 1994. Results from Storehouse, the fashion retailer, were better than expected which, together with an upbeat statement, helped the shares jump 17 to 200p. However, analysts expressed slight disappointment with the unchanged dividend. Market forecasts for the full year clustered around the Pounds 65m mark. There was another surge in the price of Lloyds Chemist, the shares climbing 13 to 306p, a rise of 40 in the past two weeks. Analysts have attributed the strength to the shares' underperformance and speculation that the Budget could reveal prescription charge increases. Profit-taking shaved 5 from Boots to 520p. House broker Hoare Govett was said to be behind a rise in Tate &amp; Lyle, which reports results next week. The shares moved ahead 13 to 391p. Yield considerations lifted Booker 5 to 403p. Among food retailers, Argyll Group's recovery continued, the stock adding 6 at 277p. Kwik Save was under further pressure ahead of results expected next week, although the shares recovered to close steady at 577p. J. Sainsbury appreciated 7 to 386p. In spite of an announcement that investors had shied away from an open offer from Aegis Group, Europe's biggest media-buying network, the shares held steady at 19p. An offer of 231m new ordinary shares at 20p apiece was only 14 per cent taken up, while an offer for 68.2m new preference shares at 22p was 7 per cent taken up. Union Discount firmed a penny to 170p in spite of news that Newton Investment Management had sold 2.3m shares, equivalent to a 12.3 per cent stake, in the company. Ugland, the former Bristol Channel Ship Repairers, moved forward 8 to 108p on its market debut. Racal Electronics came under renewed pressure after a sizeable agency cross and talk that one influential broking house had adopted a persistently bearish stance on the shares. The stock closed 14 lower at 198p after turnover of 6.5m shares.</p>

			<p><P> October 4, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> GATES CHARGES BORDER LEAKS LIKE A SIEVE FOR HEAVY FLOW OF COCAINE  </P> <P> A southern border leaking like a sieve allowed a record 20 tons of cocaine into  Southern California and also threatens national security, Police Chief Daryl F.  Gates told the City Council today.  </P> <P> Gates, discussing the Police Department's role in last week's record seizure of  cocaine, said the nation's borders must be secured before such shipments can be  halted.  </P> <P> "If you have been to the border and seen what has been going on there it is a  disgrace, a national disgrace," Gates said.  </P> <P> Gates and Councilman Hal Bernson urged the use of the armed forces to seal the  border and cut off the flow of illicit drugs into the United States.  </P> <P> "It's been my belief for a long time that the armed forces have to be  involved," Gates said.  </P> <P> The chief also reviewed how the Police Department came to be involved in the  case in which 20 tons of cocaine and $12.4 million in cash were confiscated  from a Sylmar warehouse late last week.  </P> <P> Police worked with the federal Drug Enforcement Administration and members of a  narcotics task force representing several smaller Southern California cities in  tracking the shipments to the warehouse, Gates said.  </P></p>

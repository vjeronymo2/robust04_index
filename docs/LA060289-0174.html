			<p><P> June 2, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> GRAF EASES HER WAY INTO FOURTH ROUND;  </P> <P> BECKER ADVANCES; MAYOTTE UPSET BY HAITIAN IN PARIS  </P> <P> Defending champion Steffi Graf, playing through a steady drizzle, eased her way  into the fourth round of the French Open tennis championships today, beating  Nicole Jagerman of the Netherlands 6-1, 6-2.  </P> <P> Seventh-seeded American Tim Mayotte, who resumed play today after his  second-round match was suspended by darkness Thursday, was upset by Ronald  Agenor of Haiti, 3-6, 7-5, 5-7, 7-5, 6-2.  </P> <P> Boris Becker's bid for a fourth-round spot in the men's event was delayed by  rain today. But after a 5 1/2-hour wait, the second-seeded West German resumed  his match against qualifier Jeremy Bates and crushed the Briton 7-5, 6-1, 6-2.  </P> <P> "It's terrible when you have to wait like that. It's almost like in England,"  Becker said. "But for me, I guess the rain was pretty good. Until then, I was  too defensive."  </P> <P> The showers had the opposite effect on Mayotte, a grass-court expert playing on  his least favorite surface. He was leading Agenor, two sets to one, and was at  3-3 in the fourth set when the match was suspended.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Best Played on Clay'  </P> <P> Agenor, ranked 30th in the world, who proved the stronger when the match  finally was resumed today.  </P> <P> "Today, he played almost picture perfect tennis," Mayotte said. "He made  passing shots, lobs and serves that he didn't do yesterday. I'm obviously  disappointed, but it's the best I've played on clay."  </P> <P> Unseeded Jay Berger of Plantation, Fla., reached the fourth round as he whipped  Jaime Yzaga of Peru 6-4, 6-2, 6-2.  </P> <P> And Spain's Conchita Martinez, seeded eighth, joined Graf in the same stage of  the women's event by rolling over Sophie Amiach of France 6-3, 6-3.  </P> <P> Graf, the defending women's titlist, took exactly one hour on Center Court to  overpower Jagerman, and has now dropped only six games in three matches.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cold, Gray Gloom  </P> <P> The 19-year-old Grand Slam champion had one or two rare lapses, such as when  she was broken at love in the sixth game of the second set, but was generally a  class above her opponent.  </P> <P> After four days of sunshine, the temperature dropped considerably at Roland  Garros and the stadium was enveloped in a cold, gray gloom.  </P> <P> "It was awfully cold. I tried to finish it as soon as possible," the top-seeded  Graf said. "I was very lucky to play first, before the rain. At the end, it was  very hard."  </P> <P> Graf's match was played in persistent drizzle, and as soon as it was over  officials covered the Center Court with a tarpaulin to protect the clay.  </P> <P> Because of the rain delay, officials postponed a number of key matches for 24  hours, hoping for an improvement in the weather Saturday.  </P> <P> The matches between Jimmy Arias and Stefan Edberg, Nicole Provis and Gabriela  Sabatini, Jacob Hlasek and Leonardo Lavalle and Alberto Mancini and Paul  Haarhuis all were held over until Saturday.  </P> <P> In another rain-interrupted match completed this evening, No. 16 Guillermo  Perez-Roldan of Argentina beat Italy's Francesco Cancellotti 7-6, 2-6, 7-5,  4-6, 6-2.  </P> <P> In the women's field, No. 10 Helen Kelesi of Canada defeated Gretchen Magers of  the United States 6-4, 2-6, 6-3.  </P></p>

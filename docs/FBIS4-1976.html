			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Mo Fei (5459 7236)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 22 Mar (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- Guangdong  has already drafted a great blueprint for building expressways  in the next 20 years.    When attending the "two sessions" in Beijing, Guangdong  Governor Zhu Senlin, a deputy to the National People's Congress  [NPC], responded to a reporter's question and said that there is  a long-term plan of transportation construction in Guangdong.    In order to coordinate with the state's relevant planning  and  to meet the need of Guangdong's economic development, Guangdong  has decided to build a dozen expressways over a period of 15 to  20 years, which will have a total length of about 3,300 km, to  penetrate to the eastern, western, and northern parts of  Guangdong so as to form a network of roads converging on the  state's main roads, and linking key cities, transportation hubs,  and ports in the province.    The above-mentioned project will require more than 100  billion yuan, and this year over 10 billion yuan will be  injected to it.    Zhu Senlin said that the funds for building expressways will  be raised by Guangdong's own efforts, and come from accumulated  capital. Some foreign funds will also be used.    The expressways for which contracts have been signed with  foreign firms, and on which construction has already begun or  will soon begin so that they can be completed by 1996, include:  The 154-km Guangzhou-Shenzhen east route, which is under  construction; the 140-km Shenzhen-Shantou east route; the 66-km  Huizhou-Heyuan route; the 150-km Yangjiang-Zhuhai coastal  expressway; the 146-km Shenzhen-Shantou west route; and the  80-km Foshan-Kaiping expressway.    Letters of intent have also been signed with foreign  businessmen to build another four expressways, namely, the  Guangdong section of the Beijing-Guangzhou expressway,  Guangzhou-Huidong expressway, Kaiping-Yangjiang expressway, and  Yangjiang-Zhanjiang expressway; according to plan, construction  will begin next year and will be completed by 1998-1999.    At present, Guangdong ranks first among provinces and  regions  in construction of roads, and this is also true in terms of road  density. In the area of building transportation facilities such  as railways, airports, and ports, Guangdong has also made  eye-catching achievements.    Zhu Senlin said that these big inputs are for enabling  Guangdong to cast off the "bottleneck" restraint which has  hindered Guangdong's capital construction for a long time, so  that good conditions can be created for Guangdong's future  development.</p>

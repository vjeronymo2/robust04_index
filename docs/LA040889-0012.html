			<p><P> April 8, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EXXON OIL SPILL AND HIGHER GAS PRICES  </P> <P> Murkowski's column confirms the shameful fact that we are a nation of oil  junkies. We are willing to spoil pristine wilderness, destroy innocent wildlife  and befoul our atmosphere with lung-choking hydrocarbons to feed our habit.  </P> <P> If we stop pulling oil from Alaska we do not have to get it from foreign oil  pushers. What we do have to do is embark on a national program of increased  energy efficiency and alternative energy sources. The possibilities are there,  all we need is a little imaginative leadership. All we need to do is stare the  oil conglomerates in the eye and "just say no."  </P> <P> SCOTT HERBERTSON  </P> <P> Los Angles  </P></p>

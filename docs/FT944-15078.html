			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Tories 'held talks on gerrymandering': First day of Westminster City Council probe hears claims of social engineering objective Senior Tory councillors and officials of Westminster City Council discussed the 'economic justification for gerrymandering', according to handwritten notes by its housing director, the public inquiry into the council's housing policies was told yesterday. The allegations were made during the first day of public hearings held by Mr John Magill, the council's district auditor. The hearings follow his provisional findings announced in January that six councillors and four council officials should be surcharged Pounds 21.25m for their part in alleged 'gerrymandering' of council house sales. A group of Labour councillors and local residents who objected to the policy claim that council homes in eight marginal wards were sold off to bolster the Conservative vote in the 1990 local elections. Mr Andrew Arden QC, representing the objectors, told the hearing that Mr Graham England, the housing director, took notes of a working lunch on June 30 1986 which was attended by four leading councillors, including Dame Shirley Porter, the then leader. He said Mr England's notes of the discussion included references to 'economic justification for gerrymandering on housing', 'who is a Tory voter', and 'but will company lets vote Tory?' Mr Arden said: 'This is an extraordinary, bizarre and frankly improper conversation to be recorded by a director of housing.' Mr England is one of the 10 individuals provisionally recommended for the surcharge. Mr Arden also quoted from a series of interviews with councillors and officials which had been carried out by Mr Magill during his four-year investigation. He said that these interviews showed that the council was being run as a 'triumvirate' by Dame Shirley, Mr Barry Legg, her chief whip at the time and now Conservative MP for Milton Keynes SW, and Mr David Weeks, her then deputy. He quoted an interview with Mr Anthony Prendergast, a long-serving Conservative councillor, who said that after the 1986 local elections the council was being run by a 'cabal' which told the backbenchers what to do. Mr Arden said the interviews showed that the result of the May 1986 election, in which the Conservatives' majority was reduced to four, had given them a 'great shock'. He also focused on a set of notes made by Mr England on June 24 that year, this time of a special meeting of chief council officials which was addressed by Dame Shirley, Mr Legg, and Mr Weeks. Mr England recorded that one of the objectives of the Tory majority group was 'social engineering including housing'. Mr Arden said the respondents would 'no doubt' argue about this term in the coming weeks of the hearings, but he said their arguments would not be well-founded. He said a council should serve those who already lived there, not 'select the electorate they wish to serve'. He added that a council should not 'bribe people into an area by selling them discounted housing or push people out either'. Dame Shirley, who contests the charges, appeared at the hearings but did not speak. Before entering she told journalists: 'This is not justice.' She said the shouts of protesters outside the hearings showed that she had been 'judged guilty before this inquiry'. Once inside the hearings, held in the council's chamber on London's Marylebone Road, she laughed when Mr Magill said: 'I have reached no decision adverse to any individual.' The hearings continue today and are expected to last for about six weeks.</p>

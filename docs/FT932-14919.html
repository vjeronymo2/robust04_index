			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Shell cuts gallon of petrol by 13.6p SHELL last night cut the maximum price of its petrol by 13.6p a gallon, in effect wiping out the increase caused by the increase in fuel tax in the Budget, David Lascelles writes. Shell's move follows price cuts two weeks ago by Esso and BP. However Shell said many of its stations were already selling petrol at the lower price because of local competition. Falling petrol prices have been made possible by the strength of sterling against the dollar and the resulting drop in the sterling price of oil. Shell's new maximum recommended prices are 226.9p for a gallon of unleaded and 249.6p for 4-star leaded. BP said last night that it intended to remain competitive, although no decision on a further price cut had been taken.</p>

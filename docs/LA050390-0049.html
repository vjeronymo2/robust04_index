			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUR STAMPS: PULASKI COMMEMORATIVES WERE ISSUED IN 1931  </P> <P> Question: I have a full sheet of the 2-cent Gen. Pulaski U.S. stamp of, I  believe, the 1930s. What is this sheet worth? -- E.C.  </P> <P> Answer: Maybe $10 or more. You probably have a pane instead of a sheet of  stamps. This 2-cent commemorative honoring the Polish patriotic hero of the  American Revolution was issued in panes of 100 stamps, after being printed from  a printing plate of 400 stamps -- four panes, which were then cut apart. (What  most people call sheets are really panes -- the typical format of stamps  purchased at the post office.) The first day of issue date was Jan. 16, 1931,  and the Post Office Department issued more than 90 million of these stamps, so  they are not especially scarce today. The margin plate block of 6 with plate  number attached, worth $5 to $10 retail, is the real value item in this pane.  If you have a perfectly centered undamaged plate block, it is worth more than  all the rest of the 94 stamps in the pane. Singles of the Pulaski issue retail  for a dime each.  </P> <P> Q: I need an honest appraiser and dealer to buy my collection of Israeli  stamps, which had a retail value of $3,500 in 1970-71. Ready to sell. Daughter  to college. Please advise. -- J.W.  </P> <P> A: Depending, of course, on which Israeli issues you have, it is quite possible  that your collection, which retailed for $3,500 about 20 years ago, has  appreciated in value since then. Select two dealers from the Yellow Pages and  visit them with your stamps, saying that you want to sell outright, and ask for  a wholesale appraisal. If their offers are similar, they are probably giving  you a fair price. Call first to be certain they are interested in your  material.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Stamp News  </P> <P> A new biography, "Rowland Hill, Genius and Benefactor, 1795-1879" by Colin G.  Hey, has just been published. Hill is generally credited with having invented  the postage stamp, Great Britain's Penny Black, in 1840.  </P> <P> He also persuaded British postal authorities to lower postal rates drastically,  demonstrating by arguments and statistics that the savings allowed by low  prepaid postage stamps would reduce postal workers' time and labor so much that  the resulting postal revenues would actually increase.  </P> <P> And that is what happened. The printing presses couldn't keep up with the  demand for the new postage stamps. On the first day, large crowds poured into  the streets of London to celebrate the introduction of cheap uniform postage  rates, and the police had to be called in to keep traffic routes open. Queen  Victoria honored the event by renouncing her free-franking privilege, which  allowed her to send mail for free (as U.S. congressmen still do, with their  printed signature in lieu of postage on the envelope).  </P> <P> Although it doesn't deal only with postal matters, this new biography of  Rowland Hill, whose name is synonymous with early British philately, treats  many interesting aspects and accomplishments of his life. Available for $19.95  at B. Dalton and Waldenbooks stores, or directly from the publisher: Scott  Publishing Co., 911 Vandemark Road, Sidney, Ohio 45365.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Stamp Calendar  </P> <P> May 4-6: ORCOEXPO "Spring 90" stamp show, Sheraton/Anaheim Hotel, 1015 W.

			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Collecting: Jewels from the East - Susan Moore welcomes an upcoming feast of Oriental art ON TUESDAY, Eskenazi unveils the latest in a long line of spectacular and scholarly Oriental art exhibitions to celebrate the gallery's move from a first floor in London's Piccadilly to a five-storey 'Flemish Renaissance' townhouse off Bond Street, at No. 10 Clifford Street. The acquisition and refurbishment of the building cost in excess of Pounds 5m and is an expression of confidence all the more striking given that Eskenazi has no English clients. The old premises in Foxglove House afforded no storage space, no room for parallel exhibitions and inadequate wall space for the extensive library. The restored 1897 facade of Clifford Street belies an imaginative, purpose-built interior of some 12,000 sq ft. There are two gallery floors, divided front and back to offer up to four independent exhibition spaces. Moveable, free-standing showcases provide maximum flexibility. A pool of natural light is brought to the heart of a once gloomy, narrow building by a new atrium. Natural materials have been chosen throughout: blond sycamore, French limestone, glass. The effect is cool, airy and meditative. For the new gallery, Giuseppe Eskenazi envisions more exhibitions (there have already been 36 in the last decade), including loan shows, and 'symposia or anything which might interest academics'. For him, the new building is also 'my way of showing my commitment to London'. When he left Milan to open a London office of the family firm of Oriental art dealers in 1960, London was the undisputed capital of the art world. Thirty years on, and thanks to the arguably short-sighted policies of the auction houses which now move objects around the world to offer them in their primary markets, it has become just one important centre as Hong Kong and New York have come to rival it in the Oriental art market. But Eskenazi believes London still retains the trump card of unrivalled expertise - in its museums, universities and art trade. Significantly, Oriental art is one of the few markets in which the auction houses have failed to wrest the biggest business from the hands of a small group of top international dealers. Eskenazi may have no English clients, but it claims the third highest turnover of any London dealers. In 1991-92 that was some Pounds 18.5m, a huge sum in Oriental terms. Eskenazi's inaugural show is 'Early Chinese Art from Tombs and Temples' (June 8-July 9). Some 48 works of art, from a Shang bronze of the 12th-11th century BC to a Song or Jin wood Bodhisattva of the 12th-13th century AD, have been selected to represent the breadth and quality of the gallery's holdings. Collectors with deep pockets will be delighted to find that a number of prize rarities have been extracted from the company collection. 'We are selling things we had no intention of parting with', says Eskenazi. Notable among the highlights is an unusually large and superbly modelled recumbent bronze ox of the Eastern Zhou period (4th-3rd century BC), inlaid with scrolls of silver. A partial inscription states that it belonged to the state treasury of an unknown king. From the Tang dynasty comes a sumptuous silver reliquary, a vigorous glazed earthenware horse biting its knee and an imposing amphora, 68cm high, streaked with a sancai glaze of cream, green and chestnut. Most examples are half its size. 'Japanese Netsuke from the Carre Collection' also goes on show, June 15-July 9. The 243 pieces reflect the collector's particular fascination with the folklore of Japan, a subject illustrated so effectively by the netsuke craftsmen. Another inaugural show also features a single-owner collection. Swiss dealer Patrick Syz, formerly of Sarzi-Amade in Bond Street, opens as a private dealer at No. 94 Eaton Place, London SW1 (tel: 071-235-4572) with an admirable if highly specialist show. He presents 92 of the finest examples of Japanese sword fittings, or tsuba, from the collection of the American Henry D. Rosin, June 10-25. 'It is said to be probably the finest, small, concise collection outside Japan,' Syz says modestly. Prices Pounds 500 to Pounds 60,000. Barry Davies Oriental Art (1 Davies Street, London W1) presents no less than three shows this month, June 12-25. 'Inro - One Hundred Selected Masterpieces' draws from a number of well-known collections. Its star turn is a 'truly spectacular' unrecorded inro (a small, decorative container worn from the belt) by Shibata Zeshin, probably the greatest 19th century Japanese lacquer artist. This unusual piece takes the form of a wicker basket in polished black lacquer which contains three fitted gold lacquer boxes. A second show introduces the contemporary Japanese lacquer artist, Unryuan, whose Togidashi work of different coloured rubbed lacquers is hailed as fine as anything produced in the 18th century. At Pounds 4,000 to Pounds 60,000, it is certainly as expensive. Complementing his work is a small display by the English contemporary netsuke carver, Guy Shaw. More netsuke are to be found at Sydney L. Moss (51 Brook Street, London W1). 'Zodiac Beasts and Distant Cousins', which shows June 9-July 2, focuses around a group of 12 wood animals by the Gifu/Nagoya masters, Tomakazu and Ikkan. A far wider selection of Oriental and South East Asian wares - including bronze, ivory, lacquer, cloisonne, pottery and porcelain, glass, soapstone and textiles - is to be found at The Oriental Art Gallery's summer bonanza, 4 Davies Street, from June 8. Most notable is a group of Ming and Qing Imperial lacquers. Spink's Far Eastern show, 5-7 King Street, London SW1, until June 18, for the first time includes a significant group of Korean ceramics - far more rare than their Chinese and Japanese counterparts. Outstanding among the exhibits is an 18th century Choson Dynasty blue and white porcelain brush pot sparely decorated with a continuous landscape under a full moon. Prices Pounds 1,500 to Pounds 200,000. Christie's, meanwhile, exhibits 118 pieces from the collection of Chinese ceramics amassed by the Hong Kong dealer Robert Chang (until June 15). This is a gloriously old-fashioned collection of flashy, brilliantly coloured and finely potted wares which reflect the re-emergence of taste for late Qing Imperial porcelains in the Hong Kong of the 1970s and 1980s.</p>

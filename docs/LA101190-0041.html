			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, Nuestro Tiempo Edition  </P> <P> LOS LOBOS RETURNS TO OLD HAUNTS ON NEW LP  </P> <P> One reason Los Lobos took so long to record its new album, "The Neighborhood,"  was, ironically, the huge success of the East Los Angeles-spawned quintet's "La  Bamba" single.  </P> <P> The group's last album of original songs -- 1987's "By the Light of the Moon"  -- was a dark, moving series of tales about the troubled pursuit of the  American Dream, seen inescapably through a barrio perspective.  </P> <P> Arguably the most culturally arresting and musically embracing work by a Los  Angeles-based group in nearly a decade, the graceful, warm-spirited collection  sold a respectable 400,000 copies and was named to the year-end Top 10 lists of  numerous critics.  </P> <P> Yet "Moon" was almost totally eclipsed in the public mind by the runaway  success a few months later of Los Lobos' next recording venture: several songs  for the soundtrack of "La Bamba," the film biography of '50s Mexican-American  rock star Ritchie Valens. The soundtrack album sold more than 2 million copies,  and Los Lobos' title track spent weeks at No. 1 on the pop charts.  </P> <P> The natural thing from a commercial standpoint would have been for Los Lobos to  return with another collection of oldies. But that would have meant setting  aside the compelling vision that made "Moon" and the earlier "How Will the Wolf  Survive?" recordings so memorable.  </P> <P> Instead, the quintet released "La Pistola y El Corazon," an album of Mexican  folk music. The album sold about 100,000 copies -- impressive for such a daring  venture, but negligible when compared to "La Bamba."  </P> <P> Louie Perez and David Hidalgo, the group's primary songwriters, now admit that  Los Lobos was, in some ways, buying time with the "La Pistola" album.  </P> <P> "The only sad part of the 'Moon' album (experience) was that it was  overshadowed by 'La Bamba,' " said Hidalgo, who also sings lead on most Los  Lobos tunes. He was sitting with Perez on the porch of Perez's old family house  in the Belvedere district of East Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "It was nice to see the crowds start getting bigger at the shows," Hidalgo  said, "but we would wonder sometimes why these people were in the theater. Was  it to see us or just because of the movie?"  </P> <P> The "Pistola" project, he said, was designed to salute the Mexican folk music  that the group played for years at weddings and dances in East L.A.  </P> <P> "The Neighborhood," which will figure prominently in the group's Oct. 19  concert at the Greek Theatre, features a few bluesy, high-spirited workouts  that should appeal to "La Bamba" fans, but mainly the album radiates with the  disarming artistic vision exhibited in "By the Light of the Moon."  </P> <P> Los Lobos -- which also consists of singer-guitarist Cesar Rosas, bassist  Conrad Lozano and saxophonist Steve Berlin -- began work on the new album in  late 1988, expecting to finish in time for release last January. But writing it  took longer than expected.  </P> <P> "It's not that we ever thought of trying to make 'La Bamba II,' " Perez said.  "That would have been ridiculous. But there's no doubt that during the course  of writing the songs for this album there was this thing looming over you . . .  the thought that you have to live up to the commercial success that we had with  'La Bamba.'  </P> <P> "I think we told ourselves a few times that maybe we shouldn't be as dark and  as introspective as 'Moon' . . . that maybe we should do something more  accessible," he said. "But every time we started going too far in that  direction, we found ourselves stopping and clearing the table . . . starting  all over, getting back to something that really meant something to us."  </P> <P> The four original members of Los Lobos (Berlin joined the group in the '80s)  were friends at Garfield High School, but were in separate rock bands until  getting together in the early '70s. Disillusioned by only being able to play  Top 40 hits at clubs and dances with their bands, the four friends began  exploring acoustic Mexican music in their off hours.  </P> <P> They enjoyed it so much -- and found such a positive reaction to it -- that  they switched styles, playing hundreds of weddings and dances between 1974 and  1980. Eventually, however, Los Lobos got caught up in the energy and  imagination that was being generated by bands on the Hollywood club circuit,  and the group shifted to rock.  </P> <P> Gradually, an undercurrent of social commentary began to surface and Los Lobos  stepped up to an entirely new creative level.  </P> <P> Images of the band members' old neighborhood surface in some of the songs on  the new album.  </P> <P> "We didn't set out to call the album 'The Neighborhood,' " Perez said. "It (the  title song) was one of the last songs we wrote for the album, and it seemed to  tie things together.  </P> <P> "It's a song about urban decay and drugs and everything . . . about the way  each person in a family is affected by the pressures of the inner city.  </P> <P> "You can't get away from the usual news routines of gang violence and drive-bys  and everything else, but there's no reason to lose hope," Perez said. "And  that's what we do in our music. We try to be constructive, give people some of  that hope."  </P> <P> Perez dug deeper into the band's philosophy and past.  </P> <P> "We had to make a decision a long time ago . . . whether to just be a good sock  hop band or something more," he said. "And I think the answer to that question  had a lot to do with where we came from . . . this neighborhood."  </P></p>

			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Tight security as thousands flock to the City THERE will be tight security at today's Lloyd's of London annual general meeting, the biggest event at the insurance market since an IRA bomb shook damaged neighbouring buildings in April. The bomb caused only slight damage at Lloyd's itself, but in its aftermath entry to the market's steel and glass headquarters has understandably become more time-consuming. Lloyd's claims that there should be room for any Name to attend the meeting as long as members bring with them appropriate membership and security passes. Seats, restricted to the ground floor and to the edges of the galleries of floors one, two and three will be at a premium although there is adequate standing room and TV monitors will relay proceedings to watchers from upper floors. In any event Names are advised to arrive early - at the building's main concourse reception in Lime Street for the meeting which begins at 10.30am. As for the procedings themselves, Mr David Coleridge, backed by members of the Lloyd's Council and leading executives at the corporation, will speak on the market's losses - a record Pounds 2bn in its most recent underwriting year 1989 - and prospects for Lloyd's. Formal business is limited to a presentation of the annual report and accounts of the Lloyd's Corporation and a vote of thanks. Little will be decided - the meeting's formal business is limited but Names are free to ask questions.</p>

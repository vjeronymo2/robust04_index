			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Carmakers offer EC prices table SIR LEON BRITTAN, EC competition commissioner, told the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders in London last night that manufacturers might be prepared to publish lists indicating prices of certain models and options in different national markets. Brussels and the producers have agreed that it would be both difficult and confusing to publish detailed lists covering all models and options. Sir Leon said manufacturers were also prepared to write to dealers urging them not to discriminate against buyers ordering cars for export to other EC countries. Brussels wrote to manufacturers in May urging them to make their pricing more transparent. But a consumer group claimed yesterday that Commission efforts to open up the car market were still not working. The consumer report, by the Bureau Europeen des Unions de Consommateurs (Beuc), says long-winded import procedures and unhelpful dealers continue to stop car buyers in some EC states taking advantage of low prices in others. It says the situation has not improved since 1989, and price differentials across Europe are in many cases still much wider than the 12 per cent recommended by the EC. The Commission and car manufacturers said yesterday they were moving towards agreement on how to make it easier for consumers to compare cross-border prices. The Association des Constructeurs Europeens d'Automobiles the EC manufacturers' federation, said yesterday: 'Beuc seems to suggest we are trying to avoid the issue and trying to hide information. We're not hiding anything.' The manufacturers have until 1995 to demonstrate that the 'selective distribution' system of exclusive car dealerships is not hampering the single market for car buyers. The Beuc study details wide differences in price across the Community, with Britain the most expensive country for car buyers and Denmark the cheapest. The organisation was also sharply critical of national authorities and dealers which, it said, hampered consumers' attempts to take advantage of price differences. VW may cut payout, Page 26</p>

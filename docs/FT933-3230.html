			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Delay to Cadbury measures agreed LEADING companies agreed with accounting standards setters yesterday on delaying the implementation of parts of the Cadbury code of corporate governance. Directors have been concerned about the level of disclosure which they will have to make under the code and said that they had been given insufficient time to respond to the guidelines. Sir Ron Dearing, chairman of the Financial Reporting Council, who called yesterday's meeting, was last night still trying to seek approval for a new timetable from Sir Adrian Cadbury, who chaired the committee on the financial aspects of corporate governance. Details of the agreement, which are expected to be issued in a statement by the council today, will suggest a new framework for companies when they report compliance with the most important aspects of the Cadbury code. These include provision of interim financial statements, commentaries on the state of internal controls, and on whether a company is a going concern or financially viable. Guidelines for companies on how to comment on such corporate governance issues in their annual reports are likely to be delayed until next year. Those at yesterday's meeting included representatives from the 100 Group of finance directors of leading quoted companies, the Accounting Standards Board, the Auditing Practices Board and the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. Sir Ron said yesterday that there would be regular co-ordination meetings between companies and standards setters. There would be agreement on timetables for the release of consultation documents, and on consultation and implementation per-iods. Quoted companies have been required by the Stock Exchange to provide a statement of compliance with the code in their annual reports for financial periods ending after June this year. Yesterday's meeting solidified proposals initially discussed in July after companies raised concerns that Cadbury and reporting requirements from other organisations were over-burdening them with excessive demands. The most public statements came from Mr Michael Lawrence, finance director of life insurance group The Prudential and chairman of the 100. His views reflected the discontent of a number of executives. Disagreements on the drafting of the Cadbury guidelines have caused delays to their launch, with the proposed statement on internal controls redrafted at least 17 times.</p>

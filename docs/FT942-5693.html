			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / Labour unveils industry policy Labour said yesterday that industry had reached a 'historic crossroads' as the party unveiled plans which it said would boost research and investment and encourage a long-term commitment to strategic businesses. The party said in a 17,000-word document, which attacked the 'short-termism' of the City and pledged the creation of a Business Development Bank to foster the growth of small companies, that it was determined to promote Britain as a 'high-skill, high-tech' economy. The opposition faced immediate charges from Mr Michael Heseltine, who last month launched the government's plans to boost industrial competitiveness, of old-fashioned interventionism which would destroy jobs and innovation. The document, launched by Mr Robin Cook, the shadow trade and industry secretary, sets out a list of policy commitments ranging from curbs on hostile takeovers to the abolition of the restrictions which prevent British Telecommunications from using its network to provide entertainment. Mr Cook said the document, Winning for Britain, was based on a year of intensive consultation with key figures in industry. In a sideswipe at UK financial institutions, he added: 'This document provides the policies that protect long-term investment from being put at risk by the short-term priorities of the City.' The proposals, which will be presented to this year's annual party conference, include a range of measures directed against current practices in the City. They include: Shifting the onus of proof in hostile takeovers to require predators to show a public interest. A review of regulatory rules in financial markets to support moves to more 'committed ownership', and talks with pension fund trustees on ways to ensure more investment in productive capacity. Possible changes to the tax treatment of share ownership to produce a bias in favour of long-term holdings. A review of the structure of corporate governance to strengthen the 'collective character' of industrial enterprise. More broadly, the document says Labour would institute a corporate tax review which would investigate the case for a tax credit to encourage research investment. A package of proposed measures for small businesses include: The introduction of a statutory right to interest on late payment by companies above a minimum threshold. A legal right giving a company in financial difficulty the option of a moratorium on debts for a limited period in order to develop a rescue package. The creation of the Business Development Bank and establishment of a network of regional development agencies.</p>

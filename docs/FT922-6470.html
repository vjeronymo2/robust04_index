			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Budget points enacted THE Finance Bill (number 2), enacting many of the proposals put forward in the Budget by Norman Lamont, was published this week. Most Budget measures have already gone through, either as a result of Treasury Orders or the pre-election Finance Act, which was given Royal Assent on March 16. That enacted the new 20 per cent income tax rate on the first Pounds 2,000 of taxable income. The new Bill deals with those measures which the government did not have time to pass through the Commons before the election. These measures include: Inheritance tax. Lamont raised the threshold to Pounds 147,000 from Pounds 140,000 on April 6, in line with inflation. However, he wanted to increase the tax benefits over and above inflation to Pounds 150,000. The Pounds 147,000 threshold took effect from April 6; provision for the remaining Pounds 3,000 increase is now included in the Bill. Lamont also proposed the exclusion of certain business assets and farmland from IHT. They include businesses owned by a sole trader, partnership shares and large minority shareholdings in unquoted trading companies. The measure will take retrospective effect from March 10 if the Bill passes through parliament. Married Couple's Allowance. This allowance, which has not been raised from its pre-Budget level of Pounds 1,720, is paid to the husband in the vast majority of circumstances. Lamont proposed that married couples should be allowed a choice in the manner in which it should be allocated. Wives can opt to have it paid in its entirety to them, or it can be split. If no action is taken, it will go to the husband. This is an uncontroversial clause and the Finance Bill sets out the arrangements with effect from April 6 1993. Gift Aid. Those wanting to give to charity under the Gift Aid scheme qualify for tax relief if a minimum of Pounds 600 is given. Lamont proposed reducing the minimum limit to Pounds 400 - a measure now registered in the Finance Bill and which should come into effect from July 1. Gifts would be treated as net of basic rate tax. A top rate taxpayer giving Pounds 400 could reclaim the 15 per cent difference (Pounds 79.99) between basic and top rates. The charity could claim tax relief at 25 per cent (Pounds 133.33). So, Gift Aid enables a top-rate taxpayer to give Pounds 533.33 to charity for a net outlay of Pounds 320.01. Business Expansion Scheme. The chancellor proposed ending tax relief under the BES with effect from the end of 1993. Under the BES, you could invest a maximum of Pounds 40,000 to receive a rebate of 40 per cent of the amount invested as long as this was maintained for five years.</p>

			<p><P> February 2, 1989, Thursday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> BUSH MAY APPROVE SALE OF TANKS TO ARAB COUNTRIES  </P> <P> President Bush has informed Congress that he may authorize the sale of 315  front-line Abrams tanks to Saudi Arabia and 200 to Kuwait while providing a  third Arab country, the United Arab Emirates, with 40 F-18 fighter jets,  sources said today.  </P> <P> Egypt, meanwhile, would get 150 Hawk missiles and Israel 200 shoulder-fired  Stingers, while Jordan again would receive no American weapons this year, said  the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.  </P> <P> The potential Arab purchases could touch off another row with Israel's  supporters in Congress, who were successful during the Carter and Reagan  administrations in blocking U.S. sales that were considered threatening to the  Jewish state.  </P> <P> But the skillful management of James A. Baker III, then the White House chief  of staff and now secretary of state, and other Reagan Administration operatives  overcame stubborn resistance to the sale of AWACs radar planes to Saudi Arabia  that the Senate approved 52 to 48.  </P> <P> The Abrams tank is considered the best in the world. Recently, U.S. and  Egyptian officials completed arrangements for co-production in Egypt with the  aim of providing the Egyptian army with them.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Leaks Discouraged  </P> <P> The weapons list sent to Congress is classified. Rep. Lee H. Hamilton (D-Ind.),  chairman of the House foreign affairs subcommittee that deals with the Middle  East, is understood to have cautioned other members of Congress and staff aides  not to leak any of the items.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the White House, in a cover letter, informed Congress that the  Saudis were in the process of deciding whether to request U.S. or European  fighter planes to replace their F-5s in the next decade, the sources said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir has reminded the members of  the United Malays National Organization, UMNO, and the people in  general of the danger of money politics and corruption to the  nation and the people. He said if money politics is accepted  within the party, corruption becomes a culture in UMNO and party  leaders are elected through bribery, the government will be led  by criminals and the corrupt.    The prime minister, who is the president of UMNO, was  opening  the party's special assembly in Kuala Lumpur. He said people  who regard corruption as part of the political and  administrative tools, only serve their own greed. Their  interest to become leaders is only for their own good and not  for the benefit of the people and the country. When the  government is corrupted, so are the government servants. This  will result in the whole government machinery being corrupted.    The prime minister said untiring efforts are required to  stamp out corruption before it becomes a part of the country's  culture. It will be beyond control once it becomes a culture.  The people will not get the protection of the law. They will  be victimized as they have no place to air their grievances.    Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir said in the party, a person who buys  votes will not be ashamed to sell his dignity when he becomes a  leader. His priority is not to struggle for the religion, the  nation, and the people, but self-interest. Such a leader has no  dignity and responsibility and is even willing to sell the  country and people.    The prime minister also spoke of the ill-effects of  corruption if it is not checked. He said a society which is  influenced by corruption will not achieve progress. Costs will  shoot up while all transactions will move at slow pace. It is  the people who will suffer.    UMNO members face penalties ranging from a warning to  expulsion if they are found guilty of abuse of power or  involvement in money politics under the proposed amendment to  the party constitution. UMNO deputy president Datuk Sri Anwar  Ibrahim, who tabled the motion for the amendment outlined the  actions that could be taken by the Supreme Council under a new  clause. Measures that could be taken include warning,  suspension of party privileges, disqualification from vying for  party posts, or contesting in general and state elections for a  term specified by the Supreme Council, and other punishments  being fixed and in accordance with the constitution. The motion  to amend the constitution involves the insertion of the new  clause 18.6 and three other new clauses and amendments to two  clauses aimed at combating abuse of power and money politics  which it was feared would destroy the party if left unchecked.</p>

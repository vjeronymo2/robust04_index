Our  reporter in Oslo, Ulla-Maria Johansen reports:    Fisheries Minister Jan Henry Olsen and Prime Minister Gro  Harlem Brundtland are satisfied with the negotiations' result,  which the fisheries minister regards as better in many respects  than the negotiations' result of 1972. According to Prime  Minister Brundtland, Norway has achieved a good agreement and  she recommends that Norway should now grasp the historic  opportunity and take part with its Nordic neighbors in the  political cooperation on our continent.    Anne Enger Lahnstein, chairman of the Center Party opposing  EU membership, is of a different view. One of the central  issues of the agreement is the Norwegian model of control over  the fish stocks, which is due to be transferred to the EU after  the transitional period as part of the EU's fishing policy.  Lahnstein thinks that the agreement is bad and it will turn the  sea region north of the 62d latitude into an EU sea. Norway  will not receive guarantees that after the transitional period  it will control the fish stocks in the Barents Sea.    The leader of the citizens' movement against the EU,  Christen  Nygaard, thinks that Norway surrendered during the talks. He  regards the fishing agreement as serious for the whole coast.    The leader of the European Movement favoring EU membership,  Inge Loenning, thinks for his part that the negotiated fishing  agreement is so good that he believes it will guarantee a  majority in favor of membership in the referendum.</p>

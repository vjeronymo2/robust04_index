			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>   [Text] Moscow, April 7 (ITAR-TASS) -- Under the headline  "To Achieve Civil Accord in Russia", the ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI  newspaper features the full draft of the appropriate agreement  (version 1) of last March 27.    The newspaper also singles out a decision by President Boris  Yeltsin on setting up Russian military bases in the countries of  the Commonwealth of Independent States as well as in Latvia to  ensure security of the Russian Federation and the above states  as well as to test new weapons and combat materiel.    Deputy Director of the Institute of Europe Sergey Karaganov,  D.Sc. (History), describes in an interview with the same  newspaper President Yeltsin's programme of a Spanish visit which  will start on April 11. It will be the first official visit by  a Russian president to Spain.    According to Karaganov, the forthcoming talks in Madrid "can  be described as a timely step of the two sides towards each  other against the background of the latest trend of West  European countries' certain aloofness from Russia".    This aloofness, he continues, was caused above all by  dissatisfaction of many European states with the solution of  their general domestic problems. The deputy director expresses  confidence that the visit will yield positive results for the  two countries in the political, economic and cultural spheres.    Under the title "Black Sea Fleet is a Political Notion Now",  the KRASNAYA ZVEZDA newspaper carries an interview with the  fleet commander, Admiral Eduard Baltin.    Noting that "Russia and Ukraine should equally appropriate  funds" for the needs of the Black Sea Fleet in compliance with  the Yalta agreement, the admiral states that "Russia has been  virtually fully maintaining the fleet since the end of 1993".    The admiral stresses that "the two sides should take into  account, above all, military need and economic expediency" while  shaping up their relations with regard to the Black Sea Fleet.  "In that case, relations will be good-neighbourly," Baltin adds.    The same newspaper runs a statement by Commander of Russian  Border Troops Andrey Nikolayev to ITAR-TASS which is entitled  "Russia will not put up with pillage". The newspaper writes  that the press reports all the time about violations of Russian  territorial waters by Japanese fishing vessels for illegal  fishing.    In this connection, a decision was taken to launch a special  operation on the eve of the fishing season to stop illegal  fishing by foreign ships in the Pacific region, starting from  April 20. It will be carried out gradually till next October.    Today's Moscow press singles out reports on the Komsomolets  nuclear-powered submarine which sank in the Norwegian Sea as a  result of a fire five years ago. It carried, apart from the  nucler reactor, two torpedoes with nuclear warheads.    The tragedy tolled 42 lives. In this connection, the  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA newspaper, taking into account that the  komsomolets was not decontaminated due to incompetence of people  responsible for this case, calls on Russian authorities to take  urgent measures to prevent a possible radiation disaster in the  region of the submarine's wreckage.    The same newspaper runs information that the upper chamber  of  the Russian parliament did not accept on Wednesday the  resignation of former Russian Prosecutor-General Aleksey  Kazannik.    Byacheslav Nikonov, chairman of the lower house subcommittee  on international security and arms control, examines in  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA a decision by Russian authorities to join  NATO's programme "partnership for peace".    He notes that the existence of the programme does not depend  on Russia's decisions. The programme will operate. "We could  influence its implementation by participating in the programme.    "by obstaining from the programme, Russia would lose every  chance to participate and will gain nothing, apart from  glamorous self- isolation from the rest of Europe," Nikonov  notes.    The TRUD newspaper describes "a veritable war against spring  elements of nature" and the emergency situations which have  developed in European Russia as well as in Siberia and the Far  East.    Over 200,000 hectares of land are now flooded, the newspaper  writes. "When do we learn lessons, at long last, from this war?"  the newspaper asks.</p>

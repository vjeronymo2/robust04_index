			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, June 14, RIA -- Ukraine is increasing the  number of the units of its national guards in the Crimea. Petr  Chernyatevich, the Crimean president's adviser for military  affairs, said this in his telephone conversation with a RIA  correspondent. As has become known just now, he said, the units  of the Ukrainian national guards have been deployed in  Yevpatoria and Kerch though this act contradicts the decrees by  Leonid Kravchuk of April 14 and 26, this year. According to  these decrees, the Ukrainian national guards should be deployed  only in Simferopol and Sevastopol.    According to the recent data, said the Crimean president's  adviser, the national guards regiment is being transformed into  a brigade.    Petr Chernyatevich asserts that the Ukrainian authorities  have not given up their attempts to split the Crimean interior  forces. They are conducting psychological pressure on them with  the aim of winning over at least part of the militia personnel  to their side.    The Crimean president's adviser said that this work is  headed  by Ukrainian Deputy Interior Minister Nedrigailo. However, the  local militia are still devoted to the legally elected Crimean  government.</p>

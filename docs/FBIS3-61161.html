Pragmatists submit to it  and pay up the set tribute, realists draw up their defenses, and  romantics wait for help from the state. Which of them are best  protected? Moscow today is like a postwar Moscow: people blow  up vehicles and apartments and cut down traffic inspectors and  detectives with bursts of rifle fire. But the militia is worse  equipped than the organized criminals, the engines of its  vehicles are less powerful, and everything is painfully  reminiscent of scenes in Govorukhin's unforgettable movie "The  Meeting Place Cannot Be Changed," in which brave officers of the  Moscow Criminal Investigation Department in a low-powered  militia bus chase after the bandits' powerful truck.    Moscow's modern militia does not appear heroic against the  background of this combat panorama. They know that they are  backed by a sickly city budget and that the future holds for  them the grim fate of being invalids if they are unlucky. You  cannot speak of strength of spirit.    But some obstinate people have come along who are prepared  to  change the situation. They have organized a public organization  -- "The Program of Social Protection for Professional Groups at  Increased Risk" -- with the task of giving social and technical  assistance to the Moscow Internal Affairs Main Administration  Regional Administration for Organized Crime [RAOC]. "Program"  was registered in May of this year and has already done some  things: the lives and health of all the personnel of the  service and its district departments have been insured for a sum  equivalent to $10,000 per employee; payments of 20,000 rubles  [R] are made for every underage child and R5,000 for medical  supplies for family members; office equipment and an imported  minibus have been handed over; and a two-room apartment has been  purchased for measures to be taken to protect witnesses and  victims. In addition, "Program" holds competitions in subunits  for the best in the profession and pays the winners R200,000  each. "Program" leader A.M. Kachur (a candidate of juridical  sciences and a former militia colonel) maintains that it is  capable of creating technical backup for the RAOC up to the  standards of the German police, if not better.    In the social and historical aspects "Program" is based on  the traditional Russian idea of self-management, whereby  society's efforts are directed toward resolving a particular  very important task. Kachur has persuaded a number of prominent  financiers and entrepreneurs to participate in "Program." His  reasoning was founded on a simple argument: They must have an  interest in winning the fight against organized crime, and it is  possible to achieve success by joining forces.    With "Program's" help the outflow of cadres from the RAOC  has  been entirely stopped in the space of six months. Kachur claims  that the RAOC is today in a position to protect anyone who asks  it for assistance.    Everything is splendid, you might think. Particularly as  Moscow Mayor Yu. Luzhkov approved and supported "Program's"  activity in his directive of 19 October this year, seeing that  it had provided an opportunity to improve the situation in the  capital.    But it has rightly been noted that Moscow is still not  Russia. As though confirming the tenacity of the Russian  tradition of officials' rejecting manifestations of  self-management, the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] Main  Administration for Organized Crime unexpectedly regards  "Program's" activity with great suspicion. Why? Many people  see this as professional envy, but they also do not rule out  more serious interests, which are now being attacked by the  Moscow regional administration.    There really is some mystery concealed in the Ministry's  rejection of "Program." We will not undertake to fathom it at  once, but maybe we will be able to unfold this MVD secret before  our readers in the very near future.</p>

			<p>SUMMARY                                 Iraqi media, evidently with an eye to future UN Security Council  reviews of the sanctions against Iraq, have avoided since mid-  March some of the most flagrant express ions that they had  previously used to convey Baghdad's nonrecognition of Kuwait.  Nevertheless, Iraqi officials and media have continued to express  hostility to Kuwait in other terms.                             END SUMMARY     Since 11 March, monitored Iraqi media have not been observed to  refer to Kuwait as "the 19th governorate" or to use other  expressions, such as calling the Kuwaiti Government "the rulers  imposed on Kuwait," that until then had appeared frequently in  the media, especially in the daily Babil, which is owned by  President Saddam Husayn's son 'Udayy.  The last monitored use of  such an expression occurred in a 10 March Babil article by  Saddam's press secretary 'Abd-al-Jabbar Muhsin, in which he  repeatedly referred to Kuwait as "Kazimah," the name Iraqis gave  to Kuwait City during the period of Iraqi occupation.     Nevertheless, Iraqi media have continued to indicate  nonrecognition of Kuwait and contempt and hostility toward its  leaders in other terms.     -- With one notable exception, Iraqi media have not been observed  to refer to the Kuwaiti Government as "the Government of Kuwait"  since August 1990.  Instead, they have been observed to refer to  the Kuwaiti amir and heir apparent nearly always without their  titles and by their first names only, and to treat "the Kuwaiti  rulers" with consistent disdain, in accordance with Saddam's  declaration that these rulers have "lost every legitimate right  to rule" (INA, 18 January).  The exception was a statement made  last month by National Assembly Speaker Sa'di Mahdi Salih, who  used the expression "the Government of Kuwait," but only in a  negative context of charging this government with failing to  convey Iraqi proposals to the Kuwaiti parliament (Iraqi News  Agency [INA], 16 April). (See Note 1)     (Note 1) In a transparent propaganda move, National Assembly  Speaker Sa'di Mahdi Salih said that the Iraqi National Assembly  is ready to discuss "all outstanding issues" with a delegation  from the Kuwaiti parliament and to convince it that the charges  that Iraq holds Kuwaiti nationals captured during the occupation  are 'exposed lies and fabrications."  Apparently seeking to drive  a wedge between the Kuwaiti Government and parliament, Salih  proposed that an Arab mediator conduct "shuttle tours" between  the Iraqi and Kuwaiti parliaments "so as not to allow the  government officials in Kuwait to drive things toward the worst,  as they did before 2 August 1990" (Iraqi News Agency [INA], 16  April).  The offer was roundly rejected by the speaker of  Kuwait's National Assembly (Kuwait radio, 19 April).     -- On 11 April, an article in the Ba'th Party daily Al-Thawrah  accused "the al-Sabah [the Kuwaiti ruling family surname] rulers"  of "squandering wealth, mortgaging sovereignty, and doing away  with security."  It castigated them for making military  agreements with an "enemy" [presumably the United States,  although Kuwait has also signed agreements with Russia, the  United Kingdom, and France], failing to "atone for their great  sins," and "being hostile to Iraq and buying other people's  hostility to Iraq."     -- On 21 April, an Al-Thawrah editorial characterized past and  present stands of "the Kuwaiti rulers" as "selfish, mean,  introverted, incomprehensible, and arrogant."  It urged "honest  men in Kuwait" to "confront the Kuwaiti rulers' suspect course"  because they allegedly "continue to be the ones who determine  when and how to provoke or permit the provocation of wars and  seditions and guarantee placing the region into the wolf's mouth,  as leader President Saddam Husayn said on 17 July 1990." (See  Note 2)     (Note 2) In a speech broadcast by Baghdad radio that day, Saddam  said that "the United States wants an increasing strategic  reserve . . . primarily to control the instigation of wars,  strife, and all that would put the wolf at the region's throat"     -- In the same context, as recently as 8 May, the Information  Ministry's English-language daily Baghdad Observer accused "the  Kuwaiti regime" of working together with the United States and  Saudi Arabia "to destabilize the security and political situation  in Yemen" (INA).     Dual Line     Illustrating Baghdad's equivocation on Kuwait's status, Iraqi  officials occasionally have made statements implying that Iraq no  longer claims Kuwait, but these have appeared only in foreign  interviews and press conferences, not in domestic media.  For  example:     -- According to a Jordanian paper, Iraqi Information Minister  Hamid Yusuf Hammadi said at a press conference in Yemen on 16  April that "Iraq has long dropped its claim to sovereignty over  Kuwait as the 19th governorate" (Al-Dustur, 17 April).  Monitored  Iraqi media merely quoted Hammadi as saying it was a "distortion  to link the sanctions to the issue of Kuwait" (INA, 16 April).     -- According to the text of an interview with an Austrian daily,  Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz said that "for the [Iraqi]  government, the Kuwait issue is finished," but insinuating that  the Iraqi people will continue to view Kuwait as part of Iraq, he  added, "one cannot stop people from thinking whatever they want  to think" and "one cannot erase historical facts" (Der Standard,  11-12 May).     Even when addressing foreign audiences, however, Iraqi leaders  have never recognized the UN demarcation of the Iraq-Kuwait  border.  Asked in an interview with Paris Radio Monte Carlo  whether Iraq will recognize the border with Kuwait if the embargo  is lifted, Speaker Salih said:  "Until 2 August 1990, we  considered Kuwait a state . . . .  When we accepted Resolution  660, I think that implicitly meant recognition.  But, if we are  asked, after all that happened to our people, to be lenient to  our people's enemies -- who insist on harming us -- of course,  this puts us in an embarrassing position" (25 March).     Background     Since the spring of 1991, the Iraqi regime has been maneuvering  between two incongruous positions, claiming on the one hand that  it is fulfilling the terms of the UN resolutions while, on the  other hand, condemning these resolutions as unfair and defending  as legitimate and proper the policy course that led it to invade  Kuwait.  Thus, in June 1991, Hammadi stated that Iraq's  acceptance of UN Security Council Resolution 686 -- which  requires Iraq to immediately rescind its annexation of Kuwait --  "has not changed" (INA, 3 June 1991).  Hammadi was seeking to  minimize the damage of a statement by Vice President Taha Yasin  Ramadan that it is "still our opinion" that Kuwait is "part of  Iraq" and that "if history repeats itself, we will still act in  the same way" (interview in Amman Sawt Al-Sha'b, 27 May 1991).     Baghdad has never accepted UN Security Council Resolution 833,  which requires it to recognize the UN-demarcated border between  Iraq and Kuwait.  In a letter to the UN secretary general on 21  May 1992, then Foreign Minister Ahmad Husayn laid the foundation  for Baghdad to contest the boundary at an opportune moment by  declaring that the UN demarcation deprived Iraq of its  "historical and geographical rights," harmed its "vital  interests," and was "imposed" on it by "force and political  blackmail" (INA, 1 June 1992).  He added that "the people of Iraq  will never accept" the demarcation and cited with approval claims  in non-Iraqi media that the demarcation decision is a "time bomb"  that contains "the seeds of another war."  Responding to demands  by UN Security Council members that Iraq announce its recognition  of the UN-demarcated border, Deputy Prime Minister 'Aziz  implicitly rejected Resolution 833 by stating in a letter to the  UN Security Council that only if the sanctions and the no-fly  zones are removed, will it be possible for Iraq to discuss its  border with Kuwait "in accordance with the rules regulating  relations among states as cited in the UN Charter and the Arab  League Charter," but obviously not in accordance with Resolution  833, which requires acceptance of the demarcation precisely to  avoid any further dispute (Baghdad radio, 17 March).     Implications  imply Iraqi nonrecognition of Kuwait is aimed at further eroding  international support for the sanctions.  Nevertheless, the  expression of hostility toward Kuwait in other ways, as well as  Iraq's failure to accept Resolution 833 and repeatedly voiced  claim that the issue of Kuwait has nothing to do with lifting  sanctions, suggest that the present Iraqi regime does not intend  to recognize the UN-demarcated Iraq-Kuwait boundary and hopes to  challenge it at an opportune moment.  Recent media treatment of  Kuwait also suggests that Iraq will not recognize the Kuwaiti  Government so long as it believes that its strategy to lift the  sanctions can succeed without such recognition.

			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / US delays trade action against China The US has delayed for two months trade action against China for its failure to enforce intellectual property rights and against Japan for discriminatory government procurement practices, writes Nancy Dunne in Washington. The postponement keeps the focus on China's human rights policies a month before President Clinton must decide whether to renew China's Most Favoured Nation trade status. It also gives Japan's new government time to address US complaints about barriers to US telecommunications and medical equipment companies when bidding on government contracts. Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, said some progress was made on Japan's procurement practices in talks at Marrakesh with Mr Tsutomu Hata, now premier, and the US 'will assess the seriousness of any official Japanese response'. On intellectual property rights China as well as Argentina and India 'pose the most significant problems in this area'.</p>

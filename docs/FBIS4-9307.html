			<p>BFN     [Text] Cajnice, Apr 24 (TANJUG) -- No shots were fired from  Serb positions around Gorazde since Sunday morning, even though  the Bosnian Serb command in the region has reported that the  Moslem side is obstinately trying to provoke return fire and  obtain an intervention of NATO war planes. The forces of the  Bosnian Serb republic (R.S.) on Sunday continued implementing  the agreement on Gorazde signed by R.S. president Radovan  Karadzic and UNPROFOR chief Yasushi Akashi on Friday in  Belgrade, Bosnian Serb military sources said.    The command of the Herzegovina Corps of the Bosnian Serb  army  has stated that artillery units have already withdrawn and that  when the U.N. forces are deployed along the demarcation lines  between Moslem and Serb forces, the infantry would also withdraw  to three km away from Gorazde, in line with the Akashi-Karadzic  agreement. Striving to fully contribute to the implementation  of the Belgrade agreement on Gorazde, the Bosnian Serbs have  agreed to the sending of another UNPROFOR unit to Gorazde and a  wide scale humanitarian mission in that area, the TANJUG  correspondent has learned from Bosnian Serb army souces.    An additional UNPROFOR batallion was to leave Sarajevo for  Gorazde at 1400 local time and the beginning of the evacuation  by air of the sick, the wounded and accompanying family members  when necessary was planned simultaneously. The UNPROFOR  helicopters which will shuttle from Sarajevo to Gorazde will  land every time in the Serb territory at Sokolac for Serb  control of the abidance by the agreement on evacuation, the  sources said.    On Sunday morning just as during the previous night, Moslem  forces in Gorazde itself intentionaly caused explosions trying  to imitate a Serb artillery attack in a bid to bring about NATO  air strikes. Sniper fire was also opened several times Sunday  on Serb positions, but without effect. However, as the first  U.N. convoy was entering Gorazde Saturday evening at Kopaci,  three km away from the town, the Moslems opened sniper fire on  Serb positions wounding one Serb combattant, under the very eyes  of French General Andre Soubirou. The general, who was watching  all this without reacting, just shrugged disinterestedly. The  NATO planes are frequently flying over the Gorazde front line on  Sunday in groups of ten, but at allowed altitude and without  attacking.    The Herzegovina Corps command pointed out that there is  reason to suspect that Moslem infantry would try to take  advantage of the withdrawal of the Serb forces to take the empty  space before the U.N. peacekeepers arrive. The Serb forces'  command has stated that in the past few days, the Moslems in  Gorazde massacred nearly 200 Serbs remaining in the town. A few  Serbs who managed to escape from the town at the last minute two  days ago reported on mass killing of Serbs in the town but could  not provide precise figures.    Many Serb refugees from Gorazde who watched Moslem  television  showing massacred bodies and claiming they were Moslems killed  by Serb artillery in Gorazde actually recognized Serb civilians  among the killed. Bosnian Serb Captain Boro Ivanovic said there  were nearly one thousand Serb civilians in Gorazde until a year  ago. After many murders committed by Moslems, only about 300  Serbs now remain in the town, he said.</p>

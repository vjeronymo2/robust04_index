			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLACING MORE MINORITIES IN ADS TURNS OUT TO BE HARD SALE  </P> <P> With famous actors like Bill Cosby, Pat Morita and Ricardo Montalban on  television pitching everything from brokerages to toothpaste, it seems that  minorities have become all the rage on Madison Avenue these days.  </P> <P> The ubiquitous Cosby is the most convincing pitchman on TV, according to  surveys conducted by Video Storyboard Tests, a New York-based research firm.  And one-time Chrysler pitchman Montalban, a Latino, and Morita, a  Japanese-American who starred in "Karate Kid" and now promotes Colgate  toothpaste, have also enjoyed wide visibility.  </P> <P> Such celebrities may make it appear that minorities are enjoying wider  acceptance in advertising. But a Screen Actors Guild survey suggests that the  drive to improve racial and ethnic diversity in advertising has stalled.  </P> <P> The report, published last fall, says that of the nearly 60,000 television  advertising roles in 1987, 11.93% were filled by minority actors, down from  12.28% in 1984.  </P> <P> While the percentage has increased 45% in feature films and television  programs, "ethnic performers may actually be slipping backward in TV ads," the  report said.  </P> <P> And it's not just the overall statistics that are frustrating to civil rights  groups, minority media executives and the actors themselves; it's also the  kinds of ads that offer roles for minorities.  </P> <P> Some kinds of companies, they say, particularly housing developers, Japanese  and West German car companies and firms selling so-called upscale products --  rarely use blacks, Latinos or even Asians to promote their products.  </P> <P> "I think the biggest need is to stop segmenting groups in our population" based  on stereotypes, added Elaine F. Brodey, who heads a Screen Actors Guild program  to utilize more minority actors in advertising. "Blacks can sell cars,  Hispanics do have credit cards, Asians do not always speak a foreign language  and Native Americans do not run around with feathers and a tomahawk in their  hands."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Disclaimer Required  </P> <P> The lack of minorities in housing ads, for instance, drew some attention  earlier this month when the NAACP and two other groups filed a lawsuit against  the New York Times. They charged the newspaper with publishing real estate ads  that almost always portray whites as potential buyers -- a violation of civil  rights laws.  </P> <P> Although the Washington Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights and the Open Housing  Center of New York are pursuing the case, the NAACP withdrew from the suit on  Jan. 13, noting that it had failed to follow its usual policy of consulting  beforehand with targets of lawsuits. The newspaper said the lawsuit was  "without merit," but the dispute mirrors similar complaints lodged against real  estate ads in other newspapers, including the Washington Post and the Los  Angeles Times.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Times now requires that real estate ads contain "a disclaimer  that says 'models used in this ad do not reflect any racial preference' " to  comply with federal equal housing opportunity laws, said Joan Heid, retail and  general display advertising manager in The Times' classified department. A  special logo depicting four ethnic groups -- Asian, Latino, black and white --  is also used in such ads, Heid said.  </P> <P> Advertising agencies say they take seriously the need to show racial and ethnic  diversity in the ads they create.  </P> <P> "We have a contractual obligation (with unions) as well as a moral obligation  to foster the use of minorities in advertising," said Dorothy Forget, a  spokeswoman for the American Assn. of Advertising Agencies in New York. "We are  very aware of our commitment. But I don't see that there's that far to go. I  don't think we are discriminating" against minorities.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Foreigners Preferred  </P> <P> Some ad executives also say the absence of minorities in advertising is not  always a product of racism and discrimination.  </P> <P> "I think clients have been made overly sensitive as to how and when to use  blacks because they are afraid of tokenism," said Lee Clow, president and  creative director of Chiat/Day, the largest advertising agency in Los Angeles  and the producer of scores of award-winning ads. "But I think the consumer is  getting pretty sophisticated. The color barrier is breaking down."  </P> <P> Shuji Okawa, a vice president at Hakuhodo America Advertising Inc., the Los  Angeles-based subsidiary of respected Japanese agency Hakuhodo, says that  because the Japanese are loathe to focus attention on themselves, they often  use famous foreigners in Japanese advertising -- from heavyweight boxing  champion Mike Tyson to actor Dustin Hoffman -- or no actors at all.  </P> <P> That philosophy extends even to the U.S., where Japanese beer maker Sapporo  shuns actors of any kind because it doesn't want them to detract from its  advertising message, Okawa said. By contrast, spots for Miller, Budweiser and  other American beers often use dozens of actors in barroom settings.  </P> <P> "The characteristic we want to emphasize is the quality of the (beer), not the  person," said Okawa, whose agency produces ads for Sapporo as well as ANA  Airlines, NEC Corp. and other Japanese companies.  </P> <P> Earl G. Graves Jr., Black Enterprise's vice president of advertising and son of  publisher Earl G. Graves, said the advertising climate has improved since his  father complained in an interview two years ago that Japanese consumer  electronics companies were reluctant to advertise in black-oriented magazines.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, the younger Graves said that, among some West German car makers  and Japanese companies, there is still "a prejudgment that if a product is  associated with blacks or minorities in general that it's not as good, not as  upscale. Our readers have a median household income of $51,000, according to  independent research. . . . But advertisers think the black market is an  all-inclusive market" of consumers with similar tastes and income.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Minority-Run Agencies  </P> <P> "We don't have any statistics (on advertising)," countered Michael Tsukamoto,  director of the Electronics Industry Assn. of Japan, a New York-based trade  group representing Japanese electronics companies. "But I don't think that we  have any discrimination against minorities. It's always up to the companies  which media to buy."  </P> <P> Thomas McGurn, a spokesman for BMW, said he's unsure whether BMW has used  minority actors because most BMW ads do not use live talent. However, a  commercial for the BMW 6 series luxury coupe that ran last year showed a  glamorous white couple in evening wear promoting the car. It was the sole  national spot for the car, McGurn said.  </P> <P> Such portrayals might be less commonplace if corporations hired minority-run  advertising agencies that might avoid racial stereotypes, critics contend.  Byron Lewis, chairman and chief executive of Uniworld Group Inc., a black-owned  agency based in New York, says major corporations rarely assign minority  agencies the responsibility of putting together an entire general market ad  campaign.  </P> <P> To change such attitudes, the Screen Actors Guild has begun showing advertisers  a 30-minute reel of commercials it says shows minorities in non-stereotypical  roles. A Citibank ad shows a black credit cardholder telephoning a Latino  customer service representative. A SAG spokesman said it is one of the few  financial services TV ads with an entire ethnic cast.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Procter &amp; Gamble Co., the nation's biggest advertiser, has  created a management position to coordinate ad placement with black-owned  media. The move came after the National Assn. of Black-Owned Broadcasters  claimed that P&amp;G spent only $2.5 million on advertising in black media  annually, compared to $20 million in Latino advertising.  </P></p>

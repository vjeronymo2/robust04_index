			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / Zeneca to buy US healthcare company Zeneca, the UK bioscience company, is to spend up to Dollars 485m (Pounds 310m) buying a US healthcare company. The deal is easily Zeneca's biggest since demerger from Imperial Chemical Industries in 1993. The target is Salick Healthcare, a Los Angeles-based operator of specialist cancer centres. Zeneca will take a 50 per cent stake by the end of the first quarter of 1995 and is likely to buy the rest of the company within four years. The deal commits Zeneca to a broadly based attack, through both drugs and hospital management, on the Dollars 1,000bn-a-year US healthcare industry along the lines pioneered by rivals such as Merck and SmithKline Beecham. Others, such as Glaxo Holdings, remain committed to concentrating on drug development. Mr David Barnes, Zeneca's chief executive, said the deal was part of a response to the rapidly changing US healthcare market. Zeneca has already started Stuart Disease Management Services, which specialises in managing patients with heart diseases in the US. The deal will dilute earnings by less than 2 per cent in the first year and be 'earnings accretive' in the third year, Mr Barnes said. Gearing, debt as a percentage of net assets, will increase from 'less than 10 per cent at the end of 1994 to low double digits', Mr Barnes said. For the year to August 31 1994, Salick Health Care had net assets of Dollars 102m and made pre-tax profits of Dollars 16.9m on sales of Dollars 131.5m. For each two shares held, Salick shareholders would receive: Dollars 37.75 in cash from Zeneca, worth Dollars 195m One share of a new special common stock to be issued. A payment to those shareholders from Salick of Dollars 1.25 per share, worth Dollars 5m. Holders of the special common stock have an option to sell to Zeneca after 2 1/2 years at Dollars 42 a share. Zeneca has the right to buy the outstanding shares at any time over the next four years. For the first 2 1/2 years, Zeneca would pay the market price subject to a floor of Dollars 42 and a ceiling of Dollars 50. After that the price is the market price. With options also to be bought, the total amount payable if the shares are bought at Dollars 50 would be Dollars 485m, said Zeneca. Salick shares rose Dollars 5.75 to Dollars 35.</p>

Marie Ruiz with the details:    [Begin Ruiz recording] President Ramos ordered government  bureaucrats to cut red tape to move the peace process faster,  following his decision to grant amnesty to all rebels and  insurgents.

The president directed Executive  Secretary Teofisto Guingona to make every bureaucrat move  faster. He also directed Guingona and Budget Secretary Salvador  Enriquez to solve the problem immediately. The president was  peeved by a complaint by former Ambassador Manuel Yan,  presidential adviser on the peace process, that although the  budget has been appropriated, there has been smothering in the  release of the funds.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast: Video report by Boris </F> Kostenko; footage attributed to "Tonis" TV Company and captioned  "Ukraine"]    [Text] [Kostenko] The problem of dismantling nuclear  submarines which have come to the end of their service life is  much more complex and dangerous than might appear at first  sight. Despite a government decision dated 31 August 1992,  funding of the construction in Nikolayev of a technical floating  dock for dismantling submarines has been suspended. And that  despite the fact that the facility is more than 60 percent  finished. Construction of two specialized docks for overhauling  nuclear reactors at Kherson shipyards has also been put on ice.    At present Russia has no docks where nuclear submarines can  be dismantled and nuclear reactors removed. More than 200  submarines are waiting in the North and the Far East. The spent  nuclear fuel has not even been removed yet from more than  one-third of them. Despite the fact that the reactors have been  shut down, they must be constantly cooled. An accident at a  submarine graveyard could produce another Chernobyl.    Some time ago construction of two of the urgently needed  docks was started at Ukrainian shipyards. One is 30 percent  ready, the other is already 65 percent ready. Contractors are  owed 12 billion rubles. And yet, up to 80 percent of the  appropriations set aside by the government is due to return to  Russia, to the self-same contractors.    Perhaps the necessary resources should now be made available  not from funds for disarmament purposes, but from funds set  aside for environmental protection. Otherwise expenditure may  have to be incurred to deal with an emergency situation, or even  a catastrophe.</p>

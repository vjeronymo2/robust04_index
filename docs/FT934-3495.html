			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Weak currency helps Australian miners A combination of a weaker Australian dollar, lower company tax and a small rise in exports boosted profits for the Australian mining industry in 1992-93 (to June 30), according to an industry survey, reports Reuter from Canberra. The Australian Mining Industry Council said net profits of the 120 companies that responded to its survey rose to ADollars 2.31bn (Pounds Pounds 1.03bn) in 1992-93 from ADollars 1.79bn in 1991-92. 'But despite this the rate of return on shareholders' funds was well below the average for the past decade and the prospects for future growth are dulled by continuing depressed world mineral prices,' Amic said. It noted that the industry's aggregate net profit was still below the ADollars 2.55bn earned in 1990-91. The survey showed that while the industry's operating revenue rose by 3 per cent, its operating profit before income tax rose by 7 per cent and net profit by 29 per cent, boosted by a 21 per cent fall in income tax. The substantial fall in income tax reflected cuts in the corporate tax rate, losses carried over and adjustments to earlier provisions, it said. Unit costs also declined. Overall, mine production rose by 2 per cent after a 1 per cent fall in the previous year, the survey showed. Smelting and refining production rose only 4 per cent and the generally low growth in industry output in the past three years contrasted with the strong growth recorded in the 1980s, Amic said. The weaker Australian dollar helped to offset lower world prices, resulting in a 3.6 per cent increase in average prices of Australia's mineral exports for the year. Amic said investment fell by 23 per cent in 1992-93 but added that some improvement in investment was expected next year, with net expenditure on fixed assets likely to increase by some 39 per cent. Uncertainty over the government's native title bill continued to cloud the outlook for the industry, Amic said, with exploration expenditure expected to rise by only 4 per cent in 1993-94.</p>

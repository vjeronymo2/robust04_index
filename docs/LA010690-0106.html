			<p><P> January 6, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DELTA FACES $70,000 FINE OVER 'UNAIRWORTHY' JET  </P> <P> The Federal Aviation Administration has proposed to fine Delta Air Lines  $70,000 for operating an "unairworthy" airliner with a rudder problem on a  flight from Fresno to Los Angeles about six months ago.  </P> <P> "Basically, what they did was fly the airplane -- a Boeing 727 -- with one of  its two rudder systems inoperative," said Fred Farrar, FAA spokesman in  Washington.  </P> <P> The plane took off from Fresno on June 17 with a Reno-bound flight plan and  landed safely in Los Angeles without incident. But, Farrar said, the pilot  failed to notify officials that Delta Flight 1575 had altered its plan and was  heading instead for Los Angeles -- leaving FAA officials guessing.  </P> <P> "We were looking at it as a possible hijack," Farrar said.  </P> <P> After investigating the circumstances, the FAA said it notified Atlanta-based  Delta of the proposed fine last month.  </P> <P> The agency also said it wants to revoke the operating certificates of the pilot  who flew the plane and the dispatcher who permitted the flight to continue. The  names of those involved were not disclosed.  </P> <P> Delta declined to elaborate on the FAA's action.  </P> <P> "It's premature to say anything at this time since we are in discussions with  the FAA," spokeswoman Jackie Pate said Friday. "It is a proposed penalty. It  could change as it is reviewed."  </P> <P> An FAA spokesman said the agency did not know how many passengers were on  Flight 1575 on the day of the incident. According to Farrar, even if the plane  were flying without passengers, the procedures followed by the flight crew  would have violated FAA regulations governing the safe operation of the  airliner.  </P> <P> He explained that the 727's rudder is in two sections -- top and bottom --  operated by separate hydraulic systems that provide backup if one section fails  in flight. Taking off in the plane with one rudder inoperative could be  hazardous, Farrar said, "because in a heavy crosswind it would be hard to  control the airplane.  </P> <P> "Secondly, if you had an engine failure on takeoff, you'd need all the rudder  you could get to control the asymmetrical thrust of one engine working and one  not working.  </P> <P> "It could have been different. If an engine had failed on takeoff, it might not  have ended so routinely," he said.  </P> <P> According to the FAA, the pilot discovered the plane's mechanical trouble  during taxiing just before takeoff and spent 20 to 30 minutes in an  unsuccessful effort to correct the problem. The crew apparently was in contact  with Delta's repair and dispatch facility in Atlanta.  </P> <P> "The captain and the dispatcher then devised a course of action to take off the  aircraft from Fresno with a flight plan . . . with no intent to fly to Reno but  instead on takeoff to immediately divert to Los Angeles because of the  mechanical discrepancy," the FAA said.  </P> <P> Farrar noted that Delta has repair facilities in Los Angeles but not in Reno.  He speculated that the apparent motive for changing the plane's destination  without notice was to fly the airliner to Los Angeles, where it could be  repaired.  </P> <P> If Delta can demonstrate that there were mitigating circumstances, the FAA  could reduce its proposed penalty, but, Farrar added, "we don't have to." He  said that if the airline refuses to accept the proposed penalty it can appeal  the fine to the National Transportation Safety Board.  </P></p>

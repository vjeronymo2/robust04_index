			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V. Kuznechikov, LESNAYA GAZETA correspondent: </F> "The Hryvnya Will Replace the Karbovanets"]    [Text] Printing of the hryvnya, the Ukrainian national  currency, has commenced in Kiev. President of Ukraine Leonid  Kravchuk, acting Prime Minister Yefim Zvyahilskyy, National Bank  chairman Viktor Yushchenko, and representatives of various  ministries and agencies attended the opening of the Kiev  money-printing plant. The hryvnya was issued, as the national  currency, in Kievan Rus as early as the 10th century; so, one  may say that it has been reissued in Kiev after quite a  considerable interval.    The Ukrainian president personally opened the ceremony which  started the technological line. "Only a country with its own  national currency can be truly independent. Otherwise it becomes  a branch of some other 'bank,'" the president said during the  ceremony.    It is rather obvious which "bank" Leonid Makarovich had in  mind. It is also obvious that nobody wants to attract Ukraine  into the ruble zone even with its new money instead of the old,  valueless coupons and its state of hyperinflation. So, even if  Ukraine becomes a branch of another bank, it is not going to be  the Russian one and no hryvnya will help there. Basically, we  are talking about replacing, under the conditions of the current  economic crisis, one piece of paper with another, even though it  has 20 levels of protection.</p>

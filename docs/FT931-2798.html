			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / King's Cross development in turmoil THE biggest inner-city redevelopment scheme in the UK has been thrown back on the drawing board after Tuesday's announcement that St Pancras is favoured as the London terminus of the Channel Tunnel Rail Link. The chancellor's announcement has undermined proposals for a Pounds 3bn, 5.25m sq ft office scheme, based on British Rail's proposed low-level terminus at King's Cross. At the very least, the plans will now have to be redrawn to take account of tracks that will cross the surface of the site rather than go underneath it. The developers are likely to try to salvage an amended scheme. They consider that it would be a waste of the time and effort already expended to abandon it completely. 'We are reviewing the position with Camden and British Rail,' said Mr Andrew Gay, chief executive of London Regeneration Consortium, a joint venture between NFC, the freight group, and Stanhope and Rosehaugh, a property company that is in receivership. However, Camden borough council, which gave qualified planning approval to the scheme last summer on condition that the railway development went ahead, is likely to insist that the scheme is fundamentally rethought. Mr Brian Woodrow, chair of Camden's planning committee, said: 'The original concept was a Canary Wharf type development which no one will finance. 'It is grossly out of scale with the area. There will be be considerable support for something more in scale and appropriate in the future.' Camden's reluctant approval was given in the first place on the grounds that high-value property development was necessary to justify the cost of building on top of railway lines; the development had to take place at the same time as the railway works; and the scheme would bring the community substantial benefits. These arguments have now been weakened by the change of plan on the rail terminus. The planning committee, which was due to meet last night, was expected to agree to postpone further work on LRC's planning application. The likely cancellation of the scheme was also welcomed by opponents of the scheme. 'There is now a possibility of a very different type of development,' said Mr Colin Macdonald, secretary of the Railway Lands Group, which favours a community-led, housing-based development. Many property experts are sceptical about the significance of the new planning obstacle to the scheme. The huge oversupply of London office space cast doubt over whether so much office space in a fringe location would ever be viable.</p>

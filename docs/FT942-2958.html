			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / Balsam's big derivative deals revealed Balsam, the German sports-flooring manufacturer which has filed for protection from creditors following the arrest of its entire board on fraud charges last week, has entered into currency options contracts worth DM10bn-DM14bn (Pounds 4bn-Pounds 5.6bn), it emerged yesterday. The sheer scale of transactions dwarfs Balsam's modest turnover of DM460m, highlighting the risks associated with trading in derivatives at a time of intense international debate over how such financial instruments should be regulated. Swaps, options and other more complicated products are known as derivatives because their value is 'derived' from more conventional assets. Bankers insisted yesterday that the losses they faced as a result of 'open positions' with Balsam were limited to a maximum of DM400m, a fraction of the gross value. But this comes on top of the DM1.60bn banks stand to lose as a result of the collapse of Balsam and of Procedo, Germany's largest factoring company, which has emerged as the biggest victim of the alleged fraud. The revelations raise the question of whether bankers should have become suspicious about the volume of derivatives business long before the company filed for protection. 'Banks have been remiss in assessing the relationship between the volume of derivatives business undertaken and the real needs of what was a relatively small company,' commented a banker at the Frankfurt arm of a US institution yesterday. 'They should have put a stop to it earlier on.' Separately, Citicorp, the largest foreign bank in Germany, confirmed yesterday that it stopped conducting options business with Balsam in the final three months of last year because the company 'no longer fitted our customer profile'. The case draws parallels with problems at Metallgesellschaft, one of Germany's largest companies which came to the brink of bankruptcy earlier this year after running up Dollars 1.4bn (Pounds 933m) of losses in the oil derivatives business. But bankers pointed out yesterday that, unlike Metallgesellschaft, Balsam was in general successful in its trading in derivatives - the state prosecutor in Bielefeld said last week that the profits from this area of business had for several years disguised losses in the company's mainstream sports-flooring activities. The directors of Balsam are accused of forging documentation to support applications for factoring agreements with Procedo, under which Procedo would advance cash to Balsam and assume responsibility for collecting the outstanding receivables. The cash advanced by Procedo to Balsam was used to finance the latter's currency options business. It is also alleged that the value of the receivables was fraudulently inflated. 'The case illustrates how little transparency there is in the case of over-the counter derivative products (products tailor-made for individual corporate clients),' said Mr Adolf Rosenstock, chief economist at the Industrial Bank of Japan in Frankfurt. 'It is a jungle out there.' The Bundesbank, which is be watching the development of the derivatives markets in Germany with a critical eye, refused to comment on the case yesterday. But Balsam's experience is likely to add weight to calls from the Bundesbank for a new listing of the risk facing banks which enter derivatives agreements with corporate customers.</p>

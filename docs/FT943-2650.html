			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / FT Expedition: Worn tracks Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker are trying to ski every day of 1994 on a round-the-world trip After 250 days (500 vertical miles) of skiing, the toll is beginning to tell  -on both skis and skins, if not the inner us. 'Your skis are just about blown out, mate,' says Alex Herbert at Fleet's ski repair shop in Thredbo, one of the leading resorts in the Australian Alps of southern New South Wales. Thankfully, a new pair of Salomons is winging its way towards me, courtesy of Snow + Rock and friends who are paying a flying visit to ski with us. They are also bearing all kinds of potions from Clarins to restore our faces, seared by the scorching NSW sun. At nearby Perisher Valley, they - like many resorts - keep a list of daft questions people ask. 'What time does the chairlift go?' is one. 'Will it snow at night or during the day?' is another. Perisher got its name when two cattlemen, trying to round up their herd before winter set in, rode into a blizzard. One of them wrote later: 'We rode out to the west face of the mountain to look down along the Snowy River to see if the cattle were there. 'The frozen snow was beating into our faces, Jim Spencer's beard was white with snow and turning to me he said: 'This is a perisher.'' In those days, snow was bad news; but now people sometimes travel for days just to see it. Dennis Bullen - originally from Barnet, London - drove for three days from Brisbane to reach Falls Creek in Victoria and enjoyed skiing in the rain so much that he is determined to return to Max and Rosemary Aitken's Feathertop Lodge next winter. Bullen's wife Margaret, who had never seen snow before, was less enthusiastic. 'The snow was wet and cold,' she said. 'I was hoping it would be a bit fluffier.' Max Aitken is another Englishman who only took up skiing once he had emigrated to Australia. He broke his leg playing rugby for Widnes, came to Australia to recuperate, married, and is now a part-time ski instructor. Driving long distances is not uncommon in Australia. One skier at the Barrakee Lodge, Perisher, knows two farmers from Nelson's Plains (a couple of buildings 18km north-west of Newcastle in NSW) who wanted to run-in their new car and drove to Perth, 3,000km away, for a hamburger. It took them four days.</p>

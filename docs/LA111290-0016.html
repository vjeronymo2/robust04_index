			<p><P> November 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLATFORM;  </P> <P> A TERRITORIAL ISSUE  </P> <P> Here in Los Angeles there is a lot of jealousy and infighting among people and  programs who have good ideas but keep them to themselves. It's a territorial  issue over who is going to get the best publicity in order to get funding.  </P> <P> Ten years ago, there was a broader funding base for social programs and more  federal money. Today, there is a lack of money and funding alternatives.  </P> <P> The bottom line is nobody is an expert (on gangs) because the problem keeps  changing so rapidly.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, one of the discouraging things we see now is law enforcement taking  on the (former) role of community-based programs to divert young men and women  from gang activity.  </P> <P> I'm glad they are trying to get involved. (But) we need to use the  community-based prevention programs already out there; otherwise, funding  sources may continue to dwindle as public agencies attempt to take over their  role.  </P></p>

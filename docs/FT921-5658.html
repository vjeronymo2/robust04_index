			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Asarco completes mine expansion ASARCO, one of the world's leading producers of non-ferrous metals, has completed a Dollars 224m (Pounds 128m) expansion of its Ray mine in Arizona ahead of schedule. The expansion raises Ray's annual copper output by 58 per cent, to 182,000 short tons (2000 lb). Asarco has also achieved its strategic goal of moving from being a custom copper smelter to become a fully integrated copper producer. The company will be self-sufficient in copper concentrates this year and even have a small excess, according to chairman Mr Richard Osborne. Asarco mines will produce 285,000 tons of copper in concentrates in 1992 and its smelters are scheduled to use about 262,000 tons. However, the excess will probably be needed at the company's Hayden smelter, which has been running at record rates since last August. In 1985 Asarco provided only 25 per cent of its concentrate requirements from its own resources. A 30,000-tonnes-a-day mill at Ray will be brought into full production in a few months.</p>

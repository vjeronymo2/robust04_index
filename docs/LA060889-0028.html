			<p><P> June 8, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: FIRST OFF . . .  </P> <P> Rob Lowe, who has remained silent since a suit was filed against him last month  charging that he seduced an Atlanta teen-ager into appearing in a videotaped  sex session with him, has filed court documents contending that the parents of  the girl tried to extort $500,000 from him. The documents, filed Tuesday in  Fulton County State Court by Lowe's lawyers, deny the allegations that Lowe,  while in Atlanta for the Democratic National Convention, enticed 16-year-old  Jan Parsons and claim that the girl's mother, Lena Arlene Wilson, used  extortionist tactics "by implicitly threatening him with adverse publicity."  The court papers said Wilson sought as much as $500,000 while the girl's  father, John C. Parsons, offered in March and April to ensure that no suit  would be filed -- in exchange for $500,000. An affidavit filed by Edgar A.  Neely III, Lowe's lead counsel, says Parsons and his attorney met with him in  May to discuss the possibility of Parsons' filing a criminal lawsuit in place  of Ms. Wilson's civil suit, and asked again for the money to prevent that from  happening.

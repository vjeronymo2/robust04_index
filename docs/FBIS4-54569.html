			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "su": "Slovak Television Council's Protest"] </F>   [Text] Bratislava--At an extraordinary news conference  yesterday, members of the Slovak Television Council made  available to reporters a statement that expresses disagreement  with the amendment to the Law on Slovak Television that is on  the agenda of today's plenary meeting of the National Council of  the Slovak Republic. In the opinion of the Council, "if  parliament approves the proposed change to the Law on Slovak  Television, it will mean the liquidation of the principles of  independence, nonpartisanship, and professionalism," the  statement says.    The amendment provides for the dissolution of the present  Slovak Television Council, which is based on the principle of  the civic spectrum of interests. Council members assess this  step as expedient, motivated by economic and preelection  considerations. Jergus Ferko emphasized the status of the  Council as the steering body of Slovak Television with  jurisdiction over not only programs but also the economic sphere  of managing television as a public corporation. He voiced the  fear that the structure of the future Council will be based on  the principle of the majority representation of political  parties, which would unequivocally politicize Slovak Television  and liquidate its independence. "If the principle is applied of  forming the Slovak Television Council on the party principle, it  will be a short-term expedient measure, which will lead to  permanent liquidations of the Slovak Television Council after  every change in the balance of forces in the parliament. It  would be a systemic step back, toward a situation that has been  overcome by developments, which will only raise political  tension and intensify the already serious problems of Slovak  Television inherited from the past," the statement goes on to  say.    The Council deplored that its members had not been invited  to  the work on drafting a new Law on Slovak Television and to the  relevant meeting of the National Council of the Slovak Republic  Education, Science, and Culture Committee. It called this  behind-the-scenes course of action illegal and unprecedented.</p>

			<p><P> July 1, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> A CIVIC IMMIGRATION SCAPEGOAT -- AGAIN  </P> <P> Isn't this beginning to sound familiar in Orange County? A city becomes  frustrated when its municipal services become overburdened. Then it reaches the  conclusion that illegal immigrants are becoming such a problem that it must  deputize itself to assume the task of stemming the tide.  </P> <P> It happened recently in Costa Mesa, where efforts by the City Council to enlist  local charities in the cause of immigration control brought confusion and  embarrassment to almost everyone from City Hall to Washington.  </P> <P> Recently, Santa Ana's own architects of foreign policy emerged with a report  urging local police to "gain control over the expanding illegal immigrant  population in the city" by working more closely with federal immigration  authorities.  </P> <P> From its title, you might think that the Mayor's Task Force on Neighborhood  Standards and Preservation, the group issuing the report, had as its goal the  protection of some local architectural and civic landmarks. But the 16-member  panel had a more jingoistic message for the City Council, to which it delivered  its findings. There were, it said, five key issues for the 1990s: neighborhood  overcrowding, the impact of the non-English-speaking immigrant population,  crime and gang activity, traffic congestion and the environment.  </P> <P> The report essentially laid these problems at the doorstep of illegal  immigration -- which in turn opened a hornet's nest of protest from the Latino  community and civil rights activists.  </P> <P> The report complained that schools are overcrowded and negatively affected by  illegal immigration. Its solution was a knee-jerk reaction, just as Costa  Mesa's was. It suggested that the Police Department increase cooperation with  the Immigration and Naturalization Service to enforce existing laws, and to  reduce the number of undocumented people settling in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> The director of a local Latino-rights group cut through the euphemisms to  outline the report's true message: "Conduct raids to reduce the number of  immigrants in Santa Ana." To his credit, Police Chief Paul M. Walters said that  his department already cooperates with the INS in arrests of illegal immigrants  who have committed crimes but that it will continue a policy of not cooperating  with INS agents on periodic neighborhood sweeps.  </P> <P> What's really wrong in the picture is that immigration problems have to be  controlled at the border, and cities should not be in the business of playing  U.S. immigration authorities.  </P></p>

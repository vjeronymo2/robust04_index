Participants in the meeting discussed the sociopolitical  situation in the Republic. The meeting adopted a plan for the  peaceful settlement of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict drawn  up by Democratic Congress members, which is seen as an  alternative to the Russian peace plan. In the near future the  plan will be passed to the Azerbaijani National Assembly for  consideration. In addition, the member parties of the  Democratic Congress issued a joint statement on the signing of  the Bishkek protocol by Azerbaijani parliament speaker Rasul  Guliyev on 8 May.</p>

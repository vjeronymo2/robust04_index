			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> RECALL OF COUNCILMAN IS SOUGHT  </P> <P> A group of Inglewood residents began a recall effort against Councilman Garland  Hardeman last week just six months after he took office.  </P> <P> The residents charged in their complaint that Hardeman is consistently late for  council meetings, does not respect council colleagues and staff, and has  "attempted through threats, intimidation and coercion to profit from his  position on the City Council."  </P> <P> Hardeman, who has a seven days to answer the complaint, labeled the effort  "name-calling and mudslinging" by political foes.  </P> <P> "I think the same individuals opposed to me being elected are now trying to get  at me another way," he said. "They couldn't defeat me, so now they're trying to  agitate me."  </P> <P> The notice of intent to recall was filed Wednesday at City Hall by Richard  Kaufman. The proponents were listed as Mamie Moore, Charles Moore, Viola  Grahame, Donald Robinson and Peggy Robinson.  </P> <P> There have been attempts in the past to recall councilmen in Inglewood but none  have been successful, said City Clerk Hermanita Harris.  </P></p>

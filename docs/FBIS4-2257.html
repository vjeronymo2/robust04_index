			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special Article" by Hong Fei (7703 7378)] </F>   [Text] Hong Kong, 28 Mar (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- The  "Regulations for Management Over Foreign-Funded Financial  Organizations" promulgated by Beijing in early March will come  into force on 1 April. Although the document is named  regulations for management, it is actually a signal of opening  up wider to the outside world. As a result, the regulations  have attracted attention in banking circles in Hong Kong,  Taiwan, Europe, and the United States, which are ready to apply  to open branches in mainland China.    More than 10 years ago, foreign-funded financial  organizations were allowed to set up representative offices or  branches in the four special economic zones [SEZ] of Shenzhen,  Zhuhai, Shantou, and Xiamen. In recent years, foreign-funded  banks have been allowed to set up offices in Shanghai,  Guangzhou, and other open cities along the coast. To meet the  needs of the increasing number of foreign-funded financial  organizations, the State Council promulgated the "Regulations  for Management Over Foreign-Funded Banks and Sino-Foreign-Funded  Banks in the SEZ's" on 2 April 1985, and the People's Bank of  China promulgated the "Regulations for Management Over  Foreign-Funded and Sino-Foreign-Funded Financial Organizations  in Shanghai" on 8 September 1990. However, the two regulations  were local documents and the provisions were too strict, which  evoked complaints from many foreign investors.    Compared with these two regulations, the unified national  regulations for foreign-funded financial organizations, which  will come into force on 1 April, are rather flexible. Figures  from Hong Kong's financial circles say that the new regulations  have increased the proportion of fixed assets of foreign-funded  banks and financial organizations from 25 percent of net capital  plus reserves to 40 percent. This move encourages  foreign-funded financial organizations to increase investment  and buy premises. Although the new regulations do not include  renminbi businesses in the scope of foreign-funded financial  organizations, some people say they are allowed to deal with  "approved businesses in the country's currency and other foreign  currencies." This shows that there is a possibility of Chinese  financial authorities lifting restrictions on foreign-funded  financial organizations dealing with renminbi business in a  limited way. A financial expert pointed out: The new  regulations turn convertible currency equivalent to the dollar  into convertible currency equivalent to the renminbi, which has  enhanced the status of the renminbi and has also paved the way  for the renminbi to officially become an internationally  circulated currency.    According to the new regulations, provisions for the  business  scope of foreign-funded banks and foreign-funded financial  organizations, include the following: Foreign exchange savings  and lending, foreign exchange acceptance, approved foreign  exchange investment, foreign exchange guarantees, foreign  exchange transactions, investigations and consultations, and  approved renminbi businesses and foreign currency trading.    As foreign-funded banks have increasingly asked for  permission to do renminbi business, Zhao Haikuan, director of  the Finance Research Office of the People's Bank of China, said  that foreign-funded banks will be allowed to deal with renminbi  business sooner or later, but the problem is that the conditions  are not ripe at present. The tax rate of Chinese banks on the  mainland reaches as high as 55 percent, while that of  foreign-funded banks is only 15 percent. As there is a wide gap  between the two, it benefits one side and it would be impossible  to introduce fair competition. Only when reform of the  mainland's banking system is completed and commercial banks are  established, which operate in the ways of a modern banking  system, will it be possible for foreign-funded banks to deal  with renminbi business and compete fairly with mainland banks.    To date, there are 98 foreign-funded banks with branches or  offices on the mainland. With the further deepening of China's  economic structural reform and opening up, an increasing number  of foreign-funded banks and financial organizations will set up  branches and representative offices in China. Citicorp recently  transferred its China headquarters from Hong Kong to Shanghai  and became the first foreign-funded bank to set up a  headquarters in China. J. P. Morgan, Swiss Bank Corporation,  and Credit Lyonnais and Banque Indosuez of France have gone to  Shanghai one after another to discuss setting up branches there.  More than 50 banks from countries and regions including Japan,  the United States, France, Germany, and Hong Kong have also held  talks respectively with the People's Bank of China Beijing  branch on the possibility of establishing a joint bank. Taiwan  financial consortia which intend to set up branches on the  mainland include Juntai, Tungtisi, Tungyee, Leeba, and Yuantung.  With the rapid development of China's economy and the  implementation of the new regulations, it is estimated that more  and more foreign-funded financial organizations will set up  branches or offices on the mainland.</p>

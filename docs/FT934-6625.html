			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Operators at BT ballot on action The 9,078 operators working in British Telecommunications' telephone exchanges begin a postal ballot today on whether to support industrial action against plans to reduce and withdraw allowances for night and weekend working, holidays and international work, Robert Taylor writes. Their union - the UCW - says they stand to lose up to Pounds 70 a week in pensionable allowances if BT goes ahead with its proposals from next April 1. 'The anger and resentment felt by operators needs to be reflected in an overwhelming vote in favour of industrial action,' said Mr Alan Johnson, the union's general secretary yesterday. Voting is due to close on December 15.</p>

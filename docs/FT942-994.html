			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Europe's most respected companies: Different keys to Eurovision theme songs - Peter Martin on national views What are the corporate qualities that Europe's business leaders most admire? The Financial Times/Price Waterhouse survey asked top managers to name the competitors they most respected on seven factors of business performance, and to list the qualities that contributed to this excellence. Their responses give a unique snapshot of the qualities important to business success in the 1990s. Each category has its own surprises. Companies best show they are focused upon their customers for example, by demonstrating that their customers are loyal. At least, that is so for British managers. Their response is enough to take customer loyalty to the top of the ranking on this issue, overall and in those industry sectors in which British companies are strongly represented. But managers from other countries placed less emphasis on customer loyalty: only in Sweden was the British view shared. Germany and Switzerland plumped for customer service, which was the top-ranked quality in nearly half the industry sectors; France and the Netherlands went for good communications with customers. Managers in Italy put good use of technology at the top of their list of qualities, a view shared by the electricity, media, oil and gas industries. There was less national polarisation on the second category: people. In France and the Netherlands, satisfied, loyal staff was most important; in Britain and Italy, this lagged behind giving people the means and facilities to deliver results. In Germany training was the most important people factor, a view shared by many industry sectors. But all respondents believed that progressive childcare policies and demonstrating 'real' equal opportunities mattered least. The answers in the third category, which asked for the company with the best products and services, produced one very surprising result. In almost every country, investing heavily in R&amp;D was seen as making little contribution to product excellence; quality also made little impact. The most important issue, in most countries, was meeting real market needs. In Britain, perhaps reflecting industry's traditionally concentrated structure, market leadership was seen as most important. This view was also shared in industries in which volume is critical (such as food processing and commercial banking). Despite the negative attitude to R&amp;D, technology was not ignored: making innovative use of technology was seen as the most important product issue in Germany and Switzerland, and it also scored well in Italy. Unanimity reigned on the factors contributing to outstanding business performance. In almost every country and industry sector, consistent growth and long-term profitability was the best definition of performance. More unexpected, was the general view that being a low-cost producer was not a particularly important contributor to outstanding business performance. Among industrial sectors, only cars and beverages put low costs as a high contributory factor to business performance. Perhaps Europe's top companies are more vulnerable to low-cost competition than they realise. There was also clear agreement on qualities that make the most important contribution to leadership: displaying a positive management style. Germany and the Netherlands, perhaps reflecting the way business works in these two countries, gave equal weight to communicating the company's aims and making sure they were shared by everyone from the top down. Taking a strong position on social issues came bottom, almost everywhere. What is the most important element in giving a company an effective strategy? As in the leadership category, clear policy and objectives came top in almost every country and industry; responding to the market needs of the 1990s came next. There was much emphasis on seizing opportunities in the emerging European market. But, perhaps worryingly, the rest of the world seemed less important. Only British managers seemed to care about doing business on several continents, though a handful of industries across national boundaries from insurance to engineering shared the view. Only in Italy (and in the oil and gas sector) were managers expected to have knowledge of international markets. There was little enthusiasm for the seventh category, in which managers were asked to nominate the company which cared most about the environment. However, a clear trend was evident: managers think of good environmental behaviour primarily in terms of production processes, not packaging or product design. Thus, investing in pollution control measures came top in most countries, while reflecting environmental policy in products, packaging and the like came bottom.</p>

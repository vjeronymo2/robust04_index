The demonstrators resisted against the suppression by combat  police with a fierce stone-pelting, shouting "We are dead set  against rice market opening".    They also protested against the police search into Chonnam  National University and Choson University at the end of  February, and strongly demanded that the puppet authorities  immediately stop the repressive moves to disorganise  Namchongnyon.    Prior to the demonstration, the students set the struggle  against the United States which forced rice market opening and  the struggle for resignation of the Kim Yong-sam puppet regime  as the orientation of this year's struggle.</p>

			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Leading Article: Slow steps to private coal THE GOVERNMENT will soon be able to judge how successful its first steps to privatise the coal industry have been. British Coal has received about 100 expressions of interest from private sector companies considering a use for four of the 20 mines it no longer wants. Unfortunately, it is likely that few will make firm proposals to reopen them as mines when the deadline for detailed entries ends next month. Since the government published its coal white paper in March, a response to the outcry which followed an earlier decision to close three-fifths of British Coal's capacity, market conditions have deteriorated. Tighter controls on emissions from power stations and an improvement in nuclear power efficiency have reinforced the electricity generators' determination to drive a hard bargain on coal purchases. This has spread economic uncertainty across most of the British coal industry, while at the same time reducing the attractions to private operators of discarded British Coal facilities. The four pits which by last week had attracted 100 expressions of interest were Easington, Cotgrave, Silverhill and Bolsover. Another 16 are being advertised. The paucity of ministerial action on coal since March suggests the government is indifferent as to whether the pits are taken on by the private sector or not. Ministers may think they cannot lose either way. If some pits are saved, they can argue that the privatisation process has begun. If no pits are taken on by private operators, they can say they were right all along; the market cannot sustain a large coal industry. Urgent task This inaction is justified with the explanation that nothing much can be done until privatisation legislation finds a place in the parliamentary timetable, probably in the next 12 months. But there are steps the government could, and should, take now. The most urgent task is to give clearer signals about the form of the subsidies which the government has already agreed in principle to pay for output from British Coal's 12 reprieved mines and from pits taken over from the corporation by private operators. The private sector cannot be expected to commit itself to deal in uneconomically priced coal on the basis of a vaguely worded promise. There is, admittedly, the difficulty that in defining the subsidy beforehand the government will give too much away, either to the producers or generators. But compromise will have to be found if the privatisation process is to begin. Competitive process A second point concerns the procedures for licensing out British Coal's unwanted pits. In its white paper the government promised to set up an independent coal authority to perform this role, and said the necessary legislation would be included in the privatisation bill. In the meantime, however, this task is being carried out by British Coal itself, and questions are naturally being asked about the corporation's impartiality in deciding whether pits should be handed over to rivals in a fiercely competitive market. So far British Coal has acted reasonably, but the competitive process has barely begun. The Department of Trade and Industry could instil greater confidence in the emerging coal market by appointing, on a temporary basis, an assessor who is not an employee of the corporation. The assessor could work at British Coal's offices and with its staff, but should be answerable directly to the DTI rather than to the corporation board. A third step the government could take would be to push through, before the full privatisation bill, the small but important changes which are needed in the law governing coal operations. For example, private operators may at present have no more than 150 people underground at any one pit. This puts them at an absurd disadvantage. Also, the government already has parliament's approval to lift limits on underground working hours which, by being unduly restrictive, have for years hampered efficiency at British Coal. For the sake of both the private and public sectors in coal, the government needs to move swiftly to introduce these reforms.</p>

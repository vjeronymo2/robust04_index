			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Stepan Sakhno: "Figure Out for Yourselves What </F> the Upcoming Elections Will Be Like"]    [Text] Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's victory in the Russian  elections--something which everybody is gradually becoming  accustomed to--has cast light on, among other obvious and  less-obvious factors, a phenomenon which is also timely for our  own upcoming elections. The essence of this phenomenon lies in  the fact that the average voter is far from understanding not  only the nuances, but even the concept of political life as a  whole; nor has he come to understand the purpose of the  elections themselves. Behind the endeavors of the candidates to  become deputies the average person has been unable to perceive  what this has to do with him as a citizen, a family man, or a  businessman (if, indeed, he has achieved this last-named  status). The voter has become alienated from the thought that he  will be choosing a leader for himself--a leader of the state in  which he will somehow have to go on living, raising his  children, and earning his daily bread. When and if the citizens'  nerves give out, they forget the following sacramental saying:  "Each nation gets the rulers it deserves." And, therefore, they  likewise forget their own responsibility for the choice that is  made.    The fact that this bond of "responsibility" is understood  and  even a common cliche for a certain politically engaged portion  of Ukrainians certainly does not mean that it is also obvious  for all other citizens. It is one thing to elect someone who  speaks eloquently or who has a very attractive appearance; but  it is quite another thing to take the trouble to analyze and  understand well which of the candidates would move the history  of our state in which direction. It is one thing to indulge  one's esthetic "ego" and make a game of filling out the election  ballot by casually running down the list of names with one's  finger; but it is something quite different to make a conscious  and well-informed choice--to show yourself to be a thinking  being and a citizen. This has become incomparably complicated,  of course, by the fact that nowadays the background of  philosophical thoughts is an exacerbated, impoverished society.  And within this society there is not yet any noticeable  educational-type, pre-election work for the purpose of informing  each persons about the importance of his individual choice,  or--for example--creating a unique methodology for making this  choice.    The first month of the election campaign is drawing to a  close, but it is only the politicians themselves who know this.  Television and radio are virtually silent about the upcoming  elections; they are waiting for advertisements to come in so  that they can sell air time. It is said that a certain  well-endowed businessman attempted to buy up virtually all the  air time of one non-state television channel. The channel in  question was not averse to doing so, but the businessman had a  foreign business; and so the channel did not sell him the air  time--at least, not all of it. But this situation is not  expected to last very long, and it is quite easy to foresee that  the candidates will very quickly be divided into the following  two camps: those who will have television air time solely within  the limits set by the state and those who will have it on an  unrestricted basis. Incidentally, baffled by the results of  their elections, the Russians have calculated that during the  election campaign Zhirinovskiy--the leader of the  Liberal-Democratic Party--utilized the services of Ostankino,  RTV [Russian TV], and Saint Petersburg TV more than any other  candidate. Those of our candidates who are not duplicating this  effort can--at least--be consoled by the fact that virtually  nobody watches UT [Ukrainian TV] in Ukraine. Well then, those  candidates who have the money will find us everywhere, and I am  sure that they will do just that.    However, let's turn our attention now to an amazing  phenomenon--the start of the election campaign passed  practically unnoticed. There was very little news and  information about this. Not primarily because of any feebleness  or weakness of the process, but because of the tacit taboo  imposed by the directors of the state mass media on mentioning  the principal deeds, offices, or names of the candidates. In  this connection, things have gotten to the point of such  absurdity whereby--for example--a well-known politician decided  to triumphantly comment on Clinton's arrival in Kiev; and this  could be allowed on the air, but if this very same politician  were to be the first one to officially register his candidacy in  Ukraine, this "shameful" fact could in no way be broadcast.  Thus, we might very soon arrive at such a situation as the  following: The airwaves will be filled with quotations--for  example--from the head of a certain party, but a timid silence  is to be maintained concerning the fact that he is a candidate  for the office of deputy. It is as if they were saying: Figure  it out for yourselves, and--at the same time--figure out what  the upcoming elections will be like....    In addition to such a semi-conspiratorial start, the  beginning of the election struggle was marked by quite a serious  scandal in the noble family of Rukh. Upon becoming a party,  Rukh--of course--acquired such a necessary feature as party  discipline, a discipline which was boasted about so  extraordinarily by the old Rukh staffers, as well as by the  romantic young ones. The obsolescence of such devoted fidelity  to party discipline was demonstrated quite recently by the  people's deputy, Serhiy Holovatyy, who is not merely a member of  Rukh, but also a member of the Rukh leadership. As we know, the  democratic-type parties have created and organized a unique  bloc--one whose basic task is to hopefully diminish the  competition among democratic deputies in any one election  district, and--ideally speaking--to support just one deputy with  all their joint, unified authority. And, in spite of the  above-mentioned "domestic agreement" and party discipline,  Serhiy Holovatyy undertook to register his own candidacy in  "someone else's" district. Such an action has quite seriously  undermined the reputation of Rukh discipline and engendered  doubts with regard to the monolithic nature of the party  benches. By way of punishing this "rebel," the democratic forces  decided upon the following, unprecedented step: to deprive this  member of the Rukh leadership of their support in the elections.</p>

			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / US car groups lobby Clinton The decision by Mr Federico Pena, US transport secretary, to push for the recall of all General Motors pick-up trucks with side-mounted fuel tanks could cause regulatory chaos in the industry, according to the big three US car makers. In an unusual joint letter to President Bill Clinton, General Motors, Ford and Chrysler said the decision 'threatens the entire automotive industry by creating needless, unreasonable regulatory confusion.' They said the move threw into doubt the value of complying with federally approved safety standards. Mr Pena said last month that he would push for a recall of the GM pick-ups, subject to the outcome of a public hearing in December. GM is seeking to waive the hearing, which would bring further bad publicity, in favour of taking the case straight to the courts. It continues to dispute claims that the vehicles are liable to burst into flames when involved in collisions from the side.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Edouard Balladur by </F> correspondent Ockrent -- live]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [Balladur] [Passage indistinct]  UN service to [word indistinct] maintain peace in Bosnia.  Unfortunately, this is no longer what the UN mission is about,  but to keep the civilian populations from suffering too much,  and to facilitate humanitarian aid. What one can see is that  there is doublespeak in a way, and that the warring factions,  whether Serbs, Croats, or even Muslims, all three behave the  same way. They talk about peace and agreements when they are in  Geneva, and when they are in Bosnia -- and I do not know whether  they are the same ones, because I do not really know how they  are organized -- they jeopardize the transport of humanitarian  aid and the safety of UN soldiers.    I believe that the time has come to put the following  question to them: What is happening, and when do you say what  you really believe -- when you are in Geneva, where you discuss  with the UN and EU representatives, or when you are on the  ground, where you jeopardize the safety of UN soldiers,  including the French soldiers who are the most numerous and who  defend civilians?    [Ockrent] Could this question be put formally at the next  NATO summit, which is due to take place in Brussels next Monday  and Tuesday [10-11 January]?    [Balladur] As far as I know, it is not on the agenda, but I  would be surprised if the question was not raised. [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / International Company News: NAB reaffirms search for US acquisition National Australia Bank (NAB), the largest and strongest of the Australian banks and the owner of various regional banks in the UK and Ireland, said yesterday it was still looking for an acquisition in the US. Mr Bill Irvine, the chairman, also told shareholders at yesterday's annual meeting that the bank was not as strong as it wanted to be in the south of England and in the Republic of Ireland. Acquisitions in these areas, along with the US, would take precedence over any purchases in Australia, he said. Speculation that NAB would seek to acquire a US banking business has been rife for some time. Unlike some of its rivals, who are still retrenching, the bank has weathered the recession in fairly good shape, and can afford to look to new markets. However, several analysts have questioned whether NAB's enthusiasm for a US deal might have faded in the face of the recent consolidation within the banking sector there. This has arguably removed some of the most attractive acquisition candidates from the field. NAB, which owns the Clydesdale, Yorkshire, Northern and National Irish banks, also said the current year had started well, and that it expected to 'record a further satisfactory improvement in results over the current year'. In 1992-93, NAB's profit after tax but before abnormal items, rose by a third, to ADollars 1.07bn (USDollars 746m).</p>

			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> REPORT DETAILING SAN ONOFRE PLANT FAILINGS SITS IDLE  </P> <P> One year after a 15-year, $46-million study found that the San Onofre Nuclear  Generating Station is breaking federal law by killing off tons of fish and  kelp, state regulatory agencies have taken no action on the findings, and  environmentalists -- including one of the study's three authors -- are crying  foul.  </P> <P> "Somewhere along the line, justice is being delayed," said Rimmon C. Fay, a  biologist who represented environmentalists' interests on the three-member  Marine Review Committee, which released its study a year ago this week. "The  present composition of the Coastal Commission is not one of great dedication  toward the environment. The (state Regional Water Quality Control Board) has an  outstanding record of neglect of enforcement of regulation. So nothing is being  done."  </P> <P> Richard (Corky) Wharton, an environmental lawyer who unsuccessfully challenged  the nuclear plant's license a decade ago, agreed.  </P> <P> "It's been one year and they have done absolutely nothing but set the hearings  back again and again," said Wharton, now a professor at San Diego School of  Law. "Nobody questions (that the study is) the most definitive report of its  kind ever done. But there it is, and there it sits."  </P> <P> The study, which was ordered by the California Coastal Commission, found that  the nuclear plant had caused a 60%, or 200-acre, reduction in the area covered  by the San Onofre kelp bed. It found that the plant's cooling system sucks up  and kills 21 to 57 tons of fish yearly, then discharges the debris-filled water  into the ocean, reducing natural light levels on the ocean floor by as much as  16%.  </P> <P> These "substantial" adverse effects -- while "not large-scale ecological  disasters" -- violate the plant's federal pollutant-discharge permit, the study  found. It recommended several ways to prevent or mitigate the damage, from  upgrading the plant's cooling system to building an artificial reef.  </P> <P> To date, the plant's operator, Southern California Edison, has not altered its  operations, Edison officials confirmed. And spokesmen for the two state  agencies that have the authority to force Edison to take action on the study's  recommendations acknowledge that they have been slow to evaluate them,  repeatedly postponing hearings in order to focus on other pressing issues. But  they say overwork -- not oversight -- is to blame for the delay.  </P> <P> "The truth of the matter is we haven't had staff to do it -- we should have a  team of 10 scientists looking at this and we don't. We didn't have anybody  working on it for a while," said Susan M. Hansch, manager of the energy and  ocean resources unit of the Coastal Commission. "The commission is definitely  not dragging their feet. It's the staff -- we haven't taken it to them. We  couldn't."  </P> <P> The Coastal Commission created the Marine Review Committee in 1974 as a  condition of its granting Edison a construction permit to expand from one  reactor to three. The committee's study, which was completely financed by  Edison, was intended to provide an independent scientific review of the plant's  impact by appointing one biologist for each special interest: Edison, the  environmentalists and the Coastal Commission.  </P> <P> Hansch said the commission is due to take up the study when it meets in San  Diego in December. But that has led to the third postponement of a Water  Quality Control Board hearing on the study; although the board is not required  to by law, it has decided to wait for the Coastal Commission to evaluate the  study.  </P> <P> "Our feeling was the Coastal Commission initiated the study and completed the  study and they should take a position on it," said John V. Foley, a board  member and the general manager of the the Moulton Niguel Water District, which  serves southern Orange County. "The real question is does the study really,  truly document any violations. I don't think we want to do their work first.  And we don't have a reason to believe anything yet."  </P> <P> What that has meant, however, is that every time the Coastal Commission  postpones action, so does the water board. Last December, two of Wharton's law  students asked the board to revoke the plant's permit until Edison remedies the  two reported permit violations. The board delayed taking action until April,  then delayed it until August, and now has said it will wait until sometime in  January.  </P> <P> "It's kind of a joke; we've had so many tentative dates scheduled and they've  all been postponed," said Bruce Posthumus, a senior water resource control  engineer for the board, adding that the board's tentative January hearing is  designed to follow the Coastal Commission's December meeting. "That's a ways  away. Between now and then, who knows what will happen? I wouldn't bet against  it being postponed again."  </P> <P> Edison spokesmen called the postponement "reasonable," but rejected their  critics' contention that the company has exerted its influence to extend the  delays.  </P> <P> "I don't think this could be laid at our doorstep," said Michael Hertel,  Edison's manager of environmental affairs. "It took (Fay) and his colleagues 13  or 14 years to come up with the report, and it's obviously going to take the  Coastal Commission some time to decide what should be done. To take a little  bit of extra time on it to make sure they do the right thing is not only the  prerogative but the duty of the commission."  </P> <P> In the meantime, environmentalists say, the San Onofre kelp bed will pay the  price.  </P> <P> "As long as that plant operates in its present mode, on a cumulative basis  things are going to grow worse," said Fay, who believes that even the final  report to which he signed his name underestimates the extent of the damage. In  order to get construction permits in 1974, Fay said, Edison "said, in effect,  'If you provide us the evidence that something is wrong, we will do something  about it.' But nothing has happened. Nothing. Not even token action. It is  frustrating."  </P></p>

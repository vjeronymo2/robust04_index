			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD OF VIOLENCE IMPERILS FUTURE OF BORDER CRIME UNIT  </P> <P> Five years ago, the San Diego Police Department and the U.S. Border Patrol  launched a joint initiative unique in the United States, the Border Crime  Prevention Unit, a nighttime foot patrol designed to deter robberies and  assaults against the hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants who enter  the United States from Tijuana each year.  </P> <P> The new anti-crime squad, authorities vowed, would be safer than its swaggering  predecessor, an undercover outfit of San Diego policemen whose exploits in and  out of the hazardous border canyons from 1976 through 1978 were chronicled in  Joseph Wambaugh's book, "Lines and Shadows."  </P> <P> The new unit was to be a high-profile uniformed force that would eschew the  provocative tactics of the former plainclothes squad that tried to lure robbers  by dressing and behaving as undocumented border crossers.  </P> <P> "We were looking for a shoot-out every night," said San Diego Police Chief Bob  Burgreen, a deputy chief when the decision was made to disband the old squad.  </P> <P> But the current squad, despite uniforms and intent, has amassed a much more  violent record than its predecessor.  </P> <P> And in the wake of a particularly bloody period -- during a recent two-week  stretch, unit members shot and killed four robbery suspects -- some critics  have called for the patrol to be dissolved.  </P> <P> In every fatal shooting incident involving the unit, authorities say, the  suspects attempted to assault the officers, apparently mistaking them in the  darkness for undocumented border crossers whom they intended to rob. In most  cases, according to authorities, officers opened fire before they had an  opportunity to identify themselves as lawmen.  </P> <P> In five years, the dozen or so lawmen assigned to the unit at a given time have  shot 44 suspects, 18 of whom have died -- a fatal shooting total greater than  that of the 1,700-member San Diego Police Department during the same period.  The previous squad killed two suspects during its 18 months of operation.  </P> <P> Most suspects arrested by the squad are caught after attempting to assault the  officers, not for attacking other aliens. Of the 48 people arrested last year,  "almost all of them were arrested for trying to rob the border unit," Burgreen  said.  </P> <P> "I think it's an open question as to who's commiting the most crime -- law  enforcement or the bandits," said Roberto Martinez, a longtime activist who  works for the American Friends Service Committee, the social action arm of the  Quaker church.  </P> <P> Burgreen and other top law enforcement officials remain solidly in favor of the  unit's work in the border area, which is within San Diego city limits, and say  it will continue its dangerous mission. "Morally," Burgreen said, "there's no  question that we're doing the right thing."  </P> <P> Robert Gilson, assistant chief Border Patrol agent, added, "From the  humanitarian point of view, we have to do it."  </P> <P> Police and Border Patrol officials insist that the uniformed outfit's operation  is significantly different from the earlier squad's.  </P> <P> "The question is, were we (previously) asking to get into shoot-outs rather  than prevent them?" Burgreen said during a recent interview. "What we're trying  to do now is to prevent them and send those casual bandits packing back to  Mexico. . . . And the only ones that remain are those extremely brazen bandits  who don't even check to see that they're robbing a cop. . . . I can honestly  say we're not putting decoys out there."  </P> <P> Authorities say the current squad shoots more suspects than its predecessor for  a logical reason: With Mexico's economy in a shambles, more people are crossing  the border now than were doing so a decade ago. Consequently, there are more  robbers lurking in the canyons.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Uniforms Blamed  </P> <P> Manny Lopez, the former San Diego police sergeant who supervised the  plainclothes unit, contends that the current squad's uniformed status may have  unwittingly triggered more violence. Robbers and officers may open fire more  quickly, he maintains, as the stakes are clearly much higher.  </P> <P> "When you're undercover, you have that extra second of hesitation; the bandit  doesn't know who you are or that you're armed. It gives you an advantage," said  Lopez, now a private investigator in San Diego. "I know this: I wouldn't go out  there in uniform. No way."  </P> <P> The dozens of regular uniformed Border Patrol agents who also man the canyons  each evening are not attacked nearly as often as the special unit's members.  The reason, said Border Patrol assistant chief Gilson, is that regular Border  Patrol agents stay close to their vehicles, even when on foot, and are  therefore more easily identifiable as law enforcement officers.  </P> <P> No special unit member has been shot since May, 1985, when Border Patrol Agent  Fred Stevens took five bullets. He survived, probably because he was wearing a  bullet-proof vest. Three Border Patrol agents have been shot during the current  unit's five-year history; all three recovered. During the 18-month operation of  the previous outfit, three officers were also shot, but never by robbers: Two  were shot by other unit members, the third by a Tijuana policeman.  </P> <P> </P> <P> FBI Investigation  </P> <P> In the most recent shooting, on Jan. 4, the Federal Bureau of Investigation has  begun a preliminary inquiry into allegations that two suspects were shot and  killed while handcuffed and fleeing back to Mexico. Police say the men were  shot when they attempted to assault the lawmen.  </P> <P> The allegations prompted the Mexican Embassy in Washington to send a note to  the State Department questioning the "disproportionate" use of force -- the  dead men were armed with screwdrivers and knives, the officers with  semi-automatic pistols and a shotgun.  </P> <P> A survivor of the Jan. 4 shooting, like a number of others who have recovered  from such confrontations, has maintained that he was a smuggler shot without  provocation by patrol officers, who he initially assumed were Central American  migrants.  </P> <P> The San Diego County district attorney's office, which reviews law enforcement  shootings, has ruled that the officers were justified in using deadly force in  each of the fatal shootings involving the unit. The most recent two cases,  involving four deaths, are pending.  </P> <P> The squad has been largely inactive since Jan. 4 -- officials say they have  been reviewing procedures since the latest shooting -- but the officers are  expected to be redeployed within a few weeks.  </P> <P> Critics object to the unit's return, maintaining that the many uniformed Border  Patrol officers deployed at the border should be sufficient deterrent to crime.  "If these were white Americans getting shot, there wouldn't be any question of  pulling the unit out," said Martinez, the rights advocate. "There would have  been an outcry a long time ago."  </P> <P> The eight or so miles of border separating San Diego and Tijuana is a unique  strip along the 1,900-mile U.S.-Mexico border. Nowhere else do so many people  attempt to enter the United States through such rugged terrain.  </P> <P> It is the single largest gateway for the job markets of California and  elsewhere in the United States. Each evening, hundreds, sometimes thousands, of  border crossers mass just inside U.S. territory, awaiting the cover of darkness  to attempt entry beyond the narrow border strip.  </P> <P> With so much traffic, a very specialized economy has evolved in the rugged belt  of U.S. territory. At principal staging areas, vendors hawk food and clothing.  Marijuana and liquor are widely available. Smugglers flaunt their services.  </P> <P> Enterprising thieves seek easy pickings from the border crossers, many of whom  carry their life savings. The migrants are universally referred to as pollos  (chickens).  </P> <P> Statistics regarding border violence are inconclusive. Everyone agrees that the  majority of crimes -- robberies, rapes, assaults -- go unreported, as  undocumented people are hesitant to run to authorities. Only 40 robberies were  reported in the border strip during 1988, police said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fewer Robberies  </P> <P> The number of reported robberies has, in fact, declined since 1986, when 170  were recorded. Authorities cite the decline as an indication of the unit's  effectiveness. The decrease also corresponds with what U.S. officials say is a  sharp drop in the number of illegal border crossers since the passage of  revised immigration laws.  </P> <P> The only reliable crime figure from the canyons, Burgreen suggests, is for  murder. Homicide figures from the canyons have fluctuated without any  discernable pattern since 1984, however, when the current unit was first  deployed. There was one murder in 1984 and nine in 1985. There were six murders  in 1986, two in 1987 and five in 1988.  </P> <P> Unit officers killed six suspects in 1988, the highest number in the unit's  history.  </P> <P> Authorities believe the unit's presence has reduced the threat.  </P> <P> "I'm convinced, no question, that we are deterring violence in the canyons, and  we're keeping innocent people from being victimized and murdered," Burgreen  said. "If we weren't in the canyons patroling, I shudder to think how many  (victims) we would have found."  </P></p>

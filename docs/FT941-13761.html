			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / Rowland allies near agreement to resign from Lonrho board Four of Mr Tiny Rowland's closest supporters on the board of Lonrho are near to agreeing to resign from the company in return for payments equivalent to two years' salary. The move would leave Mr Dieter Bock, joint chief executive of Lonrho with Mr Rowland, in control of the international conglomerate. Since joining Lonrho a year ago, Mr Bock has been battling with Mr Rowland to transform the trading group into a more orthodox company. The resignation deal may be announced on Tuesday together with the group's annual results. Shareholders' approval for the payments will probably be sought as the four directors are on one-year contracts - any compensation arrangements above the contractual obligation must be put to a shareholders' vote. The directors discussing the terms for early departure are Mr Rene Leclezio, chairman, and Sir Peter Youens, both in their 70s, and the two deputy chairmen, Mr Paul Spicer and Mr Robert Dunlop, who are in their mid-60s. Last year, Mr Bock succeeded in appointing non-executives to the Lonrho board for the first time in 20 years. His priority for months has been to arrange the resignations of a few directors closely linked to Mr Rowland. Severance pay for the four, which could be around Pounds 500,000 each for Mr Spicer and Mr Leclezio, has to be generous since Lonrho's articles of association make the departure of any director conditional on that director's consent. Directors can only be removed with the unanimous approval of the board. However, some Lonrho shareholders are likely to be reluctant to agree to such generous departure terms. Rather than risk a public dispute over the payments, Mr Bock had originally considered paying the four their contractual entitlements and then a further amount, described as consultancy payments, equivalent to an extra 12 months' salary. That would have avoided a shareholder vote. However, Mr Bock is keen that the company should be seen to be following the Cadbury Committee's code on corporate governance and felt that avoiding a shareholder vote would not be within the spirit of the code. At the group's annual meeting in March, shareholders will be asked to vote in favour of changes to the group's articles of association which would allow directors to be removed by a simple majority and the introduction of a retirement age of 65. Mr Rowland, who is 76, would be exempt from this rule.</p>

			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / 11 Downing Street to get security facelift Safety conscious: the windows of No 11 Downing Street, the chancellor's home, are replaced as part of alterations to improve security. The work was suggested by security officials after last year's IRA mortar attack, which caused slight damage to the back of No 10, which is undergoing similar changes.</p>

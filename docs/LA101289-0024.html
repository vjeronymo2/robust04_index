			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHAVEZ AND FARM WORKERS UNION  </P> <P> Jones' ignorance about "La Causa" is no less apparent than it must have been  when, as he alleges, he walked into the farm workers headquarters in 1968.  </P> <P> To dismiss Deukmejian's role in the dismantling of the Agricultural Labor  Relations Board and the resultant freeze on successful organizing campaigns by  the UFW as "hogwash" is hogwash indeed.  </P> <P> And Jones' characterization of Chavez as a vandal is the ultimate insult -- not  only to the man but to everything he stands for.  </P> <P> To dignify this quisling's article by placing it on Page 3 (rather than the  Opinion section where it would still be crude) clearly demonstrates The Times'  anti-union animus.  </P> <P> T. SANTORA  </P> <P> President, Local 9574  </P> <P> Communications Workers  </P> <P> of America, Los Angeles  </P></p>

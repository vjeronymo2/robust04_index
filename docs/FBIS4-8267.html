			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, April 11 (CTK) -- The Executive Council of  the Civic Democratic Party (ODS) is not pleased that the bill on  the competences of higher local administrative units has not yet  been put before the government, which is supposed to discuss it  on Wednesday, ODS Deputy Chairman Jan Strasky said at a press  conference today.    The relevant material, which Civic Democratic Alliance  Chairman (ODA) Jan Kalvoda was to give to ODS Chairman Vaclav  Klaus, was marked as party material and dated April 8, Strasky  said. He added that the Executive Council was disturbed by the  standard of the material's groundwork, which returned to  alternatives which had already been considered and rejected.  This was not in keeping with ODA's proclamations about setting  up higher local administration units as soon as possible,  Strasky said.    There is still room for improvement in coalition relations,  and the ODS Executive Council is somewhat disturbed by the  statements of several Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA)  representatives about the ODS, the party's Executive Deputy  Chairman Petr Cermak said.    The Council had repeatedly stated that there was very little  talk about the matters on which the four coalition parties  agreed, and too much emphasis on the differences in opinion,  Cermak said.    He had made "a very accommodating speech," as a guest at  last  weekend's ODA conference, he said, and believed that ODS was  tending towards a conciliatory solution to relations.    The ODS Executive Council meeting is continuing late into  the  night, with election laws and the preparation of a law on the  financing and activities of political parties on the agenda.</p>

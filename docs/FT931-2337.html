			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Evered acts to reduce borrowings EVERED BARDON, the UK building materials group, yesterday moved to reduce its large borrowings by selling a half share in part of its US operations. The company is raising Dollars 34m (Pounds 24m), after all expenses, from the sale of a 50 per cent stake in its quarrying, concrete, blacktop and builders' merchants businesses in Arkansas and Indiana to CJ Langenfelder &amp; Son, the US building materials group. Langenfelder is paying Dollars 49m for its stake in the joint venture which it will manage. Payment will be made as to Dollars 42m in cash, Dollars 6m in five-year loan notes and Dollars 1m in other deferred payments. The Indiana and Arkansas operations in the year to December 31 1991 made pre-tax profits of Dollars 4.8m. The combined net asset value of the businesses on disposal was approximately Dollars 39m. Evered will remain the sole owner of large aggregate reserves in the US, with consents to extract more than 900m tonnes in Massachusetts around Boston and in Maryland close to Washington DC. It also owns large stone quarries in England and Scotland as well as a sea sand and gravel dredging business supplying the UK and continental Europe. The company expanded rapidly following a series of acquisitions during the 1980s leaving it with large debts. The latest sale should take net borrowings below Pounds 300m. Even so gearing is likely to remain about 90 per cent. The company, which had previously identified the Arkansas and Indiana businesses as candidates for disposals, recognises that it will be under pressure to reduce its borrowings further. It will be reluctant, however, to make further sales involving what it regards as its core businesses. The sand and gravel dredging businesses is regarded by analysts as the most likely candidate for a sale if further disposals are required. Evered Bardon cut its interim dividend from 1.935p to 0.8p after pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 10.3m to Pounds 4.6m during the half year ended June 31 1992. The group, which blamed the recession in the UK and US construction markets, is expected to announce results for the whole of last year at the beginning of next month.</p>

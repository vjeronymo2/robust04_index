			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Strikes ground Iberia flights Iberia, Spain's financially crippled state airline, has been forced to ground most of its flights today as unions stage the first of two 24-hour strikes this month. The unions are objecting to the company's refusal to make up back pay that was due at the end of October and to its plans to reduce salaries by an average of 15 per cent over the next two years. The airline cancelled all its international flights serving routes that are covered by other airlines, as well as 70 per cent of its domestic flights. Iberia is on course to lose Pta44bn (Pounds 216m) this year. The industrial dispute could delay its efforts to gain European Union authorisation for fresh public funding of at least Pta125bn. Unions say Pta200bn will be required to assure future viability. A second strike is planned on November 11.</p>

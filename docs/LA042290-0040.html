			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: CLEAR AND PRESENT STAR  </P> <P> Alec Baldwin -- oh so hot, including a spread in the current Newsweek -- is in  "discussions" with Paramount about stepping back into the shoes of author Tom  Clancy's fictional hero Jack Ryan for the studio's adaptation of Clancy's  "Clear and Present Danger." If a deal can be set, Baldwin will continue the  role of the fictional CIA analyst he plays in "The Hunt for Red October."  </P> <P> "He did a wonderful job and we certainly want him," says producer Bob Rehme,  who holds movie rights to the Clancy drug-war themed thriller with partner Mace  Neufeld and Paramount. But Rehme also says there was "nothing up front" -- no  advance deal made for Baldwin to remain in the Ryan role beyond "Red October."  </P> <P> Rehme tells us that the studio is "clearly anxious" to move fast on its next  Clancy film. So fast, in fact, that filmmaker John Milius is currently doing  double duty: Wrapping up post-production on his July release, "Flight of the  Intruder," while writing the "Clear and Present Danger" screenplay.  </P> <P> "We'll have a script this summer and hope to go into production next year,"  Rehme says. "It will be a very big film involving locations on a couple of  continents, but there aren't any underwater scenes and not as many special  effects -- so it'll be easier than 'Red October.'  </P></p>

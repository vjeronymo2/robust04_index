			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] In an effort to reduce long traffic  delays on Poland's borders and to combat the country's smuggling  problems, the new head of the Main Customs Office (GUC),  Ireneusz Sekula, plans to undertake "legislative, technical, and  organizational changes" that will modernize the office and  increase efficiency, according to a report in the Warsaw weekly  GAZETA PRZEMYSLOWA I HANDLOWA (GPiH) of 8-14 March. Sekula, a  member of the SdRP (Social Democracy of the Polish Republic),  was labor minister and deputy prime minister in the governments  of Zbigniew Messner and Mieczyslaw Rakowski, respectively,  during the 1980's. In an interview in the Warsaw daily TRYBUNA  (17 March), Sekula elaborated on details concerning his "new  strategy" for the customs office.    According to TRYBUNA interviewer Cezary Rudzinski, the  customs office is the fourth-largest revenue source for the  state budget, providing over 98 trillion zlotys (Z) to the  budget last year from customs fees and taxes collected on 6  million customs clearances and postal packages. Office expenses  amounted to Z1 trillion. Sekula estimates smuggling losses of  $1-3 billion. According to the GPiH, last year alone customs  officers uncovered 16,200 smuggling attempts, twice as many as  in 1992, with the confiscated goods--mostly cigarettes, alcohol,  and cars--amounting to approximately Z2 trillion. Through  modernization and increased efficiency, GUC hopes to increase  revenues to the state budget by minimizing payments lost to  smuggling.    Sekula sees the first order of business to be in the  legislative arena. GUC, in agreement with the Ministry of  Foreign Economic Relations, has prepared a draft of "temporary  changes" to the existing customs law, presenting it to the  Economic Committee of the Council of Ministers (KERM) in March,  with the expectation that it will be reviewed by parliament  during the current term and be passed "still this year." In the  TRYBUNA interview, Sekula describes three major changes proposed  by the draft:    1) All border crossings will be subject to the central  management of GUC. As it stands now, management of individual  border crossings is relegated to the voivodships in which they  are located, resulting in uneven management, with some  voivodships "having neither the inclination nor the money to  manage them" adequately. The proposed changes would allow GUC  to organize "a financial consortium to build and manage border  crossings."    2) Many "anachronistic regulations dating back to the  1960's"  that actually limit the legal authority of the customs  inspectors need to be eliminated. Instead, the draft law  proposes the establishment of a General Customs Inspector (GIC)  and "customs police," with the "necessary legal authority" to  function effectively. When asked to further clarify the role of  the customs police, Sekula attempted to assuage the anxiety  reflected in the question by emphasizing that the customs police  "by no means" is meant to be a "gendarmerie watching over the  customs officers." Rather, its role "above all" is to uncover  smuggling and also to prevent it, making it more risky and,  hence, less profitable. To that end, the customs police would  not only inspect the consignee and check documentation, but also  "inspect the provenance" of goods for sale in stores, wholesales  firms, warehouses, and street stands.    3) Sekula intends to appeal a recent decision by the  Constitional Tribunal that views the collection of "processing  and handling fees" (oplaty manipulacyjne) by the customs service  to be a "fine" because the discontinuation of such fees would  "severely limit" and even "paralyze" the functioning of the  customs service. In particular, he views these fees as  necessary to the wage fund, allowing GUC to pay its customs  officers better. Last year alone, GUC collected Z645.6 billion  in processing and handling fees, with over half of this amount  going to "bonuses and awards." Without such fees, the average  monthly salary of a customs officer would be only Z2 million  (about $100), adding to the chances of smugglers "corrupting"  customs officers.    A "no less important issue" is that of modernizing the  technical equipment of the customs service, a project that  Sekula estimates would cost $40-100 million, an amount that  neither GUC nor the state treasury is in a position to finance.  "Specialized firms," including IBM and ICL [the British  computer firm International Computers Limited], have been  invited to bid for the position of "systems operator" of this  project. The systems operator--two may possibly be chosen--will  have its initial investment returned, "with a profit," by  charging the customs service a "fee" for the use of the system.  In turn, GUC will save administrative and equipment costs and  will be able to collect fees faster. It is expected that the  system will be speeded up by using scanners that will read "any  type of customs document," including SAD (the Standard  Administrative Document of the EU [European Union], increasingly  used in Poland) into the system and that this "will tighten the  borders" throughout the country. The "brain" of the system,  Sekula insisted, "will remain in Polish hands, in GUC."    Another technical innovation discussed by Sekula is  satellite  monitoring "of all trucks transiting Poland," required because  of the frequency, as noted by the TRYBUNA interviewer, of trucks  "disappearing somewhere in Poland"--a reference to increased  reports of theft, hijacking, and the smuggling of goods. Sekula  would also like to see the transiting TIR (the highly-regulated  European "International Transport of Goods by Road" trucking  system) vehicles placed on rail lines, a procedure that would be  inititated "beyond Poland's borders"--for example, at bases in  Magdeburg and near Berlin. Trucks would thus be "protected" on  their way from Germany to Brest (in Belarus) or Medyka (near  Przemysl, on the Ukrainian border), and drivers would be able to  rest. According to Sekula, the Germans "are extremely  interested in using rail lines for these trucks, but the  drivers "from the east" are against it, "mostly because they  receive a per diem of 35 German marks" and thus profit from the  delays in the current system, "whether they are driving or  waiting in line" to get through customs.    Sekula also discussed the issue of modernization and  personnel expansion. Even though there are at present  approximately 100 border crossings and 300 customs posts  throughout Poland, employing about 10,600 people in the central  and voivodship administrations, Sekula said, about 2,000  additional customs officers will be needed to assure a faster  and fairer customs service. The border-crossing posts require  rebuilding and modernization costing Z1.2 billion annually,  which he expects will be funded by the financial consortia that  would eventually earn "profits for the services rendered." A  program for rebuilding the border crossings "is in place."  Commenting on such efforts to modernize the service, the 14-18  March GPiH argues that "one dollar invested in strengthening the  structure, including the hiring of new customs officers, is  returned twice over in the form of greater returns of customs  fees."</p>

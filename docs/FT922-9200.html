			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Labour chief whip faces challenge MR DEREK FOSTER, Labour's chief whip, looks likely to face a formidable challenge for his post as the party's Commons business manager in an election that may be brought forward to as soon as next month. Mr John Evans, at present Labour party chairman and MP for St Helens North, is canvassing support for the job that takes on a new significance as the Conservative majority has dropped from more than 100 to 21. Speculation is also mounting over the shadow cabinet elections amid reports that Mr Gerald Kaufman, the shadow foreign secretary, and Ms Jo Richardson, voice on women's issues, may have decided not to put forward their names for nomination. If they do step down  - taken with the resignations of Mr Neil Kinnock and Mr Roy Hattersley  - it will create four vacancies. Critics of Mr Foster say he has been unduly lenient with absentee MPs. His defenders reply that Labour's strategy in the last parliament was to concentrate on building support in the country by encouraging MPs to participate in regional campaigning. That will now come to an end as the Labour whips' office concentrates its efforts on devising ambushes and harrying tactics in Westminster aimed at wearing down the government and forcing compromises on legislation. Last year Mr Foster comfortably saw off a challenge by some 80 votes from Mr Peter Snape, the West Bromwich East MP. Mr Evans, who sits on Labour's national executive as the socialist organisations' representative, is said to have won a substantial body of support already. The timing of elections for the posts of chief whip and chairman of the parliamentary Labour party, at present Mr Stan Orme, is likely to be discussed at next Wednesday's shadow cabinet meeting. While normal practice requires an election shortly after a Queen's Speech, the contest for the Labour leadership and deputy leadership has left the party in limbo, with the shadow cabinet elections also postponed until the outcome on July 18. Mr Foster and Mr Orme, who may also face a challenge, are expected to propose to the shadow cabinet that the contest for their posts should go ahead now to allow for tactical planning of parliamentary business. Such a move would happen only if the candidates in the leadership race, Mr John Smith and Mr Bryan Gould, gave their blessing.</p>

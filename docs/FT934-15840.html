			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Leading Article: Hoping for the best 'AS A CONSERVATIVE chancellor I simply cannot accept that a government should be borrowing Pounds 1 for every Pounds 6 that it spends.' These were brave words from Mr Kenneth Clarke at the Conservative party conference this week. The question is not just whether he will try to do much about it, but whether he will be allowed to by his party. What Mr Clarke should do is clear: he should eschew fiscal fine-tuning and deliver a medium-term fiscal profile that is credibly sustainable. In other words, it should look sustainable, even if everything does not turn out as Mr Clarke and his colleagues hope. Given the political timetable, most, if not all, of the fiscal adjustment should be made now. Then, with a sound fiscal position behind him, Mr Clarke could, if necessary, use monetary policy aggressively to encourage a growth of nominal demand consistent with low inflation and sustained economic growth. There are two good reasons for avoiding fiscal fine-tuning: the first is that there is little evidence that it works. The second is that the timing of the new unified Budget rules it out in any case. A November Budget is too early to make sensitive judgments about likely economic performance in the next financial year, which begins only in April 1994. But this is not a problem. It should be regarded as a blessing, instead. In making his decisions, the chancellor does at least have the luxury of a fairly satisfactory short-term position. The consensus of forecasters is that the economy will expand by about 1.6 per cent between 1992 and 1993. For next year the consensus forecast is close to 3 per cent. Even inflation is expected to remain just below the government's ceiling of 4 per cent in the year to the fourth quarter of 1994. Crowd out So far, so comfortable. The question is whether this growth can be sustained. Fiscal deficits do matter in this context, principally to the extent that they crowd out investment or are seen to threaten a rise in inflation. At present, crowding out is not a problem. But medium-term sustainability is. Last March, Mr Norman Lamont introduced a phased fiscal adjustment of Pounds 10.3bn (1.4 per cent of gross domestic product) by 1995-96. Even so the public sector borrowing requirement was forecast at 3 3/4 per cent of GDP in 1997-98, on fairly conservative assumptions about economic growth, while the ratio of net public sector debt to GDP was forecast to double between 1991 and 1998. This is not demonstrably unsustainable, but it leaves too many hostages to fortune. The further adjustment of Pounds 4bn-Pounds 6bn ( 1/2 - 3/4 per cent of GDP) being discussed by ministers is probably the minimum that is needed. To be safe, it needs to be more. The problem is that the numbers for the deficit have become too large to be politically manageable, particularly by a fractious party, possessed of a small parliamentary majority and led by an unpopular prime minister subject to constant attacks from embittered former ministers. One wing of the party insists that cuts should fall on spending. Next year's control total (public spending less the cyclical elements) of Pounds 253.6bn, should not, says Mr Lamont, the man who agreed it, remain sacrosanct. In response, Mr Clarke says that this is already the toughest spending round he can remember in '14 years as a minister'. Radical cuts Who is right? Both of them are. Mr Lamont is right that spending plans cannot remain sacrosanct if further tax increases are to be avoided. Mr Clarke is right that what is likely to be virtually no real increase in the control total is tight, at least by the sloppy standards of the last few years. If the chancellor wishes to prove his case, he need only point out that he, Mr Kenneth 'one-nation-Tory' Clarke, is demanding radical cuts in welfare benefits, while Mr Peter 'no-turning-back' Lilley is refusing them. Even Lady Thatcher herself is insisting that defence spending must be spared. Radical public spending cuts are just not going to happen. If spending cuts are difficult, tax increases look still less acceptable, particularly economically sensible ones, such as extension of VAT. VAT on fuel and power is only going to raise Pounds 2.3bn in 1995-96, a mere 5 per cent of the projected PSBR. But just listen to the fuss. Meanwhile, nobody in the Tory party is complaining much about the economically inefficient and regressive proposal to increase national insurance contributions, which is expected to raise almost exactly as much. Yet the deficit cannot be closed by loading taxes more heavily on people who do not vote Tory, for the simple reason that the party gains support from most of the people who have an appreciable taxable income. If neither radical spending cuts nor radical tax increases occur, the government is reduced to hoping for the best. Some commentators even think this is the ideal solution, so long as a dollop of cheap money is thrown in as well. It is certainly the comfortable solution. But those who rely on good luck are usually disappointed in the end.</p>

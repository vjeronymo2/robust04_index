			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Directors' Transactions DURING a week remarkable only for its quietness, directors' activities continued to be low key. London International's announcement of unexpectedly poor results led to shares falling rapidly. Immediately following the fall, two directors took the opportunity of increasing their holdings. Alan Woltz, the chairman, and Anthony Butterworth, chief executive, bought 15,000 and 50,000 shares respectively at prices around 227p. At Westport Group, the exhibition equipment company, four directors bought shares after final results were announced. Lyn Evans, David Ludlam, the managing director, and Ian McQuattie, the chief executive, each bought 250,000 shares. Currently trading at only 2p, the total value of these purchases was low; however, the impact was to double McQuattie and Ludlam's holdings and to establish Kanter's entire holding. The share price at Scottish Television has performed steadily over the past 18 months. William Brown, the chairman, has sold 79,596 shares at 403p. His previous sale was made at 290p six months ago. Brown still retains 190,000 shares.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          No of Company                  Sector      Shares    Value   directors  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES Abbott Mead Vickers      Mdia        43,000      174       2* Courtaulds               Chem        30,000      168       1* Ferrum Holdings          EngG        25,079       12       1 Johnson Matthey          Mtal        20,500       90       1* Lambert Howarth          Misc        88,600      372       2* Marks &amp; Spencer          Stor        74,476      244       1* Metro Radio Group        Mdia        23,000       39       1 Yule Catto               Chem         5,500       14       1 PURCHASES Helical Bar              Prop        90,000       95       4 London Int.

			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Yeltsin's rivals set to derail reforms, warns top minister RUSSIAN opposition forces are poised to derail economic reform and seriously undermine President Boris Yeltsin's ability to govern, a senior Russian minister warned yesterday. Mr Alexander Shokhin, the deputy prime minister for foreign economic affairs, said the future of the reforms hung on decisions to be taken today or tomorrow by an extraordinary session of the Russian Congress of Peoples Deputies. In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Shokhin said he expected deputies to vote on a motion to change the constitution which would put the power of choosing the government in the hands of the parliament - a move which would see a new government chosen in the next few weeks or months. 'They (the Congress) now have the best chance of changing the government that they have ever had,' he said, adding that anti-presidential forces had grown stronger at every Congress. Mr Shokhin's warning came as diplomats in Bonn revealed that Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, had written to fellow western leaders urging their support for Mr Yeltsin in his constitutional struggle. In particular, Mr Kohl has passed on a query from Mr Yeltsin, asking for confirmation of western political support if he is forced to introduce emergency measures. Yesterday Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker, dismissed Mr Yeltsin's most recent proposals on constitutional reform. The draft law proposed by Mr Yeltsin if parliament did not agree to his preferred option of a referendum was 'not serious' and should not be considered, Mr Khasbulatov said. But Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, deputy prime minister, warned that if Mr Yeltsin was denied a referendum or an agreement, he would run his own plebiscite. When supported by the people, he would take 'certain action against other branches of power'. Mr Shokhin said that, if the Congress accepted proposals framed last week by Mr Yeltsin, the government would tighten monetary and credit policy. If not, 'we will continue to try but it will be much more difficult'. He said if Congress 'makes one little amendment it will have power over the cabinet. This means that we would have a new government which would put forward a soft economic policy'. The government was prepared to compromise again with parliament - 'including considering personnel changes in the cabinet' - but it could not move beyond a fundamental commitment to bring down inflation and the budget deficit, and retain good relations with the west. The indications yesterday were that Mr Yeltsin would not win acceptance of these proposals, already turned down by the smaller Supreme Soviet - nor that Congress would approve the four questions he wants on the ballot paper in the referendum he wishes to hold on April 11. The questions are an attempt to achieve: agreement to Russia becoming a presidential republic a two-tiered parliament to replace the current Congress and Supreme Soviet the convening of a constitutional assembly to draw up a new constitution private ownership of land. The Supreme Soviet agreed to pass the four questions to today's meeting of Congress for a final decision. Mr Nikolai Ryabov, the deputy speaker of the parliament, said that two of the questions might be accepted, but two - on the presidential republic and the constituent assembly - were impermissible.

			<p><P> October 24, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE: 5 EXECUTIVES RESIGN AT CONTINENTAL AIR  </P> <P> Continental Airlines announced the resignation of five top executives in what  appeared to be a major housecleaning at the Houston-based carrier.  </P> <P> In a statement, Continental said the action was a "cost-efficiency measure"  intended to make Continental more competitive worldwide.  </P> <P> The action came two months after controversial former Chairman Frank Lorenzo  quit and sold his Continental stake to Scandinavian Airlines System. SAS, which  owns 18.4% of Continental's stock, was instrumental in hiring Delta Air Lines  President Hollis Harris as Lorenzo's replacement.  </P> <P> Continental said Tuesday that Harris would be given the additional role as  president, replacing Mickey Foret, who is leaving the company to pursue other  interests, officials said.  </P> <P> Others who plan to leave include Neal Neehan, senior vice president-customer  services; Clark Omstad, senior vice president-properties and government  affairs; Jim Arpey, senior vice president-aircraft programs, and Elliott  Seiden, vice president and associate general counsel for Continental Airlines  Holdings Inc.  </P> <P> Continental named Thomas Kalil senior vice president-customer service and said  Lewis Jordan, executive vice president and system general manager, was given  the additional responsibility for managing the company's international  division.  </P> <P> "With radically higher fuel costs, Continental must become a stronger  competitor in the global marketplace," said Harris, Continental's chairman and  chief executive. "We have reaffirmed our intention to become a preferred  airline among frequent travelers around the world."  </P></p>

Bulger] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg March 4 SAPA -- An African National  Congress [ANC] government would downplay South Africa's role as  a regional power in southern Africa, ANC foreign affairs  director Thabo Mbeki said on Friday. Mr Mbeki was presenting a  discussion paper, Foreign Policy in a Democratic South Africa,  to members of the media and diplomatic corps at the World Trade  Centre in Kempton Park.    The document outlines South Africa's likely international  orientation after the April elections. Rather than projecting  itself as a regional power, South Africa would emphasise  co-operation as defined in agreements with fellow southern  African nations. It would attempt to address the marginalisation  of the African continent in the world economy and would join the  Organisation of African Unity.    "Closer regional co-operation and economic integration after  apartheid will benefit the entire region," the document says. "A  democratic South Africa should explicitly renounce all hegemonic  ambitions in the region. It should resist all pressures to  become the regional power at the expense of the rest of the  sub-continent. Instead it should seek to become part of a  movement to create a new form of economic interaction in  southern Africa based on principles of mutual benefit and  interdependence."    South Africa would contribute to conflict resolution  mechanisms and peacekeeping in Africa. South Africa would also  take part in discussions about the United Nations and would  support efforts to "democratise" that body by giving  traditionally less powerful nations more scope and influence.    The foreign policy document stresses South Africa's role in  promoting human rights around the world. South Africa would  actively involve itself in international forums in pursuit of  this goal.    An ANC government would foster links with the Islamic  community of the Middle East and follow international law and  practice in its relations with Asian countries. Relations with  the European Community would be emphasised as well as bilateral  relations with individual European countries.    Diplomatic ties would also be established with Cuba. "We  believe that Cuba's right to self-determination is important in  the maintenance of international norms and principles," the  document says.    It notes its concern at the failure to finalise the Uruguay  Round of talks on the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs  (GATT) and says this could lead to damaging protectionism among  the northern countries.    On the UN, the document says: "We support endeavours to  democratise the UN. This entails reviewing the brief of both the  General Assembly and the Security Council."    On security, the document says South Africa will sign the  Geneva Convention and protocols and will be committed to  resolving disputes peacefully.    South Africa would actively support non-proliferation of  weapons of mass destruction.    South Africa would return to the Commonwealth.    A new foreign service would be established independent of  party political considerations. "We will immediately take steps  to ensure that, within a reasonable period, the diplomatic corps  will be fally representative of South Africa's people," the  document notes.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mexico City, Feb 16 (AFP) -- General Absalon  Castellanos, former governor of Chiapas was released today by  guerrillas of the Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN),  according to images transmitted live on Mexican private  television stations.    Castellanos, a division general who was held hostage by the  guerrillas since 2 January, one day after the armed Indian  revolt in the State of Chiapas was released in the town of  Guadalupe Tepeyac of Chiapas at 1605 (2205 GMT).    The local Azteca television station transmitted this  afternoon the arrival of Castellanos, 66, accompanied by armed  guerrilla youths, at the site where he was awaited by Peace  Commissioner Manuel Camacho, the mediator, and Samuel Ruiz,  bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas, as well as hundreds of  national and foreign journalists.    The town of Guadalupe Tepeyac, a zone where, according to  the  guerrillas, the Mexican Army was unable to enter during the  armed conflict, is located in a vast mountain region 200 km from  the city of San Cristobal from where a caravan of journalists  left early Tuesday to cover the event.    The former Chiapas governor's release, announced on Monday  by  Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho, is considered as the last  step prior to the start of a peace dialogue between the EZLN and  the government, the date and place of which might be announced  in the coming hours.    The guerrillas announced Tuesday that as of Thursday they  will stop collecting the war tax "in the locations where it has  been implemented" in the State of Chiapas, as "an additional  action to create an appropriate climate" for the dialogue with  the participation of EZLN leaders, Peace Commissioner Manuel  Camacho, and Monsignor Samuel Ruiz.    Gen. Castellanos, who governed Chiapas from 1982 to 1988,  was  kidnapped by the rebels at his Nuevo Momon Ranch in the  municipality of Las Margaritas, one of the principal  guerrilla-infested regions. Accused by the rebels of owning  large land estates and of being responsible for "diverse crimes"  against Indians, the 66-year-old former governor was tried by  the ELN and sentenced to life and to carry out forced labor in  an Indian community. Several days later, however, the  guerrillas decided to acquit him "so that he could bear the  shame of being pardoned" by those who were victims of the  repression when he was governor.    In statements to Mexican newsmen who interviewed him in late  January "somewhere" in the mountains of Chiapas, Castellanos  said he had been treated well and asked the government to  guarantee that after it engages in the dialogue with the rebels,  "a witch hunt" will not be unleashed in that southern state.</p>

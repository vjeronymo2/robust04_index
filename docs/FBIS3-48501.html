In the  first meeting of trade and corporate officials since NAFTA took  effect last month, the government decided to expand the foreign  investment fund from 100 billion won last year to 200 billion  won in 1994.    Officials said they hope to register the South Korea-U.S.  Industrial Cooperation Foundation this month and raise 20  million U.S. dollars by 1997 to finance joint new technology  development in nine areas chosen as main exports to the United  States. This would include semiconductors, machinery,  construction, aviation, telecommunications equipment, computers,  medical equipment, environment facilities, power generation  facilities and automobiles.    One of the concerns here on NAFTA has been the strengthened  regulation on country-of-origin labeling.    Officials said they expect makers of home appliances,  automobiles and fabrics to use locally made parts due to the new  regulations and decided to urge parts suppliers and  manufacturing companies to jointly enter the North American  market.    In case of color television sets, manufacturers must use  locally made braun tube and printed circuit board in order to be  counted as regional trade.    Officials said Korea's three major color television  exporters  -- Samsung, Goldstar and Daewoo -- have already advanced into  Mexico and will establish both assembly and parts manufacturing  lines there.    Korean car manufacturers will be urged to look into southern  states as a new region of interest to maintain their hold on the  American market, which has a relatively low 2.5 percent import  tariff, officials said.    In fabric, the government wants yarn makers, fabric dealers  and clothing companies to enter the market together, officials  said.    To counter falling behind Mexico in price competitiveness  due  to NAFTA, the government plans to open group sales outlets by  industry.    It also plans to operate both wholesale and retail outlets  in  areas with large resident Korean populations, including New  York, Chicago and Los Angeles, the officials said.</p>

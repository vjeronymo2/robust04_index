			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / The FT Interview: New voice for familiar lines - Goh Chok Tong, Singapore's prime minister There is nothing worse than coming on stage after a star performer. Mr Goh Chok Tong knows the feeling well. Since he took over as Singapore's prime minister from Mr Lee Kuan Yew in November 1990, Mr Goh has faced constant comparisons with his predecessor's achievements during his 30 years of rule. Under Mr Lee the island republic was transformed from a colonial backwater into a thriving city state, with one of the best standards of living in Asia. Income per head is now more than Dollars 12,000, one of the highest in the region and approaching the levels of Italy and the UK. Mr Goh admits Mr Lee is a hard act to follow. 'The prime minister's job is a huge one. It has been made even larger by Mr Lee Kuan Yew. Any successor will find the shoes he has left too big.' But the prime minister has signalled his intention to step out of his predecessor's shadow. 'I do not intend to wear his shoes. I shall be myself and set my own style . . .' This style, he argues, is a more open and consultative. There is more discussion of policy, he says - at least at the cabinet level of government. 'Sometimes ideas come from him (Mr Lee), sometimes it's from the other ministers, very often it's from me.' Mr Goh has also sought to ease the strict regimentation of Singaporean society, relaxing stiff restrictions on some slightly risque films. The carefully controlled Singapore media has been allowed to indulge in some mild criticism of official policies. Such moves have brought change to the island, Mr Goh says. 'There's a livelier arts scene. We set up a censorship committee. That's not just style. It came with several recommendations which we've accepted. Local plays now don't get edited by the ministry of information and arts.' For most observers, however, the extent of change has been limited. Part of the reason is the lingering influence of Lee Kuan Yew. Mr Lee took on the role of senior minister in Mr Goh's cabinet and still exercises a strong influence on policy. A 1991 ban on chewing gum - apparently because it might cause the doors on Singapore's ultra modern mass transit system to stick - is pointed to by opponents of the ruling People's Action Party as an example of the perpetuation of Mr Lee's intrusive policies. But the modest nature of change also reflects a basic agreement between Mr Goh and Mr Lee over the conduct of politics. In particular, Mr Goh shares his predecessor's toughness when it comes to dealing with perceived threats to the smooth running of Singapore. As deputy prime minister between 1985 and 1990 Mr Goh clamped down on a group of people who were campaigning for more rights for foreign workers in Singapore. The government said a Marxist conspiracy was afoot: several arrests were made. Mr Goh was also responsible in the late 1980s for restricting the circulation of foreign publications such as the Asian Wall Street Journal and the Far Eastern Economic Review for publishing articles which the government believed could cause disruption in Singapore. Such toughness, combined with his administrative capabilities lie behind Mr Goh's rise through the political establishment. Working his way steadily up the political ladder he became part of a group of 'second generation' leaders who were being prepared to take over from Mr Lee. But Mr Goh was not Mr Lee's first choice as prime minister. Like a Chinese company patriarch, Mr Lee had groomed his son, Mr Lee Hsien Loong, for the post of prime minister. Mr Lee junior, a reserve brigadier-general known as 'BG' Lee, had made a name for himself as minister of trade and industry and one of Singapore's two deputy prime ministers. Mr Goh was portrayed as a 'seat warmer' - an interim appointment until 'BG' Lee, still only in his early 40s, was thought ready for office. Mr Goh's initial political fortunes did nothing to ease the impression that his leadership would be temporary. In general elections called in mid 1991 by Mr Goh, the PAP saw its vote fall to the lowest level since the late 1960s. The opposition won its strongest showing in parliament. Although the PAP still managed to win 77 of the 81 seats and 61 per cent of the popular vote, the result was regarded as a blow to the party which has dominated Singaporean politics since independence in 1965. But circumstances then buttressed Mr Goh's position. Last November it was announced that both 'BG' Lee and Ong Teng Cheong, another deputy prime minister, had cancer. Mr Goh found himself in an entirely new position, no longer an interim appointment but a more permanent fixture. In a renewed attempt to gain what he considered a satisfactory political mandate, Mr Goh called a by-election last December in his own constituency. This time, the PAP won 72 per cent of the vote. At the same time the prime minister took over the post of PAP secretary general from Mr Lee and put his own people in principal positions. Mr Goh now appears far more politically comfortable than a year ago. 'I see myself in this job for some time to come, even had there been nothing wrong with deputy prime minister Lee.' According to Mr Goh, 'BG' Lee has responded well to cancer treatment and will return to his full role in government in the near future. Then, what many see as a battle for power between Mr Goh and the younger Lee could be resumed. If a contest does emerge, Mr Goh will find his position strengthened by Singapore's improved economic circumstances. Fears early last year of an economic slowdown due to recession in Singapore's main export markets have evaporated. The Singapore economy grew by 5.8 per cent last year. Growth of 6-7 per cent is projected for this year. Mr Goh argues that continued strong economic performance is his principal concern. Without it, he fears that the stability of the island republic might be threatened. 'I think that is part of our misfortune,' says Mr Goh. We've got to worry all the time. If we lose our competitive edge, I think the whole house may collapse. To give an example, if we are not competitive, say, with China, we'll find that China will suck in our investments very quickly . . . a hollowing out of the economy may take place very quickly . . . this anxiety element is something we've got to live with.' Anxieties about competitiveness colour other areas of government policy. The government eschews welfarism. 'We believe that if a person is given welfare, then why should he work very hard?' says Mr Goh. 'It affects the diligence and the competitiveness of the individual and the nation.' Critics in the opposition parties argue that such views ignore the fact that there are many in Singapore who need help. They say that while some have doubtless benefited from Singapore's intensely competitive environment, many have fallen by the wayside. A survey of Singapore's majority Chinese community conducted by the PAP itself identified more than 250,000 people (out of total population of 2.8m) who were 'under-achievers', in need of government help. Singapore's rulers are also accused by domestic political opponents of creating and perpetuating an elitist society. In the 1960s Mr Lee selected the best and brightest to run Singapore's government and bureaucracy. They worked hard and grew wealthy in the process. Those achievers can now afford to send their children to expensive schools and to overseas universities. Mr Goh heartily endorses the system. 'That's not elitism. We shouldn't hold anything against the children of parents who have done well. That's part of meritocracy.' It could almost be Mr Lee speaking. Such emphasis on competitiveness, stability and meritocracy echo the incessant pronouncements of the island's elder statesman. Mr Goh is the new figure at the centre of the Singapore stage. But he is still familiar with Mr Lee's script. PERSONAL FILE 1941 Born in Singapore.

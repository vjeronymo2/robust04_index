At the beginning of official talks between the two leaders  today, da Moura said that Robaina's visit has taken place at a  particularly complex moment for the Angolan people because of  the war being waged by the opposition National Union for the  Total Independence of Angola [UNITA].    The Angolan minister noted the peace efforts his government  is making to put an end to the instability produced by the  domestic conflict, which UNITA rekindled more than one year ago  after failing in the first multiparty elections.    Referring to relations with Cuba, da Moura said that in  spite  of difficulties, Angola will work to strengthen the historic  ties of cooperation with the Caribbean island.    Robaina said that his 48-hour visit to this capital forms  part of a diplomatic offensive in a changing world. Robaina  stated that the Cuban authorities are working to establish the  country in the framework in which it belongs.    He said: We cannot speak of Cuban diplomacy without  mentioning Africa and Angola, with which we are united by  fraternal and traditional ties, in particular, he said.    During his first visit to Luanda, the Cuban foreign minister  has already spoken with the Cuban medical and paramedical  personnel who work in an important metropolitan hospital and  plans to meet with Cuban experts in other fields.    Today, as part of his busy agenda, Robaina will meet with  Prime Minister Marcolino Moco and tomorrow he will be received  by Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos.    Robaina will also meet with Franca Van Dunem, president of  the Angolan Parliament.    Angola is Robaina's second stopover in his African journey.  He has already visited Ghana and will be going to Zimbabwe,  Zambia, and Namibia.</p>

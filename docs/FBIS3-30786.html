			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, Feb 8 (TANJUG) -- The Yugoslav Government  Tuesday criticized the report of Tadeusz Mazowiecki on the human  rights situation in Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) for  omitting to mention that an illegal parastatal formation was  active in Kosovo and Metohija which has the objective of joining  the Serbian province to Albania.    The government sent its commentary on the Mazowiecki report  to the participants of the 50th session of the UN Human Rights  Commission being held in Geneva from January 31 to March 11.    The illegal grouping republic of Kosovo is trying to set up  a  parallel state apparatus and power structure with the open  intention of separating the province from Serbia and the Federal  Republic of Yugoslavia.    "In line with the norms of international law this must be  treated as illegal activity jeopardizing the sovereignty and the  territorial integrity of the country in which the minority  lives," the commentary states.    Ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and Metohija reject the  Constitution of the Republic of Serbia and have at an illegal  assembly adopted the constitution of the so-called republic of  Kosovo. The Albanian minority organized a referendum on  secession with the aim of forming a parallel system of power.    The so-called Ministry of Defense of the "republic of  Kosovo," is particularly active, it has war plans, organizes the  formation and training of military units, keeps evidence of  draftees, has an agreement on the purchase of arms and military  equipment from abroad, the Yugoslav Government stresses.    That is why a group suspected of preparing an armed uprising  was arrested in September and October 1993. The group was led  by Hajzer Hajzeraj, who was declared defense minister, and Ejup  Dragaj, the so-called deputy defense minister.    The objective of the action was to maintain its sovereign  authority over the entire territory of Yugoslavia, the Yugoslav  Government stated.    Commenting the part of Mazowiecki's report related to the  rights of ethnic Albanians, Human Rights Federal Minister Margit  Savovic assessed Monday that the report insists on the  "mistreatment of Albanians" ignoring their separatist activities.    Searches conducted in Albanian houses in Kosovo and Metohija  are put on the same level as mines planted in Serb houses in  Croatia, and no mention is made of the large quantities of  weapons which were discovered by the police during these  searches, Savovic says.</p>

			<p><P> April 3, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART BUCHWALD: OILY ART OF LAYING OFF WORKERS  </P> <P> We keep reading about people getting fired in the United States -- 6,000 auto  workers, 4,000 computer analysts, 5,500 Drexel Burnham employees. What's wrong  is that the newspapers never tell us how it's done. One of the top hatchet men  in the country is Walter Widegrin, who has laid off more than a half-million  workers in his time.  </P> <P> Widegrin, known as "The Hangman," provides 24-hour service to companies that  want to push their employees in front of the firing squad. He enjoys his work  but pretends he doesn't.  </P> <P> "People blame me if they're laid off, but I can't help it when business is  lousy. Look at the Perfect Wave Suntan Oil Co. that just hired me to get rid of  10,000 workers."  </P> <P> "Did they have a problem selling suntan oil?"  </P> <P> "On the contrary," Widegrin said. "Business was good -- so good that they  decided to purchase a meatpacking plant, 1,000 VCR stores, a soccer team, a  chain of combined carryout banks and pizza parlors, and a factory to make air  bags for government bureaucrats. To finance their investments, they borrowed  money from insurance companies, credit unions and the Japanese Sushi Employees'  Pension Plan."  </P> <P> "That takes guts."  </P> <P> "Not if you issue a lot of junk bonds. The problem was that the executives who  knew everything about suntan oil didn't know a damn thing about meat, soccer,  banks, pizza or air bags. They were very determined, however, and they bought a  large airplane to fly from one company to the other so that they could find out  why they were losing so much money."  </P> <P> "So far it doesn't sound as if they did anything wrong."  </P> <P> "What they did wrong was that they ran out of cash to pay off their debts. When  this happened, the word went out on the street that Perfect Wave was  overextended. Everybody was told not to advance the company any more credit.  Without supplies it wasn't easy to make suntan oil so, like all good  executives, they made a tough business decision to lop off 10,000 heads."  </P> <P> "How can that help?"  </P> <P> "It impresses Wall Street that Perfect Wave means business."  </P> <P> "Why?"  </P> <P> "Because when you're in debt, the best way to show your creditors that you  intend to save the situation is to fire all the people that work for you. Once  we pink-slip the workers, the banks and insurance companies will be on their  knees begging to give us money."  </P> <P> "When you lop off heads, do the executives feel the blade as well?"  </P> <P> "Hopefully not, and we always make sure that when we fire a top manager, he has  a golden parachute. That way he doesn't get hurt when he bails out."  </P> <P> "I remember that they took care of all the executives at Drexel Burnham before  the roof caved in."  </P> <P> "Exactly. I was the hangman on that case -- and the big guys really came out  smelling like a rose."  </P> <P> "When you start putting the noose around the necks of the rest of the help, do  you do it alphabetically, or by age, or by length of service?"  </P> <P> "We don't have time for that. We throw a bottle of ink over the computer  printout, and whoever gets blotted is told not to show up the next day."  </P> <P> "What happens to the plane?"  </P> <P> "The top boys keep it for the new company they're putting together with their  manufacturing expertise."  </P></p>

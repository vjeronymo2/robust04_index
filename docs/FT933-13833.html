			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (21): Keep your nerve when bonuses fall - Some advisers favour the unit-linked alternative. Others say that, in a period of low inflation, returns are bound to drop / With-profits plans WITH-PROFITS funds historically have formed the backbone of the individual pensions market, but recent concerns over the risk profile of these products, bonus cuts, and the heavy-handed use of early-termination penalties, have prompted some advisers to recommend alternative arrangements, particularly to new investors. The original concept of the with-profits fund, which is invested primarily in equities, property and fixed interest, is to smooth returns by holding back some of the profits during the years of plenty to maintain a reasonable rate of return during the lean years. Premiums invested secure a modest but guaranteed fund - the 'sum assured' - which is paid when the policy matures. On top of this sum assured, profits are distributed to policyholders through the bonus system. Annual or 'reversionary' bonuses, once allocated, are also guaranteed, and for many years the combination of these bonuses plus the sum assured formed the bulk of the final pay-out, when the investor's fund is used to buy an annuity which in turn provides the pension payments. On top of these two elements, there is a final or 'terminal' bonus, which is completely discretionary and reflects the long-term capital appreciation of the with-profits fund not previously passed on through annual bonuses. In this respect, the terminal bonus is more akin to the unit-linked concept, where the return to the investor is directly linked to the performance of the underlying fund. Originally the terminal bonus represented the icing on the cake for with-profits policies, but today typically this element accounts for over 50 per cent of the total pay-out. Clearly, this is a major change to the risk profile of with-profits products. Moreover, following a period of excessively high bonus declarations during the late 1980s, many providers have started to cut bonus rates dramatically. This is one reason why consultants Bacon &amp; Woodrow are not recommending with-profits to new investors for the next few years. Bacon &amp; Woodrow also believes that with-profits plans are not sufficiently flexible in terms of early retirement, for example, and that these products do not offer competitive charging structures. Another important trend of recent years has been the introduction of 'unitised' with-profits plans. The unitised plan does not offer a basic sum assured with a guaranteed minimum return to maturity. Instead, the product offers a guaranteed return for each 12-month period, thus diluting the long-term guarantees traditionally associated with this product, while simultaneously reducing the pressure on life office reserves. One of the main problems with the unitised plan is the notorious 'market value adjuster'. This device is meant to protect the provider in the event of a run on funds following a downturn in the markets. But in practice it gives providers a free hand to reduce the value of funds when a contract is terminated early. Roy Brimblecombe, partner in charge of the insurance practice at consultants Clay &amp; Partners, warned investors to check carefully the likely impact of the market value adjuster on early retirement. 'It's vital that providers make their policy clear on this point. At present their approach is very subjective,' he said. Investors worried about these trends in the with-profits market should avoid making any panic decisions. Mr Brimblecombe stressed that it was important not to assume all providers would be equally badly hit by bonus cuts. 'Each provider should be examined in detail, and its bonus declaration should be compared with its return on the underlying assets,' he said. Angela Cooper, manager, technical research, at consultants Noble Lowndes, added: 'The important point is to look at the real rate of return provided by with-profits policies. Unlike the 1980s, we are in a period of low inflation, and returns will drop accordingly. In the short term, despite the bonus cuts, with-profits might still provide a satisfactory rate of real return, particularly when compared with the low-risk alternatives such as cash and fixed interest.' Clive Grimley, senior manager with consultants Gissings, stressed that existing investors should maintain their with-profits plans. 'Certainly, if you have had a with-profits plan for some years, you should maintain it, and it may even be appropriate to increase premiums. However, those thinking of making new investments, particularly if it is in the run up to retirement, should consider alternative arrangements.' Mr Grimley highlighted the importance of seeking expert help on the choice of funds under unit-linked plans. Most advisers tend to recommend managed funds, but a closer comparison with the risk profile of the with-profits funds can be found elsewhere. He said: 'For short-term, low-risk pension investment, we might recommend the following allocation to unit linked funds: 20 per cent in property, 20 per cent in deposit and 60 per cent in a range of gilts, fixed interest, index-linked and convertibles.' Finally, Andrew Warwick-Thompson, head of Bacon &amp; Woodrow's partnership pensions section, outlined his investment philosophy: 'We take the view that equities will be the best performing asset class in the long term. The property and fixed-interest elements of with-profits funds are therefore likely to act as a drag on performance. Consequently, investment in well managed, equity-based unit-linked funds is likely to produce returns superior to most with-profits funds in the long term.' B&amp;W's own research concluded that there were four managed unit-linked personal pension providers currently offering the best combination of performance, good administration, sound financial strength and a low charging structure free of hidden penalties. These were: Rothschild Asset Management (a unit trust product), Standard Life, National Mutual and Scottish Widows.</p>

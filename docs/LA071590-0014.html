			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR SOME READERS, TIFFANY IS NO JETSON  </P> <P> An item in the July 8 Outtakes column begins, "One person who won't be buying a  ticket to 'Jetsons: The Movie': actress Janet Waldo." Make it three: Janet  Waldo, my sister and I.  </P> <P> I was pretty excited when I heard that the Jetsons were coming out in an  animated feature.  </P> <P> I grew up with that cartoon. Then I read many articles concerning this Judy  Jetson incident, one being Kyle Counts' Outtakes item, "Not a Genuine Tiffany."  </P> <P> From just listening to Judy Jetson's voice in the movie previews, I could not  connect with the Jetsons. It just wasn't the same Jetsons I grew up with. Judy  Jetson was not the real Judy Jetson without Janet Waldo's voice. The Judy I  heard was an imposter.  </P> <P> I'm sure many people feel the same way. How could Hanna-Barbera (the producers)  do such a thing?! It boils down to greed. Why couldn't Tiffany just be happy  with recording the soundtrack? Did she have to steal Waldo's role as well?  </P> <P> CHRISTINA Y. CHANG  </P> <P> Palos Verdes  </P> <P>  Waldo, the voice of Judy Jetson in the animated TV series, had reprised the  role in the movie before being replaced by singer Tiffany.  </P> <P> </P></p>

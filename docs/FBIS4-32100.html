			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by KAZ: "No NBP Consultation Over `Strategy for </F> Poland'; Consolidation Before Privatization"]    [Text] The Polish National Bank [NBP] was not  consulted by the authors of the Strategy for Poland program  concerning issues related to reforms in the banking sector.  There is talk that one of our departments was apparently  contacted, but there was neither any special group formed nor an  exchange of official letters on the topic, NBP Chairwoman Hanna  Gronkiewicz-Waltz told NOWA EUROPA.    In the Program, activities of the NBP were assessed quite  critically. It was said that, while issuing money, supervising  other banks, and performing ownership functions at the same  time, the central bank does not perform any of these functions  properly. According to Gronkiewicz-Waltz, there are no reasons  to support such an argument. The central bank always forces the  government to grant it concessions to decrease the budget  deficit. We are the ones who make the reduction of the  inflation rate happen. There is already some progress in the  area, even though things could be better. As for supervision,  the NBP knows what is happening among other banks, and it has  compiled a detailed diagnosis on the topic. Still, if the state  budget wants to take over banks being supervised by the NBP, I  will gladly give them up, stated the chairwoman.    So, as to taking the NBP's suggestions into account, a  provision on separating banking supervision out of the central  bank's structure and on organizing the supervision in the form  of an independent institution was removed from an initial  version of the Strategy program. The independent institution  form exists in only four EC countries. When it comes to Belgium  and France, the independence of banking supervision is only  apparent, while, for instance, in Finland, there is a trend to  merge the functions.    The NBP chairwoman also expressed the view that, if one  wants  to establish several strong banks, one must consolidate them  first and privatize them later. Once the banks go onto the stock  market, any mergers will be practically impossible. Still,  privatization is also needed because state-owned financial  institutions are characterized by low efficiency dynamics.  Their higher profitability, compared with the average value for  the sector as a whole, is not a result of better management but  is, instead, a result, for instance, of lower costs for  obtaining money.</p>

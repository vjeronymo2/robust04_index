			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / Socialist win unsettles Hungarian business: Why an absolute majority is not necessarily cause for rejoicing An absolute majority like that gained by the reformed communists in Hungary's elections on Sunday is normally cause for rejoicing. And the mood in the Socialist party headquarters on election night was euphoric even if one old-fashioned supporter did get carried away on the entry of Socialist leader Mr Gyula Horn, crying out: 'Long live the party.' But the Budapest business community does not make the positive equation between comfortable majority, one-party government and stability that is standard in the West. Nor are the free marketeer technocrats among the Socialists overjoyed by the extent of the party's defeat of the liberals and governing conservatives. Some might share the comment of their opponents, drawing on Hungary's rich reservoir of animal metaphors, that the electorate has got up on to its horse only to fall off the other side. The size of the Socialist success - the party won 209 seats to give it a majority of 32 - has emboldened the left-wing of the party. Mr Gyula Horn, the 61-year-old Socialist party president and a long-time communist, reasserted the Socialists' western orientation in his victory speech, saying his first visit would be to Bonn. But he also indulged in the kind of left-wing rhetoric that had been absent from Hungarian politics since the communists lost power in 1990. 'Finally the tower-block estates, the industrial areas and the villages have a voice in Hungarian political life,' he said. The scale of the election victory, which exceeded even the Socialists' forecasts, also reduces the likelihood of a coalition mooted with the liberal Alliance of Free Democrats, which came second with 70 seats. That is the combination privately favoured by many in the business and diplomatic communities, for it would provide an institutional guarantee that the Socialists would stick to the western oriented and free-market platform that they propound. Mr Horn said he would, notwithstanding the left's absolute majority, seek talks with the Free Democrats. But the Socialist party is now likely at a congress later this week to nominate Mr Horn as its candidate for prime minister. The liberals regard Mr Horn, who served in the workers' militia that helped suppress Hungary's 1956 uprising against communist rule, as a divisive figure. The Free Democrats have not formally ruled out serving in a government led by Mr Horn. But party president Mr Ivan Peto said yesterday that there would have to be a guarantee that the new government would pursue a liberal economic line. That appears to mean that the Free Democrats would insist the premiership go to Mr Laszlo Bekesi, the Socialists' free marketeer economics spokesman and a former finance minister, or to Mr Miklos Nemeth, the reformist prime minister before 1990, now at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Mr Horn appears reluctant, however, to sacrifice the power which is in his grasp for the sake of coalition. 'He wants it as much as it is possible for anybody to want anything,' says a leading liberal. Mr Bekesi was conspicuously absent from the line-up of Socialist party leaders at their victory press conference and Mr Nemeth is in London and deemed out of touch by the Socialist leader. So the betting in Hungarian political circles is that the revamped communists will govern alone and under Mr Horn. Mr Bekesi has said that only a broad and solid coalition could implement the austerity programme necessary to contain twin current account and budget deficits. No one suggests that the left, unrestrained by coalition, will return to communism. But one-party government has uncomfortable connotations for sensitive Hungarians after the one-party dictatorship under which they suffered for four decades. Editorial comment, Page 15</p>

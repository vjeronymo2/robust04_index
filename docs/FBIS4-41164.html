			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Text] Here is our correspondent Yuriy Rostov on the  Russian premier's visit to the United States.    [Begin Rostov recording] Today Prime Minister Chernomyrdin,  who arrived in Washington yesterday, took part in the work of  the American-Russian commission for economic cooperation.  Chernomyrdin and Vice President Gore are co-chairmen of that  commission. Today the sides completed discussion of several  agreements, including the 400 million dollar contract on the  joint exploration of space and the Sakhalin-2 agreement. The  latter document envisages the development of yet another sector  of the Sakhalin oil-bearing shelf. American and Japanese banks  are planning to invest ten billion dollars in the project. The  profit over a period of 25 years will be be 50 billion dollars.    Last year the session of the Russian-American commission was  to have been held in June too, although it took place in  September. This time the session of the commission has started  on time, just like today's meeting at the U.S. Congress. One of  the most important subjects discussed was the need to finally  remove the restrictions in U.S. legislation on trade with Russia  which has not been communist for a long time now.

			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / International Company News: Trelleborg posts sharp turnround Rising metal prices and reduced financial costs enabled Trelleborg, the Swedish mining and metals group, to report a SKr534m (Dollars 75.54m) profit for the first nine months. The result compares with a SKr884m loss in the same 1993 period. The turnround came in spite of a fall in sales to SKr14.05bn from SKr15.72bn caused by restructuring. A better performance from the group's four main divisions - mines and smelters, rubber products, metal processing and distribution - enabled operating profits to rise to SKr615m from SKr64m. There was also a SKr296m contribution from associated companies, after last year's SKr173m loss, due mainly to higher earnings from Falconbridge, the nickel producer. The third element in the turnround was the fall in net financial costs to SKr377m from SKr775m, reflecting lower debt levels and interest rates. The best performance came from the mines and smelters division which swung to a SKr137m operating profit from a SKr191m deficit. The unit has benefited from higher prices for copper, lead, nickel, gold and silver. Mr Kjell Nilsson, group president, said the positive trend continued for all business areas.</p>

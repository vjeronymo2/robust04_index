			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Profits under threat on crumbling pampas - The growing problem of soil erosion on Argentina's grain lands It seems almost unbelievable that Argentina's vast and prodigiously fertile pampas could ever succumb to soil erosion. In many parts of the pampas the black topsoil is over a metre deep and the land is so rich that farmers use little fertiliser, even though they harvest two crops a year. Nevertheless, a third of the pampas is now affected by moderate to severe soil erosion. Agronomists say that, while the problem is far from catastrophic in all but a few small black spots, farmers must change their ways to avoid an inexorable decline in crop yields. A sustained drop in productivity would be very bad news for a country that relies on the soyabeans, wheat and beef produced on the pampas for almost 40 per cent of its exports. Reliable figures are hard to come by. The Centre for Promotion of Soil and Water Conservation estimated in 1986 that 13.5m hectares (8.4m acres) of the pampas - which cover 40m hectares, an area larger than many European countries - were affected by soil erosion. Furthermore, about one-fifth of the degraded area was already severely eroded. Five years earlier, the agriculture department estimated that soil erosion was costing dollars 100m a year in falling maize yields alone. It added that it cost a further dollars 20m a year to dredge ports silted up with soil swept into rivers by rainwater. No effort has been made since to measure the advance of soil erosion or assess its impact. Experts can only assume that the problem has grown worse since then. 'Obviously we are not talking about desertification,' says Mr Octavio Prez Pardo, a government soil erosion specialist. 'By most standards, the soil in degraded areas is still quite good. But instead of being thick, black and spongy, the soil looks grey and loses its spring. That is when we warn farmers they must start looking after their land.' Degraded soil loses its ability to soak up rainwater. Instead, it courses across the land, carrying away topsoil and reducing fertility, crop yields and profits. Incomes diminish, reducing farmers' ability to invest in the land and combat erosion, locking them into a vicious circle of declining yields and incomes, leading to permanent erosion in some cases. Soil erosion has been speeded by a shift in land use since the 1960s, when farmers began to abandon crop rotation. Crop rotation is an age-old practice in which different crops are grown in rotation and the land regularly left to lie fallow and used as pasture. This allows the land to 'rest' and be naturally fertilised by cattle droppings. In the 1960s, however, farmers began reducing their cattle herds and switching to intensive production of soyabeans and wheat in response strong international demand for grains. To make matters worse, though scientists are unsure why, soyabeans speed soil erosion. A similar trend is afflicting Brazil's soyabean belt in the southern states of Rio Grande do Sul and Parana. Mr Gustavo Grobocopatel, an agronomy lecturer at the University of Buenos Aires, says that in some badly degraded areas, farmers have stopped planting maize because it is especially susceptible to declining soil fertility; they have replaced it with soyabeans, further accelerating erosion. Far from declining, however, average national yields have actually improved since the mid-1980s. This may be because farmers are using more weedkillers and fertilisers. But Mr Neri Simonetti, a government agronomist, warns that 'you can suppress the impact of erosion for a time with agrochemicals and you can even increase yields. But in the end it will not work: yields will come down.' In some prime maize regions, yields are now down by about 10 per cent. Efforts to deal with soil erosion have clearly made little headway. Congress passed a soil conservation law in 1981, offering subsidies to farmers who adopted conservation techniques. But oftern farmers spent the money on new cars or paying bills. The subsidies declined as the economy sank into chaos. In 1989 the government cut off the subsidies altogether. Agronomists complain that farmers are unwilling to change old habits. In any case, soil erosion is a problem that builds up slowly and few farmers notice it. Switching to soil-friendly farming is expensive at first, and the rewards take time to become apparent. So farmers baulk at the added cost of contour farming or buying cattle. Officials hope, however, that they will learn that going easy on the soil will eventually improve yields, raise income and improve land prices. However bad the situation may be, it is far from irreversible. Unlike the arid Patagonian steppes that are threatened by desertifiaction, the Pampas are still extraordinarily fertile. Argentina began farming the plains less than a century ago, so the soil is still in comparatively good shape. Furthermore, enlightened farmers are adopting new techniques, like crop rotation, contour farming, and no-till farming. Mr Grobocopatel explains: 'No-till farming is a technique developed in the United States, in which stubble is left standing after harvest and the next crop sown directly on top'. This conserves the soil because, unlike ploughing, it does not disturb its structure. Farmers now use the no-till system on about 500,000 hectares, ten times the area three years ago. The main reason for the techniques popularity, however, is its cheapness rather than its friendliness to the environment. And Mr Simonetti points out that farmers have to use more environmentally- unsound agrochemicals to control weeds, which also flourish in untilled, fertile soil.</p>

Ghawshah pointed out that the PLO Executive Committee met  under Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat last night. The  committee discussed the practical measures needed to implement  UN Security Council 904 on the massacre at al-Ibrahimi Mosque.  The resolution, Ghawshah noted, calls for international  protection for the Palestinian people.    Ghawshah added that the committee also reviewed the outcome  of 'Arafat's meeting yesterday with an Israeli delegation under  Amnon Shahaq. The Israeli delegation brought no new proposals  concerning the practical measures needed to implement the UN  Security Council resolution, despite the fact that Israeli Prime  Minister Yitzhaq Rabin told 'Arafat in a telephone conversation  two days ago that the delegation would convey such proposals.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Reference news" by Lei Hsi (7191 2497): "Prisoners in </F> Guiyang Stage a Rebellion]    [Text] On the morning of 2 March, prisoners working on a  construction site on a highway near Huaxi Reservoir, Guiyang,  staged a rebellion. They disarmed armed policemen with their  tools and shouted: "Run for your lives!" Over 300 of the 500  prisoners ran into the hills.    Sources said that 12 armed policemen were beaten to death  and  over 100 prisoners were placed on the wanted list. Latest  sources have disclosed that 30 or so prisoners are still at  large. The cause of the rebellion was that the prisoners could  not tolerate the heavy workload. Prior to this, they had always  been slack in work. These prisoners were criminal prisoners for  terms of 15 years or more, and their age range is between 20 to  30.</p>

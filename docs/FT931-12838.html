			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Airtours steps up campaign for Owners Abroad AIRTOURS, the holiday company, yesterday stepped up its campaign to show that the industry would remain 'highly competitive' if its hostile bid for rival tour group, Owners Abroad, were successful. In a letter to the Consumers' Association, Mr David Crossland, Airtours chairman, described as 'grotesque' the suggestion that it would combine with Thomson, the market leader, to create a duopoly. A copy of the letter is being sent to the Office of Fair Trading which was last week asked by the Consumers' Association to recommend a referral to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission Airtours is expected to explain its case to MPs, pressure groups and the OFT before the Department of Trade and Industry decides whether to refer the bid. In its letter, Airtours accused the Consumers' Association of distorting statistics. Its claim that a combined Airtours and Owners Abroad would have a 34 per cent market share, ahead of Thomson, was wrongly based on extrapolating November's figures for summer bookings. Airtours holidays always sold well early in the booking season and combined market share was likely to be 25 to 27 per cent. Airtours said all the evidence showed there was 'intense price and other competition' in the market and that there had been no fundamental changes in the industry since Thomson took over Horizon in 1989. Mr Crossland said when the MMC cleared Thomson's takeover of Horizon the markets were 'characterised by strong if variable growth, extensive competition and continued entry by firms new to the industry'. Rather than working against consumers' interests, Mr Crossland says Airtours has consistently introduced new products, for example starting long-haul charter operations to places such as Barbados. 'The greater the volume, the more confident you can be with higher risk (more distant) destinations,' said Mr Crossland. 'Providing you are price competitive and gave people a good holiday the year before then you are in the frame for being chosen.' There was also no advantage for a tour operator in concentrating the sale of holidays through its own travel agencies. Last year's purchase of Pickfords would only give Airtours about 8 per cent of total travel agency bookings.</p>

			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / IMF timing crucial for Yeltsin THE TIMING of the announcement of an IMF quota larger than that originally offered, of imminent membership of the IMF itself (and thereafter the World Bank) and of Group of Seven support for the rouble is crucial to the future of Mr Boris Yeltsin's government. It comes just before the Congress of Peoples' Deputies which opens on Monday: and Mr Yeltsin, Russian President and his economic reform team led by Mr Yegor Gaidar, the deputy prime minister, badly need something which they can announce with eclat. That the IMF should act in this way is easily understood. For its officials, the Russian government is not perfect but is seen as by far the best interlocutor they are likely to get. There have been fears that Mr Yeltsin might be listening to those who want the government to go. Those fears were partially allayed yesterday when Mr Yeltsin told the official news agency Itar-Tass that 'we cannot sacrifice the reformist government, which is truly reformist. It is a bold, cohesive and young team.' That Mr Yeltsin felt obliged to put a shot across the bows of those deputies who feel that the team should be disbanded shows he anticipates a struggle. Although, his vice-president, Mr Alexander Rutskoi, appears to have been brought into line by Mr Yeltsin: yesterday, he said he would support the government continuing in office. Russia's deputies are split into three camps: those who support the government's hard line; those who do not wish to see it dismissed but want it to soften the line; and those who want the government to go. There is presently no way of testing the relative strengths of the three groups. Among those offering 'constructive' opposition is Professor Yevgeny Yasin, chief economist for the Russian Union of Industrialists and himself employed by the government sage to the parliament. He supports the government's broad policies, and thinks it important to sustain them, but he believes the government must heed the cries of the industrialists. 'The government should loosen the tight credit policy. It must see that it cannot at the same time succeed in liberalisation of the economy and stabilisation of the currency: and liberalisation of the economy is more important.' The 'destructive' opposition, on the other hand, will take a variety of forms. Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the leader of the parliament, has on every occasion voiced his critique of the government and insistently calls for its dismissal. He has promoted the views of Mr Nikolai Petrakov, the former economic adviser to Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, who believes that the economy cannot recover from the shocks now being administered to it. He will find support from deputies who fear an executive appointed without their consent (since they gave Mr Yeltsin the right to appoint the cabinet without reference to them) and who resent what they see as the arrogance of the ministers - especially Mr Genady Burbulis, the first deputy prime minister. Their pressure has already removed Mr Sergei Shakhrai, a deputy prime minister who fell foul of a law which prohibits deputies from holding government office or leading political parties. Three other ministers or senior government officials are in the same position. Mr Burbulis, in an interview yesterday with the weekly Moscow News, did nothing to win popularity by dismissing many of the deputies' concerns as self-interested and narrow minded - arguing that all alternatives to the economic course taken by the cabinet must be understood to be 'artificial and senseless.' The lines are being drawn for the struggle: it will be intense, since the process through which Russia is passing is intensely painful.</p>

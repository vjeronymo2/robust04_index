			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture (Week in the markets): Strike nerves push platinum higher NERVOUSNESS ahead of next week's national strike in South Africa pushed platinum prices up sharply at the end of the week. South Africa accounts for about two thirds of the total platinum supplies. An earlier downtrend had been encouraged by Tuesday's announcement that a pay settlement had been reached between management and unions at Impala Platinum, South Africa's second biggest producer. But that slide was reversed on Thursday, when the price rose Dollars 3.75 to Dollars 376.25 a troy ounce, and yesterday a further Dollars 9 was added, taking the price to Dollars 385.25 at the afternoon fix, up Dollars 4.90 on the week. The two-day South African strike that is scheduled to begin on Monday had already been discounted at the price ruling before the rise of the last two days, but the market nevertheless became increasingly edgy as it drew nearer. 'Nobody wanted to go into the weekend short. . . and the early buying caused a panicky scramble to get covered,' one dealer explained yesterday. He said there was concern that situation in South Africa might get out of control once the strike was under way. The gold price moved up with platinum yesterday, rising Dollars 1.35 to Dollars 357.95 an ounce, up 50 cents on the week. At the London Metal Exchange nickel prices came under increasing pressure as stocks in exchange warehouses surged by 6,924 tonnes to an all-time high of 34,560 tonnes. That compared with 11,922 tonnes at the start of the year and 6,420 tonnes 12 months ago and beat the previous record of 32,664 tonnes set in March 1984. A decisive breach of support at around Dollars 7,500 a tonne for three months metal prompted further selling yesterday and by the close the price was Dollars 7,417.50 a tonne, down Dollars 75 on the day and Dollars 205 on the week. The uptrend in LME lead stocks also continued this week, the total rising another 1,600 tonnes to 148,800 tonnes. But that bearish factor was easily outweighed by Thursday's news that workers had gone on strike at Doe Run's Herculaneum smelter in the US, which has an annual capacity of 225,000 short tons (2,000 lb). The cash price rose immediately by Pounds 17 to Pounds 353.50 a tonne, but was trimmed yesterday to Pounds 349.25, up Pounds 7.25 on the week, as the company said the smelter might restart on Monday, run by salaried staff. The announcement of a modest fall in LME aluminium stocks helped prices to steady a little yesterday following a run of chart-inspired losses earlier in the week. The cash price closed at Dollars 1,316.50 a tonne, up Dollars 6 on the day but Dollars 21 down on the week. Some traders said that the flood of Russian aluminium that had driven the exchange stockpile to unprecedented levels over the past 18 months had slowed to a trickle as production difficulties got the better of the country's hard-pressed producers. Shortages of cash, alumina (aluminium oxide) and spare parts, combined with transport difficulties suggested that Russian claims that exports were being maintained at 75 per cent of last year's level (estimated at 1m tonnes) would not stand close examination, they said. Despite concern about Polish copper workers' plans to intensify their strike action against the KGHM combine copper prices declined for most of the week. A fall in LME stocks aided a Pounds 6.50 rally yesterday, however, and the cash price closed at Pounds 1,315.50 a tonne, Pounds 25 down on the week. When three months delivery tin breached the Dollars 7,000-a-tonne level on Monday traders suggested that with chart patterns looking bearish a further slide was on the cards. And they were not disappointed. Despite recovering Dollars 20 yesterday the price ended the week Dollars 207.50 down on balance at Dollars 6,835 a tonne. The coffee market got little inspiration from talks going on in London this week on a new price-stabilising international coffee agreement and the September futures price ended Dollars 8 down on balance at Dollars 745 a tonne. 'If you look at what has happened over the past week, then we haven't achieved much. The prevailing feeling is one of frustration,' producer spokesman Mr Valdemar Carneiro Leao of Brazil told the Reuter news agency yesterday. The producers' disappointment stems from what they regard as the inflexibility of certain consumers on the issue of controls. In particular they are concerned that leading consumers such as the US are prepared to accept coffee without proper documentation. Producers feel consumers should be more committed to controlling imports at their end.  ----------------------------------------           LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS         (As at Thursday's close)  ---------------------------------------- tonnes Aluminium   -3,575 to 1,321,225 Copper      -2,200 to   251,350 Lead          +625 to   148,800 Nickel      +4,650 to    34,560 Zinc        +2,375 to   341,475 Tin           +380 to    14,950  ----------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UNFINISHED BUSINESS AT THE HAMMER MUSEUM;  </P> <P> ARTS: WESTWOOD CENTER'S BUSINESS PLAN PROJECTS HEFTY PROFITS EVEN AS FINANCIAL  TROUBLES SEEM TO BE CURTAILING CONSTRUCTION OF THE MOST LUCRATIVE FACILITIES.  </P> <P> Though legally established as a nonprofit entity, the Armand Hammer Museum of  Art and Cultural Center, under construction in Westwood, sees itself as an "an  entrepreneurial venture" that will make hefty profits, according to a key  document obtained by The Times.  </P> <P> But at the same time, meetings under way at the headquarters of Occidental  Petroleum Corp., which is financing the museum, are apparently close to  producing a decision that cost overruns have made it impossible for the museum  to complete several key facilities.  </P> <P> The contradictory images of the museum as a high-return business bonanza but  also cost-hamstrung project that faces significant difficulty have emerged in  newly disclosed documents pertaining to the project and from sources close to  its financing.  </P> <P> In its official business plan, copies of which have surfaced in the last few  weeks, the museum has projected a net profit of more than $1.5 million in its  first year of operation. And in an ambitious marketing program, the Hammer  museum emphasizes the crucial role in its operation of high profit margins.  </P> <P> It dismisses the potential for "competitive threats" from other museums as  unlikely because Southern California's existing museum and nonprofit cultural  communities "react very slowly to changes."  </P> <P> By cutting back on services central to the operation of most museums --  including elimination of any curatorial department -- and taking advantage of  the lack of vigor among other area cultural centers, the Hammer facility boasts  that it will seize a position as "The Museum in Southern California."  </P> <P> The business plan details for the first time the actual operational style of  the Hammer museum, which is named for Occidental Petroleum Corp. Chairman  Armand Hammer, one of the nation's most prominent and controversial art  collectors. Hammer decided to construct the museum -- initially at an estimated  cost of $50 million in Occidental funds -- in late 1987 after he pulled out of  an agreement to donate his art collection to the Los Angeles County Museum of  Art.  </P> <P> Since then, the Hammer museum has been hamstrung by construction cost overruns  and by the emergence of new details -- chiefly in court documents filed in a  Delaware shareholder lawsuit challenging the propriety of Occidental  Petroleum's expenditures on the project -- that have established that the oil  company, and not Hammer, actually paid for a collection of Leonardo da Vinci  drawings that makes up one of the three central elements of Hammer's  collection.  </P> <P> Late last year, overruns threatened to push the construction cost as high as  $80 million and Occidental Petroleum officials stepped in to demand reductions  -- to a total of not more than $60 million. The museum is scheduled to open  later this year.  </P> <P> Moreover, museum officials across the country -- including the director of the  Phillips Collection in Washington, which the Hammer museum business plan  identifies as highly similar to the vision it has for itself -- questioned many  Hammer financial premises.  </P> <P> Sources familiar with the Hammer museum situation said meetings have been under  way this week at Occidental Petroleum to put in final form reductions in the  museum construction budget in which oil company officials have apparently  decided the Hammer facility cannot afford to complete its library, restaurant  and auditorium. The apparent decision closely parallels a proposed resolution  of the cost overrun problem Occidental officials first broached late last year.  </P> <P> But in the business plan, the restaurant and auditorium are characterized as  major profit centers. Occidental Petroleum on Wednesday declined to discuss the  museum's business plan, the reported cost-control activities or the meetings  reportedly occurring this week. "I would just say that we're in litigation and  would have no comment," said Frank Ashley, an Occidental spokesman.  </P> <P> The business plan describes the restaurant as a place where "one might have  seen Monet sipping his espresso over afternoon repast at a similar cafe of the  period." And to the consternation of many museum directors, who say museum  restaurants often are notorious money-losers, the Hammer plan anticipates  $82,000 in first year cafeteria profits -- and $298,000 by 1994.  </P> <P> The auditorium, which would be rented by an aggressive sales force operating  chiefly on commission, projects profits in the business plan of between  $292,000 and $547,000 a year. Not operating the facilities could cut the profit  even under the business plan's formula by nearly 50% by 1995. The business plan  makes no provision for an inability to open any of the museum's promised  facilities.  </P> <P> Instead, the plan sees the Hammer museum as a bottom line bonanza with rates of  return of between 20% and 26.2% -- profit margins that would be the envy of  virtually every retail business in California. By the 1994-1995 fiscal year,  the Hammer museum envisions making nearly $2 million a year on revenues of  slightly less than $7.6 million.  </P> <P> The optimistic details are contained in a confidential business plan for the  institution that has been among the most closely held of all museum documents.  The plan, however, does not indicate how the anticipated profits will be spent.  The museum plan includes no indication of expanding scholarly programs that  will be financed by the millions of dollars in anticipated black ink.  </P> <P> A copy of the business plan is among thousands of pages of documents on file in  Delaware state chancery court in Wilmington in a shareholder suit that seeks to  derail construction of the museum as an improper use of funds of the Occidental  Petroleum Corp.  </P> <P> But the copy in official court files is completely illegible. The Times  obtained readable versions of the documents from Occidental and other sources.  </P> <P> The museum is being built to house Hammer's personal art collection, which has  been valued at as much as $450 million.  </P> <P> "The (Hammer museum) will fill an acknowledged cultural void that is perceived  in sophisticated cities around the world," the business plan promises. The  museum "will quickly establish itself as one of the finest museums on the West  Coast and in the country. It will be the Museum in Southern California."  </P> <P> But the business plan appears to envision the Hammer museum chiefly as a  profit-oriented business and not a cultural or scholarly institution. The  museum, the business plan contends, "will employ an aggressive marketing  strategy, treating the museum as an entrepreneurial venture that must be  profitable as opposed to the stereotypical 'nonprofit' museum that is a money  loser.  </P> <P> "An emphasis will be on 'creative financing.' A perpetual monthly award will go  the the employee who implements the most creative (legal) method of obtaining a  product or service."  </P> <P> At the same time, the business plan appears to dismiss virtually the entire  Southern California museum community as worthy cultural partners or business  affiliates. "Competitive threats to the museum are very unlikely from existing  museums or any new museums since the (Hammer) museum and nonprofit industries  react very slowly to changes."  </P> <P> Specifically, the plan shows the museum anticipates:  </P> <P> * Profits totaling $7.94 million in its first five years of operation on  revenues of $34.3 million. The museum also proposes to recruit 24 wealthy  "founding members" -- individuals or corporations. To maintain their status in  the museum, the founding members would be required to donate $50,000 a year to  the enterprise.  </P> <P> * An attendance fee system in which admission charges would be eliminated, but  would be replaced by the sale of "daily memberships" in the museum, of between  $2 and $4.50 per person. Income from membership sales is projected at $1.2  million in the museum's first year of operation.  </P> <P> * First year attendance of 330,000, growing at a rate of between 5% and 25%  annually until 1994-95, when 526,000 customers are anticipated.  </P> <P> * A bare-bones staff that includes no curator and projects a salary for the  museum's sole full-time education department employee of $10,000 a year. The  library -- the opening of which is apparently threatened -- would be staffed by  one librarian and a student assistant. The security force would consist of 20  retired people who would be paid $500 a month.  </P> <P> * No in-house conservation department -- despite the enormous value of many of  the Hammer artworks. Outside conservation contractors would be used at a first  year cost of$10,000. To avoid paying for health care and pension benefits for  as many of its employees as possible, the museum would make maximum use of  part-time workers.  </P> <P> But the business plan details are seemingly at odds with practices of many  established institutions. Museum officials across the country challenged the  realism of the document. Though the Hammer museum identifies itself as similar  in style, scope and audience with Washington's Phillips Collection, that  institution's director was openly skeptical of the Hammer museum's proposals.  </P> <P> "I don't know the circumstances of Westwood and what kinds of crowds can be  collected," said Laughlin Phillips, of the Phillips Collection. "But it would  be very hard for us to even come close to those figures."  </P> <P> The long-established Phillips Collection, which has just completed an ambitious  expansion and renovation program and is perceived as the premier modern art  facility in the nation's capital, draws fewer than half the number of visitors  the Hammer museum projects, Phillips said. Although the Phillips Collection has  revised its business practices and undergone a period of what Phillips called  "tremendous growth" in the last decade, he said the museum's operating budget  for 1988 -- the last full fiscal year the museum has completed -- was only  about $3 million.  </P> <P> Phillips particularly questioned the Hammer museum's plan to hire a museum  director for $70,000 a year. "For the director, I think it would be very hard  to find somebody at that amount. I presume they're looking for somebody who's  already well known. They'd have to go higher."  </P> <P> Los Angeles museums also questioned some of the Hammer projections. The J. Paul  Getty Museum in Malibu, for instance, said its modern plant requires a security  force of 50 people -- double the Hammer contingent -- to adequately guard its  priceless artworks.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art said that although it is widely  perceived as a model of successful operations in a new museum, its 1989  attendance was only 287,000. The museum showed an operating loss of $77,000 on  revenues of $7.6 million.  </P> <P> In all, said Phillips, even without the construction budget setbacks that have  troubled the Hammer museum, the business plan seems to describe a situation  that may be little more than a pipe dream. "To hear that an institution can  zoom out of the starting gate so quickly and immediately turn a profit," he  said, "does seem to me unrealistic."  </P></p>

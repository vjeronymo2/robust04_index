			<p><P> July 30, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> A 25% SALARY INCREASE FOR COUNTY SUPERVISORS  </P> <P> In November, I will be asked to approve the half-cent sales tax increase to  fund highway improvements that we now know means the addition of new diamond  lanes. It will "only" cost me $75 a year. In June, 1990, I will be asked to  approve another half-cent sales tax increase to build new jails. Again, it will  "only" cost me $75 a year.  </P> <P> This is great coming from a Board of Supervisors that voted itself  (supervisors) a 25% salary increase.  </P> <P> One final thought: Why is it that politicians only know how to do two things --  raise taxes and raise their own salaries?  </P> <P> MARLENA BRICKNER  </P> <P> Cypress  </P></p>

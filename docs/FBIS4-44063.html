			<p>BFN     [Text] Corfu, Greece, June 24 (AFP) -- Russian President  Boris Yeltsin has sought and was refused endorsement of the  European Union [EU] for Russian mediation efforts in Georgia and  other regions of the Caucasus, a French official said here  Friday [24 June].    French presidential spokesman Jean Musitelli said Yeltsin  had  expressed disappointment at the refusal during a dinner he  attended with EU leaders here on Thursday ahead of a two-day EU  summit which started on Friday.    After the dinner, Yeltsin said he had also been grilled  about  Russia's involvement in negotiating a peaceful settlement to the  conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Musitelli said Russia was seeking recognition of the  Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) as a regional arm of  the United Nations which could launch peacekeeping activities  under a UN mandate.    Russian peacekeeping troops began deploying Friday in  Georgia's breakaway republic of Abkhazia, where ethnic  Abkhazians are seeking Russian support for their secessionist  ambitions.    Currently, the only European organisation able to authorise  peacekeeping activities is the pan-European Conference for  Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), which also includes  the United States and Canada.    Musitelli quoted French President Francois Mitterrand as  telling Yeltsin that Russia gave the impression of not always  welcoming CSCE intervention in the Russian "near-abroad" --  other countries of the former Soviet Union.    He also quoted Yeltsin as saying that Russian influence over  Serbia was limited. The EU leaders had pressed the Russian  president to increase pressure on Bosnian Serbs to accept a  settlement in the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Yeltsin said he remained "very involved" in efforts to  negotiate an end to the conflict, but warned that Russia's task  was complicated by links between Serb leaders and the Russian  opposition.    Musitelli quoted Yeltsin as telling European Commission  president Jacques Delors on Friday: "You tortured me for three  hours last night, but it was a salutary experience."</p>

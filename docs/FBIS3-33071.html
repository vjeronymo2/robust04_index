			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary; from the "National Newscast"] </F>   [Text] Andres Pastrana performed magic. In less than one  week he succeeded in reeling in Alvaro Gomez and doing away with  a long- standing split within the Conservative Party.  Everybody, except for the Alvarists candidates, is happy with  this. On one side, the Pastrana supporters are happy. With the  Conservative Party majority assured, Pastrana can devote his  attention to seeking the votes he needs and consolidate his  image as a national candidate.    The supporters of Liberal Party presidential candidate  Ernesto Samper are also claim to be happy because they say the  Gomez endorsement of the New Democratic Force shows Pastrana's  faithfulness to the old Conservative Party, something that  weakens his stance as an independent candidate. Pastrana  supporters respond by saying that what has been confirmed is  Pastrana's independence regarding his father, Misael.    For Andres Pastrana, the challenge is to gather Conservative  votes and endorsements before and during the party's convention  on 18 February and continue of appear as the young, independent,  and suprapartisan candidate.</p>

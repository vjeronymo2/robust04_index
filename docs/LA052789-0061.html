			<p><P> May 27, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'HOMELESSNESS IN SUBURBIA' AND SHEEN'S OFFER OF A SANCTUARY  </P> <P> Nowhere in Tom Pettepiece's first-person account on being homeless ("Homeless  in Suburbia: A Few Bad Turns, and You're Sleeping in Your Pickup," Editorial  Page, May 13) does he make mention of looking for work, any kind of work in  order to survive. Surely with "10 years of higher education," he didn't need  help in filling out a job application form and he was capable of doing more  than sponging off his friends and whining. A trip to the local Employment  Development Department office might have solved all of his problems.  </P> <P> TERRENCE BEASOR  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Reports by some news media on the strike at the  Bilibino nuclear power station (Magadan Region, Russian Far  East) and on stoppage of nuclear reactors there are wrong,  Interfax was told by a spokesman for the state concern  "Rosenergoatom", which is responsible for operation of Russian  nuclear power stations.    The concern admits, however, that a difficult situation has  shaped up at the Bilibino station. It is caused by the delay in  payment of wages to the personnel since December last year. In  one of its reports to the concern, the nuclear station's leaders  say that the families of many specialists are on the brink of  starvation.    The spokesman said, however, that the station continues  operating as usual and strikes at nuclear power engineering  industry are banned by Russian law.    The concern will hand over 500 Mn rubles Tuesday to the  station workers. However, the sum is only enough to pay wages  for December. The spokesman said that at all Russian nuclear  power stations the wages have not been paid since January.    The Bilibino station is a station of local importance and  supplies energy for the Bilibino-Chaunskiy mining center.</p>

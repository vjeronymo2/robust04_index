			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A MISTAKE? NOT REALLY!  </P> <P> In the interesting article "Weaving Through Scot Isle" (Travel Section, May  20), Beverly Beyer and Ed Rabey state: "Whiskey is spelled this way in Britain,  and it always means Scotch."  </P> <P> They are only half right. It is true that whisky always means Scotch in  Britain, but it is always spelled whisky. Never whiskey.  </P> <P> PETER HUME  </P> <P> El Toro  </P> <P>  Editor's Note: According to the Los Angeles Times Style Book, when referring  to Scotch or Canadian liquors, the word is spelled with an "e", as in whiskey  or whiskeys.  </P></p>

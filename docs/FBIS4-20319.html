			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by People's Armed Police Correspondents Jiang </F> Zishen (5261 3947), Liu Lixian (0491 4539 3759), and Bie Qinglin  (0446 1987 2651): "Fine Showing of Special Police. On-Site  Sidelights on Special People's Armed Police Unit Military  Training Demonstration"]    [Text] This is a stirring scene. This is a never-to-be  forgotten moment.    On the morning of 19 September 1993, many leading comrades  drive cars to the Special Police Academy of the People's Armed  Police [PAP] to view a demonstration of PAP military training  results. On this occasion, the PAP, a sword that has been  hardened for the past 10 years, is undergoing rigorous  examination by the party and the people.  <H8>  I </H8>   At exactly 0900 hours, on command from PAP Chief-of-Staff Wu  Shuangzhan [0702 7175 2069], the military training demonstration  begins with the national flag raising ceremony. To the rousing  strains of "Sing in Praise of the Motherland," played by the PAP  band, a contingent of flag escorts in dress uniform and carrying  semi-automatic rifles closely accompanies three soldiers bearing  flags as they goosestep across the rostrum.    The Chinese people are renowned throughout the world as a  nation devoted to ceremony. A march-past, the firing of a gun  salute, and, the escorting of foreign guests are the three main  events making up the PAP salute to the troops and welcoming of  the guests. The PAP honor guard enters the grounds to the  stirring sound of the military band.    "Boom, boom..." Volley after volley of gunfire resounds,  directing the eyes of those present to the left front of the  exhibition grounds. Gun salute troops from the Eleventh Zhidui  [regiment] of the Beijing Zongdui [corps] have now begun the gun  salute. This unit was founded in 1984. Since the firing of its  first gun salute on 23 March of the same year during the visit  to China of Japanese Prime Minister Nakasone, it has  successfully completed the firing of 238 gun salutes to welcome  guests. Today, the gun salute troops are firing a 21-gun salute,  the highest welcoming ceremony for foreign guests, to welcome  the arrival of all the leaders. Within the short period of 1  minute 28 seconds, from the beginning to the end of the national  anthem, it unerringly fires 21 volleys, each volley being fired  simultaneously by four ceremonial guns.    As the thunderous sound reverberates across the land, a  powerful motorcycle cavalry spreads its wings and soars. At 0915  hours, the national guest escort appears on the exhibition  grounds amidst the roar of motorcycles. All that is visible is  imposing people's armed police driving white motorcycles to the  left and right as they escort the vehicles carrying the foreign  guests in a speedy entrance. During the nine years since the  founding of this People's Armed Police contingent, which  combines security and ceremonial escort functions into one, it  has safely escorted heads of state, government leaders, and  leaders of political parties in power from 152 nations in  outstanding completion of its escort duties.  <H8>  II </H8>   Volley after volley of rifle fire cracks. At 0929 hours, a  dramatic demonstration begins in which Model 81 automatic rifles  fire at targets on which Chinese characters face away from the  audience. First four sharpshooters from the Special Police  School, Wang Zhiwei, Mao Xiaodong, He Liming, and Hu Bo, came to  the field. "Pop, pop, pop." With each crisp rifle shot, the  words, "politically qualified, militarily accomplished, fine  work style, strict discipline, and strong support" pop into view  on the target in 20 large resplendent characters. These are  Chairman Jiang Zemin's main requirements for building the armed  forces.    The next item in the dramatic demonstration is on truncheon  and shield technique and boxing. These two subjects, which are  demonstrated by the Thirteenth Detachment of the Beijing  Headquarters Group and the People's Armed Police School, fully  show the solid basic skills of People's Armed Police military  training. The 20 basic fighting methods and the five offensive  and defensive actions that the truncheon and shield contingent,  made up of 216 men from the Thirteenth Detachment, demonstrates,  shows an attack that sweeps everything before it like a  hurricane, and a defense that is like a steel Great Wall. The  fisticuffs technique that the 60-man special police personnel  collectively demonstrate consists of very powerful battle-tested  fighting techniques that the Special Police School has absorbed  in the course of training from the essence of Chinese martial  arts and the fisticuffs of all countries. They blend offensive  and defensive techniques into a whole. Using their fists and  feet, the action is determined and lively.    A women's performance where no men are allowed. The  performance of the Women's Enemy-Capturing Contingent from the  Sichuan Headquarters attracts particular attention. In a  one-on-one performance of capturing an enemy, young soldier  Zhang Ying faces a club wielding young man who is half again as  tall as herself Using the fighting skills for making a capture  that she learned in regular training, with cunning, she manages  to knock the "villain" to the ground in less than three  maneuvers.    The firing of Model 81 automatic rifles to designated parts  of the human body brings the feelings of the spectators to a  high pitch. From a distance of 100 meters, Five sharpshooters  headed by Di Lin from the special police school aim at the  targets, awaiting a command from the commander.    "The villain is trying to fight back. Hit him in the  forearm."    "The villain is still fighting. Hit him in the chest."    "....."    With each command from the commander, the five sharpshooters  fire, each shot hitting the part of the body they are directed  to hit.    Firing of the machine gun in bursts is a tough part of the  contingent's training. Comrades from the military training and  research office of the Tianjin Group Command School devoted 3  years study to this problem finally solving it. On the  exhibition ground, two machinegunners fire at 15 steel plate  targets from a distance of 100 meters. The rifle fire goes  "bang, bang, bang,' and within 5 seconds all the targets are hit  in 30 places. Immediately, enthusiastic applause breaks out on  the exhibition ground. One leading comrade says, "It is not  easy. The light machine gun that squads use does not do a good  job, but the People's Armed Police troops are good shots!"    The light machine gun precision rapid firing that the Anhui  Headquarters Group shows opens the spectators' eyes even more.  Six people including school police officer Ding Jiatie, each  fire 100 rounds at a human chest target from 100 meters. After  the firing ends, the range officer presents the target for  examination to the leaders on the exhibition grounds.    "Target number 1 hit with 100 rounds."    "Target number 2 hit with 100 rounds."    ...    "Good shooting, good shooting."    "Beep." With the sound of its horn, a long distance bus  drives into a station. Four "criminals" mingle with the  passengers and board the bus. As soon as the bus starts to move,  the "criminals" suddenly fire their weapons to hijack the bus.  The lives and property of the passengers are in serious danger.    This is a tactical exercise conducted against a backdrop of  real warfare. When our people's armed police detachment  patrolling the highway discovers what the "criminals" have done,  at once they notify headquarters via walkie-talkie. Immediately,  a truck bearing local government license plates, and two Model  130 trucks appeared behind the bus. The officers and men of a  Special Police combat company were under orders to remain in the  vehicle as they began to subdue the "criminals" and rescue the  hostages.    The hijacked bus speeds along rapidly, our special police  unit personnel in hot pursuit. When the bus reaches a relatively  wide spot in the road, the lead truck suddenly overtakes it and  brakes suddenly across the road ahead of it. When the bus driver  instinctively brakes his vehicle, the two Model 130 trucks speed  to the right sight of the bus. The special police detachment  personnel leap from under the canvas top, smash some windows in  the bus, and rush inside, capturing alive all four of the  "criminals" as swiftly as a thunder clap that leaves no time for  covering one's ears. All the hostages are released with no  injury to any of our special police detachment personnel. No  sooner does this intense battle end than the curtain opens on a  battle to rescue hostages from a residential area .    Seven "criminals" who had stolen a large sum of money,  rifles  and ammunition hijack a white van, which they are using to flee  helter-skelter. Along the way, the van breaks down. To prevent  the police from capturing them, the "criminals" place obstacles  in the road including the van and lane separators, and set fire  to them. Then, they flee to a residential apartment where they  seized several people as hostages in the hope of being able to  escape. As soon as our special police detachment receives the  report, it immediately organizes four combat teams, which  approach the apartments separately. Our riot prevention  personnel fire a tear gas shell from within the riot prevention  armored personnel carrier. The tear gas shell explodes in the  room where the "criminals" are hiding, and white smoke gushes  forth at once. Our combat team personnel, some of them following  the downspout and others using rope, scale the building like  geckos, leap into the room, and pin the "criminals" in a corner  with firepower, seizing four of them alive. Another two  "criminals" flee the building in an effort to escape. Our  assault team personnel immediately set loose two watchdogs,  which bring the "two criminals" to the ground in the twinkling  of an eye.    A roar of motors as the iron cavalry soars. The skilled  motorcycle driving of the Guangdong Police Headquarters brings  the exhibition to a high pitch. Six people's armed police headed  by Gao Xueping, drive their iron cavalry motorcycles at high  speed across a single plank and soar across a 1.5 meter high  platform.    "Next is flying across a short bridge. The bridge is 3.5  meters high, 3 meters wide, and 7 meters long. This simulates  obstacles that might be set up in search and destroy combat..."  After hearing the announcer's briefing, the leading comrades on  the rostrum put their binoculars to their eyes to watch this  daring performance.    "Varoom, varoom." As the detachment members open the  throttle, the motorcycles issues an ear-splitting noise. Then,  six motorcycles fly toward the cut off bridge at lightening  speed. The instant their front wheel hit the cut off bridge,  they zoom into the air in an arc, then land safely on another  cut off bridge 7 meters distant. Whew! They are like tigers  vaulting a ravine or like a rainbow arching through the sky. The  leading comrades on the rostrum are overwhelmed by the  exceptional skills of the soldiers. They put down their  binoculars and applaud warmly.</p>

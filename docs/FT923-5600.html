			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / International Company News: UBS bucks trend with optimistic outlook UNION Bank of Switzerland, the country's largest commercial bank, said its consolidated net profit in the first half reached SFr682m (Dollars 550m) and the prospects for the second half were 'fundamentally positive'. This was the first time UBS has published a consolidated interim statement, and no comparative figure was given. However, the group said earlier this month its profits had 'developed positively' in the first half. In 1991, the group recorded a net profit of SFr1.22bn. UBS's optimism contrasts with warnings from the two other large Swiss banks, Swiss Bank Corporation and Credit Suisse, of a deteriorating economic climate and a likely need for higher than expected loan loss provisions. The bank said trading and service activities were likely to pick up, although the outlook for loan business appeared less favourable. The group said gross revenue in the first half grew 7 per cent to SFr4.1bn. Cash flow reached SFr1.5bn, but provisions and write-offs amounted to SFr809m. No comparative figure was given, but in the full year 1991, these amounted to SFr1.7bn. Total consolidated assets as at June 30 were up 3.8 per cent to SFr258.8bn. Loans to customers rose 2.9 per cent to SFr142.5bn and customer deposits advanced 4 per cent to SFr159.8bn. Balances due to banks dropped 3.6 per cent to SFr51.8bn while those due from banks rose less than 1 per cent to SFr62.2bn. The group's securities portfolio grew 11 per cent to SFr30.5bn. Capital and reserves stood at SFr18.1bn, which provides a tier one ratio under the Basle international guidelines of 7 per cent.</p>

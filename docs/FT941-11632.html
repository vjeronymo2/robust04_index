			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Euro Disney Euro Disney's first-quarter results offer few rays of sunshine for shareholders. The theme park's net loss climbed to FFr553m. And although Euro Disney has chopped costs, price-cutting has not yet pulled enough visitors through the Magic Kingdom's doors to prevent revenues falling 12 per cent. The auditors' report commissioned by lending banks seems unlikely to apportion any blame. So lenders will have to devise their own approach to dealing with Euro Disney's FFr20bn of debt. Some banks have already lost patience and are selling well below par. The growing restiveness among holders of Euro Disney's FFr4bn convertible bonds creates another complication. Only the suspension of disbelief appears to be sustaining Euro Disney's shares. If Walt Disney's posturing is to be believed, there remains a threat that France's 'cultural Chernobyl' could melt down. At best, shareholders can expect massive dilution. The mooted FFr5bn rights issue would probably require a doubling of the shares in issue. A debt-for-equity swap would further dilute the shares. The slender hope is that the banks will knock down any longer-term benefits accruing to Walt Disney through royalties and management fees. That may leave sufficient recovery appeal for shareholders to take up their rights. Alternatively, the banks may choose to underwrite an unattractive rights issue to swap their debt into shares.</p>

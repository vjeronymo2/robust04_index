In this way, the Chinese leader's daughter stressed  that her father Deng Xiaoping is still in good health. In the  interview, Deng Rong disclosed that CPC General Secretary Jiang  Zemin and Premier Li Peng have often called on her father to  seek his advice on major issues. Deng Rong is in Japan to  commemorate the publication of Japanese edition of her book:  My Father, Deng Xiaoping.    Explaining her father's daily life, she said he does not  skip  his daily three-km walk and he still strengthens his body at the  age of 90. In the interview, she said, "His regular life appears  to be a key to his long life." Commenting on television news  reports in February showing her father's blurred eyes, Deng Rong  said: "My father's eyes were blurred by camera flashes. My  father's eyes are so good that he can read 10 pages of newspaper  every morning."    In the interview, Deng Rong said: "Her father sees the  reversion of Hong Kong to China as an end to the humiliating  chapter in Chinese history and as a great issue on which he  himself was involved in negotiations." She went on to say: "My  father wants to visit Hong Kong by car and stand on its soil  even for a minute. This is what my father desires the most."    In another interview that day, Deng Rong touched on the  Tiananmen incident in June 1989 and said: "Now, China is  entering an era of political stability and economic development,  and I believe that my father does not repent for his handling of  the incident," adding that the comment represents "her personal  view." On Mr. Deng's advice to General Secretary Jiang Zemin,  Deng Rong said, "My personal view is that when my father is  asked to make a judgment on options, he always adds something."  In this way, she stressed that her father stays away from the  affairs of state.</p>

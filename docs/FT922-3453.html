			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Survey of US Finance and Investment (9): Steady stream of smaller deals - Mergers and Acquisitions TAKEOVER ACTIVITY in the US is sharply lower than in the boom days of the late-1980s, and has changed substantially in character, with relatively few blockbuster deals but a steady stream of much smaller acquisitions and disposals. In 1991, deals worth Dollars 116.7bn were completed in the US, down sharply from the Dollars 169.4bn of 1990 and the Dollars 263.8bn record reached in 1988. The main reason for the drop is the much less favourable financing climate. Junk bonds, the main weapon used to fund bids in the 1980s, have fallen from grace, while the problems of the banking sector mean that borrowing from this quarter to fund takeovers is not very easy. The corporate raiders - financiers backed by junk bonds - who made much of the running during the takeover boom are now largely discredited, while recession has made many corporations concentrate more on the efficient running of their existing operations than indulge in takeovers. Some large takeovers are still being done, but they tend to have particular characteristics: They are agreed, rather than unfriendly. There has not been a large hostile bid in the US for almost a year. They tend to be within a sector, rather than across sectoral boundaries, and have a strong industrial logic. They are particularly concentrated in three sectors going through major restructuring - banking, defence and telecommunications. They tend to involve more equity, relative to debt, than deals done in the 1980s, and many of them involve pure swaps of shares in one company for those of another. A recent example is the proposed takeover of Centel, a large Chicago-based local telecommunications company by Sprint, a long-distance carrier, which involves a highly controversial share exchange pitched well below what many analysts think the company is worth. The bid activity is largely domestic. It involves relatively few large US bids for foreign companies and only the occasional foreign bid in the US. British, French and Japanese companies were extremely active in the US takeover market in the late 1980s and the French remained so right up until last year. But now this has slowed to a trickle as their domestic economies have turned down and, in the case of Japan, as they have seen many disappointing results from acquired US operations. However, there remains a reasonably lively takeover market in relatively small companies - both within the US and across national boundaries. While the value of US deals dropped 31 per cent last year, the number fell by only 19 per cent and at 3,268 was well above the 2,752 recorded in 1988, when the value of bids peaked. Many companies, moreover, now seem more interested in entering joint ventures, or acquiring a minority stake in a business, than taking on the risks of a full bid straight away.  ---------------------------------         US MERGERS AND          ACQUISITIONS  --------------------------------- Year    Deals        Value       completed   (Dollars bn) 1985    1,659       143.55 1986    2,345       209.31 1987    2,307       181.78 1988    2,752       263.78 1989    3,460       256.86 1990    4,040       169.39 1991    3,268       116.74  --------------------------------- Source: Securities Data Company  ---------------------------------</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Sokhbet Mamedov: "Azerbaijan's Foreign Trade Is </F> Taken Under State Control"]    [Text] Baku--The president of Azerbaijan has issued an  edict on tightening control over the foreign trade activity of  the republic's enterprises and organizations. This is a forced  measure, a number of economists believe, and has been brought  about by the fact that more than 90 percent of the republic's  enterprises engaged in foreign trade transactions are  endeavoring to keep the monetary resources they have earned  outside of Azerbaijan. Last year Azerbaijan exported $750  million of commodities overseas. Of this sum, more than $600  million have not as yet entered the republic.    A similar trend is being observed in commercial transactions  with the republics of the "near abroad," Russia included. For  example, according to figures of the State Committee for  Statistics, in nine months of the current year R116 billion of  commodities were exported to Russia and just R62 billion of  goods were imported. The arrears of more distant foreign  countries are substantial. Such states as Iran, Turkey, and  Greece owe Azerbaijan over $60 billion.</p>

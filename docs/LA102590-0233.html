			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> Consultants -- A new rule approved by the Pasadena Board of Directors on  environmental impact reports for proposed developments was reported incorrectly  Sunday. Rather than having developers choose consultants from a city list, the  new rule requires the city to contract directly with the consultants, with the  developer reimbursing the city.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by A.A.: "Price Increases: Grumbling in Union </F> Circles"]    [Text] Anger is brewing in union circles in  reaction to the recent increases in the price of widely used  consumer products. Expressing its surprise, the UGTA [General  Union of Algerian Workers] Executive Board is threatening to  take action.    In the fourth and last point made in a statement released  yesterday, UGTA Secretary-General Benhamouda did not mince  words: "The UGTA will use all the means in its possession,  undertake all legal actions, and take all steps it considers  necessary to defend the rights and interests of the workers and  their families."    His rather harsh statement notes with "surprise" that "the  recent increases...have plunged the workers and the public into  confusion and worry, all the more since they were  announced...just after the national secretariat's meeting with  the head of the government," a meeting at which the national  secretariat expressed "the union organization's opposition to  the preceding decisions to raise the price of certain products,  notably diesel oil, the negative consequences of which are  inevitable in many sectors of the economy, especially  transportation and agriculture."    Asserting that it "was not informed at any time or in any  way  of the successive increases ordered by the government, much less  involved in them," the UGTA questions "the real timeliness and  significance of the price-raising measures announced the day  after the demonstration that was held on 22 March 1994 to  protest terrorism and violence and demand the defense of  Algeria, whose unity and existence are being threatened by  forces hostile to our people."    The anger of the union officials is also expressed by the  UGTA's National Federation of Public Works and Hydraulics  (FNBTPH), which a few days ago held a meeting enlarged to  include officials of the union councils in firms in that sector.  The communique adopted at the conclusion of that open meeting  expresses "surprise" and "calls on the government to reverse its  decisions, which do not serve the interests of the country or  the citizens."    The measures that have been adopted are not the only ones  being challenged. Union officials also question the way in which  the government went about adopting and announcing them. The  UGTA's top official expresses surprise that the measures were  announced immediately after the central union's "informal"  meeting with the government while also pointing out very clearly  that the UGTA had nothing to do with the decisions that were  reached.    In other words, and this is the meaning of the message, the  UGTA did not back the increases, as the timing of the  announcement might lead one to think. For its part, the FNBTPH  remarks ironically that public opinion was informed not through  official channels but through "our respectable television."</p>

During a visit  to the Federal Border Guard in the Warnemuende District of  Rostock today, the minister said contacts between the border  authorities of both countries could be improved. Therefore, he  is proposing an exchange of liaison officers. He also called on  border guards to improve their knowledge of each other's  language.    Kanther said Germany will also be providing more equipment  to  the Polish police and border security bodies. It is clear that  the matter of border protection on Germany's eastern border  demands that all the parties involved accustom thsemselves to  the new situation, he said. [passage omitted]</p>

The SPNS program, authorized by section 2618(a) of the Public Health Service Act, receives its appropriation of funds through Public Law 103&hyph;112. Project periods can be from three to five years, subject to Congressional reauthorization in FY 1996 of the Ryan White CARE Act. This announcement solicits two types of applications: (1) HIV service delivery model demonstration projects, or (2) HIV service delivery model demonstration projects in conjunction with an evaluation and dissemination center. The SPNS program, in collaboration with the evaluation and dissemination center(s), will sponsor multi-site program evaluation studies. All HIV service delivery model demonstration projects agree, as a condition of grant award, to participate in these studies. Awards will be made to achieve population and geographic diversity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The SPNS program is designed to demonstrate and evaluate innovative and potentially replicable HIV service delivery models. The authorizing legislation specifies three SPNS program objectives: (1) To support the development of innovative models of HIV care; (2) to evaluate the effectiveness of innovative program designs; and (3) to promote replication of effective models. Therefore, crucial factors in appraising proposals for the HIV service delivery model demonstration projects will include the applicant's plan for conducting an evaluation of the model, the program's potential to improve access to, coordination of, and quality of, HIV service delivery, and a plan for disseminating findings about the model's effectiveness. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because of the complexity of this program, a cooperative agreement mechanism is being utilized to allow for substantial Federal programmatic participation in the conduct of the program, and to facilitate communication and coordination in the overall implementation and evaluation of the program. A steering committee will be established to facilitate coordination and cooperation among the service demonstration projects and the evaluation and dissemination center(s), and to oversee the cooperative agreements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Applications for these announced cooperative agreements must be received in the Grants Management Office by the close of business July 20, 1994, to be considered for competition.

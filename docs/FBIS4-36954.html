			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ahmad al-Yamani] </F>   [Text] Al-'Aqabah -- While preparations were under way to  celebrate the anniversary of the Great Arab Revolt, led by  al-Sharif Husayn I of Mecca, a large number of U.S. rapid  intervention forces of aggression were present in the port city  of al-'Aqabah and the al-Jafr area for their usual annual  exercises and training on fighting us in the desert, sea, and  air.    These forces had earlier participated in the 30-state  aggression against Iraq and attacked our trucks and oil tankers,  burning them and killing their occupants--our sons--while  driving along the road in Jordan.    Allowing the U.S. forces of aggression to pursue training on  fighting us or resting and recreating in Jordan requires all the  national forces and their representatives in the House of  Representatives to firmly prevent this provocation and stop  these exercises, which are due to last one month.</p>

			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Tay Homes upbeat despite fall to Pounds 3m TAY HOMES, the Leeds-based housebuilder, underscored its upbeat trading statement by announcing plans for another two operating areas despite reporting a fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 4.85m to Pounds 3.09m for the year to June 30. 'It is now accepted by almost all commentators that the housebuilding industry is slowly emerging from its worst period in recent history,' said Mr Trevor Spencer, chairman. He added that the company expected 'considerable improvements' in the north of England and Scotland. The group had decided to open new operating areas in north-west Birmingham and north Bristol. A maintained final dividend of 4.65p is proposed, giving a same-again total of 5.85p, payable from earnings of 9.5p (13.6p) per share. Profits were depressed by the adoption of more conservative accounting policies recommended by the company's auditors. They relate to the sale of properties to business expansion schemes, to which the company has given guarantees on future returns, and to the sale and leaseback of an office building. Without the policy changes pre-tax profits would have been Pounds 3.9m (Pounds 6.1m). Turnover fell to Pounds 69.7m (Pounds 72.4m), although the company increased unit sales to 1,107 (1,030). 'We sold a record number of houses last year which was greatly helped by the surge in demand during the early months of 1993. 'This followed the worst autumn sales period in the company's history, an experience shared with many housebuilders, which impacted on both selling prices and margins,' Mr Spencer said. The company now has a bank of 4,200 plots (4,000) excluding 750 plots on two sites in Scotland. Interest charges fell to Pounds 2.17m (Pounds 3.11m). Gearing was cut to 36 per cent (48 per cent) on borrowings of Pounds 10.9m (Pounds 13.5m) although these had been higher during the year.</p>

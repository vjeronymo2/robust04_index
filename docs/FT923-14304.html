			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Rifkind urges EFA'rethink' GERMANY was urged to reconsider its decision to withdraw from the consortium that commissioned the European fighter aircraft (EFA) and back attempts to 'drive down the costs of the existing design' by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, in the Commons yesterday. He strongly underlined the economic case against embarking on a new project which he put to Mr Volker Ruhe, the German defence minister, in London on Monday. Mr Rifkind warned that the acceptance of Germany's view would result in the taxpayers of all the countries concerned - Spain and Italy are the other members of the consortium - losing any benefit from the substantial sums already invested. Last night, Spain indicated its full support for Britain's determination to press ahead with the project. A senior defence ministry official said also that Spain would welcome new partners. Mr Menzies Campbell, Liberal Democrats' defence spokesman, called for an assurance that savings would not be made at the expense of the aircraft's 'inherent capability'. Mr Rifkind said 'substantial cost savings' had already been identified, and emphasised that Britain wished to continue, as part of an effective partnership, towards the production phase of the project. Embarking on a smaller version of the EFA as proposed by Mr Ruhe would involve redesign of the airframe and engine, delaying the aircraft's entry into service by up to eight years. While not disputing the legal right of Germany to withdraw from the production phase, he pointed out that it was committed to investing a further Pounds 1bn in the development phase. Mr Martin O'Neill, the shadow defence secretary, underlined the extent to which the future of Britain's aerospace industry was dependent on the revenue raised from the EFA project.</p>

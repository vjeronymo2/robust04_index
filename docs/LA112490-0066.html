			<p><P> November 24, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SCR'S COMMITMENT TO ARTISTIC FREEDOM UNQUESTIONABLE  </P> <P> Last week, articles in The Times Orange County Edition ("SCR Rejects Offer to  Join Panel" by Zan Dubin and "Will No One Represent O.C. at State Arts Forum?"  by Randy Lewis, Calendar, Nov. 16) may have led some people to question South  Coast Repertory's commitment to the cause of freedom of expression.  </P> <P> These stories had to do with SCR's declining an invitation to join a panel at  the California Confederation of Arts statewide meeting -- an invitation issued  verbally on short notice and outside normal channels. Once we understood the  nature and importance of the CCA's invitation, David Emmes agreed to appear on  the panel.  </P> <P> Columnist Lewis used this regrettable but honest breakdown in communications as  an opportunity to call into doubt South Coast Repertory's commitment to fight  challenges to artistic freedom. To draw such a judgment on the basis of one  incident, while ignoring SCR's actions over time, is unfair.  </P> <P> There is no cause to doubt SCR's commitment. In this year of attacks on  government arts funding and a national campaign to weaken artistic freedom, SCR  has not retreated or compromised. In specific support of the National Endowment  for the Arts and artistic expression in general, we stuffed our theater  programs with a flyer urging our audiences to advocate an unrestricted  reauthorization of the NEA. Even after that action had threatened SCR's funding  from the city of Costa Mesa, we printed a second message reiterating our stand  and inserted that in our programs.  </P> <P> Martin Benson monitored meetings of the Costa Mesa City Council and voiced  strong opposition to proposed language for Costa Mesa grant applications (a  Times editorial favorably cited his testimony). SCR joined in an amicus brief  filed by Theatre Communications Group in support of current suits to strike  restrictive language from NEA grant applications. All our concerns regarding  threats to artistic expression have been communicated to our audiences through  the artistic directors' letter in our programs and in the pages of our  subscriber newsletter. One program essay, "Endowing the Nation's Spirit," was  part of the local NEA office's report to Chairman John E. Frohnmayer.  </P> <P> We have taken advantage of every media opportunity to speak in support of the  endowment and against censorship. Emmes was part of a public radio business  feature that ran nationally; SCR literary manager John Glore was a guest on  KABC Talkradio; Benson was interviewed for a CNN broadcast; and we were  interviewed by Newsweek and have been in numerous articles in the Register, The  Times, the Daily Pilot and others. For the Sept. 23 edition (of The Times),  Emmes wrote a column at the invitation of the editorial staff in which he  strongly supported an unrestricted NEA and defended the right of the Costa Mesa  Civic Playhouse, at a time when it was under fire, to produce "Sister Mary  Ignatius Explains It All for You."  </P> <P> Finally, the place where SCR has for 26 years supported freedom of expression  is on its stages. We have never shied away from confronting controversial  issues in the plays we have produced. We have received national recognition for  producing challenging plays that colleagues in some other major cities tell us  they wish they were able to present for their audiences.  </P> <P> We will continue to serve our audiences with theater that illuminates our  world, and we will continue to defend our right to present the artistic truth  as we see it.  </P> <P> DAVID EMMES  </P> <P> Producing Artistic Director  </P> <P> MARTIN BENSON  </P> <P> Artistic Director  </P> <P> South Coast Repertory  </P> <P> Costa Mesa  </P> <P> MORE LETTERS: F4  </P></p>

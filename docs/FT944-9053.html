			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Faster growth in pay signalled Signs emerged in September that pay growth is edging up, in spite of the annual growth rate of underlying average earnings remaining unchanged at 3.75 per cent. In the production sector underlying average earnings growth increased from 4.25 per cent in August to 4.5 per cent in September. Manufacturing earnings grew at 4.5 per cent in September, after August's rise had been revised up to 4.5 per cent from 4.25 per cent. The overall figures are being kept low by the services sector, where annual earnings growth was unchanged at 3.5 per cent in September. The services figure will be affected in October by the 4.5 per cent settlement for 750,000 local authority manual workers. Last year they received an increase of only 1.5 per cent. The underlying figures for average earnings smooth out the effects of factors such as pay arrears and industrial disputes. The seasonally adjusted growth in average earnings in the year to September was 3.8 per cent, down from 3.9 per cent in August. Mr Michael Portillo, employment secretary, said: 'Earnings growth is still some way above the inflation figure and this is an undesirable situation from the point of view of maximising employment growth.' In spite of the rise in manufacturing earnings, wages and salaries per unit of output were 1.4 per cent lower in the three months to September than in the same three months of last year. This was the biggest fall since records began in 1970. Figures for previous months have been revised down. The strong increase in output and the lack of growth in manufacturing employment has kept unit labour costs subdued. Manufacturing output per head was 6.0 per cent higher in the three months to September than in the same period last year.</p>

			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / American Steel Tariffs: Japanese fear protectionism may be on the rise in Washington - Tokyo may be more assertive in future THE preliminary ruling by the US that Japan and 18 other countries have been dumping steel products in the US triggered dismay and a flurry of protest yesterday from the Japanese authorities and the steel industry. Both the foreign ministry and the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti) promptly issued statements expressing deep regret at the rulings and called on the US authorities to make 'truly impartial judgments' in reaching their final ruling in April. Mr Hiroshi Saito, president of Nippon Steel, the world's largest steel company, and chairman of the Japan Iron and Steel Federation, said the Japanese steel industry had made serious efforts to ensure orderly trade with the US and would continue to press its claim that Japanese imports were not being dumped in the US and were not harming the US industry. The Japanese authorities and industry officials warned that the massive filing of anti-dumping and countervailing petitions could adversely affect the relationship between the Japanese and US steel industries and pose a serious obstacle to progress in agreeing rules for world steel trade through the Multilateral Steel Agreement negotiations. The steel ruling, in the wake of reports that the Big Three car makers are preparing to file dumping actions against imported cars and suggestions that the new administration of President Bill Clinton may revive the Super 301 provision of the US Trade Act, has fanned fears in Japan of growing US protectionism. Concerns about a protectionist administration in the US has already led to widespread public debate in Japan over what the country needs to do to defuse tension with the US. While publicly the authorities say it is too early to tell what trade policy the new US administration will adopt, recent official statements indicate that Japan may adopt a more assertive stance in putting its case forward in trade disputes with the US. Both Miti and the foreign ministry claimed yesterday that the problems of the US steel industry stem largely from domestic causes. 'It is. . . difficult for Japan to consider that Japanese steel products could have damaged the US steel industry at the time when the VRA (Voluntary Restraint Arrangement) was in place until the end of March last year,' the foreign ministry said. Japanese exports of steel to the US have been falling, and the uncertainty surrounding the anti-dumping petition by US steelmakers last summer has already stalled steel trade negotiations with the US, Japanese industry officials said. If the preliminary ruling and dumping margins of 15 to 27 per cent are upheld when the US makes its final ruling, Japan could see its steel exports to the US halved. The Japanese authorities make it clear that they intend to examine whether the US determinations on steel are consistent with the Gatt provisions, the implication being that if they are not, and if the final ruling by the US remains affirmative, Japan may refer the issue to Gatt. Earlier this week, Mr Sozaburo Okamatsu, director-general of Miti's international trade policy bureau, suggested that the revival of Super 301, which allows the US to impose sanctions on Japan unilaterally, could lead to retaliatory action by Japan in line with the Gatt regulations.</p>

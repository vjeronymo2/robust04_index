			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Midday Television Newscast"] </F>   [Text] The Colombian Government has reacted angrily to an  Amnesty International document that asks the United States to  suspend military aid to Colombia because of an alleged increase  in human rights violations.    The government today vigorously denied the Amnesty  International report, which asks the U.S. Government to suspend  or freeze military aid to Colombia because this aid is being  diverted to help repress and violate human rights. According to  Government Minister Fabio Villegas Ramirez, the international  organization is not only misinformed, but it has been acting in  an ill-intentioned and biased manner.    [Begin Villegas recording] There is true ill-will in  statements Amnesty International frequently issues on Colombia.  To ignore the efforts that Colombia has made in the area of  human rights, the strengthening of our institutions to face  these problems, and the fact that the 1991 reform of the  Constitution is based on this nation's desire to overcome its  human rights problems -- all of this goes beyond simple  misinformation on behalf of Amnesty International. It shows  bias in the organization's assessment of Colombia. [end  recording]    Although there is no legal recourse by which the government  can report these irregularities by Amnesty International to  another international organization, Colombia will continue its  policy of using evidence to prove that it is taking steps to  halt human rights violations.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Nicosia, April 11 (AFP) -- An adviser to President  Saddam Husayn has held talks in Moscow about Russia resuming  work on developing a giant oil field in southern Iraq, a  specialist newsletter reported here Monday.    'Adnan al-'Ani, an adviser with ministerial rank, led the  delegation to Moscow last week to discuss developing the West  al-Qurnah field when the UN embargo is lifted, the Middle East  Economic Survey (MEES) said.    The field close to the northern tip of the North al-Rumaylah  field will have an estimated output capacity of 600,000 barrels  per day after a second phase of work is completed, it added.    In an agreement signed in April 1984, the former Soviet  Union  was to develop the field under an engineering, supply, and  construction contract financed by a 2-billion dollar soft credit  facility.    Technoexport, a Soviet firm, was responsible for the first  phase with a production capacity of 200,000 bpd, according to  MEES published in Cyprus.    Much of the field's surface facilities have been built, but  Technoexport was behind schedule when Iraq in?nah field was  discovered by the Iraqi National Oil Company in 1973.    A UN embargo was imposed on Iraq when it invaded Kuwait and  the UN Security Council has set conditions for Iraq to meet in  order to have the embargo lifted.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brussels, ROMPRES, 26/1/1994 -- Following are  excerpts from the statement made by Romania's minister of state,  Minister of Foreign Affairs Teodor Melescanu at the ceremony of  signing the framework document of Partnership for Peace:    "Mr. Deputy Secretary General, Ladies and Gentlemen,    "It is a great pleasure for me to sign today, on behalf of  my  country, the framework document opening the way of the  implementation of the Partnership for Peace to Romania, which  happens to be the first country to put its signature on the  document. I hope it is a good omen for the future of our  relationship.    "As you are aware, Romania positively appreciated the  Partnership for Peace from the very beginning.    "If you were to ask why did we like the Partnership for  Peace, I would say that most and foremost for its fair, equal  and non-discriminatory approach.    "May I also stress that my country considers the Partnership  for Peace as a preliminary stage to Romania's future membership  to NATO's political and military structures. We also welcomed  the Partnership as a new form of cooperation between NATO and  the democratic states for the East of the alliance meant to  enhance security and stability in Europe.    "In joining the Partnership for Peace, we attach utmost  importance to the pledge of the alliance that it is committed to  the preservation of democratic societies of the partners, to  their freedom from coercion and intimidation, and the  maintenance of the principles of international law.    "I reaffirm here and now, on this solemn occasion, my  country's commitment to fulfill in good faith the obligations  incumbent upon it by the UN Charter, and the principles of the  Universal Declaration on Human Rights. We fully support the  call of the recent Brussels summit to refrain from the threat or  use of force against the territorial integrity or political  independence of any state, to respect existing borders and to  settle disputes by peaceful means. Romania remains deeply  committed to the Helsinki Final Act and all subsequent CSCE  documents, as well as to the obligations undertaken in the field  of disarmament and arms control.    "The political statements, particularly President Clinton's  statement, that NATO must address the concerns of those nations  that lie between Russia and West Europe, for the security of  those nations affects the security of America and the alliance  as a whole, and the security mechanism agreed upon in Brussels  represent to my country a major support and encouragement in its  endeavors to strengthen its stability and security at a moment  of turmoil in its vicinity, and, on a wider scale, a support for  the consolidation of the Romanian democratic society.    "By acceding today to the Partnership for Peace, Romania is  undertaking another major step in the implementation of its  fundamental political option of integration into Euro-Atlantic  structures -- a goal that enjoys the consensus of major  political parties and of the public opinion at large.    "We are delighted to return to the world where Romania has  always belonged. Our whole history, culture, traditions,  political institutions have always been linked -- except for the  Cold War time -- with the Western world. Integration into this  world in every possible way is but a natural option for Romania.    "We are deeply convinced that belonging to this world is the  sole guarantee and the strongest incentive for the successful  accomplishment of our national domestic targets of building a  democratic society, with a market economy and full respect of  human rights.    "Now that we joined the Partnership for Peace, we plan to  move ahead, and to move quickly.    "Romanian civil and military experts are already working on  the presentation document. In that respect, we have initiated  informal consultations with military experts from NATO countries.    "May I take the opportunity in order to invite a team of  NATO  experts to Bucharest to assist us in drafting the relevant  documents.    "A package of laws on the democratic reform of our armed  forces (civilian control, transparency, elaboration of the new  military doctrine) have been submitted for validation to the  Romanian parliament."</p>

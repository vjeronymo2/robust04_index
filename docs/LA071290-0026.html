			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> CLARIFYING POINT ON TORRANCE'S PAY ISSUE  </P> <P> The excellent reporting (Times, June 21) of the recommendation of the League of  Women Voters of Torrance for charter review included a quote from Councilman  Dan Walker -- "I don't want a raise. I don't want to ask for a raise.  </P> <P> You serve as an elected official because you like it." His statement is a  moving tribute to public service, but he misses our point.  </P> <P> The league is not supporting increased or decreased compensation for council  members. We support removing a specific figure of compensation from the  charter. Such mention is inappropriate and unrealistic.  </P> <P> The Torrance City Council deals with this issue by resolution. Council members  can receive more than $800 per month, of which only $250 is for reimbursable  expenses. The city charter states that compensation is $100 per month. The  league believes this discrepancy is misleading.  </P> <P> The charter is overdue for review by a broad-based citizen's committee. That is  our main recommendation to the Torrance City Council, based on several  obsolete, confusing and illegal sections of the charter. Councilman Walker's  comments frame the issue as one of council compensation. We feel this is too  narrow an interpretation of our recommendation.  </P> <P> LYNITTA SCHAFFER  </P> <P> President  </P> <P> League of Women Voters  </P> <P> of Torrance  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] With much talk of new fighting and another  government offensive in southern Sudan, the question is: Will  the divisions in the rebel SPLA [Sudanese People's Liberation  Army] give the government an easy time? The two rebel sides,  John Garang's wing and Riak Machar's breakaway faction,  SPLA-United, keep having talks only to go back to the bush and  start fighting each other again. They had another go at burying  the hatchet in Nairobi in early January. Well, Riak Machar is  currently in London and Robin White asked him what the state of  relations was now.    [Begin recording] [Machar] I think that relations are  improving.    [White] Has there been any fighting at all since that  meeting  in early January?    [Machar] Not that reported to me, no.    [White] So, what happens next?    [Machar] Well, we are hoping to have another meeting to work  out our relationship in terms of how we could cooperate at the  frontline.    [White] And when would that meeting be?    [Machar] I hope it will take place on 7 [February] if that  it  is going to be made possible by the Kenyans.    [White] That is this weekend?    [Machar] Yes.    [White] And you will meet face to face with John Garang?    [Machar] Yes, we have been meeting face to face.    [White] How do you get on when you meet each other?    [Machar] We talk.    [White] Do you argue?    [Machar] Naturally, we had differences and we had to argue  them out, yes.    [White] What are still the differences between you?    [Machar] The first difference, which we have now overcome,  is  the objective of the movement. Garang has accepted the right of  self-determination for the people of south Sudan. The other  outstanding issues are the issues on democracy and issues on  human rights.    [White] That was one of the initial reasons for you breaking  away and that you accused him of human rights abuses and of  being dictatorial. In fact, since then he has released a lot of  people from jail, so has he done most of what you asked him or  not?    [Machar] Well, he has released most of the people and many  others escaped and there are still others in jail. The three  Martins -- Martin Makul, Martin Majir, Martin Quigbera -- and  Kawaye Makwaye are still in jail.    [White] Where are they being held?    [Machar] I don't know.    [White] The objection that Garang seems to be having against  you of late is that he claims that you are not doing any  fighting against the Sudanese Army -- the Northern Sudanese Army  -- you are too busy fighting him. Is that true? Do you accept  that?    [Machar] He may be too busy fighting me, not the other way  round. I don't think that we are not fighting the Sudan  Government. First, look at the strategy of the Sudan Government.  The strategy of the Sudan Government today is to take control  of the borders, and the borders which they think are viable to  the SPLA are Uganda and Kenya, and the person who is at those  borders is John Garang forces. [as heard]    [White] Garang seems to think that you have some secret  deal with the Sudanese Government in which the Sudanese  Government will not attack you.    [Machar] Well, I don't think there is any secret deal  between  SPLA-United and the Sudan Government. If there is one let him  produce it.    [White] The signs are that there is a major offensive on the  way from the Khartoum Government, can you withstand this?    [Machar] Well, there is a major offensive. It will be the  12th major offensive since we started the war in 1983 and we  withstood the previous ones. I think, yes, we will withstand  this also.    [White] But might you not this time lose? Isn't the enemy --  your enemy -- getting stronger?    [Machar] By the way, even if the enemy takes over all the  towns which are under the SPLAs' -- both SPLA -- that is not the  end of the war. We will quickly revert to guerrilla tactics.    [White] Do you think the people of southern Sudan can stand  much more?    [Machar] They have been fighting nearly now for 40 years. It  is because they believe in the cause of the struggle. Yes, it  is true that there is a desperate humanitarian situation. But  they are not giving up the fight now.    [White] But are you quite sure that the people regard your  soldiers as friends?    [Machar] Our soldiers come from the people. They are  children of South Sudan. They have fathers, they have mothers,  they have families who are South Sudanese, so they are friends  of people of South Sudan.    [White] They are not the bringers of death and destruction?    [Machar] Not at all because if they were regarded as such  then the civil population would not contribute their children to  go and fight this war.    [White] Won't you accept that things have never sank so low,  things were never so bad as now in the southern Sudan?    [Machar] Every liberation movement has its ups and downs.  [end recording]    Well, it seems the government offensive in southern Sudan  is,  in fact, well underway, according to reports from neighboring  Uganda. From Kampala, our correspondent Eppajar Ojulu telexed  this report. [read by announcer]    According to travelers arriving from the northwestern Arua  region, the offensive started during the middle of last week.  The travelers included businessmen who usually frequent the  Uganda-Sudan border and they told me that during the past two  days, loud explosions coming from inside Sudan have been heard  from Uganda's side of the border. They said the explosions  sounded like long-range heavy artillery pounding suspected rebel  positions. I have been informed by usually reliable sources  that Colonel John Garang's SPLA faction was the main target of  the dry season offensive, which is concentrating on the  rebel-occupied areas in the Eastern Equatoria and Western  Equatoria Provinces.    The sources said that thousands of troops supported by  artillery were advancing southwards towards the Uganda border on  one front and the Kenyan border on the other. The objective of  the offensive is to cut off Garang's forces from their main  supply routes suspected to be in Uganda and Kenya. The  offensive has become the subject of discussion among the people  in Arua, who are yet again beginning to see a new influx of  refugees. One businessman, who claims he sometimes goes deep  inside the rebel-controlled area, said that the shelling was  being done randomly by the government troops. He claimed that  three days ago, one of the shells had landed on a church and  smashed it.</p>

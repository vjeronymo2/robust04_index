			<p>BFN     [Text] Tianjin, March 25 (XINHUA) -- The real estate  industry has become a prime investment field in north China's  Tianjin city.    Statistics show that foreign investment in the real estate  sector amounted to 233 million U.S. dollars in contractual  volume in the first two months of the year.    Overseas investment concentrated on such fields as  renovation  or removal of dilapidated housing and building of hotels,  villas, entertainment facilities and commercial buildings.    Experts here observed that the real estate investment trend  started last year. They say that cheaper land prices than in  Beijing and Shanghai, a lack of high-level hotels and a  convenient transportation system are contributing to this  investment fever.    According to officials, a large number of old houses within  the city proper are still waiting to be razed to make way for  construction of a five-star Shangri-La Hotel.    A heavy industrial center in northern China, Tianjin is  about  two hours from Beijing. It is also an important seaport in  northern China. The city's population totals over nine million.</p>

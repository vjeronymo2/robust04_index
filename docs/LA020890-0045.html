			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> ROYAL CLINCHES SHARE OF LEAGUE TITLE, 55-52  </P> <P> Royal High used clutch baskets from Chad Smith and Jared Byrne to cap a wild  fourth quarter that featured five lead changes and hand host Westlake a 55-52  loss in a battle for the Marmonte League title Wednesday.  </P> <P> The win gave Royal (20-5, 9-2), which trailed by 11 points early in the third  quarter, at least a share of its first league title since 1971.  </P> <P> Westlake (13-9, 7-4), in the hunt for its first league title, fell to third  place behind Simi Valley (16-8, 8-3).  </P> <P> Simi Valley, which defeated Thousand Oaks, 63-56, will travel to Royal on  Friday in the final game of the regular season. Simi Valley must win to forge a  tie and give the Pioneers a share of their fifth consecutive title.  </P> <P> Smith, a 6-foot-5 senior who was hampered by foul trouble, hit a 15-foot jump  shot to give Royal a 53-52 lead with two minutes left. After Westlake's B. J.  Sena (15 points) blocked a shot and gave the Warriors possession with 19  seconds left, Byrne immediately stole the ball underneath Westlake's basket and  scored to give Royal a 55-52 lead with 17 seconds left.  </P> <P> Westlake called a timeout with 15 seconds left to set up a game-tying basket,  but Dave Monheim's three-point attempt twice bounced from the rim with four  seconds left.

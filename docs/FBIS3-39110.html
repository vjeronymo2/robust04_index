He meets his Canadian counterpart Andre Ouellet on Monday  and  will propose ways to strengthen trade links between South Korea  and NAFTA, including the establishment of "special cooperative  relations," officials said.    They are to discuss post-Uruguay Round bilateral trade  arrangements and regional cooperation through the Asia-Pacific  Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, the officials said.    Han meets Secretary of Commerce Roy MacLaren first and is  expected to urge Canada to extend its general preferential  tariff (GPT) status for South Korea that ends in June, as well  as lower import and other trade barriers to South Korean  products.    He will call on Prime Minister Jean Chretien on Tuesday  before going to the United Nations, where he plans to confer  with Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali on the North Korean  nuclear problem and possible measures by the UN Security Council.</p>

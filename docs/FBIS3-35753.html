			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Grigoriy Arslanov, Vyacheslav </F> Tomilin, and Georgiy Shmelev]    [Text] Beijing January 28 TASS -- Russian Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev wrapped up the Beijing part of his visit to China  with meetings with Chinese leaders in Zhongnanhai, where the  country's central party and government bodies are located.    "China values its cooperation and good relations with  Russia,  which were reached at a dear price, and desires that the peoples  of the two countries live in harmony from generation to  generation", announced Chairman of the Chinese People's Republic  Jiang Zemin at his meeting with Kozyrev.    The Chinese leader mentioned the high value of Russian  President Boris Yeltsin's visit to China in December 1992, and  expressed his satisfaction with the stable development of  Russian-Chinese relations, saying they were based on mutual  respect, equality, and mutual benefit. "The maintenance and  expansion of such relations is one of China's permanent  policies", Jiang said.    Concerning the trade and economic aspect of Russian-Chinese  relations, Premier of the Chinese State Council Li Peng remarked  on the great potential for business cooperation between the two  countries.    The volume of trade between Russia and China reached 7.6  million U.S. dollars in 1993. This, however, is only four per  cent of China's overall import-export turnover. In connection  with this, Li called for "joint searches for new ways of  cooperating", adding that the Russian and Chinese economies are  in many way mutually complementary.    The two sides called for their bilateral relations to be  raised to a new, qualitatively higher level. Kozyrev said that,  as far as economics goes, relations of constructive cooperation  imply a transition to implementing long-range joint projects and  other "higher and more stable forms of cooperation".    The Russian foreign minister gave Jiang Zemin a personal  letter from Boris Yeltsin with an invitation to pay an official  visit to Russia. The earlier-communicated invitation to Li Peng  was confirmed and, in his turn, Li invited head of the Russian  Government Viktor Chernomyrdin to visit Beijing. Chernomyrdin's  upcoming visit to China, along with Chinese Foreign Minister  Qian Qichen's expected visit to Moscow, will set the stage for  the second Russian-Chinese summit meeting, scheduled to be held  in Moscow in the third quarter of this year.    Kozyrev held a press conferrence in Zhingnznhai after his  meetings, at which he emphasized the two sides' efforts to  develop a cooperative relationship which is of a "strategic,  long-range nature, not subject to vacillations".    Answering journalists' repeated questions about  Russian-Chinese military cooperation, Kozyrev said he has never  hidden the help which the two sides have given each other, this  was at least demonstrated by the presence of Russian Deputy  Defence Minister General Gromov. "This cooperation is being  developed within the framework of friendly relations and overall  partnership", he declared.    Later on Friday, Kozyrev, accompanied by Russian regional,  district and business leaders, arrived in the "special" free  economic zone of Shenzhen in the south of China. The goal of  his trip was to become acquainted with this "Chinese laboratory  of modern managment", the foreign minister said.    Thanks to economic reforms and its ability to attract  foreign  investments, Shenzhen has turned into one of the country's  largest industrial centres. This experiment is of interest not  only for the far eastern regions of Russia, but for the  north-west as well. At the same time, Kozyrev stressed, "Russia  is not going to copy the experience of any one country. We are  only going to take it into account when conducting our own  economic reforms".    Tomorrow is the last day of Kozyrev's visit to China, when  he  will stop over in the ancient Chinese capital of Xian.  Afterwards he will return to Russia.</p>

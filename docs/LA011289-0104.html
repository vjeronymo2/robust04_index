			<p><P> January 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIET JEWS VISITING ISRAEL  </P> <P> As many as 10,000 Soviet Jews were allowed to visit relatives in Israel last  year in a wave inspired by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of  more openness, it was reported Wednesday.  </P> <P> Arrivals began last spring and "in 1988 we figure there were between 8,000 and  10,000 who visited," said Rabbi Richard Hirsch, executive director of the World  Union for Progressive Judaism, a private lobby.  </P> <P> He said that even more Soviet Jews could visit this year. "We consider this a  harbinger of better times," said Hirsch.  </P> <P> The Soviets, many of whom travel on tickets paid for by kin in Israel, have  tourist visas and stay as long as three months.  </P></p>

			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / Thatcher attacks Major's stance on EC union MR JOHN MAJOR last night faced fresh criticism from Lady Thatcher over Britain's economy and its approach to Europe as he prepared to underline his personal commitment to the Maastricht treaty on European union. In another thinly veiled attack on her successor, the former prime minister said Mr Major's determination to hold sterling's value against the D-Mark in the European exchange rate mechanism was prolonging the British recession. In a phrase recalling her battles over exchange rate policy with her former chancellor Mr Nigel Lawson (now Lord Lawson), she added: 'If by artificially controlling the exchange rates between countries you try to buck the market, you will soon find the market bucks you - and hard.' Her remarks - delivered in a speech in South Korea - came as the Foreign Office signalled that Mr Major would reaffirm his strong support for Maastricht in an important speech on Monday when he opens the flagship conference of Britain's EC presidency. Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, the Foreign Office minister responsible for Europe, said Mr Major remained convinced that Maastricht was 'good for Britain and good for Europe'. Mr Major plans to devote most of his speech to setting out his vision of a wider, liberal and outward-looking Europe, but Mr Garel-Jones said the prime minister would 'undoubtedly re-emphasise' his firm commitment to Maastricht. Speaking at the launch of the conference, Mr Garel-Jones said the UK expected the French electorate to vote Yes in the September 20 referendum. 'I do not anticipate the collapse of the Maastricht treaty. I do not anticipate anything but a Yes vote.' But he acknowledged also that in its role as EC president, the UK was drawing up contingency plans in the event of the treaty's rejection by France. Among the starting points were the commitment to maintain sterling within the ERM, and an assumption that the intergovernmental co-operation on foreign and defence policies enshrined in Maastricht would proceed without a formal treaty. Whitehall officials said the plans included an emergency meeting of EC foreign ministers in New York on the day after the referendum. The ministers, who will be attending the United Nations general assembly, could then decide to call for an emergency summit of EC leaders. Lady Thatcher's intervention provided a further reminder to Mr Major that, whatever the French result, his party's Euro-sceptics plan a concentrated campaign to prevent ratification of the treaty by the British parliament. In a speech which also included a number of transparent sideswipes against rising public spending and borrowing by Mr Major's government, Lady Thatcher drew parallels with the disintegration of the former Yugoslavia and warned that attempts to create artificial federations fuelled nationalism and risked conflict.</p>

			<p><P> January 3, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIRM SAYS IT WAS A 'STRAW MAN' IN LINCOLN DEAL;  </P> <P> S&amp;LS: A BUSINESSMAN SAYS HE SIGNED DOCUMENTS FOR A $14-MILLION LAND DEAL  MERELY AS A FAVOR FOR A FRIEND.  </P> <P> An Arizona businessman testified in a federal court Tuesday that his small real  estate investment company was a "straw man" in a $14-million land transaction  involving Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan.  </P> <P> Fernando Acosta, who was president of Westcontinental Mortgage &amp; Investment  in Tucson, said his limited partnership was too small to buy the property and  that he simply signed documents without reading them to help his friend,  Lincoln borrower Ernest C. Garcia.  </P> <P> Acosta's testimony prompted U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin to question the  safety and soundness of the loans that Westcon received.  </P> <P> Acosta was the third witness to testify for the government in a hearing to test  the evidence that federal regulators used to justify the April 14 takeover of  Irvine-based Lincoln.  </P> <P> Sporkin is taking testimony on four transactions that regulators claim typify  the failure of Lincoln's parent, American Continental Corp. in Phoenix, to  operate the S&amp;L safely and soundly and conserve assets. He expects to hear  from American Continental executives, including its controversial chairman,  Charles H. Keating Jr., during the next three days.  </P> <P> American Continental claims that regulators lacked sufficient evidence to show  that Lincoln was operating unsafely and unsoundly and was substantially  dissipating assets. American Continental had filed for bankruptcy protection  the day before Lincoln was seized.  </P> <P> The collapse of Lincoln could become the nation's single biggest thrift  failure, with taxpayers forced to pay more than $2 billion to bail out the  S&amp;L.  </P> <P> The government's case before Sporkin was jolted Friday when regulators learned  that Garcia, the key witness in the Westcon transaction and another deal, would  exercise his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and refuse to  testify in the civil proceeding.  </P> <P> But James P. Murphy and Paul E. Gutermann, lawyers for the Office of Thrift  Supervision, said they still expect to show that regulators had sufficient  information to seize Lincoln. They expect to use Garcia's deposition last March  in a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation of American Continental  to bolster their case.  </P> <P> That deposition, along with a Westcon letter admitting that the firm held the  property as a straw owner, provided regulators with the "smoking gun" they were  looking for to seal their rationale for seizing Lincoln, according to the  testimony of Kevin T. O'Connell, an executive at OTS, the nation's thrift  regulatory agency.  </P> <P> But John C. Luntin, a Phoenix attorney for American Continental, said the  documents were not the smoking gun and, in fact, showed that the Westcon deal  was not a sham transaction, as O'Connell claimed.  </P> <P> Regulators claim that developer Garcia needed a loan to buy back an 80%  interest in his firm that he had previously sold, but Lincoln would supply the  money only if he bought a vacant parcel in a master-planned community southwest  of Phoenix.  </P> <P> Garcia did not want to buy the property but arranged for Westcon to buy it on  March 30, 1987. And he loaned Westcon the $3.5-million down payment from  Lincoln funds he received, regulators claim.  </P> <P> Acosta said he agreed to be a "nominee" as an "accommodation" to his friend,  who wanted the property off the books of E. C. Garcia &amp; Co. Acosta said no  payments were expected because the property was supposed to go back to Garcia  within 90 days, but it wasn't until more than a year later that Westcon was  able to get Garcia to take it back.  </P> <P> Acosta testified that he never read the documents he signed, never knew who  owned the property, never learned what the documents were and never knew that  he even had received $3.5 million from Garcia and transferred it at the same  time to Lincoln as a down payment. The judge was concerned that Lincoln would  make a $10.5-million loan for the balance of the purchase price to Westcon,  which couldn't pay it back. "It might be considered to be unsafe or unsound,"  he said.  </P> <P> Luntin, however, said after the court hearing that Lincoln didn't lend Westcon  any money. The S&amp;L received $3.5 million in cash as a down payment and  simply took a promissory note back for the remainder.  </P> <P> The down payment, he said, came from Garcia's own pocket. Of the $20.2 million  loaned to Garcia to purchase his company's stock, $19.6 million was wired  directly to the seller, and the rest went to Lincoln as loan fees.  </P></p>

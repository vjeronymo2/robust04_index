			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Today at the Quirinale [president's office],  [Silvio] Berlusconi, the Forza Italia leader, met with President  Scalfaro for the first time. Scalfaro also met with Italian  Republican Party [PRI] secretary [Giorgio] La Malfa.    Berlusconi told journalists that while his movement was  viable on its own, out of necessity it was obliged to enter into  alliances with other parties: i.e. [Umberto] Bossi [Northern  League], [Gianfranco] Fini [National Alliance-Italian Social  Movement], and the former Christian Democrats of the Christian  Democratic Center Party.    [Begin Berlusconi recording] Obviously, certain alliances  can  result in lost votes. We hope that voters understand, and we  hope to be able to explain to them that it was in the higher  interest of the nation that we entered into these alliances,  along with the need to add to certain lists [of candidates] the  names of the leaders and protagonists of some movements with  which we are allied. [sentence as heard]. [end recording]</p>

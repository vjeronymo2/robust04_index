			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Mitigation and Monitoring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many commenters stated that the proposed mitigation measures were inadequate. Many were concerned that aerial surveys would be unsuccessful in detecting marine mammals because they spend 90 percent of the time submerged.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NMFS believes the mitigation measures required by the rule are adequate to protect marine mammals and reduce incidental take to the lowest level practicable. While aerial surveys will have difficulty detecting those marine mammal species that spend a significant portion of the time submerged, the regulations prohibit detonations if even a single marine mammal (or sea turtle, sea bird flock or fish school) is sighted within the safety zone by aerial survey. The small take authorization is for the unintentional take of marine mammals not sighted by aerial survey. Refer to the EA for a detailed discussion on how the small take estimates were made.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Some commenters suggested additional (or alternative) methods for detecting marine mammals during surveys, especially for deep-diving species, such as sonobuoys and hydrophone arrays. One commenter also suggested, if possible, using sound to cause some species to surface so they can be seen or to leave or avoid the test area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although the Navy proposes to employ hydrophone arrays at several locations to record the impulse pressure wave resulting from the ship shock trial, these hydrophones will not be capable of recording marine mammal vocalizations. Also, because the shock trial is a mobile exercise, and because it would be necessary to triangulate on vocalizing marine mammals in order to determine whether or not they are within the vicinity of the shock trial, this suggestion is not viewed as being practicable at this time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The practicality of using ``scare charges'' (smaller explosive charges) or high decibel noise devices in order to scare marine mammals from the area of testing is equivocal at best. There is insufficient evidence to give assurance that marine mammals would leave the area and not be attracted to the site.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter considered the 2-nm safety zone to be inadequate, believing that injury or harassment could occur at distances greater than 2 nm. The commenter also considered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Area 1'' and ``Area 2'' to be artificial and anthropocentric. Other commenters were concerned that the effects could extend to great distances, for example physical harassment could occur 22,000 ft (6,706 m) from the detonation and acoustic harassment up to 121,000 ft (37,039 m) for a 10,000-lb (4,536 kg) charge. One commenter was concerned that these distances would cause an impact very close to the nearest islands.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NMFS considers the 2-nm safety zone to be adequate to protect marine mammals from injury and death. As indicated in the EA (Table 12) for the 10,000-lb (4,536 kg) charge, the 2-nm (i.e., 12,150-ft (3,704 m)) safety zone is greater than the calculated limit for minimum eardrum injury (9,400 ft (2,865 m)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As noted in Table 12, while physical harassment could occur up to 22,000 ft (4.2 nm) from the detonation, as indicated in the application, the safety zone exceeds the maximum horizontal ranges for physical harassment for mammals at the shallow depths; however, for mammals at depths greater than 200 ft (67 m), there is a possibility for physical harassment beyond the safety zones, since the surface reflected relief wave arrives later at these depths for these ranges. Refer to the application for a detailed description of sound source levels in the marine environment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Arts: Two 'Mayerling's - Ballet The tragic circumstances surrounding the revival of Mayerling at Covent Garden inevitably make us more conscious of this ballet's merits. In 1978, freed from time-consuming duties as Director of the Royal Ballet, Kenneth MacMillan celebrated his release with a work of larger scale and deeper concerns than ever before. Seven years earlier, the full-length Anastasia looked at the collapse of the Romanov dynasty through the eyes of the young Grand Duchess, and focussed upon the matter of identity. In Mayerling we are shown a corruption of the Archduke Rudolf's identity that helped destroy the Hapsburg empire. And in doing this MacMillan brought off an astonishing feat, by surrounding his central characterisation - the most densely wrought and detailed male role created in this century's dance - with a series of female portraits no less psychologically apt. For MacMillan, Rudolf's womanising is a key to his tragedy, sprung from his tormented relationship with his mother, exemplified by his brutality to his wife, and illuminated by his ambiguous relationship with Larisch, a mistress/procuress who is the only woman to comprehend his suffering. That she is the agent to bring Mary Vetsera to him is the final, fatal touch to their liaison. The fantasies central to Rudolf's psyche - love in death; sado-masochistic passion - find their terrible reality at Mayerling. Yet detailed as these female characters seem, they never over-balance the ballet's central concern with Rudolf. We see how complex was the social and emotional fabric of the tragedy, and how superbly MacMillan has given its theatrical essence. In the Royal Ballet performances this season, as in the past, we also see the grand sensitivity of the troupe to the roles he gave them. Most of the artists are making debuts, but the style and the power of playing by the entire troupe is magnificent. In Thursday's revival, Irek Mukhamedov was a Rudolf of entire truth. He understands the central anguish of the character, and he has mastered the physical outlines and the searing movement that must tell of that anguish. The reading was dark, tight in focus, everywhere convincing, and some slight embellishments of steps are the choreographer's tribute to Mukhamedov's technique. From Viviana Durante an excellently judged Mary, conveying the sensuality just below the surface of social manners, and from Lesley Collier a perfect Larisch - worldly, watchful, and suddenly and touchingly gripped by her passion for Rudolf. Jane Burn, a young dancer new to us, was Stephanie, Rudolf's hapless bride. Her reading was delicate, urgently stated, if understandably careful as yet, but Sir Kenneth admired her abilities and she will grow with further performance. On Saturday afternoon, another new cast was headed by Michael Nunn's Rudolf. Nunn - fine in The Judas Tree as the innocent young man - gave a performance which combined physical elegance (beautiful line; lucid gesture) with an ideal sensitivity. He played the crucial 'closet scene' with the Empress Elizabeth superbly: kneeling, with her hands pressed to his head, he said everything about the Rudolf who would behave with such frenzy as he goes to his bride. A nervous impetuosity informs this reading - rightly so - and it augurs brave things for the future. In Gillian Revie, Nunn found a sensually vivid Mary: the dance was luscious, emotion exactly judged between sexual opportunism and fantasy. There was also a notably good Larisch from Genesia Rosato, and a completely understood Stephanie from Natalie McCann - showing us every nuance of incomprehension, distaste, and more than a hint of stuffiness. Company performance was excellent: I admired Matthew Hart's buoyant, musical account of Bratfisch, and Anthony Bourne's sensitivity in the same role; and also the bravura view of Mitzi Caspar from both Darcey Bussell and Leanne Benjamin. In Mayerling (as in so much of the MacMillan repertory) the Royal Ballet is seen as an ensemble of expressive dancers without peer. It is a message worth proclaiming. Mayerling continues in repertory at Covent Garden.</p>

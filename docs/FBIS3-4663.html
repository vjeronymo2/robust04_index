[passage omitted]    "We strongly deny that the Khmer Rouge recaptured the base.  The news...is exaggerated," Cambodian military spokesman  General Nhean Manou said. "The Khmer Rouge have shelled us every  day with 300 to 400 rounds since February 19 and we have  withdrawn some men from the frontlines at Anlung Veng," he said.  But another military official, speaking on condition of  anonymity, said government troops were under heavy pressure and  were forced to withdraw to positions up to 10 kilometers (six  miles) to the south and west of the base. The 10-kilometer line  is the position where the government troops launched their  offensive last August.    Western diplomats said they could not confirm that the Khmer  Rouge had taken the base but said it was possible as it was  difficult for the government to send supplies to the men  stationed in the remote and inhospitable area.</p>

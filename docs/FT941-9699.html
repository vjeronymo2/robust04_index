			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Editor resigns as Le Monde falls into the red Mr Jacques Lesourne yesterday resigned as managing editor of Le Monde, the influential French daily newspaper, after a long-running row over the paper's gloomy financial prospects and its future strategy, writes Alice Rawsthorn from Paris. Le Monde, like the rest of the French press, has recently come under intense financial pressure because of the economic recession and the instability caused by the recent reform of the advertising space buying system. Mr Lesourne, who was elected managing editor for five years in 1991, had been trying to cut costs at the paper. However he announced last week that Le Monde had fallen into the red in 1993 after mustering a negligible profit of FFr1.3m (Pounds 149,000) in 1992.</p>

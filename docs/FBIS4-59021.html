			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Nehama Dowek: "Who Will Occupy Ramon's Chair?"] </F>   [Text] Even before the Labor party has had sufficient time  to recover from the divorce papers sent by Ramon, the boat is  being rocked by a new storm, which is another ramification of  the original move. Hayim Ramon's move did more than threaten  the Labor's hegemony in the Histadrut; it left a vacant space at  the top, a space that has to be filled, a space that causes  great apprehension in the party. All triggers have been  released, and some people are standing with live grenades in  hand, waiting for the next move before deciding where they  should be hurled.    As cabinet member, Ramon represented the party young  generation's hunger for privileges and for a role in the making  of momentous decisions. Ramon, who was 42 when he was first  appointed minister, was the white hope of the young guard, for  whom he was a model to be emulated. Now his place at the big  table is vacant. The young party members are convinced that one  of them should occupy it. The middle generation members believe  it is time one of theirs joined the leading team. And Rabin?  Apparently he has made no commitment to anyone. He listens to  everyone, nods his head, and does whatever he pleases.    The prime minister's bureau has been a scene of pilgrimage  in  the past two weeks. 'Uzi Bar'am, Nisim Zvili, Avrum [Avraham]  Burg, and Hagay Merom all met with him at their request. The  list may have been longer. They all spoke of the need to  appoint a young Labor minister. Rumor has it that Zvili  actually prodded Rabin. Failure to appoint a member of the young  guard at once would be a mistake, he said. With Zvili as the  initiator, the move needs to be thoroughly examined. Seasoned  politicians explain that such a move will create facts on the  ground, barring Ramon from returning to the government after the  Histadrut [Labor Federation] elections. The occupied seat will  signal to Ramon something along the lines of the famous adage  that "graveyards are filled with people who thought they were  indispensable...."    Rabin listened and nodded. The conversation, we are told,  proceeded as follows:    Zvili: "If you are asking me, you should act quickly and get  someone from the Ramon bunch into the government."    Rabin: "Who?" Zvili: "There is no shortage of candidates:  Beilin, Burg, Merom. You have two vacant seats." Rabin: "Is  that your suggestion?" Zvili: "Yes, it is."    Bar'am had a similar suggestion. Rabin remained uncommitted.  In any event, he said, it is irrelevant until after the  Histadrut elections.    Burg and Merom apparently asked to be placed at the  forefront  of the group vying for the vacated slot. Burg, who is working  around the clock for the Histadrut election campaign in  Jerusalem -- he heads their public relations -- this week  released a statement to the press proposing to stay off the  issue, because this is not the right time. However, at the end  of the statement he mentions -- supposedly by the way -- that  when they do get to discussing the issue, they should remember  the results of the primaries. Explanation for the uninitiated:  In the primaries, Avrum Burg made the third slot, right after  Rabin and Peres. When Rabin was composing his cabinet, Burg  considered himself a natural candidate for ministerial  appointment. Rabin had a different opinion. Burg should mellow  a bit, grow up a bit, he said. Burg, a Peres man who has never  received real promotion from him, was offended, but continued  running. Now he thinks it is time the IOU was paid.    Burg will be impeded by his recent announcement that he was  competing for the job of the Jewish Agency chairman. He made  frequent statements about how important and interesting the job  was. Now he says: "Being a minister is still more interesting  in these critical times. If I have to choose between the two, I  would prefer to be minister. Yes, I believe the primaries  results are consequential. If they decide to appoint Edri, they  will find me there [not further specified]."    The key of coalition appointments stipulates one minister  per  three Knesset members [MK's]. The faction had 44 MK's and rated  15 ministers. Now, after Ramon's "secession," it rates only 14  ministers. But even now, it is two ministers short. Rabin  still holds five portfolios: prime minister, defense, interior,  religious affairs, and health. He is reserving the religious  affairs and interior for SHAS [Torah Observing Sephardim].  Defense is run by him and by Mordekhay Gur. That leaves him  with the health portfolio, although another appointment is  possible, particularly in view of the fact that some ministers  have two portfolios. There is an opinion that since Rabin does  not feel obligated to anyone, he may appoint an outside  professional, thereby closing the affair.    If he does that, there will be backlash from party members.  Justifiably, they are looking for appointments. Five MK's feel  they deserve it, some more, some less: Yosi Beilin, Avrum Burg,  Hagay Merom, Rafi Edri, and Efrayim Sne.    Beilin, the deputy foreign minister who has been doing an  excellent job, does not like being presented as a candidate. He  is happy, and he is not even certain that Peres will fight for  him now, in view of the recent tension between them. On the  other hand, he will not decline a ministerial appointment, if  offered one. Even if it is the health portfolio. His  appointment will depend on Peres. Rumors have it that Rabin does  not like him, but he thinks very highly of him and is not ruling  out his candidacy altogether. "No one has told me anything, and  I do not think it is relevant at the moment," Beilin says.    Peres' position on the case of Burg is equally unclear.  Peres is today a solitary cabinet minister, the sole member of  his own camp, after Shahal, whose appointment Peres had warmly  encouraged, has long ago wandered off in the direction of Rabin.  As for Burg, it is being said that Peres had provided him with  a springboard, but the moment his back was turned, Peres  snatched away the pool.    Hagay Merom, a member of Kibbutz Yif'at which belongs to the  United Kibbutzim Movement [UKM], once fought for a ministerial  appointment, but Rabin preferred Tzur, although the latter had  not been elected to the Knesset. Merom was offended, and a  short while later, he attacked Rabin from the Knesset podium,  calling on him to restrain the functionaries at the Prime  Minister's Office. The prevailing opinion is that Rabin does  not trust him, and in addition, he has no reason to appoint  another UKM member.    Merom: "I do not take the various statements about me  seriously, and I have no claims on a place around the cabinet  table. I like it in the Knesset, and I like it in a situation  where I am free to voice my views -- even when they are against  the government -- without the constraints of ministerial  responsibility. But, I appreciate my colleagues' thinking I  should be minister."    Efrayim Sne, too, was once a Peres man. However, he quit  at the last minute of the struggle between Peres and Rabin. I  think Rabin is more suitable, he said then. Peres does neither  forgive nor forget. Whenever Sne's name is mentioned for a  possible government position -- and it has been mentioned for a  variety of jobs -- Peres vetoes it. Perhaps this time Rabin  will persist. Sne's training as a doctor could be to his credit  when the candidate for the job of health minister is considered.  Speculations are that given the choice between Beilin, Burg,  Merom, and Sne Rabin will choose the latter. Incidentally, Sne  met Peres last week and asked him to withdraw his opposition to  his inclusion in the government, either as a deputy minister or  as a minister. Peres replied: "Why should you be appointed  before Beilin or Burg?" Peres had a similar reply about Rafi  Edri's candidacy.    Edri, a minister without portfolio in the unity government,  walks around with a promise in his pocket from Rabin to appoint  him as a minister. The promise was given to him before Ramon  dropped his bombshell, when Edri finessed the resumption of  relations with SHAS. Rabin had then planned to ask the Labor  Central Committee to approve the return to the government of  Ramon -- who resigned due to the party convention's resolutions  -- along with the appointment of Edri as minister without  portfolio. The double deal was meant to soften the blow for  those who feel that the younger generation is not sufficiently  represented.    Now, everything has changed. Rabin may not be able to make  good on his promise to Edri, which some term "a solid promise  that holds more than water." The problem could be solved if the  prime minister had the guts to make the move he ought to make:  "rid" the government of David Liba'i and Shim'on Shetrit, two  law professors who get on his nerves. Then he would have three  or four vacancies, which would enable him to appoint a few young  men as ministers and be seen as a leader grooming Labor's next  generation, as Begin and Shamir did in the Likud. However,  Rabin is not built that way. He would rather leave people in  the lurch and make them leave of their own volition. The point  is, however, that Liba'i and Shetrit have no plans to go.    Under certain circumstances one might consider the  possibility of Ramon himself returning to the government.  However, such a scenario may only be examined after the  Histadrut elections, and only if Ramon fails to head the largest  faction. According to one scenario, under such conditions Ramon  would transfer his votes to Labor in exchange for a seat around  the government able. This will create a problem. Ramon was  expelled from Labor, and if he is appointed minister he will no  longer be able to run in the Knesset elections. People will say  he already got his reward. On this point, Labor is holding him  by the throat. Ramon's friends claim that he will return to  Labor only through the front door; that is, if he wins the  Histadrut elections and is appointed its secretary general.  Then, however, Ramon will stay as secretary general and there  will be a vacant seat around the government table.    Zvili: "The issue is not on the agenda. Everything will be  dealt with after the Histadrut elections and SHAS' return to the  coalition. I did not make any recommendations to the prime  minister as to whom he should appoint. That is his call. I  told him that as soon as he makes up his mind I will help him  get his decision approved by all the party institutions."    Meanwhile, the expected appointments have become the hottest  topic of conversation in the Knesset cafeteria. Everybody is  stirring the pot, appointing, and making doomsday predictions.  And what about Rabin? He is tensely awaiting the results of  the Histadrut elections. He has put all the ingredients in the  pot, and it remains to be seen whether Ramon will spoil his  broth.</p>

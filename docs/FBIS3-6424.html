			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Panmunjom, March 16 (YONHAP) -- Inter-Korean  dialogue resumed on the Northern side of the truce village of  Panmunjom Wednesday amid a chilly atmosphere after a North  Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman, in a statement a day earlier,  said Pyongyang would neither accept further nuclear inspections  nor talks with the United States if a South-North envoy exchange  was a prerequisite.    The North's chief representative, Pak Yong-su, skipped his  usual lengthy small talk and instead got right down to business  with his South Korean counterpart, Song Yong-tae, just five  minutes after exchanging greetings.    He also snapped at Song when the latter humorously reminded  him that seven was a lucky number -- referring to the seventh  round of inter-Korean contacts to discuss exchanging special  envoys -- barking, "That's what foreigners say and what is so  special about numbers?"    -- As usual, the two negotiators greeted one another with  talk about the weather.    "They say it's going to rain today. We call spring rain,  medicine rain... But our experts forecast it's going to be dry  this year," Pak said.    Song, keeping the conversation rolling, asked Pak what he  had  done over the weekend. He then brought up traditional  wrestling, noting that the sport in the North was quite  different from in the South, based on what he had seen in a  recent televised match monitored here.    "We have many wrestlers weighing above 100 kilograms, but  you  seemed to have fewer grapplers above 90 kg and we do it on sand  while you do it on a mat," Song observed, tactfully hinting at a  friendly wrestling match. Pak ignored Song's request, saying  wrestling methods differ.    Song then touched on Seoul's concern for health and the  environment, to which Pak cynically replied that he had read  that water and other kinds of pollution were a serious problem  in the South.    -- North Korean reporters showed the greatest interest in  the  South's response to Tuesday's statement by a Foreign Ministry  spokesman who warned that there would be no Pyongyang-Washington  high-level talks or inter-Korean exchange of envoys if South  Korea and the United States continued to be unreasonable.    They asked what U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robert  Gallucci, chief negotiator at the high-level talks with  Pyongyang, and Undersecretary of Defense Frank Wisner were doing  in Seoul and whether Washington still maintained that it would  not resume high- level talks with North Korea unless the envoys  are exchanged.</p>

			<p><P> December 13, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 'TELL' TO BE DISMANTLED; PRESERVATION STILL UNCERTAIN  </P> <P> "The Tell" is due to be dismantled and removed from its site along Laguna  Canyon Road by Jan. 15. Project co-organizer Mark Chamberlain wants to see  parts of the giant photomural preserved and has written to a number of  institutions, but so far he has raised no interest.  </P> <P> Composed of tens of thousands of donated family snapshots glued to a plywood  structure more than 600 feet long, the mural was created to symbolize  opposition to development of the largely pristine canyon. The work was the  centerpiece of a protest walk Nov. 11 that drew a crowd estimated at more than  7,000. (The protests apparently have been heard: The Irvine Co. has agreed to  consider relocating the huge Laguna Laurel housing and commercial project that  it had planned for the canyon).  </P> <P> "The Tell" originally was scheduled to come down in September, but city  officials have allowed it to remain until insurance on it runs out. Chamberlain  and volunteers will begin dismantling it Jan. 6.  </P> <P> Chamberlain said he would like to see portions of the mural acquired by a  museum "so that if there's any heritage in this piece, it will be preserved."  Nancy Coop of the Laguna Art Museum confirmed that the museum had received such  a proposal from Chamberlain but has no plans to comply.  </P> <P> Chamberlain has proposed cutting some parts of the mural into small sections  and selling them to "recoup some of the expenses" of building it and to benefit  groups working to preserve Laguna Canyon.  </P> <P> "There's this guy in Texas who offered to buy the Berlin Wall" and resell it in  sections, Chamberlain noted.  </P></p>

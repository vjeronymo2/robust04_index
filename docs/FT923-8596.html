			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / Personal View: Spine for the jellyfish Perhaps the most delicate task facing Mr John Major during the British presidency of the European Community is to find a way of putting backbone into what the Financial Times has described as the 'intellectual jellyfish' of subsidiarity. On the other big issues - enlargement, the budget, Gatt, etc - the outstanding problems are well understood. Subsidiarity, by contrast, is more like a mysterious marine creature washed up on the beach after a storm. The stakes are high. Success will help reconcile the Danes to the Maastricht process, which must be done before they assume the presidency on January 1. It will also do more than anything achieved by Mr Major's predecessors to set the Community on a course with which the British people feel at ease. Declarations to the effect that decisions should be taken at the lowest appropriate level and in the most accountable fashion raise more questions than they answer. Going to the opposite extreme of drawing up lists of which functions the Commission should maintain and which it should hand back to national governments will likewise lead to endless argument. What is needed is a guiding principle, and for this we cannot do better than look to Switzerland. As the most enduring confederation in the world, it has much to teach the rest of Europe. In particular the preamble to its constitution explicitly states that one of the purposes of that constitution is to guarantee the continued existence of the cantons. This goes to the heart of the matter. Throughout the Community there is a widespread feeling that the process of integration is running out of control and trampling on national characteristics and sensibilities. In Germany this manifests itself in the defence of the D-Mark, in France in hostility to allowing foreigners to vote in elections and in Ireland in the concern over abortion. The determination 'to lay the foundations of an ever closer union among the peoples of Europe', expressed in the preamble to the Treaty of Rome, lies at the heart of the Community. But people also want to maintain their own institutions and ways of doing things. If the peoples of Europe are to continue with the work of construction enjoined by the Treaty of Rome, they must feel that it is complementary to what they are trying to do at the national level and adds to it, rather than replaces it. Europe must be seen to enhance the scope and capacity of the member states, not as a threat to them. The best way to achieve this is to ensure that the Community constitution - the Treaty of Rome as amended at Maastricht - places the burden of proof on those who want powers exercised from the centre. A preamble, protocol or declaration needs to be drawn up stating that the purpose of European union is to enhance the ability of national governments and parliaments to fulfil the will of their peoples. That, in turn, would require that a case would always have to be made to show that the states will be better off as a result of the centre gaining powers and responsibility. This would be so whether these powers are at the expense of the states or new ones - in relation, say, to the environment - which the states cannot adequately discharge on an individual basis. It will still be difficult to decide what should be done at national or Community level. But there will also be a clear yardstick against which proposals are assessed in the Council of Ministers and the agreements reached there are then put to the peoples of the member states. In most countries, Maastricht and the negotiations leading up to it represented a classic case of ministers and officials taking decisions without reference to their electorates. That is why second thoughts developed so quickly in Germany and France, reinforced by the Danish referendum. It is neither possible nor desirable for the European Community to adopt the Swiss practice of holding referenda on important or controversial decisions. But unless national parliaments can find ways of legitimising the actions taken by national ministers in Brussels and the agreements reached there, the Community will continue to be seen as a rival to national institutions rather than their ally. At present, governments are far less accountable for the decisions they take jointly in a Community context than for those they take singly within the framework of their own national laws and customs. Small wonder that when important issues are at stake, the legitimacy of those decisions should be questioned.

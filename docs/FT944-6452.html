			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Survey of Bristol (2): Symbol of a resurgence - Bristol as a financial centre Stand high on Brandon Hill, near the centre of Bristol, and look south over the impressive city panorama. This city, the successful, thriving business capital of Britain's south west in the 1980s, has since suffered a painful recession and the decline of many of its traditional industries. Down below Brandon Hill, however, is what many Bristol people believe is a symbol of a resurgence in the city's fortunes; Bristol's 'jewel in the crown'. It is large and spectacular, sitting squat on the waterfront at the heart of the city's docks - the headquarters of Lloyds Bank's UK retail banking operations. Lloyds' decision to move its retail operations to the city - where it now employs about 1,500 staff - in September 1991 is seen by many as the final seal of approval of Bristol as a leading financial centre. It is on this role that Bristol people are pinning their hopes for the city's future. 'Bristol has suffered from a severe recession and from its switch from an engineering and merchant-type background to a more service-orientated economy,' says Mr John Burke, chief executive of the Bristol &amp; West, Britain's eleventh-largest building society, which has Bristol as its home. 'But there are now positive signs of recovery and there is a growing realisation that its attractions now make Bristol second only to London as a financial centre.' Bristol &amp; West employs about 3,800 staff, 1,000 of them in Bristol, and has a network of about 170 branches, 64 of which are in the south-west region. The fact that many leading national and international companies have chosen to locate in Bristol over the past few years - Lloyds Bank and the Bristol &amp; West are not alone in choosing Bristol as a home - is testament to the qualities the city has to offer as a financial centre. The insurance industry, in particular life insurance, is strongly represented here. The most significant insurance start-up in the past few years - National Westminster Life - chose Bristol as its base; and the UK's most successful direct marketing company, Direct Line, is shortly to open an important new operation in the city. According to a recent report on financial services in the west of England, by accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand, about 55,000 people in the Bristol area are now employed in the financial services sector. If the professions that provide support for that sector - accountancy and the law - are included, the number rises to 67,000. The insurance industry accounts for about 51 per cent of this total, the report finds. Banking and finance, another important sector, accounts for 22 per cent - the Bristol bank Tyndall, Lloyds' and Coutts' private banking operations and the merchant bank Singer &amp; Friedlander can all be found within the city. Building societies account for 22 per cent; venture capital and other smaller sectors account for the remainder. The local Chartered Institute of Bankers has no fewer than 1,484 members. The report finds that the total assets controlled by financial services organisations headquartered in the west of England, with Bristol as its capital, is now in excess of Pounds 190bn. The qualities that have drawn these companies to the west and to Bristol in particular are numerous. Mr Michael Edwards, deputy managing director of the Insurance Service - the direct insurance arm of Royal Insurance - lists most of them: 'We chose to set up business here because of the good quality and largely underemployed workforce, the exceptionally good road, rail and air links, the pleasant environment and the excellent support services such as PR, marketing, design and print,' he said. 'The people here are fairly lively and optimistic,' he adds. The Insurance Service, housed in the futuristic blue Spectrum building, near the city centre, has been based in Bristol since its start-up in 1987 and now employs 500 people. The direct insurance sector, which first began in 1985, was hardly touched by the recession, says Mr Edwards. By the end of last year it had a 20 per cent market share of the UK motor insurance market. 'It is great for Bristol to have growing industries such as ours here,' he said. Add to Mr Edwards' list the strong links that exist between business and Bristol's two universities and business school, and the large supply of skilled graduate labour these provide and it is easy to understand why companies are attracted to the city. 'Bristol is an international magnet for the insurance industry and for finance,' said Mr Edwards.</p>

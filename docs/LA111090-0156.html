			<p><P> November 10, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> PROPOSAL TO DOUBLE MEDFLY TRAPS PUT OFF  </P> <P> In response to objections raised by Supervisor Roger R. Stanton, Orange County  agricultural officials have agreed to delay a proposal that would double the  number of Medfly traps in the county.  </P> <P> The proposal, which involves approving a "plant pest prevention contract" with  the state, was to have been considered by the Board of Supervisors at its  Tuesday meeting.  </P> <P> Late Friday, however, Stanton circulated a letter to his colleagues registering  his strong opposition to the contract.  </P> <P> "The item which is before us today is not a mandated program . . . but a  discretionary 'pilot program' which would double the number of Medfly trap  sites from approximately 1,500 to 3,000," Stanton said in his letter. "It is  logical to assume that an increase in trap sites would also increase the  probability of trapping another Medfly and again subjecting the citizens of  Orange County to repeated aerial sprayings of malathion."  </P></p>

			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Thorn EMI THORN EMI wishes to point out that the high average remuneration to its directors of Pounds 850,000 shown in the accounts to March 31 1992, as reported in last Thursday's Financial Times, is substantially skewed by the remuneration of the head of its US music division, who receives Pounds 3.8m. The UK average is Pounds 221,000.</p>

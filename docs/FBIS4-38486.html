			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Vladimir Alisov (ADS) report under the "Competition" </F> rubric: "Unified Eurasian Antimonopoly Space Being Formed"]    [Text] Unfair competition will soon be unable to hide  behind the picket fence of the national borders of former  republics of the USSR and the defunct CEMA [Council for  Ecoonomic Mutual Assistance]: Participants in a conference of  the leaders of antimonopoly organs of CIS countries, Latvia,  Lithuania, and countries of Eastern Europe -- Bulgaria, Poland,  Slovakia, and the Czech Republic -- have agreed to exchange,  within one month, antimonopoly normative acts, laws and draft  laws.    The Kiev conference, in which chiefs of the CIS Executive  Secretariat took part, ended late last week. Having compared  notes on antimonopoly activities, the participants decided to  sum up their experience and, having further set up special  working groups to coordinate efforts in building a  competition-based economy for their countries, to standardize  their antimonopoly laws. It was also decided to initiate an  exchange of information on the state of commodity markets and  the results of scientific research work and to exchange  specialists in the field of antimonopoly activity.    The brunt of the coordination of this work falls on the  interstate CIS Council for Antimonopoly Policy, whose second  sitting took place within the Kiev meeting framework. Among  other things, it worked out proposals to the Executive Committee  and the CIS Interparliamentary CIS Assembly on harmonization of  antimonopoly laws within the framework of the Treaty on the  Conduct of a Concerted Antimonopoly Policy signed by the CIS  heads of government in Ashkhabad [Ashgabat] in December 1993.  Bulgaria wanted to accede to the treaty; participants in the  conference supported its initiative on creating an interstate  association on competition policy.</p>

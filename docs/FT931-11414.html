			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Serbs feel the pinch from UN sanctions: Milosevic may turn the embargo to his advantage, but the economy is crumbling SERBIAN barges may be running illicit cargoes of oil up the Danube under the eyes of United Nations monitors, but nevertheless eight months of sanctions and the oil embargo, in particular, have hit hard. The latest casualties of sanctions were two McDonald's hamburger restaurants in Belgrade, which this week closed down after their supplies of foreign toppings were depleted. Yugoslav media meanwhile, has mourned the loss of the Disney cartoon figures Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck, after Disney Publications severed a contract it has had for nearly 60 years with Yugoslavia. Rising inflation and a sharp decline in the availability of goods also reflect the debilitating impact of sanctions on the Serbian economy, already reeling from 18 months of war and the collapse of trade with the former Yugoslav republics. Prices rose 100 per cent in December, while industrial production was down 22 per cent on a year ago. More than 800,000 workers have been sent on compulsory holidays as state enterprises have cut production. Some 70 per cent of Serbia's 9.8m inhabitants are earning less than Dollars 370 a year, estimates economist Mr Tomislav Popovic. The value of the Yugoslav dinar continues to plummet as the government printing presses work overtime. On the bustling black market, hard currency is sold at eight times the official rate. In a move which could indicate the virtual abandonment of the dinar, JUMCO, a major textile manufacturer in southern Serbia, this week announced that all prices would be denominated in dollars, payable in dinars at the black market rate. Last November the UN tightened the sanctions originally imposed last May on Serbia and Montenegro for supporting Serb forces in the Bosnian war. But diplomats believe Serbia, under President Slobodan Milosevic, has not been compelled to cut off oil supplies to industry or the Yugoslav army. Instead, it has extended winter holidays for schools and universities due to the shortage of heating oil. Although oil is undoubtedly in short supply, analysts point out that Serbia produces 25 per cent of the oil it needs. 'There is absolutely no reason to believe the army doesn't have topped-up fuel tanks. They do have problems, some of which are logistical, of getting fuel to places,' says one western diplomat. 'But Serbia has not yet made the tough choices which would hit industry or transport.' Sanctions have, however, provided Serbian President Milosevic with an alibi for Serbia's economic decline. Backed by his control of state television, Mr Milosevic has vowed that the west will never succeed in bringing Serbia to its knees. 'In terms of the economy, the sanctions are doing a better job than before. But on the political front, they are having a counter-effect,' said a western diplomat in Belgrade. Belgrade economists and diplomats fear that Mr Milosevic so far has capitalised on the decline in the standard of living, and has used the sanctions to his advantage. 'They have provided the government with an excuse to impose wage and price controls and destroy the market economy,' believes Mr Popovic. 'The embargo has radicalised the population, by feeding the propaganda about international conspiracies against the Serbian people,' he adds.</p>

			<p><P> December 31, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: HOMEWARD BOUND  </P> <P> Sources tell us that Andrei Konchalovsky will return to his Soviet homeland  this summer, to write and direct "The Inner Circle," a drama about corruption  within the Stalinist regime that presumably could not have been filmed there  pre-glasnost. (Calls to the director's representatives were not returned at  press time).  </P> <P> Konchalovsky, who left the Soviet Union on a visa in 1980, will shoot in  Moscow. Tom Hulce is expected to star.  </P> <P> The script, co-written by Anatoly Usov, finds Ivan, an uneducated film  projectionist, thrust into a position of power when he's assigned to screen  movies for Stalin. Ivan, who ultimately joins the KGB, finds himself a witness  to the paranoia, corruption and brutality of the ruling government.  </P> <P> Along with returning Konchalovsky to familiar physical turf, the project  returns him to the psychological studies for which he's known ("Maria's  Lovers," "Shy People").  </P> <P> He also helmed the critically hailed "Runaway Train" (1985), as well as the  critically assailed "Tango &amp; Cash," just out, which he exited before  shooting wrapped. Albert Magnoli ("Purple Rain") completed the filming, but  Konchalovsky's the credited director. Pat H. Broeske  </P></p>

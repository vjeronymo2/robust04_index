			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / The Westminster Report: Party chiefs heaped praise on 'flagship' A history of praising Westminster city council makes it almost impossible for the national Conservative party to distance itself now. Westminster, which has always been Conservative-controlled, emerged as a Tory 'flagship' in the late 1980s. In 1990, the year the community charge or poll tax was introduced, Westminster and neighbouring Wandsworth were promoted by Mr Kenneth Baker, then Conservative party chairman, as 'flagship boroughs'. Results from the two boroughs dominated the headlines the day after the local elections that year, where elsewhere in the country Conservatives made serious losses. Mr Jack Straw, Labour's local government spokesman, yesterday relished publishing details of previous praise heaped on Westminster by ministers during the campaign. In 1990 Mr David Hunt - now the employment secretary but then minister with responsibility for the community charge - described Westminster's election performance as a 'stunning success' and 'a source of cheer for every Conservative'. Mr Baker, in his memoirs, describes the council as being led 'with verve by Shirley Porter . . . with spirit and imagination she had cut back expenditure but improved services'. Westminster's role as a 'pioneer' for ambitious Conservative policies has continued. Its council tax is one of the lowest in the country and is proudly displayed on a banner in City Hall. It has also introduced a series of controversial reforms. These have not been thwarted by the district auditor's investigations. Only last month Westminster became the first council to invite the private sector to take over its day nurseries. The council is in the forefront of extending competitive tendering beyond manual blue-collar services. It also took a more confrontational stance in last year's dispute between the government and the teachings unions over national curriculum testing. Westminster sent a letter to headteachers threatening that those who refused to co-operate in carrying out national curriculum testing 'should have deductions made from their salary'. It also said that deductions from teachers' pay would be made. The move was widely interpreted as an attempt by the government to persuade other education authorities to take a similar stance, although eventually the tests were boycotted in all Westminster schools, and the council took no action. Dame Shirley Porter was the figurehead of the flagship. Leader for eight years until 1991 and then mayor of Westminster for a year, she was arguably the best-known Tory politician in the capital. However, she was no stranger to financial controversy, the most famous incident being the decision by the council in 1986 to sell three cemeteries for a total of 15p. In 1990 the district auditor found no case for surcharging councillors over the cemeteries, which had been valued at more than Pounds 15m, but the decision opened the council to ridicule before the 1990 elections. The council rode out that storm, but the repercussions of the 'gerrymandering' allegations could last much longer.</p>

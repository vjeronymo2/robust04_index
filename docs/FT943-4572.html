			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Apec can be a force for global free trade Sir, My colleagues on the Apec Eminent Persons Group and I appreciate your thoughtful comments ('Seeking a role for Apec', September 2) on the new report, Achieving the Apec Vision: Free and Open Trade in the Asia Pacific, which we recently submitted to the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) forum. We would offer four comments in response. First, you ask whether the extensive dependence of most Apec members on the US market is a sufficient basis for regional trade liberalisation. There are certainly other bases: the large potential gains from eliminating the substantial barriers that still dot the region; concerns about the weaknesses of the global trading system and inward-looking regionalism in other parts of the world; the security interdependence across the Pacific and the American interest in the dynamic growth of Asia. But the members' desire to maintain their trade access to the US propels them to-wards new liberalisation initiatives because trade policy clearly slides backward towards protectionism in the absence of steady forward momentum. Second, you note the presence of important trade disputes among the members of Apec. The need to address such conflicts more effectively is in fact one of our main reasons for recommending prompt adoption of a comprehensive regional trade programme, including the creation of a dispute mediation service to help resolve the disputes directly. We would hope that such a programme would inter alia induce the US to redirect at least some of its negotiating efforts into regional channels, and it is noteworthy that the US government has announced publicly that it will not be raising labour and environmental issues in Apec. Third, we are confident that Apec will respond positively to your query over whether its regional efforts will support the global trading system. Leading European trade negotiators have testified that last year's Apec summit in Seattle was a significant, perhaps the significant, turning point in bringing the Uruguay Round to a successful conclusion. Your concern that Apec would hurt the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade by diverting negotiating resources is belied by the nearly simultaneous achievements of the Uruguay Round and three regional agreements - Europe 1992, Nafta and the Asean Free Trade Agreement. The global trading interests of all Apec members assure that they will do whatever is necessary to implement the Uruguay Round and strengthen the Gatt. Every proposal in our EPG Report either conforms fully to Gatt or goes beyond it to create new 'Gatt-plus' arrangements. Our group indeed believes that Apec can become a leading force for global trade progress. We look forward to further dialogue during the run-up to the Apec summit that will address these issues in Indonesia on November 15. C.

			<p><P> September 25, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DANCE REVIEW;  </P> <P> BANDO MITSUHIRO KAI PROGRAM  </P> <P> The 20th anniversary program by Bando Mitsuhiro Kai began auspiciously in the  Japan America Theatre Saturday night with Mitsujiro and Hideko Bando  (distinguished guests from Japan) joining Mitsuhiro Bando in the ceremonial  "Shiki Sanbaso." Here the meticulous technical control and expressive purity of  Japanese classical dancing were evident in each tiny inclination of the head,  every formal deployment of sleeve or fan.  </P> <P> The performance ended, some three and a half hours later, with "Gion No  Yozakura," in which one sober, gestural duet by Hirochizu and Hiroteru Bando  distilled the exquisite stylization of womanhood at the heart of the eight-part  program.  </P> <P> Grand Kabuki is, of course, an all-male art -- but Kabuki concert dance glories  in its women. Indeed, this showcase for the dance school that Mitsuhiro Bando  founded 20 years ago in East Los Angeles managed to include one piece  dramatizing female superiority ("Onna Date," with Yukiko Sasaki triumphing in  formalized combat with Kanjiro and Kiyoshi Bando) and one feminized version of  a Grand Kabuki masterwork.  </P> <P> Usually, "Renjishi" shows a father lion educating his son. In their first  scene, lionhood is presented obliquely but later the characters reappear to  prowl the stage wearing eight-foot-long manes.  </P> <P> On Saturday, however, Hideko Bando portrayed a mother lion opposite a high  school student from Torrance who was granted the stage name of Hidesomi Bando  only this April. Thus the imitative and instructional action of their duet  assumed a new significance. And if the spectacular mane-swirling that forms the  climax of "Renjishi" was missing, Hideko Bando's powerful dramatic focus gave  each stamp and head-toss true leonine majesty.  </P> <P> Dances celebrating different types of flowers and different types of women  completed the program -- many featuring younger members of the Bando Mitsuhiro  Kai. Taped music accompanied the dancing. -- LEWIS SEGAL  </P></p>

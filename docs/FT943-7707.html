			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / Disabled Remploy staff to hold strike ballot Unions are to hold a strike ballot among disabled workers at Remploy, the manufacturer at the centre of a row over the government's decision to remove its status as a priority supplier in line with a European directive on public procurement. The GMB general union, with the largest membership among a six-union consortium at the company, said that many members in the Remploy workforce were in a mood to take strike action over pay and conditions. Feelings were running high, it said, because of the way Mr Michael Portillo, the employment secretary, made it clear that he would be complying with the directive without seeking to challenge it. Union leaders are angry at the way that the company's offer to increase basic pay by 2.5 per cent has been linked to proposed changes in working conditions. The GMB says that the proposals covering shift work and working hours will effectively bar the most severely disabled from working at the company. At present disabled workers are considered suitable by Remploy if they are able to work for 28 minutes in every hour but the company wants to change this to 40 minutes an hour. The move would affect pay because bonuses are based on these times. Remploy has made the offer conditional on acceptance of a scheme designed to cut down on absence levels. The company also wants to introduce shift patterns outside normal office hours which, the unions say, will increase the difficulties of getting to work for some disabled people. Union officials say the proposals reflect a harder management approach to industrial relations. They say this is out of step with the original spirit of the company. The conditions have reinforced union suspicions that the government is seeking a more competitive climate at the company. Mr Portillo disputed earlier accusations that his department's decision to drop the special status for disabled workers in winning government contracts was motivated by a desire to subject such suppliers to greater market pressure. Mr Phil Davies, the GMB national officer for Remploy workers, said: 'This government has decided to mount an all-out attack on disabled people. The unions are fully prepared to defend these workers - our case is strong and just. 'The strings attached to the offer will cause tremendous hardship for these workers. Flexible working and the changes to the work timetable could mean a 12-hour day for a disabled person with no overtime pay.' Mr Kevin Barron, Labour's employment spokesman, said the proposed change in working conditions for Remploy staff 'appears to be a further step in the government's attack on disabled people'. Mr Barron accused the government of seeking to force disabled workers to compete without assistance. 'The sort of people who work for companies like Remploy simply cannot compete in the marketplace in the ideological way that the government talks about,' he said. Remploy said that some proposals, including those on job grades, the bonus scheme and flexible working, were topics put forward for discussion. It was only seeking a commitment from the union to discuss these issues. Union officials said, however, that it was made clear that the company would be seeking changes. The pay offer, said Remploy, was in line with public-sector guidelines. The strike ballot, which closes on September 8, is being held by five out of the six unions in the consortium.</p>

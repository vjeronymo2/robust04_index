			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Property Plus: How to date your house - Expert help in tracing the history of your home is not hard to find HOW OLD is my house? And how can I improve it without damaging its historical character? A quick answer to the second question could be: do not put in plastic windows or face the exterior walls with stick-on rusticated stonework. And think twice about adding a Victorian-style conservatory - often they do not fit, which may be why so few were built in the first place. The full answer is to find out its history and then decide how to alter it or, in the light of what you discover, leave it as it is. You never know what you may find. Houses are long-lived animals that survive changes in almost every generation. Behind the chain-store high street facades lurk medieval merchants' houses. (In Barnstaple, Devon, do not miss the Tudor shipmaster's ornate plastered ceiling in the Woolwich Building Society.) And, surprisingly often, village houses turn out to have Georgian fronts. Start by examining the house thoroughly yourself. Look out for blocked windows, doors and stairs. If the floor changes level, why? Did the house once have its own well, or built-in copper cauldron for the laundry? Has it always had the same main entrance? You will find it easy to spot some of the alterations, although arranging them in sequence may be hard. See what Pevsner's guides say about the house and whether there is an entry in Victoria County History, the title of a series of county histories which you should find in the public library. If it is listed, the particulars are recorded in the relevant section of the Department of the Environment/Department of National Heritage Green Book (in the public library or at the local planning authority). There may also be entries in the Sites and Monuments Record (SMR) which the local archaeological unit keeps (the county council will tell you where to find them) and at the county records office. If you do not have the time, inclination or background for this research, seek out the experts. They will survey the building and work out its history from the bricks and mortar and will search documents, should you require. The archaeological units, which advise councils on what to do with planning applications for listed buildings (and sometimes for non-listed) and for scheduled ancient monuments, usually have a contract side to survey buildings. There are also private consultants. They will produce reports with photographs and plans, sections and elevations drawn to scale, which should tell you much more than you alone could discover. They will also help if you are contemplating work on the house and will probably also want to put the information into the SMR for future use. A typical brief for the Canterbury Archaeological Trust, one of the local units, was a derelict bus garage which was to be restored as offices. It might have seemed an unpromising start but the team recovered two-bay medieval building with a crown post roof, and 17th and 19th century additions. After the first world war it lost its original facade and first floor framing when it was converted to a garage. For more precise dating of the medieval part, they could have use dendrochronology, taking sections from one of the larger beams or coring samples. This would show the pattern of annual growth rings, some thick and some thin, which reflect the patterns of medieval weather. Trees grow more in wet, warm years. Thin rings mean harsh winters. The next task is to match the 'floating' sample to master patterns which have been built up by correlating hundreds of samples and counting them backwards from the present. Computers make this fairly easy and will produce dates for the rings. These dates give the year of the latest ring preserved. If the beam still has its bark that will be the date the tree was cut - which may be few years before it was used in the building. Tree rings have remarkable accuracy, and have dated the monastic barn at Great Coxwell, in Oxfordshire, to within a decade of 1300, settling an argument that ran between the early 12th and late 14th centuries. The Greater Manchester Unit recently surveyed a cottage in the nearby village of Broadbottom for its owners. The cottage is the only surviving building of cloth printing works built beside the fast-flowing river Etherow, and in use from around 1763 to 1919. The records produce a complicated history, which probably began with a still earlier corn mill on the site, followed by a woollen mill converted for cotton in the mill boom of the 1790s. It prospered until the mid-19th century, with 450 workers in 1851, when business started to decline. Printing stopped in 1913. Then, the Happy Bran Company made soap powder until 1919 in part of the works, when it was sold. The Greater Manchester unit worked out that the Cottage had four building phases which mirrored the history of what the 1919 sale particulars called 'the most famous Calico Printing Works in England.' The lucky owners now have a fascinating history of their cottage and the details they needed to extend it. Ron Shoesmith, of the Hereford Unit, stresses that much of the work is to ensure that buildings are understood before they are altered. Listed (and convertible) barns in Wales and an old button and buckle factory in Walsall, for which a housing trust was seeking planning permission, have been recent briefs. The unit has also surveyed two old gate houses for the Landmark Trust. The unit's most intriguing brief evokes Petra in Jordan, or the troglodyte life of early man. The National Trust commissioned the unit to survey rows of rock-cut houses at Kinver Edge, in Shropshire, before restoring two as a single house or for the custodian. These rare dwellings are partly cut out of the rock, partly built up in stone in front. Farm workers and iron workers use to live in them. The oldest record is of 1800 but they probably go back earlier, and they were in use until the 1950s or 1960s. They are two-bedroom houses and at one time there were 11 families in the row. When they wanted a house, they did not have to pay. The contractor paid them to quarry the stone. Canterbury Archaeological Trust, 92 Broad Street, Canterbury CT1 2LU (0227-462062).

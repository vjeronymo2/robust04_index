			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / Iraq prices increase after food rations are cut A rush on staple foods is pushing up prices in Baghdad as Iraqis scramble to cope with a government decision to cut rations by as much as half, Reuter reports from Baghdad. The government decided on Sunday to reduce food rations, blaming a poor harvest and continuing UN trade sanctions, imposed to punish Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Meagre as they were, the rations staved off starvation and made available around half a person's basic needs at giveaway prices . 'It is very worrying, particularly for children in poor families,' said Mr Thomas Ekval, United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) representative in Iraq. He feared an increase in malnutrition. Each Iraqi will now receive every month 6 kg (13 lb) of flour instead of nine, 1.25 kg (2.7 lb) of rice instead of 2.5 kg, 750 grammes (1.6 lbs) of sugar instead of 1.5 kgs, and 625 grammes (22 ounces) of cooking oil instead of 750. The UN hands out its own food rations to about half a million Iraqis it terms 'destitute persons' and almost twice that number in northern Iraq, now under Kurdish rebel control. Mr Ekval said the cut-back would reduce each person's daily intake of calories and protein by as much as half. Civil servants and members of the armed forces will receive 2,000 dinars a month each to meet the shortfall. But the decision had an immediate impact on prices which reached unprecedented levels yesterday. Prices almost doubled, making it impossible for salaried people to make up for the cut in their rations. The official exchange rate is about 500 dinars to the dollar and the illegal black market rate is between 600 to 700. Flour almost doubled to nearly 200 dinars a kg (100 dinars a pound), sugar from 230 dinars a kg to about 500. Prices of items left out of the new rationing system, such as razor blades, matches, shaving cream, salt and toothpaste, also doubled. The government said the measure was to 'organise economic conditions' and urged Iraqis to remain 'steadfast' and be patient. But it seems the decision, the harshest since sanctions came into force more than four years ago, was taken when it became clear that the embargo would not be eased or lifted soon as earlier thought. The official press lambasted the US, which it said was behind efforts to maintain the stiff regime of sanctions intact, despite Baghdad's co-operation with the UN on dismantling its big weapons.</p>

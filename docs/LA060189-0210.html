			<p><P> June 1, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> U.S. TIGHTENS SCHOOL RULES FOR STUDENT LOANS  </P> <P> Education Secretary Lauro F. Cavazos today unveiled strict new regulations  designed to crack down on schools that are turning out large numbers of  delinquent borrowers and contributing to a rising burden for taxpayers.  </P> <P> Under the rules, schools with default rates above 60% will be subject to  limitation, suspension or termination from the government's massive student  loan program.  </P> <P> Schools with 40% to 60% of their students failing to pay back loans must reduce  the figure by 5% a year or face the same penalties.  </P> <P> All vocational schools, regardless of their default rates, must provide  information on completion and job placement rates to all prospective students.  </P> <P> Vocational schools are considered prime offenders in the default problem, which  is expected to cost taxpayers $1.8 billion this year.  </P> <P> "We must weed out unethical schools and other program participants whose sole  purpose is to profit at the expense of our students and taxpayers," Cavazos  said. "Today, we are taking decisive action against those who cheat our  citizens, those who promise to educate but deliver only a debt."  </P> <P> Cavazos said it was never intended that 37 cents out of every dollar spent on  the student loan program would go to cover defaulted loans.  </P></p>

			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / World Bond Markets: Frankfurt Bunds staged a recovery last week but can this be sustained in the coming days? Sentiment may be helped by data on manufacturing and industrial output for May, due this week. Mr Klaus Baader at Lehman Brothers predicts that both figures will grow by less than 0.5 per cent - a sharp slowdown from the previous month and further confirmation that the German economic recovery is pallid rather than vigorous. Provisional inflation figures for June are also expected. The consensus is that the year-on-year rate will at worst be unchanged from the 3 per cent of May, although the closely-watched number could fall to 2.9 per cent. Mr Klaus Holschuh of Commerzbank in Frankfurt, says the market may recover confidence, with the yield on 10-year bunds heading below 7 per cent. He warns though that there may well be false starts and investors may sell into a price recovery. Crucial to the market in coming weeks are Germany's private and other 'non-bank' investors, who bought DM20bn of bunds in the first four months of the year. The Bundesbank is hoping to drive these investors out of short-term deposits into longer-term investments and this has started to happen. But these purchases are offset by sales by foreign investors who off-loaded DM37.7bn of bunds in February to April.</p>

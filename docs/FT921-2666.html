			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / PSBR growth boosted by fall in tax revenue PUBLIC-SECTOR finances continued to deteriorate last month as big increases in government spending and weaker tax revenues led to high borrowing. The public sector borrowing requirement for February was Pounds 1bn, including privatisation proceeds of Pounds 0.8bn. This compares with a net repayment of Pounds 0.6bn in the same month last year. Although the figure was high it came as little surprise to the markets. In last week's Budget Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, pointed towards heavy government borrowing when he forecast a PSBR of Pounds 13.8bn for the fiscal year ending on March 31. February's figure, released by the Central Statistical Office yesterday, brought the PSBR for the first 11 months of the fiscal year to Pounds 7.4bn, compared with a surplus of Pounds 3.6bn in the same period last year. This implies record borrowing for March of Pounds 6.4bn. The Treasury said March was always a big month for borrowing as government departments rushed to spend up to their cash limits before the end of the year. Overall, expenditure grew much faster than revenue in the first 11 months of the fiscal year. Total government cash outlays were 10 per cent higher than in the same period of 1990-91, while total cash receipts grew by only 2.5 per cent. Net departmental spending in February alone was 20 per cent higher than a year ago. Weak economic growth over the coming year, combined with high government spending commitments and lower privatisation revenues mean the PSBR is likely to worsen in the next two years. In the Budget Mr Lamont forecast a PSBR of Pounds 28bn in 1992-93 and Pounds 32bn in 1993-94. The PSBR, excluding privatisation proceeds, was Pounds 15.2bn in the first 11 months of this financial year compared with a figure close to zero in the same period in 1990-91. Privatisation proceeds from the second instalment of the sale of the electricity generating companies of Pounds 0.8bn helped to temper February's PSBR. Further assistance came from local authorities paying back a surprising Pounds 0.7m. In the 11 months to February privatisation proceeds amounted to Pounds 7.8bn  -Pounds 4bn more than proceeds in the same period last year. Mr Simon Briscoe, senior UK economist at Greenwell Montagu said: 'February's figure supports the view that public finances are continuing to deteriorate and we can expect to see large borrowing in 1992-93.'</p>

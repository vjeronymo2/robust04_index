			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Yeltsin demands greater powers and support for reform plans MR BORIS YELTSIN, the Russian president, yesterday demanded increased powers and support for his reform programme as he challenged his parliamentary critics in advance of today's opening session of the Russian Congress of Peoples' Deputies. He used a meeting of his supporters in the Rossiya Hotel next to the Kremlin to denounce attempts led by Mr Anatoly Sobchak, the St Petersburg mayor, to create a parliamentary system with a figurehead president in Russia. He said this would be 'suicide' in the present conditions of weak parties and increasing tendencies of disintegration of the state. 'The present situation calls for a presidential republic for two or three years . . . the government should have the right to be free in its activities,' he told the 'Citizen's Congress', which brought together some 4,000 supporters. Drafts of the constitution already envisage clipping Mr Yeltsin's powers by giving deputies the right to veto by simple majority the appointment of ministers, including the prime minister - a post he occupies. Many deputies want to win back the veto rights which were suspended last year at Mr Yeltsin's request. Some deputies believe that the struggle over the constitution may end in stalemate, with none being adopted at the end of the nine-day congress. The meeting was picketed by around 1,000 communists and nationalists, who jostled and threw small coins at some of those attending. Mr Yegor Yakovklev, the head of the state television and radio network, was pulled about and his glasses smashed, while militia looked on. The demonstrators chanted nationalist and anti-semitic slogans, and are likely to attempt a show of force at today's meeting of the congress, to be held in a Kremlin hall. Mr Yeltsin has made some changes in his government, the latest on Saturday. He stripped Mr Alexander Shokhin of his post as labour and social security minister, while leaving him as deputy prime minister. Mr Yegor Gaidar, the first deputy prime minister, has lost his finance portfolio, while Mr Genady Burbulis, the senior first deputy prime minister, lost his seat in the cabinet. Instead, he has a role in the presidential apparatus overseeing domestic, foreign, security and intelligence policy - effectively deputising for Mr Yeltsin on the entire range of presidential concerns. Mr Yeltsin confirmed that the pace of reform would be slackened, with tax cuts to be announced, on top of credits to industry and agriculture amounting to Rbs200bn. Further changes in the government were also foreshadowed, including the co-option of 'major businessmen and industrialists' into the cabinet. He reaffirmed his commitment to market-based change when he said: 'Only one way out can exist today - the continuation of radical reforms. 'The main thing with which I was entrusted by the voters at the presidential elections was to move to a normal state of life through reform. I shall not leave this path. I believe there is no other choice today.' So far, so good, Page 14</p>

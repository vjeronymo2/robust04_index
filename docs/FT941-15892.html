			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / Court told of Vatican bribes channel The decisive role of the Vatican bank in channelling alleged bribes in Italy's political corruption scandal was admitted in court yesterday by one of the most important intermediaries involved. Mr Luigi Bisignani, the former head of external relations at the big Ferruzzi industrial group, admitted he had used the Istituto per le Opere di Religione (IOR), the Vatican bank, to transfer massive payments from the company to secret accounts outside Italy. The IOR achieved public notoriety in the early 1980s when it was implicated in the collapse of Banco Ambrosiano, the Milanese bank run by Roberto Calvi. Calvi was later found hanging under Blackfriars Bridge in London. The payments by Ferruzzi were allegedly made to obtain the support of politicians for the dissolution of the ill-fated Enimont chemicals joint venture between Ferruzzi's Montedison industrial arm and the state-owned Eni energy group. The 'Enimont affair', in which Ferruzzi allegedly paid a total of about L150bn (Pounds 59m) in kickbacks, has become one of the most important strands in the two-year corruption probe. The scandals have cut a swathe through the Italian political and business establishment and drawn in most of the country's leading parties. Making his first public appearance since giving himself up last week, Mr Bisignani, a former journalist with contacts in the Christian Democrat party and the Vatican, said he had acted on the instructions of Mr Raul Gardini, the former head of Ferruzzi who committed suicide last year. Mr Bisignani was speaking from the witness box at the trial of Mr Sergio Cusani, a Milanese financier arrested last year as part of the corruption investigations. Mr Cusani, associated with both Mr Gardini and senior members of the Socialist party, allegedly acted as a go-between for Ferruzzi and politicians. The trial, which opened late last year, is the first big prosecution in the corruption affair. Mr Bisignani admitted he had received about L4bn for his efforts to put Mr Gardini in contact with the IOR. The bank does not normally take outside deposits. Milan magistrates are trying to ascertain whether part of the alleged kickbacks ended up in the hands of the large number of intermediaries, such as Mr Bisignani, who were allegedly involved in the transactions. Milan magistrates leading the investigations flew to Luxembourg for information on alleged transfers from Ferruzzi. Mr Cusani admitted that two of the Luxembourg accounts identified as having received L52bn in Ferruzzi money were in his name. While the Milan case, the first in a series of trials, is expected to last several months, Mr Giuseppe Garofano, the former top Ferruzzi executive arrested on Tuesday, was interrogated by Naples magistrates investigating alleged kickbacks in the drugs industry.</p>

			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Election 1992: SNP vote may help Forsyth saga to continue A VISITOR to Stirling can hardly fail to realise it is one of the most closely fought constituencies in Scotland. Roundabouts on the town's outskirts are festooned with party posters while on the streets the lampposts are only missing a contribution from the Monster Raving Loony candidate. Even in far-flung areas of the largely rural constituency, the posters jostle for attention on the approaches to villages. Mr Michael Forsyth holds the seat for the Conservatives with a majority of 548 over Labour. This time six parties are contesting the seat. The Labour candidate, Mrs Kate Phillips, says she is quietly confident. The Scottish National party, which came fourth in 1987, claims it has overtaken both Labour and the Liberal Democrats and is now capturing Conservative votes. In spite of Conservative assertions that its vote is holding up, the campaign seems defensive. Windows on all sides of Tory HQ display SNP posters, and a banner saying 'End the Forsyth saga' flutters from the house next door. Visitors are inspected through a spy hole before the door is unlocked. Mr Forsyth's campaign literature does not mention that he is Scottish minister for health and education. Opponents say this is because reforms in the education and health services have been deeply unpopular in Scotland, and it is safer not to draw attention to his part in them. Mrs Elizabeth Ellis, who runs a shop in the village of Aberfoyle, north-west of Stirling, has two school-age children. She will not be voting for Mr Forsyth. 'School testing, opting out, I have been against it from the start,' she said. Mr Forsyth's agent says he is running a positive campaign based on his record as a constituency MP, with the slogan, 'Working for you.' Mrs Ellis is unimpressed. She said: 'I don't think Michael Forsyth has actually done anything for this constituency.' Along the street, Mrs Margaret Quinn says that Mr Forsyth was unhelpful when she wrote to him about a housing problem. She is undecided, but said: 'I won't be voting for him, anyway.' Mr Forsyth has acquired a controversial reputation. He was pushed out of the chairmanship of the Scottish Conservative party for his right-wing views. Several of his assistants were former members of the far-right Federation of Conservative Students. He is a member of the Thatcherite No Turning Back group. The highlight of his campaign so far was a visit by Mrs Margaret Thatcher. She gave a rousing speech on the benefits of the union and the last 13 years of Conservative rule, which went down well with the local Tories in the hall but may have had a less favourable effect on the floating and tactical voters that Mr Forsyth desperately needs to attract. The danger for Labour in Stirling is not a resurgence in Conservative support but the appeal of the SNP to former Labour voters. Over the country, SNP support has doubled since the last election. If Mr Forsyth slips in with another slim majority, it may well be thanks to the SNP.</p>

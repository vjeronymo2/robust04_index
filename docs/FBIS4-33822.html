			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "A Matter of Consistency"] </F>   [Text] The 1990's are not like the 1960's, OAS Secretary  General Joao Clemente Baena Soares said in justifying Cuba's  rejoining the organization. The calendar was good justification  for him.    No one can ignore the extent and depth of the changes  produced by the current international situation -- quite  different from the situation 30 years ago in the middle of the  Cold War. At that time of tension and confrontation, Cuba  undoubtedly represented a threat to the Americas' common choice  of the liberal, democratic system of government, which inspired  the OAS. It was almost a nightmare: The path on which Fidel  Castro put his country a few months after the ousting of  Fulgencio Batista brought the Cold War to Latin America,  disrespecting all borders.    The socialist bloc never had any complaints about Fidel  Castro's performance as its forefront agent. Without much work  by foreign ministries or information offices, the Cuban  revolution became an export product to all of Latin America. It  was copied, like here in Brazil with a Sierra Maestra-type  guerrilla in Caraparo, or in Angra dos Reis. The death of Che  Guevara gave the revolution a proto-martyr. The revolution also  created the Latin American Solidarity Organization (OLAS) as an  alternative to the OAS.    None of this could survive the end of socialist regimes.  Cuba  was left drifting away, and it gradually approached the market  economy, like China and Vietnam. The obsolete speeches by Fidel  Castro have not been consistent with the increasing number of  concessions he has been forced to make. "No matter what we have  do to save the revolution and the conquests of socialism, we  will never quit socialism," Castro said this year on the  revolution's 35th anniversary. These are the last signs of an  ideology that already has been placed in the museum of history.    Under such circumstances, it makes no sense to keep Cuba  isolated from the community of the Americas. It makes even less  sense to support the commercial embargo that is punishing Cubans  while turning obstinate Castro into a hero. The lucid and  persistent diplomatic action undertaken by Baena Soares is more  significant for the Cuban people than the regular solidarity  campaigns.    Early this year, the UN Human Rights Commission report  advocated the end of the embargo in order to strengthen its  diplomatic-negotiating capacity. In June, while abstaining from  using commerce to pressure China, the United States renewed  China's most-favored-nation status without any strong evidence  of progress in this country's human rights record, which the  United States had demanded. Putting an end to Cuba's banishment  is just a matter of consistency.</p>

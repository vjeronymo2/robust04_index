			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / International Company News: S&amp;P considers upgrading TNT senior debt Standard &amp; Poor's, the US-based credit rating agency, said yesterday that it was considering an upgrade of the senior debt rating of TNT, the Australian transportation group. S&amp;P, which currently has the debt rated single-B, said its review follows a USDollars 150m offering of senior unsecured notes by TNT. This is the third significant fundraising initiative by the company in the past six months. The others were a ADollars 318m issue of convertible preference shares and the ADollars 121m underwritten offering of shares in Holyman, essentially comprising its shipping division interests.</p>

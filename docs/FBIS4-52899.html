			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 14 (YONHAP) -- Chances are high that the  United States and North Korea will meet in a third round of  high-level talks, though North Korea has started refueling at a  5-megawatt nuclear reactor in Yongbyon, a ranking government  official said this weekend.    The official, noting the new U.S.-North Korea meeting is  related to the regular and additional inspections of North  Korea's nuclear facilities by the International Atomic Energy  Agency (IAEA) as requested in the U.N. Security Council  president's recent statement on North Korea, said if the IAEA  inspectors arriving in North Korea Tuesday [17 May] conduct  inspections as scheduled, a third round of high-level U.S.-North  Korea talks are highly likely to be held.    Seoul and Washington reportedly interpret Pyongyang's start  of refueling at the 5-mw reactor not as the start of fuel rod  replacement but as the start of preparations for fuel rod  replacement.    Fuel rod replacement requires at least 15 days of reactor  cooling.    If North Korea is found to have started replacing fuel rods  during the coming IAEA inspection, the United States would not  hold the third round of high-level talks with North Korea, the  official said.    Meanwhile, the Asia-Pacific Peace Foundation said U.S.  Assistant Secretary of State for Military and Political Affairs  Robert Gallucci had told Chairman Kim Tae-chung that the third  round of high-level U.S.-North Korea talks would be held in  weeks during their meeting in Washington on Wednesday.    When Kim stressed the need for a package-deal approach to  the  North Korean nuclear issue, Gallucci expressed his approval, the  foundation added.</p>

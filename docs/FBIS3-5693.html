As the  result, 60 percent of the pollees showed positive responses to  the achievements of the Hosoakwa administration. When asked  what is the best achievement of the Hosokawa administration, 37  percent indicated "the enactment of the political reform laws."  To a question asking impressions of Prime Minister Hosokawa,  however, 54 percent said "he has no leadership," and 64 percent  said "he has no control over the coalition parties." Thus, the  majority of the public questions the prime minister's political  leadership. In response to a question on impressions of the  "Kono-led Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]," most respondents  indicated negative images of the giant opposition, as 34 percent  indicated the LDP's "lack of unity in the party."    Regarding the achievements of the Hosokawa administration  over the last six months, 60 percent said there were "favorable"  achievements, and 35 percent said the achievements are  "unfavorable." Followed by "the enactment of the political  reform laws," the pollees said the positive achievements of the  Hosokawa administration were: "Partial liberalization of the  rice market" (21 percent); "the 6 trillion yen income tax cut in  advance of an enactment of consumption tax hike" (17 percent);  and "positive discussions with LDP President Kono" (16 percent).    On the other hand, major responses to a question asking the  negative aspects of the administration were: "Shinseito  Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa's excessive influence on the  administration" (34 percent); "partial liberalization of the  rice market" (29 percent); "the Social Democratic Party of  Japan's opposition to important policies of the coalition  government" (21 percent); and "increase in bureaucrats'  influence on political issues" (15 percent).    Concerning impressions of the prime minister's "leadership,"  43 percent said "he has enough leadership," but 54 percent said  "he has no leadership." With respect to "the prime minister's  control over the coalition parties," 64 percent said "he has no  control," while 28 percent said "he has adequate control."</p>

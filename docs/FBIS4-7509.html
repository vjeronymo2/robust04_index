			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Renato Cemerika and Vito Bulica: "The Muslims </F> Have Secretly Built a Navy"]    [Text] When the war began in Bosnia and Herzegovina two  years ago, the Muslim army was practically nonexistent. There  were units of the MUP [Ministry of Internal Affairs], a bit of  territorial defense [TO], and armed groups of Muslim youths  with differing views of the political and military objectives  of the fight, and most of the talk was about the Patriotic  League. That is why the Croatian Defense Council [HVO] played  the decisive role in defending a large portion of the territory  of Bosnia and Herzegovina at that time. The Muslim units became  stronger, underwent transformation, and ultimately the Army of  Bosnia and Herzegovina was formed by unifying all the available  potential. Today that army even has trained military cadres,  mainly former officers of the former JNA [Yugoslav People's  Army], some of whom took part in the war in 1991 against the  Republic of Croatia, but left the JNA after the war began in  Bosnia and Herzegovina.    No one has as yet given a complete answer to the question of  how and where the Muslim leadership has been getting arms and  equipment for its army. Official sources speak about "materiel"  found in the MUP, booty captured from the enemy is mentioned as  an additional source along with its own production in plants of  the "special-purpose industry," which are located on territory  under control of the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and  occasional purchases are mentioned incidentally. Although no  one wants to say anything about the ways in which those  occasional purchases are advanced into Bosnia and Herzegovina,  it is evident that military equipment is being acquired on the  world black market and delivered to Bosnia and Herzegovina in  spite of the embargo on the importing of arms. Eyewitnesses,  including, for example, a journalist of the German television  station ZDF, say that they have seen in Sarajevo ammunition  made in Iran; at one time there was quite a bit of noise over  the origin of a missile which destroyed an armored vehicle of  the HVO in Gornji Vakuf; and even the fact that arms and  ammunition are being produced in Bosnia and Herzegovina  indicates that there are certain supply channels, because the  territory under control of the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina  does not have everything necessary for independent production.  <H5>  The Fight for Influence </H5>   Although arms and equipment of Western origin in the  possession of the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina can be  logically explained only by delivery in humanitarian convoys  and aircraft for delivery of aid to the surrounded Muslim  enclaves, it is not possible to provide a solid confirmation  even of that explanation. However, throughout the entire story  of delivery of arms to Bosnia and Herzegovina this is not the  only unknown, nor probably is it even the most interesting one:  It is not more interesting than the one about who "is covering"  the costs of the purchase and shipment. One can get a  suggestion of the answer from the fact that the Islamic  countries, even in an assessment of Alija Izetbegovic, are not  setting aside sufficient funds to care for casualties in Bosnia  and Herzegovina. That is, it is hard to believe that the  oil-rich Islamic countries, especially those in which Islamic  (fundamentalist) regimes are in power, are forgetting Muslims  in any part of the globe, especially if they are in a situation  which could deteriorate into their complete destruction, but at  the same time could also result in the creation of another  country with an Islamic regime.    Reliable reports indicate that one should go beyond logical  judgment. According to those reports, the Islamic countries,  above all Iran and Saudi Arabia, are investing large sums to  equip the Muslim army in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The visit of  every political, military, and humanitarian official from the  Islamic countries presupposes an abundant cash donation, and  all that money is flowing into accounts which are mostly under  the control of Haris Silajdzic, prime minister, and Bakir  Alispahic, minister of internal affairs. There is indeed even a  certain rivalry taking place between Saudi Arabia and Iran,  because each of these two states wants to achieve maximum  influence in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and today this is possible  exclusively by offering all possible support to the Muslim army.  <H5>  Boats for Fast Missions </H5>   The most recent form of rivalry evident between the two  countries when it comes to expanding influence on the Muslims  of Bosnia and Herzegovina are the orders of ships for the  future Muslim navy and the training of Muslim naval officers.  That branch of the surrounded force, in the opinion of the  command of the Muslim army, is essential to the survival of the  Muslim people. "Unless we have a sea and a navy, Yugoslavia and  Croatia will smother us, because those two states have a navy  which should be taken into account," says one of the high  Muslim officers. Iran has ordered 17 vessels for a future  Muslim navy in Scandinavian shipyards. Six rubber boats, each  of which carries 25 men fully armed, have been ordered; they  are part of the combat equipment intended for the coast guard.  These personnel are not part of the boat's crew, but that is  the number of marines the vessel carries to the intervention  point. There are also orders for six assault landing boats that  will be built of light metal. These boats are today being built  either of light metal or plastic reinforced with fiberglass,  and they are designed for anticommando activities and rapid  missions on the open sea. The future Muslim navy is also to get  four coastal rescue boats used in navies to provide assistance  in towing larger vessels, in transport, and in aiding landing  vessels in their withdrawal after performance of their mission.  The 17th vessel is a salvage vessel, a vessel intended above  all for carrying arms and ammunition, but it is also equipped  to rescue damaged vessels and to raise vessels which have sunk.  <H5>  Where To Find Sailors </H5>   Since naval officers in the former Yugoslav navy were  largely  from the Croatian coast, in spite of the carefully conducted  personnel policy, the numerous defections of trained personnel  from the JNA to the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina have not  provided the Muslim army with a particularly large number of  men trained for active service in the navy. So that the vessels  ordered, some of which have already done their shakedown  cruise, would not be without crews, the Islamic Republic of  Iran has decided to accept about 200 Muslims for training as  future naval officers. That entire program was annoying to  Saudi Arabia, and so that country, in an effort to reduce or  completely eliminate Iranian (Shiite) influence on the Bosnian  Muslims, ordered four vessels which informed sources say are  the most up-to-date in the world.    The number of future naval officers and also the number of  naval vessels ordered are only the beginning of activities to  organize a Muslim navy, although we can still not say in what  port it would tie up. At a time when he was still powerful,  Sefer Halilovic publicly announced his intention to enter Ploce  with Muslim units and plant his flag there. Muslim politicians  one after the other, in much more refined style, of course,  began long ago to talk about the necessity of access to the sea  for the Muslim national territory in Bosnia and Herzegovina,  Croatian and Muslim negotiators have spent many hours on this  problem in negotiations for peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina,  but a Muslim navy probably never even occurred to an objective  observer. In certain Muslim circles who consider the present  state of affairs to be a national rebirth for the Bosnian  Muslims and who believe that this is the right moment for a  permanent solution of the problem of a state for the Bosnian  Muslims, there is constant mention of the idea of a Muslim sea  from the Neretva to Bar, which means that there would be an  abundance of suitable locations for a naval port.  <H5>  A Navy Without a Port </H5>   Semso Tankovic said on a recent television program: "The  Bosnian Muslims will have a navy, that is quite certain." Even  he did not say in what port it would tie up. The existence of  "naval" plans is not denied even by Alija Izetbegovic, but he,  taking advantage of the results of the most recent Croat-Muslim  negotiations, talks about a joint federal navy. Because an  agreement about the armed forces of the future federation and  confederation still has not been spelled out precisely, one can  only guess about the federal navy. The question, that is, is  whether there will be such a navy at all. Corps General Anton  Tus said in a recent interview: "From the operational  standpoint, preparation of the armed forces and the conduct of  defensive warfare will require coordination of certain wartime  units of the two states and a joint command in the use of those  forces. I am referring to ground forces, air force and air  defense, while defense on the sea is in the jurisdiction of  Croatia."    The beginning of the Muslim navy was ordered when there was  not even any mention of a U.S. peace initiative, so it is  possible that even the top Muslim political leadership itself  does not know what it will do with it if the negotiations about  federation and confederation are taken all the way to a  successful conclusion. But the question of the port where they  plan to tie up their navy still remains open. If it is Neum or  even Ploce, then there is no point in building the navy, not  because ecological balance would be destroyed by building a  port at Neum, but because that port would not have an outlet to  the open sea. A Muslim navy stationed in it would be imprisoned  in an area of less than 100 square kilometers.</p>

			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Management: Policy codifies power for non-executives - Martin Dickson considers General Motors' new guidelines on the role of its board of directors It has been variously hailed as a 'Magna Carta for US directors', a 'very important corporate governance document', and a 'very commendable example'. The subject of all this praise is a new, six-page document issued by General Motors after several months of hard thought and years of bitter experience. It lays down the company's guidelines on the role and composition of its board of directors. The chief message is that power should be vested primarily in the board's non-executive directors, rather than the group's chief executive. The guidelines thus institutionalise the dramatic changes at GM in 1992, when the board's non-executive directors ousted the then chief executive, Robert Stempel, and replaced him with Jack Smith. Stempel's position as chairman was filled by John Smale, the non-executive director who had led this boardroom revolt. It was a remarkable change for GM. Throughout the 1980s the board had been dominated by Roger Smith, who combined the roles of chairman and chief executive. Ross Perot, a one-time board member, likened other members to 'pet rocks' because of what he saw as their passivity. Many other US companies, prodded by shareholder unrest, have made outside directors more independent of management, though chief executives still wield great power in some groups. The significance of GM's guidelines is that the company is one of the first US businesses to codify this power shift, with clear policies on the role of the board. The document covers 28 issues and on many of them GM follows policies which institutional shareholder activists lobbying for better corporate governance regard as good practice. It says the board should consist of a majority of non-executives - GM's company by-laws insist on this - and that they should make the decisions on matters of corporate governance. But one of the main problems which often face outside directors in challenging chief executives is a lack of leadership. GM solves this by having the non-executives select a 'lead director' to chair at least three of the special meetings a year of outside directors. When an outside director becomes chairman at GM - as in the case of Smale - the chairman is the 'lead director'. However, GM does not have a firm policy on whether the roles of chairman and chief executive should be split (though many corporate governance activists insist they should). The board, it says, 'should be free to make this choice any way that seems best for the company at a given point in time'. The guidelines also say all directors should have 'complete access' to GM's management, rather than routing inquiries through the chief executive, and the board should receive in writing information 'important to its understanding of the business' in advance of its meetings. 'As a general rule, presentations on specific subjects should be sent to the board members in advance, so that board meeting times may be conserved and discussion time focused on questions that the board has about the material.' The board should be responsible 'in fact as well as procedure', for selecting its own members (rather than leaving this to a chief executive, who might fill positions with his friends). GM has also established a committee of director affairs, which is responsible for assigning board members to its various other committees (such as audit, public policy and compensation). It must also report annually on the board's performance, and review areas of the business where it could make a better contribution. Once a year the outside directors must evaluate collectively the performance of the chief executive, and their opinion will help the board's compensation committee set pay for the position. The chief executive must report to the board annually on succession planning and management development. The guidelines specify no fixed-term limits for being a director - which some shareholder activists demand - on the grounds that this would reduce their contributions and their experience in the job which gives them particular insights into the company. Instead, the committee of director affairs will review each director's position on the board every five years. The guidelines also avoid a ruling on whether former chief executives should be allowed to remain on the board, saying that this is a matter to be decided in each individual instance. That may disappoint some shareholder activists, though most will find much else to cheer about in the GM code.</p>

			<p><P> July 25, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AND THEN THERE WERE 2 AND FINALLY 1 -- SOUTER;  </P> <P> COURT: NOMINEE SELECTED OVER TEXAS WOMAN PRIMARILY FOR HIS LACK OF 'PAPER  TRAIL' ON CONTROVERSIAL ISSUES.  </P> <P> In the end, the decision came down to two candidates and one issue.  </P> <P> The candidates were David H. Souter of New Hampshire and Edith H. Jones of  Texas. And the issue, according to officials involved in the process of picking  the next justice of the Supreme Court, was not abortion, but politics -- did  President Bush want an ideological war or a smooth, non-disruptive confirmation  process.  </P> <P> The 68-hour-long process of picking a successor to retired Justice William J.  Brennan Jr. began with a flurry of telephone calls Friday night. It ended with  a simple meeting Monday in Bush's private study, where the President offered  the lifetime appointment to Souter.  </P> <P> In between, Bush and top aides winnowed a list of potential nominees to eight,  then four, then finally to two. Souter's intellect, particularly impressive in  one-on-one meetings, was a persuasive factor, Bush aides said. But even more  important was his lack of a "paper trail" on controversial issues that would  have opened the way for a long and rancorous confirmation fight.  </P> <P> The key event, according to officials familiar with the process, was a  90-minute meeting Sunday night with Bush and four advisers in the White House  residential quarters. Earlier that day, four candidates had been in the running  -- Souter, a former New Hampshire Supreme Court justice who was appointed to  the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals earlier this year; Jones, a conservative  judge on the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, who sits in Houston; Solicitor  Gen. Kenneth W. Starr and federal Appeals Court Judge Laurence Silberman in the  District of Columbia.  </P> <P> Silberman and Starr are based in Washington. The other two had been summoned to  the capital by White House counsel C. Boyden Gray, who had reached them by  telephone Sunday afternoon.  </P> <P> But as Bush and his advisers began the evening meeting, the President quickly  knocked first Starr, then Silberman off the list, White House officials said.  </P> <P> Then, Bush turned to Vice President Dan Quayle, Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh,  White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu and Gray and divided them into teams  to argue the merits of the two remaining candidates.  </P> <P> Quayle and Sununu were told to make the case for Jones, while Gray and  Thornburgh were given Souter. The cagey maneuver neutralized both Sununu's own  personal fondness for Souter, whom as governor he had appointed to the New  Hampshire Supreme Court, and the strong pro-Jones bias of some members of  Gray's staff.  </P> <P> For more than an hour, the two sides argued as Bush took notes. Naming Jones,  the conservative favorite, would be "a strong 'in your face' political  appointment," Quayle and Sununu argued, according to an official familiar with  the process.  </P> <P> By contrast, Thornburgh and Gray counseled Bush that "there would be other  times to do that, a better time to appoint Jones or someone like her," the  official said.  </P> <P> Or, as another White House official put it, "the President is likely to have  another appointment" given the age of several members of the high court. "Maybe  the second time around you'll see a 'hotter' nominee."  </P> <P> "The next couple of months, when the confirmation hearings will take place,  will be right smack in the middle of an election cycle," the official said. A  major confirmation fight at that point, particularly one waged over the  emotional issue of abortion, "could have thrown things out of whack."  </P> <P> "There was a desire to move quickly and in a non-disruptive way, and the way  you can do this is with an extraordinarily impressive candidate who has a  relatively thin" paper record on the most controversial issues, a senior  Justice Department official explained.  </P> <P> Souter was that candidate. By contrast, Jones has been for several years a  favorite speaker at meetings of the Federalist Society, an association of  conservative activist lawyers whose members have provided many of the young  judicial clerks and Justice Department and White House special assistants who  charted the conservative path during the Ronald Reagan Administration.  </P> <P> Jones also had written a number of judicial opinions that contained a notably  conservative tone and rhetoric, although she had no clear statements on  abortion in her file. Silberman was also considered a conservative activist and  one whose reputation for temper has worried officials in the past.  </P> <P> Starr, the government's advocate before the high court and an early favorite  for the job, was viewed as less ideological than Jones. But he did have a clear  abortion stand attached to his name.  </P> <P> Last year, Starr had been directed by the Administration to file a brief with  the Supreme Court urging the justices to overturn Roe vs. Wade, the 1973  decision that made abortion legal in the nation. His obedience now came back to  haunt him -- Bush feared that Starr's name on that brief would have "ensured  that abortion would be center stage," said one senior official.  </P> <P> For the White House, the process began at roughly 7:30 p.m. Friday when two law  clerks from Brennan's office arrived with the justice's letter of resignation.  Bush was on Air Force One flying back to Washington from an afternoon of  fishing in Wyoming. And by the time Sununu contacted him with the information,  the news already was on television, radio and news wire services and had  reached the plane.  </P> <P> Bush directed Sununu to convene a meeting early Saturday morning with Gray and  Thornburgh -- Quayle was at Bethesda Naval Hospital with his wife, who was  undergoing surgery -- to begin a process that had been carefully prepared  months in advance.  </P> <P> When the process began, Thornburgh and Gray presented Bush with an extensive  series of files that their staffs had drawn up summarizing the legal writings  and other statements of potential nominees. An Administration source said that  the President "got the whole spiel," a sharp contrast with former President  Reagan, who allowed his aides to largely select nominees for him, only getting  involved to formally offer them the job at the end.  </P> <P> After the meeting with Bush, the senior advisers met again to continue  winnowing down the list to a shorter, eight-person slate. Jones was the only  woman on that "short list," according to officials involved in the process. The  list also included one black judge, Clarence Thomas, a colleague of Silberman's  on the federal appeals court here, and one Latino, Judge Ricardo Hinojosa of  Texas. The President "had a high view" of Hinojosa, said a participant in the  process.  </P> <P> One by one, as Bush reviewed the candidates, names were crossed off, officials  said. Finally, Sunday afternoon, Bush told Gray to call Souter and Jones to  Washington.  </P> <P> Souter was in his judicial office in Concord, spending a mild, sunny Sunday  afternoon indoors reading law. Shortly after Gray reached him, he called his  longtime friend and political mentor, Sen. Warren B. Rudman (R-N.H.), who had  gone home from Washington to his home state.  </P> <P> " 'You can tell nobody this but I've just talked to the White House legal  counsel, Mr. Gray, and they've asked me to come to Washington, and I suppose I  should,' " Rudman later recalled that Souter had said.  </P> <P> "I said: 'What do you mean you suppose you should?' "  </P> <P> " 'Well,' he said, 'there are a lot of wonderful judges in this country, and  I'm sure the President must know them personally, and, you know, I don't know  the President, I've never been involved in politics. Why would he want me?' "  </P> <P> "You pack a suitcase and I'll pick you up," Rudman said he responded.  </P> <P> Rudman drove Souter to the Manchester, N.H., airport, stopping along the way at  an ice cream store. The senator got ice cream while Souter, true to his ascetic  image, drank a cup of coffee. At the airport, the senator lent his friend some  cash and put him on the plane. He flew coach.  </P> <P> Jones, meanwhile, was flying north from Houston.  </P> <P> As Bush met with his advisers to debate the merits of the two candidates  Sunday, White House aides met them separately at the airport. The White House  was reluctant to have either candidate spend the night at a hotel for fear that  word they were in Washington would leak out. But Souter, who is virtually  unknown in Washington, had nowhere to stay because Rudman was still in New  Hampshire. White House aides arranged for him to spend the night at the home of  an Administration official.  </P> <P> The next day, Gray interviewed Souter, satisfying himself that there were "no  skeletons" in the judge's closet. Souter was asked a series of questions.  </P> <P> Then, at 1:30 p.m., after Bush had concluded a meeting with the visiting  president of Ecuador, Souter was ushered into the White House residence, where  he met with Bush for 45 minutes. Aides had prepared a list of questions for  Bush but the President had crossed two off because he felt they were too close  to asking about specific issues -- an approach that he had decided to avoid,  the senior official said.  </P> <P> Jones met with Bush next, in the Oval Office, while Souter waited down the hall  in the office of Deputy White House Chief of Staff Andrew H. Card Jr.  </P> <P> Bush finished interviewing Jones about 3 p.m., officials said. As Jones and  Souter waited in the White House West Wing, Bush pondered six pages of notes,  written in longhand, on which he had listed the candidates' pros and cons. Of  Souter, he had written: "He's a scholarly man . . . he has a good education . .  . he has been recommended by legal authorities . . . he has a good record in  lower courts," said the senior official, adding that he had never seen Bush  prepare such an extensive memorandum to himself.  </P> <P> Then, at 3:30, Bush called his spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, to the Oval Office,  told him he wanted to make his court announcement that day and asked how much  time he had to make up his mind. Fitzwater -- with an eye on news media  deadlines -- suggested a decision should be announced by 4:30 p.m. Bush said he  needed an extra half hour.  </P> <P> At 4:15 p.m., Bush called Fitzwater again, told him he had selected Souter,  gave him the nominee's biographical information, and asked where Souter was  waiting. While an aide informed Jones that she was not the choice, Bush  escorted Souter into his personal study.  </P> <P> Staff writers James Gerstenzang and Paul Houston and Washington Bureau Chief  Jack Nelson contributed to this story.  </P></p>

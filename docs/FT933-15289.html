			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Arts: The self-destructive demolition man - Art Exhibitions The art world has a hunger for self-destructive heroes and Gordon Matta-Clark, famous for sawing buildings in half, and son of the surrealist painter Roberto Matta, seemed a perfect example of a dubious stereotype. He was dead at 35. I approached the retrospective of his work which now fills London's Serpentine Gallery prepared to be cynical, but came away impressed. For it is ultimately not the daring of the famous set pieces - where the artist cut away whole sections of buildings, revealing and articulating the unseen spaces within - that is so striking, but the underlying seriousness and consistency of approach that Matta-Clark brought to all of his work, from the smallest drawing to the grandest project. The exhibition repays careful attention, and indeed requires it, as many of the pieces on show are photographic records of projects or sketches and notes for activities. There is also a comprehensive video programme, well worth seeing for a glimpse of the New York loft scene as well as the drama of the artist in action, power saw in hand, making his inimitable 'cuts' through the abandoned buildings of the New York environs or the tenements of Paris. Matta-Clark was one of the artists living and working in Manhattan during the 1970s who sought a wider agenda for their activities than that defined by the writings of Clement Greenberg, who insisted on the separateness of different art forms and the primacy of abstraction. Their generation was anxious to break away from the concept of a pre-eminent form or formula for art, seeking inspiration through cross media experimentation. Matta-Clark, trained originally as an architect, questioning and innovative by nature, embodied this principle as well as being an active participant in the group discussions and collaborative works, which embraced painting, sculpture, dance, theatre, film and video in an attempt to expand not just the form but the content of artistic activity. These young radicals wanted art to be about life, and to live in New York at that time was to experience a great conurbation in crisis, a metropolis that seemed to have lost its sense of identity. The most obvious manifestation of this malaise was urban decay. Huge tracts of the city in areas such as the South Bronx and Lower East Side stood derelict, the buildings scarred by fire. Matta-Clark began to work in these environments, places where courage was required just to walk down the street. 'I made a series of visits to . . . ghetto areas . . . cutting away rectangular sections of the floor or walls to create a view from one space into another. The sections were . . . removed from their original positions and taken to an art gallery.' As Dan Graham put it: 'Matta-Clark used houses and building structures which were about to be demolished and created deconstructed 'ruins' which reveal hidden layers of socially concealed architectural and anthropological . . . meaning.' One of the most satisfying of these was done not in New York but in Paris. 'Conical Intersect' was made for the Paris Biennale of 1975. The exhibition includes photographic, film and videotape records of the piece, which involved removing a large section of wall, floors and ceilings from two 17th century tenements standing next to the skeletal form of the newly-rising Centre Pompidou. Filmed from across the street, chips of stone first begin to fly from the ancient wall, as if a huge chick was struggling to break free from the blackened stone. Then a great slab falls away, revealing the hard-hatted figures of Matta-Clark and an assistant through the sizeable hole their hammers and saws have wrought. They continue to work, removing floor supports and sections of internal wall to create a spiralling curving shape, the abandoned space becoming a living sculpture before our eyes. Its final destruction was effected by bulldozer immediately the project was finished, which the film also shows. Watching, the difference between creation and destruction becomes clear. Matta-Clark's intervention, by recognising and revealing for the last time the principles of its construction, gave the ancient building one more flash of life before 'progress', the one certainty of city existence, brought about its end. Seen from a distance of 20 years, Matta-Clark's work, and some of the activities with which he was associated, have a curious innocence. The festivals and performances, the discussions and debates, the communal artworks addressed serious social issues in a spirit of celebration. But things change. 'That was before the drugs,' as one former participant remarked. It was not drugs but cancer that killed Gordon Matta-Clark. It is hard to imagine what he might have been doing now, and sad that he is no longer bringing his energy and inventiveness to bear in an art world which some feel has once more withdrawn into its own concerns, further removed than ever from engagement with those profound social contradictions which he explored with such elan.

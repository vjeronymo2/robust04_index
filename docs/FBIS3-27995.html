			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 2 KYODO -- Easing of rules on companies  buying their own stock, a measure long sought by business and  securities circles to reinvigorate the stock market, could be  implemented as early as this year, according to a proposal made  by a government advisory panel on Wednesday [2 February]. The  government will include the step in a package of emergency  pump-priming measures to be announced Thursday.    Companies have so far been virtually banned from buying back  their own shares. The easing will allow companies to buy their  own stock from the secondary market, thus soaking up the shares,  which are in abundance since the late 1980s, and hopefully  activating the stock market.    Conditions under which companies will be allowed to own  their  own stock include buying with the intention of later discarding  the shares, or selling them off to their in-house employee  shareholding organizations after the acquisition.    The Legislative Council, an advisory body to the justice  minister, is expected to submit a report on the revision of the  commercial law on February 16, enabling the justice minister to  present the proposal to the current Diet session. The proposed  amendment will allow companies to make buy-backs if they get  approval at their regular shareholders' meetings.    The current law requires approval from all shareholders, a  requirement that has proved virtually impossible to fulfill.    Companies will be restricted from buying back more than the  amount set aside for payment of stock dividends.    When they buy with the intention of selling off the stocks  to  their in-house organization, the upper limit to their purchases  will be 3 percent of the outstanding shares.    They will be required to sell off the shares within six  months. An extension of the six-month period will be allowed if  the in-house organization does not have the necessary funds to  buy the stocks.</p>

			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Solicitors warned against 'sharp practices' on fees A FEW solicitors are using what amounts to sharp practice by substantially increasing their original fixed fees in small cases, a representative of the lord chancellor said yesterday. Mr John Taylor, parliamentary secretary at the Lord Chancellor's Department, regretted that solicitors were not required to inform clients of the likely costs of taking on a case and the basis of charging. Mr Taylor said at the Law Society's Oxford weekend conference: 'For the small client - probably someone who will go to the solicitor only once in a lifetime and that once because they have to rather than because they choose to - the profession too often asks, as it were, for a blank cheque.' He said it was crucial for ethical standards to have a place in solicitors' business. Mr Taylor referred to a few cases where clients were encouraged to enter into a fixed-fee arrangement which 'somehow becomes inappropriate and is replaced by a much more substantial fee'. In other cases a low-cost service was offered which was so poor it led to continued problems and further ex-pense. 'Tales such as this smack of sharp practice rather than of professionalism. They also do a disservice to the profession as a whole,' he said. He thought the Law Society's remuneration certificate procedure - which allows clients to challenge solicitors' bills without further costs - was a 'valuable safeguard'.</p>

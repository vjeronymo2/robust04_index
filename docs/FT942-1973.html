			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Russians to sign military security pact with Nato Russia will today end nearly six months of uncertainty by signing up to the Partnership For Peace, the military co-operation programme designed by Nato. Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, will also set in motion a broader co-operation arrangement between Russia and Nato, whose precise formulation was being haggled over by diplomats in Brussels until late yesterday. The Russian side has stepped back from some of its bolder demands over the wording of the broad agreement. However the very fact Nato has been prepared to negotiate a separate deal to supplement PFP is a substantial concession by the alliance. The supplementary agreement will state that Nato and Russia have an important contribution to make to the security of Europe, and it will call for long-term co-operation between Moscow and the alliance, both inside and outside PFP. It will call for political consultations and an exchange of information on European security. Negotiation was going on until the last moment over whether the text would contain an explicit reference to Russia's importance as a nuclear power; and also whether it would envisage - as Russia has suggested - that the two sides formally co-ordinate their peace-keeping activities.</p>

			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Government is accused over Hess records SENSITIVE information about the abortive peace mission by Rudolf Hess, Hitler's deputy, to the UK in 1941 is still being witheld by the government, it was claimed yesterday. That was in spite of the release yesterday of official records about Hess's mysterious arrival in Renfrewshire and his subsequent captivity. The issuing of documents was part of the government's efforts to reduce enduring official secrecy over Hess's flight to the UK. The documents included an apparent suicide note addressed to his family in Germany a month after his arrival. The letter, together with a similar message to Hitler, was written in June 1941 while Hess was being interrogated by government and intelligence officials at Mytchett Place near Aldershot. Hess's letter to his family - in which he wrote despairingly, 'As I am forced to end my life' - was confirmed yesterday by his son Mr Wolf-Rudiger Hess. The scrawled letters to Hitler and to his family - addressed as 'My Dear All' - were referred to in a biography of Hess by Mr Peter Padfield that was published last year. But Mr Padfield confirmed yesterday that this was the first time the letters themselves and their content had come to light. The four pages of letters were the only new documents brought to light in yesterday's release of about 900 pages of microfilmed documents on the Hess case by the Public Records Office. Other records published yesterday had already been known to historians for several years, having been released through other channels. Mr John Costello, a former television producer who has pioneered research into Hess's story using Soviet and US archives, complained that the government was still withholding sensitive material. Mr Costello said it was 'ludicrous' that information was coming out from the files of both the US and the former Soviet Union that was still unavailable in Britain. Mr Padfield produced evidence in his book, Hess - Flight for the Fuhrer, that Hess had been the victim of an elaborate decoy plot by British intelligence. A 'double-cross' team had lured Hess to Britain by nurturing his hopes of agreeing a deal with supporters of appeasement in the British establishment. Of yesterday's documents, Mr Padfield said: 'What is interesting is what is not there.' He said he was 'quite convinced' that details of the MI6 plot against Hess were contained in intelligence files separate from the UK Foreign Office files now being opened to the public. The MI6 files would remain secret after all the remaining Foreign Office files on Hess were due to be released in the next few weeks, Mr Padfield said. Mr Hess junior, speaking from near Munich, maintained his claims that his father, who died in Spandau fortress in Berlin in 1987, was murdered by the British authorities. He called for full disclosure of the circumstances of his father's flight to Britain. 'This would please the family as well as the historians,' he said. 'If it seems as if the British government is hiding something, this is negative for Britain.'</p>

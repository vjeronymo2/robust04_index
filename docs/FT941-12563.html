			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Darwin a natural selection Sir, Answering the request from Malcolm Rutherford to nominate the most important figure in history ('The greatest person who ever lived. . .perhaps', January 15/16), readers of the FT omitted the name of Charles Darwin. His discovery of natural selection was more important for human development than all the discoveries and inventions which took place during the lifetime of the modern world.

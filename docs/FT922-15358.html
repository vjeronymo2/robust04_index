			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / UK Company News: The fall into disgrace after a meteoric rise - The career of the energetic chairman of Control Securities THE ARREST of Mr Nazmu Virani casts another shadow over the future of Control Securities, the property, leisure and pubs group which he built up. It emerged yesterday that UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the finance house, had resigned as adviser to the company. However, City analysts believe that, unless hitherto unsuspected black holes are uncovered, it should survive. Although Mr Virani has been the driving force behind the group's rapid expansion, he has established effective operating managers who are capable of ensuring that the group's trading performance is maintained, analysts say. The City's view of Control Securities has inevitably been coloured by Mr Virani's high profile leadership. His rise since he arrived in Britain with one suitcase as a refugee from Idi Amin's Uganda in 1972 has been meteoric. It aroused suspicions that he was travelling too far, too fast. He bought a supermarket in Dulwich, south London, and built up a chain of supermarkets and hotels. In 1976, he bought into a soft drinks manufacturer and turned it round. He tried to do the same at Belhaven, a Scottish brewery, becoming chairman in 1984, but he sold it two years later. In Uganda he had run a property empire - and it was to property he turned again in 1985 when he bought into Control Securities, then a near bankrupt Welsh group. He transformed the group, reducing borrowings and acquiring property in return for paper. He dealt with some of the biggest operators in the field - John Ritblat, Tony Clegg, and Gerald Ronson - buying 'good rubbish' from their portfolios. In 1988, he picked up the Belhaven brewery again and started to build a large pub estate around it. He bought pubs from Brent Walker and Grand Metropolitan to create an estate of nearly 800 outlets mainly in Scotland, the north of England and the Midlands. The brewery makes six brands of its own beer and undertakes contract brewing for Scottish &amp; Newcastle and Bass. By 1989, Mr Virani was also developing the hotels side of the business. Bass sold 27 hotels in Spain to a company in which Control had recently increased its stake from 50 per cent to about 75 per cent. In the UK, the group owns a number of hotels including showpiece establishments in London, Folkestone, and Llandudno. Mr Virani's evident pride in his progress - capped by the award in 1990 of Asian Businessman of the Year - did little to allay concern about the speed of it. The fund-raising efforts in which he became involved saw him mixing with royalty, politicians and other leading social lights. The City generally remained unimpressed; but Heron Corporation had taken a 16 per cent stake in his company, and GrandMet was happy to accept 9m shares in part payment for its pubs. Five years of growth, in which Mr Virani had earned 100th place in the rank of the UK's richest people, with a family fortune estimated at Pounds 80m, ended with the collapse of the property market. The first shock waves of that had scarcely been absorbed before the collapse of BCCI - one of Control's bankers, a 5.5 per cent shareholder, and the occupant of two of its buildings. A Pounds 3.8m provision was made against the exposure. But neither sentiment nor the share price had recovered before dealings were suspended last October after detectives from the Serious Fraud Office raided the company's head office. Since then, Control has reported pre-tax figures for the six months to last September of Pounds 4.38m, nearly Pounds 10m down. The empire remains largely intact - about 100 properties including offices, shops, industrial and residential premises, 24 hotels, the brewery and 800 pubs. Only one property, in Kensington, London, appears to have been sold, for Pounds 2.5m. The group's debt stands at about Pounds 260m but rents and leisure profits were covered, though only just, at the interim by rents and leisure profits. Its banks have continued their support. Though the property market remains difficult, the group's leisure side, with an improved contribution from its Spanish hotels, lifted interim profits 52 per cent to Pounds 11.5m. Analysts rated that a sound performance, and see no reason why it should not continue. Mr Nazmu Virani was remanded in custody for a week after appearing before City of London magistrates yesterday, charged in connection with the BCCI investigation. Mr Virani is charged on one count of conspiring with Mr Mohammed Moizul Haque and others to present false accounts to the value of Dollars 4m (Pounds 2.3m) to Price Waterhouse, BCCI's auditors. It is alleged that the accounts misleadingly showed that BCCI was owed the money by three companies: Duffleland, Impactlight and Virani Group UK.</p>

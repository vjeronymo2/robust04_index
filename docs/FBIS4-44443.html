			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Li Puyou (2621 2528 2589), vice minister of the </F> State Nationalities Affairs Commission: "Nationality Propaganda  To Help Solve Minority Problems"]    [Text] Nationality propaganda work is an important part of  the party's propaganda work as well as a key component of  nationality work.    Nationality propaganda work must be guided by the principles  underlying the party's propaganda work and carried out in  conjunction with the reality in minority-inhabited areas and the  conditions of minorities. Nationality propaganda work shares  some common features with the party's other propaganda work but  also has its own special content and characteristics. In  nationality propaganda work, therefore, we must neither deviate  from the party's propaganda work as a whole nor overlook the  special content and characteristics of this particular kind of  propaganda work. Only by integrating the two closely can we put  nationality propaganda work on a sound footing.    We must steadfastly publicize the Marxist view on minority  nationalities and the party's nationalities policy and religious  policy, paying special attention to the "Regional National  Autonomy Law." Autonomy in regions inhabited by minorities is  the product of the marriage between basic Marxist tenets and the  reality in China and a great achievement of the CPC. Practice  proves that autonomy in minority-inhabited areas is consistent  with the circumstances in China, has withstood any test, and has  been embraced by the people of all nationalities in China. At a  time when nationalism is on the rise in some places in the  world, causing endless wars and turmoil, minority regions in  China are politically and socially stable and enjoy steady  economic growth. This fully demonstrates the superiority of  China's socialist system. We must put the publicizing of the  "Regional National Autonomy Law" at the top of the agenda and  make it work all the time.    Grasp the opportunity and take pains to guide minority  nationalities and minority-inhabited regions to correctly  understand and handle the disparities left behind by history.  Disparities in economic development are an objective fact, the  result of a host of historical and geographical factors. Since  the 3d Plenum of the 11th CPC Central Committee, the  minority-inhabited regions have been developing rapidly  economically, but not fast enough to prevent the gap between  them and developed areas from widening. Should we limit  ourselves to economic development disparities in all our talk  about disparities, or should we look at the gaps in ideology and  thinking as well? In my opinion, we should begin by identifying  the ideological gaps. Once we discover where the minorities have  fallen behind ideologically, we will have located the crux of  the problem and the driving force of development. Successful  ideological education is an important part of uniting everybody  to further economic construction. Minority-inhabited regions and  minority nationalities must be constantly guided to deepen their  understanding of the principle put forward by the CPC: "Liberate  thinking, seek truth from facts, unite to forge ahead, open up  new territory, and strive for success"; to summon the courage to  think, act, experiment, and break new ground to the extent  objective conditions allow; and to further economic growth  endlessly and gradually narrow the gaps, ultimately achieving  the objective of common prosperity.    The CPC Central Committee and State Council have always  taken  the economic gaps between minority-inhabited regions and the  rest of the nation seriously. To accelerate economic development  in minority-inhabited regions, a string of preferential policies  and measures have been taken, which have proved remarkably  successful. Propaganda work has been highlighting this aspect,  but the effort has been relatively superficial, not in-depth or  solid enough. Therefore we need to publicize the party's various  preferential policies and measures thoroughly and tell the  masses about the party's moves in this area so that everybody,  every household knows about them. That way cohesiveness is  enhanced and people become united in striving for economic  development and social progress. Not only is this enormously  significant domestically, but internationally too it will speak  volumes.    Routine nationality propaganda work must touch upon issues  of  greatest concern to the masses and succeed in dispelling doubt  and providing correct guidance. Right now we find ourselves in  the new situation of building a socialist market economy. In the  wake of the development of a market economy, the masses are most  concerned about how the various interests would be adjusted. We  must do a good job in nationality propaganda work, targeting  ideological understanding of relevance to the masses.    Since reform began and the open policy went under way, the  national economy has been growing in a sustained and steady  manner and living standards have widely gone up. This is mainly  why people of all nationalities support reform and the open  policy. The purpose of reform and the open policy is to enable a  majority of people to secure more tangible benefits. If the  living standard of the people in other regions of the nation  goes up while minority regions and minority nationalities  benefit little, still lagging in economic development, then  reform and the open policy will have been a failure. If this  issue is not resolved properly, there will be contradictions and  unrest, with undesirable consequences.    Comrades involved in nationality work are bound by duty and  obligation to face up to this sensitive issue, doing a good job  in a focused way and with a confidence borne of the knowledge  that justice is on their side and minimizing any factors that  may potentially cause contradictions and unrest.    "Equality, unity, and mutual aid" is the basic principle in  socialist nationality relations. Nationality propaganda must  always take this theme seriously. The inter-nationality  relationship in old China was one of political oppression and  economic exploitation. There was simply no equality worth  mentioning in internationality relations. Under the CPC's  leadership, people of all nationalities have abolished the  unequal relationship of the past and established a brand-new  nationality relationship. To solidify this relationship, we must  publicize national unity and national progress even more so that  even minorities feel and experience the warmth of the extended  family of nationalities. Although the economic and social gaps  bequeathed to us by history still remain, they can be bridged  through hard work. To close the gaps, we must, first of all,  understand correctly and analyze closely their basic causes. We  must then make the most of the resource and locational  advantages of minority-inhabited regions. Third, we must instil  the idea of self-reliance and the notion of hard struggle.  Fourth, we must build up confidence. It takes meticulous,  detailed, thoroughgoing, and painstaking propaganda and  ideological work that is also specific, lively, and fully  convincing to achieve all of the above. Publicize the concept of  the "two inseparables" widely and in depth. The "two  inseparables" is a product of history. The Chinese nation is a  unified collection of multiple nationalities. Although there  have been splits as well as unions over the years, unity has  always been the dominant trend. This proves that the 56  nationalities are interdependent and that they spur each other  on in the interest of common development, not only politically,  but also economically and culturally. The pattern of nationality  distribution is characterized by intermingling among the various  peoples. The army of cadres is also multinational. In terms of  religion, several nationalities may subscribe to one religion,  or one nationality may practice several religions. When it comes  to daily habits and customs, the nationalities have common  features as well as differences. When they diverge, they display  their respective uniqueness. Their similarities are the result  of the various nationalities learning from, emulating, and  influencing one another. The above description shows that the  "two inseparables" have deep roots. Widely and thoroughly  publicizing the concept of the "two inseparables" and the notion  of the various nationalities "breathing the same breath and  sharing the same fate, their hearts beating as one" has enormous  significance for handling internationality relations properly.    Publicize the customs of minorities in light of the  developments in real life. National customs are closely  interwoven with national characteristics and national  psychology. Together they help a nationality survive and thrive.  However, they can be a negative factor under particular  circumstances, perhaps even to the extent of impeding the  nationality's development. Here nationality propaganda workers  have a big job on their hands, and a difficult one too. If  mishandled, it would lead to thorny problems. Concentrate on  guidance. Put equal emphasis on continuation, refinement, and  innovation. Vigorously but cautiously do a good propaganda job  to transform social customs.    Handle correctly the relations between the nationalities  policy and the religious policy in terms of propaganda.  Nationality issues are "flash points" in the world today while  religious issues are "sticky points." "Flash points" and "sticky  points" are often intertwined, vastly complicating nationality  propaganda work. We must have a good understanding of the links  and differences between the two. Strictly differentiate between  their respective policy limits. Conduct propaganda energetically  but cautiously.    In conducting nationality propaganda work, one must not only  consider the domestic situation, but also study the political,  economic, and cultural conditions in neighboring countries in  earnest. On the one hand, over 30 out of the 55 minority  nationalities in China have as their neighbors people of the  same nationality living in another country. On the other hand,  as part of reform and the open policy and modernization, every  nationality needs to know the world better and let the world  understand itself better. This presents nationality propaganda  work with a real and serious issue. People living in border  areas have multiple and wide-ranging ties with the neighboring  countries. The contacts and interactions across the border have  a broad impact. The only way to do a good job in ideological and  political work and instill in border residents a sense of  national pride is to study the political, economic, and cultural  conditions in neighboring countries regularly and make  propaganda work more proactive.    As for national separatists at home and abroad, we must try  to understand their motives, familiarize ourselves with their  methods, and expose them at an opportune moment when we know  exactly whom to go after. Educate the masses to keep up their  vigilance and see through the separatists' plots so that they  will not be taken in or duped. Instead, they should take a  clear-cut stand and fight back.    And then there is the tiny handful of people who try to fish  among troubled water. They should be treated on a case-by-case  basis. Step up the propaganda offensive to win over public  opinion. Take advantage of contradictions to divide and  demoralize, winning over the majority while isolating and  cracking down on a handful of people. Properly used, negative  teaching materials would be even more effective and successful  in turning negative factors into positive ones and educating and  uniting the vast majority of the people.    Intensify external nationality propaganda. Some Western  nations, particularly hostile forces in the world, years ago  adopted the "peaceful evolution" strategy toward China and are  still practicing it. Unwilling to see China develop in leaps and  bounds, they try in every way possible to infiltrate and carry  out separatist and subversive activities. Taking advantage of  the surge in nationalism around the world more recently, they  have been working in collusion with some of the Chinese national  separatists who have fled overseas to stir up trouble using the  nationality and religious issues. We must maintain sharp  vigilance against them and combat them in a reasoned manner,  backed up by evidence, with the party's nationalities and  religious policies. Propaganda work on this front must be done  just right in intensity, extent, and timing. The last thing we  should do is to give others a handle against us.    The primary targets of nationality propaganda work are  cadres, intellectuals, and young people. Cadres in this context  refer not only to cadres in minority-inhabited regions, but also  to cadres elsewhere, particularly leading cadres at all levels.  "Once the political line is set, cadres become the decisive  factor." When a cadre understands the circumstances of a  nationality and has a good grasp of the nationalities policy, he  will be free from short-sightedness and more conscientious in  his execution of the policy. Furthermore, he will be able to  practice in earnest what he advocates, thereby influencing and  leading the masses. These days old cadres are giving way to new  ones. Some of the newly promoted cadres are not familiar with  the nationalities policy and nationality theory. They lack a  general knowledge of the nationalities and have little  understanding of the principles of and tasks in nationality  work. So the need is even more compelling for them to study  harder. Han cadres in minority-inhabited regions must immerse  themselves among the local masses to comprehend their conditions  and master local customs and languages. Communicating in a  minority language is more effective in bridging the gulf and  promoting goodwill and friendship. Cadres in non-minority  regions also should be well versed in the party's nationalities  policy.    Avoid and eliminate the kind of damage that may be done to  the feelings of minority nationalities by an ignorance of local  customs. Use models to help push nationality propaganda work  forward widely and in depth. "The power of models is boundless."  "Light one lamp to illuminate a large area." Be adept at  discovering models, nurturing them and publicizing them. Use  models to further nationality work and enhance the impact of  such work. The first national unity and progress commendation  meeting was convened by the State Council in 1988. The second  commendation meeting will be held this year. All provinces,  autonomous regions, and municipalities directly administered by  the central government will also be holding similar gatherings.  Treat the process of selecting advanced national unity and  progress collectives and individuals as part of the great cause  of furthering national unity and progress. It is a good method  and should be regularized and institutionalized.    Even more important, we must discover models in a timely way  in our daily work, review the experiences, and popularize their  exemplary conduct promptly. The idea is to introduce a constant  parade of models without interruption. This is an important tool  that would help us do a good job in nationality propaganda work.    Mobilize the initiative and enthusiasm of publishing,  literary, and artistic units for participating in nationality  propaganda work. "There is no minor issue in nationality and  religion." Furthermore, a number of problems have arisen in the  past few years concerning the way the media portrayed the  nationality issue in their reports and the way literary and  artistic units dealt with it in literary works, on TV, and in  movies. Still haunted by these events, the above-mentioned units  tend to shy away from reports and creations involving a minority  nationality, hurting the effort to make nationality propaganda  more widespread and multimedia. In the course of time, nobody  will dare touch this subject and it will become a taboo, which  would only hinder the development and progress of the entire  Chinese nation. We must fire the courage of propaganda workers  and literary and artistic workers to participate in nationality  propaganda work through an active use of such media as the  newspaper, literature, and art. At the same time, they must be  given assistance in selecting topics carefully and handling  sensitive matters properly. When the issue in question is  uncertain, do not decide for yourself. Instead, explore it from  a variety of angles and at all levels and consult with others.  In short, the army of people in the media, in literature, and in  art have something going for them--they have wide-ranging  connections and wield much influence. Make the most of those  characteristics.    Handle the problems that arise in nationality propaganda  work  carefully. Nationality propaganda work involves major policy  issues. It embraces a broad area and touches upon many fields.  Meanwhile, comrades engaged in nationality propaganda work are  constrained by a variety of factors, including the limitations  of their own professional knowledge. Hence the mistakes and  misjudgments in nationality propaganda work and the consequent  problems. Problems must be analyzed by looking at the specific  facts in a particular case. When errors occur in the course of  nationality propaganda work because of the misapplication of the  nationalities policy, when problems arise in the publicizing of  national customs due to ignorance, education is the answer.  Workers who deliberately hurt national feelings and sow discord  among the nationalities must be held accountable. Those who act  bureaucratically and irresponsibly, thereby making errors in  their work, must be dealt with sternly.    Be adept at dissolving the contradictions in  internationality  relations. Cadres engaged in nationality propaganda work should  also pay attention to those contradictions. Once contradictions  and problems occur in internationality relations, nationality  propaganda work must serve as a catalyst, working out  differences, providing correct guidance, breaking down barriers,  removing contradictions, promoting understanding, and enhancing  trust. Accordingly, we must take pains to accomplish the  following. First, abide by the party's nationalities policy.  Second, understand and respect the government departments'  resolve to mediate disputes as well as their methods of dispute  mediation. Third, analyze the specific causes of such  contradictions. Fourth, carry out propaganda in a timely,  precise, and thoroughly reasoned manner, resting on firm  grounds. Distinguish between the internal and the external.    Nationality propaganda work must focus on mobilizing the  initiative of the masses. When all is said and done, propaganda  and ideological work entails mobilizing hundreds of millions of  people to fight for the interests of the country and nation as  well as their own interests. Nationality propaganda work is no  exception. Accordingly, this requires us to tell the masses  about the party's principles and policies, explaining the need  for and feasibility of such principles and policies by relating  them to the interests of the masses. We must explain that only  by operating in accordance with the party's principles and  policies will society be stable, the nation progress, the  economy develop, and the masses be able to improve their living  standards. Once they see the light, the masses will work hard on  behalf of the principles and policies on their own initiative.    Dualism must be adhered to in nationality propaganda work as  well. On the one hand, we strive for stability. On the other  hand, we pursue development. Stability provides a sound  objective environment for reform and development. It serves the  interests of reform and development. Reform, in turn, promotes  stability. When the economy and society thrive and when the  masses see progress and profit tangibly, their sense of  responsibility as master in control of their own destiny  enhanced, stability will be the winner. The two are  complementary and both are indispensable.    Nationality propaganda work must stress methods. Firmly  adhere to guidance and enlightenment. Avoid drilling hard and  fast rules into people's heads. Draw upon materials in real life  and refine them into a theory. In explaining the party's  nationalities policy, we must make the minorities feel that it  was formulated with them in mind, that it is highly relevant to  them and feasible and that it would benefit them if implemented  in earnest. Once the party's policy is implemented, progress  will be solid and development will come about rapidly.  Otherwise, development will be delayed and living standards  would not go up, causing unnecessary losses. Only by publicizing  the party's policy--a profound thing--in simple terms can we  achieve practical results.    Nationality propaganda work must adhere to the materialist  dialectical method. Stick to the doctrine that everything has  two aspects and steer clear of metaphysics; this is one method  that works in all we do. Be careful to do a good job in  nationality propaganda and ideological work from all angles. The  general principle is to tell the truth, report the facts, and  talk about the problems as well as the achievements. When we  talk about achievements, be restrained. When we talk about  problems, don't go overboard. In publicizing models, we should  emphasize the facts and not exaggerate so as to project a sense  of objectivity, truthfulness, and trustworthiness. This will  make propaganda work more effective and influential.    Nationality propaganda work must stress diversity and guard  against imposing a single policy across the board. China is a  unified multi-national country. To publicize the party's theory,  line, principles, and policies among 56 nationalities,  particularly the 55 minorities, we must take into consideration  each nationality's special characteristics, the differences in  their respective natural, economic, cultural, and historical  circumstances, the differences in their psychology and their  tolerance threshold, and the differences in the frequency and  extent of their contacts with other nationalities in China as  well as the outside world. We must also be aware of their  occupational differences and go about our propaganda work in a  focused way.    We must put the construction of facilities for nationality  propaganda in its proper place in the overall strategic plan.  For historical reasons, most minority-inhabited areas are  located in mountains, on highland, and along the border. They  are not easily accessible by means of transportation and are cut  off from information. Newspapers and magazines have a hard time  getting there or do so only after a long time lag, when news is  no longer news. Radio and television penetration rates are much  lower in minority-inhabited areas than in the rest of the  nation. Moreover, most minority nationalities still use their  own languages as the tool of communication, so even if they have  access to radio, television, newspapers, and magazines, there  remains the insurmountable language barrier. In contrast,  minority-language radio and television broadcasting originating  in neighboring countries can be picked up in many  minority-inhabited areas along the border. If this state of  affairs continues, its negative effects can be imagined. We must  face up to reality and make the construction of nationality  propaganda facilities a top priority. Be willing to invest in it  in order to put an end to the current conditions and meet the  needs of the new situation.    Go out of the way to solve the practical problems in  nationality propaganda work. Currently news and propaganda units  in minority-inhabited areas are plagued by widespread problems  having to do with manpower and material and financial resources.  Backward tools and fund shortages severely constrain the  launching and development of nationality propaganda activities.  The news-gathering activities and literary and artistic  propaganda organized in recent years have been a big boost to  nationalities work. However, the remoteness and inaccessibility  of minority-inhabited areas presents reporters and literary and  artistic workers with numerous difficulties and prevents them  from doing their job on a regular or permanent basis. As far as  these problems are concerned, we have to depend on nationalities  commissions at all levels as well as artistic and literary  organizations to summon up their spirit of self-reliance and  arduous struggle to overcome problems and, circumstances  permitting, do a good job in nationalities propaganda work.  Meanwhile, governments at all levels must understand the  difficult position nationality news and propaganda departments  are in and help them work out their practical problems.    Work hard for the leadership and support of propaganda  departments. Nationality propaganda work is an important part of  propaganda work. It is essential that propaganda departments at  all levels step up their leadership and support. The  nationalities commission should initiate regular contacts with  the propaganda department to keep it informed of the situation.  It should submit to the latter's leadership voluntarily and work  hard to win its support. For their part propaganda departments  at all levels should consider nationality propaganda work part  of their responsibilities and take it seriously, making plans  comprehensively and carrying them out in stages step by step.  Implementation is one area that calls for an aggressive effort.    Rely on the strengths of news units. News and propaganda  units have a nation-wide presence. The army of news workers  constitutes a vital new force on the ideological front; they are  politically sensitive, have a high professional caliber, and are  familiar with the party's propaganda work. Making a success of  nationality propaganda work is inseparable from this army. Put  it to the fullest use. First, respect the news workers, Second,  provide leads for their news-gathering and propaganda. Third,  make it easier for them to gather news. Go out of the way to  solve the problems and difficulties they encounter in  news-gathering.    Utilize to the fullest the army of news and propaganda  workers in the nationalities commission system. The  nationalities commission system has developed a formidable  propaganda contingent with years of experience in nationalities  work, including some who are members of minority nationalities.  Take advantage of their strength--their knowledge of  minority-inhabited areas and minority nationalities--and  mobilize their initiative and enthusiasm for serving the  minorities and minority-inhabited areas to conduct nationality  propaganda extensively and in depth. No doubt the news and  propaganda (including publishing) units of our system were  created rather late, lack the necessary wherewithal, and are not  well connected. They also operate under more institutional  constraints than other news and propaganda units. Moreover, most  units are not financially self-sufficient and belong in the  category of subsidized institutional units. For these reasons,  therefore, we must make the deepening of internal reform a  priority, straighten out relations, strengthen unity, improve  the conditions in which they operate, and map out a new path of  development.    Accelerate the build-up of the army of propaganda cadres in  nationalities commission organs. That army of cadres is small in  size but has much work to do, including a lot of coordination  tasks. We must pay sufficient attention to this army, instead of  considering it expendable or its size unimportant. We must rely  on it to strengthen guidance over nationality propaganda work  and the implementation of the plan, using it as a bridge to  reconcile the external with the internal. In this sense, this  army is vital, so vital that it must be strengthened, not  weakened. It must be amplified depending on the real  circumstances in the unit in question. Take pains to nurture  news and propaganda cadres in order to facilitate the completion  of nationality propaganda tasks in the new era.</p>

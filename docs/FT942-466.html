			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / Housing policy changes 'essential' Changes in housing policy are essential to support the labour market flexibility needed to improve the UK's competitiveness, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation says today, John Willman writes. The social research organisation says in a report that home ownership, the government's preferred form of tenure, is unsuitable for people whose income fluctuates or who must make frequent job moves. Flexible employment practices are bringing more frequent job changes, less security of employment, greater mobility and increasing fluctuations in household income, the report says. Home-ownership imposes extra costs on those required to move. It is easier for those with fluctuating incomes to rent, rather than buy, the report says, since people on low incomes qualify for housing benefit. The report warns that a further drive to increase home ownership could destabilise the housing market and damage the economy. More must be done to create a balanced housing market. It recommends continuing to phase mortgage interest tax relief, grants to private landlords to encourage renting and more help for those in mortgage arrears. The report warns that negative equity, mortgage arrears and repossessions remain persistent problems, especially in the south of England. A Competitive Economy: the Challenges for Housing Policy.

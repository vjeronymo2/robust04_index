			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / Taiwan-China links urged by shipping chief Mr Chang Jung-fa, chairman of Taiwan's Evergreen Group, has called on the Taiwan government to 'separate politics from economics' and open direct shipping and air links to China, saying Taiwan's economic future hinged on direct ties. In a rare interview published yesterday in the Chinese-language Commercial Times, the founder of one of the the world's biggest shipping companies and Taiwan's first private international airline voiced the frustration of Taiwan's business sector at being forced to route trade and investment through Hong Kong. 'A few years ago, virtually all of China's trade went through Hong Kong, and Evergreen was able to compete with other companies,' Mr Chang, who has heretofore refrained from publicly opposing government policy, was quoted as saying. 'Now shipping firms from all countries are setting up bases and routes to the mainland, and Evergreen has to rely on Hong Kong alone.' He also warned that, because of Hong Kong's reversion to Chinese sovereignty in 1997, Taiwan must face up to and resolve the problem of direct links. 'If not, when the time arrives, not only will there be problems with flights to Hong Kong, there will also be problems with shipping to Hong Kong,' he said. In a country where business leaders exert exceptional influence on government policy, Mr Chang's remarks are a clear sign of growing pressure on the government to address the question of direct links to China. Taiwan has formally banned direct political and economic ties since 1949. There are sharp divisions within government ranks over the question of cross-strait shipping and air links, with three cabinet ministers advocating their speedy resumption on the grounds that such a move is necessary for Taiwan to remain economically viable. On Monday, Mr Vincent Siew, chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and Development, the top planning agency, told Prime Minister Lien Chan that direct links were key to the realisation of Taiwan's oft-stated ambition of becoming a regional centre for business and finance. Taiwan's existing five-year air rights agreement with the colony expires on April 30 next year. Talks between Taiwan's China Airlines and Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific Airways to renew the agreement appear to have broken down. Hong Kong newspapers reported on Monday that Beijing was insisting on having a final say on any new air rights agreement with the colony extending past 1997. Mr Chang wants his airline, EVA Air, founded in 1991, to fly to China's main cities and is trying to gain access to the lucrative route between Taipei and Hong Kong, currently dominated by CAL and Cathay. Taiwan has invested an estimated Dollars 15bn (Pounds 9.7bn) in China since the early 1980s and some 12,000 Taiwan companies have set up operations in China.</p>

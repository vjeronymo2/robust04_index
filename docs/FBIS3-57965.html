			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Ciampi Consults With Parties"] </F>   [Text] Rome, 4 Jan (ANSA) -- Premier Ciampi concluded his  first day of meetings with parliamentary groups this evening and  continues his consultations Wednesday morning [5 January] at  0900, conferring with the Greens, Refoundation Communists, the  MSI [Italian Social Movement] Neofascists, the Rete (Network),  the SVP [South Tirol People's Party], and the Union Valdotaine.    Today he met with delegates for the Socialists (PSI), the  Christian Democrats (DC), the Liberals (PLI), the Social  Democrats (PSDI), the European Federalists, the Democratic Party  of the Left (PDS), the Northern League and the Republicans  (PRI). The forces which have upheld the government so far (the  DC, PSI, the PSDI and the PLI) have not ruled out the  possibility of Ciampi continuing with full powers until general  elections are held, possibly in conjunction with European  elections in June.    The PDS, however, considers the political life of this  government over and insists that the parliament must be renewed  as quickly as possible.    PDS secretary Achille Occhetto told reporters at the end of  his meeting with Ciampi that "in our view, starting with January  12, any time is good for the president of the republic to  dissolve the two houses." The essential thing is to hold  elections so as to give life to a new parliament from which a  new government can emerge, Occhetto said.    Flanked by PDS caucus leaders Massimo D'Alemo and Giuseppe  Chiarante, Occhetto told the press that during the approval of  the financial bill, the government had effectively carried out  the function for which it was created, that is, as institutional  guarantor, and also absolved this task with the approval of an  electoral reform which reflects the spirit of the referendum, he  said.    For the PDS, it is wrong to open a debate on the government  when the impelling job ahead must be that of enabling the  citizenry as quicky as possible to choose a new parliament  elected under the new rules.    League floorleader Roberto Maroni also urged speedy  elections, no later than 10 April, and the sooner the better.    The League did not preclude the Ciampi Administration  staying  on until the vote as long as it did not prove to be an  "electoral executive" remote-controlled by any particular clutch  of political forces but rather, but instead served to  technically manage certain economic problems. The League will  decide its stance on the no-confidence motion after hearing  Ciampi's address to the parliament.    For the Republicans the filing of no-confidence motions was  unacceptable because the government had adequately handled the  tasks before it. The PRI takes the view that the no confidence  ploy was devised as a way to prolong the life of the legislature  when the approval of the new electoral law urges the renewing of  parliament as soon as possible.    In fact, the focus of today's meetings was chiefly on the  date for the coming general elections and the nature of the  government handling the period leading up to the vote. Almost  all the groups voiced appreciation for the job done by Ciampi.</p>

			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: India struggles to cover shortfall in jute crop The Indian jute mill industry is trying to organise the import of fibre from all possible sources in a desperate attempt to improve the supply of raw jute. According to traders, Indian mills have so far been able to buy nearly 250,000 bales (180kg each) from Bangladesh. But as that country suffered a major setback in jute production this season it is not in a position to meet the full Indian import requirement. The Indian mills are, therefore, exploring the non-traditional markets like Vietnam and China, according to industry officials. One mill has already imported 15,000 quintals (equivalent to about 3,800 bales) of jute from Vietnam and says that further imports will be made from that source provided that 'the quality of the first lot is found satisfactory'. 'We have received quotations for the Chinese jute from some Singapore-based traders,' it adds. 'The Chinese jute, which is equivalent to our benchmark grade TD-5, has been offered at about Rs220 (Pounds 4.70) a quintal higher than the prevailing Indian price. The mills have to decide whether it is desirable to import Chinese jute at the rate of Dollars 34 a quintal,' says an Indian Jute Mills Association official. The fact remains, however, that neither Vietnam nor China has much surplus jute for export. The Indians have drawn a blank in Thailand which has itself become a jute importer. But they will be able to buy some fibre from Nepal, according to industry officials. Federal government officials now admit that the agriculture ministry was wide of the mark in August when it made a jute crop estimate of 7.4m bales for the 1993-94 season (July to June). According to Mr SS Chattopadhyay, jute commissioner, 'the crop in the current season could turn out to be less than 6.5m bales.' The trade maintains, however, that the crop is not more than 6.2m bales. Last season India produced 7.4m bales of jute. Because of the crop failure, the prices of raw jute, particularly of the better varieties, have hardened considerably. The TD-5 grade is quoted at about Rs840 a quintal, compared with Rs440 in January last year and Rs619 at the commencement of this season. According to the IJMA, which has estimated a crop of 6.5m bales, total availability of fibre during 1993-94 will be 8.66m bales, including opening stocks of 1.86m bales and imports of 300,000 bales. But as annual consumption of fibre by the mills is about 8m bales and the non-mill requirement about 550,000 bales, end-season stocks will be insignificant. The Indian jute season begins in July, but the crop arrivals do not start gaining momentum until about the middle of September. 'The industry faces a big crisis whenever the opening stocks are less than 1.8m bales', say industry officials. According to IJMA officials, about 24 of the country's 73 mills have 'very low stocks of jute'. The growers have already sold their jute and, anticipating a further rise in prices, the middlemen have cornered a good quantity of fibre. So the weaker mills, which constitute the greater part of the industry, are finding it increasingly difficult to buy jute at the current prices. According to the industry officials, the jute commissioner will soon be required to invoke his powers under the jute control order to fix the maximum prices of fibre, put a limit to the stocks of jute that a mill may maintain and also regulate the industry's production. Otherwise, as has been seen in the past years of crop failures, there will a random closure of mills.</p>

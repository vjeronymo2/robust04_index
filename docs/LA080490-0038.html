			<p><P> August 4, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DANCE REVIEW;  </P> <P> SOVIET NAVY TROUPE SAILS INTO WARM RECEPTION  </P> <P> Fifty Soviet sailors will be singing and dancing around town this week. But  this group won't be doing it just for fun. They're participating in a series of  tightly orchestrated outdoor public performances in San Diego and Coronado.  </P> <P> The 50-member Soviet Song and Dance Ensemble of the Pacific Fleet, and the  Soviet band that accompanies it, sailed into San Diego Tuesday morning, just  one component in a historic visit by three Soviet navy vessels to this  once-forbidden territory.  </P> <P> They performed Tuesday night at a private party sponsored by the Chamber of  Commerce at the U.S. Grant Hotel. And they moved Wednesday to Sea World for a  noon show.  </P> <P> Before the Soviet ships leave Saturday morning, this vivacious troupe will have  appeared for one-hour performances Thursday and Friday at the Organ Pavilion in  Balboa Park. They will also have presented two-hour shows Thursday evening at  San Diego State University's Open Air Theatre and Friday evening at Tidelands  Park in Coronado.  </P> <P> What is a musical troupe doing in the company of Soviet military on this  landmark visit to San Diego?  </P> <P> "Music and art are very good for helping us understand each other," said Col.  Nicholay Bessubchenco, a Soviet public relations officer, said.  </P> <P> "Such contacts bring about peace and harmony."  </P> <P> Various cultural presentations are typical during official military visits by  any nation, Cmdr. Cheryl Duft, the U.S. Navy's local liaison for the Soviet  ensemble, said.  </P> <P> "That's the nature of these official visits. When U.S. ships go to  high-visibility foreign ports, we have bands along doing the same thing. But  the Soviets traditionally take song-and-dance troupes as well, to give people a  chance to learn something about their culture," she said  </P> <P> "An exchange of ships is a very big deal," Anatoley Kalekin, leader of the  Soviet troupe, said through an interpreter. "This is one way to embellish  that."  </P> <P> "We have a good cross-section of ethnic forms, but the company's primary  charter was to provide entertainment for the troops," Kalekin said.  </P> <P> On those terms -- as pure, hands-across-the-sea entertainment -- the  song-and-dance troupe succeeds. And, as Adm. Gennadly Alcksandrovich Khvatov,  commander of the Soviet Pacific Fleet, said laughingly in a pre-show interview,  the performers show American audiences another side of the Soviets: "We can  recreate and rest too."  </P> <P> Tuesday's preview performance at the U.S. Grant was part of a reception for  local and visiting dignitaries, and the performance was somewhat limited by a  stage too shallow and cramped to provide a proper showcase for such a large  ensemble.  </P> <P> Time constraints prevented the group from presenting its full program. Even so,  the performance was reminiscent of another military-based song-and-dance  ensemble -- the Red Army Chorus, which brought San Diego audiences out in  droves last year.  </P> <P> The Red Army Chorus, which is 200 hundred strong, dished out Russian-style  razzle-dazzle and bits of Americana in a glitzy, show-biz package. For them,  Ethnic authenticity was less important than flaunting bravura style and  fostering international harmony.  </P> <P> The naval equivalent of the Red Army group proved to be similar in spirit,  though a lot more modest in scale. Tuesday's concert, which lasted 75 minutes,  ran the gamut from traditional Soviet ethnic songs and dances, to patriotic  military displays and standard American tunes. The latter clearly had been  added to the troupe's repertory as a token of friendship.  </P> <P> In full-length performances Thursday and Friday, the Soviets emphasized  full-bodied dancing and cultural diversity, of which Tuesday night's show gave  just a sampling.  </P> <P> The show displayed that Soviets are interested in U.S. culture.  </P> <P> The singers performed the troupe's own version of "Home on the Range," "Hello  Dolly" and "The Man I Love." And, like the Red Army, this troupe also had the  crowd in rapture with a rousing chorus of "God Bless America," before bounding  into a busy finale that packed the stage with costumed performers.  </P> <P> The most successful piece on Tuesday's program was a contemporary, comic dance  routine satirizing military life. Both the Soviets and their American hosts  were quick to see the humor of brow-beaten sailors swabbing the decks and doing  other necessary but unrewarding housekeeping chores.  </P> <P> A phalanx of male dancers stopped the show in its tracks when they came on --  in perfect unison -- imitating a set of gears in a well-oiled machine. Only  this machine kept bogging down, just when the frustrated mechanic thought he  had solved the problem to get it running in high gear.  </P> <P> Of the few pure ethnic dances on the program, the flashy show of martial arts  and sword play done by men wielding wicked-looking lances and sabers was the  most thrilling and kinetically satisfying.  </P> <P> Despite the cramped space, a band of agile men flung themselves into  mock-combat, then followed with a series squatting kicks, tumbles, spread-eagle  jumps and other traditional Cossack-style maneuvers to wild applause.  </P> <P> Six women are included in the dance ensemble. They never got a chance to shine  on Tuesday's program, although they kept popping up in different costumes, from  ancient ethnic wear to chic sailor suits. The singers and musicians, some  playing ancient instruments, fared better. They were given several  opportunities to shine, and they had the audience clapping along merrily to  their lusty seaman songs more than once.  </P> <P> Judging from the rafter-raising reception the Soviets got from this audience of  about 600, San Diegans are right in tune with the Soviet military's brand of  entertainment. And the enthusiastic Soviet song-and-dance troupe was obviously  just as happy to be performing their first concert here.  </P> <P> At the close of the concert, the singers intoned warmly to their audience:  "Dear Friends, let us be just good friends."  </P></p>

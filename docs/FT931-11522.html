			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Driven to a grinding halt: Daf is the biggest victim of the sharp contraction in the European truck industry The war of attrition in the European truck industry claimed its biggest casualty yesterday when Daf, the Anglo-Dutch commercial vehicle maker, was forced to file for protection against its creditors in the Netherlands. The vice is tightening inexorably. The number of truck makers in Europe had already dropped from 25 in 1975 to 10 by the end of 1991, and the group is still shrinking. Financially Daf has been the weakest of the leading European truck makers, but it has tried hard to compete in the industry's premier league. Its financial collapse will send shock-waves through a sector that is already being battered by deepening recession. Daf is the biggest truck maker in the UK - since its takeover of Leyland vehicles in 1987 - and it is the UK truck market leader with a share of 25 per cent. It is number six among the big seven European truck makers with a share of close to 8 per cent of the west European truck market. Its single biggest shareholder is still British Aerospace with a stake of 10.9 per cent resulting from BAe's takeover of Rover, formerly British Leyland, in 1988. The BAe holding has fallen sharply from an original 40 per cent, however, and BAe failed to subscribe to the last share issue in late 1991, further diluting its then stake of 16 per cent. But as Daf's problems have mounted it has been the Dutch institutions that have increasingly answered the distress calls. More than 40 per cent of the equity is now in the hands of the biggest Dutch bank, ABN/Amro (8.2 per cent); VADO, controlled by the founding Van Doorne family (10.3 per cent); the Dutch insurance groups ING (10.6 per cent) and Aegon (6.4 per cent); and DSM, the former Dutch state-owned chemicals group (5.9 per cent). How the administrators and receivers in the Netherlands and the UK will seek to pick up the pieces remains unclear. Daf insisted yesterday that its attempt to engineer a financial rescue had only foundered on the opposition of a minority of its banks, mainly in the UK, to its proposals for securing emergency short-term funding. With Dutch financial institutions facing the biggest financial exposure, and the Dutch and Belgian governments having shown themselves willing earlier in the company's decline to support restructuring packages, the Dutch administrator might still be able to work out a new rescue. For the moment, however, Daf has given up control of its own destiny. Having run up cumulative losses of about Fl 800m (Pounds 300m) in the past three years, it was forced to file for protection from its creditors at the district court of s'Hertogenbosch. Its operations were immediately plunged into uncertainty and upheaval. Employees turned up at the company's plants in the UK, the Netherlands and Belgium for work as usual, but within hours production was being affected. As news of the financial collapse spread, some suppliers began to stop deliveries of components. With just-in-time delivery of parts to plants spread from Leyland in Lancashire to Eindhoven in the Netherlands, the impact of such actions on the assembly process can be almost immediate. 'Where possible we are producing, but in some areas supplies of components have stopped. What happens tomorrow, I don't know', said one Daf executive in the UK. As Daf's fortunes have waned, it has proved unable to find a rescuer within the industry, despite desperate overtures in recent months to Mercedes-Benz, the automotive subsidiary of Daimler-Benz of Germany and the world's biggest truck maker. It has also searched in vain in recent months for a Japanese partner. The absence of a partner is not surprising. Daf's competitors have enough troubles of their own. Volvo, Renault and Iveco (the commercial vehicles subsidiary of Fiat) are all losing money on their truck and bus operations. In the US the heavy truck industry has been deep in loss for five of the past 11 years. In Japan the truck market has been falling for more than two years. Nissan Diesel fell into loss in the six months to the end of September, while Hino, the leading Japanese heavy truck maker, suffered a 59 per cent fall in pre-tax profits in the same period. The fortunes of the truck makers fluctuate wildly as the industry suffers from exaggerated trading cycles. In west Europe the last year of strong growth was 1989, the year that Daf went public. European truck sales have been falling for the past three years, and there is little prospect of relief during 1993 with demand forecast to fall particularly sharply in Germany and Italy. Each lurch downwards in the trading cycle claims new victims, and Daf has long looked most exposed. Its financial demise has abruptly ended its brave dream of becoming one of the leading players in the European truck industry, able to challenge the likes of Mercedes-Benz, Iveco and the Franco-Swedish alliance of Renault and Volvo. Its strategy for climbing into the top flight started with the takeover in 1987 of the then British Leyland truck and van operations. The move transformed it from being essentially a heavy truck and bus maker into a commercial vehicle producer with a full product range from vans to light, medium and heavy trucks and buses. Buoyed by record sales and profits in 1989 it then tried to add to Leyland by taking over the Steyr truck business in Austria, and then Enasa, the Spanish state-owned truck maker of Pegaso vehicles. Each time it was thwarted by bigger rivals - first by the German truck maker MAN, in the case of Steyr, and then by Iveco at Enasa. Even as these dreams of grandeur were fading, Daf began to be overtaken by the impact of the UK recession - one of the principal reasons for its downfall. The UK became its biggest single market after the merger with Leyland and by 1991 the UK still accounted for 29.4 per cent of group sales. In 1991 it ousted Iveco from the leadership of the UK truck market and it consolidated its pole position last year. But market leadership has been small consolation, when overall UK truck sales have fallen to their lowest level since the early 1950s. In the past three years, the number of trucks sold in the UK market has declined by more than 50 per cent, from 69,234 in 1989 to only 31,398 in 1992. Daf has tried hard to reduce its dependence on the UK by expanding its dealer network and sales overseas - in particular in Germany and in France. But other markets have weakened too. Excluding the German market, which was stimulated for two years by the impact of reunification, the effects of recession have been savage. According to Mr Peter Schmidt, an analyst at the UK-based Automotive Industry Data, the west European truck market (above 3.5 tonnes gross vehicle weight), excluding Germany, has plunged from 255,000 in 1989 to 160,000 in 1992, the lowest level for at least two decades. Including Germany, truck sales in west Europe have fallen from 321,000 in 1989 to an estimated 281,000 last year. Now the prop of Germany is also falling away. Mercedes-Benz, the industry leader, has been forced to cancel a big investment in a new truck plant in east Germany, and has disclosed that since July it has suffered a 'dramatic' fall of 30-50 per cent in new commercial vehicle orders booked in Germany. Daf has had its own particular problems, however. It has been badly exposed by having the breadth of product range of the biggest manufacturers without their production and sales volumes. As a result, it has been unable to achieve economies of scale. But if Daf's problems have been exaggerated by its relatively small size, its rivals are unlikely to feel reassured. The problems of the European truck industry are likely to get worse before they get better. Some of Daf's larger competitors may also find themselves forced on to the hard shoulder before the end of the decade.</p>

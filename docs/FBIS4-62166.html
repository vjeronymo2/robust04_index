			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksandr Sychev report: "European Union Gives Us Two and </F> a Half Freedoms"]    [Text] European Union [EU] and Russian experts have  completed work on a draft partnership agreement that will be  discussed by the EU Council early next week at foreign minister  level.    This agreement is not identical with the accords that some  of  our former CEMA partners in East Europe have with the EU. The  Common Market agreed on free trade with them right away. Russia  represents an economy that is large for the EU, and Brussels  will not agree to harmonization with it without careful  consideration. Nevertheless a treaty with Russia is desirable  for Moscow. It provides a legal footing for trade and economic  relations with the EU.    The prepared draft constitutes an interim agreement. It will  operate until late 1997, when a decision is to be adopted on  whether it should be supplemented with a statute on free trade.  In its current form Moscow will receive two and a half of the  four freedoms operating with the EU -- freedom of movement for  goods, services, capital, and manpower -- namely freedom of  movement for services and capital, and the phased liberalization  of commodity exchange.    In the opinion of Foreign Ministry experts, the EU's  agreeing  to grant Russia the same advantages that other members of GATT  enjoy was a very important gain for Moscow. Through not taking  part in that organization Russia has often fallen victim to  restrictive measures introduced against its competitive goods.  Moscow will now obtain the right to demand observance of GATT  norms within the EU -- provided, of course, that it meets them  itself.    It only proved possible to make a breakthrough on two  problems that remained unresolved until recently -- Russian  exports of nuclear materials and the status of West European  banks in Russia -- as a result of contacts by telephone and fax  between Sir Leon Brittan, EU commissioner for trade, and  Aleksandr Shokhin, deputy chairman of the Russian Government.    Moscow insisted that there should not be deliberate  discrimination against Russian exports of fissionable materials  but encountered dogged opposition from Paris. France also  produces nuclear materials and is afraid of an influx of a large  quantity of cheaper Russian output. The compromise goes like  this: Moscow's demand has been met, but the EU reserves the  right to use commercial means to protect the market until the  term of the agreement expires, consulting with Russia on every  occasion.    As for Western banks, it has been decided that the Russian  president's restrictive edict will be abrogated in 1995.</p>

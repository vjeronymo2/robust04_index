			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / Query on Lloyd's contracts REINSURANCE contracts that have generated multi-million-pound losses for Lloyd's Names may be 'voidable', or invalid, according to evidence contained in a report by Rodney-Smith &amp; Partners, reinsurance consultants. The report was commissioned by Names - the individuals whose assets back underwriting at Lloyd's - who were members of syndicates managed by Rose Thomson Young and Gooda Walker agencies between 1988 and 1990. The syndicates reinsured the exposures of other Lloyd's syndicates to catastrophe losses and suffered badly as a result of several natural disasters and industrial accidents, including the Piper Alpha oil rig explosion. The report, which Rodney-Smith expects to complete in the next two to three weeks, was prepared after a legal opinion offered in October by Mr Gavin Lightman QC. Mr Lightman said the contracts might be voidable if they were entered into for reasons other than for the benefit of Names, and other parties to the contracts knew about that. The report provides some hope for more than 3,000 Gooda Walker Names who were told this week that they face a cash call of Pounds 101m for losses incurred during 1989 and 1990. Six months ago Gooda Walker Names received a bill for Pounds 137m for 1989 and 1990 losses. Direct response plan, Page 15</p>

			<p><P> June 19, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JOURNAL WILL PUBLISH ISOPRINOSINE STUDY  </P> <P> Newport Pharmaceuticals said Monday that a leading medical journal has agreed  to publish a study of the company's drug, Isoprinosine, in the fight against  HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.  </P> <P> The Laguna Hills-based company said it would release further details Thursday  at a press conference at the International AIDS Conference in San Francisco.  </P> <P> Newport stock has shot up 66% since Thursday and closed Monday at $2.8125 in  over-the-counter trading.  </P> <P> The article focuses on a Scandinavian study of 866 individuals infected with  human immunodeficiency virus, some of whom were treated with Isoprinosine. Some  19 of those patients contracted AIDS within a year, and of these, two were on  Isoprinosine while 17 were on placebos.  </P> <P> Newport Pharmaceuticals hailed the study as proof of the drug's merit in  combating HIV, but studies in the United States and the United Kingdom have  concluded that Isoprinosine is ineffective for that purpose.  </P> <P> The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has criticized the company in the past  for conducting incomplete tests on Isoprinosine and for improperly promoting  it.  </P></p>

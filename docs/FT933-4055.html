			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): Computers are all Ears for truancy As the school term begins again, students who are contemplating skipping lessons should beware. Teachers are now turning to computers to spot the truants. The electronic attendance registration system - Ears - is a computer tablet in a folder. Each time the teacher takes the register the pupils name is ticked off on the screen. This information is sent by radio to the central computer in the school office where it is collated. The system, developed by Bromcom Computers, can even write to the parents of missing pupils. Bromcom: 081 461 3737.</p>

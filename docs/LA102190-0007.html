			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RANCHO DELUXE;  </P> <P> ROOTED IN CALIFORNIA'S RUSTIC PAST, THIS STYLE OF FURNITURE HAS A BRIGHT FUTURE  IN THE COLLECTIBLES MARKET  </P> <P> When baby boomers were kids, a well-decorated, middle-class ranch house in  Southern California wasn't complete without a touch of the Wild West: a  wagon-wheel sofa or maybe bunk beds with cowboy-and-Indian-patterned spreads.  </P> <P> This faux cowboy chic has long been considered kitsch. But now collectors and  historians are re-evaluating the style and -- hold on to your hat, Roy Rogers  -- ranking a few California Rancho pieces with Craftsman collectibles. The  rustically romantic style began with the furniture for the adobe ranchos of the  area's earliest Spanish and Mexican settlers. Then, in 1915, a Spanish Colonial  architectural theme was selected for the Panama-California International  Exposition in San Diego. Fueled by an infatuation with the Hollywood Western as  well as the need to furnish thousands of newly built Craftsman and Spanish  bungalows, the style flourished.  </P> <P> Barker Bros. introduced California Rancho furniture in 1929. The designer,  George Mason, created the 120-piece Monterey line based on a photo of a settee  from the movie "Old Arizona," plus a few inspirational visits to the California  missions. This furniture, produced until the early '40s, is recognizable -- and  highly collectible today -- because early pieces were branded just like cattle.  </P> <P> Other furniture lines followed: Coronado by Angelus Furniture Co. (Barker  Bros.' biggest rival), Montecito, Forest, Ranch-o and La Fiesta. All the  furniture was sturdy, with roughed-up finishes to make pieces appear as though  they had been dragged overland. Some pieces were hand-painted and sported rope  seats and wrought-iron straps; many were branded or stenciled with designs  including horseshoes and palm trees. In 1988, the style gained legitimacy with  the Santa Monica Heritage Museum exhibition "Monterey: California Rancho  Furniture, Pottery and Art."  </P> <P> For a generation seeking both comfort and a sense of tradition, California  Rancho fills not only a nostalgic void: The furniture bears aesthetic  similarities to now-out-of-reach Craftsman pieces, and prices are rock bottom  in comparison -- say, $2,500 to $5,000 for a Monterey cabinet versus the  $363,000 Barbra Streisand paid for a Stickley sideboard in 1988. To appreciate  California Rancho, however, one must accept that it's not a pure vision but a  hybrid form. Fans such as collector Robert Smith don't mind. "If cowboys had  had furniture," he says, "this is what it would have looked like."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cowboy Chic  </P> <P> The island of cactus in the front yard of this unassuming 1947 tract house is a  hint: A superb collection of California Rancho lies within. Since their  childhoods, both Paul and Nancy Aguilar -- he's an electrician and she's a  nurse -- have collected Western memorabilia, and after moving into this  Whittier house seven years ago, they have continued to add to their bounty.  </P> <P> Quaint and colorful, the Aguilars' many collectibles are reminders of the  rugged frontier: Paul's hats (a Mexican sombrero, a Tom Mix Stetson and two  old, children's cowboy hats) rest easy but ready for action on the armoire in  the living room. A variety of playthings -- complete sets of Johnny West dolls  and Legends of the West dolls, a toy guitar, a Davy Crockett tray and a toy  fort with Cavalry-men figures -- decorate the solarium.  </P> <P> Elsewhere, videotapes of vintage cowboy movies, including "The Big Sombrero,"  starring Gene Autry, and "Lights of Old Santa Fe," featuring Roy Rogers, line  the shelves. A collection of William S. Hart books and an assortment of  dogeared 1930s and '40s magazines such as "Old Arizona Highway," "The Homes of  the West" and "Deserts" continue the Western theme.  </P> <P> "I grew up in an era when everything was Western," says Paul, whose favorite TV  shows were "Wagon Train" and "Rawhide." "On the weekend, my family would go for  a ride and picnic at Will Rogers' ranch. I remember running around and falling  in love with it. Here I am, 30 years later, with the same kind of furniture."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rustic Renaissance  </P> <P> Before Joel Shukovsky and Diane English, the Emmy-winning executive producers  of "Murphy Brown," moved into their early California Rancho Revival house six  years ago, it was decorated with avocado-green and harvest-gold carpeting and  unappealing grass-cloth wallpaper. What sold the couple and ended their long  real estate search (they had looked at 75 houses) were the fabulous "bones" of  the 1963 structure and its secluded location in the Santa Monica Mountains.  "I'm not a fan of big houses. I like houses that are sympathetic to the land,"  says Shukovsky of the rancho, which was built low to the ground and retains its  dark, earthy adobe color. "Whitewashing would have been too interruptive," he  explains.  </P> <P> Although Shukovsky and English initially decorated the house with modern  Italian and Bauhaus-style furniture, they began buying Mexican and  Western-style accessories. They were first attracted to Craftsman pieces, then  shifted to Monterey furniture because of its regional character and  appropriateness for the house.  </P> <P> "It was not my style at first," English acknowledges. "I'm much more a fan of a  neoclassic or eclectic-country look, but the more the house began to evolve  into an early California feeling, the more I began to warm up to it."  </P> <P> The house is now full of classic examples of trademark horseshoe-branded  Monterey furniture and serious California plein-air artwork such as Edgar  Payne's "Desert Clouds," which hangs over the fireplace. The handsome landscape  paintings are a polished counterpoint to the rustic furnishings -- a  sophisticated marriage of Old California and the West.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rancho Roundup  </P> <P> Robert Smith, a professor of art at Cal State Northridge, and Tobi Smith,  director of the Santa Monica Heritage Museum, originally intended to fill their  pedigree Craftsman house (designed in 1909 by Myron Hunt of Huntington Library  and Rose Bowl fame) with furniture from the Craftsman period. That is, until  celebrity collectors such as Steven Spielberg and Barbra Streisand entered the  market and pushed prices beyond reach. As Robert writes in the Santa Monica  Heritage Museum's catalogue: "Many of the people now buying Monterey might have  purchased Roycroft and Stickley had the price stayed within their budgets.  There are a lot of people interested in buying old furniture that fits in  Mediterranean- and Craftsman-style houses. When Mission furniture left this  eager market, the market found Monterey."  </P> <P> Though cost was a consideration, the Smiths found they actually preferred the  look of California Rancho furniture to that of Craftsman for their Ojai home.  The hand-hewn furniture, with its painted flowers and antique finish, better  suited the Western presence of their Craftsman interior, and it blended well  with the beams and front door, which had been painted in an Indian motif by La  Jolla architects Frank Mead and Richard Requa.  </P> <P> The Smiths bought their first Monterey pieces at the Old California Store in  Ventura; they also discovered La Fiesta furniture, perfect for the informality  of their enclosed sun porch. "It's a cheap substitute for Monterey," Robert  explains. Where Monterey pieces were painted by Mexican artisans and branded  with a horseshoe, La Fiesta furniture was merely stenciled and stamped with a  wagon drawn by a donkey.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Where to Find the California Rancho Look  </P> <P> Betty Gold, who opened Territory four years ago, combines Old California and  Western artifacts and plein-air paintings in a gallery-like setting; more than  100 20th-Century wool and cotton American Indian trading blankets line the  shelves. Territory, 6907 1/2 Melrose Ave.  </P> <P> Vicki Berkofsky's Hemisphere features handmade rugs, textiles, jewelry and  furniture. She spent the last 2 1/2 years developing Monterey reproductions  with six new crackle-paint finishes. The sofa runs $3,450; the armchair,  $2,200. Hemisphere, 1426 Montana Ave., Santa Monica.  </P> <P> Linda and Don Berman's Raffia offers Western memorabilia and furniture  (California Rancho and Pinecraft) and signed, limited-edition L.D. Burke  mirrors with cowboy inscriptions ($800 to $1,600). Raffia, 10250 Santa Monica  Blvd., Century City.  </P> <P> Gene Autry Western Heritage Museum stocks Thomas Molesworth reproductions --  pine desk with leather top ($2,500) and "Gunfighter" armchair ($875) -- plus a  '50s hand-tooled-leather chair (with bullet holes, $560). Gene Autry Museum,  4700 Zoo Drive.  </P> <P> Don Short and Dolores Fisher's Old California Store doubles as showroom and  home. Surrounded by California Rancho furniture and accessories (Mexican color  lithographs from the '30s, '40s and '50s; Mexican tourist kitsch and California  plein-air paintings; Bauer, Catalina and Pacific tile and pottery; wrought-iron  lamps, chandeliers and sconces), the two are credited with rekindling the  Rancho style. They also publish a newsletter and arrange field trips to such  shrines as Will Rogers' ranch and the Adamson beach house. Old California  Store, 1528 E. Thompson Blvd., Ventura.  </P></p>

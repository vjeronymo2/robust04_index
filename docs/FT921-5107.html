			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / Deutsche Aerospace may take stake in Fokker DEUTSCHE Aerospace, the aerospace arm of Daimler-Benz of Germany, may take a substantial stake in Fokker, the Dutch aircraft manufacturer, as part of a new regional jet programme. The move would have implications for the European regional aircraft market which is facing acute competition and is in need of restructuring. It would also shift alliances between European regional jet manufacturers scrambling to rationalise activities through new industrial partnerships. Fokker said yesterday it had agreed with Deutsche Aerospace to discuss a 'more intensified relationship' which would include, at least, co-operating in the launch of a new 70 to 80-seater regional jet in late 1994, the Fokker 70. Fokker said direct investment by Deutsche Aerospace in Fokker's share capital was also an option. In Munich, Deutsche Aerospace confirmed its talks with Fokker but said no agreement had been reached. Fokker plans a Fl 500m (Pounds 156m) share issue next month to boost its capital by 50 per cent. There was speculation yesterday Deutsche Aerospace could use the issue to invest in Dutch aircraft manufacturer. If Deutsche Aerospace takes up the entire issue, it would secure a 33 per cent stake in Fokker's expanded share capital. Analysts suggested Deutsche Aerospace might also buy out the Dutch government, which holds 32 per cent of Fokker, giving the German group control of Fokker. Deutsche Aerospace's Messerschmitt subsidiary already co-operates with Fokker by producing the fuselage of the Fokker 100 regional jet. If Deutsche Aerospace strengthens ties with Fokker, it could mark a significant shift in strategy which has focused on developing an 80 to 130-seat regional jet with Aerospatiale of France and Alenia of Italy. The German group appears reluctant to launch its Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.42bn) programme with France and Italy in the difficult regional airline environment. Instead, it is considering working with Fokker on the new 70-seater aircraft while supporting development by the European Airbus consortium of a smaller 125 to 130-seater derivative of the Airbus A320 twin-engine aircraft. Deutsche Aerospace holds a 37.9 per cent stake in Airbus. Like the Fokker 100, the Fokker 70 derivative will be powered by Rolls-Royce Tay engines. Short Brothers of Northern Ireland, part of Canada's Bombardier group, is expected to participate in the project.</p>

			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Management (The Growing Business): All change at the factory  -A DTI project to encourage innovation surprised companies with its success When Robin Enderby was phoned by the Department of Trade &amp; Industry to ask if his company would take part in a pilot programme intended to encourage innovation, he was sceptical. 'I detest red tape, bureaucracy, planning departments, consultants and banks,' says Enderby, chairman of Blow Moulding Controls, a Gloucestershire manufacturer employing nearly 50 people and with annual sales of Pounds 3m. 'I was very reluctant to get involved - I was the last guy in the world who wanted to know about it.' The DTI caller, Doug Ponsford, persuaded him that a company could be transformed by the programme's method of managing continual and incremental change. In consequence, Enderby's company was one of 12 in Gloucestershire to participate in the pilot, Profit from Innovation, funded by the county's training and enterprise council at a cost of nearly Pounds 50,000. At a DTI-sponsored seminar in Cheltenham last month, Blow Moulding Controls and five other companies reported back in such positive terms that the Tec, probably in conjunction with two other south-west Tecs, will fund another programme this month. It will also discuss teaching more trainers to expand the regional coverage, and the DTI innovation unit will shortly consider promoting the programme to Tecs on a national basis. The subject of the enthusiasm is essentially a simple concept. It aims to improve a company's competitiveness by involving its staff in identifying the need for innovation, and then in implementing the necessary changes. It was devised by Clive Jones of Mentra, an innovation management expert, and Paul Ryan of the consultancy Business Logistix. Jones told the seminar: 'In too many companies, change is an announcement from the managing director, 'As from tomorrow. . .'.' The programme consists of six sessions to teach techniques to senior managers on how to run staff workshops, followed by support visits to the company. A 'driver' in each workshop encourages a flow of ideas to identify threats and opportunities, while a 'scribe' uses flip charts to record these and also keeps discipline. Techniques include asking people to list all conceivable faults of a product, and then stimulating suggestions for putting these right. Another approach is to forecast 'supertankers' - such as social changes affecting a market - and 'blockbusters' - described by Jones as 'a supertanker that comes in a hurry'. All this sounds sensible but is it effective? Enderby said the package 'seemed to boil down to one massive questioning technique'. It had decreased his business's quality problems and increased profitability. 'By involving all the workforce, we had guys coming forward with lots of ideas - some of them very good.' One outcome was that his company had rethought its US marketing strategy. Derek Morris, chairman of DM Foundries, with 25 staff and a turnover of nearly Pounds 1m, had been as dubious as Enderby. 'We're plagued by consultants who think they know it all. But we were amazed.' His foundry worked in a difficult environment, in which many customers had gone bust, and staff thought they were used to problem-solving. But the workforce came up with 'tremendous' suggestions. In one example the cause of a rapid production drop in one section was resolved. AT Poeton, an engineering company with 100 employees and Pounds 3.5m sales, also suffered in the recession. 'We made considerable efforts to find new customers but we didn't do so fast enough,' Anthony Poeton, managing director, says. 'Turnover dropped as did the profit to sales ratio.' The package had made a tremendous difference. New markets had been identified and profit to sales improved. In contrast, success caused difficulties at Invertec, which makes transport lighting equipment. Charles Valentine, managing director, said its sales of Pounds 3m were up 100 per cent in two years. 'The main problem hit us earlier this year when our order book exploded and we weren't ready for it.' Invertec found the programme 'incredibly useful', he said. The company realised it had poor communications with its customers and internally. 'We needed to listen to what the shopfloor and junior management were saying. I used to have a plaque in my office saying: 'As managing director I'm entitled to my bigoted opinions.' I now listen to people and have thrown the plaque away.' One identified weakness was that Invertec's information technology was 'woefully poor'. The company was now investing in an integrated software package. The 'supertanker' technique had helped to analyse other issues such as the impact of transport air conditioning on its products. Brian Bennett, managing director of Plastex International, a recycling company with 35 people and a Pounds 5m turnover, said it too had rapidly expanded. When his telephone call came from Ponsford, he said: 'I was probably the most sceptical - I felt we didn't have time, and would it really benefit us.' But in the workshops, he said, there were 'staggering comments'. The management discovered, for example, that staff did not feel motivated by the bonus scheme - which has now been scrapped - and did not understand the business. 'The techniques improved our ability to identify problems and make decisions.' Productivity had risen and there was a different attitude by both management and shopfloor. Enderby voiced one concern, shared by others, about how to maintain the initial enthusiasm. Jones acknowledged not all companies gained equally  - for example, when management tried to institute big changes first, rather than small changes where employees could see immediate results. The attitude of the workforce was crucial. 'Some took to the programme immediately,' he said, 'but a lot were very, very suspicious and almost hostile. But once we started and the ice was broken, it went very well.'</p>

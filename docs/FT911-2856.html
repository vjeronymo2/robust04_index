			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / International Company News: Deficit at HK bank subsidiary MARINE Midland Banks, the troubled New York-based subsidiary of the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, has reported a first-quarter net loss of USDollars 72.3m, compared with a profit of USDollars 6m in the same three months last year. The result, which follows losses of Dollars 164.3m and Dollars 111.5m in the previous two quarters, was described as 'very disappointing' by Mr Geoffrey A. Thompson, president and chief executive. Additional domestic commercial loans had been classified as non-accruing, and there was a Dollars 109.4m provision for losses on such loans. The results mark a bad start to the year for the Hongkong Bank, which has been hit hard by losses at overseas subsidiaries in the UK, Australia, and the US. Last month it announced a 35 per cent fall in after-tax profits, to HKDollars 3.1bn (USDollars 398m) for 1990. Marine Midland expects further losses in the second and third quarters. These are expected to continue until the US economy, especially in the north-east, picks up. The bank's main problem is domestic loans, which are now failing in general commercial businesses as well as in real estate. The bank has been undergoing radical restructuring. Mr Thompson said yesterday that operating expenses, excluding restructuring and credit-related items, were 17.5 per cent lower than in the first quarter of 1990. Capital ratios remained 'well above' levels required under 1992 risk-based capital guidelines. The Tier 1 capital ratio at March 31 was 5.75 per cent, compared with 4.18 per cent a year earlier and 5.84 per cent at the end of 1990. Non-third world loan loss reserves were built to USDollars 590.4m.</p>

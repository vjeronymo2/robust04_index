			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Final offer for Wheway posted MCLEOD Russel Holdings, the paints producer and distributor which last month launched a hostile bid for Wheway, the struggling environmental group, yesterday despatched formal offer documents on its 1-for-10 offer to Wheway shareholders. The McLeod board said it believed that was in the best interests of shareholders, employees and creditors of Wheway that a rapid transfer of control was accomplished because Wheway was a 'company in distress'. Other interested parties had been aware of the 'For Sale' sign on Wheway since December 23 1992, and no other parties had announced an offer, McLeod directors asserted.</p>

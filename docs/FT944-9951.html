			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Arts: The sound service - Radio As my colleague Christopher Dunkley will bear out, when wearing his presenter's hat for Feedback, nowhere is the Senior Service (radio) more conscious of its dignity than on Radio 4. Listening numbers may be down but R4's public is passionately loyal and fiercely articulate. A weekend housebound with flu gave me a chance to realise how far Reithian gravitas is now concentrated in this station, more recognisably the old Home Service than Radio 3 is the once world-famous Third. Caviar to the general, possibly, but R4 is BBC Radio's flagship - middle-class, mature audience and all - whether the Corporation likes it or not. The endemic BBC faults are there, of course: you come across conceit and complacency, the cosy and the commonplace. Frank Delaney's French Lit series, Journeys to Imaginary Places, told us little about Flaubert or Colette but much about Frank Delaney, his schoolboy French and his patronisingly unremarkable perceptions. Kaleidoscope too often trawls the dowdy reaches of outer academe to produce non-confidence-inspiring 'experts', too often massaged by the breathily bland Natalie Wheen. Serious programmes can be hijacked by frivolousness, as in last Saturday's Today. Tony Banks MP, mystifyingly regarded as a wag, witlessly gibbered about lavatory bowls in an otherwise intriguing item on the black economy in domestic work. His attitude boiled down, dismayingly, to an apparent blend of paranoia and old-fashioned snobbery, incomprehensible to any continental European. But at least Radio 4 reminds us of the union of which we are part, unlike the bulk of British popular culture that operates under the impression that we are the 51st state of a union lying in another direction. Saturday's regular Europhile is a jewel in R4's treasury. The test of a station's quality lies in its normal output, the basic programmes, taken for granted. Saturday's Money Box has won the Bradford and Bingley Award for the best programme on personal finance on radio or TV. File on 4 took a trenchant look at the one in eight of the working population now self-employed. Analysis (Sunday) examined how the appeal of communitarianism (yes, the word exists) cuts across political boundaries, both left and right endorsing the philosophical clout of 'the community'. George Walden warned of apple-pie pietism, an imagined Betjemanesque suburbia or idealised working-class. It looks as if the community may survive in an age of mobile phones, dormitory suburbs and kids who play with computers not one another: rather chillingly, people will not have friends any more, they will have networks. They will also have the media. Sunday's Mediumwave still falls between too many stools. A report from Italy on the trial-by-journalism of the murderous 'monster of Florence' was the sort of item infinitely better done by the excellent From Our Own Correspondent. Mediumwave is still presented by a media lady not too hot on interviewing, taking cues or reading a script (her reference to Mrs Kenneth Clarke's 'matronly bum' for 'bun' has passed into radio history). Radio 4's strengths extend to the quirky, the off-beat. Alan Cox's reading of Barry Pilton's Chocolate Nuns and Firebombs (Saturday) cheerfully evokes Paris in 1968 when it was bliss to be alive and to be young was very exhausting. Dylan Winter continues his Sunday teatime adventures with his barge and horse, sturdy Molly, meeting positively Dickensian canal-side folk. Last week he came across the farriers' closed shop (can't tighten a nail in another smith's shoe) and a lugubrious tunnel-keeper who misdirected him, let Molly cut herself and lacked a lavatory. Tony Banks would approve.</p>

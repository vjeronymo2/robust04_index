Nigeria has, however, opted to establish her presence  in a portion of the disputed region, which is the bone of  contention between two Nigerian communities. The director of  information at the defense headquarters, Brigadier General Fred  Chijuka, clarified the Federal Government's position today on a  Radio Nigeria program, "Behind the Headlines." Brig. Gen.  Chijuka explained that the government was keeping a close watch  on developments in the area, while making all contingency  arrangements.</p>

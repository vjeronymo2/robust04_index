			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Nikolay Kalintsev] </F>   [Text] Moscow, April 21 (TASS) -- Russian Prime Minister  Viktor Chernomyrdin met with visiting German Minister of  Economics Guenter Rexrodt on Thursday to discuss prospects for  economic cooperation between Russia and Germany.    In an interview with ITAR-TASS, Rexrodt said they discussed  joint projects, all in all 15, ways to boost bilateral trade and  increase german investments in Russia. Special attention was  paid to the creation of a favourable climate for German  investors. However, this will require the Russian parliament to  adopt certain laws, he added.    The German minister believes that economic issues will  feature prominently during Russian President Boris Yeltsin's  upcoming visit to Germany scheduled for May. Some of the  projects that were discussed today will be considered by Yeltsin  and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Bonn. It is unclear as yet  whether or not cooperation agreements will be signed during his  visit. It is much more important that the talks in Germany  should give a new impetus to bilateral economic relations.    Germany welcomes Russia's willingness to conclude an  agreement on partnership and cooperation with the European  Union. However, this will take some time as it is necessary to  take into account the interests of eu countries and meet some  conditions, including adopt certain laws in Russia, the minister  said.</p>

			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / International Company News: Kawasaki Heavy bids for shipyard KAWASAKI Heavy Industries of Japan is bidding for Philippine Shipyard and Engineering under a programme aimed at auctioning 87 per cent of state shareholdings in the 52-hectare shipyard, Reuter reports from Tokyo. Kawasaki, in conjunction with a Philippines group, will bid for the shipyard at a tender to be held early next month. The Japanese company owned 40 per cent - with a Philippine state investment group holding the rest - when the shipyard began life in 1976. It reduced its stake to 4 per cent in 1988 after the shipyard fell into financial difficulty.</p>

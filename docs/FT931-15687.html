			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Savimbi 'still at HQ' ANGOLAN rebel leader Jonas Savimbi, in a defiant radio broadcast, told followers yesterday he was still at his post in his stronghold, Huambo, and his Unita forces were still battling government troops, Reuter reports from Johannesburg. 'It is a lie that my house is in MPLA (government) hands,' Mr Savimbi declared over his group's radio, The Voice of the Resistance of the Black Cockerel. The battle for Huambo, Angola's second most important city, has been raging for three days, with little independent information reaching the outside and both sides issuing wildly conflicting claims. Diplomats in the capital, Luanda, believed yesterday that the government had the upper hand and most Unita troops had retreated to the outskirts of the central highlands city. An army communique on Saturday said government troops had captured Mr Savimbi's headquarters near Huambo airport.</p>

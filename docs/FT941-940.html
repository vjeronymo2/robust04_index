			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Fears mount over laws on late payment Small-business lobby groups pressing for companies to have a statutory right to interest on commercial debts that are paid late said yesterday that they believed the government would not back legislation. They suspect that Lord Strathclyde, the small business minister, favours non-statutory methods to persuade companies to publicise their payment record in order to 'shame' the late payers into improving their payment records. The views of the lobby groups emerged amid confusion about the government's intentions, during a consultation period which is due to end this week. Newspaper reports suggested that tough laws could be on the way but both the Treasury and the Department of Trade and Industry were adamant yesterday that such speculation was premature and no decisions had been taken. According to Lord Strathclyde the government was taking the idea of legislating on late payment 'fairly seriously' while recognising that there was 'no point in doing it unless it will make a difference'. He said the Federation of Small Businesses had told him it did not regard legislation as the top priority. Lord Strathclyde rejected the notion of imposing a standard period for payment of debt. He said: 'People should be free to decide what the terms of credit should be.' But he said ministers would decide on whether to legislate on making people comply with contracts. Companies and business groups have until Thursday to make submissions on the government's consultative document, which was issued after Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, put the issue on the agenda in his November Budget. The Department of Trade and Industry is expected to take a couple of months to digest more than 200 submissions before deciding what, if anything, it will do to address a problem that many companies say is increasingly serious. Some small-business lobby groups said the government showed no sign of shedding a conviction that legislation was not the way to alleviate the problem. The issue has split the small-business community along some unexpected lines. Ranked against the legislation is the Confederation of British Industry, which says its small business members have recently become more opposed to the legislation as it might do more harm than good. The 58,000-strong Federation of Small Businesses - formerly the National Federation of Self-Employed - is a cautious supporter of legislation, but only if the government first takes other steps. Such measures would include forcing the top 10,000 companies in the UK to publish their payment records in their annual reports and moves to ensure that any future legal judgments against late payers would be directly enforceable by the courts. Leading the campaign in favour of legislation is the 21,000-strong Forum of Private Business, which has been joined by most of the high street banks and the Institute of Directors. Labour and the Liberal Democrats support legislation. Last week more than 200 MPs, including 80 Conservative backbenchers, signed an early day motion calling for a statutory right to interest on overdue debts. Editorial comment, Page 13</p>

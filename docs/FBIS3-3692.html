In a friendly atmosphere Li and Ballen exchanged views on  issues of common concern.    Li said that the talks between the presidents of the two  countries yesterday afternoon were fruitful, with extensive  common understanding reached and some important agreements  signed.    He added that he believed that the current visit by  President  Ballen, who is also accompanied by some entrepreneurs, will  surely help promote bilateral relations.    Li continued that, as a developing country, the economic aid  that China can offer to the other developing countries is quite  limited, adding the aid is a kind of manifestation of friendship.    But Li said that China is willing to further cooperative  relations in economy, trade and other fields with Ecuador.    Ballen agreed that his talks with Chinese President Jiang  Zemin were fruitful, saying that the Ecuadorian Government  respects China's achievements in economic construction.    He also said he hoped that the economic and trade  cooperation  between the two countries would be further enhanced.    The Ecuadorian president noted that there exist unreasonable  economic structure and unfair commodity prices in the world,  which make the economies of many developing countries, including  Ecuador, suffer big losses and many difficulties.    Li agreed with Ballen, adding that there are still in the  current world hegemonism and power politics, as well as an  unreasonable political and economic order.    He said that for the developing countries the most  outstanding problems are the heavy debt burdens and unfair  exchange rates. Such a situation should be changed and China  will make efforts to this end, together with Ecuador and other  developing countries, Li added.    Ballen invited Li to visit Ecuador and Li expressed his  thanks for the invitation.    Those present at the meeting were Zhu Lin, wife of Li Peng,  Josefina Villalobos de Duran Ballen, wife of President Ballen,  and Vice Minister of Agriculture Wu Yixia, who is also chairman  of the Chinese Government Reception Committee.</p>

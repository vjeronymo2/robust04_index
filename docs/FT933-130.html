			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Ipeco Ipeco Holdings, a maker of specialist products for the aviation and defence industries, suffered a fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.82m to Pounds 1.57m in the half year to June 26. Turnover improved from Pounds 10.1m to Pounds 10.6m. Mr Christopher Johnson, chairman, said the results reflected the poor trading conditions in the civil aerospace industry. The effect had been ameliorated, however, by tight management controls and a more friendly exchange rate environment. The interim dividend is held at 1.3p, payable from earnings per share of 3.8p (4.42p).</p>

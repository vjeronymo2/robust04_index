			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 16 (XINHUA) -- Enterprises in Hong  Kong funded by the Chinese mainland have expanded their business  in recent years, steadily enlarging the "Chinese factor" in Hong  Kong's economic development and contributing to ensuring smooth  transition and economic prosperity in Hong Kong.    Huang Diyan, vice-chairman of the Bank of China and a deputy  to the National People's Congress (NPC), made the remarks at the  current NPC session.    Since 1985 when Hong Kong entered a transition period,  mainland- funded enterprises have expanded their business and  many new ones have mushroomed, thanks to the mainland's reform  and open policies, he said.    For instance, he said, such long-established enterprises in  Hong Kong [H.K.] as China Resources (Holdings) Co., Ltd., China  Merchants (Holdings) Ltd., China Travel Service (Holdings) Hong  Kong Ltd., the Bank of China Group and China Insurance Hong Kong  (Holdings) Co., Ltd. all have had impressive development, with  their assets reaching more than one billion, ten billion and  even 100 billion H.K. dollars each.    The Bank of China group has become the second largest  banking  group in Hong Kong, with savings deposits of 400 billion H.K.  dollars and total assets of 700 billion H.K. dollars.    Many mainland enterprises such as China International Trust  and Investment Corporation, Everbright Industrial Company and  China Overseas Building Development Co. have opened and  developed their business in Hong Kong in recent years.    Huang said mainland enterprises in Hong Kong are playing an  increasingly important role in Hong Kong's economic activities.  Many means of livelihood, especially those supplied by the  mainland, are shipped and marketed by mainland enterprises  including China Resources (Holdings) Co., Ltd.    Mainland enterprises also manage marine and river transport,  especially shipping between Hong Kong and mainland ports.    Huang said his Bank of China Group in Hong Kong extends most  of its loans to Hong Kong's industrial and commercial sectors,  infrastructure and other social sectors. Last year the bank  extended loans worth 16 billion H.K. dollars to Hong Kong's  local industry and mortgage loans worth nearly 100 billion H.K.  dollars for Hong Kong residents to buy housing units.    The Bank of China Group has helped local authorities keep  Hong Kong's financial market stable and ensure a healthy  operation of Hong Kong's banking and securities sectors, Huang  said.    In the future, he said, mainland-funded enterprises in Hong  Kong should continue to develop in order to build up an economic  foundation for Hong Kong's smooth transition.    Mainland-funded enterprises should not only play a bigger  role in economic activities in Hong Kong but also try to have  their own spokesmen in the political field -- their own  representatives in the Hong Kong Legislative Council's  functional constituencies, Huang said.</p>

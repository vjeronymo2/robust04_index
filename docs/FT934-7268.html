			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Evans Halshaw pays up to Pounds 9m for TK Motor Evans Halshaw, the Solihull-based motor distribution group, is buying TK Motor Group, a privately-owned chain of seven dealerships, for Pounds 6.5m, rising to Pounds 9m if TK profits double in its current financial year, writes Paul Cheeseright. TK dealerships in Grantham, Newcastle under Lyme, Telford, Wednesbury and Wrexham, hold Peugeot, Fiat, Renault and Citroen franchises. Evans Halshaw has not hitherto had Fiat or Citroen franchises. Both the initial and conditional payments will be made in shares or, in the case of the conditional payment, loan notes. The initial payment involves the issue of 1.62m shares, based on a price of 401.5p. TK is owned by Mr Richard Teatum and Mr Mike Keen.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Another State Department Aggression"] </F>   [Text] The U.S. State Department is responsible--regardless  of its good or bad intentions--for another attack against Peru.  This time through the disclosure in Washington of a report on  Peruvian justice prepared by a commission of international  jurists sponsored by the U.S. State Department. This reported  was widely covered by the international media.    An AFP report, for example, disseminated throughout the  world  states that according to that commission, "the reorganization of  the Peruvian judicial branch carried out by President Alberto  Fujimori since his self-inflicted coup has seriously eroded, if  not eliminated, the independence of this branch in Peru." The  report urges Peru "to eliminate anonymous judges, define with  precision what the crime of betrayal of the fatherland entails,  and review the decree law against terrorism."    The damage this information causes Peru is obvious,  especially taking into account that it does not reflect reality.  It is no secret that the Peruvian judicial branch currently is  undergoing a deep-rooted reform, ranging from the  appointment--not by the executive branch but by the Disciplinary  Board for Magistrates, which enjoys consensus--of worthy and  capable judges to an efficient and modern administration of the  institution and the implementation of new modern procedural  codes.    For the first time in the republican history of Peru, our  Supreme Court members are selected after passing difficult tests  and not due to political influences. These judges enjoy full  independence because they owe nobody in the executive branch or  Congress, except their own ability, for their posts. But neither  the commission of jurists nor the State Department ever mentions  this fact. To ignore this, especially under the circumstances  Peru has experienced, represents a lie.    The antiterrorist laws--harsh and of a summary nature in the  beginning--have made it possible to severely punish terrorists  who in the past almost always were freed, and at the same time  give them a chance to repent. This formula has been an effective  legal and psychological tool in the struggle against terrorism,  which by far is the main threat not only to human rights, but  also to the survival of the Peruvian nation. Moreover, these  laws have become more flexible through the implementation of  other measures approved last year before these pure and  immaculate jurists finished their report. These laws will be  made more flexible in a gradual and prudent manner. The Peruvian  citizenry is not willing to run any risks....    Therefore, what is the U.S. State Department's purpose in  giving the world a distorted image of Peru? Why isn't Peru  judged the same way as countries such as the PRC and Mexico,  whose judicial and electoral institutions are indeed pinpointed  by the executive branch?    The parameters used for Peru are so different and so  shockingly incapable of taking into account--for many obvious  reasons--the same considerations given other countries, that one  wonders whether what really bothers the U.S. State Department is  the fact that the Peruvian president is of Japanese descent and  may thus represent, in the nightmares of U.S. officials, the  spearhead of Japanese economic power pointing toward Brazil,  where the largest Japanese colony in America resides and from  where the soybean that the all of Asia consumes comes.    If this were the case, which we believe is not, the State  Department should say it aloud. It is no secret that during  World War II niseis were persecuted in Peru with the support of  the local authorities that ruled at that time and under the  sponsorship of the also Democratic Washington administration at  that time. We wonder whether the commercial war that is about to  unleashed between these two powers also will be fought over our  heads?    Peru now is proud to have, in the midst of its poverty and  most serious domestic decay, given intelligent and successful  answers to win the internal war that already has resulted in so  many deaths.    Therefore, the fact that the State Department sponsors the  international dissemination of a deceitful, superficial, and  slanderous report drafted by four jurists, as the justice  minister has rightly stated, after a stay of only three days in  our country represents a lack of respect for our country.</p>

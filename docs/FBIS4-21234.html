Specifically, she wants  to spend 20 million kroner to copy a treatment model used in  Italy.    The model is called the ``Human Project'' and it comes from  the solidarity center in Rome. The project is based on the idea  that both the addict and his family will participate in the  therapy. To a great extent, it is the family's responsibility to  see that ``its'' black sheep gets back on his feet again. The  drug addict enters a contractual agreement. If he breaks the  contract, he must face the consequences.    ``To a far greater extent than now, drug addicts in Denmark  will be responsible for their own survival. At the same time,  their private network will take on more of the burden. The work  that both the addict and his family perform at the treatment  center, such as cleaning, cooking, and repair work, will be  necessary to make the whole system work,'' Andersen said.    ``Danes have gotten used to the idea that the authorities  will pull the addict through. Consequently, the Italian model  cannot immediately replace traditional treatment. It will take  several generations before we no longer simply step over those  who are lying around on Stroget. But trial projects could be a  starting point,'' the minister said.</p>

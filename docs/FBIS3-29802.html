This war game involved fighter planes based in Okinawa,  Japan, and more than 450 fighter planes of different types  belonging to the U.S. Air Force present in South Korea and the  puppet Air Force. Flying above Yongwol, Chongju and Yesan of  South Korea, they staged exercises of a surprise bombing on  targets, a support to ground attack, a long-distance movement,  entry into war and an aerial attack.    In separate action, the South Korean puppets on the 17th and  18th committed a war gamble against the North in the areas of  Chorwon, Hwachon and Inje, South Korean Kangwon Province, and  Yonchon in Kyonggi Province.</p>

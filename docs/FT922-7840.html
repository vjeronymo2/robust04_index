			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Burton halved as multiples suffer BURTON GROUP, which owns Debenhams and a string of fashion chains, saw interim pre-tax profits halved as it sought to defend market share by sacrificing margin and cutting prices. In the 26 weeks to February 29, pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 44.1m to Pounds 21.8m on sales 2 per cent higher at Pounds 934.6m. But although gross margins slipped by 0.8 per cent, Mr John Hoerner, chief executive of three months' standing, said the group had succeeded in restoring its market share to 12 per cent after shedding 1 percentage point in the previous half. He added that sales from continuing businesses in the first 10 weeks of the second half were ahead 7 per cent but attributed the increase to restocking and operational improvements rather than a general recovery in the clothing sector. 'I think there has been a pick-up in conversation about consumer demand and a definite improvement in mood but it would be seriously misleading if I said I had any indication that it had yet happened,' he said. There was a marked difference in trading fortunes between the two arms of the group. Debenhams, where Mr Hoerner was previously chief executive, lifted trading profits by 4 per cent to Pounds 29.5m on sales 11 per cent higher at Pounds 426.8m. But the fashion multiples saw a drastic fall in profits from Pounds 32.2m to Pounds 3.1m on sales just 1 per cent lower at Pounds 507.8m. Top Shop, Dorothy Perkins, and Evans were said to have recorded 'better performances' while Top Man and Principles for Men were disappointing. The group received Pounds 124m from asset sales, including Harvey Nichols and the Dartford shopping centre. Net debt stood at Pounds 237m compared with Pounds 476m a year ago, representing a fall in gearing from 63 per cent to 33 per cent. Earnings per share slid from 4.8p to 2p. An interim dividend of 1p (1.7p) is declared. The group announced a streamlining of management functions which will result in the departures of Mr Richard Pym as chief executive of the services division and Mr Brian Moody as managing director of Burton menswear. Mr Pym's pay-off was not disclosed but was described as 'less than extraordinary', unlike those given to other departing board directors in recent months. COMMENT Burton should represent an object lesson in the perils of investing in personalities. Ironically, however, that may now represent just about the best reason for returning to the UK's second biggest clothing retailer. In the short term he has been in charge, Mr Hoerner has impressed the City with his candour and common sense and although there are as yet few substantial signs of trading improvement there is a tangible swing in sentiment as evidenced by the 7 1/2 p rise in the share price to 49 1/2 p yesterday. Burton is now a finely-balanced risk-reward scenario but the market may be over-eager about the pace and strength of recovery. Although the group is at last moving in the right direction, it would be unwise to presume that it will easily be able to rebuild margins, given the restocking and restaffing that is still needed and the escalation of pressure that the likes of Marks and Spencer can still bring to bear. And although the group may just be in the black at the year end the dividend is still likely to be cut.</p>

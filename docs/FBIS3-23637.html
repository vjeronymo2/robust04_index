			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed news item: "Giving Up on the `Varyah'?"] </F>   [Text] The initial plans to refine the Varyah [Varyag]  aircraft carrier are impossible, but it could still be made into  a floating airfield, feels the new director of the Black Sea  Shipyard Ihor Ovdiyenko. Ukraine itself cannot complete the  building of this ship, says the head of the largest shipyard in  Ukraine. The Varyah meanwhile occupies a quay, creating problems  with its utilization and causing expenses for servicing it in a  mothballed state. The plant cannot independently resolve the  issue of cutting up or selling the ship. A great deal of money  has moreover been invested in the Varyah, and courage is needed  to dare to give up on it now.</p>

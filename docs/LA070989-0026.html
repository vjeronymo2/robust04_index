			<p><P> July 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TAKING BACK THE PARKS  </P> <P> The cover reminded me of my favorite graffiti in Los Angeles County. When one  visits the Huntington Botanical Gardens in San Marino, one is naturally drawn  to the beautifully manicured theme gardens. Each has its own charm, but the  Japanese garden is the most distinctive. Close inspection of the tall bamboo  brings shock, then amusement. Visitors have left their marks by carving  hundreds of ideograms on the trees. With no knowledge of the language, one  leaves with a mixed impression. Strangers have defaced what others have  created. But perhaps they have felt so welcome that they have treated this  garden as they would their own. In any case, they have added an Eastern version  that blends nicely with the diversity of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> RICHARD K. MOORE  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

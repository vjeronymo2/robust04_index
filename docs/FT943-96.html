			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / International Company News: Banesto 'flexible' on Totta holding Mr Alfredo Saenz, chairman of Spain's Banesto, said yesterday that he was prepared to be flexible about his bank's disputed shareholding in Portugal's profitable Banco Totta &amp; Acores group, but that Banesto insisted on maintaining management control of Totta. Banesto owns 24.9 per cent of Totta and it has an indirect stake of 25 per cent, placed with Portuguese portfolio companies, which is held in loans with purchase options. The Portuguese government has contested the Spanish bank's indirect holding and the disputed equity is now the object of a parliamentary investigation in Lisbon. 'We are legally in the clear for what we hold directly, there is nothing illegal about the indirect equity and our position in Totta is backed by European Union legislation,' Mr Saenz said. He added that there was no question of Banesto relinquishing management control of the Portuguese bank. 'We have control, we want to have it and we are not going to lose the business.' But Banesto's chairman conceded that the issue had become intensely politicised and that it was 'uncomfortable' to be in confrontation with the Portuguese authorities. 'We are therefore disposed to be flexible,' he said. Under the guidelines of Totta's privatisation in 1989, no foreign institution may own more than 25 per cent of the bank. The Portuguese government holds 14.5 per cent.</p>

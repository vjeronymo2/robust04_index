			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Survey of International Telecommunications (15): Japan leads the way - The fax phenomenon WITH THE worldwide installed base of facsimile machines fast approaching 30m units and the volume of facsimile transmissions doubling every three years, the market might appear to have reached saturation point. Far from it. The number of new technologies, services and products being announced almost daily only gives a hint of what the future holds for fax as the simplest of all technologies for transmitting exact copies of original documents. According to the market research organisation, BIS Strategic Decisions, market volume for fax machines in western Europe increased by 9 per cent in 1991, giving a year-end total of 1.68m units sold, with Germany accounting for 27 per cent, followed by Italy with 17 per cent, France 15 per cent and the UK 12 per cent. In contrast, market value increased just 1 per cent in 1991, reaching USDollars 2.63m. The general view is that plain paper fax (PPF) will be the strongest sector and will represent 50 per cent of sales by 1995. Not surprising, then, that the competition is getting stiffer, with those launching PPFs this year including Canon, Infotec, Hitachi, Konica, Lanier, Minolta, Mita, Mitsubishi, Oki, Olivetti, Panasonic, Pitney Bowes, Rank Xerox, Ricoh, Sanyo, Toshiba and Triumph Adler. BIS believes that plain paper for the small business/home office sector will also develop, with low-cost ink jet technology predominating. The residential thermal fax market will also develop over the next four years, with price levels (under USDollars 400) and innovative applications (home shopping, reservation and order confirmation services) boosting consumer spending. In the European market, Frost &amp; Sullivan researchers estimate that the Dollars 3.54bn worth of sales in 1991 will rise dramatically to Dollars 7.64bn by 1996, with new demand created by changing work practices. An example is multifunction machines for home-based users, with sales of units combining telephone, answering, fax and PC-interface facilities rising from Dollars 78m in 1991 to Dollars 517m by 1996. It is a growth rate that should be music to the ears of suppliers such as Canon, Amstrad and Panasonic as well as Brother and Fujitsu who offer plain paper fax output via laser printer links. On the question of fax machine manufacture, Frost &amp; Sullivan suggests that the Japanese, with upwards of 90 per cent share of production to date, will remain in control, either directly from Japan or manufactured within Europe or the US. This is underlined by the fact that, following the decision by Alcatel of France to stop fax machine manufacture, only Sagem, Ricoh and Fuji Xerox now have European production facilities. However, having recognised the opportunities in the small and home-based office market, Samsung of Korea has announced a two-year Pounds 4.5m investment programme in a fax production plant at Teesside, UK, which will operate as their European manufacturing and distribution hub. At the higher end of the market, the emerging generation of enhanced fax machines and services should prove particularly interesting, with store-and-forward fax, payphone fax, networked fax and integrated voice/fax/electronic mail showing strong growth. Though the industry is beleaguered by lack of internationally recognised computer-fax message communications standards, the US market as a key indicator of future potential. There, the standalone PC and network facsimile board market is expected to grow from Dollars 62.9m in 1991 to USDollars 184.7m by 1996, with fax network services growing ten-fold from Dollars 15.3m in 1991 to Dollars 156.8m by 1996. Developments such as the ability to transmit fax messages from within applications will support the growth of computer-fax. In this respect, the API (application programming interface) specification agreed by the members of the US FaxBios Association may help. The first to promote the initiative in a deliverable product is WordPerfect with the launch of Works 1.0, a fully integrated software package that allows users to fax documents anywhere in the world without leaving the program. But Tony Sellars of fax/data modem suppliers, Andest, believes that the advent of the Windows operating system will be the main catalyst to the wider-spread acceptance of computer-fax. 'With Windows, you can fax from within any application as easily as you can print; in background and from within any application,' he notes. Companies targeting the computer networked fax market include Communicate, Comwave, Data &amp; Control Equipment and 4Sight. Rank Xerox is one of the few to opt for an integrated fax machine/software approach (LanFax/Express 7033) which can make use of DTMF dialling for routing inbound faxes direct to workstations. Other developments that make fax even more relevant in the PC market include FaxGrabber for Windows from Calera Recognition Systems, the first utility to enable fax images to be received directly into more than 50 applications, including word processing, desktop publishing and spreadsheets, with all or part of the received image capable of being converted into an editable text file. The need to use Diskfax from Alpha Systems, or to print before faxing or to convert images to editable files after faxing disappears. Computer files can be transmitted disk-to-disk, at the touch of a button, over the PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network), Inmarsat satellite links, Cellnet or Vodafone mobile networks. Typically used for financial consolidation where data integrity and security are paramount, but ideal for transmitting exact copies of information stored on floppy disks, including statistics, CAD/CAM files, graphics, spreadsheets and reports, the system operates just like conventional fax, except that you insert a disk, rather than a sheet of paper. Enhanced fax services are only in their infancy, but with developments such as the incorporation of optical character recognition for remote access to fax mailboxes and computer databases (as already offered by Konica and Xerox), voice annotation and speech-to-text conversion, an entire new realm of applications and services not yet envisaged will be possible. Both Ascom Telecommunications and UK-based TISL say that the uptake of integrated voice and fax mail systems for international communications is already growing rapidly in Europe. As a result of demand, new features and facilities include automatic fax message redistribution via DTMF dialling; multi-language greeting options for callers wanting to leave a fax/voice message; and DDI (direct dial-in) numbers enabling messages to go either direct to a fax machine or routed to the user's fax/voice mailbox. While sceptics of Group 4 fax say that faster 64K modems will enable Group 3 machines to offer ultra high speeds at lower cost, it is some years away yet. Meanwhile, G4 over ISDN is a solution. As an example of the potential cost-savings, Canon estimates that, by using its new L3300i fax rather than a Group 3 machine to transmit 100 pages per day to the US, users would save Pounds 4,735 a year. The advent of ISDN also opens the market to colour fax technology to design companies, printshops, advertising agencies, couriers, fax bureaux and others able to justify the Pounds 20,000 unit cost. Both Canon and Ricoh have colour fax machines in the wings, with Sharp the first to deliver a machine offering no less than 262,000 different nuances of colour in 400dpi resolution. The market for mobile communications devices that integrate fax with cellular phone, modem and pen-based computer technologies has led EO Inc. to set up a partnership with AT&amp;T, Matsushita and Marubeni that will design, build and market a new generation of personal communicators. The prize is a share of a market destined to be worth Dollars 20bn by the year 2000</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 17 (AFP)--Chinese police briefly  held two leading Shanghai dissidents for questioning less than  one week after releasing them from detention, one of the  activisits said Sunday. Yang Zhou, spokesman of the Chinese  Human Rights Association, said by telephone that he was taken  from his home at 3:30 p.m. (0730 GMT) Saturday and released at  about 10:30 p.m., adding that fellow activist Bao Ge had also  been pulled in. The 50-year-old veteran dissident described his  detention as a "warning," saying police had told him to stop his  campaigning. Bao's father said his 31-year-old son was taken  away by two policemen at 5:15 p.m. (0915 GMT) Saturday as he  left his home, adding that he was released at about the same  time as Yang.    Yang and Bao were last detained on April 9 in a sweep on  dissidents as French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur arrived in  Shanghai. They were released the following day but kept  incommunicado in their flats for several hours until the French  delegation left the city.    Bao, an ardent campaigner for Japan to pay reparations for  atrocities committed in the 1937-1945 Sino-Japanese war, has  said he wants to form a new human rights organisation dedicated  to solving concrete social issues. "We absolutely must be closer  to the people," he said recently.    Activists have begun reemerging from the shadows in recent  months, forming groups again for the first time since Beijing's  Tiananmen Square massacre on June 4, 1989, and publicly  demanding more democracy in China as discontent grows over  soaring inflation, corruption and other social ills. The  continuing detentions are part of tightened security as the  government seeks to stamp out such activities in the run-up to  the sensitive fifth anniversary on June 4th of the army's  violent suppression of Beijing's democracy movement.</p>

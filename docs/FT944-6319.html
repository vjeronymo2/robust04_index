			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Observer: Hoarse laughter They must be feeling pretty flat in Newmarket after seeing the latest official perk granted to South Africa's small but influential racing industry. Henceforth, the purchase of a racehorse is to be completely tax deductible. The capital cost can be written off against tax at a flat 25 per cent per year depreciation over four years. The new legislation even allows owners unhappy with their horses' performance to stay happy. When a racehorse is retired from active competition, its entire purchase price immediately becomes claimable against tax. A case of South Africa's Finance Department attempting to re-open the stable door after the winnings have bolted?</p>

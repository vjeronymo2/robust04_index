			<p><P> October 30, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> REGIONAL ROUNDUP: SANTA CLARITA SHAREHOLDERS OK SECURITY PACIFIC DEAL  </P> <P> Shareholders of Santa Clarita National Bank voted unanimously on Oct. 26 to  approve a merger agreement with Security Pacific Corp. of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> But the vote doesn't guarantee that the merger will go through.  </P> <P> The agreement would allow Santa Clarita National, which has 11 branches, to  back out of the deal if Security Pacific's stock is below an average of $26 for  the five days prior to closing of the deal, now set for Nov. 15. Security  Pacific's stock has recently traded for less than $20, closing Monday at $17.75  per share.  </P> <P> Security Pacific first announced in March that it had agreed to acquire Santa  Clarita National for $52.5 million in stock. But Security Pacific's stock has  fallen precipitously since then, like that of many banks nationwide.  </P> <P> With the decline in its stock price, Security Pacific has now agreed to pay a  maximum of about 1.75 million shares to acquire Santa Clarita National.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Uljin, June 1 (YONHAP) -- Yielding to local  villagers' protests, the government has retracted a plan to  build a large radioactive nuclear waste disposal yard here in  Uljin along the east coast.    Uljin County Commissioner Kim Tong-hui met reporters  Wednesday afternoon to make public Science and Technology  Minister Kim Si-chung's message containing the retraction.    The message read in part, "This is to inform you that  although some residents of the Uljin area tried to induce a  radioactive waste management facility, the government has  decided not to set up such a facility in the Uljin area in  consideration of various conditions."    Meanwhile, large crowds of Uljin people mounted various  protest actions for the fifth straight day Wednesday against the  planned creation of a nuclear waste yard.    About 1,500 high school students staged a sit-in along a  major road near Uljin-up beginning around 2 PM while about 200  shop owners in the Uljin town closed their shops for the day as  a sign of protest.    Around 12 noon, some 1,000 villagers of Puk-myon poured into  the street and blocked traffic.    Of the 12,000 primary and secondary school students in the  Uljin area, about 10,000 boycotted classes wedensday in a  protest move.</p>

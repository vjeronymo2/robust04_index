			<p><P> March 31, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PALMDALE AIRPORT  </P> <P> For years Los Angeles city officials have talked about using the huge Palmdale  Airport as an extension of Los Angeles International Airport. Since the city is  predicting soaring LAX traffic (March 12), now is the time to put that facility  to use. There could be an overhead monorail train running from LAX to Palmdale  Airport to transport passengers, thus alleviating the traffic congestion and  the presumed huge number of passengers expected by the year 2000. Such action  would also increase employment and business in both areas.  </P> <P> JOHNNIE F. KIRVIN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

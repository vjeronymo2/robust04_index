			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] General Cedras must resign as head of the  military in order to facilitate a quick solution to the crisis,  says Reynold Georges [leader of ALAH, Alliance for the  Liberation and Progress of Haiti], who criticizess Raoul Cedras'  attitude, which he calls that of a clan chief. In statements to  Signal FM, Georges has expressed total support for the French  ship carrying humanitarian aid to Haiti. The situation cannot  remain entangled because of a single man, he asserts. Reynold  Georges says Mr. Cedras must leave.    [Begin Georges recording, in Creole] We in ALAH agree with  the aid. The reason we agree with the aid is that we cannot let  the Haitian people die. We have heard that other political  organizations (?oppose it.) As far we are concerned, we say no.  The ship must arrive because we cannot let the people's children  die. The situation is serious, there is no medicine, and if we  let the people's children die, this means we are not responsible  persons. There is no glory in death.    When one is a political leader, one must manage one's  country  for the benefit of its people. If you let the people die, you  have failed. This is the reason we say that the aid must come:  Those who staged the coup d'etat have not managed it for the  benefit of the Haitian people. They have managed for the benefit  of their friends and relatives, which we protest. This is the  reason we are urging the Armed Forces once again -- in  compliance with Article 265 of the Constitution -- to withdraw  from politics: They have proved the international community  right in saying there is a military junta in Haiti.    We in ALAH have eventually come to agree with the  international community that it is indeed the Army that is  leading the country. People must be courageous enough to say  that. If one does not speak the truth, one will not be freed.  [passage omitted] [end recording]</p>

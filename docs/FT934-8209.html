			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Syria accused over flare-up: Pro-Israeli militiamen captured in Lebanon ISRAEL yesterday accused Syria of fomenting a worsening of hostilities in southern Lebanon, during which 12 members of a pro-Israeli militia were captured by Hizbollah gunmen. Yesterday's violence was the worst since Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation signed their peace accords in Washington two months ago. Israeli ministers claimed Syria had ordered the Hizbollah attacks, out of frustration at Israel's refusal to meet Damascus' peace demands by withdrawing from the Golan Heights. Lebanon's Defence Minister Mohsen Dalloul claimed Israel was heightening tension to undermine 'positive moves towards a just peace'. During the fighting, between Hizbollah, and Israeli troops and their South Lebanon Army militia allies, two Israeli soldiers were wounded by rockets landing metres from the Israeli border. Hizbollah launched grenades against six villages inside Israel's self-proclaimed south Lebanon 'security zone'.</p>

			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Sunday Times admits error on travel promotion The Sunday Times has withdrawn a letter to tour operators that appeared to suggest that they could buy editorial space in the paper. The letter was sent to operators earlier this month by The Travel Bureau, a Lancashire-based travel agent, under the Sunday Times letterhead. The Travel Bureau operates the Sunday Times Travel Card scheme - which allows members 10 per cent discounts on holidays - for the Sunday Times. The letter promised tour operators 'editorial in Style &amp; Travel' - a section of the paper - if they paid a marketing charge of Pounds 20,000, or Pounds 25,000 for colour. Last night Mr Andrew Neil, the Sunday Times editor, said the letter had been sent by Mr John Wall, a director of The Travel Bureau, without checking with him or with Mr Paul Woolfenden, the Sunday Times director of promotions. Mr Neil said: 'You cannot buy editorial in The Sunday Times. You never have and you never will be able to while I am editor.' Mr Woolfenden confirmed last night that the letter had not been cleared with him. He said it was a mistake and a new letter was being sent out. Mr Woolfenden said the writer of the letter had been reprimanded. He conceded that the wording could have been misconstrued. He said the 'editorial' referred to was in fact paid advertising associated with the Travel Card promotion. Mr Wall confirmed last night that the mistake had been his and was a result of his lack of experience of newspaper terminology. The Travel Bureau is a member of the Association of British Travel Agents and will only offer holidays from Abta operators. The Sunday Times letter attracted protests from the Association of Independent Tour Operators, which represents 140 small companies. In a letter to Mr Neil last week the association said: 'It seems to us that if the proposed promotional plan was made public, it would cause considerable embarrassment to the Sunday Times since it is quite clear that substantial financial contributions are linked directly with editorial coverage.' The association added that the promotion would damage the business of its members, many of which advertise in the Sunday Times. It said many could not afford fees of Pounds 20,000 or Pounds 25,000 to participate in the promotion. Their letter to Mr Neil said: 'Unless you can offer our members some action to redress the balance and recompense them for the losses your newspaper will doubtless cause them, we will have no option but to urge our members to withdraw their advertising from the Sunday Times forthwith.' Mr Neil said he would look into the complaint that The Sunday Times was 'actively working against its advertisers', but said he had no intention of allowing his promotions policy to be dictated by advertisers. He said: 'If it really is unfair competition, I will consider the issue. 'If it is a trade association bleating because they face extra competition, then to hell with it.'</p>

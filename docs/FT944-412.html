			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / British Gas attacked over cut in leak checks British Gas found itself caught in another storm yesterday as a leaked memo showed sharp cuts in its budget for checking gas leaks. The memo - sent out on December 5 by the company's newly created gas transportation arm Transco - said 'revised procedures' would permit a cut from Pounds 9m to Pounds 1m a year now that safety had improved and pipeline modernisation was nearing completion. Mr Nigel Griffiths, shadow consumer minister, who published the memo, said: 'British Gas cannot give an assurance that safety standards will not be reduced following a budget cut of this magnitude. 'This cut was planned and implemented in secret. Neither key safety employees nor the unions were consulted. Even British Gas's own workforce has not been told how levels of safety will be maintained on a ninth of the former budget.' He demanded that Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister, hold an inquiry into the justification for the move. The cut affects the continuous surveying British Gas carries out on its thousands of miles of gas pipelines nationally. Much of the system has recently had its cast iron pipes replaced with plastic. British Gas denied that safety was being put at risk. It said it would be 'realigning' its survey to concentrate on those parts of the system that were more at risk or susceptible to leaks. This was 'a better use of resources'. The change followed an 18-month review and 'benchmarking' against US practice. The leaked memo comes after two recent gas accidents - one in which an explosion destroyed a house and another where a couple were found dead of asphyxiation on Christmas day. Mr Ian Powe, director of the Gas Consumers Council, said the Health and Safety Executive should intervene to ensure that British Gas 'has not sacrificed yet another principle of public service in its unseemly race to reduce costs and keep competitors at bay'. The cuts had a 'whiff of over-confidence', he said. Mr Jim Waller of Unison, the public services union, said: 'Many employees feel this reduction is . . . an accident waiting to happen.' He could not see how the company could make a cut of this size without harming safety standards. British Gas is still embroiled in controversy over its decision to grant a Pounds 205,000 pay rise to Mr Cedric Brown, its chief executive, while asking showroom employees to take cuts in holidays and pay. The company has said all these actions are designed to make the company more commercial before the gas market is liberalised in 1998.</p>

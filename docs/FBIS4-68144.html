			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Al-Tikriti, Iraq's ambassador to Turkey and a  relative of Saddam Husayn, said that Turkey should cooperate  with Iraq to establish [kurulmasi--no negative as published] a  Kurdish state in the region.    Ambassador al-Tikriti said: "The project of creating a  Kurdish state incorporating Iraq and Turkey is Britain's. The  United States supports this project."    He gave assurances to Turkey, saying: "If the Hammer Force  leaves, we will not allow even a single PKK [Kurdish Workers  Party] militant to take shelter in northern Iraq." [passage  omitted]    Noting that prior to the Gulf crisis no such tension and  disorder existed in the region, al-Tikriti said that at the time  Iraq gave importance to Turkey's security. Asking "where was  the PKK before the Gulf crisis?" al-Tikriti said: "The PKK will  vanish if the Hammer Force leaves and the oil pipeline is  opened. At present, the PKK is being protected and sheltered by  the Kurds in northern Iraq. Ask the Hammer Force to leave. Once  the Hammer Force leaves, our government will restore authority  in the region. Not even one single PKK militant will remain in  northern Iraq. PKK is a terror organization. Besides, Turkey's  security is important to us."    Asked what Iraq's position towards the Kurds will be once  the  Hammer Force leaves, al-Tikriti replied: "We gave official  guarantees to Ozal in the past, and later to Demirel. We told  them that we would not oppress the Kurds."</p>

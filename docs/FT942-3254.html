			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / International Capital Markets: Chicago heads for regulatory clash Chicago's two big futures exchanges and their primary regulator, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, are heading for a showdown over how strictly customer protection rules should be enforced just as the exchanges, and the derivatives industry in general, are attracting a broad range of new customers and large blocks of business. The outcome of the dispute may determine whether the CFTC, which has a reputation as a 'soft-glove' regulator, will be able to function effectively as the main derivatives watchdog in the US, or whether it will be hamstrung by the derivative industry's considerable voice in Congress. The test for the agency comes as its newly-nominated chairman, Ms Mary Schapiro, awaits confirmation on Capitol Hill, and within weeks of the start of Congressional debates on the CFTC's reauthorisation. The CFTC's current mandate expires in October. At issue is the Commission's enforcement of fraud prevention measures mandated in 1989, when the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade were under federal investigation for corrupt trading floor practices. Investigators found weak controls, non-competitive order execution and manipulation of the price and timing of trades. The CFTC responded by ordering the exchanges to audit trades more closely, and Congress, in reauthorising the CFTC in 1992, directed the Commission to enforce tighter audit by October 1993. Congress, through the CFTC, also ordered the exchanges to have in force a modern - and transparent - trade-tracking system by 1995. In spite of the mandates, the exchanges have done little since 1989 to upgrade their existing trade-tracking systems. Instead, they have invested some Dollars 12m in developing a high-tech electronic 'notebook' to be used by traders and brokers to record transactions. The system, dubbed Audit, aims not only to meet the more stringent 1995 trade tracking requirements, but also provide a variety of pit accounting services to brokers. Exchange officials admit that if their goal for the Audit project was simply to create a fool-proof audit trail, it could have been completed quickly and cheaply by 1991. However, by going for a full-service device, they have used technology to successfully delay interim CFTC sanctions. In a review of the CBoT's trade-tracking system last year, for example, the CFTC found it had generated few investigations that resulted in referrals to exchange disciplinary committees, and that the exchange had ignored previous Commission suggestions for upgrading the system. However, the Commission excused the shortcomings, noting the CBoT's commitment to the Audit project, which at that time was due to be implemented in 1995. In a surprise twist last week, however, the exchanges told Congress and the CFTC that they needed another four years to develop Audit. Rather than risk CFTC sanctions for missing the 1995 deadline, the exchanges persuaded an Illinois Congressman to introduce a House Appropriations proceeding that would force the CFTC to extend the trade-tracking deadline to 1999 or risk losing its funding.</p>

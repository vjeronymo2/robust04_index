Janet Gribb reports that two  men have been diagnosed positive for HIV-2, which is so far  associated with people from West Africa and their sexual  contacts:    [Begin Gribb recording] These two new cases bring to three  the number of HIV-2 cases reported in Australia. This strain of  the virus attacks the immune system in the same way, but appears  to progress more slowly towards AIDS. The latest issue of the  AUSTRALIAN HIV SURVEILLANCE REPORT said the two men diagnosed  were in a relationship and the second man appeared to have  contracted HIV-2 from his partner, who may have acquired the  infection as long ago as mid-seventies.    Dr. Nick Crofts of the McFarlane Burnett Center for Medical  Research says the two cases are interesting in that so far no  links with West Africa have been established. He says the  general public need not be concerned about the new cases, as all  Australian blood products are tested for both strains of HIV.  [end recording]    The Victorian AIDS Council says there is no need for any  change in public health policy on AIDS and people should not be  alarmed in the wake of the discovery. AIDS Council President  Michael Bartoff said there are lots of similarities between the  two AIDS strains:    [Begin Bartoff recording] In some ways there are not all  that  many implications. HIV-2 is pretty similar to HIV-1 -- it is  transmitted in exactly the same way, its effects are pretty much  exactly the same -- but in public health terms, in terms of the  sort of prevention of transmission, it is really exactly the  same as the HIV-1, and I think it is something that has also  been well anticipated.

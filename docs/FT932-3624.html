			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / N Korea bows to US over N-treaty NORTH KOREA last night agreed to suspend indefinitely its proposed withdrawal from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, which was to have gone into effect today. The decision was announced in a joint statement with the US at the end of four rounds of talks initiated by the Americans and held in the offices of the US mission to the UN. North Korea's decision to back down left unresolved the question of whether the Pyongyang government would submit to international inspection of nuclear weapons laboratories. But the two countries agreed to continue their talks 'on an equal and unprejudiced basis'. The US has been pressing the North Korean communists not to go ahead with their threat to withdraw from the pact, which aims to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. As an inducement, the Americans indicated earlier they might suspend military exercises with South Korea. The North Koreans are also keen to develop economic relations with the US, and UN diplomats said this was probably a big factor in their decision. Ukraine will temporarily retain nuclear missiles on its territory, possibly for up to two years, Mr Ivan Pliushch, chairman of the Ukrainian parliament and a member of the ruling troika, said yesterday, writes Chrystia Freeland in Kiev.</p>

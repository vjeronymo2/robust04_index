			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Parliament and Politics: Whips weigh their carrots and sticks - How Tory party managers will try to pull MPs into line over Europe THE government's counter-offensive against Tory Euro-sceptics was under way last night, orchestrated by party whips trained in persuasion techniques ranging from the subtle and gentlemanly to the blunt and unforgiving. Mr John Major will take the rare step of addressing the 1922 committee of backbench MPs tomorrow - he usually appears only a few times a year. He met about a dozen wavering MPs in his Commons office yesterday. Other Conservatives have been offered face-to-face meetings with Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, or Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, foreign office minister. Behind the scenes, the 14 government whips have begun to calculate the possible outcomes when the Commons debates Maastricht next week. Until last night, it had been mostly a listening exercise - in contrast with the tactics of the Euro-rebels who have already begun to flood backbenchers' meetings and press colleagues to take sides. Cabinet ministers meet tomorrow morning, before Mr Major addresses backbenchers, to agree next week's motion. They will want a report from Mr Richard Ryder, the chief whip, on the likely extent of opposition. Attempts to head off a defeat are likely to escalate dramatically as the vote approaches. There will be fewer offers of carrots, more use of the stick. Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, is abroad until the weekend but could join government attempts to quell the revolt over the weekend. Whips, by tradition, pride themselves in knowing what the result of a vote will be and, if defeat looks certain, in trying to ensure the government swerves to minimise damage. Last week's climbdown over pit closures, albeit ungraceful and hurried, is a textbook example. Mr Ryder, working from an office off the members' lobby and rarely seen by the public except occasionally in television shots, has a range of weapons to use. For younger MPs there will be grave warnings about future ministerial career prospects. For others there will be appeal to loyalty, reminders of past favours or hints about positions on the Commons select committees - though some Euro-sceptics have already lost theirs. Some Euro-rebels believe the next tactic will be to contact MPs' constituency assoc-iations, alerting local officers of the trouble their member is causing. 'We know it's going to be a tough game,' said one leading Euro-sceptic, as if bracing himself for the battle ahead. One - unlikely - option for Mr Major would be a television address, to appeal over MPs heads to constituents. That might give the impression of panic. A series of television interviews, which can be arranged with only a few hours notice, is an alternative. Whips' techniques vary. Some are civilised, merely politely inquiring into an MP's intentions and offering to help answer points of concern. Mr Ryder is amiable but firm. Mr David Lightbown, the large-framed assistant whip, sometimes intimidates waverers with his gruff voice and burly presence. Each whip oversees a group of MPs, acting as a conduit for the passing on of views and voting intentions. Different MPs require different techniques. 'If you talk to a school teacher about how they treat their children, you will see that they don't use the same method on each of them,' explained one. Heavy-handed techniques can backfire. Mr Walter Sweeney, Tory MP for Vale of Glamorgan, says he was told before the summer recess that he would be 'making life difficult' if he signed a Commons motion tabled by Euro-sceptics. He backed off then but has since told whips in a letter that he will vote against the government when the Commons debates a substantive motion on Maastricht.</p>

			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Markets: The high costs of 'good' advice - Serious Money A ROUND of applause to the British investing public for seeking out Cazenove's bond and utility fund, which had low initial and annual charges and yielded 7 per cent if held within a personal equity plan. Cazenove says it has raised Pounds 24m; and, although some of the money came from fee-charging financial advisers and some from the firm's own clients, the bulk came from small investors. Fidelity's new income fund, which has a lower yield and higher charges than Cazenove (but still relatively low fees by industry standards), has raised Pounds 15m, mostly from the public. But, of the three funds launched last month, the most money - Pounds 45m - was raised by M&amp;G, which had the highest charges of the three. Its initial charge is 4.5 per cent (0.8 per cent all told on Cazenove), and its annual charge is 1.5 per cent (0.5 per cent at Cazenove). M&amp;G is not being greedy. Its front-end charge is higher than the others because of the commission it is prepared to pay to those who sold the fund. And it says it raised around 30 per cent of its money from independent financial advisers and 70 per cent from the public. The industry can produce as many arguments as it likes for the present system of commission charging, but these recent fund launches show its absurdity. More than half of those who acted on their own opted for the two funds with higher yields and lower charges; those who took 'advice' were, almost exclusively, put into the fund with the lowest yield and the highest charges. You can hardly say that advisers have favoured M&amp;G's fund because it offers monthly income; Fidelity's does, too. Some could argue that M&amp;G's offering, with its higher equity content, might produce better long-term growth in income - although the income will have to grow 40 per cent to catch up with Cazenove while coping with a bigger annual charge. Many contend that charges are irrelevant in the long run; what matters is performance. All well and good, except for two things. Future performance is unknown when an adviser makes a recommendation; the charges are set out clearly in black and white. Second, if two managers buy exactly the same stocks, the one with the lower charges will produce the better return. Buying the fund with low charges tilts the odds in the investor's favour. So, I find it hard to believe that it is sophisticated analysis, and not commission, which has pushed advisers in favour of M&amp;G. It has to be said that Fidelity, while having a lower charging structure, is offering the same 3 per cent commission as M&amp;G; but Cazenove is not paying commission at all. One financial advisory group I met recently said it was not even mentioning Cazenove to its clients, because it would get no money for recommending the plan. Many independent advisers do a good job for their clients; it is better that investors approach them than tied agents. But the system is still crazy. Imagine the outcry if newspapers wrote only about those companies which advertised on their pages. The guidelines for financial advisers published last month by the Financial Intermediaries, Managers and Brokers Regulatory Association (Fimbra) state quite clearly: 'Members must take care to ensure that their recommendations are made on the basis of the client's best interests and not on the basis of the income generated for the member.' Judging by speeches from Andrew Large, chairman of the Securities and Investments Board - the industry's chief regulator - he appreciates that the public is not being served well at the moment. At the FT, we have favoured advice based on fees rather than commission. We believe that paying the adviser yourself is the best way to ensure he acts in your interest and recommends the best products. But our view is not popular in the industry. Commission-based advisers argue that many investors are unwilling to pay fees, and that they have to earn a living somehow. We still believe that many FT readers will have had experience of paying a fee to solicitors and accountants, and will be prepared to do so to an adviser. And if the public is unwilling to pay fees, the more newspapers tell them to do so, the quicker they will come round to the idea. Many investors will prefer to rely on their own counsel, but those who do need to keep on their toes. One alert reader received a mail shot from Sharelink giving him the chance to invest in one of two indexed funds via a personal equity plan. Sharelink's special Pep offer involves an initial charge of just 1.5 per cent plus an annual charge of 0.75 per cent on the Pep. But the sharp-eyed reader noted that one of the plans chosen was Gartmore's UK index fund, which had no initial charge and an annual fee of just 0.5 per cent. The effect of the Sharelink offer was to dilute one of Gartmore's key advantages - its low charges. Furthermore, the Gartmore fund is available via a Pep from London broker WI Carr for just Pounds 30, plus VAT, a year. In its defence, Sharelink points out that it is making the fund available to small investors (the minimum lump sum is Pounds 250, compared with Gartmore's normal Pounds 5,000); that investors can switch into the European index fund for free; and that the overall charge levels are still low. Nevertheless, the special offer is not so special for those who want to invest the full Pounds 6,000. But only a well-informed investor could have worked that out.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Jean-Claude Trichet, governor of the Bank of </F> France, by Jean-Pierre Robin; place and date not given:  "Jean-Claude Trichet: `Interest Rates Will Continue To Drop'"]    [Text] [Robin] The Bank of France has become independent.  In particular, we expected this move to give the bank a greater  credibility vis-a-vis the markets, thus leading to the  possibility of lower interest rates. Has this hope been  realized?    [Trichet] The Bank of France and its Monetary Policy Council  [CPM] have been independent since the law of 4 August was  completed by the law of 31 December. It appears to me that the  franc has benefited by obtaining an increased level of  credibility on all markets. The independence of the central  bank has increased the reliability of a stable monetary policy  required by law, and this has enabled us, for example, to halve  interest rates since the start of 1993. The world and national  markets must be convinced that the wise men on the CPM, charged  by law with ensuring price stability, are making their decisions  in all honesty and with the sole aim of respecting the law in  the interests of our economy.    [Robin] Has not defending the franc within the European  Monetary System [EMS] become an overriding priority, to the  detriment of all other considerations?    [Trichet] The problem cannot be viewed that way. The law  requires that we ensure price stability. Successive governments  have attached a great deal of importance to the EMS exchange  rate mechanism. The work of the CPM is aimed at the following  strategic goal: The final objective is price stability -- less  than 2 percent in future years. On the basis of that, our  initial, intermediate aim is to ensure the stability of the  external value of our currency in the framework of the EMS  exchange rate mechanism, as confirmed by the ministers and  [central bank] governors of the European Union [EU] on 2 August  1993. We also have a domestic monetary aim: the simultaneous  monitoring of the M3 monetary aggregate and of the preferential  indicator of total domestic borrowing.    Leaving aside this technical explanation, I would like to  make one very simple point: The CPM has clearly defined  monetary policy for 1994 and the coming years in the context of  noninflationary growth. This noninflationary growth had yet to  appear by January 1994, the last time we met. It is more  apparent now, as we can see from the INSEE [National Statistics  Office] and Bank of France surveys. For five months now, since  November 1993, company bosses have been telling our surveys that  the economic climate is improving.    [Robin] Is monetary stability compatible with rapid economic  growth?    [Trichet] Yes. I even think, if you take a step back and  look at the situation, that it is a precondition for rapid  growth. Anyway, there is not a single central bank governor who  will state that he is implementing a weak or unstable monetary  policy and who is not in favor of domestic monetary stability.  I do not know anyone who would say that.    [Robin] Even in the United States?    [Trichet] Naturally, the Federal Reserve is no exception. We  are living in a world system which even applies to the countries  of the East and the former Soviet Union. We are really in a  globalized system: If you deliberately project an image of  weakness, you will immediately and quite rightly pay the price.  Any investor in Tokyo, Singapore, or New York would be entitled  to claim a "risk bonus" from a country that tells him he will be  paid in an unstable currency! A responsible monetary strategy  in the current world, and also in the French and European  context, consists in supplementing economic policy with domestic  and foreign currency stability. At the end of the day, this is  the most effective way of obtaining the best level of investment.    [Robin] For the Bundesbank, the stability of the German mark  is seen as a function of a basket of 18 currencies. France,  then, has to ensure the franc-mark parity. Do you not think  that there is a degree of inequality between the positions of  the two countries?    [Trichet] No. The criterion that we use is membership of the  multilateral European exchange rate mechanism, which unites nine  economies and eight different currencies. Germany is a member,  too. We have striven to externalize French monetary strategy --  as we have always done -- by stating our two objectives: an  external aim, i.e., the exchange rate mechanism decided on by  the EU governors and ministers on 2 August, and a domestic aim.  Some countries go about it differently. That does not prevent  these nine economies, including the French and the German  economies, from participating in a multilateral system. It is a  balanced system where all the countries obey the same rules.    [Robin] Since it became independent, is not the Bank of  France even more subjugated to the Bundesbank?    [Trichet] The CPM defined France's monetary policy for 1994  in Paris, and makes its decisions on the basis of this policy in  accordance with the law and in the interests of the French  economy. In Frankfurt, the Bundesbank committee does the same  thing for Germany.    [Robin] At the current time, all European bond markets, and  especially the French one, are suffering from the rise in U.S.  interest rates. Is there not a way we could avoid this domino  effect?    [Trichet] All the markets have been caught up in the storm  blowing in off the Atlantic. If we again take a step back, we  see that the 10-year rates in France are 35 basis points off the  German rates and 10 basis points off the Netherlands rates. In  the general torment, the best performers so far have been the  Germans, followed by the Dutch, with the French in third place.    I have confidence in the main features of the French  economy:  low inflation, a foreign trade surplus, and healthy growth. I  am convinced that the markets, after an understandably shaky  period, will, as they have always done, take these objective  factors into account since they argue the case for France and  for Europe.    [Robin] Can the European central banks continue to cut their  key rates in this world context?    [Trichet] The best way forward is to maintain a credible  policy of monetary stability. You cannot navigate through a  storm on a policy of instability. In these conditions, the  European central banks can continue to cut their key rates if  necessary, in a gradual and cautious way, and despite the rise  in U.S. rates. This is the message that the governors of the  European central banks have already sent out, notably Hans  Tietmayer and myself, at last month's Frankfurt seminar.    [Robin] In the letter that the governor of the Bank of  France  traditionally sends to the president of the Republic along with  the bank's annual report, you express your concern about the  size of the budget deficit. Is this your way of warning the  government?    [Trichet] The French Government, like all its European  counterparts with the exception of the Luxembourg Government,  has launched a medium-term budgetary recovery program. This is  a good move which I applaud. I am convinced that this  multiannual program will be methodically applied because it is  important for the French economy. It is not a question of  overdramatizing the situation: Our government debt today  represents 44 percent of GDP, which is quite low compared with  the European average. However, it is one more reason for us to  maintain this relative advantage!    [Robin] You say that the Bank of France's monetary strategy  makes it possible, under the conditions of the world market, to  have the lowest possible interest rate curve across the whole  range of maturities. Does the level of short rates not  constitute another handicap, especially for small- and  medium-sized companies which have no other means of financing?    [Trichet] This strategy of credibility and stability which  does indeed take into account the whole range of interest rate  curves, is definitely the strategy best suited to the country's  investment requirements. Look at the situation: For our  economy to be as active as possible, many observers or experts  agree that housing and investment are important activating  factors.    In both cases, in France, financing at long- or medium-term  fixed rates plays a key role: 90 percent of housing loans are  made at long- or medium-term fixed rates. These are two  excellent reasons for having a relatively low interest rate  curve for long-term maturities, and this is indeed the case in  France compared with other countries.    Moreover, French households are net creditors, while, in  many  countries, they are debtors. When short-term rates drop,  household incomes tend to fall. I do not think that that is an  argument against cutting short-term rates, which are clearly  also useful for the economy. However, this side of things has  to be taken into account when you compare our monetary policy  with other possible policies.    Naturally, it is still true that our monetary policy has  also  made it possible to cut short-term rates significantly over the  last 12 months by 600 base points, and that has helped small-  and medium-sized companies and industries [SME-SMIs].    [Robin] These SME-SMIs are now complaining more than ever of  a lack of credits. Does this not risk compromising the recovery?    [Trichet] Some polls show that only 7 percent of managers  complain about the cost of credit, much fewer than a year ago.  The problem is therefore perhaps more about gaining access to  credit than its actual cost. Of course, the central banks  cannot be held responsible for that. However, the public  authorities have thought about it and [Economics Minister]  Alphandery has taken steps in this area. I am thinking  especially of the guarantees accompanying SOFARIS [French  Venture Capital company] loans, which could prove extremely  useful at the current time.    [Robin] Are you optimistic about the signs of economic  recovery that has begun in France?    [Trichet] The basic signs are good: We have a good rate of  inflation and a large trade surplus, which means that the French  economy is restarting in very healthy conditions.    [Robin] The government debt, however, is increasing and,  above all, a major share of it is held by foreign investors,  which could frustrate a further reduction in interest rates.    [Trichet] You have to look at our situation in the overall  context. The total government debt, which is 44 percent of GDP,  places us in a very favorable position with regard to the rest  of Europe and the world.    As for French securities (public and private shares and  bonds) held by non-French nationals, they prove the  international nature of our economy. We are the world's fourth  largest exporter, the third largest per capita among the G-7  countries, and one of the leading foreign industrial investors.  The French operate very much on the international level and  perform very well, even if they do not always realize it. This  neither brakes nor accelerates rate cuts. It simply means that,  like all other major economies, we are involved in an  interdependent worldwide system.    [Robin] Tight monetary policy equals unemployment. How do  you respond to this question?    [Trichet] The countries that have been implementing a policy  of monetary stability the longest are today those that are  industrially the most powerful and who have experienced the  highest overall growth: Germany and Japan. France itself,  since it has had this kind of monetary policy, has equaled the  best levels of growth over a long period.    The real question is different: Why does French growth not  create more jobs? This is an extremely complex problem which  does not directly arise out of monetary policy. We have to show  more imagination and make more of an effort to change our  behavior in a number of areas so as to create more jobs for each  "1 percent" of extra growth.    [Robin] How do you explain the intense and continuing public  criticism of monetary policy? Do you sometimes get the  impression that the political world regrets ever having made the  bank independent?    [Trichet] Such criticism is rather a healthy factor in a  democracy. Anyway, it proves that we are indeed independent!  The worse thing for the franc would be if the Bank of France  looked servile, if people sung our praises left and right, which  would mean that the CPM was not really independent. That would  run counter to the law and the interests of the country, since  our independence was decided to increase the credibility of the  franc.    It is therefore a good thing that the bank appears so  independent. However, the independence of the CPM does not mean  we have cut off all contact between the bank and public  officials, the president of the Republic, the prime minister,  the economy minister, and Parliament. On the contrary, these  relations are scrupulously defined by the law and are essential.    Moreover, in a democracy it is the duty of every institution  to listen, reflect, decide, explain, and, if possible, convince.  The Bank of France's CPM will strive to listen as much as  possible to the messages of our economy.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Shi Zhihong (2457 5347 7703) from the "Earnestly </F> Study Volume Three of the Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping" column: "How the 'Chief Architect' Designed  China's `Image'"]    [Text] According to Volume 3 of Selected Works of  Deng Xiaoping,, as the chief architect of China's reform  and opening, Comrade Deng Xiaoping not only scientifically  designed the grand blueprint and fundamental strategy of China's  reform and opening up, but also designed all aspects of our  country's "image" and our national "image." In the book, 12  passages directly discuss the "image" of our country and nation.  Through these discussions, we may clearly see that the issue of  the "image" of our country and nation is an important element in  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's many theoretical viewpoints and major  strategic decisions. It is related to "two revolutions," the  "three-stage" strategic objective, the "one center, two basic  points" conception, the theory of socialism and patriotism,  contemporary China in the nineties, and the future China in the  21st century.  <H5>  I. There Are Three Significant Changes in China's "Image" in </H5> Modern History, at Present, and in the Fifties of the 21st  Century    Comrade Deng Xiaoping's discussions of the "image" of our  country and nation had an unusual viewpoint. That is,  proceeding from the basic position and viewpoint of dialectical  and historical materialism, he closely linked the molding of and  the change in the image of our country and nation with the  revolutionary cause led by our party. In his eyes, the point  that "revolution is for emancipating the productive forces" can,  in a certain sense, find more concrete expression in the point  that revolution is for changing the "image" of our country and  nation. Proceeding from this basic viewpoint, Comrade Deng  Xiaoping held that three major changes of revolutionary  significance have occurred or will occur in China's image in  modern history, at present, and in the fifties of the 21st  century.    The establishment of the PRC was the first "change in  China's  image," and this event showed that "the Chinese people stood  up." In 1984, when meeting a visiting delegation of Hong Kong  businessmen and some Hong Kong celebrities, Comrade Deng  Xiaoping pointed out: "For more than a century after the Opium  War, foreigners looked down on Chinese people and humiliated  Chinese people. Since the founding of the PRC, China's image  has changed." In April 1987, he pointed out more concretely:  "Since the founding of the PRC, China's features have indeed  been changed," and this mainly found expression in the fact that  "the Chinese people had stood up." Comrade Deng Xiaoping said  that this was a significant event. For a country "remaining in  a humble position in the world over more than a century" after  the Opium War, this was certainly a fundamental and historic  change in the image of the country and nation. Being a  revolutionary of the older generation who was an eyewitness and  personal participant in this change, Comrade Deng Xiaoping was  always full of deep feelings and indignation when mentioning  this change. He pointed out: "China became a semifeudal and  semicolonial society after the Opium war, and Chinese people  became well-known in the world as the 'sick man of East Asia.'"  Up to the founding of the PRC, "more than 10 foreign powers  bullied China, and the first was Britain. Earlier than that,  Portugal forcibly leased China's territory of Macao. Japan and  Czarist Russia, including the Soviet Union for a certain period,  gained the greatest benefit from China." "In history, Japan  owes China the largest debt." "Tens of millions of Chinese  people were killed by the Japanese." Czarist Russia seized the  largest area of territory from China, "the Chinese territory  occupied by Czarist Russia through unequal treaties exceeded 1.5  million square km."    So, why could the Chinese people stand up? Comrade Deng  Xiaoping pointed out: "It was not Chiang Kai-shek but the  Communist Party and socialism who enabled the Chinese people to  stand up." He also stressed: "China's current image was not  created by the former Qing Government, nor by the Beiyang  Warlords, nor by Chiang and his son. It was the PRC that changed  China's image." This revealed the true reason for the  tremendous historic changes in this nation which experienced  untold disasters. In the first third of this century, when the  CPC had just mounted the stage of history in China, the country  was being carved up; the Chinese nation was being humiliated and  bullied; the warlords were fighting each other and causing a  chaotic situation; and foreign enemies were driving straight in  to invade our country. The CPC, which mastered the truth of  Marxism and fought indomitably, united the whole Chinese nation  to win victory in the new democratic revolution against  imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. Comrade  Deng Xiaoping said: "In the past, we carried out the new  democratic revolution; after the founding of the PRC, we carried  out the land reform and also carried out socialist  transformation of agriculture, handicraft industry, and  capitalist industry and commerce. We thus laid the socialist  economic base. That was a great revolution, and the revolution  lasted more than 30 years." That is to say, the first  successful "image" change of our country and our nation in  modern history was linked with the first CPC-led revolution,  which was carried out under extremely difficult conditions. The  revolution was one for "selecting a doctrine [zhu yi 0031  5030]." Relying on our people, we selected Marxism and  scientific socialism; and this rescued China, changed China's  conditions, and changed the image of the country and the nation.    The "new revolution" (or second revolution), comprising  reform, opening up, and modernization, led by our party "changed  China's image" for the second time. As Comrade Deng Xiaoping  said, "after the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central  Committee, the image of our country changed." The second "image  change" was mainly reflected in the fact that "China became more  active" and "the economy was developed"; moreover, in the  changeable international situation, China "stood firm" like an  unshakable rock. From the first image change, which found  expression in the fact that "the Chinese people stood up," to  the second image change, which found expression in the fact that  "China's socialism stood firm," the process not only reflected  the in-depth advances of the Chinese revolution, but also showed  that the Chinese Communists more broadly and deeply changed  China's "image."    Why did our country and nation still face the issue of the  second "image" change? The reasons can be found in two aspects.  On the one hand, the first revolution in our country just  solved the issue of "rescuing China." Only by overthrowing the  three big mountains that oppressed the Chinese people could the  Chinese people stand up. After the task of "rescuing China" was  fulfilled, "developing China" became the main issue. On the  other hand, we underwent many twists and turns on the issue of  "developing China." As Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out when  summing up the positive and negative experience since the  founding of the PRC, the twists and turns were mainly reflected  in the fact that "after the establishment of the socialist  economic base, we did not formulate policies for creating  favorable conditions for the development of the productive  forces over many years. The productive forces in society  developed slowly; the people's material and cultural lives were  not properly improved; and the state could not shake off the  condition of poverty and backwardness. This state of affairs  forced us to carry out reform. The general principle was to  uphold four things. The issue was how to uphold these things.  Should we maintain the policies that could not enable us to  shake off poverty and backwardness or should we select good  policies on the basis of adhering to the four cardinal  principles so that the social productive forces could be  developed faster? The reform after the Third Plenary Session of  the 11th CPC Central Committee was aimed at selecting such good  policies." These remarks accurately answered why it was  necessary to carry out the second revolution of reform, opening  up, and modernization after the victory of the first revolution  in our country; and also correspondingly answered why it was  necessary for our country and nation to change the "image" for  the second time.    If the victory of the first revolution in our country was  linked with the correct selection of the "doctrine," then the  great successes in the second revolution were related to the  correct selection of the "policies." In the late eighties and  early nineties, socialism with Chinese characteristics could  "stand firm" in the changeable international situation, and the  fundamental reason was that after the Third Plenary Session of  the 11th CPC Central Committee, according to Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's proposal, our party carried out the second revolution  through reselecting policies and rebuilding the institutional  structure. The so-called "policy reselection" means the  "formulation of new political, economic, and social policies"  and a series of other "new principles and policies. The central  point was to change from taking class struggle as the key link  to taking the development of productive forces as the central  task, from being closed to opening up, and from staying in a rut  to carrying out reform." The new policies were effective in  bringing about the rapid development of the socialist social  productive forces in our country. The comprehensive national  strength of our country grew to a new level, and the people's  living standards were markedly enhanced. Therefore, the policies  were supported by the vast majority of the Chinese people. "The  people have their personal experience, and their eyes are  discerning. In the past, they could not have enough food and  clothing; today, they can have not only enough food and  clothing, but also modern household appliances. The people are  glad." As the first revolution led by our party profoundly  changed China's "image," the second revolution led by our party  also brought about great changes in the "features" of our  country. Comrade Deng Xiaoping often described the new changes  in the "image" of our country and nation in a delighted tone and  style and expressed the same feelings as the people. For  example, he said: "In the more than five years after the Third  Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, very good  changes indeed occurred. The image of our country has changed,  and this has been discerned by our people and also noticed by  the international community." "The people's livelihood has  indeed been improved," "the nation has become more prosperous,  and is enjoying higher international prestige." "The features  of the whole country are greatly different," and there is a  "prosperous scene" everywhere. The people are "faring better  year after year." He summed up all such changes by saying that  "reform and opening up have actually invigorated China." The  invigoration was reflected in all aspects, not only in the  ideological aspect, but also in the economic, social, political,  and cultural aspects. Invigoration brought about greater  dynamism, and dynamism ensures the continuation of life.    In the middle of next century, when China achieves the  third-stage strategic objective of modernization, China's  "image" will undergo the third change, which will be marked by  the fact that the Chinese nation will "stand steadfastly among  other nations of the world" with a brand-new image of  "prosperity, powerfulness, democracy, and civilization." After  the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee,  Comrade Deng Xiaoping often told people about the bright  prospects for China in the middle of next century. He said:  "From 1981 to the end of this century, the economy will be  quadrupled in 20 years and will reach the level of being  comparatively well-off. That is, the annual per capita GNP will  increase to $800 to $1,000. On the basis of this achievement,  it will increase to $4,000 in another 50 years. What does that  mean? That is to say, by the middle of next century, we will  reach the level of an intermediately developed country." "It  will be a significant matter that a country with a population of  1.5 billion people reaches the level of an intermediately  developed country." "It will be extremely unusual if our country  is built into an intermediately developed country in a period of  100 years from the founding of the PRC." The revolutionary of  the older generation, who had reached an advanced age, always  directed his eyes toward the middle of the 21st century. This  showed that he was always considering what kind of China should  be brought into the 21st century. As mentioned above, the 19th  century witnessed China's decline; the 20th century recorded the  Chinese nation's struggle for regeneration; while the 21st  century will mark the Chinese nation's reinvigoration and  prosperity. Therefore, Comrade Deng Xiaoping repeatedly  stressed: "Now, people say that marked changes are occurring in  China. I told some foreign guests that the current changes are  just minor changes. Quadrupling production and reaching the  level of being comparatively well-off will just be an  intermediate change. The major change will come when we  approach the level of a developed nation in the world by the  middle of next century." He summarized the essence of the third  "image" change, which is of far-reaching significance, in our  country and our nation by saying that "since the Chinese people  have the ability to stand up, they will certainly have the  ability to stand firm among other nations of the world."    Thus, we can clearly see that the three changes of great  significance in China's "image" in modern history, at present,  and in the fifties of the 21st century are mainly reflected in  "standing up [zhan qi lai 4541 6386 0171]," "standing firm [zhan  zhu le 4541 0145 0055]," and "standing steadfastly among others  [kui ran yi li 8354 3544 1473 4539]." This is the general  "image" designed by the "chief architect" for our country and  nation according to the objective law that governs historical  development.  <H5>  II. The Five "Images" With Distinct Chinese Characteristics </H5> That China Will Show to the World at Present and in the Future    Comrade Deng Xiaoping not only designed the general "image"  of our country and nation, but also carefully designed the  concrete "image" of contemporary China and future China. The  concrete "image" designs fully express his scientific theories  and strategic conceptions. Therefore, understanding these  concrete "images" will also help us better master the scientific  system of his theories. In Comrade Deng Xiaoping's concrete  designs, contemporary China and future China will mainly show  five "images" to the world:    First, China "will give an image of reform and opening up to  the international community and to the people." This was  repeatedly stressed by Comrade Deng Xiaoping after the political  storm at the turn of spring and summer in 1989. He mentioned  this sometimes from the angle of the leading body and sometimes  from the angle of leaving an impression with people at home and  abroad. For example, he said: "It is necessary to organize a  central leading body with the image of reform and opening up so  that the people can set their minds at rest." "China must have  a leading collective with an image of reform and opening up."  He also stressed that China "should give an image of reform and  opening up to the international community and to the people, and  this is of great importance." It should be pointed out that his  remarks were all uttered for the purpose of "giving a political  explanation," so they were of unusual significance.    Why did China have to always maintain the "image" of reform  and opening up? Comrade Deng Xiaoping first considered this  according to the state interests and the people's interests. He  pointed out that with regard to the general orientation and the  major policy of reform and opening up, "the international  community was worried that we might backtrack from this" and  "the people were worried that we might change this." Therefore,  "we should do a number of things to show that our policy of  reform and opening up remains unchanged and that we shall  further open up more broadly." "It is necessary to give  expression to reform and opening up, to large-scale opening up."  "There should be opening up on a larger scale than before."  "The banner of opening up must be unfurled." Thus, we shall not  only "make the people set their minds at rest," but also  eliminate various misgivings and conjectures in the  international community.    In addition, Comrade Xiaoping  stressed that China must maintain the "image" of reform and  opening according to the viewpoint of acting according to the  objective laws. As compared with the period of the Eighth CPC  Congress, our party now much more profoundly understands the  laws governing socialist construction in our country. For  example, we are now aware that "reform is China's second  revolution"; "persistently carrying out reform and continuing  opening up is a move that determines China's destiny"; "reform  and opening up is the only way to develop China's productive  forces"; "without upholding socialism, without reform and  opening, and without improving the people's livelihood, there  will only be a blind alley." All this represents our awareness  of the objective regularity. Respecting the objective laws,  Comrade Deng Xiaoping repeatedly told the whole party that  "reform and opening up is a fundamental principle that must not  be given up"; "even if there is trouble [feng bo 7364 3134] or  big trouble in the future, reform must still be continued;  otherwise, there will be no way out in the next decade"; "reform  and opening should still be advocated, and should be advocated  for several decades"; "an important point is that China must not  be turned back into a closed country"; "we must never return to  the previous course and stifle the economy"; "if we backtracked  to the previous course, we would just return to the condition of  poverty and backwardness." He also summarized all this, which  represents the understanding of the objective regularity that  can be expressed in innumerable words, into two phrases. That  is, "carrying out reform without indulging in controversy, and  opening up without closing the door."    Second, it is necessary to strive to create the "image" of  an  "economic power." This is also a point that Comrade Deng  Xiaoping is always concerned about and has repeatedly stressed.  He said many times: "China is a big country and also a small  country. Being a big country, it has a huge population and vast  territory; being a small country, it remains a developing  country and remains rather poor." "China is a small country in  real terms and is also a big country in real terms; China is one  of the permanent members of the UN Security Council," and this  shows that China "is now a political power." "The PRC will  become an economic power in not too long a period." The  so-called "economic power" means that we shall enhance our  comprehensive national strength, "turn a poor China into a  comparatively well-off China" and "turn a backward China into a  developed China" so that we can "solve the issue of poverty  among 1 billion people and solve the development issue of 1  billion people" and can prove the superiority of socialism with  facts. When turmoil occurred in some countries, Comrade Deng  Xiaoping cool-headedly pointed out: "When these countries were  bogged down in turmoil, China was really planning the  realization of the second quadrupling, and this was another  success of socialism. If we basically realize modernization by  the fifties of next century, then we can more definitely  announce socialism's successfulness." Of course, Comrade Deng  Xiaoping also repeatedly stressed that while creating an  "economic power," we do not intend to seek hegemony; instead, we  shall fulfill our duties. "We are bearing our responsibilities,  and we should be responsible to the one-fifth of the world's  population and enable them to live better by developing the  economy." He warned us: "Do not boast, we should be more  modest as our country is becoming more developed." "China does  not seek hegemony now, and will not seek hegemony after it  becomes developed in the future." "If China, with a population  of 1 billion, does not adhere to a policy of peace, does not  oppose hegemonism, or even pursues hegemonism as its economy  becomes developed, that would be a disaster for the world and  would be retrogression in history."    Third, it is necessary to "give an image of stability and  unity to the international community and to people at home."  Therefore, we repeatedly stressed the need to establish the  image of stability and unity, and this is first of all based on  historical experience. Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: "We should  let foreigners see that China is stable. If the country is made  chaotic and disintegrated, will there still be any hope? In the  past, the imperialists bullied us because our nation was just  like a sheet of loose sand." Second, stressing stability and  unity is also based on the lesson drawn from the negative  experience in reality. At present, some countries in the world  are bogged down in endless turmoil and civil war, and we learn a  lesson from their negative experience and we know that a nation  cannot make advances in turmoil, and development is possible  only in a stable environment. At present, "China is situated in  the process of economic development and in this period attention  must be concentrated on economic development." "In order to  realize the four modernizations in China and to free China from  poverty and backwardness, we must have a political situation of  unity and stability and must ensure that construction is being  conducted in an orderly way under effective leadership. Any  trouble in society may prevent us from concentrating on economic  construction." If there are demonstrations, debates, and big  posters in the streets from time to time, people will not be  able to concentrate their energy on construction. Moreover, if  any trouble and unrest occur in society, the domestic situation  will become unstable, and "foreign funds will not come into our  country. We should more strictly exercise control in this  regard. This will not affect foreign investment; on the  contrary, foreign investors will become more confident." In  this sense, Comrade Deng Xiaoping stressed: "We handled a  number of people who advocated liberalization and violated the  criminal law several years ago. China's image was not harmed;  instead, our reputation is getting better day by day."    Stability and unity includes the two aspects of stability  and unity. Stability [an ding 1344 1353] is a matter in society  as a whole, and this is sometimes also called steadiness [wen  ding 4489 1353]. In this connection, Comrade Deng Xiaoping  uttered a lot of remarks. For example, he said: "It is  necessary to issue a signal to show that no turmoil is allowed  in China." "Stability is an overwhelming requirement." He also  said: "We must eliminate all factors that oppose our taking,  and obstruct us from taking, the socialist road and all factors  that may cause chaos or even turmoil for China." As for unity,  this is mainly a matter within the decisionmaking body and  within the leadership, especially the central leading core.  Comrade Deng Xiaoping stated seriously that in China, "the most  important thing is to maintain a united leading core." "As long  as no problem occurs in this link, China will be as stable as  the Tai Shan. The international community will not look down on  us, and more and more people will come to China to make  investment." "As long as the leading collective is united and  insists on reform and opening up, even if we develop stably for  several decades, China will still undergo a fundamental change."  We should give deep thought to all these earnest instructions.    Fourth, it is necessary to keep the image of developing the  two civilizations in a well-coordinated way. Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's designing of the image of our country and nation was  comprehensive. He said that the superiority of socialism should  be brought into play in all aspects, and required that we  "should not only boost economic development, but should also  improve public order and public conduct." Only when the two  civilizations surpass capitalist society can this be called  socialism with Chinese characteristics. According to this basic  point of view, he not only deeply hated the phenomena that  smeared the national dignity and personal dignity, slurred the  "image" of socialism and the "image" of our country and nation,  but also repeatedly demanded that the whole party adopt severe  measures to suppress and prevent such phenomena. He stressed  the need to continuously "eliminate various ugly and evil  phenomena" and "resolutely resist and eliminate the phenomena of  corruption." The phenomena of greed, corruption, and unfairness  and such things as drug-consumption, prostitution, and economic  crime must not be allowed to exist and spread in China. Our  youngsters must not be captured by bourgeois ideology. He  pointed out in a clear-cut way that "spiritual pollution must  not be allowed on the front of ideology," and "the situation in  which young people are being influenced by the decadent culture  of the Western bourgeoisie must not be tolerated any longer."  He stressed that efforts should be made to develop spiritual  civilization and to foster a new generation of socialist people  "with lofty ideals, moral integrity, good education, and a sense  of discipline." In view of the situation of "paying attention  only to material civilization while neglecting spiritual  civilization" before the 4 June Incident, he repeatedly stressed  the need to "promote both civilizations at the same time by  doing effective work [liang shou zhua liang shou dou yao ying  0357 2087 2119 0357 2087 6757 6008 4289]."    Fifth, it is necessary to "safeguard our image of being  independent and being unafraid of evil spirits [bu xin xie bu pa  gui 0008 0207 6723 0008 1830 7607]." Comrade Deng Xiaoping  mentioned this point as a basic principle for China's foreign  policy, and took it as our nation's lofty aspiration. He  repeatedly mentioned that being independent and self-reliant is  our foothold in the past, at present, and in the future. He  also stressed that China is now a poor country, but why can it  hold the position of a pole in the multipolar pattern of the  world? Because we do not act according to other peoples' orders  and do not sit on other people's chariots; instead, we are an  independent country. "Why do we say that we are independent?  Because we insist on the socialist road with Chinese  characteristics."    Persisting in independence and self-determination is closely  linked with the position of opposing hegemonism and power  politics. In the late eighties and early nineties, there was a  furious countercurrent in the world, and the imperialist Western  world tried to force us to give up socialism and slide into the  capitalist road through peaceful evolution, thus finally  subjecting ourselves to the rule of international monopoly  capital. Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out sternly out of a  sense of justice: "Now, we must resist the countercurrent with  a clear-cut attitude." "China can never be intimidated."  "Those who try to interfere with us and threaten us will  eventually fail. The Chinese people have self-confidence, and a  sense of inferiority will get us nowhere. In the past, our  nation felt itself inferior for more than a century, and stood  up under the leadership of the CPC. The huge monster is rather  frightening, we Chinese people are not afraid of it." "The  Chinese people are not afraid of being isolated and will not be  frightened by evil spirits." "In the world, China is the nation  that is the least afraid of isolation, blockades, and  sanctions." He required of the whole party and the entire  people throughout the country that "we must not be weak." It  was against such a background that Comrade Deng Xiaoping called  for "keeping the image of being independent and being unafraid  of evil spirits." During the past years, the sanctions imposed  by the West on our country have been broken through, and this  fully demonstrated the power of our policy of being independent  and being unafraid of evil spirits. In the future, we must  continue to pass on the fearless national spirit from generation  to generation as the mental force of our nation, and should  safeguard our nation's independence and continue to be unafraid  of evil spirits, external pressure, and threats at any time,  thus making indomitable efforts to reinvigorate our great nation.</p>

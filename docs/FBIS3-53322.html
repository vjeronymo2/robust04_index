			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary prepared by the News Research and Commentaries </F> Group]    [Text] The killing of 18 Algerian Government officials,  including the governor of Tlemcen and his bodyguards in an  attack on their convoy carried out by the opposition, is one  sign that the balance of power between the government and the  opposition in Algeria is shifting. The attack on a convoy  consisting of several cars that were heavily guarded in broad  daylight shows that the attackers are well organized and armed  and that their number was probably double the number of the  government officials who were killed.    Political observers believe that the intensification of  anti-state operations and the lack of popular support for the  government, as well as the dichotomy in the Army, which is the  only institution that supports the ruling military council, have  questioned the Algerian Government's capability to control the  current crisis in the country. The Muslims, the most powerful  opposition group in Algeria, are becoming stronger each day and  their strongholds in provinces and villages are increasing.    The Islamists have recently set up checkpoints in some of  the  areas they control. Also, they have complete control at night  over other areas where the government's presence in the daytime  is not very strong. The Algerian interior minister admits that  at night the cities of Blida and Sidi Bel Abbes and the  Djidjelli forest areas in eastern and western Algeria are  completely under the control of the opposition.    The shift in the balance of power in Algeria between the  government and the opposition--which is happening on the eve of  the reopening of negotiations between the government and the  political parties, with the exception of the Islamic Salvation  Front, to determine the interim government's authority--reveals  that the talks cannot be successful without the participation of  the Islamists, who are the main actors in Algeria's political  scene. The Islamists, who showed in the elections two years ago  that they enjoy extensive popular support, are a determining  force and ignoring them cannot end the Algerian crisis. In  other words, omitting the Islamists from negotiations on  determining the authority and special characteristics that the  interim government will have means that the future situation  will not be better than the current situation and that there  should be no hope that the Algerian crisis will end.</p>

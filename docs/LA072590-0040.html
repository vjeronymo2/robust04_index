			<p><P> July 25, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROBBER WHO SURVIVED SHOOT-OUT THAT KILLED 3 ACCOMPLICES IS JAILED 17 YEARS  </P> <P> A robber who survived a police shoot-out that left his three accomplices dead  outside a McDonald's restaurant in Sunland was sentenced Tuesday to 17 years in  prison for a string of holdups of fast-food businesses.  </P> <P> Alfredo Olivas, 19, of Hollywood pleaded guilty June 15 to 10 robbery counts  after prosecutors dropped three counts of murder, which were filed against him  under a state law that holds lawbreakers responsible for deaths that occur  during the commission of their crimes.  </P> <P> As part of a plea agreement, prosecutors also dropped two kidnaping and seven  other felony counts and agreed not to seek a prison term longer than 17 years.  </P> <P> Olivas, who was wounded in the Feb. 12 shoot-out, faced two life sentences if  convicted of the kidnaping charges alone and could have been sentenced to death  if convicted of the murder counts, Deputy Dist. Atty. Kenneth L. Barshop said.  </P> <P> Prosecutors said they did not have enough evidence to prove that Olivas  provoked the shoot-out, which occurred after Olivas and the other men robbed a  McDonald's on Foothill Boulevard of more than $10,000.  </P> <P> Investigators said that members of the Los Angeles Police Department's Special  Investigations Section fired 35 rounds at the men after Olivas allegedly  pointed a gun at the officers, who were approaching the suspects' parked car  after observing them commit the after-hours robbery.  </P> <P> The SIS officers had been shadowing the men in connection with a series of as  many as 17 robberies of fast-food restaurants allegedly carried out by the  group in the Los Angeles area between August, 1989, and the Feb. 12 shoot-out  in Sunland.  </P> <P> San Fernando Superior Court Judge John H. Major on Tuesday granted Olivas'  request to be sent to state prison rather than serve part of his sentence in a  California Youth Authority facility, an option that was offered because of his  age. Olivas said he believed that he would be the victim of gang violence if  sent to a juvenile facility.  </P> <P> "I'm not a violent person," Olivas told Major. "I know I did wrong for doing  these kinds of robberies. I know I'm going to pay for it, but I want to do it  as calmly and peacefully as possible."  </P> <P> But Barshop said Olivas acted violently, even though the defendant and the  other suspects carried unloaded pellet guns during the robberies.  </P> <P> Barshop said Olivas participated in at least four of the robberies committed by  the group. The prosecutor said that on at least two occasions, the group  kidnaped managers of McDonald's restaurants from their homes, drove them to the  restaurants after hours and forced them to open safes at gunpoint. Also, Olivas  admitted handcuffing Robin Cox, manager of the Sunland McDonald's, who was then  forced to give the men the combination to the store's safe, Barshop said.  </P> <P> "Mr. Olivas states he went in there with a gun," Barshop said. "Why did he go  in there with a gun but to cause terror to Ms. Cox?"  </P> <P> Olivas' lawyer, Deputy Public Defender Howard C. Waco, said the nine SIS  officers who shot Olivas and his companions carried out an "assassination." He  said that according to police reports of the shooting, two of the officers shot  two suspects at point-blank range from behind as they sat in the parked getaway  car.  </P> <P> Waco also said the officers could not have seen inside the vehicle because it  had tinted windows, which were rolled up when the shooting broke out.  </P> <P> But Major, while not disputing the police report, said the officers acted  appropriately.  </P> <P> "What would the police be expected to do under those circumstances?" Major  asked. "I don't think we can really place any blame on the police officers.  </P></p>

They are fairly new, but it seems every time I boil something in them  they turn black.  </P> <P> I usually end up scrubbing them with steel wool, but they still don't look so  great. Any ideas?  </P> <P>  -- MRS. B., Dallas  </P> <P> DEAR MRS. B.: Don't scrub one more minute. You can easily clean them with cream  of tartar that you'll find at the supermarket in the spice department.  </P> <P> Simply fill the pan with water up to the rim and add about one tablespoon per  quart and bring it to a boil. You'll see the black disappear before your eyes.  </P> <P>  -- HELOISE  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: Last week I volunteered to bake a few cakes for my church. I  thought I had four cake pans, but I remembered after I mixed the batter that I  only had two left. I couldn't get to the store to buy more so I improvised. I  found two stainless-steel mixing bowls and filled them with batter and put them  in the oven to bake.  </P> <P> I was really surprised to see that they turned out beautifully. I put them  upside-down on a cake plate and put icing over them. I actually got compliments  on my unusual-shaped cakes.  </P> <P>  -- DORIS, Portland, Ore.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: My husband is so clever, I wanted to share this hint with you.  </P> <P> I put a pot of boiling water on top of my kitchen countertop. It made a  terrible brown burn mark. I knew we couldn't afford to replace the countertop,  so I thought I'd have to live with it.  </P> <P> My husband is a carpenter by trade, and he bought a 12x12-inch cutting board  and cut the burned area out and replaced it with the cutting board. He trimmed  all four sides with a stainless-steel trim. It looks beautiful and really comes  in handy.  </P> <P>  -- AMY, Toledo, Ohio  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I used to use a powdered coffee creamer in my coffee until I took  a minute to read the ingredients. Did you know that most of them contain  coconut, palm or other oils that are very high insaturated fats?  </P> <P> I found a much healthier substitute: low-fat dry milk. I not only save money,  but also calories.  </P> <P>  -- JOYCE, Phoenix  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I have a couple of young children and am very conscious of their  safety. It only takes a second for a child to get hurt in a kitchen.  </P> <P> When my first child started exploring, I made sure all my cleaning products  were stored in a top cabinet. I used to keep knives in a drawer, but not any  more. I bought a nice knife rack and hung it on my cabinet door. It's  convenient and out of my children's reach.  </P> <P> I also put safety covers on all the electrical outlets. Young children can grab  just about any small object and stick it into an outlet.  </P> <P> My stove has knobs on the front that makes it dangerous for small children. I  got in the habit of keeping the knobs off until I use the stove. All I have to  do is push them on, and when I'm finished I remove them and keep them in a  basket on my countertop.  </P> <P>  -- GINA, Miami  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: We have an automatic drip coffee maker in our office. The coffee  tastes great as soon as it's done, but an hour later it tastes burned and old.  </P> <P> Is there anything wrong with this coffee maker or does this happen with all of  them?  </P> <P>  -- CAROL, Roanoke, Va.  </P> <P> DEAR CAROL: We get a lot of complaints about coffee tasting stale only after an  hour or so. When you keep the pot on the heating element, it seems to cook the  coffee rather than just keep it hot. In our office, as soon as the coffee is  brewed we take what we want and put the rest in a thermos. It keeps it fresh  tasting and hot for quite a few hours.  </P> <P> You can pick one up that holds about eight to 10 cups. I found one in a local  department store that is just beautiful and its made for coffee, tea or cold  drinks.  </P> <P>  -- HELOISE  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: My family loves corned beef and cabbage, but we can't stand the  odor of cabbage cooking. Any ideas on how to eliminate the smell?  </P> <P>  -- BETTY, Dallas  </P> <P> DEAR BETTY: You can help eliminate the odor by adding some vinegar to the water  while boiling it. Vinegar has a multitude of uses and its versatility makes it  an indispensable product.  </P> <P>  -- HELOISE  </P> <P> DEAR READERS: Industries have improved tamper-resistant packaging and continue  to seek better and safer ways to package medicines. However, we as consumers  should also do our part to guard against criminal tampering with  over-the-counter medicines.  </P> <P> Always inspect the outer packaging, and examine the product inside when you  open it at home.  </P> <P> Never take medicines in the dark or in poor lighting. Look at the label and the  medicine every time you take a dose.  </P> <P> Before taking any medication, it is very important to always inspect it for any  signs of change in appearance, whether it is in liquid, tablet or capsule form  or in a tube or jar. Remember, not every change in the appearance or condition  of a product means that the package has been tampered with.  </P> <P> The change could have been made by the manufacturer or the product may have had  rough or unusual handling in shipping. Or changes can occur in medications that  have been opened, used, then stored for long periods of time at home (check the  expiration date). Also, some minor product variations may be normal.  </P> <P> If you suspect anything to be out of the ordinary, take it to the pharmacist or  the manager of the store where it was purchased and have them look at it. If  indeed there is a genuine problem with the product, they will report it to the  U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  </P> <P> To be on the safe side, never use a product that shows evidence of tampering or  that just doesn't seem right. It's not worth taking a chance.  </P> <P>  -- HELOISE  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: My husband and I go to our favorite Chinese restaurant at least  once a month. We have found a great recycling hint for the disposable wooden  chopsticks.  </P> <P> They make great sturdy plant stakes for indoor potted plants that need a lift  or a little support.  </P> <P>  -- J.G., Dallas  </P></p>

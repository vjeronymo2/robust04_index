			<p>BFN     [Text] Geneva, June 7 (TANJUG) -- Special United Nations  (U.N.) envoy for former Yugoslavia [words indistinct] said at  the U.N. headquarters in Geneva late on Tuesday evening that the  talks on a ceasefire in Bosnia-Herzegovina would continue  tomorrow, despite great difficulties. Akashi also announced  meetings with the Moslem-Croat delegation and with Bosnian Serb  President Radovan Karadzic on Wednesday. This means that a  plenary session will again not be held on Wednesday, in all  probability.    Akashi confirmed to reporters that Bosnian Serbs had  accepted  a four-month ceasefire as proposed in a declaration adopted by  the contact group for Bosnia-Herzegovina in Geneva on May 13.  The latest Moslem proposal for a ceasefire is four weeks plus  four weeks, Akashi said, but did not elaborate on the stand of  the U.N., which is the mediator in the peace talks, regarding  these proposals.</p>

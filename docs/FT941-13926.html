			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: Trouble on two wheels - All bikes are becoming harder to insure Four wheels are good, but two wheels can be better, especially in city traffic jams. More and more people are taking to motorcycles and bicycles to get to work or get around. But thieves are also keen on bikes: they are left in the open for hours at a time, are easy to sell for a quick profit, and provide built-in getaway transport. The fashion for expensive mountain bikes and lots of accessories has added to the temptation. BICYCLES Finding an insurer to cover your bicycle for an affordable price is becoming increasingly difficult, particularly if you live in one of the cycle crime blackspots. London, Bristol, Oxford and Cambridge are among the areas where insurers are no longer enthusiastic about providing cover. 'Bristol for some reason is almost a Bermuda triangle for cycles,' says Elaine Court, of AUA Insurance in Norwich, one of the few remaining insurers with a stand-alone bicycle policy. It no longer covers cycles in central Bristol, Cambridge, Oxford, Manchester, Southall, or anywhere with a London postcode. Residents of other areas are divided into three premium categories. So a bike worth between Pounds 350 and Pounds 400, owned by someone living in a rural area, would cost Pounds 37.50 a year to insure, while a person living in Croydon would pay Pounds 56.25 to cover the same bike. Children and students are excluded. Students have a tough time getting insurance from most specialists: their claim levels are twice as high as normal, according to West Mercia Insurance Services, of Wombourne, near Wolverhampton. It will not cover students aged 18-25, although its partner firm, Harrison Beaumont, will cover cycles as part of a student possessions insurance policy. The other possibility for students is to get their parents' home contents insurer to extend cover to their term-time address. One firm which used to specialise in cycle insurance is almost giving up. Graham Brown Insurance Brokers will not be taking on new cycle business because of unexpectedly high levels of claims, although existing customers will still be covered. Some of the cycling organisations, such as the Cyclists Touring Club, in Godalming, Surrey, and the London Cycling Campaign, still have insurance schemes for their members, though it is becoming more difficult to get such schemes underwritten. The CTC also offers travel cover for cyclists touring abroad. Theft or damage are not the only problems faced by cyclists. If you cause an accident with a car, or hit a pedestrian, they could sue you for damages. Most cycle insurance policies cover legal liability, but personal accident cover (for any injuries you suffer) is usually extra. Security is a consideration. The invincible cycle lock is yet to be invented, but insurers will not be sympathetic if you use only a flimsy chain. Some will not cover you for leaving your bike outside all night, or if you leave it chained up outside work all day. Make sure your pattern of use is covered before buying a policy. The majority of cyclists opt for cover under their home contents insurance, which can work out cheaper than a specialist policy. For example, General Accident's main home policy covers bikes worth up to Pounds 200. After that they have to be specified, and an additional premium paid, ranging from Pounds 3.20 to Pounds 5 per Pounds 100, depending on the area. Many insurers impose a limit on the value of bikes they will insure, often somewhere between Pounds 500 and Pounds 1,000. Home contents policies often include an element of personal liability cover as well - check that yours does. But be warned: your cycle is probably your highest-risk possession, and a string of claims will put a black mark on your insurance record. It could cost you more than the cycles were worth. Your premiums may rocket, or you may have to accept a high excess, and if you try to change insurers, you may be turned down. The alternative is to follow Lord Justice Scott's example - buy a cheap undistinguished bicycle and do not insure it. Even if you have to replace it every year or two, it could work out cheaper overall, particularly as an old rust-heap is less likely to be stolen than snazzier modern models. MOTORCYCLES Motorcyclists have also seen premiums rise steeply in recent years. Norwich Union, which has the largest share of the motorcycle insurance market, stopped covering younger bikers a few years ago because claim levels were so high. Now it has introduced a new rating system which it hopes will make premiums better matched to risks, and has started offering comprehensive cover for the under-28s again. Traditionally, motorcycles were rated on a combination of rider's age, address and size of engine. The exact model or value of the motorcycle was not taken into consideration. With modern motorcycles, however, there can be large differences in performance, value and expense of repairs between models with the same engine capacity. Norwich's new Premier Bike policy assigns motorcycles to one of 17 groups, in the same way that cars are underwritten, depending on the model, its price and so on. It also pays attention to the driver's age and address. Allen Burton, of the Birmingham-based Motorcycle Action Group, says even this rating system may not give a true reflection of risks. For example, Burton says age is not an accurate guide to accident risk: experience is more important. Many weekend bikers in their 30s and 40s, may have less experience than a 20-year-old, and so are more likely to crash. MAG introduced an insurance scheme for its members six months ago, and has been able to negotiate lower premiums, as MAG members are likely to be more experienced than average. The premiums depend on experience, and the model of motorcycle, taking into account its value and attractiveness to thieves, and also how expensive it is to repair. Traditional-style motorcycles such as Harley Davidsons can be cheaper to repair than many modern Japanese motorcycles, unless they are vintage models for which parts are difficult to find. Streamlined modern motorcycles often have 'fairings' - plastic or fibreglass shells around the front wheel and handlebars - which can crack in even minor accidents, and have to be replaced whole, at a cost of about Pounds 1,000, Burton says. A Harley might only sustain a minor dent in the same circumstances. However, Harleys are highly attractive to criminals, so their overall premium rate is still high.</p>

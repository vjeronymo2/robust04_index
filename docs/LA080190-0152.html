			<p><P> August 1, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> OLYMPICS CLEARS BUDGET HURDLE  </P> <P> Norway's Olympic committee approved a pared-down final budget of $1.1 billion  for the 1994 Winter Games in an effort to meet state demands for cost cuts.  </P> <P> Olympic planners last week presented a final budget of $1.2 billion, but  Culture Minister Eleonore Bjartveit said the costs had to be reduced.  </P> <P> Even with the cuts, the proposed budget is more than triple the original cost  projections of two years ago.  </P> <P> Olympic committee President Gerhard Heiberg said 7.5% was cut from last week's  estimate to meet the $1.1-billion limit set by Norway's Parliament last  December. He said the difference would be made up with increased revenue.  </P> <P> The rising cost of the Lillehammer games, estimated at $322 million only two  years ago, has stirred debate in this nation of 4.2 million people.  </P> <P> Organizers have said the price cannot be cut if Norway is to adhere to its plan  of staging all events near the town of Lillehammer in southeast Norway. The  plan was a key factor in the city's bid.  </P></p>

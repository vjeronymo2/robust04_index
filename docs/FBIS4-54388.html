			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Message from Dr. Sein Win, prime minister of the National </F> Coalition Government of the Union of Burma, to the Burmese  people on the 4th anniversary of the multiparty general  election--recorded]    [Text] Dear parents and people: I am very grateful for the  opportunity to convey my message to you through the Democratic  Voice of Burma on this important occasion, the 4th anniversary  of the 1990 general election. At this important moment, it is  right for the everyone, including the defense services  personnel, to ask the following questions: What is happening in  our country? Who are the persons most responsible for what is  going on in the country? What caused these things to happen?  How can the country be extricated from these crises?    The political, economic, and social conditions have been  deteriorating. Burma has been listed as the least developed  nation in the world and the poorest nation in Asia. Amid these  political crises, the government which the people are demanding  and yearning for is yet to emerge. The people are facing social  problems and human right violations.    Dear parents and people: Who are the persons most  responsible for these events? It could not denied that General  Ne Win, Senior General Saw Maung, the present generals and  colonels of the State Law and Order Restoration Council, and  SLORC Chairman Sr. Gen. Than Shwe, the leaders of the military  clique which have been ruling Burma for 30 years, are  responsible for these events. These events took place because  they took the wrong path after the 1962 coup. They practiced the  Burmese way to socialism, which said the precepts could be  observed only when the belly is full. In the end, the people  have reached the point where they cannot fill their bellies nor  observe the basic precepts of everyday life.    Dear parents and people: The Defense Services is interfering  in government administration and economy, which are irrelevant  to the Defense Services, while going astray from its original  responsibilities of defending the nation and fulfilling the  desires of the people. The generals, colonels, and former  military officers are also taking the high official positions.  It is the beginning of the destruction of the country. Instead  of resolving the political problems by political means, the  Defense Services is increasing the military budget excessively  and (?establishing militarism in the country). Now the generals  have also created their own dollar market.    Dear Parents and People: There is only one way to extricate  Burma from all these crises. That is, the Defense Services has  to stop continuing its previous mistakes and find a solution by  holding discussions with the democratic force led by Daw Aung  San Suu Kyi and the national ethnic forces. This is the only  answer. If the Defense Services continue to meet with only whom  it wants to meet and do what it wants to do, then the national  interests, including the interests of the Defense Services, will  be affected.    Dear parents and people: Up to this date, the SLORC has  ignored the wishes of the people and the 1990 election results.  It is a disgrace for the SLORC to say to the international  community that the election was free and fair at first, and then  to say later that a firm constitution is needed after the NLD  [National League for Democracy] led by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi won  the landslide victory. We strongly believe that the political  power must originate with the people. Due to the changes in the  world and the political changes in Burma, there is no doubt that  people will get the democracy which they are yearning for.    Not along ago, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi mentioned that we cannot  say all the problems will be resolved on their own once  democracy is achieved, but when democracy is achieved all people  will have the right to contribute their utmost in the  development of the country. We all must understand this. Help  one another. Especially, people have to be aware of SLORC's  attempt to drive a wedge between the people and the Defense  Services, among the people, and among the students. Continue to  struggle with your unwearied diligence.    Dear parents and people: I extend my best wishes for your  health and prosperity.</p>

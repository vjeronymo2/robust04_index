			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RAMONA PAGEANT: 'A LABOR OF LOVE';  </P> <P> THE ENDURING ROMANCE ABOUT OLD CALIFORNIA STILL TUGS AT THE HEARTSTRINGS OF  ACTORS AND AUDIENCES  </P> <P> "I am going to write a novel, in which will be set forth some Indians'  experiences in a way to move people's hearts," vowed novelist Helen Hunt  Jackson in 1883.  </P> <P> The result was "Ramona," a romance of Old California, about the love of a noble  Indian and a beautiful Mission girl. Published in 1884, Jackson's novel is  still tugging hearts. And so is Hemet's 66-year-old "Ramona Pageant."  </P> <P> With a cast of more than 350 people, the "Ramona Pageant" uses an entire  mountainside as its stage and is attended by 39,000 annually.  </P> <P> The 62nd edition begins its six-week run Saturday.  </P> <P> Although it's a large-scale event in terms of audiences, it is a family affair  backstage, with many of the same participants returning year after year. Cast  and crew members come from among the 85,000 residents of the Hemet-San Jacinto  Valley, which includes areas where many incidents in the Ramona story actually  took place. The stage, a 6,662-seat natural amphitheater called the Ramona  Bowl, is built in the unspoiled foothills of San Jacinto Mountain -- two miles  south of Hemet's main street.  </P> <P> Of the numerous actors, stage hands and makeup people who return to the Ramona  Bowl each year, many compare the coming of pageant time to a homecoming -- a  homecoming lovingly led by the play's co-directors, Maurice and Hilda Jara.  </P> <P> "Whenever we have the tryouts, it's like a reunion," said Tom Morlan, who plays  cowboy Jim Farrar, and has been involved with the pageant for 17 years.  </P> <P> Those involved refer to the nonprofit pageant as "a labor of love," and say it  is that sense of love and family that keeps them coming back year after year.  </P> <P> Longtime pageant associates include the Jaras, who have been involved with the  pageant for 36 years; 27-year stage manager Melba Gilmore, who has been a part  of the production for 43 years, and her husband, Watson Gilmore, who has played  the crusty Juan Canito for more than 20 years, and Elmer Grohs, who plays a  sheepshearer and has been with the play for 61 years.  </P> <P> "When we get together it's like old home week," said Hilda Jara. "There's a  real spirit of family -- I think that's why (the pageant) has lasted so long."  </P> <P>  -- --  </P> <P> The pageant is administered through the Ramona Pageant Assn., a corporation  that was formed through the Hemet and San Jacinto chambers of commerce after  Garnet Holme, the writer and first director of the Ramona Pageant, left the  rights of the play to the two communities in 1929.  </P> <P> With an annual budget of $300,000, only the two leading players, the directors  and the pageant's office staff are paid, somewhat meagerly, for their efforts.  But many give up their weekends from mid-January through performance time for  the play's rehearsals. An additional 500 behind-the-scenes volunteers work  during show times.  </P> <P> And there's no shortage of cast members, despite the long rehearsal hours and  lack of remuneration. Maurice Jara said about 25 people try out every year for  each of the leads, and in this year's auditions, eight women vied for the  supporting role of Margarita.  </P> <P> The current Ramona, Kathi Anderson, also played the coveted role -- as Kathi  Sommers -- in 1985. Anderson said that winning back the part was worth enduring  four years of the tough audition process.  </P> <P> "I kept trying," said Anderson, 36, who added that not being a part of the  pageant made her feel "like I'd gotten divorced. (Playing Ramona) is like being  back home again," Anderson said.  </P> <P> Anderson's co-star, Christ Thomas, is playing Ramona's husband, Alessandro, for  the third time. (He also played the role in 1985 and 1986.) Like Anderson, he  kept auditioning until he won back his role.  </P> <P> "But I was still involved (in secondary roles)," said Thomas, 28, who played a  sheepshearer at 16 and has been in the play ever since.  </P> <P> And for both leads, the play takes on an added sense of family: Anderson's  daughter Kristie, 10, and Thomas' daughter Anne, 8, were both selected for  roles in this year's production.  </P> <P> As for the Jaras, the pageant combines elements of their heritage (Maurice has  Hispanic ancestry and Hilda is a fifth generation Californian) with their love  of the stage. After working with the pageant for so many years (Maurice played  Alessandro for 15 years before becoming the director in 1969), it has become a  major part of their lives.  </P> <P> "We finally hit upon a vehicle that takes in all that we want to do with  something that we understand (Southern California's customs and lore)," Maurice  Jara said. "This is my biggest enjoyment in life. I stay for . . . the love of  doing it."  </P> <P> "(The pageant) has been my life," agreed Hilda Jara, who relayed the story of  the couple's involvement with the play.  </P> <P> "Maurice tried out for Alessandro and he fell in love with the play from then  on," she said. "I'd watch it when he was Alessandro and think, 'Gee, I'd do  this,' or 'I'd like it this way.' Then the director quit and we started  (directing the play) ourselves."  </P> <P> The "Ramona" story has a long history: four American and one Mexican film  versions have been made (including a 1910 version directed by D.W. Griffith and  staring Mary Pickford as Ramona), and at least 10 stage versions have been  produced.  </P> <P> The Hemet pageant's version (which has had 25 different Ramonas -- including  Raquel Welch and Anne Archer) debuted in 1923 and has been produced all but  five years (when war and recession intervened) since then.  </P> <P> "We have a beautiful setting and we use it," said Hilda Jara of the 160-acre  Ramona Bowl site. "We have action (including posses of horsemen dashing in and  out of scenes) on the hill, and all around. Most plays with similar settings  use only the foreground. It's an awesome thing when people appear from way up  on the hill and are a part of it."  </P> <P>  "The Ramona Pageant" will be performed Saturday and next Sunday April 22-23,  April 29 and 30 and May 6 and 7. All shows are at 3 p.m. and tickets are $12  and $15 (tickets for children under 12 are half-price in the $12 section).  Parking is free. Information: (714) 658-3111.  </P></p>

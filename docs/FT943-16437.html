			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / Mexico's anti-trust law put to test: Ted Bardacke finds a pragmatic approach on enforcement of competition Mr Santiago Levy is the man charged with enforcing Mexico's year-old anti-trust law, in an economy dominated by large companies, which use their strength to limit competition, but which need to be strong to fight off foreign competitors. Mr Levy has approached the task with delicacy, attacking monopolistic practices, but leaving the monopolies intact. 'People in Mexico generally confuse bigness with monopoly ..but we're neutral with respect to size,' he says. 'If you say that because of economies of scale you need to be big to compete in the world market, I say fine, just make sure you don't use that power to fix prices or write contracts that are anti-competitive. Our law is behaviour-oriented. 'We're also looking at the structural characteristics of the market,' he adds. 'There are some markets where even if you are very large and produce something that is traded on the world market without tariffs, the chances of exercising any kind of market power are small. Our concern is to make sure that regardless of size, and regardless of the number of companies in a particular market, they all avoid monopolistic practices.' To bear this out, the Federal Competition Commission last week announced a series of moves, which included: Fining five financial institutions around Dollars 600,000 (Pounds 390,000) for manipulating government securities auctions between October and November of last year. This co-ordination, which involved two of the market's biggest operators, Banamex and Operadora de Bolsa Serfin, generated an artificial discount. Prising open the system by which the state-owned oil giant, Pemex, awards petrol station franchises. In the past, Pemex awarded these franchises on a discretionary basis, limiting the number of petrol stations and raising the possibility of corruption and favouritism. Pemex will now have to award franchises and deliver petrol to anyone who meets municipal land use and federal environmental regulations. Forcing the country's main credit card operators to end the practice of setting unitary interest rates for their customers and a flat-rate commission for all retail outlets. Retailers will now be able to negotiate individual contracts in an effort to cut commissions which, at their current 5 per cent level, are about double those charged in the US. Retailers will also be able to offer cash discounts. Fining the national associations of dry cleaners and launderers for price fixing. Objecting to a proposed merger between copper wire maker Condumex, owned by principal Telmex shareholder Mr Carlos Slim, and one of its competitors, Conductores Latincasa, which would have created a company controlling almost 70 per cent of the copper wire market and dominated raw material purchasing. Each of these cases seems to have been strategically chosen to set some form of precedent. Fining financial groups for insider trading established the right of the commission to undertake its own independent investigations of financial transactions. Similarly, taking on Pemex upheld the jurisdiction of the commission over the non-strategic areas of state-sanctioned monopolies. The price-fixing cases against credit card operators and launderers confirmed the consumer advocacy orientation of the commission. And finally, standing up to Mr Slim, possibly Mexico's most powerful businessman, is a sign that the commission will not play favourites.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Companies dominating key sectors  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Company                Sector         1992 Sales                                       (Dollarsm)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Vitro                  Glass               3,303 Aeromexico/Mexicana    Aviation            2,140 Cemex                  Cement              2,210 Modelo                 Beer                1,476 Bimbo                  Bread               1,456 Televisa               Television          1,355 Industria Minera       Copper                936 Maseca                 Corn Flour            867 DINA                   Heavy Trucks          782 TMM                    Shipping              466  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: America Economia  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

'Arafat said in an arrival statement that he will brief  President Husni Mubarak on the results of his meeting with  Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres in Oslo.    'Arafat emphasized the importance of persistence to reach an  agreement with Israel for the meticulous implementation of the  Declaration of Principles, which was signed in Washington on 13  September.    He said that there are many obstacles that have prevented  the  implementation of the agreement until now. We expect the  Palestinian-Israeli talks to continue to overcome the obstacles,  he added.

			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Sun Alliance to axe 800 jobs in cost cuts SUN ALLIANCE, the UK's biggest insurer, yesterday announced plans to cut 800 jobs as part of a rationalisation programme designed to reduce costs and restore profitability. Most of the job losses will result from voluntary redundancies and early retirements over the year, although there are to be some compulsory job losses. Thirty-nine smaller branch outlets that are no longer considered cost-effective will close, with the company concentrating sales and customer service in 50 main branches. As with other UK composites, Sun Alliance has made heavy losses during the past two years as a result of tight rate competition, the recession and weather-related claims. Pre-tax losses for 1991 might amount to more than Pounds 450m. Mr Charles Coyne, analyst with Credit Lyonnais Laing, believes the move may be followed by other composite (life and general) insurers. 'There is an awful lot of fat to cut.' Sun Alliance's expense ratio - the yardstick that measures operating costs as a percentage of net premium income - amounted to 35.8 per cent in 1990, according to Department of Trade and Industry figures, nearly 2 percentage points above the average for the UK's top 10 composite companies. Last year, staffing was reduced from 14,200 to 13,800, with most losses concentrated at Sun Alliance (UK), which handles the group's personal lines of non-life insurance, such as household and private motor. That was largely the result of a decision to concentrate processing of a substantial part of the group's personal lines business at a new, inexpensive centre in Oldham, Lancashire. Komatsu, the Japanese earth-moving equipment manufacturer, yesterday announced a further 50 job losses at its plant in Birtley, Tyne and Wear, Chris Tighe writes. The company blamed the cuts on the construction industry's worst decline for more than 40 years. It hopes many jobs will be shed by natural wastage and voluntary severance, but compulsory redundancies are probable. The cuts will reduce the workforce at its sole excavator production outlet for Europe to 350. Mr Clive Morton, personnel director, said staff and suppliers had been assured that the future of the business was not at risk. Komatsu last year injected Pounds 10m in capital investment at Birtley, including design and test facilities for products tailored to the European market.</p>

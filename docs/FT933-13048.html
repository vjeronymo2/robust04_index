			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / Loan quality boosts Citicorp A SHARP drop in write-offs on property and commercial loans and a fall in loan-loss provisions fuelled a profits recovery at Citicorp, the US's largest banking group, in the second three months of the year. The group's results echoed the improvement in credit quality reported by other US banks in recent days, due to firmer property prices and the first clear signs that the patchy US economic recovery is feeding through to banks' customers. Record income from trading in the foreign exchange and securities markets also lifted Citicorp's after-tax profits, which reached Dollars 446m (Pounds 296m), up from Dollars 143m in the same period in 1992. Write-offs on property and commercial loans at the banking group fell to Dollars 297m, down from Dollars 380m in the first quarter and well below the peak of Dollars 792m in the last quarter of 1991. Lower losses on north American commercial property were behind the improvement: credit losses dropped from Dollars 527m in the second quarter of 1992 to Dollars 251m. Provisions for commercial and property loan losses made during the quarter were Dollars 273m, down from Dollars 583m a year before. Income from trading in financial markets soared to Dollars 572m, from Dollars 314m a year earlier, topping the quarterly record for a US bank set by JP Morgan only a week ago with Dollars 431m. Some Dollars 352m (up from Dollars 193m) came from foreign exchange. Leaving aside the lower credit charges and gains from trading, profits remained sluggish, contributing to a Dollars  1/4 decline in the group's share price to Dollars 31 3/4 by close. Mr John Reed, chairman, said revenue growth had been held back by 'troubled economies in the developed world', but that developing countries had grown strongly. Earnings per share in the second quarter reached 82 cents, up from 25 cents. For the first half net income was Dollars 1.1bn, or Dollars 2.06 a share, compared with Dollars 326m, or Dollars 0.61 a share, in the first six months of 1992, after an accounting change. The group's key tier one capital ratio rose to 5.7 per cent from 5.3 per cent at the end of March. US bank results, Page 24</p>

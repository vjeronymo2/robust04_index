			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ / DIRK SUTRO: SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT ;  </P> <P> CRAWFORD, MCGRIFF JAZZ UP THEIR CAREERS AS SOUL MATES  </P> <P> When David (Fathead) Newman had his horns stolen, Hank Crawford and Jimmy  McGriff became a team.  </P> <P> How did a horn theft lead to a new musical partnership? Saxman Crawford and  blues organist McGriff, who Wednesday opened a two-week stay at Elario's in La  Jolla, first played together in Greenwich Village at a benefit three years ago  to help Newman replace his instruments.  </P> <P> "They played a set that just took the roof off the place," remembers Maxine  Harvard, who manages both musicians. "Being the promoter/P.R. type I am, I  said, 'I can't let this go.' " Harvard booked them together at the Apollo  Theatre, and the duo clicked again.  </P> <P> Both musicians record for Fantasy/Milestone, and, soon after the Apollo date,  Ralph Kaffel, the company's president, asked them to do an album together.  </P> <P> "Soul Survivors" was released in 1987. Since then, the pair have done two more  albums, with the latest, "On the Blue Side," scheduled for January release.  </P> <P> McGriff's swinging work on Hammond B-3 organ provides the perfect foil for  Crawford's funk/blues sax. Crawford might not want to hear it, but McGriff  lends the music a bluesy fire lacking on some of Crawford's solo projects.  </P> <P> Though both men are blues players at heart, they also have substantial  background in jazz.  </P> <P> "I can go either way," Crawford said. "Most people classify me as R&amp;B or  blues, but I cut my roots on be-bop, straight-ahead. I'm more comfortable with  an R&amp;B, blues sound. My approach to horn is actually vocal, a singing,  melodic sound."  </P> <P> As a youngster, Crawford sang and played piano in church. One of his first jobs  was backing Ray Charles. He took up alto sax in high school, listening to  Charlie Parker, Louis Jordan, Earl Bostic and Johnny Hodges.  </P> <P> Crawford left Charles to record several albums of his own in the '60s, and  spent the '70s having his sound uncomfortably molded to fit the light, fusion  mold then in vogue at the CTI label. In 1983, he moved to Milestone and  returned to his grittier style, and he has recorded regularly with a band  including Newman and Dr. John since then.  </P> <P> McGriff grew up listening to jazz players such as Archie Shepp and Reggie  Workman, who lived in his Philadelphia neighborhood. He started on drums, vibes  and piano, but, when he switched to organ, Jimmy Smith, Richard (Groove) Holmes  and Milt Buckner became important influences. His first hit was an arrangement  of Charles' "I've Got a Woman," which reached No. 5 on Billboard's R&amp;B  chart in 1962.  </P> <P> Both Crawford and McGriff have independent careers and spend about half their  time playing or recording with each other.  </P> <P> At Elario's, Crawford and McGriff will be backed by drummer John Guerin and  guitarist Bob Devos.  </P> <P> Last week, the swan song sounded for jazz at Diego's Loft in Pacific Beach.  This week, it's more like "Happy Days are Hear Again."  </P> <P> Local jazz aficionado and occasional promoter Bob Geib reports that some local  musicians have reduced their fees to keep the club alive. This Friday night,  Geib has lined up saxophonists Rod Cradit and Gary Lefebvre, followed by the  spicy Latin jazz sounds of Algo Caliente Saturday night.  </P> <P> Sunday afternoon in the larger disco room behind Diego's restaurant,  clarinetist Bobby Gordon and trumpeter John Best work out with their quartet  from 2 to 4:30, with special guest Mike Wofford on piano.  </P> <P> The cost for all shows is $5. Those who have a Diego's Loft VIP card get in for  half price Fridays and Saturdays. Leave your name and address at the door, and  they will mail you one.  </P> <P> Geib expects jazz to continue at the club for the foreseeable future, but with  more emphasis on local acts than the nationally known performers featured  before the owners temporarily shut down to curb their losses.  </P> <P> KPBS-TV (Channel 15) kicks off a new season of "Club Date" jazz programs Friday  night at 10:30, with a show featuring Hank Crawford and Jimmy McGriff. It airs  again Sunday at 2:30 p.m.  </P> <P> KPBS is getting a jump on its national sisters. Most public television stations  will begin airing the new group of six shows next spring or summer.  </P> <P> Heading into its second year, the show is gaining a following and improving in  technical quality, according to producer Paul Marshall.  </P> <P> Last year, more than 100 public television stations across the country aired  "Club Date." For 1989, there are six new programs featuring guitarist Joe Pass,  trumpeter Harry (Sweets) Edison, Crawford and McGriff, singers Mose Allison and  Jimmy Witherspoon, and flugelhorn player Art Farmer with saxophonist Clifford  Jordan.  </P> <P> Sound for this season's shows was recorded on an eight-track machine, so the  instrumental mix could be polished after the live studio session. Programs are  broadcast in stereo.  </P> <P> Elario's continues as the show's co-sponsor, with the club's Steve Satkowski  serving as associate producer. Marshall said each show costs more than $10,000  to produce; he would like to find a corporate sponsor to pay for programs  featuring such jazz legends as Ella Fitzgerald and Dizzy Gillespie.  </P> <P> RIFFS: A clip from a "Club Date" featuring Jimmy Witherspoon may be used when  the blues singer appears on CBS News's "Night Watch" program tonight. . . .  Randy Porter, the talented local pianist, is working Monday nights at Elario's  through December. . . . The San Diego Jazz Orchestra, led by alto saxophonist  Gary Scott, plays the KSDS-FM (88.3) "Jazz Live" series Tuesday at 8 p.m. in  the city college theater. You can attend, or listen to the live radio  broadcast. . . . Guitarist Hank Easton and his Easton West Band are featured  Mondays through November at Humphrey's on Shelter Island.  </P></p>

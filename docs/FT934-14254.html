			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Tactics for smooth touchdown: Boeing's efforts to ride out the downturn in the new aircraft market The problems facing Boeing, the world's largest manufacturer of airliners, are as big as its jumbo jets. Although the company celebrated a landmark last week by delivering to Singapore Airlines the 1,000th 747 jumbo to be built, so far this year it has failed to win a single order for this, the biggest and most profitable aircraft in its product range. Mr Philip Condit, Boeing's president, says there are some 'faint positive signs' in the market, but he does not expect any swift, sustained recovery in new aircraft orders. 'I'm not holding my breath,' he adds. The situation at Boeing's 1,000-acre facility at Everett, outside Seattle, the world's largest manufacturing plant, illustrates the company's predicament. Boeing has spent Dollars 2bn in the past two years expanding its plant to start producing the 777, its new wide-bodied airliner. This has increased production capacity at the plant - which already employs about 27,000 people and also assembles the 747 and 767 - from 14 to 21 aircraft a month. At best, next year Everett will be turning out only nine of these wide-bodied aircraft models a month. The recession and financial turmoil in the airline industry have forced Boeing to cut production rates for its entire family of airliners - including the narrow-bodied 737 and 757, built at Renton, Seattle - from a peak of 39 1/2 aircraft a month to 21 in the past 18 months. The dearth of orders means production of the 747 alone has fallen from seven aircraft a month to four a month and will drop to three in January. It could fall still further, and the company will probably have to shut one of its two 747 assembly lines next year. At Everett alone, there are some Dollars 4bn worth of stocks. 'It's a hell of an investment if you are not using it,' says another Boeing executive. The company's problems have increased as a result of growing competition from the European Airbus consortium. Boeing has responded by developing new products to compete against the European group in one of the deepest cyclical downturns in the industry's history. Apart from the 777, which challenges the Airbus A330 and A340, Boeing is planning a new family of 737 airliners to defend its position against the A320 in the 150-seater airliner market. It is also developing a cargo version of the 767. This has pushed up research and development spending to about Dollars 1.7bn this year, while new aircraft deliveries to customers have fallen from 446 last year to about 350 this year, and will fall further, perhaps to about 258, next year. But Mr Condit, a 52-year-old engineer who joined Boeing 28 years ago and worked his way up the ladder, becoming president last year, says he has seen it all before. 'We were down to 1 1/2 747s a month in the mid-1970s and down to two a month in the mid-1980s, when we could have built up to seven a month,' he says. Boeing, says Mr Condit - widely tipped to take over eventually from Mr Frank Shrontz, Boeing's chairman - is also responding to market pressures by radically changing the way it does business. 'What we are doing is the re-engineering of Boeing,' he says. In the past, Boeing was an engineering-led company with technology driving its product strategy. Today, the company wants to be a market-driven company with customer requirements dictating product strategy. 'We are now adopting a very strong customer focus to provide our customers with value for money and speed in the way we respond to their needs,' Mr Condit says, adding that in the competitive aviation business 'the race goes to the one who keeps running'. At all costs, Mr Condit wants to avoid the mistakes of the big US car manufacturers. 'The US car companies spent a lot of time watching each other and forgot to watch the customer. The result was to let the Japanese come in and change the character of the US car industry,' he says, implying Boeing will not make the same error with its European competitor. Mr Condit's model is General Electric, the US conglomerate which has become a growing force in the commercial aerospace business after its rescue of GPA, the troubled Irish aircraft leasing company. 'GE has done well in recognising they needed to focus on customers, value and speed of reaction,' says Mr Condit, who visited GE in August with other senior Boeing executives. The clearest sign of restructuring at Boeing is the depth of job cuts the company has made to adapt employment to lower production levels. From a peak of 148,672 employees in November 1989, the workforce is expected to fall to about 116,000 by the end of this year. But the company has managed to mitigate some of the shock of the restructuring programme by slowing down its reduction of the huge backlog of firm aircraft orders, which totalled Dollars 80.8bn at the end of June. 'In the current cycle we did not increase our production rate as fast as we did two decades ago. In the 1970s we worked off our backlog too fast, and when the market stopped we fell off a cliff,' Mr Condit explains. The drive to hold down costs and improve productivity has enabled Boeing to maintain operating profit margins on commercial aircraft programmes despite a reduction in output. The company, which has seen aircraft leasing and financial support to customers increase sharply in the current downturn, believes its restructuring efforts will help it exploit the next growth cycle. Operating profit margins have improved in Boeing's defence and space business, which accounts for about 20 per cent of group sales. A few years ago, Boeing considered moving out of the defence business, but Mr Condit now sees good potential for the company in this sector. With few indications of any short-term recovery in the commercial aircraft market, Boeing, Airbus and McDonnell Douglas are chasing the last big airliner order in the current cycle: for up to 60 aircraft worth about Dollars 6bn from Saudia, the Saudi Arabian carrier. Competition for the deal has led to a revival in the trade dispute between the US and Europe over government subsidies for Airbus. But Mr Condit plays down the issue, insisting 'trade wars are not beneficial to either side'. He confirms Boeing is 'really interested' in working with the four Airbus partners - Aerospatiale of France, Deutsche Aerospace, British Aerospace and Casa of Spain - on a new 600-800 seater super-jumbo. But, while evaluating the market for what it calls a Very Large Capacity Aircraft (VLCA) with the European companies, Boeing has, alone, been considering a stretched derivative of the 747: it will be about 20 per cent longer with two decks running the full length of the fuselage. Mr Condit does not expect either programme to be launched before the next century. Overcapacity in the airline market continues: about 1,000 new aircraft lie idle in the Californian desert; the 747 and the new 777 already provide aircraft with 400 seats or more; and a version of the 747 used on some Japanese routes can carry 550 passengers. The last thing Boeing wants is another costly development programme when orders are falling and it is already having to spend heavily on other aircraft projects. But the company is determined to defend its 60 per cent share of the world airliner market and its monopoly in the jumbo sector. The aerospace industry does not expect a rebound in commercial aircraft ordering until 1995 or even 1996. Mr Condit says he is not interested in forecasts but in getting his strategy right: 'We will be focusing more than ever on our customers' requirements, and we don't want to be left behind to allow someone else in.'</p>

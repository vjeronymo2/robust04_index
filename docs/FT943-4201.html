			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Worries over profit margins hit share prices - Market report The UK stock market suffered a heavy setback yesterday morning after a batch of company results drew attention to pressures on profit margins among British companies. Share prices managed a partial rally later when sterling and British government bonds improved behind an unexpected improvement in the June trade figures as well as a stronger US dollar. The FT-SE 100-share Index lost the 3,200 mark at the opening as share prices were marked down in the face of a heavy list of company trading statements. The sharpest blow came from BTR, the UK conglomerate which not only turned in disappointing first-half profits but alarmed the broad range of the market by disclosing that margins were being pressured by rising raw material prices and difficulties in passing on these costs to customers. Within one hour of the official opening, the Footsie was down by nearly 40 points, and BTR stock was severely hit on turnover already exceeding previous daily volumes for the year. By the end of the day, BTR had lost nearly 12 per cent. The market was also hurt by unsettling trading reports from several other blue chips, including Cadbury-Schweppes, Glaxo, Sun Alliance and British Gas, although the last named pleased investors by maintaining the dividend payout. The FT-SE 100 Index bottomed out for the day at 3,166.2 and rallied to close at 3,180 for a fall on the day of 23.9 points. Market strategists calculated that the drop in BTR shares was responsible for around 9.7 points of the day's loss on the Footsie. BTR's references to pricing difficulties, which hit hard across the manufacturing stock centres, were echoed in the latest distributive trades survey from the Confederation of British Industry. Other dull spots included Glaxo, which spelled out its losses in bond markets. Cadbury Schweppes drew attention to competitive pressures in its consumer markets. Traders reported a wave of switching out of the manufacturing stocks, which are now seen as vulnerable to a squeeze between cost inflation pressures and customer resistance to high prices. Investors appeared to be moving back towards the market's 'safe havens', notably the utility sectors which have shown high dividend promise as well as good growth prospects. Significant US selling originated in the stock index futures market and gathered pace following optimistic comments on US inflation policies from the vice-chairman of the Federal Reserve. Wall Street was 16 Dow points ahead at the London close. Although the weight fell on the blue chip sectors, which reacted to a Footsie stock index future trading at a discount throughout the session, sellers also appeared among the second line issues. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index closed 17.3 down at 3,761.8. Trading volume, boosted by heavy turnover in BTR and Glaxo, increased yesterday to 668.5m shares, with the contribution from non-Footsie stocks reduced to around 53 per cent. On Wednesday, retail business was worth Pounds 1.38bn, continuing the pattern on this week's stock market activity which has seen share trading volumes remaining high as the Footsie has lost ground. At last night's closing reading, the stock market had fallen by nearly 2 per cent over the past three trading sessions. Nervousness over upward pressures on domestic interest rates, which focused on this week's policy meeting between the UK chancellor of the exchequer and the Governor of the Bank of England, remained in place yesterday in spite of the unexpected dip in the UK June trade deficit. This had little direct effect on equities, which made no response until stering improved towards the close of the trading session.</p>

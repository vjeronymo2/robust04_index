			<p><P> July 31, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Tortilla vendors, defying strict government price controls, raised the price on  the staple by 45% in Mexico City, the government newspaper El Nacional said.  The paper said its reporters encountered indignation among homemakers during a  tour of tortilla factories over the weekend. The official price of tortillas is  275 pesos a kilo, or about 6 cents a pound. But over the weekend, tortillas  were selling for 400 pesos a kilo in most shops, or about 8 cents a pound, the  paper said. The price increase came in defiance of a nationwide pact on wage  and price controls that was put in place after inflation hit a record 159% in  1987.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Changes at the Border"] </F>   [Text] Following Brest Oblast, a border zone has also been  established on the Belarusian-Polish border in Grodno Oblast.  The oblast executive committee has approved a list of village,  settlement, and hamlet soviets, which crisscross the border  zone. The Border Troops have vacated plots of land located  within 800 meters of the state border to their engineering  facilities, including land on which barriers and other  facilities were previously located.    The oblast executive committee has also established a border  zone ranging from between 200 and 500 meters along the  Lithuanian border, including plots of land on which checkpoints  have been erected. These regulations have been introduced  according to the Belarusian Cabinet of Ministers resolution "On  Measures for Implementing the Belarusian Republic Legislation on  the State Border of the Republic of Belarus." Rayon executive  committees and commanders of military units have been requested  to explain these measures to the general population.</p>

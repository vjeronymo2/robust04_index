			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Balladur downplays meeting with Kohl PRIME MINISTER Edouard Balladur yesterday downplayed expectations of any new monetary initiative arising out of his first meeting with Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Bonn tomorrow. The new law to make the Bank of France independent, which will go before the parliament next month for approval, will be 'an element of reinforced confidence' between France and Germany because their central banks will have the same status and 'speak the same language,' Mr Balladur told a press conference. 'But I will not be asking the Germans' to lower their interest rates, said Mr Balladur. It was for the Bundesbank to respond to its own domestic pressure for cheaper money. The Bank of France this week cut its official lending rates to their lowest level since autumn 1989, exploiting the current strength of the franc and the recent drop in French money market rates. Once the Bank of France gets autonomy in monetary policy-making, the government in Paris will have just as little influence over domestic interest rates as the government in Bonn, Mr Balladur noted. Mr Balladur dismissed as a 'pious wish' any idea of 'accelerating the timetable for monetary union'. The sorry state of the public finances of most European governments would not permit any speedier move towards currency union, he said. His goal was for France to meet the Maastricht convergence criteria by 1997. Referring to his planned May 4 visit to see British Prime Minister John Major, Mr Balladur said 'Franco-British issues were less urgent, at least on the monetary front'. But in the context of the stalled Gatt trade talks - where his difference of opinion with Britain is sharpest - the French premier said he had ordered from his staff a rapid review of whether Europe really was more protectionist than North America, the Far East and other regions.</p>

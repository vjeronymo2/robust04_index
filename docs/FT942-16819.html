			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Engineering and food boost output Higher output from the engineering industries and a rise in food production were the main influences behind the sharp rise in manufacturing output between January and February. The 0.6 per cent month-on-month increase meant that for the second month of the year, manufacturing output remained well above the levels recorded in the second half of last year. In the three months to February it rose 0.8 per cent, and was 2 per cent up on the same three months a year ago. In the three months to February, output of the engineering and allied industries - which has the highest weighting within manufacturing - rose a seasonally-adjusted 1.6 per cent to stand 1.8 per cent up on the same three months a year ago. A particularly strong sugar harvest pushed food, drink and tobacco production up a seasonally adjusted 0.4 per cent in the latest three months compared with the previous three-month period, although it was down 0.2 per cent on the same period a year ago. Most of the other manufacturing sectors also increased their production levels. Output of wood and wood products - boosted by higher furniture production - grew by 5 per cent compared with the previous three-month period, while output of electrical equipment picked up 2.8 per cent. This mainly reflected strong growth in production of computers but also of telephones and related equipment, and domestic electrical goods. The most notable falls were 2.9 per cent in the coke, mineral, oil-refining and nuclear fuels industries; 2.2 per cent in the output of non-metallic mineral products, covering products related to the construction industry; and 1.8 per cent in the output of basic metals and metal products. Oil and gas production surpassed its previous 1987 peak, increasing by 8.2 per cent on the previous three months. Compared with the same three months a year ago it was 29.9 per cent higher. Coal production, by contrast, continued to decline, dropping 14.9 per cent in the three months to February compared with the previous three months, a reflection of the new lower-volume contracts negotiated between British Coal and the electricity generators. Analysts were encouraged by the strong growth of investment goods. An increase of 1.8 per cent in the three months to February on the previous three months, compares with growth of 0.6 per cent for consumer goods and 0.1 per cent for intermediate goods. Mr Ian Shepherdson, economist at Midland Global Markets, said the rise in investment goods output was 'evidence that the recovery is shifting in favour of industry, which is vital if consumer spending slows in the face of tax rises'. The Central Statistical Office said there had been a number of small downward revisions to the latest figures. The manufacturing output index in December was revised down to 95.6 from 95.7, while the January figure was revised to 96.6 from 96.8. The surge in North Sea oil and gas production which has helped underpin industrial output lifted total UK primary fuel production in the three months to February by 9.4 per cent, the Department of Trade and Industry said, Robert Corzine writes. Oil production in the period was 30.5m tonnes, up 25.8 per cent compared with the same time last year. Natural gas output increased by 14.6 per cent, while coal production was down by 28.7 per cent. The oil and gas rises reflect the large number of new fields which came on stream last year.</p>

			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: DELUCA FAILS TO REGAIN FLYWEIGHT TITLE  </P> <P> San Diego's Tony "Bazooka" DeLuca failed in his attempt to regain the North  American Boxing Federation flyweight championship Wednesday night at the Sports  Arena by losing a unanimous 12-round decision to Blythe's Ysaias Zamudio.  </P> <P> The defeat is DeLuca's third in a row and lowers his professional record to  17-5-3.  </P> <P> Zamudio (21-3), ranked No. 1 by the World Boxing Assn., dominated the fight  throughout and never gave DeLuca an opportunity to land any effective blows.  </P> <P> Zamudio was the much quicker fighter and he cut DeLuca's right eye in the 11th  round.  </P> <P> "He was a little fast," DeLuca said. "I think he was quicker than (Michael)  Carbajal and he was a little more unorthodox than Carbajal."  </P> <P> Asked if he will continue fighting, DeLuca said: "I've got boxing in my blood.  I'd have to be talked into giving it up by my trainers." DAVE MCKIBBEN  </P></p>

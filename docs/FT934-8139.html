			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Papers continue to lose sales WITH OFFICIAL newspaper circulation figures showing a pattern of continued decline, the consultancy group Henley Centre warned yesterday that the imposition of value added tax on newspapers and magazines could have a 'devastating' impact. In the six months from May to October total sales of national dailies fell by 1.69 per cent to just over 14m while the Sundays fell by 2.65 per cent to 15.8m. Only three daily newspapers - The Sun, The Times and Today - increased sales in the period. The biggest loser was The Independent, which fell by 10.95 per cent to 333,647. Apart from Sunday Sport, which fell by 17.2 per cent, the worst loser of the Sundays was The Independent on Sunday, which fell by 8 per cent to 368,246. Only The Sunday Times and the Sunday Telegraph showed gains. The Henley Centre argues that because newspaper circulations are already in long-term decline 'VAT could send national newspapers into an inescapable downward spiral'. It believes the average price of dailies would rise from 30p to 34p and the price of Sundays would rise from 62p to 70p. It says VAT at 17.5 per cent would lead to a 6 per cent circulation loss for national dailies and 12 per cent for Sunday titles. 'This is an overnight loss equivalent to that experienced by the industry over the 1989-1992 recession,' says Henley, which based its forecasts on econometric modelling work. Henley believes publishers are likely to try to absorb some of the increased costs but the effects would still be considerable. It forecasts a spiral of declining circulations, higher prices and falling quality. The relationship between price rises and circulation decreases has in the past tended to show that a price rise of 10 per cent reduces sales by 6 per cent. The Treasury has estimated that VAT at 17.5 per cent on national newspapers would yield Pounds 375m a year. Henley says this would be less than Pounds 250m because of price absorption. The centre asks: 'Would the political fallout of VAT on national newspapers be worth it for 0.5 per cent contribution to a public sector borrowing requirement of Pounds 50bn?'</p>

The two infected Cypriots are both 32 years old and the  third  is 20. All of them contacted the virus from sexual intercourse  with an AIDS carrier most likely outside Cyprus, probably Greece  or Thailand, the announcement added.    Since October 1986, 163 people - 91 Cypriots and 72  foreigners - were infected by the deadly disease. Of the 91  Cypriots, 80 of them are men.    Seventy-seven of the total number of Cypriot carriers live  on  the island while 14 live abroad.    So far 16 Cypriots suffering from AIDS have died, while two  other carriers died from other causes.    The age group 20-29 concentrated 42 of the 91 Cypriots  carrying AIDS. The second high-risk group is between 30 and 39  which concentrated 29 cases.    The most common way (76 percent) of contacting the disease  is  through sexual intercourse, the announcement said.</p>

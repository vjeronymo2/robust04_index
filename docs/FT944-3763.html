			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Revenue seeks views on tax changes for bond repo market The Inland Revenue has published a discussion paper outlining possible tax changes which could facilitate the establishment of an open sale-and-repurchase market for UK government bonds. It intends to establish whether tax changes are necessary to ensure the efficient functioning of a 'repo' market for government bonds and, if so, how they should be best made. The possibility of setting up the market was announced in the Budget last month. The Revenue consultation runs in parallel with wider consultation by the Bank of England concerning the market structure and regu-latory aspects of an open repo system. Both are requesting comments from market participants by January 31 1995. A bond repo is an agreement for sale and repurchase of a bond at a pre-arranged price. When an interest payment falls due, it is usually received by the repo buyer rather than the security's seller. To compensate the seller for the 'real' coupon which he has not received, the buyer pays him what is called a 'manufactured' pay-ment. Under present law, manufactured gilt interest payments are net of tax. But while most investors receive their real gilt coupons net of withholding tax, some are exempt and receive gross interest payments. These include pension funds and charities, or foreign residents holding gilts, which are free of tax for residents abroad. If a repo market were introduced without accompanying tax changes, this would throw up complications. Some investors who repo gilts across a coupon payment date would get manufactured interest payments net of tax, even though they usually receive gross payments. One option proposed by the Revenue is to allow manufactured interest payments to be paid gross. Another option is to allow gross payment of real and manufactured gilt interest payments. The main drawback of this, however, is a cashflow loss to the Exchequer because the tax on the interest is collected as part of the general tax liability of recipients some time after it is received. To limit the cost to the Exchequer from a move to gross interest payment, the Revenue offers four possible options: restricting gross payment to certain gilts; restricting gross payment to certain categories of gilt holder; introducing a system of quarterly accounting to collect tax on the gross interest received before it would normally be assessed; or making a charge on those who choose to receive gross interest payments.

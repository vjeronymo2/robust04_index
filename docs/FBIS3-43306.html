			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Communique issued by the General Staff of the National </F> Union for the Total Independence of Angola Armed Forces in  Huambo on 3 January]    [Text] [Words indistinct] General Staff of the National  Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] Armed Forces  categorically denies having launched an attack on Malongo in  Cabinda.    2. If the Front for the Liberation of the Cabinda Enclave  leadership does not claim responsibility for the attack, once  more we see a manipulation of the Popular Movement for the  Liberation of Angola [MPLA] itself, which on the eve of the  arrival of U.S. congressmen in Angola, intends to create facts.  In this way on 11 December 1993 it attempted the life of the  UNITA president. Those who do not know the MPLA and prop it up,  will reap a tempest. MPLA is a liar.    3. The UNITA leadership is committed to finding viable and  definitive solutions for the Angolan conflict through talks  which are scheduled to resume in Lusaka on 5 January.    [Issued] Huambo, Angola, 3 January, Cabinet of the Chief of  General Staff.    [Signed] Director, Brigadier (Elidio Paulo Sachiambo).</p>

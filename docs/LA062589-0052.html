			<p><P> June 25, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A SMALL TROPHY FROM HER AFRICAN TOUR;  </P> <P> BETWEEN TWO RAINS BY HARRIET HEYMAN (ATHENEUM: $19.95; 282 PP.)  </P> <P> A reader should always expect something fresh and original from a new novel,  and, when we're promised a trip to Africa, expectations rise. Of course, Africa  has been too much explored in past years for most people not to be familiar  with the terrain: an abundance of beauty and space existing in uneasy  juxtaposition to poverty, hunger and brutality. We have seen how the old  colonial ways have been rediscovered by new tribes of expatriates bringing  their cinematic dreams of Africa with them, only to succumb to the white man's  tedious distractions of adultery and alcohol. Inevitably, they depart the  continent with a standard repertoire of horror stories: corrupt bureaucrats,  gratuitous military violence, the carnage of elephants for ivory. Even those  who travel no further than the local mall will have come across at least some  of these tales.  </P> <P> So, picking up Harriet Heyman's first novel, "Between the Rains," one hopes for  a fresh intelligence that will throw a good strong light on a unique continent.  Sadly, we are disappointed. There are no new insights in "Between the Rains,"  and I think the author knows it. In a letter home to her boyfriend, the heroine  perfectly expresses Heyman's own inadequacy: "She could describe the speed of  the cats but not the thrill of tracking them. She could describe the killing,  but not how it felt that she and Max were the only human witnesses to it."  </P> <P> The book opens with a young woman, Mirie Keane, leaving Manhattan. She takes  off for East Africa clutching a bag of photographer's equipment and some  romantic notions about photographing an elephant giving birth -- an act never  captured before on film. With a commission to take shots of a safari ranch, she  meets the usual round- up of old Africa hands and expatriates and has a few  exciting moments in the bush with wild animals. One of her photographs -- a  gory shot of a fatal buffalo attack -- brings her notoriety and enables her to  stay on in Africa. She shakes off the dust of her past and engages in an  unconvincing romance with a character who has not previously given her the time  of day.  </P> <P> The book limps along as Mirie, photographs safe in her bag, sets off for the  capital, only to run into military barricades. Soldiers ransack her belongings  and toss her film onto rose bushes strewn with the corpses of looters killed by  the army. Finally, reaching the airport, crowded with people making a hasty  exodus, the plane rumbles down the runway and we catch a last look at our  adventurer, who is giggling nervously in her seat.  </P> <P> Journeys should be as spiritual as they are physical. In leaving behind the  habits and attitudes of our everyday lives, we can be freed by the different  rhythms of another culture and experience something unexpected and exotic --  both in the land and within ourselves. Herein lies one of the main problems of  "Between the Rains." The writer too quickly connects with the disdain and  cynicism that is so much a part of the white experience in Africa. She sees  Africa as the expatriates do, and this accounts for the jaded and superficial  quality of the book. It is written without the benefit of imagination and  remains untroubled by intelligence. One tags along for the ride, but is not the  better for it.  </P> <P> The wonder of an elephant birth -- and this is the entire purpose of this  African sojourn -- is described with astonishing banality. The birthing pains  of a new nation, though given scant attention, are handled with the same  careless indifference.  </P> <P> "Between the Rains" seems to go to some lengths never to outreach itself, and,  because of this, Heyman has managed to bring back only a very small trophy from  her African adventure.  </P></p>

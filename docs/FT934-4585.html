			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Chile 'bored by democracy': Indifference to coming national elections After only four years of it, Chileans appear to be taking democracy for granted. With presidential and parliamentary elections due this month, 47 per cent of the electorate declare themselves either 'indifferent to' or 'bored with' politics, according to the results of a nationwide poll. If responses such as 'no confidence' or 'don't know' are added, the percentage of those disgruntled with politics reaches 75. Furthermore, the Centre for the Study of Contemporary Reality, which organised the poll, predicts that 10 per cent of registered voters (who are obliged by law to vote) will spoil their ballot papers. 'If this trend continues,' says Mrs Marta Lagos, director of Cerc, 'it would mean a significant change in our political culture, which formerly displayed a strong tendency towards participation in all types of electoral activity.' Such indifference is difficult to fathom in a nation denied access to democratic institutions for 17 years of military rule. Some commentators argue that democratic habits take time to be re-learned, while others believe that General Augusto Pinochet's most important legacy has been the 'de-politicisation' of a once polemical nation. The elections of December 11 - which should result three months later in the first handover from one democratic government to another since Salvador Allende became president in 1970 - are hardly designed to animate a bored populace. The result - a victory for Mr Eduardo Frei, candidate of the governing Concertacion coalition - has been a foregone conclusion for months, given the relative popularity of the current administration and ideological disarray on the right. All recent polls give Mr Frei about 60 per cent of the vote against less than 20 per cent for his nearest rival, Mr Arturo Alessandri, candidate of the right-wing Union for Chilean Progress. The remaining four presidential candidates score about 10 per cent between them, with another 10 per cent undecided. Mrs Lagos believes that the polls falsely inflate the Concertacion vote at the expense of support for Mr Alessandri whom she expects to poll 26-30 per cent on December 11. However, she is certain Mr Frei will do enough to avoid run-off elections in February. He needs to win more than 50 per cent. Mrs Lagos also believes there will be few changes in the make-up of congress. As things stand, the Concertacion has 58 per cent of deputies and 48 per cent of senators. This has proved enough to govern, but not to push through controversial legislation or to amend Gen Pinochet's 1980 constitution, which awards disproportionate power to the right-wing opposition. Dramatic shifts in allegiance are unlikely given the absence of stirring issues. In 1989 Chileans chose between politicians who had aligned themselves with the military regime and those who had led the campaign for a return to democracy. By contrast, in this year's campaign it is difficult to distinguish among the views of mainstream candidates. All of them support continuation of the neo-liberal economic model and express the same concerns over perceived social ills. For the most part, the issues that do provoke electoral interest - such as poverty, poor housing, unemployment and crises in the health and education systems - are those where the right is considered weakest. Part of the electorate may be disgruntled with the Concertacion's performance in these areas but, other than vote for the extreme left, it feels it has little alternative but to support the status quo. The one area in which the right is considered more competent is that of battling crime. According to Cerc findings, a quarter of the population believes that the spread of delinquency is the nation's biggest problem, although concrete evidence suggests crime may actually be falling. Nevertheless, Mr Alessandri is campaigning hard on the issue, suggesting that Concertacion policies have led to a breakdown of law and order. Of the alternative candidates, the ideas of environmentalist Mr Manfred Max-Neef appear to have struck the loudest chord. Although Mr Max-Neef, who derides what he sees as Chile's blind pursuit of economic growth, is polling only about 3 per cent, Cerc believes he could attract 5 per cent of the final vote. The other three candidates are Father Eugenio Pizarro, representing the communist-led Mida coalition, Mr Cristian Reitze, candidate of a green-humanist coalition, and Mr Jose Pinera, a former minister of Gen Pinochet and independent right-wing candidate. Such diversity of opinions is unlikely to have much effect on the outcome, especially since the constitution is designed to reward coalitions and punish small parties. Furthermore, Chile's recent turbulent history seems not to have affected basic political allegiances which divide the population into roughly equal blocks of left, centre and right. If the result of the poll is in little doubt, one thing remains shrouded in mystery. With less than 30 days to go before elections, it is still not clear how long Chile's next president will serve. Various attempts to cut the presidential term from its current eight years have foundered on the rocks of party bickering. Mr Frei has said that, if elected, he would ask congress to reduce the period to four years. But, he warned, if parliament could not agree to do so by March 1994, when the new administration takes over, he felt disposed to serve out his full eight years. There is certain to be public pressure for congress to put aside its differences and cut the presidential term. For an electorate already bored with its politicians, the prospect of having the same president for eight years is not a thrilling one.</p>

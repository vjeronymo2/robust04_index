			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with PLO Executive Committee Chairman Yasir </F> 'Arafat by unidentified correspondent in Moscow on 19 April;  'Arafat speaks in English throughout with superimposed Russian  translation -- recorded]    [Text] [Correspondent] Mr. Chairman, what are the results  of your conversations with the Russian leaders?    ['Arafat] I am glad that I have had constructive and  fruitful  meetings and conversations with his excellency, President  Yeltsin, and Mr. Kozyrev, with the interior minister, and the  Duma speaker. After this, a fruitful and warm meeting took place  with his Holiness, Patriarch Aleksiy II.    In all of these meetings, particularly with President  Yeltsin, we spoke frankly about the situation we are faced with  and on how to give renewed impetus to the peace process. We  also spoke about the obstacles that have sprung up and how to  overcome them with Russia's help. For your country is one of  the co-chairmen of the Madrid conference. You and the United  States are its co-sponsors, and, as you know, Mr. Kozyrev, along  with Mr. Christopher, appended his signature to the agreement  between the Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel. The  United States and Russia have a political and moral  responsibility.    For our part we are completely satisfied with the assurances  that we have received from President Yeltsin. For he informed  us that he is fully involved in the peace process in the region  and is striving to achieve a real and universal peace there,  particularly between the Palestinians and Israelis.    [Correspondent] However, by 13 April peace had not been  established. The agreements that have been signed are not being  fulfilled. What do you think about the situation? What are the  conditions for the renewal of the negotiating process?    ['Arafat] Unfortunately, I am forced to say that the  fulfillment of the fall Washington accords have been thwarted  and postponed because of the Israelis' maneuvers. You must  remember what the prime ministers stressed about dates and  borders. Here are the results: 13 December passed by, 13 April  passed by. No specific results have been achieved, on the spot.  We do not have the results that could have moved the whole  peace process forward. We are in a real impasse. We are trying  now -- talks on this matter have taken place in Cairo and Paris,  we have tried to find solutions in order to overcome such  obstacles.    For my part, I cannot give any assurances, no guarantees,  because everything depends on the Israelis. Their authorities  are wasting time for no purpose. They are trying to avoid  fulfilling what was already agreed in Washington, agreed  honestly, precisely, clearly, and in writing. Why, in my view,  are there such delays? Everyone ought to know about this.  Because the American administration gave to Israel -- it even  sold peace earlier even than before the fulfillment of the  Washington agreements. It supplied Israel with more armaments  and the most up-to-date combat equipment; $10 billion of loans  and credits; a huge powerful computer. It would seem that  Israel obtained everything it wanted even before the  implementation of the agreement. But we Palestinians paid for  this, paid the price of peace, before the fulfillment of  commitments by the other side. But we do not have this peace.  Look, we still do not have our own state territory. One side  has obtained everything, and the other -- the Palestinian -- has  paid for this. As you can see, the delay in the deadline for  the implementation of the agreement has given the chance to  extremists from both sides. They have started to organize  themselves and to act against peace. This is the result and  this is how we have turned out.    I have to say, unfortunately, that the peace process has  lost  its credibility. Faith in it has been lost since this breakdown  over the time-scale of the implementation of the accord.    [Correspondent] Mr. President, I recall your speech in  Strasbourg at the Council of Europe to the parliamentarians of  32 countries. You spoke about a ruined economy and  infrastructure. How do you hope to reconstruct and rebuild it,  to renew it, and to give it a new boost?    ['Arafat] But here I should disappoint the Russian people:  Our infrastructure has been completely destroyed as a  consequence of the Israeli occupation. As I have mentioned  during my meetings with the EC ministers -- and I met them too,  I said to them: Some of you occupied the Latin American,  African, Asian countries and conquered their peoples at some  time in the past. You were leaving behind states with ready  infrastructure: Railway stations, radio, ports, airports,  roads, clinics. But the Israelis have destroyed everything  themselves and we, the Palestinians, have to begin from scratch.  What sort of future do we face? It can either be something  resembling the tragedy of Somalia -- the people in the Gaza  strip are already threatened by hunger -- or we can grow into  one of the economic tigers -- such as Singapore, for example. We  have the necessary conditions and talents for this. As you  know, the percentage of educated people among the Palestinians  is the highest in the Middle East. Even higher than in Israel.  But we need help from friends and brothers, as well as help and  assistance from the international community. This is one of the  issues I discussed here in Moscow. We have also discussed  questions of economic relations.    [Correspondent] You are the first Arab leader visiting the  new Russia. Pointing to this, I should like to note that there  is great potential and many unused possibilities that still  exist in our bilateral Russian-Palestinian relations as well as  in Russian-Arab relations as a whole. How do you see the  prospects for economic, cultural, and scientific relations?    ['Arafat] This is not the only thing that links us. In the  first place we are neighbors. That is extremely important. I  am sure that by ensuring the coordination at all levels, which  we really need, we can achieve a lot. I hope that we can  achieve coordination on all of these problems, not only in  politics but also in economics, education, and the development  of agriculture.    I would particularly like to speak about an important sphere  of Russian-Palestinian cooperation that I discussed with  President Yeltsin and His Holiness Aleksiy II -- about Russia's  links with Jerusalem, about spiritual and religious links.  These are the centuries-old links between the Orthodox Church  and the holy places. I think that they will acquire a second  wind. In short, we are in favor of cooperation in all spheres  and by all means.    [Correspondent] Many thanks for your answers.</p>

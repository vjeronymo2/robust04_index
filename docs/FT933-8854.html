			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / Accounts panel acts on criticism THE FINANCIAL Reporting Review Panel, the accounts watchdog, is considering providing more information on the reasons behind its rulings. The initiative is one of several changes being considered as part of its first procedural overhaul since it began operations two years ago. The move follows representations from the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales calling for greater information on the review panel's decisions. It marks a greater openness about the reasons for its judgments on companies, which are given in public announcements. Some accountants have criticised the verdicts of the review panel, and have said it was difficult to assess the judgments without knowledge of how they were reached. The issue was highlighted in a decision this week by the institute after it had investigated the panel's criticism last year of Trafalgar House, the construction, property, shipping and hotels group. Trafalgar House was forced to amend its 1991 accounts after criticism from the panel of its decision to charge a Pounds 102.7m deficit on a revaluation of properties directly to reserves. The institute ruled that there was no case to answer against any of its members. It is believed that the institute was provided with no information on the reasons behind the review panel's verdict, with which Trafalgar House complied after an initial refusal. Other changes to the panel's procedures being considered include ways to simplify and speed up administration of cases, and greater opportunities to clarify facts before cases are formally undertaken. The changes are likely to debated and introduced over the next two to three months.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "ett": "Vienna Fixes EU Positions"] </F>   [Text] Vienna -- At a "government summit" on 19 January,  Austria's negotiation positions on the three major remaining  problems -- agriculture, transit traffic, and real estate  transactions -- were fixed for the negotiations on European  Union [EU] membership. Officials subsequently told DIE PRESSE  that consensus was achieved.    For agriculture, a "mixed system" is envisaged, containing  elements of a single market concept and a concept involving  transition periods. This is considered a defensible compromise  variant.    There is also agreement on the settlement of transit  traffic.  Austria intends to accept the "environment-friendly" EC demand  that bilateral transit traffic, which was originally not  considered for the ecological point system, will now be taken  into account. Austria now also intends to get a mixed model for  the real estate issue (second home) accepted in the membership  negotiations.  <H5>  Regulation of Regional Planning </H5>   Specifically, this mixed model is a combination consisting  of  a regional planning regulation (including the ban of second  homes through the dedication of land) and a regulation of real  estate transactions (so that dedicated construction ground  cannot be used for second homes).    In an interview with DIE PRESSE, foreign policy spokesman  Andreas Khol of the Austrian People's Party [OeVP] said he  assumes that "another great breakthrough" will be achieved at  the EC Council of Ministers' meetings on 6 and 7 February. Then  only "a few hard nuts" would still have to be cracked.    In addition to Chancellor Franz Vranitzky, Vice Chancellor  Erhard Busek, Foreign Minister Alois Mock, and State Secretary  Brigitte Ederer, Ministers Fischer, Lacina, Klima, and Weiss  also took part in the detailed two-hour discussion on European  Union.    In an interview with DIE PRESSE, Chancellor Vranitzky said  regarding the EU time schedule that the government believes  there is a "good" chance of completing the membership  negotiations by March. Austria was trying to keep to this goal,  said Vranitzky. Regarding the touchy problems that were still  open, it would not have been necessary to agree on a common  language: "We know anyway what we want."    In any case, the chancellor said in the interview,  government  contacts with EU member states would now be increased at the  bilateral level. He will go to Athens on 26 January, because  Greece is currently holding the presidency. Mock will be more  active at the foreign ministers' level, said Vranitzky.    President Thomas Klestil said in a NEWS interview that a  delay in the EU negotiations would be "regrettable, but not a  tragedy." He said he believed, however, a referendum in June  and a conclusion of the negotiations with the EU in March would  be possible. He said, prior to the referendum, he would make  his position very clear and would "comment very clearly on the  pros and cons of the European Union."    The EU membership negotiations were also the focus of a  statement made by Foreign Minister Alois Mock (OeVP) in  parliament on 19 January. He said, if both sides really wanted  it, the EU negotiations could be concluded by March. Austria  would make "every effort" to achieve this. Mock: "It is a  chance we are trying to take. We will see whether we will be  successful." However, the government would in any case be  guided by the principle that the negotiation result is important.    According to the foreign minister, the most difficult  problems are related to agriculture, transit traffic, and second  homes. But he was optimistic that they would be solved. Mock  also made clear, however, that in the agricultural area, the  financing problem could not be borne by Austria alone.  Regarding real estate transactions, it was indispensable to  protect housing requirements for the local people by  restrictions in connection with the acquisition of second homes.  <H5>  Mock Praises NATO Proposal </H5>   The foreign minister also dealt with the Partnership for  Peace concept offered by NATO to all CSCE members. He said that  this initiative, which implied a possibility for countries to  make use of it in an individual way, was of particularly great  importance for the Central and East European countries that are  currently in a security policy vacuum. Since the stability of  these countries is extremely relevant to Austria, Partnership  for Peace would also have a favorable and important impact on  Austria, said Mock. Austria welcomed this initiative, but was  seeking security in integration within the EU, which also  implied its "docking with the Western European Union."</p>

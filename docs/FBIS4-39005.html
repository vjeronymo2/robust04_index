			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Igor Petrov report under the rubric "Decision in </F> Preparation": "Government Intends To Index Link Minimum Wage"]    [Text] It seems that the many debates about the need, on  the one hand, to combat inflation by restricting the growth in  the money supply and, on the other, to prevent a social  explosion will end soon.    As your ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI correspondent has learned from  reliable sources, documents providing for an increase in the  minimum wage in the country have already been placed on the desk  of Government Chairman Viktor Chernomyrdin. According to the  Labor Ministry's proposals adjusted to take into account the  opinion of the Finance Ministry and the Federation of  Independent Trade Unions, it is proposed to index the minimum  wage by a factor of 1.4 as of 1 July. Thus it will rise from  14,620 rubles [R] to R20,500. The same factor will be applied  to the calculation of wages in the budget-funded sectors of the  economy. Category One of the Single Wages Schedule, which  determines wages in all budget-funded organizations, will rise  from R16,000 to R22,400. This is the figure which will form the  basis for setting the wages of workers in the public sector.    The Labor Ministry's proposals finally reflect the  differentiated approach to the formation of the incomes of  various categories of workers. In practice, this should mean  extra financial increments that will be paid to workers in the  first four categories of the Single Wages Schedule. Total pay  in, for example, Category One will be no less than the minimum  pension plus all the extras [nakrutki], and this will amount to  R39,000. This will be the actual rate for a worker in Category  One of the Single Wages Schedule.    This is surely the first time in the short history of pay  indexation that these proposals have been given the full support  of the Finance Ministry. Furthermore, the financial experts  have given an assurance that if this indexation is implemented  as of 1 July, as planned, the money required for that purpose  will be allocated from the budget in full and in that month.</p>

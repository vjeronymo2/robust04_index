			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / First no-strike ambulance deal Nearly 200 employees of Northumbria Ambulance Service have accepted a local pay offer conditional on a no-strike agreement - the first among ambulance staff in the UK - and an end to collective bargaining. The offer, made on an individual basis to the 199 station officers and paramedics, gives them rises of 4.8 per cent and 4.1 per cent respectively from July 1. The agreement means pay negotiations will no longer be conducted through the Association of Professional Ambulance Personnel, which was the association's sole recognised union.</p>

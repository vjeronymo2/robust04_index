			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with ANPP President Ricardo Alarcon de </F> Quesada in London by reporter Francisca Paquita Calvo Zapata at  the Radio Havana Cuba studios in Havana; date not given --  recorded]    [Text] [Calvo] Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada, president of the  National Assembly of the People's Government [ANPP], is in  London having been invited by the British representatives of the  Parliamentary Union. Radio Havana Cuba would like to ask  Ricardo Alarcon his general impressions of the visit of a Cuban  assemblymen's delegation to Great Britain.    [Alarcon] This visit has to be seen, first, within the  framework of a specific reality. The British Parliament invites  only two foreign delegations each year. This year, they decided  to ask us to visit the UK. We accepted and discussed a date  mutually convenient to the two countries, which was at this  time. It allowed me to make this visit following the special  session of the ANPP in early May, and here we are.    But I must point out that it is significant, in my judgment,  that this country's parliament considered Cuba to be one of only  two delegations to be invited this year. I have been here a  little over two days, and we have not had a break. We have had  meetings with the speaker, that is, with the president of the  Parliament's House of Commons, who, together with the president  of the House of Lords, invited me. We met with two parliamentary  commissions today and with a group of British businessmen.  Tomorrow we will have two more meetings with this country's  businessmen and with the British Government's Caribbean Trade  Advisory Commission. We also met today with the secretary of  state, who is in charge of the Latin American and Caribbean area.    I would say it has been, or rather continues to be -- I  still  have various meetings tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, and  then we shall end the visit -- a very intense, very useful stay  during which many contacts were made and discussions held with  many people on a level of great respect and cordiality. I think  our British friends are capable of showing their guests much  hospitality, and a certain degree of frankness, flexibility, and  understanding, which is truly admirable.    [Calvo] How will this visit benefit the relationship between  Cuba and Great Britain, and the European countries, in general?    [Alarcon] To tell you the truth, here we have been  concentrating on Great Britain, which is a European country that  has a lot of influence. Its conduct, its inclination, tends to  attract followers from other European countries. I can tell you  that it is clear that in the next few months there will be a  follow-up on actions that were slowly taken this year, which I  am sure will result in more British activity in Cuba. We await  -- and that was decided in today's conversations -- the visit of  Great Britain's secretary of state for trade in September. The  UK, Great Britain, has traditionally been linked to the  Caribbean area. Remember that a large part of the Caribbean,  from Jamaica to the Caribbean's eastern limits, was colonized by  England, had a special link with the UK, is part of the  Commonwealth, etc. The British have more knowledge of and more  presence in the area. Based on that, they have a more  reasonable, realistic policy, and a better understanding of the  Cuban reality and the international reality that has allowed  them, through frank dialogue with Cuban authorities, to slowly  build a relationship that grows more cordial and natural every  day.</p>

"The ruling is illegal and valueless," Duran-Ballen stated  while announcing that the new price structure, in effect since  29 January, "will not be revised."    The ruling of the Constitutional Court, which is controlled  by the opposition parties, would have been implemented  immediately, halting price increases on several fuels announced  by the government to compensate for fiscal revenue losses  brought about by the fall of international crude oil prices.    Today, however, prices remain at the same levels as before  "because there is no reason to alter them," as explained by  Interior Minister Marcelo Santos. The minister accused the  opposition of "cheap maneuvers" by requesting a declaration of  unconstitutionality against the price increase because the  opposition claims it was done by creating new taxes, an  attribute that does not correspond to the government but is  limited to only Congress.    The government's challenge came about as a result of the  Constitutional Court's irregular structure. The mandate of its  members, which was scheduled to end December 1992, was extended.  Under this configuration, the court did not obtain the mandatory  five votes that would have suspended the price increase.    On Friday, National Congress President Samuel Belletini,  "representing the government," unexpectedly swore-in a lawyer as  the new court magistrate. This same lawyer had been appointed by  former President Rodrigo Borja but had never assumed his  responsibilities because at that time he did not have the  required minimum age.    The current administration, which came to office in 1992,  did  not appoint its representative to the court because it was  waiting for a complete reorganization, which was scheduled to  take place in December 1992.    In a swift court decision taken last night (local time), the  new court magistrate provided the necessary fifth vote allowing  the fuel increase to be declared unconstitutional.    The fuel price increase caused two weeks of violent street  protests, especially in Quito. In addition, a workers strike and  an Indian mobilization were also declared. New protest marches  against the fuel increase have already been announced for this  coming Wednesday, after the long carnival holidays. Following  the court's decision and the government's challenge, we foresee  that the opposition parties, which control the Ecuadoran  Congress, will react harshly to these events.</p>

			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / International Company News: Bombardier sets up aircraft sales unit BOMBARDIER, the Canadian transport equipment maker, is creating a single business unit to sell its new Canadair Regional Jet and the de Havilland Dash 8 commuter aircraft. The combined marketing effort arises from Bombardier's purchase earlier this year of a controlling interest in Toronto-based de Havilland, which was previously owned by Boeing, the US aircraft maker. Bombardier also owns Short Brothers of Belfast, and the US business jet maker, Learjet. The 50-seat Regional Jet (RJ), an expanded version of the Canadair Challenger, is due to enter service next month with Lufthansa's CityLine. Bombardier currently has 36 orders and the same number of options for the RJ, more than half from Comair, a US regional airline. De Havilland has delivered 329 Dash 8 aircraft and the company has orders for another 54. Combining sales and customer support services will enable Bombardier to reduce costs and to offer customers a wider variety of products in the highly-competitive commuter aircraft market. Bombardier said Boeing exercised an option with Bombardier worth CDollars 70m (USDollars 58.8m) for the continued manufacture of Boeing 767 rear fuselage sections by Bombardier's Canadair unit, Reuter reports. This option allowed Canadair to continue deliveries until the first quarter of 1996. Canadair has manufactured the 31 ft rear fuselage section since 1979.</p>

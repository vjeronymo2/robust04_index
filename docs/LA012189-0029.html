			<p><P> January 21, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOCKEY VIOLENCE COLUMN IS GIVEN POOR MARKS  </P> <P> Scott Ostler's misguided voyage through hockey violence and the mind of Marty  McSorley leaves innocent readers ill-informed and hockey fans irate.  </P> <P> First off, hockey violence is a result of poor rules and inconsistent  officiating. As Wayne Gretzky states, the rule should be, if you fight, you  leave the game.  </P> <P> Second, violence is only promoted by the media. That's a fact, we get more  pictures and clips of fights than good goals.  </P> <P> Last, Ostler missed the point in his article. He interviewed McSorley, who  stated that he "does not like to fight," yet Ostler turned Marty's words around  and glamorized it.  </P> <P> JONATHAN MILLER  </P> <P> Reseda  </P></p>

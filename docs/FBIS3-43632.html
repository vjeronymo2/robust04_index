			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sources in the General Staff of the Armed Forces for  the Liberation of Angola yesterday firmly rejected the  possibility of South African mercenaries being present in its  ranks. The sources described as false and completely unfounded  the claim made by the new Popular Movement for the Liberation of  Angola [MPLA] ambassador to Namibia regarding South African  extreme right-wing elements. The sources said the claim is an  MPLA ploy aimed at diverting attention from the mercenaries the  Futungo de Belas government has been recruiting through the  (Executive Altcom) company. We have been informed that  mercenaries recruited by the MPLA in Namibia and South Africa  are in Cabo Ledo.</p>

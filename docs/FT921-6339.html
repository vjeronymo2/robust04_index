			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Iraq 'hiding nuclear secrets' Iraq continued to withhold information from UN inspectors about its weapons of mass destruction and nuclear capability, contrary to assurances of co-operation, the head of the United Nations team reported yesterday, writes Michael Littlejohns, UN Correspondent, in New York. Mr Rolf Ekeus, chairman of the commission charged with dismantling Iraq's most dangerous armaments, said that prohibited, previously undeclared ballistic missile materials were discovered by the UN at two sites even as discussions were taking place with Iraqi officials in Baghdad last weekend.</p>

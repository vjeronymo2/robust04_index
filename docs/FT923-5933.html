			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Panel concerned about Trimoco's Hartwell claim The Takeover Panel yesterday showed some concern over a point made by Trimoco, the motor trader, in its defence against a Pounds 25.9m hostile bid from Hartwell. Mr Roger Smith, Trimoco's chairman, recounted in the defence document how two Hartwell executives had been invited on to Trimoco's board early this year on the basis that Hartwell's parent, the Saudi Arabian Jameel group, would reduce its stake in the company, which then stood at 23.5 per cent. The Jameel stake has since been increased to 39.4 per cent, with the help of loan stock conversion. The Panel yesterday raised questions about Trimoco's suggestion that the bidder had gone back on an agreement and the way this had been reported in newspaper articles. Mr John Wei, chairman and chief executive of Hartwell and one of the two who spent a few months on Trimoco's board, has denied that there was any such agreement. It is understood that Hartwell has spoken to the Panel about statements made in Trimoco's defence.</p>

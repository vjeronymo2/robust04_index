			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Italy's Corruption Scandal: Foreign competitors may win the ultimate kickback - Scandal threatens to count against Italian companies seeking public sector deals at home and abroad BUSINESS as usual is the motto at most Italian companies, whether the minority tainted by arrests and allegations of paying kickbacks or the vast majority so far unaffected. However, the unwinding scandal has not gone unnoticed by Italy's exporters or the thousands of foreign companies operating subsidiaries in the country. Leading exporters largely brush off the effects of the scandal on their businesses, describing the affair as being limited to domestic public-sector contracts. However, there are already signs that their foreign competitors may be trying to turn matters to their advantage. So far, there have been no examples of big contracts being lost. However, with other European markets in recession and competition in many of the industrial sectors in which Italians specialise growing ever more cut-throat, it may not be long before an important deal slips through a company's fingers because of the impact of the scandal. Some state-owned companies may already be feeling the impact. Italstrade, the big civil engineering arm of the Iri state holding company, believes it may have lost its chances of winning a tunneling contract for London Underground's Jubilee line extension because of financial problems at its parent and adverse publicity. The company, which is part of IRI's loss-making Iritecna building and general contracting subsidiary, has already signed a letter of intent to build a tunnel under the Thames for a section of the new line. But hopes to construct a further part from London Bridge Station appear to be receding after requests for more information and guarantees about the position of the parent company. Mr Eberhard von Koerber, the deputy chairman of the multinational ABB engineering group, who is also responsible at board level for the Italian market, has had ample reason to get to know the Italian market. ABB is believed to be interested in both the big state-owned engineering groups on the privatisation list - Nuovo Pignone, the turbines and compressors subsidiary of the Eni energy and chemicals concern and Breda Costruzioni Ferroviarie, the railway equipment group owned by the Efim state holding company, now in voluntary liquidation. Mr Von Koerber was blunt: '. . . The Italian managers with whom I met to discuss (privatisation) are either in jail, disappear at night, or have been fired. That would be inconceivable in Germany.' Last week, Mr Franco Ciatti, Nuovo Pignone's chairman, was arrested on allegations linked to the corruption scandal. So far, the investigations have not touched BCF. But ABB itself has been caught up in the net. Earlier this year, Mr Umberto di Capua, head of its big Italian subsidiary, was arrested and briefly detained in San Vittore prison on allegations of kickbacks linked to orders for Milan's new third metro line. The allegations followed the interrogation last year of Mr Ivo Braglia, another ABB executive. 'We all knew that in Italy, things tended to be done differently than in other countries,' said Mr Von Koerber. 'But if there's a strong state role in the economy and legislation which is not very clear on financing parties, it's possible to arrive at the sort of situation which is now being dismantled.' Italian exporters have had a strong reputation for innovation, technical expertise and a strong commercial sense. Of late their competitive edge has been sharpened by the devaluation of the lira against most major currencies. But with stiff competition in the markets, few should be surprised if their foreign competitors start benefiting as the domestic corruption scandal rumbles on.</p>

			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / World Trade News: CoCom offer to east Europe THE 17 member governments of the Co-ordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (CoCom), the Paris-based organisation vetting militarily useful exports, yesterday offered to share sensitive technology with their former Soviet and east European enemies, if the latter tighten their own controls, writes David Buchan in Paris. The offer came at the first meeting of the CoCom Co-operative Forum, which brought together 42 countries, including Japan and Nato's CoCom members, along with nine republics from the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). The US, which claimed the initiative for establishing CoCom, announced Dollars 11m (Pounds 7.2m) to help former Warsaw Pact states or territories set up controls capable of monitoring exports from the bigger number of current suppliers.</p>

			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMENTS ON CUBA  </P> <P> John Horn's cover story on tourism in Cuba ("The Other Caribbean," June 24) was  remarkably fair and free of cold-war mentality.  </P> <P> Cuba's pristine beaches and paucity of Coca-Cola signs, and the like, sound  inviting.  </P> <P> Alas, though Cuba welcomes tourists from the United States, our government  prohibits ordinary tourists from visiting there. I thought it was Communist  countries that restricted the travel of their citizens to capitalist countries  to prevent them from learning what capitalism is really like. It seems we need  our own glasnost here in the U.S.A.  </P> <P> CLIFFORD OLIN  </P> <P> Alhambra  </P></p>

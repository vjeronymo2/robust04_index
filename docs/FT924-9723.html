			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Arts: Meredith Monk - Music Theatre In the broad church of American minimalism, Meredith Monk is a distinctive and refreshingly unpretentious voice. While the music of many of her contemporaries has become grandiose and self-regarding, Monk has patiently and quietly cultivated her own furrow, crossing and recrossing the boundaries between music, dance and theatre, developing her pieces out of the simplest vocal ideas and the most painstaking preparation. In Houston last year Monk unveiled her most ambitious piece to date - the three-act opera Atlas, which Max Loppert welcomed warmly on this page. The performers brought together for that production are now touring Britain as the Meredith Monk Vocal Ensemble, offering an hour-long concert version of Atlas with the instrumental scoring boiled down to a pair of electronic keyboards and an assortment of arcane percussion. A concert performance of such a work, however witty and musically expert, is necessarily a second best. In Monk's world the symbiosis between sound and gesture is a totally intimate one; each depends on the other for meaning and context. A sequence of non-verbal numbers, beautifully patterned, attractively homespun, cannot sustain the dramatic weight it requires. The elegant vocalise (not unlike early Laurie Anderson, without all the electronic hardware) can be enjoyed in vacuo, but despite Monk's own introductions to the excerpts from each act, the sense of these numbers from Atlas building into something much more substantial was hard to imagine. The programme begins with a sample of a theatre piece from 1990, Facing North, Monk's celebration of the Canadian Arctic. It is a straightforward two-hander, and the four extracts given here by Monk herself and Robert Een suggested a delicate warm-hearted study, accumulating its patterns and tags from Inuit melodies and spicing them with a modicum of gesture; the folksy side of Monk is never far from the surface, yet it rarely cloys or becomes too cosy.

			<p><P> November 18, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VELASCO'S PASSING SPELLS VICTORY FOR TAFT, 21-20  </P> <P> Perhaps the man who stenciled Taft High quarterback Edwin Velasco's name on the  back of his football jersey had a stuttering problem. Or maybe an earthquake  hit in the middle.  </P> <P> Whatever the reason, it reads: VELALASCO, on both his home and away uniforms.  </P> <P> An additional syllable to be sure, but Velasco had a little something extra in  Friday night's West Valley League championship game at Pierce College, tossing  three touchdown passes as Taft defeated El Camino Real in a thriller, 21-20.  </P> <P> Velasco, a 5-foot-10 senior, completed five of nine passes for 103 yards. A  mediocre effort? Hardly. Velasco had thrown one scoring pass all season  entering the game, and that came last week.  </P> <P> "I guess I finally got it together," Velasco deadpanned.  </P> <P> For Taft (5-4, 4-3 in league play), it marked a fourth consecutive league  title. El Camino Real (4-5, 3-4) missed an opportunity for its first league  title since 1980.  </P> <P> And the Conquistadores missed by inches.  </P> <P> Velasco connected on a 27-yard scoring pass with Daryl (Happy) Cash in the  closing moments of the third quarter and Irving Carter scored on a two-point  conversion run to give Taft a 21-14 lead, but El Camino Real nearly stole it in  the final minutes.  </P> <P> Taking possession at its 33-yard line with 6:33 left, El Camino Real moved to  the Taft 10. A key play in the drive was quarterback Tony Bordwell's third-down  swing pass to Brian Astgen, who gained 15 yards and a first down. After the  whistle, the Conquistadores received another 15 yards for an unsportsmanlike  conduct call against Taft's Greg Bernard.  </P> <P> Two plays later, on second and eight from the 10, fullback Jamal Anderson  slammed through the middle and into the end zone to bring El Camino Real to  within a point with 3:04 left. The Conquistadores went for two and the outright  title, dusting off a double-option play.  </P> <P> Lining up with a two-back set, Bordwell ran left and pitched to Anderson, who  ran into Taft's Steve Lockridge, Alex Price and Darnell Hendrix at the goal  line. Anderson tried to dive over the top, but was stopped just short and  thrown backward.  </P> <P> "It was a power-option play," El Camino Real co-Coach Mike Maio said. "He made  the right decision."  </P> <P> Anderson, who gained a game-high 134 yards in 21 carries and scored two  touchdowns, had the option to pitch the ball to the trailing tailback on the  play.  </P> <P> "We waited all year for a two-point conversion to run it," Maio said. "But he  did the right thing. Without him, we would never have gotten here."  </P> <P> Taft was the first team this season to defeat El Camino Real in a game where  Anderson gained more than 100 yards but it took Velasco's magic to do it.  </P></p>

			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Markets: At a glance - Fund launch fillip for smaller companies Glasgow Investment Managers this week made a vote of confidence in the smaller companies sector by launching the Shires Higher-Yielding Smaller Companies investment trust. It will buy shares in companies with a market capitalisation between Pounds 25m and Pounds 250m, with a minimum dividend yield of 120 per cent of the FT-All Share index. Its projected initial gross yield will be 7 per cent and the trust's managers expect dividends to grow faster than inflation. David Williams, managing director of GIM, said: 'We are confident we are at the bottom of the cycle and the current weakness of the market offers very real opportunities for growth over the longer term.' The market is certainly weak at present - the Hoare Govett smaller companies index dropped 1.22 per cent to 1134.17 over the seven days to Thursday July 16, while the County NatWest index fell 1.56 per cent to 901 over the same period.</p>

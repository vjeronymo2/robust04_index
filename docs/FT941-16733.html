			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / 11% rise in car sales surprises dealers The strength of recovery in the UK new-car market last year took dealers and manufacturers by surprise and has produced forecasts of further sales rises during 1994. Figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders yesterday showed new car registrations rose by 11.6 per cent in 1993, to 1,778,426 from 1,593,601 in the whole of 1992, despite a downward blip in December. However, last month's 7.73 per cent drop compared with the previous December was technical - the result of an artificial boost to registrations in 1992 caused by a rush to register remaining cars without catalytic converters before a December 31 deadline. Mr Ernie Thompson, the SMMT's new chief executive, yesterday welcomed the figures. He said: 'We expect a modest recovery to continue in 1994 for which we are currently predicting sales of around 1.86m.' The Retail Motor Industry Federation, representing the bulk of the UK's retail motor trade, is predicting a further increase of 100,000 sales - to 1.88m - this year. However it warned that last year's growth was partly the result of intense marketing activity which had done little for profitability. It fears that a similar situation will prevail this year as continental European manufacturers intensify their UK sales efforts to compensate for slumping demand in their domestic markets. Even if the forecasts are realised, sales will still be well short of the record of 2.3m, set in 1989. Statistics for the commercial vehicles sector, also released yesterday, reinforce the RMI's warning on marketing activity. Sales of vans, trucks and buses, bought strictly on the basis of business need, were much less buoyant. They finished the year down 2.05 per cent at 197,067, from 201,186. Ford retained its crown as market leader last year with 21.46 per cent, but its principal rival Vauxhall narrowed the gap at 17.09 per cent. In December, Ford's share of 17.16 per cent left it trailing not just behind Vauxhall's 17.47 per cent for the second time last year but also  - for the first time - behind Rover. Some of the biggest 'winners' last year were continental European manufacturers, some of whom outperformed Japanese rivals. Fiat, Renault and the Peugeot group, including Citroen, increased sales by around one-third. Peugeot, which took a record 8.02 per cent, has now increased its UK market share for the 10th year in succession. Imports' share of the market rose marginally to 55.51 per cent from 54.93.

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina  Network in Serbo-Croatian at 1400 GMT on 21 January carries in  its regular 26-minute newscast several reports on the fighting  in the Republic.    Reporting on the situation in Maglaj, Hajrudin Sermic says  that "over 800 shells have so far today landed on the civilian  targets and the defensive positions. Civilian casualties have  been reported. The fighters of the 201st Maglaj Brigade are  heroically defending the free territory. Heavy losses have been  inflicted on the united aggressor [the Serbs and the HVO], but  they do not seem to have had enough as their futile attacks are  still under way now."    Mirudin Aldobasic reports from the operational zone of the  7th South Operative Group that "since this morning the [Serb]  enemy on the Doboj front has been shelling Matuzici, Mravici,  Alibegovci, and (Maslinovac). (Omanjska), (Sivsa),  (Paradaglije), and Kalosevic on the Tesanj front have also come  under enemy artillery fire." The report says that "since this  morning the Mt. Ozren Chetniks from their well-known positions  have been shelling Lijesnica, (Mekolj), (Omezina), and (?Polje  Plane)."    In his report from Bihac, Mirza Sadikovic says that "it is  relatively quiet here today, but there has been some sporadic  small arms fire along the front line with the paraformations of  the so-called Kladusa autonomy." He cites the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army 5th Corps Command as saying that "it has  rejected outright the proposal by the other side on establishing  demarcation lines and some kind of buffer zones. That is  unacceptable for two reasons, the 5th Corps statement says.  First, this is an integral part of the territory of the  Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and second, no lines or buffer  zones can divide our people."    The studio announcer says that Sarajevo was "relatively  quiet  this morning."</p>

			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Survey of Paints and the Environment (6): The 'refinish' market at a crossroads - Environmental issues are the driving force behind vehicle refinishing paint technology / Producers of coatings for repairing the paintwork of cars and other vehicles were once slow to adopt new technology, but they are now making up for it For nearly 50 years from the mid-1930s, the UK crash repair market was dominated by cellulose paints. Nitro cellulose had been used to make explosives during the First World War. The development of cellulose spray paints on motor vehicle production lines helped mop up spare capacity. These spray paints deskilled traditional oil-based brush painting, were easy and forgiving to apply - and by the mid-1930s were widely available. They dried rapidly by solvent evaporation but because there was a high ratio of solvent to pigment, they needed a considerable number of coats to achieve an adequate paint film thickness. Other countries, however, developed their own refinish paint technology. In the US, acrylic lacquers were developed in the 1950s; in Germany, restrictions on the production of nitro cellulose led to alkyd-based technology, the forerunner of today's refinish coatings. The latter's disadvantage was that the paint took too long to dry. Overcoming this spurred the development of 'two-pack' paints in Germany. These used a chemical hardener mixed in with the paint, prior to use. The paint cured through a combination of chemical reaction and solvent evaporation, aided by gentle heating, making them suitable for use on both production lines and body shops. Also, because two-pack paints contained a higher proportion of pigment to solvent, fewer coats were needed to achieve the required paint film depth. In addition, unlike cellulose, rubbing down between coats was not required and a very high gloss finish was obtainable straight from the spraygun. Moreover, by adjusting the base material and hardener formulations, a variety of characteristics could be built in, such as resistance to extremes of temperature, colour integrity, solvent resistance, flexibility and smoothness of finish. Correctly applied, these paints were capable of fully matching, if not exceeding, the quality and durability of production line finishes. The drawbacks were that they needed the dust-free environment of a spraybooth and that they generally contained isocyanates, a respiratory sensitiser damaging to lungs, which made it necessary for painters to wear breathing apparatus. The new paints were also less forgiving to apply, requiring better quality spray-guns and better trained painters. The changeover from cellulose to two-pack paints was therefore slow in some national markets, but by the end of the 1980s, cellulose paints were becoming marginalised in bodyshops, largely through pressure from vehicle manufacturers who were insisting upon the use of approved two-pack paint systems if their anti-corrosion warranties were to remain in place after accident repairs. Until the mid-1980s there was very little awareness, or interest, in the environmental or health and safety implications of refinish paint applications, and consequently very little by way of legislation. The impact of green issues in politics has changed this. Environmental legislation is now the most significant force driving refinish paint technology with paint manufacturers' research and development aimed primarily at meeting ever more stringent legislation without compromising paint quality, durability or application efficiency. Initial UK legislation affecting vehicle refinishing was the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health regulations (COSHH) in 1988, followed more recently by the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations - the MHSWR. Both have put considerable pressure on vehicle manufacturers and refinishers to improve health and safety standards. These, together with the Environmental Protection Act - the EPA - which became law in 1990, have provided the UK with some of the most exacting anti-pollution legislation in the world. The purpose of the EPA is to reduce and eventually eliminate the use of VOCs  -volatile organic compounds used as solvents - in coatings. VOCs react under sunlight with nitrous oxides to create low level ozone  - photochemical air pollution which damages vegetation and can also cause breathing difficulties. VOC emissions as paint cures can be controlled either by increasing the ratio of solids to solvent or by replacing some, or all, of the solvent with a harmless pigment carrier such as water. Another approach is to improve spraybooth filtration systems to prevent VOCs being released into the atmosphere, as well as improving paint application systems so that more paint ends up on the vehicle rather than on the spraybooth floor. Paint companies are obliged by law now to provide products which meet the staged reduction of VOCs required by the EPA. At present, the law applies only to bodyshops buying more than two tonnes of VOCs annually, which have to have authorisation from their local authority to operate. The limit has proved too high to affect any but the largest bodyshops - and the control has been limited further by the Department of the Environment allowing bodyshops to offset solvent products returned for recycling against purchases when calculating the registration threshold. Those bodyshops having to meet the two tonne requirements of the EPA feel that they are at a competitive disadvantage and there is a strong groundswell of resentment that the main pollution culprits are smaller, ill-equipped bodyshops not covered by the Act. The EPA is, however, an enablement act which means that the DoE can reduce the present two tonne limit at any time. The industry is expecting reduction by the end of the year, possibly to one tonne, although the majority of industry observers are in favour of a much lower limit, a quarter of a tonne in some cases or even zero in others. In any event, the main elements of the VOC reduction objectives of the EPA have yet to implemented. These have already resulted in dramatic developments both in product technology and applications equipment. All the leading paint companies have introduced 'high solids' paint which will meet the first stage regulations coming into force in 1995, and certain companies such as ICI Autocolor, Glasurit, the BASF refinish business, and DuPont have already introduced water-based refinish paints in the UK designed to meet the more stringent requirements which will come into effect in 1998. Water-based paints are already widely used on vehicle production lines but can be more sensitive to temperature and humidity variations than their conventional solvent-based counterparts. There are probably only a few hundred UK bodyshops now using water-based refinish paints and many others see few, if any, commercial advantages in changing to water-based yet. ICI and Glasurit argue, however, that bodyshops using water-based systems now will be able to build up their experience of new technology well in advance of legislative requirements. Other paint companies take an opposing view, arguing that waterborne paints are more expensive, dry more slowly and are only available in limited colours. Some say future product developments may well enable the strict 1998 VOC levels to be met without a switch to water anyway. Paint manufacturers also have to watch what is happening in the car factories. There has been a dramatic increase in the use of 'pearlescent' paints and other special effects finishes such as tinted 'clearcoats,' already available in Japan. All of these developments will create big problems for the refinisher in extended repair times and the special skills required to duplicate the original finish. Part of the same problem is the whole question of colour matching. Vehicle manufacturers are introducing more than 1,000 new colours a year - and it can take about eight man-hours in the laboratory to produce a refinish paint formulation to match an original factory colour. Colour-matching systems are one of the refinish paintmaker's biggest financial commitments. The use of new materials on vehicles such as plastics and aluminium also affects colour matching, applications techniques and product technology. It is clear that in the coming years the environment will continue to be the single most important factor influencing new product development in refinish paints. In the past, different markets have had different refinish paint systems. The sophistication of current systems, and the level of research funding needed, means that we are moving rapidly towards global refinish paint technology, with fewer companies having the resources or commitment to continue to develop in this area. Moreover, continued reductions in paint solvent levels and improved applications techniques will inevitably result in the continued decline in the volume of refinish paint sales, though product costs will rise. There are six multinational companies producing paint for the UK market: Akzo, BASF (Glasurit and RM), DuPont, Hoechst (Herberts Standox and Spies Hecker), ICI and PPG. Industry observers ask if there is enough room for all these leading suppliers - or will changing strategies result in some of them increasing their market share by acquisition and in others selling off their refinish paint divisions?

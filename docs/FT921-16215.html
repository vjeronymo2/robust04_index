			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris rises to six-week high in quiet continental trading SPECIAL situations enlivened a quiet Friday on the Continent, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS achieved its best close since mid-November, driven higher by a firm bond market, Wall Street and demand for Total and Michelin. The CAC-40 index rose 20.39 or 1.2 per cent to 1,770.30, up 2.9 per cent on the week, in volume of FFr1.5bn. Total added FFr48 or 4.8 per cent to FFr1,033 with 175,975 shares traded following the overnight gains of its ADS's on Wall Street on renewed optimism about the company's Colombian oil find. Michelin rose FFr5.20 or 4.3 0 shares traded ahead of Monday's launch of its 'green' tyre at the Detroit motor show. But some analysts dismissed the talk as 'old hat'. Paribas, one of the worst performers last year, jumped FFr17.70 or 5.7 per cent to FFr327.50 as investors picked up cheap stocks. FRANKFURT ran into profit-taking which left it marginally better on the day, but 2.6 per cent up on the week measured by both FAZ and DAX indices which closed up 1.27 at 653.19, and 1.74 at 1,603.62 respectively. Volume was thin. Retailers fell on fears of disappointing Christmas sales. Asko dropped another DM15 to DM610 and Karstadt DM8 to DM630. In cars, Volkswagen fell DM4 to DM302.60 after its chairman, Mr Carl Hahn, told a magazine that 1991 production of Golf cars was below capacity. Porsche recovered DM27 to DM567, supported by a weak D-Mark. MILAN came off the day's lows on late demand for telecoms. The Comit index ended 0.38 higher at 507.81, up 2.2 per cent on the week. Turnover rose to L40bn from Thursday's pathetic L32bn. The bourse will be closed on Monday. The telecoms sector rose 0.48 per cent on foreign buying, with Sip and Stet adding L25 to L1,407 and L2,100 respectively. MADRID bounced on bargain hunting, with banks leading the rise. The general index closed 4.72 or 2 per cent higher at 243.65, up 2.7 per cent on the week. Bilbao Vizcaya rose Pta110 or 4.3 per cent to Pta2,660 and Banco Popular by Pta430 to Pta10,700. In oils and construction, Repsol gained Pta90 to Pta2,480 and Asland Pta75 to Pta1,830. BRUSSELS was upset by a trading error in this week's star performer, the retailer Delhaize. Delhaize closed down BFr360 at BFr8,550 francs after an erroneous sell order sent the price plummeting to BFr7,650 at the market's midsession. The Bel20 index fell 5.36 to 1,103.10 but was up 1.9 per cent on the week. OSLO was encouraged by foreign gains and the all-share index rose 8.14 to 427.07 in turnover worth NKr271m. All important sectors ended higher, and even the depressed banking sector managed a modest increase.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100 - Jan 3  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Open     10 am    11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     close 1083.96  1083.76  1086.74  1087.27  1087.42  1085.81  1086.79  1087.01  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Day's High  1104.38    Day's Low  1083.49  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Jan 2     Dec 31     Dec 30    Dec 27    Dec 24 1078.19   1079.41*   1065.54   1055.30   1042.60  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- * Partial.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy trade in RBOS A seemingly flawed trade in Royal Bank of Scotland prompted furious turnover in the banking sector as institutional investors used the funds generated to switch into Barclays. Dealers said one of the UK's leading integrated securities houses had taken a block of 2.5m Royal Bank shares on board at 242p, some 8p below the market price. It appeared that the house was unable to find buyers and passed the stake to rival Credit Lyonnais Laing which was happy to take it for 245p a share, still well below the market price. Mr Martin Hughes, Laing's banking analyst said: 'Our view is that the first seller took a very poor offer for the shares.' Royal Bank shares closed 8 lower at 448p with 5.8m traded. It was suspected that much of the cash generated went towards Barclays which has been benefiting from a big switch out of Lloyds Bank. Investors have been worried about Lloyds exposure to the mortgage market through its proposed acquisition of Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester building society. Those concerns were fuelled by figures published yesterday which showed that monthly mortgage lending fell by 6 per cent in October. Lloyds lost 6 1/2 at 567 1/2 p with turnover hitting 4.5m while Barclays held firm at 606 1/2 p with 8m changing hands.</p>

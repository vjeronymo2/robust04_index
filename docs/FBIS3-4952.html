The two men were charged and sentenced as enemies of the  nation and sentenced in absentia by the present regime following  the establishment of the Lao PDR [People's Democratic Republic]  in 1975. The men and their followers were recently charged by  the Thai authority for generating threat to security in Thailand  by destabilising security and order along the Lao-Thai border  with an intent to overthrow the regime of the Lao PDR, thus  jeopardising the relations of good neighbours between Laos and  Thailand, particularly threatening those living along the border.    Brigadier General Douangchai Phichit said that the bilateral  relations lately have seen marked progress, particularly since  the first through third meetings of the Joint Cooperation  Committee for Border Security and Order. This has created  favourable conditions for making the two countries's border a  border of peace and friendship. He pointed out that joint border  committees have been created in several places and memoranda of  understanding have been signed. One of the tasks of these  committees is to weed out bad elements that wish to create  trouble and destabilise the situation.    He concluded by hoping that the Thai authority will take  appropriate measures to deal not only with Vang Pao and Thonglit  Chokbengboun but others whose intention is to disturb peace and  security along the Lao-Thai border.</p>

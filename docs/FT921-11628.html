			<p>920130 FT  30 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: UK construction An election has to be in the offing when a government minister needs to exclude commercial property and make five-monthly comparisons to derive any satisfaction from the latest construction figures. That said, there is plausible evidence of a modest pick-up in construction orders from the private industrial sector between July and November last year. That is certainly consistent with the idea that companies will not wish to be left with outdated plant and equipment when a strong recovery finally materialises. Unfortunately, these tidings bring little comfort for investors in quoted contractors. As the Building Employers Confederation made clear over the weekend, many of its members are undertaking work on zero or negative margins as they compete fiercely for the dwindling volume of new commercial work. Returns on the civil side are more encouraging for the moment, but this will not necessarily last if everyone dives into the same market place. Any increase in orders is not to be sniffed at. But just as increased demand in the mortgage market will be slow to feed through into bigger profits for the housebuilders, so the contractors will have to wait awhile for better margins.</p>

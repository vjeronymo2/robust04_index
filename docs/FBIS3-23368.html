A  statement issued by the group, copies of which AL-HAYAH has  received in Peshawar by fax from abroad, says: "The Armed  Islamic Group in Algeria claims responsibility for the murder of  two French crusaders [salibiyyayn]." The statement adds: "This  operation falls within the program drawn up by the group to  eliminate any presence of Jews and Christians in the land of  Islam in Algeria." In its statement the group said that the  presence of the Jews, Christians, and polytheists in the land of  Islam is a direct support for an infidel and illegitimate  government which should be eliminated by the blade of the sword.

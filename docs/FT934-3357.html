			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / November truck sales 26% higher UK sales of new trucks were 26.5 per cent higher last month than in November last year as the recovery in demand for heavy commercial vehicles gathered pace. Registrations of new commercial vehicles rose 6.3 per cent in November year-on-year, the third consecutive monthly increase. Commercial vehicle sales remained depressed in the first half of the year. Yet in the past two months demand from the small-business and local-distribution sector has increased, with rising registrations of medium and heavy vans. The first signs of recovery came from the heavy-truck market late last year, as hauliers started to replace ageing fleets. Registrations of heavy trucks (above 15 tonnes) last month were 37 per cent higher than a year before. The UK is virtually the only truck market in west Europe in which demand is growing. UK truck registrations (above 3.5 tonnes gross vehicle weight) have risen by 15.5 per cent in the first 11 months. Truck sales across west Europe are forecast to plunge more than 20 per cent in the full year, the fourth successive annual decline. European truckmakers are concentrating intense marketing efforts on the UK, as they are hit by declining demand elsewhere. Both MAN of Germany and Scania of Sweden have increased their truck sales in the UK by more than 50 per cent this year. Volvo and Mercedes-Benz have achieved rises of nearly 30 per cent.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- UK COMMERCIAL VEHICLE REGISTRATIONS JANUARY-NOVEMBER 1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                             Volume      Volume   Share (%)   Share (%)                            (Units)  Change (%)  Jan-Nov 93  Jan-Nov 92  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Total Market*             186,284         -1.5       100.0       100.0 Imports                    77,326        +12.3        41.5        36.4  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Small vans (up to 1.8 tonnes) Total                      54,283        -10.0       100.0       100.0 Imports                    19,871        +37.8        36.6        23.9 Ford                       24,080        -12.5        44.4        45.6 Vauxhall (General Motors)  16,583        -14.1        30.5        32.0 PSA Peugeot Citroen         3,392         +4.9         6.2         5.4 Renault***                  3,247        +25.9         6.0         4.3 Rover (British Aerospace)   2,871        -28.7         5.3         6.7  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Medium vans &amp; pick-ups (1.81-3.5 tonnes) Total                      83,239         -0.4       100.0       100.0 Imports                    32,549         -1.2        39.1        39.4 Ford                       40,882         +7.9        49.1        45.3 Leyland DAF Vans            8,975        -26.9        10.8        14.7 Volkswagen                  5,939        +13.8         7.1         6.2 Mercedes-Benz (Daimler-   Benz)                     5,262        +11.6         6.3         5.6 Renault***                  4,561         +1.7         5.5         5.4 PSA Peugeot Citroen         4,246         +3.8         5.1         4.9 Nissan                      3,460        -10.4         4.2         4.6 Vauxhall (GM)               3,336        -10.3         4.0         4.4  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Trucks (over 3.5 tonnes) Total                      33,728        +15.5       100.0       100.0 Imports                    17,009        +43.1        50.4        40.7 Iveco group**(Fiat)         8,192        +22.5        24.3        22.9 Leyland DAF (DAF Trucks)    6,244        -16.4        18.5        25.6 Mercedes-Benz (Daimler-   Benz)                     5,957        +28.0        17.7        15.9 Volvo***                    4,352        +27.1        12.9        11.7 MAN                         2,013        +66.5         6.0         4.1 Renault***                  1,130         -6.5         3.4         4.1  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Of which Heavy Trucks (over 15 tonnes) Total                      19,216        +24.8       100.0       100.0 Volvo***                    3,969        +30.2        20.7        19.8 Iveco group**(Fiat)         2,877        +46.1        15.0        12.8 Scania (Investor)           2,689        +54.2        14.0        11.3 Leyland DAF (DAF Trucks)    2,637        -18.2        13.7        20.9 Mercedes-Benz (Daimler-   Benz)                     2,374        +21.6        12.4        12.7 ERF                         1,801        +17.1         9.4        10.0  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- (names in brackets indicate ownership) * includes buses and light four wheel drive utility vehicles. ** includes Iveco Ford and Seddon Atkinson. *** Renault and Volvo are linked through minority cross-shareholdings.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders and industry estimates.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

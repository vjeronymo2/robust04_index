			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Invesco at Pounds 18.7m as margins improve  -Better European outcome offsets fall in North America following increase in costs Invesco, the international fund management group, yesterday reported flat interim pre-tax profits as an improved European contribution offset a decline in North America. Mr Charles Brady, chairman, said the group felt it could afford to raise the interim dividend by 25 per cent to 1.25p because it had strengthened its balance sheet and increased its profit margins. Pre-tax profits for the six months to the end of June were Pounds 18.7m, against Pounds 23m which included exceptional profits of Pounds 4.04m. However, Mr Brady pointed out they were a significant improvement on last year's second half figure. Earnings per share were 5.3p (5.4p). He said it was a satisfactory performance given market conditions during the first-half. Funds under management slipped from Pounds 43bn to Pounds 42bn. In North America a rise in income to Pounds 62m (Pounds 56.7m) was more than offset by an increase in costs to Pounds 41.8m (Pounds 35.1m). The resulting pre-tax profit was Pounds 20.7m (Pounds 22.1m) Mr Brady said this reflected significant investment in administrative arrangements for defined contribution retirement plans for individual employees. This was a expanding area of business, but one in which the profits would not show through until next year. The results also showed Invesco's continuing rationalisation of its European operations. Income fell to Pounds 22.6m (Pounds 23m) but costs fell more sharply from Pounds 21.9m to Pounds 19.8m to give a pre-tax profit of Pounds 3.93m (Pounds 3.7m). Mr Norman Riddell, chief executive Europe, said he expected staffing of the European operation to fall further to fewer than 400 by the end of 1995, against 500 at the start of last year. He said that retail business in the UK had been recovering earlier than he had expected, and that business in France and eastern Europe had also been growing. The difficult area remained UK pension fund business. In the Pacific operation, income rose to Pounds 4.93m (Pounds 4.29m) but costs rose more steeply to Pounds 5.4m (Pounds 4.47m) as the region was formally set up and management strengthened. COMMENT Depending on which measurement you take, Invesco looks on the expensive side of the sector, or a bit undervalued. On a prospective p/e of 15.5 to 16, it is above the sector average. Yet Invesco is among the cheapest stocks measured by market value as a percentage of funds under management. Invesco's performance will continue to depend critically on market conditions and its ability to wring more profits from its funds under management. There are some encouraging signs in the European cost-cutting and in the profits which should come through from the US personal pensions business. Invesco's recovery phase is not yet over, but the results seem reassuring rather than the reverse.</p>

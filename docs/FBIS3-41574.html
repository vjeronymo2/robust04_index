			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] About 100 million baht has been set aside from the  5.5-billion-baht Environment Fund for distribution to private  organisations for environmental protection projects, Science,  Technology and Environment Deputy Permanent Secretary Athon  Supphapodok said yesterday.    Mr. Athon said the money has not yet been provided to any  private agency as the ministry has not yet completed drafting  regulations to control spending.    As the 100-million-baht allocation involves both a revolving  fund and grant aid, Mr. Athon said strict control is needed to  prevent any loopholes in funding administration.    Secretary-general of the Environmental Policy and Planning  Office Santhat Somchiwit said private projects aimed at solving  serious environmental problems such as forest deterioration and  water pollution will be given priority.    Mr. Santhat said private firms can apply for loans for the  construction of waste water or industrial waste treatment  systems. Nonprofit nongovernmental organisations can request  grants.    He said about 90 percent of the 100 million-baht fund will  go  to NGOs involved in environmental protection and conservation.  Each group is expected to receive about five million baht.    Special consideration and promotion will be given to  action-oriented projects whose implementation is practical and  has bright achievement prospects, said Mr. Santhat.    Thirty-three NGOs are registered as agencies working on  protecting the environment in Thailand.    Mr. Santhat said he wants NGOs to help ``narrow the gap''  between the state and the people over certain development  projects facing opposition from local people. Information about  those projects will be passed on to the NGOs for further  dissemination to the local people.    Although 100 million baht was considered minimal, Mr.  Santhat  said the amount could be adjusted in the future.    The Environment Fund was established under the 1992 National  Environmental Quality Preservation and Promotion Act, with  contributions of 5.5 billion baht. Seventy percent of the fund  was government allocation. The remaining 30 percent came from  the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).    Parts of the fund have already been provided for the  drafting  of provincial-level environmental protection master plans with  special focuses on installing waste water treatment systems and  tackling pollution, Mr. Santhat said.</p>

			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / International Capital Markets: Lively trade welcomes new Matif contract A FUTURES contract for five-year French government bonds began trading yesterday on the Matif, the French futures exchange. The move follows the recent launch of two five-year contracts: a German government bond (BOBL) contract on Liffe in London and an Italian government bond (BTP) contract on Italy's Mif. The bond contract, established to allow dealers to trade against its German equivalent as well as five-year underlying French bonds, saw some lively business, with around 6,800 lots dealt by the close of official business. Although volume was well below that of the comparable German contract, dealers said it was a healthy beginning. The Matif already lists a three-month Pibor interest rate contract, a seven to 10-year bond contract, and a 15 to 30-year bond contract. However, the 30-year contract, launched on January 28, is hardly traded.</p>

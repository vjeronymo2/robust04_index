			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERSONAL FINANCE: IT'S TIME TO START PLANNING FOR YOUR 1990 TAXES  </P> <P> It's almost over. Tax filing deadline is tomorrow. You won't have to worry  about deductions and credits and those lousy forms until next year, you say.  </P> <P> But that would be a big mistake.  </P> <P> The best time for tax planning is now, when you've just finished reviewing the  state of your finances in the course of doing your taxes. "Everything's fresh  in your mind now," says William G. Brennan, tax partner at the accounting firm  of Ernst &amp; Young in Washington.  </P> <P> Also, most tax-saving strategies are best put into effect early in the year,  not when Thanksgiving or Christmas roll around.  </P> <P> With that early-bird spirit in mind, here is a checklist of time-honored tax  planning tips that you can put into use now:  </P> <P> * Adjust your withholding. If you received or expect a big refund or paid a lot  of additional tax, it's time to redo your W-4 form. Getting refunds may be fun,  but what you're really doing is giving the government an interest-free loan of  your money.  </P> <P> * Organize your records. Resolve to spend a couple of hours each month to bring  your files up to date. "A good time to do that is when you are reconciling your  checkbooks and bank statements," says Julian Block, a Larchmont, N.Y., tax  attorney and author of "Julian Block's Year-Round Tax Strategies."  </P> <P> * Make gifts to children. A bill is under consideration in Congress to curb the  amount of assets you can give to your children, relatives or others each year  -- exempt of gift taxes -- to $30,000. Now, the limit is $10,000 in gifts per  person, but there is no limit as to how many individuals you can give to.  Accordingly, if you were planning to give -- as this is a good way to reduce  the amount in your estate that might be subject to estate taxes -- you might  want to write checks or give that stock now instead of later.  </P> <P> * Defer taxable income. If you earn a lot of taxable interest income from  ordinary savings accounts or money market mutual funds, consider buying  Treasury bills, Brennan suggests. Not only are they exempt from state tax (a  real advantage in a high-tax state such as California), they are not taxable on  the federal level until they mature. Thus, if you get a 12-month bill that  matures next year, you won't owe tax on the interest until you file your 1991  tax return in early 1992 -- two years from now (although you might have to make  estimated tax payments in the interim).  </P> <P> * Fund your IRA early. Waiting until April 15 of next year to make your  contribution for this year will mean you'll miss out on several months of  tax-deferred interest earnings. Over the years, the buildup in additional  earnings from funding your IRA early each year can amount to thousands and  thousands of dollars.  </P> <P> * Review your retirement plans. Is the investment mix in your IRA, Keogh,  401(k) or other retirement plan appropriate for your risk-tolerance, age and  investment outlook? Most people are inadequately diversified, having put too  much of their retirement eggs in the same basket.  </P> <P> * Review employee benefits. You may be missing out on some tax breaks in  company benefit plans out of ignorance or neglect. For example, many employees  don't enroll in flexible-spending accounts that allow them to use pretax money  on medical or child-care bills. Savings from these accounts can be quite  substantial, because you are using funds to pay bills that otherwise would have  gone to Uncle Sam in taxes.  </P> <P> * Consider savings bonds. Series EE bonds are now exempt from federal tax if  used to fund college education and if you meet certain income and other  criteria.  </P> <P> * Review your appreciated stocks. Instead of selling any stocks, bonds or  mutual funds on which you have a large capital gain, consider transferring them  to your children aged 14 or older, Brennan suggests. Thus the gains will be  taxed at their presumably lower rate.  </P> <P> * Update your beneficiaries. You may be unaware that the persons you named as  beneficiaries of your insurance policies or retirement plans automatically  acquire ownership of those assets upon your death independently of your will,  Block says. So if you have remarried and the beneficiary of your insurance  policy is your former spouse, you might want to update the policy.  </P> <P> * List your assets. If you haven't already done so, make a list of all your  assets, Block suggests. This can be useful for many things, including helping  the executor of your estate or other fiduciaries. That will save expense in the  administration of your estate. Keep a copy at home so your spouse or children  can find it.  </P> <P> * Educate yourself. YMCAs, community colleges and others offer good adult  education courses on tax and financial planning, Block suggests. But be wary of  courses sponsored by brokerage houses, insurance companies and others that may  be pushing a specific product, he says.  </P> <P> * Pay off personal debt. This is the last year you can deduct interest on  credit card and other non-mortgage debt, and that writeoff is only 10%. Next  year you get nothing.  </P></p>

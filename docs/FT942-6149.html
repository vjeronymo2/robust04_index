			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / People: Schroder's Mackenzie moves to run GE Capital in Europe GE Capital, the financial services arm of General Electric Company of the US, has recruited a London merchant banker to spearhead its European expansion. Christopher Mackenzie, 40, has resigned from J. Henry Schroder Wagg &amp; Co, to be the first president of GE Capital Europe. GE Capital provides around 40 per cent of its US parent's profits and Mackenzie has been given the task of putting its widely dispersed European operations on the map. GE Capital has 13 niche businesses in Europe, ranging from private label credit cards to car leasing, assets of Dollars 5bn, and employs 4,600 staff in 14 countries. Mackenzie, who has worked as a McKinsey management consultant as well as a merchant banker, hopes to double the size of the European business in the next three years. The choice of a merchant banker as president suggests that GE Capital will be making more acquisitions in the financial services industry. However, Mackenzie is keen to play down the role of acquisitions in his bid to develop a 'truly European financial institution'. In particular, he stresses that GE has no plans to buy a UK building society but is keen to explore ways GE Capital could supply financial services through 'alliances' with societies. 'We are well placed to be a friend,' says Mackenzie. In his previous position at Schroders, Mackenzie was responsible for the firm's pharmaceutical and chemical investment banking business for the bank's European clients. David Legg, one of GE Capital Europe's two joint managing directors, has retired and George Tappert continues as Mackenzie's deputy.</p>

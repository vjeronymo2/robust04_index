			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / Keen competition takes toll on US stores' margins TWO big US store chains, Texas-based JC Penney and Minnesota's Dayton Hudson, yesterday revealed a decline in core retailing margins during the second quarter of 1992, providing further evidence that the US retail industry remains highly competitive. Dayton Hudson, which takes in a mixture of department stores and discount outlets, said that after-tax profits in the three months to end-July fell to Dollars 24m, compared with Dollars 42m a year earlier. Sales were Dollars 4.29bn, compared with Dollars 4bn. Net earnings would have been even lower, at Dollars 19m, but for the inclusion of a non-recurring credit. Mr Kenneth Macke, Dayton's chairman, said that the company was 'very disappointed' with the second-quarter performance overall. He added that the Target discount stores, which form the largest division, performed well, with operating profits improving on a 5 per cent increase in same-store sales. But even here, gross margins fell due to price reductions, part of a strategy of 'value-pricing'. Target did, however, see some improvement in the 'mark-down' rate, and its operating expense ratio also showed a slight improvement. The other two divisions - the department stores and the Mervyn's chain  - both reported a fall in operating profits and deteriorating gross margins. The second-quarter results mean that Dayton's first-half earnings stand at Dollars 54m after tax, down from Dollars 77m at the same stage last year. Sales in the first half were Dollars 8.33bn, compared with Dollars 7.69bn. At JC Penney, after-tax earnings reached Dollars 112m in the second quarter, an improvement on the Dollars 80m in the same period of 1992, while sales rose to Dollars 3.96bn, against Dollars 3.79bn. However, the company said that the advance was due to 'an outstanding performance' by the catalogue division, lower expenses and a 'significant rise' in the profitability of the insurance division. Gross margins, as a percentage of sales, fell to 31.7 per cent from 32.4 per cent a year ago. Mr William Howell, chairman, said that the decline was expected 'because the company's strategy in the intensely competitive retail environment has been to stress unit sales and lower initial price points'. On Wall Street, shares in JC Penney closed up Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 45 3/4 on the news, while Dayton Hudson lost Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 67 1/4.</p>

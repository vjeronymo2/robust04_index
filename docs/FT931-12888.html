			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Dilemma over dealing with City cases: Efforts to find a solution to long, complicated trials THE QUESTION of whether cases such as the Blue Arrow fraud trial should have been dealt with by the criminal courts or by the City regulators was central to the Bar working party's efforts to find a solution to the problems of long fraud trials. The Blue Arrow trial, which ended last February, lasted a year and four days. Four men were convicted of conspiracy to defraud after the 1987 Pounds 873m failure of the Blue Arrow rights issue - the convictions were quashed on appeal. 'Certainly the Stock Exchange felt at the time it could have dealt with it more effectively and speedily. Hopefully Blue Arrow was a one-off,' says Mr Jeremy Roberts QC, chairman of the working party. Criminal offences involving fraud or financial irregularity embrace an enormous range of degrees of culpability. At one extreme there are blatant cases of dishonesty, which Mr Roberts says should always be dealt with by the criminal courts. At the other end of the scale are a variety of offences, many of a technical nature, where the defendant has 'broken the rules', but neither desired nor expected that anyone else would lose money. The Bar believes there is a strong argument that many such offences would be better dealt with in some other way than devoting a large amount of public time and money to a criminal prosecution. The problem is how to decide which cases can be left to City regulators and which cases must be dealt with by the courts. It suggests that the solution hinges on the likely penalty for the offence. If there is a risk that the accused will be sent to prison if convicted, the case should be dealt with by the courts. If the likely outcome is a fine, a conditional discharge or some other non-custodial sentence, the case ought normally to be dealt with by disciplinary proceedings. This risk should be assessed in discussion between City regulators and the Serious Fraud Office. Mr Roberts accepts that allowing City regulators to deal with City offences may be perceived by the public as a 'soft option' for the accused. The accusation might be levelled that 'shoplifters go to prison; white-collar criminals don't' But the Bar believes the penalties disciplinary tribunals can impose are quite stringent. Infringement of City rules can result in financial penalties, suspension or termination of membership of a professional or self regulatory body and an order to compensate the victims of any financial irregularity. City disciplinary systems are also capable of reaching a much speedier resolution. An examination of cases dealt with by the Securities and Futures Association shows that in most cases the delay between the commencement of an investigation and conclusion of the case is between two and four months. It has taken seven years to reach the end of the prosecutions arising out of the 1986 Guinness takeover of Distillers. But the Bar accepts that, to reassure the public, steps will have to be taken to make City disciplinary proceedings more transparent. While plea-bargaining and disciplinary proceedings continue to be held in private, it will be very difficult to ensure public confidence in them. The onus is on the City to address this problem. The Bar also recommends that the Serious Fraud Office and the Crown Prosecution Service have the power to 'compound' - to agree, in suitable cases, to accept a financial penalty as an alternative to bringing criminal charges. The Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise currently have this power. In many cases, compounding might be the most effective way of obtaining recompense for the victims of fraud, Mr Roberts says. Recent lengthy financial trials include: GUINNESS 1: three men were jailed and a fourth fined for offences of theft, conspiracy to defraud and false accounting arising out of the 1986 Pounds 2.72bn Guinness takeover of Distillers. The trial lasted six months. BRITANNIA THEME PARK: the UK's longest criminal trial started in September 1990 and ended in February 1992. Four men were jailed and a fifth was fined over the 1985 collapse of the Britannia Theme Park at Shipley, Derbyshire, with debts of Pounds 9.34m. BARLOW CLOWES: almost a year ago Mr Peter Clowes was jailed for theft and fraud after the Pounds 150m collapse of his investment company Barlow Clowes. The trial lasted seven months. BLUE ARROW: four men were convicted of conspiracy to defraud after the 1987 Pounds 873m failure of the Blue Arrow rights issue in a trial of a year and four days. The convictions were quashed on appeal. GUINNESS 2: the trial was abandoned last February after five months because of the ill-health of one of the two defendants, former merchant banker Mr Roger Seelig.</p>

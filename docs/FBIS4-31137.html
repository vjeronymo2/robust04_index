			<p>BFN     [Text] A session of the Presidential Council of Defense and  National Security was held in the presidential palace today  under the chairmanship of President Franjo Tudjman. The Council  discussed the economic and other prerequisites for making the  kuna a hard currency, the presidential office announced today.    Prime Minister Nikica Valentic told the Council that the  monetary reform in Croatia has been wound up by the introduction  of a new Croatian currency whose international code is HRK 191.  The stable and convertible kuna is a prerequisite for the  further development of the Croatian economy.    Valentic stressed that the government will continue to  implement the stabilization program and to reform the Croatian  economy. A significant production increase has been registered  for the first time since 1987. The government will insist on  financial discipline in payment transactions. Croatia has met  all IMF conditions by implementing its economic program and is  expected to sign a letter of intent with the IMF and conclude  financial agreements with leading international financial  institutions in the next few months.    The Council commended the government, Prime Minister Nikica  Valentic, and Pero Jurkovic, governor of the National Bank of  Croatia, for their efforts toward the introduction of the kuna  and creating conditions for overall international financial  support and development and for Croatia's economic renewal. The  Council also discussed some foreign policy issues and Croatia's  international position. The Council was informed about the  construction of the Altar of the Homeland, a monument erected on  Mount Medvednica overlooking Zagreb in memory of heroes who fell  for Croatia's freedom, the Croatian president's office has  announced.</p>

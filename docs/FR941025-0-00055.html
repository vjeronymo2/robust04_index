			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One comment requested that the regulations clarify the use of the term ``highest adjacent grade'' compared to the term ``existing grade'' that is used in the statute. The term ``highest adjacent grade'' is used in the interim final rule at paragraph 60.3(f)(3)(i). This paragraph establishes the elevation that must be used for applying the floodplain management requirements in areas within Zone AR designated as a ``developed area'' for new construction and in other areas in Zone AR where the AR flood depth is five feet or less. In these areas, the requirement is to apply the lower of either the AR base flood elevation or the elevation that is three feet above highest adjacent grade. FEMA used the term ``highest adjacent grade'' since it is already defined in the regulations. ``Highest adjacent grade'' in the NFIP regulations is defined as ``the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure''. The definition in the regulations provides guidance on the reference point from which to measure the elevation of three feet when a proposed site is sloped. Also, by applying a single reference point, communities can consistently apply the elevation requirements to structures. Therefore, FEMA does not believe the term ``highest adjacent grade'' is inconsistent with the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> National Environmental Policy Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FEMA has determined, based upon an environmental assessment, that this interim final rule will not have a significant impact upon the quality of the human environment.

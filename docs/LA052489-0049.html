			<p><P> May 24, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KEY ISRAELIS REJECT BAKER'S PLEA ON LAND  </P> <P> Pleading that they are not prepared to face the issue now, top Israeli  officials on Tuesday dismissed a call by Secretary of State James A. Baker III  that Israel give up the "unrealistic vision" of a greater Israel.  </P> <P> In London, where he was on an official visit, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir  said it is "useless, quite useless" for the Bush Administration to raise the  issue of Israel's borders. He said that giving up the occupied West Bank and  Gaza Strip in order to achieve peace is a "theoretical formula, and I don't  think we have to discuss it now."  </P> <P> Shamir criticized Baker for suggesting that Israel is seeking territorial  grandeur through its control of the West Bank and Gaza.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Very Small Country'  </P> <P> "I don't know how anyone could speak at all of a large Israel," Shamir said on  Israeli radio. "Israel is a very small country, and all of us know that its  territory is very limited. It really sounds ironic to speak of Israel as big."  </P> <P> Foreign Minister Moshe Arens criticized Baker for daring to define which  aspirations are realistic for Israel and which are not.  </P> <P> "These are our dreams," Arens said in an interview from Brussels. "We are  speaking about our country, and we have proven that we fulfill our dreams."  </P> <P> The question of Israeli territorial dreams was the dominant topic in public  debate on comments Baker made Monday in a speech to a pro-Israeli lobby in  Washington. The speech was widely viewed as the clearest expression to date of  Washington's policy toward the Israeli-Palestinian conflict -- and the fullest  outline of issues separating the United States and Israel.  </P> <P> In Jerusalem, politicians on the right challenged Baker's ability to limit  Israel's dreams, while politicians on the left insisted that the country has  yet to decide whether it will keep the land.  </P> <P> "They want to dictate to us not only the political plans and political  initiative, they want to dictate to us also our dreams -- what to dream about  and what not to dream about," complained Geula Cohen, a member of the  right-wing Tehiya party.  </P> <P> Shimon Peres, leader of the centrist Labor Party, cautioned: "I disagree with  the secretary that the . . . dream of a greater Israel is the policy of the  present government."  </P> <P> It appeared to some Israelis that Baker was trying to force an issue that  Israeli leaders had striven to avoid: a decision on the final status of the  West Bank and Gaza.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Favors Holding Land  </P> <P> Shamir's Likud Party, the dominant bloc in the ruling coalition, favors holding  on to the land forever. Peres' Labor Party, the junior partner, is willing to  surrender some of the territory in return for a peace settlement.  </P> <P> "The American request cannot be answered," Alon Liel, a Foreign Ministry  spokesman, said. "If we respond to it, the government will fall apart. If we do  not, we will not find an Arab partner to talk peace."  </P> <P> Liel said that Israel prefers a step-by-step approach that leaves for later  consideration the contentious issue of who controls the land.  </P> <P> Israel has offered a plan for elections in the West Bank and Gaza to select a  Palestinian peace delegation. Members of the delegation would have to accept  five years of self-rule under Israeli authority as a condition for taking part  in final talks. The final talks would begin three years into the period of  self-rule.  </P> <P> Arens, upon ending a visit to Washington this week, said that Israel had won  "unreserved American support" for the peace plan. But U.S. officials indicated  that the plan falls short in important details.  </P> <P> </P> <P> In 'Horrible' Mood  </P> <P> Foreign Ministry officials said that Arens' mood on learning of the Baker  speech was "horrible."  </P> <P> It was the second time this year that Arens has left Washington at odds with  Baker. Just after Arens' first visit, in March, Baker told Congress that Israel  might some day have to talk with the Palestine Liberation Organization in order  to achieve peace. Israeli officials considered Baker's statement a slip of the  tongue. Israel officially opposes contact with the PLO.  </P> <P> Now, no one is mistaking Baker's tone.  </P> <P> "This indicates Baker means business," a Foreign Ministry official said.  </P> <P> Besides the flap over the land-for-peace formula, Israeli leaders also attacked  Baker's suggestions on ways to ease tension in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.  </P> <P> Baker called on Israel to stop building settlements in the occupied  territories. About 70,000 Israelis live in 139 settlements there, and the  government has agreed to build five more this year.  </P> <P> Palestinians reacted cautiously to the Baker speech. Newspaper editor Ziad abu  Ziad, a PLO supporter, said, "I believe Baker's statement is positive . . . but  it is not the change that the Palestinian is asking for."  </P> <P> Pro-PLO leader Sari Nusseibeh described Baker's speech as a positive sign but  said its impact will depend on Israeli reaction.  </P> <P> Palestinians in the occupied territories have rejected the Israeli election  plan.  </P></p>

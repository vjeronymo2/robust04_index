Mellon Foundation to establish a curatorial support program.  </P> <P> In accepting the grant, museum director Earl A. Powell III said: "The scholarly  function of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art will be greatly enhanced by  this generous grant from the Mellon Foundation. It will be a major step for  greater scholarly research, publication and preparation of exhibitions by the  curatorial staff, especially the promising young and mid-level curators, whose  work is often not funded by Federal and corporate support."  </P> <P> The money will be used to increase the museum's number of scholarly  exhibitions.  </P></p>

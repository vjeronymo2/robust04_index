			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 7 (XINHUA) -- Ten years of successful  cooperation between the United Technology Company (UTC) and its  Chinese partners led the company to decide to expand its  presence in China by entering into the country's aircraft  industry.    George David, president of UTC, made the statement here on a  recent visit to sign an agreement with China. According to the  agreement, UTC will invest another 12 million U.S. dollars in  the Tianjin Otis Elevator Company -- one of UTC's ten joint  ventures with China established ten years ago.    "The step indicates that UTC is not only satisfied with the  operation of this joint venture, but also confident in expanding  its business in China," David said, adding that all ten  UTC-China joint ventures producing elevators and air  conditioners are doing very well.    Their total sales last year reached 500 million U.S.  dollars,  and orders for Tianjin Otis stood at 300 million U.S. dollars in  volume.    "The success of the companies shows that our prospect in  China is very bright, and we should take root here," he said.    Since China will further its development of the  transportation industry including aircraft manufacturing to  conform to its rapidly- developing economy, UTC would positively  take part in China's development in this regard, said the  president, whose company ranked 16th in 1992.    He recalled that the company exported turbines to China in  1986 and bought components of jet engines from the country.    UTC will not only expand its business in this field, but  also  hope to set up joint ventures, David said.    Commenting on China's investment environment, David, who has  visited China many times over the last ten years, said that what  impressed him most is that many Chinese officials, especially  high- ranking officials, handle affairs in a decisive manner,  and are very far-sighted. They are able to set foreign  investors' minds at ease.    The president attributed the success of the joint ventures  between UTC and the cities of Tianjin and Shanghai to the  support of Li Ruihuan and Zhu Rongji, former mayors of the two  cities when the companies were established.    The improving legal system in China has also made foreign  investors feel safer, he said, adding that China's reform  approach this year is designed to make conditions more favorable  to foreign investors.</p>

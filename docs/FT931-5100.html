			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / Arts: Steven Wright - Comedy The stage is bare apart from an armchair illuminated by a spotlight. No, not Mastermind; something much more challenging and disturbing. A complete scruff wanders on, dressed in black, with his long hair divided by a balding dome, like a mad professor. He sits down, picks up a microphone and is away. 'When we landed I forgot to take off my seat belt. I discovered I was hauling the aircraft through the terminal.' For well over an hour Steven Wright, perhaps the most admired of American stand up comedians, fires off terse one liners, which are not exactly jokes, more bizarre twists to accepted speech and reality. The delivery is relentless; the face deadpan; the variation minimal. Yet Wright creates an entirely credible world and lets slip an awful lot about himself and American society. Some of it is childish riddles: 'what do you put under coasters?'. Some of it sixth form word play: 'I like to reminisce with people I don't know'. Some of it is mildly amusing: 'Why are ballerinas always on tip toes? Why not get taller women'. And some of it weird: 'You never know what you've got til it's gone. I wanted to find out so I got rid of everything'. This is the kind of act that can get very tedious. I smiled occasionally while all around people were laughing hysterically. The skill is that purile jokes - 'I bought a de-caffeinated coffee table' - are easily swallowed in the incessant flow, and that there is a sinister undertow which keeps you hooked. Wright talks a lot about his grandfather, with some typical exchanges. 'Here's Dollars 5. Don't tell your mother I'm giving it to you.' 'It will cost more than that.' The act enters the truly oddball when Wright picks up his guitar to sing about a two-day-old baby girl who he has foretold will become a prostitute. It is disturbingly funny. You realise that there is some method, some underlying cohesion behind what seems to be random quips. The gap between funny-ha-ha and funny-strange has been bridged. Wright projects the image of the freewheeling American who hates cops and regimentation. Yet there is minimal swearing; minimal political correctness; minimal posturing. There are hints of Tom Lehrer and a bit of Garrison Keiller. Sometimes his desire to turn the real world on its head - 'I like to skate on the other side of the ice' - becomes formulaic but Wright is an original, imaginative, rare talent. Like most comedians, you can tell whether you are going to enjoy the act in the first minute. Wright was too predictably smart-assed for my taste, but I can appreciate his appeal.

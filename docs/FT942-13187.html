			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / International Company News: DuPont jumps 39% to Dollars 642m Shares in DuPont, the US chemicals group, jumped by Dollars 3 1/2 to close at Dollars 58 1/8 yesterday as the company reported a 39 per cent jump in underlying net income to Dollars 642m for the first quarter - its best performance in any quarter since 1990. Mr Edgar Woolard, chief executive, said the biggest factor in the profits increase was lower costs. 'Although not yet complete, the restructuring efforts are having a significant effect on our bottom line performance,' he said. However, Mr Woolard said the group was seeing increased demands in important markets for a number of its businesses, including automotive products, engineering polymers, nylon, Lycra spandex, and non-wovens. 'Not only is demand generally improved in the US, but market conditions are better in Europe and Asia, where our chemicals and specialties sales are up 15 per cent and 6 per cent respectively,' Mr Woolard said First-quarter turnover was Dollars 9.19bn, up Dollars 120m or 1 per cent over the previous year's figure. The net earnings of Dollars 642m, or 94 cents a share, compared with Dollars 493m, or 73 cents a share, last time. But last year's figure included a non-recurring Dollars 32m gain from an exchange of North Sea petroleum properties. Petroleum segment earnings rose to Dollars 215m from Dollars 200m last time, excluding the prior year gain. Stronger domestic downstream performance, reflecting higher refined product margins, helped outweigh the drop in upstream earnings resulting from a 20 per cent fall in crude oil prices. All other segments increased earnings. Chemicals earned Dollars 83m, up from Dollars 69m; fibres reported Dollars 144m, up from Dollars 102m; polymers earned Dollars 147m, compared with Dollars 77m; and diversified business made Dollars 148m, against Dollars 107m.</p>

			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / German Elections: Quirk of voting system may deny Kohl victory - Germany's Chancellor could be victim of his own success if coalition partners fail 5% hurdle The one dark doubt that must linger in the mind of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, as he approaches Sunday's general election, is that he may yet win the poll  -and still lose the contest to form the next coalition. He is campaigning flat out for all the votes he can get, and yet ironically, he ought to be giving some away to ensure that he can carry on as chancellor for another four years. 'We have no votes to lend, and none to give away,' Mr Kohl insists. Logic indicates otherwise. All the opinion polls suggest that he has pulled his Christian Democratic Union back in front of all contenders, with around 42 per cent of popular support shared with its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union. The most probable outcome is therefore a continuation of the conservative-liberal coalition, with the CSU and the liberal Free Democratic Party, but with a reduced majority. The trouble for Mr Kohl is that the FDP, chronically weak in a series of state elections, may fail to win enough seats to give him a clear majority. If simultaneously, the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), the reformed communists from East Germany, gets into the Bundestag, the coalition calculations will be very finely balanced. The key to it all lies in the German twin-vote system, which is essentially a system of proportional representation, but with a particular German twist. First votes are for individual candidates in their constituencies, but it is the second votes - for party lists in each state - which decide the make-up of the Bundestag, the directly elected parliament. Regardless of how many seats they win on the first vote, the final division of the Bundestag is based entirely on the second vote. It is thus second votes which count, although opinion polls suggest that only some 45 per cent of the electorate realise this. The first votes only decide the personalities who are guaranteed places among the successful candidates on the party list. To make the grade at all, a party must win at least 5 per cent of the second votes, setting a hurdle which most of the fringe parties, including the far-right Republicans and Deutsche Volksunion, have found impossible to cross. That is the hurdle which the FDP may fail to clear, as it has failed in the last seven state elections. The Greens failed in 1990, but look likely to make it this time. But there is an exception to the rule, which the PDS in east Germany hopes to exploit. If a party can win at least three seats directly on the first vote, it can claim whatever percentage of the second votes it wins in the Bundestag, even if it is less than 5 per cent. Mr Gregor Gysi, the PDS leader in the outgoing Bundestag, is hoping to win his own seat and two others in east Berlin, and thus claim anything up to 30 seats in the Bundestag, based on a probable proportion of second votes of around 4 per cent. He could well end up holding the balance of power between the CDU/CSU and the SPD/Greens. Christian Democrat voters thus face a very tough decision on a national basis, and a very easy one in east Berlin. In the first place, they must decide whether they can afford to give any second votes away to the FDP, to guarantee the continuation of the present coalition. The votes could be wasted if the FDP fails to make 5 per cent, and then the CDU would be doubly weakened. Or they could be just what Mr Kohl needs to ensure that the FDP gets more than 5 per cent, thus enabling him to reform the current coalition. West German tradition suggests that the FDP will get enough CDU second votes to get by. But the same tradition has no roots among the newly enfranchised voters in the east. The 5 per cent will be harder to come by than it has ever been before. The easy decision is for CDU supporters in those seats in east Berlin which the PDS hopes to win. They can afford to give their first votes to the SPD candidates most likely to defeat the PDS, and still give their crucial second votes to the CDU: the individual PDS candidates can be defeated, but the CDU will remain just as strong overall in the Bundestag. The problem for Mr Kohl is twofold. He cannot be seen to be encouraging his supporters to practise such cynical tactical voting. But he cannot be sure that they understand the voting system well enough to realise that giving away their first votes will not harm the CDU at all. Strong rumours from east Germany suggest that CDU party workers are trying to spread the message to keep the PDS out of the Bundestag with the first votes. It may not be clear until past midnight on Sunday night whether they have succeeded. Editorial comment, Page 17</p>

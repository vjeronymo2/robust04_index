			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Lowest inflation for 4 years fails to revive pound: Industry chiefs call for boost to demand - Tarmac closes four plants BRITAIN yesterday moved closer to the government's goal of zero inflation as official figures showed that prices in the 12 months to August rose by 3.6 per cent, the smallest annual increase for more than four years. But the good news on inflation failed to boost the flagging pound, which closed last night less than 1 1/2 pfennigs above its DM2.7780 floor in the European exchange rate mechanism. As Mr John Major, the prime minister, welcomed the drop in inflation, Tarmac, Britain's biggest construction and materials group, gave a harsh reminder of the country's current woes. The company said it was to close four plants and cut brick and concrete block production sharply in response to the construction industry's problems. The 0.1 per cent rise in retail prices last month was the smallest increase in any August since 1982. The 3.6 per cent inflation rate in the 12 months to August compared with 3.7 per cent in the year to July. The rate of price increases excluding mortgage interest payments - often taken as a measure of underlying inflation - dropped to 4.2 per cent from 4.4 per cent, the lowest annual figure since April 1988. According to the Central Statistical Office, which released the figures, many of last year's price increases were not repeated last month at the end of a difficult summer for retailers. Mr Major, who has put the defeat of inflation at the heart of his economic policy, said Britain was making the 'most substantial progress in inflation seen for many years'. At a press conference in Edinburgh he said: 'We have now got inflation down to levels it has only touched briefly in the last quarter of a century. What is different is that it looks as though this is a secure reduction of underlying inflation that will be sustainable in the future.' Mr Major said low inflation would improve Britain's competitive position and bring more jobs and greater prosperity. The better-than-expected news on inflation, however, came at the end of a week of further gloomy news on the economy. On Thursday, the Confederation of British Industry said most retailers did not expect consumer confidence to improve before the end of the year while official figures yesterday showed a 5 per cent fall in construction output in the three months to June 30, compared with the same period a year ago. Also this week, several corporate leaders, including Sir Clifford Chetwood and Sir Owen Green, chairmen of Wimpey and BTR respectively, called on urged the government to take steps to boost demand. Mr Alan Sugar, chairman of Amstrad, the computer company, yesterday added his voice, saying the government should do more to encourage consumer spending. 'I think they should switch attention from inflation to expanding the economy. We have to encourage people to spend again. We cannot employ more people until we sell more goods,' he said. In London the pound dipped close to its floor as it continued to come under pressure against the D-Mark. It closed at DM2.7900, up a quarter of a pfennig on the day. Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor of the exchequer, said that the government should be taking action to revive the economy. 'When Japan, with 2 per cent inflation and 2 per cent unemployment, takes urgent measures to revive the economy, Britain, with 10 per cent unemployment and entering the third year of recession, should be acting now,' he said. Shares shrugged off the pound's lacklustre performance, encouraged by the better-than-expected inflation figures. The FT-SE 100 index closed up 30.3 on the day at 2,370.9.

			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Finance and the Family: House ruling cheers buyers A RECENT Court of Appeal decision should give cheer to any housebuyer who has been gazumped - that is, ditched by a vendor in favour of someone offering a higher price. Last week, the Court of Appeal found in favour of Timothy Pitt, a broker who had entered into a written 'lock-out' agreement with PHH Asset management, a Swindon-based firm which was acting as agent for a Pounds 200,000 Suffolk cottage. The agreement was that PHH should accept no other offers provided Pitt exchanged contracts within 14 days after the receipt of draft contracts. But before the two weeks were up, the firm said it was accepting a higher offer unless Pitt wished to match it. He declined. Since he had spent money on arranging bridging loans and plans for an extension, and had advertised his home for sale in the press, he sued for damages - and won. PHH then lodged its appeal. Rejecting it, the court ruled that the agreement was a valid contract binding on both parties. Since this had been broken by PHH, it was liable to pay compensation. Tony Clark, general secretary of the National Association of Estate Agents, said he was 'delighted' at the decision but did not think it had far-reaching implications for the housing market. 'This case was unusual in that Pitt was wise enough to obtain an undertaking from the vendor that it would not offer the property to another party within the 14-day period,' he said. 'Most vendors will not want to enter into this option for the purchaser to purchase and to exclude others.' The Consumers Association agrees. 'We welcome the decision in principle. If lock-out agreements became common, they would do a lot to stop gazumping but the problem is that sellers do not want to tie themselves down,' a spokesman said. Only in a buyers' market, or a situation where the vendor was under pressure to dispose of a property, might sellers go along with a 'lock-out' agreement under which no other offer would be accepted within a prescribed period. John Samson, property partner at law firm Nabarro Nathanson, said that while the case did not change anything at the moment, it provided a way to create a system under which house buying could be made an easier and more pleasant experience. 'At the moment, neither party trusts the other. This is a method of creating much more goodwill in conveyancing transactions and would put an end to instant gazumping,' he said. The firm has drawn up two different forms of standard lock-out agreement, written in layman's English, which it hopes estate agents and the public will use. That is fine for buyers - but what guarantee does the vendor have that the prospective purchaser is serious in the first place? Samson said the purchaser would have to commission a survey and he would have a duty to tell the vendor if he decided not to continue with the purchase during the determined period - at which point the agreement would become void. The NAEA has urged the government to introduce some form of conditional contract under which both buyer and seller would agree on a price for the property once the buyer's offer was accepted. 'All European Community countries, apart from England, have conditional contracts,' Clark said.</p>

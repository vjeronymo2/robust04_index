			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / International Company News: Skanska acquisitions double US presence Skanska, the Swedish construction and real estate group, has acquired Beers Construction Company, a leading building company in the south-east US, and CPI, a technical company based near New York. The acquisitions will double the size of Skanska's US operations. The announcement comes within a week of a declaration by Mr Melker Schorling, chief executive, that Skanska intended to increase its non-Swedish operations to about 40 per cent of group revenue following a slump in its home market which led to losses in 1992. Last year, foreign business accounted for 23 per cent of the group's SKr28.9bn (Dollars 3.7bn) sales. Skanska did not disclose the price of Beers and CPI. 'Skanska is already a market leader in the New York area,' Mr Schorling said. 'With the acquisition of Beers we now hold a similar position in the growth areas of the south-east. By purchasing CPI we are simultaneously supplementing our resources with increased technical competence, making us a full-service organisation in the US.' Beers specialises in building hospitals, schools, industrial buildings and sports facilities.</p>

			<p><P> November 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EAST GERMANY OPENS THE BERLIN WALL  </P> <P> My wife and I have followed the events in Berlin. When the "crossing" was  announced, tears formed in my eyes. I was dramatically reminded of our  country's freedom.  </P> <P> A generation of Germans was permitted to experience what we, as Americans, can  take for granted. We visited East and West Berlin a few years ago. To see the  city, the wall, and the Brandenburg Gate from both sides was sobering.  </P> <P> The wall is now breached! Surely it must give genuine happiness for Americans  to know that native Berliners are now granted the privilege of visiting a part  of their own city.  </P> <P> ALBIN JOHNSON, Anaheim  </P></p>

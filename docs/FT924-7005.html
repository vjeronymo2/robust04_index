			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Survey of Turkish Finance, Investment and Industry (8): A wider market is sought - Gold may be given its freedom THERE ARE growing mutterings that the government is considering lifting the remaining restrictions on Turkey's fledgling gold market. Three years after gold trading was approved, officials are studying the possibility of freeing the import of gold, which is still a central bank monopoly, opening a refinery, and making a paper-based market to trade in the precious commodity. With the republics of the former Soviet Union searching for outlets for their gold production, Turkey has revived the search for a gold trading market. Mr Yarun Toruner, the head of the Istanbul stock exchange, is said to be considering establishing a paper-based market in the covered bazaar, where much of the gold trading currently takes place. Traders say such a market would provide a useful hedge for gold manufacturers. Turkey today has a flourishing jewellery business, fuelled in large part by the tourist trade. Turkey is also a hub of a large regional trade. The country is the largest gold consumer in the Middle East. According to Gold Fields Mineral Services, of London, the Middle East accounts for about 30 per cent of the world's supply of scrap gold. The World Gold Council recently opened an office in Istanbul. Gold News, a magazine for the trade, now has some 3,000 local subscribers. The country is still considered a cheap place to buy gold. In 1991, the central bank sold 113 tones. The Bank sells on a consignment basis, using two designated banks and 26 approved exchange dealers, at the official international price plus freight and insurance charges. Traditionally, about half the imports are re-exported as fabricated gold. Perhaps as much as 10 per cent of Turkey's imported gold is produced as the Republic coins. In many Turkish families, gold is still held as a hedge against rapid inflation and a depreciating currency. Historically, many of the Ottoman government officials returning home after the collapse of the empire found gold a convenient commodity to bring with them. Traders also hope some of the 5,000 tonnes, which is estimated to be hoarded away, may come to the market. The problem, as ever, is one of control. Before the mid-1980s, gold trading was an illicit activity. The establishment of an official market for the commodity is widely acknowledged as one of the best examples of Turkey's drive to liberalise its financial markets under the former Ozal administration.</p>

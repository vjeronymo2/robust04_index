			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Renewed fighting feared between Moslems and Croats in the west COMMANDERS of the Moslem-led Bosnian army fear the eruption of renewed clashes with Croat forces in spite of pledges by both sides to support an international peace plan for Bosnia-Hercegovina. Bosnian commander Humo Esad said this week that the fractured alliance would break down completely after the declaration last weekend of the Croatian Defence Council (HVO), the military wing of Bosnia's Croatian Democratic Union, the sister of the ruling party of Croatia. The HVO set an April 15 deadline for Moslem forces to withdraw from provinces designated to Croat control under the peace plan of Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, United Nations mediators. 'We are ready to fight if we must. But it will be a dangerous political game for Croats to play now,' said Cmdr Esad, who believes the HVO statement makes renewed clashes inevitable in central Bosnia. The HVO declaration means they want Cmdr Esad and his men to withdraw from Mostar, even though it is their home town. 'They may try to assert control in the smaller towns rather than risk fighting in Mostar,' he said of Bosnia's second-biggest city which over the last year of war has shrunk to some 30,000 people, many Moslem refugees from Serb and Croat-held territory. Some 50,000 fled the once picturesque southern city on the banks of the River Neretva, where Moslems comprised 41 per cent, Croats 39 per cent and Serbs under 20 per cent. Western diplomats believe renewed fighting between Moslem and Croat forces could deal a death blow to the Vance-Owen plan. 'We will find out in the next few days,' said a diplomat this week. Under the international peace plan, endorsed by Mr Alija Izetbegovic, Bosnia's Moslem President, and Mr Mate Boban, the Croat nationalist leader, Mostar is one of three provinces which would be designated to Croat control. Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic at the weekend rejected the plan to divide Bosnia into 10 ethnic provinces despite threats of stepped-up sanctions. Mr Boban, like Mr Karadzic, his Serbian counterpart, last year declared his own national mini-state of Herceg-Bosna. 'The HVO wants to unite with Croatia. They have the same uniforms, badges and symbols. Every day there is more proof of what they are doing here,' says Cmdr Esad. The red-and-white checkerboard Croatian symbol is emblazoned on flags and number plates throughout Mostar except in the ruined centre, where the blue and yellow fleur-de-lys marks Bosnian government control. The Croatian dinar is the most-used local currency. The HVO has added influence over the Bosnian forces because they control five of the power stations on the River Neretva. Cmdr Esad, the second in command in Mostar, says the Croats have constantly blocked the delivery of weapons to the mostly Moslem Bosnian forces and emergency relief to Moslem refugees. 'The regular Croatian Army takes 50 per cent. The HVO then takes another 50 per cent - leaving us with next to nothing,' he said bitterly. The stormy alliance collapsed but in January was patched up under a ceasefire brokered by Mr Vance and Lord Owen. Despite the truce, the outgunned Moslems are gloomy about the prospects for peace with the Croats and the Serbs. 'Serbs are kicking down the front door and the Croats sneaking in the back,' said a Bosnian soldier. Some western diplomats fear that the failure of the international community to stop the bloodshed in Bosnia has emboldened Serb and Croat nationalists to make their land grab in Bosnia. 'The Croat and Serb share a common contempt for Moslems and plan to carve up Bosnia-Hercegovina,' says one. Mr Jadranko Prlic, acting prime minister of the self-styled Croat state, claims 'Moslems expected too much of Croats', smallest of Bosnia's three main ethnic groups. 'Who can expect Croats, who make up just 17 per cent of the population, can deliver a free Bosnia-Hercegovina to the Moslems?' he asks. Serb forces from the surrounding hills last year bombarded the now blackened town in which most buildings in the old Turkish centre have been razed. Bosnian forces, backed by Croat troops, drove Serb fighters out in June. 'In a few days there will be a war between the HVO and the Bosnian army,' said an electrician, a Croat who, fearing reprisal, spoke on condition of anonymity. Like many, he described the war in Bosnia as a rural-urban conflict. 'I am going to fight with the Bosnian army. This is my city and I have nowhere else to go. The Croats want to rule Mostar, but they have the villages in the hills,' he said.</p>

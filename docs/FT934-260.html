The 10-member panel would also examine the accounts of state-owned NNPC, which oversees Nigeria's oil industry and has been rocked by fraud allegations. The corporation supervises the export of more than 1.5m barrels of oil a day, earning about Dollars 10bn a year and accounting for more than 90 per cent of Nigeria's foreign exchange income. Nigerian newspapers have recently given prominence to a World Bank report which said Dollars 2.1bn of oil revenue in 1990, when the Gulf crisis boosted oil prices, was unaccounted for by the military government then in power.</p>

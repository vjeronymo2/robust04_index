			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Motoring: Diesels for sensible ecologists A HARDY annual among letters from readers goes something like this: 'I am retiring soon and have to face life without a company car. As a private motorist paying his own bills, I want to take advantage of a diesel car's economy and reliability - but I hate the thought of going back to manual transmission after years of driving automatics. Are there any two-pedal diesels I could afford? My answer is always yes - but with reservations. There can be no argument that diesel cars save ever-more-expensive fuel and are friendly to the environment. And that automatic transmission is far better than a manual gearbox if most of your driving is in town or heavy traffic. So, in many ways a two-pedal diesel is the ideal car for the 1990s. The trouble is there are not many of them about. Diesel cars are taking close to 12 per cent of the UK market and there are nearly 150 saloons, hatchbacks and estate cars from which to choose. But fewer than 20 of them are available as automatics. Mercedes-Benz has always set a good example. Ten years ago, when only one British buyer in 100 chose a diesel car, every one sold by Mercedes was offered with an automatic transmission option. They still are. On the 190D and 250D models, it costs just over Pounds 1,000 extra, but the 300D saloon and 300TD estate have it as standard. It is a pity so few two-pedal models are available because automatic transmission is an ideal partner for a diesel engine of adequate capacity and performance. Development over the years has made diesels with manual gearboxes as easy to drive smoothly as petrol-engined cars. Virtually gone are the rather wooden response to pressure on the accelerator, and the need for care to avoid jerkiness during low-speed traffic driving. gone. But interposing the hydraulic torque converter of an automatic transmission between engine and drive wheels completes the cure. So why are car-makers reluctant to offer two-pedal diesels? There are two reasons: price, and reduced performance. Normally, but not always, a diesel car has a higher list price than its petrol-engined equivalent. Automatic transmissions cost more to make than manual gearboxes. Barring Mercedes, most diesel car manufacturers seem to feel that a combination of the two would price their vehicles out of the market. Fortunately for those who cannot afford a Mercedes, Citroen also thinks otherwise. Buyers of its ZX Avantage and Aura can have the PSA Group's renowned 1.9-litre XU diesel engine, combined with automatic transmission, at strictly affordable prices. The Avantage costs Pounds 11,072 against Pounds 11,909 for the power-steered and better-equipped Aura. Both have remote-controlled central locking, electric front windows and sun roof, and a stereo that should put off thieves because the only car it will fit is another ZX. I found the Aura diesel most likeable. The four-speed automatic changes up ultra-smoothly when accelerating. On slowing down for 30-35 mph (48-56 kmh) bends, the transmission's shift into third for a quick pick-up is only just detectable. Automatics do absorb some power. The two-pedal ZX diesel is not quite as quick off the mark as its manual version. Its top speed is said to be slightly lower and the fuel consumption perhaps 5-7 per cent higher, although much depends on how you drive it. For many motorists, though, the gains in convenience and driving relaxation are well worth it. They certainly would be for me. As a two-pedal ZX diesel will give a sensible driver 45 mpg (6.27 l/100km) in average use, it must be rated economical as well as agreeable personal transport. The Citroen BX19TGD, one size up, also is offered with the same engine and transmission as the two-pedal diesel ZX at Pounds 12,563. The biggest Citroen diesel, the XM td is a lovely car with a five-speed gearbox and can be incredibly economical; mine gave me 44-45 mpg (6.42-6.27 1/100 km) regularly on a journey. But the automatic version (from Pounds 18,810) is better. Although a little thirstier, it is more refined at low speeds. Having only two pedals makes the foot-operated parking brake acceptable. Not being blessed with three feet, I never got used to its awkwardness in the XM manual. Peugeot's 605 has the same punchy, 2.1-litre, 12-valve turbo-diesel as the XM and this, too, is twice the car with automatic transmission. It costs from Pounds 20,259. The Mercedes-Benz 190D 2.5 I am driving now is, for me, almost the perfect car. It is exactly the right size, has an enormous boot, is air-conditioned and built like a bank vault. No other diesels can match the urbanity of a Mercedes. The 190D 2.5's five-cylinder engine, cocooned in sound-damping material, fires up first thing with no more than a chuckle and is barely audible at tick-over. Having no turbo-charger, its acceleration is hardly kick-in-the-back, but it cruises on the Autobahn at 100 mph (161 kph) with no more fuss than it does at 70 mph (113 kmh) or thereabouts on a British motorway. Consumption is around 32-38 mpg (8.82-7.43 l/100 km). The main snag with a Mercedes diesel is high initial cost. An automatic 190D 2.5 is listed at Pounds 21,393 but, on the road with air-conditioning and a few other goodies, it is nearer Pounds 25,000. The pleasant, if leisurely, two-litre 190D automatic is Pounds 18,343, although the price is more likely to be more than Pounds 19,000 key-in-hand. Volvo's 940 turbo-diesel automatic - apart from the Mercedes 300D, the only six-cylinder diesel car sold in Britain - costs Pounds 21,050. It is a quiet, smooth drive. If you have the money, the best diesel car of all is the Mercedes-Benz 300D with standard automatic transmission. It is listed at Pounds 25,270 although the bottom line will be more like Pounds 29,000 with air-conditioning and a few extras, But when you sell it some years and 100,000 miles later, still running like new, it will have lost a smaller proportion of its original value than almost any other car. A diesel Rover Metro (this column, last week) with CVT, a simple but most effective form of automatic transmission, is a thought to conjure with. It could be a lovely little car but the price would probably deter most potential buyers. Further up-market, BMW will at last be bringing its excellent six-cylinder turbo-diesels to Britain by the end of this year. I have been saying it for years and now a lot of people seem to be agreeing with me. Diesels really are the cars for sensible drivers who want to pay more than lip service to protecting the environment.</p>

			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / Insurance sales manager sacked General Portfolio, the insurance company, sacked one of its sales managers on Friday for a serious breach of training practices. The company, which has 67 branches in the UK and contracts with 1,600 sales agents, has also suspended two other managers in its direct-sales branch at Farnborough, Hampshire, while it considers their 'suitability to carry out their responsibilities'. The sacking offence occurred towards the end of last year. These actions follow an investigation into allegations that managers at the branch did not follow training procedures for new sales agents. The manager was fired for falsifying sales-agent training records. Lautro, the life industry's self-regulating body, stipulates that managers must keep records of observations made during meetings between new sales agents and potential clients. The company specifies that managers must keep records of four such meetings. The company found that one manager had completed records 'confirming his presence at a meeting between a company representative and the client despite not being present'. Former sales agents also alleged that managers encouraged them to use unauthorised competition entry forms offering potential customers prizes to tempt them to buying products. The company's investigation comes in the midst of controversy surrounding the sale of personal-investment products, particularly pensions. In recent months Lautro has fined several companies for breaching industry standards. Mr Paul Smith and Mr Richard Hannan, two former sales agents, also alleged that before a compliance office visit in December, a memo was sent out ordering consultants to destroy all 'unauthorised' competition entry forms. They also said they were only aware of one of the advertised prize draws taking place. General Portfolio said its head office had approved three of the competition entry forms and that the remaining unauthorised forms were destroyed on the request of the company's compliance office. The company said it had no evidence that breaches in the Farnborough branch were 'anything other than an isolated incident'.</p>

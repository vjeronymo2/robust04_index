			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Top-level Slovene-Croat talks have been held in  the Presidential Palace in Zagreb. The presidents of the two  countries, Franjo Tudjman and his guest Milan Kucan, who arrived  this morning for a working visit to Croatia, made brief  statements following their talks. The Slovene president's visit  to Zagreb is being covered by Andjelko Perincic:    [Perincic] Speaking to the press, President Kucan described  the talks as tough, polemic, and open but imbued with mutual  understanding nevertheless.    [Begin Kucan recording, in Slovene with superimposed  Serbo-Croatian translation] I believe, as the talks  demonstrated, that unilateral solutions do not facilitate mutual  understanding and the development of mutual trust between the  two countries. The talks were held under different  circumstances from those surrounding the process of securing  Slovene and Croatian independence when there were intense  contacts. [end recording]    Kucan also said life demands solutions to problems and the  establishment of new political relations can be endorsed only by  concrete steps. Croatian President Franjo Tudjman also spoke to  the press.    [Begin Tudjman recording] Many international factors prompt  both Croatia and Slovenia to coordinate their policies. The  rise of neofascist claims in today's Italy against Slovene and  Croatian territory explicitly point to this. Understandably, we  hope the Italian Government will continue the democratic  policies pursued by the previous governments and the policy of  friendly relations with our countries. At the same time we must  not ignore those forces that are openly extolling fascism,  including everything this fascism brought about on the soil of  Slovenia and Croatia.

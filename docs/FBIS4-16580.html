			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yevgeniy Vyatkin, candidate of technical </F> sciences: "So That We Would Not Need Bast Sandals..."]    [Text] In the author's opinion, we have to seriously  prepare ourselves for unemployment in the coal industry.    "The Coal Industry Is in Its Death Throes," was the sad  title  of M. Yermakov's article, published in DONBASS on 5 January  1994. It describes disproportions in the prices for coal and  materials needed for its production. That the miners'  dissatisfaction with wages, shortage of materials and spare  parts results in both a lower coal production and a lack of  discipline, sloppiness. That mines need subsidies, without which  they will not survive. But at the same time, says the author, we  need to increase labor productivity and cut the labor force.    The question of needing to cut the labor force is not new.  It  is also linked with another issue--closing the mines with poor  production indicators. However, no cardinal measures have yet  been taken in this direction. Year by year, this changes for the  worse the indicators of the sector's overall operation. The past  year of 1993 is not an exception--production of coal and labor  productivity fell by more than 13 percent, while the size of the  labor force remained practically unchanged. The situation is  more or less the same at Donetsk Oblast mines. Many money-losing  mines were still in operation thanks to financial and credit  propping by the state. This made it possible to support a great  number of jobs in order to avoid unemployment. But it also  contributed to unprecedented inflation in the country. It can no  longer continue this way.    Today inefficient mines cannot count on large-scale help on  the part of the state. There is one way to survive--mobilization  of internal reserves. But not all reserves can be used by mines  without state support. Some subsidies will be needed. A subsidy  is the state sharing in the coal producers' expenses. The  state's share depends on its capabilities and the need for coal.  At the same time, coal producers must ensure the required volume  and production cost.    Great Britain's experience is interesting in this respect:  It  carried out a program of closing unprofitable mines soon after  the notorious strike of British miners. The state there set a  maximum for production costs the mines could achieve. If that  value was exceeded, the mine was closed. Over a four-year  period, while maintaining the same total level of coal  production, 60 mines in the country were closed, with a  40-percent labor force reduction.    Ukraine's Gosugleprom began a similar undertaking.  Twenty-one  mines with low technical and economic indicators have been  selected (including 12 in Donetsk Oblast), and for them targets  have been set for 1994 requiring an increase in labor  productivity and reduction in production cost. If it turns out  that it is impossible to improve the situation by the means  available, the mines will be closed. It is clear that other  mines will follow in the footsteps of this first group.    It is clear that the road to better productivity and  production cost indicators lies through ensuring effective  employment for the population. The process of improving  employment includes freeing workers, redistributing them among  spheres of employment, existence of unemployment, ensuring high  labor productivity, and remuneration by results of labor. Many  people found themselves unprepared for this process, which by  itself is not unexpected for the industry. First and foremost  unprepared for an understanding that production should employ as  many workers as it needs, not as many as there are available. In  practice, it manifested itself in such associations as  Artemugol, Dzerzhinskugol, and Ordzhonikidzeugol, where the size  of the labor force practically has not changed since 1992, while  the output of coal fell by 20-24 percent. It is obvious that  when production declines, it is logical to let some workers go.  If a decline is temporary, it is a temporary lay-off. The heart  of the solution to employment problem is creating a core of  skilled and productive workers at enterprises (associations).  The size of the remaining labor force must change on the basis  of production needs.    There are many ways to provide employment for persons  released from primary production. In particular, there is the  known practice of creating auxiliary enterprises. Donetskugol  association has experience in this respect. There are  enterprises in its system that make sausage and furniture, churn  butter, and manufacture equipment. Yu. Seregin wrote about it in  the article "Will Donetskugol-lapti-selkhoz-prom Save Us If the  Mines Are Closed?" (DONBASS, 13 November 1993). Actually, the  association does not yet make lapti [bast sandals]. But there is  no doubt that the approach taken by the association, which may  include different solutions, will help the miners to weather  transition years. And the society as a whole will benefit from  it, since people will be paid wages for the results of their  labor instead of "pay" for idling during the periods of decline  and cutbacks in the primary production.    There is also another important ask--we need to break the  dependency psychology of some collectives. As is known, when our  miners insist on their demands, they are inclined to point out  the income of American miners. But one has to look at himself  with a critical eye and ask himself why labor productivity of  five to 10 tonnes a month has become so common? This is several  times less than the level reached by Ukraine in the past and  tens of times less than the yield produced by American coal  miners. So at whose expense do  the collectives with poor labor results intend to live?    Growth of labor productivity in the sector as a whole is  hampered by shortcomings in the development of the mine  inventory. The oblast currently has many small mines: 67 percent  of the mines have the production capacity of less than 60,000  tonnes a month, and 22 percent have less than 300,000 tonnes a  month. Other countries have long disposed of such things. So  perhaps we should now speed up the closing or denationalization  of small mines? This will allow to use of materials and labor  resources more effectively. The capacities being taken off line  may be compensated for by increasing the rate of utilization of  capacities of remaining enterprises. There are reserves in this  respect, since last year in the oblast on average capacities  were being utilized at a 77-percent rate, and in almost  one-third of the mines, at less than 60 percent.    And, finally, the measures for reanimation of the coal  industry will be successful only when the workers  unconditionally accept the rule that "there should be discipline  at work!" and wages are commensurate only with the results. This  should reinforce workers' understanding that this is no longer  the time when, as Nikolay Ivanovich Bukharin said: "From a hired  slave, the proletariat of our country became a hegemon." These  days all of us must first and foremost become civilized hired  labor, and in addition, we may become co-owners of enterprises.  The more we persist in not understanding it, the worse it will  be for us, and the more realistic the prospect that we will  indeed need bast sandals...</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A survey conducted by the Japan External Trade  Organization [JETRO] on manufacturers with overseas operation  bases has shown that most of the companies surveyed plan to  increase "imports back" into Japan of products from their  operations overseas. About one-fourth of the companies  expressed concern about hollowing out of the domestic industry.  The survey was conducted in October by sending out  questionnaires to 571 manufacturing companies which have  production bases overseas. A total of 219 companies have  responded to the questionnaires.    The companies which said "we will expand overseas production  in the next five years" ran to 90.1 percent of the respondents.  Five years ago, 6.7 percent of the companies answered "our  overseas production exceeds our domestic production," but the  recent survey shows 8.5 percent of the companies as having  produced more overseas than at home, and the survey predicts the  percentage of these companies to grow to 20.3 percent in five  years from now.    Moreover, while only 41.7 percent said "we will raise  exports  in five years from now," 67.8 percent said "we will raise  `imports back' from their production bases overseas." According  to the survey, the companies which will "import back" from  overseas will grow to 75.1 percent in five years from now.    Regarding the danger of "industrial hollowing out" that can  bring reduction in the domestic production and employment as  well as lowering of capabiliites for technological development,  65.3 percent answered, "there is such a danger, but we think we  can avoid that situation by taking appropriate actions," while  25.3 percent replied "we see that danger well enough" and 8.9  percent said "we do not foresee that danger at all."</p>

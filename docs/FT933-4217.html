			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Survey of World Car Industry (6): British carmaker bucks the trend - Rover THE Rover Group has achieved a rare distinction this year. It is the only sizeable car maker to have increased unit sales in continental Europe's tumbling car markets. Its European sales rose by 10.5 per cent to 191,000 in the first seven months in the face of a nearly 18 per cent decline in the market overall. Rover's market share has increased from 2 to 2.7 per cent. It has largely succeeded in transforming its image from an essentially failed UK state-owned leviathan to a relatively small but flexible and competent producer of cars perceived to be a cut above their mass-market rivals. And five years after buying it - as BL - for Pounds 150m from the government, the parent company, British Aerospace became free to sell it on August 12. With production of 405,000 cars and Land Rover, Range Rover and Discovery four-wheel-drive vehicles last year, Rover is a minor but nevertheless important player in the European market. It remains, by a small margin, the UK's biggest carmaker, although it takes second place to Ford as a vehicle maker if light commercial vehicles are included. Its chairman, Mr George Simpson, has depicted a future for Rover in which it can be a viable, independent producer of around 500,000 vehicles a year; earning enough not just to satisfy shareholders, but to make the daunting ongoing investments required of any car maker to renew model ranges. Even if, as some industry analysts such as Prof Garel Rhys of Cardiff Business School's Motor Industry Research Centre indicate, Rover should need higher volumes, it has the capacity to achieve them. Rover's car plants at Longbridge near Birmingham and Cowley, Oxfordshire, with Land Rover's Solihull facility could virtually double current production with little investment and maximum multi-shift working. Perhaps most important, it has had by far the longest and most intimate relationship of any European manufacturer with the Japanese industry which its rivals have come so much to fear. Rover began building Honda's Ballade (under licence, as the Triumph Acclaim), in 1980. Subsequently, through joint car development programmes such as the Rover 800/Honda Legend executive cars; the smaller Rover 200/Honda Concerto and the just-launched Rover 600/Honda Accord, Rover has assimilated to good effect much of the working culture, practices and manufacturing systems which have served Japanese car makers so well in their forays into overseas markets. Honda, now making its own cars at Swindon, has itself benefited from Rover's vehicle design expertise and there is a 20 per cent cross shareholding between Rover and Honda's UK manufacturing subsidiary. It was little wonder, then, then that Volkswagen, in its dash to become European market leader by acquisition (SEAT and Skoda), was tipped as a leading candidate to buy Rover when the UK government's strings attached to BAe ownership were finally snipped - and after it became clear that Honda itself had no ambitions to acquire control. Other leading manufacturers such as Ford were also assumed to be potential bidders, given what was a widespread assumption that BAe would seek an almost immediate sale, for Pounds 450-Pounds 500m, and concentrate once more on its core aerospace business. The assumption appears to have been wrong. Not only is BAe showing no immediate desire to sell; with defence and other parts off the aerospace industry going off the boil, there are signs that Rover is itself coming to be regarded as a core business. Nor is the current depressed European motor industry climate, particularly in Germany, conducive to acquisitions. There is speculation about possible management buy-out proposals. But whether in BAe or managers' hands, 'the best result could well be that Rover remains the industrial equivalent of Belgium,' observes Prof Rhys. The Rover 200/400 has already re-established Rover as a serious competitor in the lower-medium car sector. Following a Pounds 200m investment to transform production facilities at Cowley, the Rover 800 has become a market leader in the UK executive car sector. The fact that the Rover 600 is regularly matched against BMW by the motoring media provides further evidence that Rover's 'upmarket' strategy is working. A new entity, the Special Projects Division, has been formed to exploit market niches offering the prospect of high margins for relatively low investment. Cabriolet and Cooper versions of the evergreen Mini and the MG RV8 sports car are just among the first of a rash of such products over the next few years. Production of Discovery and Range Rover models has been raised repeatedly and Rover expects to quadruple sales of these vehicles, to 16,000 units annually, in the US alone by the mid-1990s. Meanwhile, it is indicative of the new flexibility of both production processes and Rover's 33,000 strong work force that the Cowley plant, in which Rover has invested more than Pounds 200m since 1990, is viably building, in small batches away from the main production lines, the ageing Montego and Maestro models. Mr John Towers, Rover's managing director, makes clear that it will continue to do so for as long as demand for even a few thousand a year persists. Inevitably, however, Rover's early heavy dependence on Honda, its extensive use of Honda engines and the Japanese maker's essentially leading role in joint car development to date has led industry observers to question whether Rover any longer has the technological as well as financial resources to stand alone. Mr Towers grins. Across Rover's product range, he points out, a full-line product engineering capability can still be found. The Rover 200 coupe's body shell is Rover's own, albeit on an essentially Honda platform. The widely acclaimed K series engine owes nothing to Honda, and is being developed from the current 1.1 and 1.4 litre versions into 1.6 litre and V6 units which will eventually displace Honda's engine in the 200/400 and 800 ranges. Basically what the world has not so far seen is the resurgent Rover's full technology capability brought together into one new model, he teases - but the world may not have many years to wait. While Rover remains notoriously tight-lipped about new product plans, it plans to re-enter the sports car market with a K Series-engined MG, code-named PR3, in 1995. This, however, is to be a joint venture with Mayflower Corporation, the specialist UK engineering company, which is being contracted to design, develop and supply the body shell. A wholly Rover vehicle is much more likely to be a replacement for the Metro, on which Rover is currently working. A question mark remains, however, over finance. Mr Towers says Rover now is close to its target of financial break-even at 400,000 cars a year, after making startling productivity improvements - a claimed 18 per cent at Cowley so far this year - and the result of stringent cost cutting. Analysts expect Rover to achieve a trading profit, before interest, of Pounds 30-50m this year. But with current debts of around Pounds 400m Rover would still be making a net loss. And this year's trading profit will follow two consecutive years of operating losses - Pounds 49m in 1992 and Pounds 52m in 1991.( There was a trading profit of Pounds 65m in 1990). Mr Towers insists that it will take only a relatively modest upswing in markets for the benefits of efficiency measures to show through. Analysts tend to agree. Many expect profits, at least at the trading level, to more than double in 1994, to Pounds 90m-Pounds 100m.</p>

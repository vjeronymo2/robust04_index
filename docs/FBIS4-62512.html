			<p>BFN     [Text] Yerevan, 16 May (SNARK)--A meeting of CSCE's Minsk  Group representative Ian Eliasson and Russian President's  Special Envoy Vladimir Kazimirov with the leaders of  Nagorno-Karabakh was held in Yerevan. The meeting was  transferred there from Stepanakert, where it was supposed to be,  at the request of the CSCE and RF [as received] representatives.  The reason was the bad weather that did not allow them to visit  the capital of Nagorno-Karabakh.    As acting Nagorno-Karabakh Supreme Soviet Chairman Karen  Baburyan told SNARK, the sides agreed that it was necessary to  combine CSCE's and Russia's intermediary efforts in order to  obtain stable and guaranteed truce. The latter will be the  cornerstone of the further gradual settlement of all the  problems connected with Nagorno-Karabakh. The Karabakh side,  represented by the Supreme Soviet Chairman, as well as the  Chairman of Karabakh State Committee for Defence Robert  Kocharyan, and Foreign Affairs Minister Arkadiy Gukasyan, put  forward their proposals.    "I consider this meeting to be positive, at least because  the  representative of Russia came to Karabakh together with the  Minsk Group representative," said, in particular, Karen  Baburyan. In his words, this fact testifies to the tendency of  combining the efforts of CSCE and Russia in the way of peaceful  settlement of the conflict.</p>

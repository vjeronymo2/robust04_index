			<p><P> October 6, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> IF JACK CLARK RETURNS, AT LEAST ONE FAN WON'T  </P> <P> I would have been better off reading the front page headlines first instead of  sports Saturday morning -- depressing as they are.  </P> <P> What a way to start the day. "Clark Blames Gwynn for Everything," "Me and him  don't get along anyway. We never have." Me and him . . . me and him. What  revealing syntax!  </P> <P> This 36-year-old, semi-literate bigmouth criticizes Gwynn for being a selfish  player only weeks after publicly castigating his employer for offering him an  "insulting" $2.5 million in 1991!  </P> <P> Well, I've had it. If crude, cantankerous Clark is still on the roster next  spring, there'll be no San Diego baseball for me.  </P> <P> DONALD S. MUSICKANT, San Diego  </P></p>

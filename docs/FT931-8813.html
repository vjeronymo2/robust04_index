			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Jobs: The real lessons of 'Yes, Minister' - Denmark's premier is not the only Scandinavian to take Machiavellian manoeuvres seriously 'YOU wouldn't expect a managerial revolution to start in Scandinavia, but this could be it,' the Jobs column remarked to its partner Bill Hall. He just went on tapping his keyboard and peering at his screen. But I wasn't to be deterred. 'You've surely seen the story about Denmark's new premier training his cabinet by making them read Yes, Minister scripts?' I persisted . . . and seemingly got through. 'Printed it two weeks back,' said Bill, best known for his Observer column on the FT's centre pages, then he added with scarcely a pause: 'What I want to know is why your announcement says your chief executive left amicably when the buzz is he's taken the cash reserves with him, not to mention the chairman's wife' - or some such words, which took me aback until I saw what had happened. In the brief interval, he had put on his telephone headset and begun talking over his tapping to someone else afar off. His feat at first reminded me of the northern machinist's retort when work-study experts ordered him to operate with both hands at once: 'Aye, and if you stick yon broom-handle up my backside, I'll sweep t'floor as well.' My second thought was to give up the struggle of internal communications and beg the ears of you readers instead. After all, it's external communications that are the nub of the managerial revolution which Scandinavian developments might spark. While it is admittedly hard to credit that a Dane would take lessons from a Swede, such would appear to have occurred. For the Danish Social Democrat premier Poul Nyrup Rasmussen is not the first Nordic eminence to twig that the Yes, Minister television series - whose manipulations of elected leaders by cunning bureaucrats are usually just laughed at as satirical comedy - is underpinned by something serious indeed. The same fact was seen beforehand by Sweden's Nils Brunsson, professor of management at the Stockholm School of Economics. What awakened him to the point, though, was not just watching the telly, but the findings of rigorous research. Accordingly, while he would agree that top bosses can learn much from Yes, Minister scripts, he'd go farther. In his view, the dangers of being manipulated from below are such that it takes exceptional humility as well as intelligence on the bosses' part to pick out the right lessons, even though they are noted in his book The Organisation of Hypocrisy*, discussed in this corner of the FT in September 1991. For the benefit of readers not around then, however, I'd better repeat that he thinks the said dangers are rooted in the growing need for the heads of companies, let alone countries, to pay heed to external communications. And oddly enough, an illustration arose the other day when partner Hall kindly invited me to a post-toil hobnob with colleagues who cover stock market events. During the chat, up came the Queens Moat company which, several of us agreed, is certainly no less good than the rival group Forte when it comes to managing hotels. So why, someone asked, have Queens Moat's shares failed *John Wiley, Pounds 17.95. to stand up on the market as well as those of its bigger competitor. One reason put forward was that, in contrast to Queens Moat, Forte puts much high-level energy into its relations with investment interests, not least in gently preparing them for glitches. Even so, keeping the share market sweet is merely a small part of the multiplying demand on companies of appreciable size to woo the approval of influential outsiders. Others include a welter of variegated pressure groups together with local, national and yea supranational bureaucracies such as the European Community. Hence, Professor Brunsson says, jollying along influence-wielders is increasingly becoming a full-time job which, of its nature, must largely be done by high-ranked people. Moreover, besides being potentially at least as decisive, the work involved in external communications differs from that of internally managing an organisation. Dealing successfully with the outside bodies mainly falls into the realm of politics, which means that upper-rank jobs call more and more for political skills in handling the mechanics of human interests, ambitions and alliances, and the multitudinous concatenations of same. Although political skills are also useful in managing internally, it takes a markedly different ability to handle the mechanics of making, marketing and delivering goods and services which people will think it worthwhile to buy. The result is a division of skills between the externally focused top tiers of management and the internally centred ranks lower down. True, by comparison with heads of government, chiefs of companies are usually more closely acquainted with what they're supposed to run. But thanks to fast changing technologies and markets, they are hard-pressed to keep up with developments in the methods by which their outfit's living is earned. Nils Brunsson therefore argues that the division of skills is likely to widen, with the chiefs of large organisations ever less capable of knowing what can, let alone what should be done below. The dilemma is that the selfsame chiefs are viewed as responsible for said doings by the equally decisive external interests. So what, if anything, can be done about it? Where answers are concerned, the Jobs column's suspicion is that the Swedish professor will part company with the Danish premier. For it looks as though Mr Rasmussen's aim in making his colleagues study Yes, Minister scripts is that they'll thereby become knowledgeable enough about Machiavellian mandarins' tactics to outsmart them at their own games, so ensuring they do the government's bidding. Alas it is an aim which, in Nils Brunsson's view, is doomed to fail. In any complex organisation, he says, it's as good as impossible for people whose jobs depend on fostering external relations to gain sufficient knowledge of internal realities simply to impose their will on the more technically expert staff below. So chiefs of that sort do better to accept their limitations . . . which is where the need for humility as well as intelligence comes in. Certainly such chiefs must take decisions - that's what the outside stake-holders see as their job. But chiefs should recognise that what they decide will not necessarily or even usually be put into effect, and still more so that attempts to force strict obedience are apt to spawn damaging resistance. After all, their best ally in their external dealings is a set of technically expert supporters concentrating on keeping the organisation doing what it's best at. So the chiefs should ensure the decisions they take are supportive of that same end. One example Professor Brunsson cites is decisions to do something already being done. Most importantly, externally focused chiefs should never become involved in the detailed implementation of what they decide, and still less show their approval or the opposite by rewarding or punishing those held responsible. The reason is that, if they do, their most expert underlings will stop concentrating on productive work and start playing internal politics.</p>

			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME PROTECTION  </P> <P> It was fine that Stephen J. Frazier of San Diego wrote to correct an error on  the river that flows through his home state of Vermont (Letters, Sept. 10), but  why did he have to add the last sentence: "I only hope you didn't encourage too  many of them to visit"?  </P> <P> If he is so protective of his home state, why isn't he back there protecting it  instead of being in San Diego taking advantage of its opportunities? Did  California discourage him from visiting or moving in? Isn't there enough room  in the United States for each of us to find our own chosen visiting or living  space?  </P> <P> VICKIE L. SPRATT  </P> <P> Pomona  </P></p>

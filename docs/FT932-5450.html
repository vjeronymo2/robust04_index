			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Forecast improves for Australian wheat THE AUSTRALIAN wheat crop will be 14.58m tonnes in the year ending March 1994, according to the latest prediction by Australian Wheat Forecasters, a private forecasting agency, Reuter reports from Melbourne. AWF's new figure is up from the 13.83m tonnes it estimated last month but still well below 1992-93's harvest of 15.33m tonnes. 'Over the past month the main development has been the frequent and heavy rains that have fallen in Western Australia,' the agency said, adding that a series of four periods of rain since April had allowed growers to prepare fields and sow seed grain in Australia's biggest wheat producing state.</p>

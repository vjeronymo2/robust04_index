			<p><P> May 14, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> BASKETBALL COACH ARRESTED  </P> <P> Maryland basketball Coach Gary Williams was arrested and charged with drunk  driving, further adding to the problems of a basketball program that is still  reeling from harsh NCAA sanctions.  </P> <P> Maryland State Police spokesman Edwin Lashley said Williams was stopped on the  Capital Beltway about 1:50 a.m. Saturday after a trooper noticed his car  weaving among traffic lanes.  </P> <P> Trooper Christopher Sasse followed Williams for about a mile before stopping  him, Lashley said.  </P> <P> Williams, 45, failed a roadside sobriety test and another test given at the  Rockville barracks, Washington television station WUSA-TV reported Sunday. In  Maryland, the standard for driving while intoxicated is a blood-alcohol level  of at least .10.  </P> <P> Williams guided Maryland to a 19-14 record in his first season. The school is  appealing a three-year probation by the NCAA for recruiting violations under  former Coach Bob Wade. The sanctions include a ban on postseason play for the  next two years, causing several players to announce their intention to  transfer.  </P></p>

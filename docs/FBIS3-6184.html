Lee, in an interview with the Japanese daily MAINICHI  SHIMBUN, said, "theoretically, realization of the special envoy  exchange is possible before March 21, but it is nothing more  than our (South Korea's) wishful thinking. Actually, we have  little time. It is difficult."    Yi added that since Washington agreed with Seoul not to hold  the talks unless the special envoy exchange is realized, the  scheduled third round of high-level talks between Pyongyang and  Washington seems impossible either.    In one promising development, North Korea virtually withdrew  four preconditions for the envoy exchange including "suspension  of the nuclear military exercise" at an inter-Korean  working-level contact last Saturday.    "With North Korea's change of attitude, although the special  envoys may not be exchanged before March 21, a final agreement  on the exchange may be reached by that date," he said.    South Korea will press the envoy exchange because it is part  of preparatory work for an inter-Korean summit meeting, Yi  emphasized.    Yi said North Korea had admitted its economic failure,  adding  that Pyongyang seemed to be re-evaluating its announced  withdrawal from the nuclear nonproliferation treaty (NPT).</p>

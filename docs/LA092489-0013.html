			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CLASSICS ON CASSETTE: THE SOUNDS OF THE JAZZ AGE  </P> <P> All those lovely images in "The Great Gatsby" came flowing out of my cassette  player, but what moved me, what made me hit the rewind button, was something  more ordinary.  </P> <P> A schedule.  </P> <P> "Rise from bed, 6 a.m. Dumbbell exercise and wall scaling, 6:15-6:30 a.m. Study  electricity, etc: 7:15-8:15 a.m. Work, 8:30-4:30 p.m. . . . Practice elocution,  poise and how to attain it, 5:00-6:00 p.m. . . . Read one improving book or  magazine per week."  </P> <P> As you may recall, that was the regimen followed by the modestly born Jimmy  Gatz of North Dakota, who made himself into one of the great inventions of the  Jazz Age, Jay Gatsby.  </P> <P> Nothing in this, F. Scott Fitzgerald's greatest work, is more poignant than the  moment when Gatsby's father reveals the self-improvement schedule written on  the last fly-leaf of a paperback copy of "Hopalong Cassidy."  </P> <P> "The truth was," wrote Fitzgerald, "that Jay Gatsby of West Egg, Long Island,  sprang from his Platonic conception of himself. He was a son of God -- a phrase  which, if it means anything, means just that -- and he must be about His  Father's business, the service of a vast, vulgar and meretricious beauty. So he  invented just the sort of Jay Gatsby that a 17-year-old boy would be likely to  invent, and to this conception he was faithful to the end."  </P> <P> And when did Gatsby abandon any chance that he might pull it off? When he  kissed Daisy Fay on a magical, moonlit night in Louisville, Ky. Here's  Fitzgerald: "He knew that when he kissed this girl, and forever wed his  unutterable visions to her perishable breath, his mind would never romp again  like the mind of God. So he waited, listening for a moment longer to the tuning  fork that had been struck upon a star. Then he kissed her. At his lips' touch  she blossomed for him like a flower and the incarnation was complete."  </P> <P> Fitzgerald biographer Andrew Turnbull writes that the author was counting on  big sales -- at least 75,000 copies -- for "The Great Gatsby" when it was  published in April, 1925.  </P> <P> By then, Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald were well into their lavish life-style and  were living on the French Riviera partly on the proceeds from the author's  first two books.  </P> <P> (It was also at this time that Fitzgerald wrote Maxwell Perkins, his editor at  Scribner's, and urged him to take a look at a young writer named Ernest  Hemingway. "He's the real thing," wrote Fitzgerald.)  </P> <P> Inexplicably, "The Great Gatsby" sold only 23,000 copies when it came out, and  Fitzgerald was so discouraged he began laying plans to go to Hollywood and  write screenplays.  </P> <P> For the critics, though, "Gatsby" represented major growth for Fitzgerald. T.  S. Eliot wrote the author after reading the new book that ". . . it seems to me  to be the first step that American fiction has taken since Henry James."  </P> <P> Why there are not more recordings of "The Great Gatsby" is a mystery to me.  </P> <P> The only rental I found is offered by Recorded Books. Luckily, it is read by  the incomparable Frank Muller, who adopts a tone for the book's narrator, Nick  Carraway, that perfectly fits Nick's amazement at the outrageous events he  witnessed.  </P> <P> The monthly rental for this unabridged 4 1/2-hour recording is $9.50. For those  building a shelf of recorded classics, the Muller reading can also be purchased  for $21.95.  </P> <P> If you have wanted to own a reading of a modern classic by the legendary  Alexander Scourby, there is also that chance here. Scourby, who died in 1985,  has the rich, cultured voice that Nick Carraway surely would have had in his  later years.  </P> <P> Listening Library sells the Scourby reading to individuals and libraries for  $44.95. G. K. Hall sells it to libraries only. In addition to "The Great  Gatsby," you get five Fitzgerald stories, including "Babylon Revisited" and  "The Lost Decade."  </P> <P> WHERE TO ORDER TAPES:  </P> <P> Recorded Books; 800-638-1304; P.O.

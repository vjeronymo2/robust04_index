			<p><P> November 1, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> WATERS OFF MALTA DISCLOSED AS SITE FOR BUSH-GORBACHEV SUMMIT  </P> <P> Next month's summit at sea between President Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail S.  Gorbachev will take place on U.S. and Soviet warships in waters off Malta, the  White House announced today.  </P> <P> The site designation was said by White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater  to have been made "in accordance with an agreement with Maltese authorities."  </P> <P> Original speculation about the summit site had centered on the waters off  Italy, since Gorbachev will conclude a visit there on Dec. 1. However,  Fitzwater issued a midday announcement pinpointing the waters off Malta as the  site.  </P> <P> Malta is an independent republic in the central Mediterranean consisting of  five islands, two of them uninhabited. It lies 58 miles south of Sicily, 220  miles north of Libya and 180 miles east of Tunisia.  </P></p>

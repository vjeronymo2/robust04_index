			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CHINA FREES 211 HELD FOR ROLES IN DEMOCRACY PROTESTS  </P> <P> China today freed 211 prisoners linked to last year's democracy protests, in  what Western diplomats saw as an attempt to ease tension ahead of the  anniversary of the army's bloody crackdown.  </P> <P> The diplomats also said the release of the prisoners, including several  prominent dissidents, was aimed at boosting China's battered image abroad and  deflecting a campaign to withdraw most-favored-nation trade status by the  United States.  </P> <P> The official New China News Agency said 211 "law breakers" involved in last  year's political unrest had been released.  </P></p>

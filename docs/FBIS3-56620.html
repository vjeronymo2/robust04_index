According to the press center, in the morning of January 14  the Azerbaijani army resumed its offensive after intensive  artillery preparations. It was on the border of Karabakh's  Martuni and Azerbaijan's Fizuli regions that the Karabakh  formations managed to seize several strategic heights on  Thursday [13 January]. As of 15:00 on Thursday hostilities were  continuing in this region. There have been no substantial  changes on other sections of the front over the previous 24  hours.    The day before, supported by three tanks and five armored  vehicles, 250 Azerbaijani infantrymen attacked positions of the  Karabakh army on the section Madagiz-Akop-Kamari in Nagorny  Karabakh's Mardakert region, reports the press center. The  Karabakh forces were a success while inflicting a flank strike  against a concentration of Azerbaijani forces. As a result of a  three hour fight the Azerbaijani detachments appeared encircled,  and 76 Azerbaijani soldiers were killed. According to  preliminary information, the Karabakh party has only 11 soldiers  wounded.    Meanwhile, Azerbaijan's Defense Ministry asserts that the  Armenian but not Azerbaijani formations are waging the  offensive, particularly in Karabakh's north and southeast. All  attempts by the Armenians to counter-attack were fruitless.    The ministry rejected Armenian reports about the seizure of  several villages in the north of Karabakh's Mardakert region by  the Karabakh formations. It pointed out that the village of  Akop-Kamari (its Azerbaijani name - Lyulyasaz) and Madagiz were  under control of Azerbaijan's armed forces.    The ministry also reports that the air defense forces had  been ordered not to bring down Armenian helicopters heading from  the Karabakh village of Gadrut to Armenia despite the fact that  they violate Azerbaijan's air space. Baku believes that wounded  soldiers are being evacuated on these helicopters. The  Azerbaijani Defense Ministry indicated that the number of these  flights had greatly increased over the last time.</p>

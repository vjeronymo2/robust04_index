			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report Zinc hit three-month highs on the LME while nickel closed near eight-month lows. Three month zinc ended kerb trading above Dollars 1,200 a tonne on short covering and talk of a pay strike at a Mexican smelter. Three-month nickel touched an eight-month low of Dollars 7,540 a tonne in the afternoon on trade selling. Talk that Norilsk in Russia has been granted export licences for 20,000 tonnes of metal and can ship 8,000 tonnes out of its own warehouses underlined bearish fundamental sentiment. Lead held near 4 1/2  month highs struck in the morning as speculative interest was attracted by the current upward move. The market is underpinned by talk of secondary metal cuts in the US and impending rationalisation in Europe. Aluminium also advanced, three-month metal moving smartly back above Dollars 1,300 on US short covering against a background of physical demand. Silver futures were ahead at midsession in New York, but gains were limited by Monday's news that Comex warehouse stocks were 1.7m ounces ahead at a record 280,690,354 ounces. That offset a 0.9 per cent rise in US economic leading indicators which pointed to an economic recovery and a possible increase in industrial demand for the metal. Compiled from Reuters</p>

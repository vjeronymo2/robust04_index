			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / International Company News: Dutch insurer ready to launch bid for BBL INTERNATIONALE Nederlanden Group (ING), the big Dutch banking and insurance group, said yesterday it was prepared to launch a bid for Banque Bruxelles Lambert (BBL). The offer would value Belgium's second largest bank at BFr63.6bn (Dollars 2.18bn). The bid would be part of ING's campaign to create a second 'home' market, but the outcome depends to an extent on the attitude of Groupe Bruxelles Lambert, the Belgian holding company which controls 24 per cent of BBL. GBL is reserving judgment on the offer until a formal bid is launched, but Comte Jean-Pierre de Launoit, GBL's deputy chairman and a BBL director, said yesterday: 'The price (BFr3,600 a share) doesn't seem satisfactory.' As a first step, ING, which already owns slightly more than 10 per cent of BBL, is seeking to buy a 6.72 per cent stake held by Unipar and SBH Investments of Italy. If these and other conditions are met, ING said it would launch a bid for the rest of the Belgian bank's shares sometime after mid-October. The offer would be conditional on ING securing at least 51 per cent of BBL's share capital. The two moves could cost ING up to Fl 3.2bn (Dollars 2bn) in cash, to be raised in part by an issue of preference shares. The Banking Commission, Belgium's takeover authority, recommended the Dutch company should launch a full bid if it bought the Italian stake. It is the first time ING has made clear it intends to acquire a majority holding in BBL following months of wrangling between BBL's various institutional shareholders about future alliances. BBL's management favours an international alliance, but others - who may include Mr Albert Frere, GBL's influential chairman - have pressed for links with a Belgian institution, such as Credit Communal. ING's proposals have split the BBL board. At Wednesday's emergency meeting, directors appointed by GBL, Royale Belge and Winterthur - Belgian and Swiss insurance companies - were out-voted when they opposed plans to allow ING to look at the bank's books. They argued it could be dangerous to give the Dutch group access to confidential information, in case it decided not to bid. The board said it would decide whether to support a bid once it had examined the terms of an offer. Under a syndicate deal among BBL's main institutional shareholders, any shares must first be offered to GBL, which has a 15-day right to first refusal. GBL is almost certain to turn down the shares, if it lifts its stake it will be forced to bid for the whole group. Unipar has offered its shares to the syndicate members for BFr3,600 each, against BBL's closing price on Wednesday of BFr3,275.</p>

			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / International Company News: Top Danish insurer back in black at DKr815m Codan, which last year became Denmark's largest general insurance company with the takeover of Hafnia, made a net profit of DKr815m (Dollars 125.4m) in 1993, compared with a DKr74m loss in 1992. Hafnia collapsed in 1992 after an unsuccessful attempt, with Norway's Uni Storebrand, to mount a takeover bid for Skandia, the big Swedish insurance group. Codan is controlled by the UK's Sun Alliance. The Hafnia acquisition is reflected by a rise in Codan's premium income, from DKr2.09bn to DKr6.95bn last year. The figure includes both general insurance and life assurance. The group's total assets rose to DKr55.34bn from DKr15.32bn. Codan said the overall result for 1993 was acceptable, but that the result for general insurance was 'unsatisfactory'. There was a loss on Danish general insurance, before investment income from insurance activities, of DKr770m. However, rising bond and share prices in 1993 pushed up investment income. Investment income on the general insurance business amounted to DKr610m. Other investment income was DKr664m, while the life assurance business made a profit of DKr428m. Codan said performance in general insurance would improve in 1994, as premium prices had been increased and because 1993 was burdened with non-recurring provisions arising from Hafnia. These included DKr400m to cover losses on finance guarantees over and above the amount already set aside by Hafnia. The final result in 1994 will depend on the movement of bond and share prices, said Codan. It is paying an unchanged DKr50-a-share dividend for 1993. RAS, the big Italian insurance group, expects pre-tax profits for last year to exceed the L94.6bn (Dollars 56m) of 1992, writes John Simpkins from Milan.</p>

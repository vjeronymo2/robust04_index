			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 5 (KCNA) -- Today marks the 14th  anniversary of the enforcement of the law on public health in  Korea.    This law adopted at the fourth session of the Sixth Supreme  People's Assembly of the DPRK in April 1980, codifies the  brilliant achievements made in the health care in the country  and gives a theoretical systematization of the principles and  requirements for developing it to a new, higher stage. This day  is significantly commemorated as day of public health every year  in the country.    The DPRK enforced a free medical care system 40 odd years  ago  in the thick of the fatherland liberation war. This complete  and universal free medical care system grants to all people  equal medical benefits. All the costs in health care such as  diagnosis, treatment, surgical operation, hospitalization and  recuperation are free.    In the DPRK where the advanced section doctor system is in  force and preventive medicine is the key point, people are given  enormous benefits through regular check-up, vaccination and  other medical assistance.    Modern people's hospitals have been built in cities and  rural  villages and at industrial establishments and maternity  hospitals, dental preventive hospitals and other specialized  medical care bases are available everywhere.    Several dozen central pharmaceutical factories and thousands  of local pharmaceutical factories in Sunchon, Nanam, Sinuiju and  other parts of the country satisfactorily meet the demand for  medicines.    The state ensures that mineral water resources abundant in  the country are used effectively for the promotion of the  working people's health. Now hundreds of mineral springs are  available in 150 odd areas.    Public health workers have written many valuable scientific  papers while engaging themselves in preventive and curative  services, resulting in marked improvement of medical care.    Thanks to the popular policy of the party and the state and  devoted efforts of the health workers, the average life  expectancy at birth of the population has reached 74.5 years.    The number of the old folks above 90 is on the increase.  Last year it was five times the 1980 figure.</p>

			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / Health company to spend Pounds 41m Smith &amp; Nephew, the healthcare company, is to spend Pounds 41.3m on redeveloping its medical division's Hull site. The project, the largest single capital investment in the company's 138-year history, is intended to increase the division's capacity substantially and upgrade manufacturing facilities to keep pace with increasingly stringent international healthcare regulations. Although Smith &amp; Nephew originated in Hull and has two of its world centres of excellence there, the company considered focusing the investment overseas, which would have led to the gradual rundown of the Hull site where 1,200 are employed. Mr Nick Hildyard, medical division managing director, said the Department of Trade and Industry's offer of a Pounds 2.65m regional selective assistance grant helped 'tip the balance' in Hull's favour. The city has Intermediate Area status, the lower of the two grades on the DTI's regional aid map. Mr Hildyard said Britain, while fighting hard for inward investment, had sometimes not put enough effort into retaining investment by home-grown companies. 'What people have perhaps missed in the hype is the leakage to overseas locations of UK businesses,' he said. The Hull site makes advanced wound-care products, using film, foam and gel technology, and casting and support products for broken and damaged limbs. Mr Hildyard said Smith &amp; Nephew was the world leader - based on market share  -in casting and support and in the top three in wound care. The Hull site's target is 10 per cent a year growth in volume over the next five years through the development of new markets and new products. The company hopes increased sales stemming from the new investment will boost employment at Hull to 1,300 by the year 2000. Construction starts in January. Medical division sales have doubled in the past five years to nearly Pounds 200m. Two-thirds of products made in Hull are exported to more than 120 countries worldwide. Mrs Maureen Foers, president of Hull Chamber of Commerce and Shipping, welcomed the news. She said: 'If Smith &amp; Nephew have the confidence in Hull to make this sort of investment other organisations should look very closely.'</p>

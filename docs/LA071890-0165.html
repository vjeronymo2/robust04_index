			<p><P> July 18, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SIDELINES;  </P> <P> ROONEY LINKED TO BETTING RING  </P> <P> The late Art Rooney, founder of the Pittsburgh Steelers, was described in court  today as a good customer of a man on trial for doing millions of dollars in  bookmaking.  </P> <P> The comment about Rooney came in opening statements at the trial of Paul  Hankish, 58, whom the government said started running a bookmaking operation  out of Bridgeport, Ohio, in 1957.  </P> <P> "One of Hankish's partners . . . will testify that they took out-of-state bets  over the telephone, including wagers from a Pittsburgh-based group headed by  Art Rooney, who they code-named No. 42," U.S. Atty. William A. Kolibash wrote  in a statement released Tuesday.  </P> <P> "No. 42" placed bets with a Mississippi and Texas bookmaker totaling $100,000 a  weekend, the statement said. The statement referred to several No. 42s and it  was unclear whether it referred to Rooney.  </P> <P> Assistant U.S. Atty. John Reed declined to discuss whether Rooney placed bets  on professional football, saying they were not planning to bring any witnesses  who would discuss Rooney's alleged betting habits.  </P> <P> Rooney died in 1988 at age 87 after a stroke.  </P></p>

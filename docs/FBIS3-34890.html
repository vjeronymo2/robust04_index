Our correspondent Hayim Hecht reports that Peres  was responding to queries by several Knesset members claiming  that the arrangements on the border crossings would allow the  Palestinians to carry out the right of return. Peres said that  if the Palestinian leadership violates the agreements Israel  will implement sanctions, including summarily preventing  Palestinian entrance by resorting to the right of veto Israel  was given in the agreement.    The foreign minister said that last year approximately  300,000 Palestinians entered the territories for summer visits.  He admitted that supervision of their exit at the end of their  visits is not perfect.</p>

			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / Leading Article: A sceptical Bank THE BANK of England's new freedom to publish a quarterly and critical commentary on the Treasury's economic policy and performance is a valuable and thoroughly un-British innovation. The underlying message of yesterday's inflation report seems to be that the government has not yet done enough to convince either the financial markets, or the Bank, that it will meet its medium-term inflation targets. But its rather elliptical style still makes it a challenge to discern what the Bank really thinks. In the short-term, the clear message of the Bank's report is that inflationary pressures are not a pressing problem for UK economic management. Despite nascent recovery and falling unemployment, there is still plenty of disinflation left in the system. Monetary growth remains sluggish, employment is falling and wage inflation and settlements are subdued. Lower unit labour costs have offset the recent rise in import prices. The Bank's central projection is that underlying inflation will remain within the government's 1-4 per cent target range over the next two years. It thus clears the way for a further cut in short-term interest rates this autumn. Assuming that the government's popularity remains low, and the recovery remains weak and patchy, such a rate cut is likely to be as politically necessary as it is economically sensible. But the inflation report provides a powerful counterweight to the idea that the recent bond market rally implies that the medium-term inflation threat has also disappeared. The rally in long-term government bonds has reduced nominal yields on gilts by around a percentage point since May but also knocked a quarter point off index-linked gilt yields. Expected inflation over the next decade - measured by the gap between nominal and real yields - thus remains around 5 per cent, inconsistent with the government's inflation target. This gap has narrowed by around half a point over the last three months, but remains higher than before sterling left the exchange rate mechanism last autumn. The Bank provides two explanations for this market scepticism: the likelihood that wage inflation will accelerate when the recovery arrives, and the risk that some future government will choose to monetise Britain's growing public debt. The Bank offers no advice about how to deal with the wage problem. But on fiscal policy, it is more forthright, hinting strongly that the Treasury has not yet done enough to cut the budget deficit. There is a third reason for these investor nerves. No sensible banker would wilfully impose an unnecessarily high burden on future tax-payers. But the Bank continues to issue gilts at a minimum five year maturity even though the yield curve is steeply sloped. There can be only one explanation: in its heart, the Bank does not really believe in the government's inflation target either.</p>

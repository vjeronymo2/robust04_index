			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Survey of Sri Lanka (19): Putting the glitz on faded grandeur - Profile: Galle Face Hotel THE press release reads like an obituary for Asia's most venerable and charming hotel, writes Richard Cowper. The new management has 'proven experience in developing interactive tourism concepts. . . and has received international attention for the successful conceptualisation, restoration and redebut of the Raffles Hotel in Singapore,' it says. Upmarket Disney has come to Colombo's Galle Face Hotel. To the consternation of hotel cognoscenti the world over, Mr Cyril Gardiner, one of Asia's most idiosyncratic and much-loved hoteliers, has signed away day-to-day management of the hotel that has been his passion for 33 years. In August, Mr Gardiner, a wealthy patrician businessman who bought the Galle Face in 1960 after his GM car business was wiped out by a complete government ban on passenger cars, signed a deal with DBS Land, the Singaporean government-backed company, which owns the Raffles Hotel. In return for Dollars 7m investment in the Galle Face, DBS Land has gained a 25 per cent share of a new joint venture which has been granted a 99-year lease on the hotel and surrounding land. The Raffles has been given a 30-year contract to manage the hotel. For those who like their hotels well-packaged and easy to assimilate the glitzy Raffles treatment is likely to prove attractive. But for those who seek an escape from theme hotels with lobby chandeliers and obsequious staff who say: 'Have a nice day, sir' and for those who found Mr Gardiner's stately pile on the Indian Ocean near the top of their list, the new Galle Face may prove a disappointment. Many formed a deep attachment to the faded grandeur of a hotel that outdoes the Taj in Bombay for architectural splendour and the Eastern and Oriental in Penang for dramatic seafront views. Even the most committed of those who have stayed at the three-storey hotel - opened in 1864 next to Galle Face Green facing the Indian Ocean - would agree that it needs investment. The grandest ballroom in Asia outside Shanghai does not hide the fact that the hotel's roof is in need of replacement. A complete overhaul of the air conditioning, electrics, plumbing and phone system is necessary, while one virtually unuseable wing needs complete renovation. But despite all this the hotel works and the high-ceilinged rooms, with ancient barefoot waiters serving stengahs on a terrace the length of two cricket pitches, gives the place a unique magic. The fear is that the Raffles management, with its driving commercial imperative, and coming from a city where money is king, may end up creating a highly expensive birthday cake out of one that has evolved in a stately fashion over the past 129 years. Mr Gardiner, a man who gave discounts for non-smokers, never sacked an employee and for decades refused to countenance a shop in the confines of the 70-roomed hotel because it would smack of commercialism, may yet live to rue the day he made the deal. Or perhaps he is more canny than we can know. With a Dickensian passion for accounts he has never borrowed and last year made profits of SLRs19m. At 71 he no longer has the energy he once had and, as he himself says: 'I have to safeguard the Galle Face into the next century. The place needs renovation and investment, but not too much investment.' His deal with DBS ensures that his staff are employed until retirement, that he still retains a controlling share of the joint venture companies' equity, and he still retains ultimate sanction over all physical alterations. In the first development phase, over the next 12 months, DBS plans to spend most of its Dollars 7m on training staff in Singapore, refurbishing existing rooms, restoring the south wing, adding four new restaurants and a shop, a business centre and a health club. But in the next phase there seems certain to be as many as a dozen new shops and there is already talk of an extension, one of the very reasons some believe that the Raffles lost its ambience in an attempt to capture the hordes of tourists who pass through Singapore on package tours. The Raffles in Singapore had 1.5m visitors last year - about four times Sri Lanka's total tourist population. Mr Gardiner never liked his hotel too full.</p>

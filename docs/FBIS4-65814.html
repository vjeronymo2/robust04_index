			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Xavier Harel: "National Statistics Office Sees </F> France `On Its Way to Recovery'"]    [Text] According to the INSEE [National Institute of  Statistics and Economic Studies], a more vigorous recovery than  expected is giving rise to hopes that the rise in unemployment  will be "significantly smaller" than initial estimates. For the  second time since December, the INSEE's growth forecasts for the  second half of the year have been adjusted upwards.    The INSEE, which had predicted "a gradual reactivation" and  a  .5-percent increase in business in the first semester, now  believes that "the French economy is on its way to recovery,"  and is counting on a .9-percent increase of GDP. "Against a  background of a substantial increase in expected demand and in  exports, recovery would seem to be supported by a growth of  stocks, a slight reactivation of productive investments, and the  housing sector's dynamism," the INSEE stated.    In such conditions, even if there is zero growth in the  second semester, which would be highly unlikely, GDP will  increase by 1.3 percent in 1994. This figure will probably be  surpassed. Last Thursday, Economics Minister Edmond Alphandery  considered it "highly probable" that this summer the government  will adjust its 1.4-percent forecast for 1994 upwards. Two new  factors are underpinning this more favorable prognosis. To begin  with, a confirmation. The improvement in manufacturers'  expectations since the fall resulted in an increase in  manufacturing output. Even on the pessimistic assumption of  industrial production stagnating in March, it would still have  risen by 2.4 percent in the first quarter, thus invalidating the  INSEE's December forecasts (0.1 percent).    The second factor is a piece of good news: The labor market  has stabilized more rapidly than expected. Paid employment in  the non-agricultural business sector increased by 0.1 percent in  the first quarter thanks to a significant hiring increase in the  tertiary, particularly services, sector. In addition, the loss  of industrial jobs was less serious than expected (down 0.5  percent). Overall, "the rise of unemployment during the first  semester should be smaller than predicted (0.5 percent) in  December's statement," the INSEE anticipated.  <H5>  Recovery of Industrial Investments Confirmed </H5>   Why is recovery apparently more vigorous? To begin with, the  international environment is continuing to improve. The  locomotive effect of North American growth and the expansion of  Asian markets (excluding Japan) on the European economies has  become more tangible than in 1993. But, above all, "as regards  demand expectations, it is fairly established that things seem  to be getting better in Europe," according to Eric Chaney, one  of the authors of the INSEE's statement, who highlighted the  fact that most of the trade carried out by European Union  countries was carried out within Europe itself.    One of the factors which was working against recovery,  business stocking behavior, now seems to have taken a favorable  turn. The improvement in demand expectations is encouraging  manufacturers to slow down stock depletion, which in itself is  enough to contribute positively to growth. The slight increase  in the price of intermediate products (up 0.2 percent in the  first quarter) for the first time since 1992, highlights this  progress. The recovery of industrial investment, which this  year should rise by 1 to 2 percent after an 11-percent drop, is  being confirmed. In addition, these forecasts are more likely  to be adjusted upward than downward: Demand expectations, which  largely determine investment behavior, have been rising since  the autumn of 1993.  <H5>  Uncertainty in Financial Markets </H5>   Finally, "the improvement in the labor market that has been  noted since early in the year is gradually reestablishing  confidence among households, whose consumption may prove more  dynamic in the second quarter than in the first," the INSEE  stated.    The only shadow in the picture is cast by the uncertainties  besetting the financial markets. The rise in long-term interest  rates in most of the industrialized countries, including France,  as well as the acute volatility experienced in the financial  markets remain a reason for concern and could indirectly affect  economic activity, particularly in the real estate markets.</p>

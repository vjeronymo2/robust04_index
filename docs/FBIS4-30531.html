Present there were first vice-chairman of the Central  Standing Committee of the General Association of Korean  Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) Yi Chin-kyu, delegates of local  liaison councils of the associations of mothers, Korean women  activists in different areas and Korean women, teachers and  students.    A report and indignation speeches were made at the meeting.    Kim Il-son, delegate of the Central Liaison Council of the  Association of Mothers of Korean Schools in Japan, said in her  report that the violent assaults on students of Korean schools  in Japan are a despicable violation of the human rights of  children who should be protected most strictly in any society  and a typical example of criminal acts of national chauvinism.    Noting that the Japanese Government could never evade the  moral and legal obligations and responsibility to sincerely  protect the Korean students and national education either in  view of the crimes committed by Japan against the Korean nation  and Korean residents in Japan in the past or in view of the  world declaration on human rights and the convention on the  human rights of the children, she strongly demanded that it  should take responsible measures to prevent the recurrence of  such human right violation and national persecution.    The speakers expressed their resolution to unite closely  around the Chongnyon organization and make all efforts to bring  up the children to be true Koreans, believing in the homeland  and the Chongnyon organization in the future.    Read at the meeting were messages of encouragement from the  Central Committee of the Korean Democratic Women's Union, the  Education Commission of the Democratic People's Republic of  Korea, the Central Committee of the Trade Union of Educational  and Cultural Workers of Korea, and co-chairpersons of the South  Korean Federation of Women's Organizations, the South Korean  Council of Measures on the Volunteers Corps Problem, and the  South Korean Executive Committee of the "Asian Peace and Role of  the Women".    Sumiko Shimizu, Social-Democratic member of the House of  Councillors of Japan and other Japanese women activists who were  guests at the meeting made speeches.    They demanded that the Japanese Government sincerely  apologize for the colonial rule on Korea in the past.    Messages of request to the Japanese Government authorities  and the Central Committee of the "ROK Residents Association in  Japan" (Mindan) and a letter to the South Korean mothers and  students were adopted at the meeting.    The delegation selected at the meeting went to the Japanese  cabinet Secretariat, Ministry of Home Affairs, Ministry of  Education and Police Agency and handed the messages to them.</p>

			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Gatt 'would welcome renewal' Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, would welcome a decision by President Clinton to renew China's trade privileges. This would have an indirect bearing on China's bid for re-entry to the world trade system. 'Gatt has no responsibility in the area of political issues which underly the issue of Most Favoured Nation status, but the MFN decision has an indirect effect on the negotiations because MFN policy is relevant to Gatt members,' he said. China has stated its desire to be a founder member of the World Trade Organisation which - subject to international ratification - comes into being on January 1. The country was a Gatt founder member but quit after the communists came to power in 1949. Mr Sutherland recently returned from Beijing, where he found a great willingness to re-enter Gatt and meet its entry requirements. The prospects for resolving outstanding issues must be assisted by a satisfactory conclusion to any issues outstanding with one of the world's biggest traders, he said. To secure membership, China had to improve the transparency of its existing trade regime, demonstrate uniformity in applying those laws, clarify how its trading companies operate, and elucidate tariff and non-tariff barriers. But Mr Sutherland stressed that significant steps had already been taken in both trade and foreign exchange regimes. While questioning China's ability to become a member by January 1, Mr Sutherland has every confidence in the WTO itself being in place by then. 'I believe Mr Clinton is absolutely committed to the January 1 date, and I believe it's very important that the US as a leading trading country with an absolute interest in the development of the multilateral system should provide leadership in this area, and it seems it is determined to do so.'</p>

			<p><P> March 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UNION BANK WINS $5 MILLION IN SUIT AGAINST AUDITOR  </P> <P> An Orange County Superior Court jury Thursday ordered the accounting firm of  Arthur Young &amp; Co. to pay $5 million to Union Bank of San Francisco for  negligence in preparing financial statements on a small Los Angeles company.  </P> <P> Bank officials testified at the Santa Ana trial that they depended on the  accountants' financial statements when loaning about $10 million to Small World  Greetings, a gift company that later went bankrupt. The bank was seeking to  recover $6.7 million it said it was still owed.  </P> <P> A lawyer for Arthur Young said the jury, which deliberated for five days, also  faulted the bank for what he called "its own ineptness" in making the loans.  The accounting firm said it would appeal.  </P> <P> The suit was watched closely by both the banking and accounting industries.  With massive insolvencies in the thrift and banking industries, several major  suits recently have been brought against accounting firms for failing to detect  and report financial troubles of shaky institutions.  </P> <P> In its lawsuit, Union Bank accused accountants in the Orange County and  Pasadena offices of Arthur Young of negligence in preparing the financial  statements.  </P> <P> (The firm is now called Ernst &amp; Young after a 1989 merger with another big  national firm, Ernst &amp; Whinney.)  </P> <P> Based on the financial statements, Union Bank said it lent $5 million to Small  World Greetings in May, 1985, and another $5 million within the next year. The  company filed for bankruptcy in October, 1987. Arthur Young audited the company  in 1983, 1984 and 1985.  </P> <P> During the seven-week trial, Union Bank accused the accountants of  overestimating the value of Small World's inventory, one of the biggest items  on its balance sheet. It also said the auditor's opinion at the end of the  statement should have been a "limited" opinion, which indicates doubt about  some of the figures in the statement, rather than the "unqualified" opinion  Arthur Young appended. And a lawyer for the bank said the auditors -- some of  whom still work for Arthur Young -- "got too close" to and "too involved" with  the company.  </P> <P> The financial statements, in short, "didn't suggest a business going under in  any way, shape or form," said Bruce L. Simon, a Burlingame, Calif., lawyer who  represented the bank.  </P> <P> But Arthur Young's lawyer said it was the bank's own sloppy lending practices,  not the accounting firm, that was to blame.  </P> <P> "Our defense was twofold," said Gene Erbstoesser, a lawyer for the accounting  firm. "We did good work, and we stand behind it. This bank screwed up. The jury  agreed with the second statement, but unfortunately they didn't totally agree  with the first."  </P> <P> It's not uncommon for a small company with a seasonal business to go under  quickly, Erbstoesser said. Small World made pencil cases and other  back-to-school products such as stationery. When it went under in 1987, it was  having its best sales year at $27 million. As for the overstated inventory, the  accountants can only rely on the information the client gives them, Erbstoesser  said.  </P> <P> Arthur Young is also being sued by people who bought worthless bonds from  Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan in Irvine, who say they were misled by inaccurate  information prepared by the accounting firm.  </P> <P> And the accounting firm is being sued in Texas by the federal government for  $560 million in the wake of the $1-billion collapse of Western Savings Assn. in  Dallas, the largest such suit ever filed by the government against an auditor.  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. says the accounting firm should have  recognized numerous irregularities in Western's books.  </P></p>

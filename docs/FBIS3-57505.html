			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Konstantin Popov report under the "Press Conference" </F> rubric: "V.V. Zh. Looks Closer at Tundra"]    [Text] Vladimir Zhirinovskiy is true to himself. As soon  as journalists switched their attention to Yegor Gaydar  following his unexpected resignation, Zhirinovskiy immediately  tried to regain the initiative. He has succeeded in doing so to  a certain extent -- there was no room to swing a cat, as the  saying goes, at the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR]  chief's news conference yesterday.    Those who expected yet more scandalous statements from the  LDPR leader, however, were clearly disappointed. Neither  Zhirinovskiy, nor Gerhard Frey, leader of the German National  Union [GNU], said anything new; they only spoke over and over  again about the interparty cooperation between the LDPR and the  GNU and the prospects for friendly relations between the Russian  Federation and the FRG. Zhirinovskiy even expressed his hope  that in the near future a new  Berlin-Koenigsberg-Moscow-Urals-Khabarovsk-Vladivostok highway  will make it possible to transport peaceful freight from Japan  to Germany. Russia will benefit from that and will become a  great power once again. V.V. Zh. also dreams about Russian  becoming Germany's second language.    With regard to domestic policy, Zhirinovskiy promised that  as  soon as next fall he would form his one-party government (the  current one, he said, will break up soon), which will lead the  country along a special path and will be able to lift Russia out  of the crisis.    As a matter of fact, Zhirinovskiy dismissed all charges  regarding the propaganda of war: "The prosecutor's office has  not brought and will never bring charges against me," he said,  "Whereas my book, "The Last Dash to the South" will soon become  a mandatory textbook for all higher educational establishments  of the country." As for V.V. Zh.'s next masterpiece, it will be  entitled "Last Train Car to the North; Last Stop, Taymyr;  Residence Permit, the Tundra." The hint is ambiguous: either  Zhirinovskiy is going to send all his ill-wishers to Siberia, or  he plans to obtain a residence permit in the tundra himself.  Under a court ruling, one may assume.    For the time being, however, Zhirinovskiy "has to leave for  a  number of Balkan countries for a couple of days and to address a  2- million-strong rally in Belgrade." On his way back, V.V. Zh.  plans to spend a few hours in Warsaw.</p>

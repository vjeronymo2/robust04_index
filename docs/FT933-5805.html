The deal calls for NEC to supply NCR, the computer subsidiary of AT&amp;T, with IBM-compatible colour notebook PCs for one year initially. It will further the ties between NEC and AT&amp;T, which are already co-operating in the telecommunications and semiconductor fields. For example, NEC is the second source for AT&amp;T's Hobbit semiconductor chips. The Japanese company expects shipments of its colour notebooks to NCR to be more than 20,000 a year. The colour notebooks to be supplied by NEC use TFT-liquid crystal displays and are all manufactured in Japan. NEC launched the notebook in the US under its own brand in April.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Conrad Seidl: "`Austrians Want an EU Different </F> From the One on Offer'"]    [Text] Transferring freight traffic from road to rail is  the priority issue that Austrians want to see put into effect if  Austria joins the European Union [EU]. This is demanded mainly  by men and by the younger and better educated members of  society. Direct subsidies to agriculture are far less important  than other issues, such as crime prevention and the  simplification of administrative procedures.    This emerges from the opinion poll conducted for DER  STANDARD  by the "Market" research institute. In the view of Market's  chief, Werner Beutelmeyer, the findings indicate that the  Austrians -- and particularly those in favor of joining the EU  -- "basically want to have a different EU than the one on  offer." At the same time, expectations are high: One in three  Austrians demands that Austria send competent representatives to  Brussels; one in five wants Austria to participate in the  security alliance.    The concept of a security alliance is particularly  attractive  to the better educated and supporters of the Freedom Party of  Austria [FPOe]. The demand for maintaining neutrality, which  contradicts this view, continues to have a relative majority of  35 percent. Neutrality finds particularly few supporters within  the Austrian People's Party (25 percent) and the FPOe (28  percent).    The idea of further (eastern) states joining the EU is not  very popular -- FPOe voters are most likely to support it, while  the Social Democratic Party of Austria voters like the idea the  least.</p>

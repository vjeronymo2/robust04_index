			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Lasmo The recent fall in the oil price must be making a few eyes water in the Lasmo boardroom. Even though oil prices have averaged Dollars 17 a barrel this year, Lasmo is likely to lose money in 1993. This is despite Pounds 426m of exceptional items, including asset write downs, which the company took in respect of last year. In part, the unprofitability arises because the carrying value of some assets is still too high for current market conditions. Excluding depreciation, the cash flow position does look more healthy. That argues for a further write down, but Lasmo's balance sheet is already 70 per cent geared, so institutions and banks may bridle at a further sharp rise. The company's debt is also predominantly in dollars, and further falls in sterling would raise gearing too. Aside from accounting issues, Lasmo may have to conserve cash if the oil price continues below Dollars 15. The remains of the dividend must be under threat, and the capital expenditure programme may be curbed even though that threatens future development. The alternative of combining a capital injection with a passed dividend would be difficult to sell to shareholders. A bid for Lasmo's assets also seems unlikely while prospects are so uncertain and estimates of its asset value differ so markedly. Lasmo will have to hope that its US shareholders, who seem unconcerned about dividends, are in for the long haul.</p>

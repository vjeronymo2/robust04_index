			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Election '92: Major backs school entrance tests CONTROVERSY over whether state schools in England and Wales should be allowed to set entrance tests for pupils dominated yesterday's campaigning. Mr John Major, the prime minister, endorsed selection but insisted that it would not become widespread, while opposition parties condemned any move back towards a divided schools system. The Tories' education policy, launched yesterday, puts encouragement for opting-out at the top of the party's agenda for schools. It includes a commitment that grant-maintained schools 'will be able to change their character if that is what parents clearly want and the change fits in with the wider needs of the local area'. That implicit backing for a return to selection was attacked by Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader. 'It appears that the government is intent on introducing secondary moderns and selection through the back door,' he said. Mr Matthew Taylor, Liberal Democrat education spokesman, said: 'Tory plans for education don't mean parents choosing schools; they mean schools choosing children.' At his first campaign press conference, Mr Major predicted that the number of schools opting for grant-maintained status would rise sharply from its current level of 200 once the government was re-elected. Predicting a 'revolution' in education, he sought to dismiss suggestions that many schools would opt for 'grammar school' status. He hinted he would act to prevent too many becoming selective. Mr Major said: 'We are in favour of choice. This isn't going to open the door to huge numbers of grammar schools right across the country replacing the present comprehensive system. That isn't going to happen.' Where schools wanted to become selective, 'the secretary of state would not only look at the particular position of the school concerned', Mr Major added. 'He will also look at the range of school and opportunity available in the area. There may be some additional grammar schools. But it isn't going to be a widespread switch from the comprehensive system to the grammar school system.' Mr Major, who defended the government's education record and blamed local authorities for poor standards, said he expected an 'avalanche' of schools to seek grant-maintained status after the election. Questioned about the preference of most cabinet ministers for the private sector, he said: 'We are the party that believes in choice. What I am determined to do is to improve the quality of education in the state system so that everybody may feel absolutely confident in sending their children to the state system.' The Conservative education manifesto - entitled The 39 Steps  - includes only one new policy. Small schools will be able to opt out of local authority control in groups, sharing management costs. Mr Kenneth Clarke, education secretary, said this would be particularly attractive to small primary schools. The manifesto is silent on the organisation of schools should a large number opt out. It is widely expected that the government would be forced to appoint regional funding councils to manage them, but Mr Clarke refused to confirm this. Mr Clarke committed the Conservatives to 'uphold' - not expand  - the controversial assisted places scheme, under which the fees of more than 30,000 pupils at private schools are paid by the government. He also pledged to 'maintain the popular and well-respected A-level examinations'. Labour and the Liberal Democrats propose to replace these with a broader qualification. 'The next steps are to promote choice and diversity in our schools,' said Mr Clarke. 'More grant-maintained schools and more schools with a technology emphasis will mean a greater variety of schools. We will back the choice of parents by ensuring that popular schools are given the resources to expand.' Editorial Comment, page 18</p>

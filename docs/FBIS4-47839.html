			<p>BFN     [Text] Market nervousness at the possibility of a  two-thirds majority, once final election results are known, has  contributed to the commercial rand losing more than five cents  against the dollar. The rand has slipped to nearly 3.605 rands  against the dollar, a currency which is in short supply on the  local market. The rand has also lost five cents against  sterling to 5.42 rands. The financial rand has weakened by 11  cents to trade at 4.71 rands to the dollar.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Vienna/Seoul/Pyongyang -- In the future, North  Korea wants to discuss its nuclear program only with the United  States and no longer with the IAEA [International Atomic Energy  Agency]. This was confirmed on the sidelines of the meeting of  the Board of Governors of the IAEA in Vienna today by the head  of the North Korean delegation, Embassy Counselor Yun Ho-chin.  The communist-ruled country is being accused of building atomic  bombs. However, Pyongyang has not permitted the IAEA to carry  out comprehensive inspections in its nuclear center at Yongbyon.  Thus, the United States, South Korea, and Japan are considering  supporting UN sanctions against North Korea. Pyongyang has  reacted with the announcement that sanctions would be considered  a declaration of war.    South Korea's head of state, Kim Yong-sam, who sees a threat  to world peace, called a meeting of the country's National  Security Council, which will convene in Seoul on Wednesday [8  June]. In view of possible sanctions, the body wants to explain  the attitude of the United States, of Russia, China, and the UN  Security Council on the nuclear issue. It has so far become  clear that Moscow and Beijing would reject sanctions. As the  South Korean state news agency YONHAP reported today, Kim  described North Korea's nuclear program as a threat to world  peace. He called on the neighboring communist state to give up  its "ruthless development program for nuclear weapons."    Prior to the meeting of the Board of Governors of the IAEA,  the director general of the North Korean Atomic Agency, Pak  Yong-nam, stressed in a letter to IAEA head Hans Blix that his  country no longer feels bound by the conditions stipulated by  the IAEA if the IAEA should continue to exert pressure on North  Korea. "We really doubt whether the nuclear issue can be solved  through further talks with the IAEA," the letter reads. "We no  longer want to settle the problems within the framework of the  nonproliferation treaty, but in the third bilateral round of  talks with the United States," Pak Yong-nam added. The diplomat  stated that it would be better to resolve the technical problems  first and then the political problems.    In the letter that is available to DPA, Pak Yong-nam wrote  that, contrary to earlier statements by Blix, it is naturally  possible to find out whether North Korea has removed the  plutonium required for the production of nuclear weapons when it  exchanged the fuel rods in the five-megawatt reactor at  Yongbyon. He also reaffirmed North Korea's view that it wants  to maintain a special position within the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty, after it announced its resignation  about one year ago and later suspended this move.    If the IAEA should refer the North Korean nuclear issue to  the UN Security Council, "we no longer feel bound by the IAEA  and cannot but initiate the next step of our peaceful nuclear  activities," Pak concluded his letter. The crisis that broke  out one year ago exacerbated recently as a result of North  Korea's unauthorized disposal of fuel rods from its reactor.  Thus, the IAEA cannot ascertain whether plutonium was removed  for the construction of atomic bombs during the disposal.</p>

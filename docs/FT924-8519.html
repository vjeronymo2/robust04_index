			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Survey of Corporate Treasury Management 5: Gaps in information on markets - Richard Waters investigates the treasury operations of banks THE darkest hours for bank treasurers have traditionally come from big bets that went wrong. They have been the bets of individual traders who have been allowed to exceed their trading limits, leading to losses like that in Lloyds Bank's foreign exchange department in Lugarno in the 1970s. Or they have been the bets of entire banks, such as Midland's disastrous punt on UK interest rates three years ago. Now, there is another kind of loss just waiting to happen. It stems from the difficulties of managing the increasingly complex financial exposures that banks face, largely as a result of their involvement in a broad range of derivative markets - markets which were created, ironically, to help banks, corporate treasurers and institutional investors manage their exposures better. The Bank for International Settlements, the central bankers' club, carried out extensive interviews with 63 of the biggest players in these markets earlier this year - 55 of them banks. Its conclusion, published earlier this month: there are serious gaps in the information about and understanding of the new financial markets. 'Market participants, their self-regulatory bodies and central banks should set a high priority on deepening and broadening collective understanding of these markets,' it says. The extent to which banks have moved to limit their exposures varies from institution to institution. 'Some are more cognizant of the risks than others,' says the BIS. 'There is no single agreed best practice and, at many firms, significant gaps remain between the desired capabilities of risk management systems and the systems actually in operation, reflecting in most cases the significant costs involved in implementing them.' To operate effectively in the markets requires a 'substantial and continuous investment in people and systems', it adds. Most banks have now isolated risk management as a separate discipline within their treasury departments. Barclays, for instance, divides its treasury into liquidity management, capital funding and risk management. According to the BIS, most also treat risk management as a senior management concern. But many differences in approach and style remain. Some, for instance, try to control all risks centrally - an expensive and difficult process to follow. Others prefer to leave it to managers responsible for particular geographic or product areas. The hefty spending by banks on risk management has been put to the test in recent months - and, judging by the grumbling from some senior bankers, has been found wanting. The volatility in European financial markets caused by pressures within the European exchange rate mechanism was greater than had been allowed for in some banks' risk management models. A still more serious problem was the lack of liquidity in many markets as the crisis deepened in mid-September: any bank that was trying to hedge its exposures as it went along was suddenly faced with an inability to trade until the dust had settled. That greater liquidity risk is one of the biggest new exposures faced by bank treasurers. Others that are highlighted by the BIS include settlement risk (the danger that a clearing house will fail) and credit risk (the growth of off-balance sheet business makes it more difficult for banks to assess the credit-worthiness of their counterparties in financial markets). Concern about credit has led to increasing concentration in the markets, as treasurers have chosen to deal only with highly-rated counterparties. That concentration could itself potentially cause problems, since the failure or withdrawal of any big financial institution from the market would have far greater impact on banks at large. It is as well to remember, though, that while new risks have emerged, the old ones remain. Adam &amp; Co, a small Scottish bank, lost Pounds 21m - twice its capital - earlier this year from ill-judged speculation by two of its foreign exchange traders in currency futures. The traders hid the true picture from their managers and took ever-bigger risks in an attempt to make good the losses. The markets may have changed, but the risks remain the same. Meanwhile, recent sharp swings in currency markets have posed other problems for the treasurers of banks operating internationally. As currencies move, so the value of assets denominated in foreign currencies move when translated back into each bank's domestic currency. That can cause problems for any bank whose capital base does not match the currency composition of its assets. The long-anticipated rise of the US dollar potentially causes the biggest problems. Any non-US bank with substantial dollar assets has seen its balance sheet inflate, in domestic currency terms, as the dollar has risen. Against sterling, for instance, the dollar jumped from Dollars 2 to the pound in the summer to around Dollars 1.53. If banks do not also have a substantial part of their capital in dollars, then their all-important capital/asset ratio will have declined. Matching capital to assets to prevent this risk may not be easy to do. Most foreign banks' dollar capital counts only as 'tier 2' under the Basle capital adequacy accord, and the rules stipulate that tier 2 capital cannot exceed tier 1. So, while the rise of the dollar may have inflated tier 2 capital, it will have done little for the top tier, potentially causing banks a problem. This can be an expensive risk to cover. Simply buying dollars to include in tier 1 causes tax problems. One alternative, explored by Barclays and National Westminster, has been the use of dollar-denominated preference shares which would count as tier 2 but would be convertible into tier 1 when needed by the bank. Both banks have filed shelf registrations in the US to issue such instruments, though neither has yet done so.</p>

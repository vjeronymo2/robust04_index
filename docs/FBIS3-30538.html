Apostolovski: "Two Hundred Million Dinars for </F> Reviving Production"]    [Text] If we are to believe the words of Momir Pavlicevic,  republican minister for industry, at yesterday's meeting with  managers of large industrial concerns in Belgrade, Serbian  factories can count on some 200 million new dinars (German  marks) in "heavy" financial support as early as next week. The  meeting was held in the capital's Chamber of Commerce.    The minister said that talks between the government, its  expert team, and banks were drawing to a close, and that the  "plan for reviving production would be finished and ready for  implementation" by Monday. The plan envisages establishing a  fund, half of which -- 100 million dinars -- would be secured  from the banks' foreign currency reserves, while another 50  million would come from the reserves of companies that will have  to put it onto the market, Minister Pavlicevic said. The  remaining 50 million will be secured from advance payment for  the companies' products that are being manufactured. Yesterday,  several assessments of the funds needed to revive production in  the mainly idle factories were made. Rade Borojevic from the  city Chamber [of Commerce] said that 208 million German marks  [DM] were needed for this endeavor, and that these funds would  be invested in 13 companies. The economy has only 24 percent of  these funds. Rade Kolakovic, assistant manager of Beobanka,  estimated that during the first three months, some DM500 million  should be secured to help 60 companies. He warned that even  five or six former Yugoslavias would not be enough to satisfy  the industrial and labor capacities, and asked which criteria  would be applied in dividing the sweet 200 million cake [as  published].    The managers of Belgrade industry agreed on one thing  yesterday: Economy and production must be put on the agenda and  they must receive the funds.    We must have the money by the end of next week in order to  revive the production, said IMT [expansion unknown] manager  Ljubomir Stevanovic. "Not a single pensioner, policeman, or  civil servant (who has received the money) will be buying a  tractor or combine harvester, but bread and milk. Why wait, if  we get the loans, we should reopen Rekord [not further  specified] as well. We also have a shortage of tires. This can  be solved by freeing the merchant banks," said Stevanovic [as  published].    According to him, the social situation in the factories is  highly inflammable, and the workers are exhausted. He said that  the majority of Belgrade factories had not even paid out half of  the December salaries.    In terms of production, we have lost two months, warned  Slobodan Maric, manager of the Zemun-based Zmaj plant.    Talking about the current problems that the companies face,  Milan Samardzic, manager of the Industry of Metal Products from  Zemun, said that the net revenue of his factory equaled the  electricity bill, and was smaller then the funds needed for the  monthly public transport tickets of his workers. He asked who  had allowed the GSP [expansion unknown] to reintroduce social  policy in companies.    In response to the managers' many questions, Minister  Pavlicevic stressed that the program's priority task was to  create real resources for filling the budget, that is, reviving  production. He said that the "budget must be leveled out by  May."    Last year, 98 percent of money issued into circulation went  into the budget. This will not be repeated this year. We shall  invest in companies that have a short production cycle, and  those that manufacture finished products. In this way we will  also revive the associated companies, said the minister.    According to him, the price of public utilities will be  decreased next week, because the government has calculated that  prices are not based on the population's real wages.</p>

			<p><P> December 7, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN UNIVERSITY CANCELS EX-CHIEF'S $1-MILLION BUYOUT  </P> <P> The trustees of American University voted unanimously Thursday to rescind a  controversial offer to pay nearly $1 million to buy out the contract of Richard  Berendzen, the school's former president who pleaded guilty to making obscene  telephone calls.  </P> <P> Berendzen had asked the trustees to withdraw the offer after he was offered a  chance to return as a full professor on the physics faculty in the spring of  1992.  </P> <P> That agreement puts Berendzen, 51, on administrative leave with pay at his  faculty salary for the 1990-91 academic year and the fall 1991 semester. His  annual salary would be in the range of $70,000, officials said.  </P> <P> He has continued to draw his annual salary of about $140,000 since resigning as  president in April.  </P> <P> Berendzen, named president in 1980, pleaded guilty to making obscene telephone  calls to a woman from his office. Two 30-day jail terms were suspended in lieu  of psychiatric treatment.  </P></p>

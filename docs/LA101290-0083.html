			<p><P> October 12, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: SANTA PAULA;  </P> <P> WORD PROCESSOR TO AID STUDENT WRITERS  </P> <P> English students at Santa Paula's continuation high school will do their  writing on a word processor for the first time this year, thanks to a grant  from a national writing program and matching funds from local businesses.  </P> <P> Susan Anderson, English teacher at Renaissance High School, said she will  receive $3,000 to buy a word processor and software from the Southern  California Writing Project and Santa Paula companies.  </P> <P> The 10-year-old project teaches writing from an evaluation of how the brain  creates, rather than from a grammar textbook, Anderson said.  </P> <P> Anderson said she sometimes finds herself at odds with other teachers who  insist students learn grammar before attempting to write.  </P> <P> "It is my contention that students already think -- the brain does that -- and  if they can deep-think, it is easy for them to put what they already know on  paper if it is presented to them properly, and they can write out their own  lives," Anderson said.  </P> <P> Anderson's students will keep a family history scrapbook this year, collecting  recipes, photographs and stories of their ancestors, "because the past is  important and because they are experts about their own families," Anderson  said.  </P> <P> They will use three electric typewriters Anderson already had, as well as the  new word processor, to complete the project. As they begin to type their  reports, Anderson has found the students become interested in style and  grammar.  </P> <P> Anderson has also found her students write more willingly when they have an  audience. This year, they are corresponding with servicemen in Saudi Arabia.  </P> <P> "It is an exemplary program, which turns the students on to writing," said  Supt. Carolina Erie.  </P> <P> Anderson's students, many of whom have had discipline or attendance problems  and haven't succeeded at the traditional high school, score very well in the  reflective writing sections of California Assessment Program tests, Erie said.

			<p><P> March 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Three Salvadoran refugees in San Francisco went 24 days without food in a fast  designed to protest U.S. policies toward Salvadorans seeking political asylum.  Gilma Cruz, 22; Jose Cartagena, 26, and Jeremias Ruiz ended the fast Sunday at  St. John's Lutheran Church. "We are ending the fast with a strong call to the  North American people to go (into) the streets and demonstrate against the war  in El Salvador," said Cartegena. The United States maintains that refugees from  El Salvador are seeking economic opportunities, not fleeing political  persecution. Only 3% of Salvadoran applicants are granted political asylum,  compared with 54% of all other nationalities, said Carolina Castaneda, director  of the Central American Refugee Center.  </P></p>

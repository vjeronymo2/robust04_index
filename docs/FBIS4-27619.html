			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["U.S. Military Option Can Never Be Justified" -- KCNA </F> headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, June 2 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today  lambastes the bellicose outcries of U.S. hardline conservative  forces driving the situation on the Korean peninsula into  extremes.    U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry recently took issue  again with the "nuclear issue" of the DPRK. Talking about a  "critical situation" which might be created in case "sanctions"  are taken against the DPRK, he ordered a foreward deployment of  the extra- large aircraft carrier in a place where it can launch  into an operation on the Korean peninsula in a few days.    Meanwhile, U.S. Senator McCain called for deploying  additional U.S. forces in South Korea and exercising "military  strength," arguing that the peaceful nuclear program of the DPRK  was a "threat" to U.S. security.    The daily brands this as a criminal move to commit an  adventurous military action against the DPRK over the "nuclear  issue."    The news analyst says:    A few days ago, the spokesman for the International Atomic  Energy Agency and the official of the White House in charge of  national security said they believed the DPRK did not divert  nuclear fuel to other purposes.    Nevertheless, the U.S. hardline conservatives describe the  DPRK's nuclear program as a "factor of threat to the U.S.  security." This is a reversed logic of a brigand.    It goes without saying that this is an intrigue to justify  their attempt at isolating and stifling the DPRK, branding it as  "nuclear criminal."    It does not make sense at all that the DPRK which has no  nuclear weapon and is engaged only in peaceful nuclear  activities poses a "threat" to the United States far away across  the ocean.    To talk about "threat to the United States" from the DPRK is  as shameless as a murderer accusing the victim of a crime.    The campaign of the U.S. hardline conservative forces is a  despicable and vulgar act aimed at raising the prestige of the  U.S. military by deliberately aggravating the situation on the  Korean peninsula and getting reward for their service for the  arms trade of U.S. munitions monopolies.    With nothing can the United States justify its military  option.    We are not afraid of any "military strength" and will  sternly  counter it.</p>

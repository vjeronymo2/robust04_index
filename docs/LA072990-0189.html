			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PREP FOOTBALL SHRINE GAME;  </P> <P> NORTH MAKES THE BIGGER PLAYS, 19-14  </P> <P> In a game filled with big plays, the North needed three in the fourth quarter  to pull out a 19-14 victory over the South in the Shrine all-star football game  Saturday night before an estimated crowd of 3,000 at the Rose Bowl.  </P> <P> After seeing the South score its points on a 66-yard punt return by Charles  Levy and a 17-yard touchdown pass from Jack Manu to Jason Green, the North  called on its stars to shine in the game's final minutes.  </P> <P> With 2:26 remaining and the South ahead, 14-13, the North's Steve Hines of  Pittsburg started things off with a 46-yard punt return. Hines, who will attend  Washington State in the fall, avoided three tacklers near his 20 and then  weaved downfield to put the North into scoring position.  </P> <P> Hines also played a role in the North's next big play as he was on the  receiving end of a key third-down, 13-yard pass play from quarterback Eric  Bjornson of Oakland Bishop O'Dowd, taking the North to the South's 20.  </P> <P> With 52 seconds left, the North capitalized on its last big effort when John  Rushing of Merced, who scored twice, swept four yards for the winning  touchdown.  </P> <P> "All game we were confident that we were going to win," Hines said. "We had to  have some plays in the end and I just tried to get things happening with my  punt return."  </P> <P> Lynwood's Levy, who is headed to play quarterback at Arizona, said that the  South simply wasn't able to stop the North's big plays in the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> "Our defense had a little trouble in the end and we just lost it on a couple of  big plays," said Levy, who was named the South's most valuable player in  accounting for 125 yards total offense.  </P> <P> After Rushing's score, the South went to Trabuco Hills' Tim Manning at  quarterback and rallied past midfield on completions to Jeremy Smith of Bishop  Amat and Michael Ross of Carson. Their rally fell short, however, giving the  North its second win in the last three years.  </P> <P> "Sometimes the circumstances get to you and you lose a game," said Paramount  Coach Ken Sutch, who along with Jim Barnett of Trabuco Hills directed the South  team. "It's frustrating, but the kids gave it a good effort."  </P> <P> When Levy scored on a punt return less than a minute into the game, the South  appeared to be headed for its second consecutive easy victory, having won last  year's matchup, 23-7.  </P> <P> However, the North quickly answered by driving 80 yards to tie the game on a  three-yard run by Rushing. Running back Deon Strother of Oakland Skyline gained  36 yards in the drive.  </P> <P> Despite its big plays, the North was outgained in total offense, 305-265.  </P></p>

			<p>Trade   Detailed   <F P=102> TA2705143594 </F> <F P=103> TA2705143594 </F> <F P=104></F>    BFN     [Editorial Report] The SHABAT supplement of Tel Aviv  MA'ARIV in Hebrew on 27 May carries on pages 14, 15, and 19 a  3,000-word report by Yosi Walter on Israeli efforts to combat  the Lebanese drug trade.    Walter asserts that "about a year ago, a special team  appointed by Police Minister Moshe Shahal, which acted under a  heavy veil of secrecy," acquainted Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin  with a plan "to destroy Lebanon's poppy crops. Such an action  was supposed to deal a heavy blow to the Lebanese and Syrian  economies, but its primary goal was to lift one of the direst  threats to Israeli society--drugs brought in from Lebanon."    Walter states that the police minister's team suggested  several operational options. "The first option was to destroy  the poppy crops in al-Biqa'--the drug granary of Lebanon and  Syria--by bombing or crop dusting. This option was ruled out  because it entailed air activity in regions mostly controlled by  the Syrian Army, which are covered by an efficient antiaircraft  system.    "The second proposed method was bacteriological warfare." It  was rejected because of danger to Israeli crops.    "The third and most interesting option involved genetically  developed poppy seeds. These seeds grow only to half-maturity,  at which time they inseminate the other plants and  self-destruct. According to the plan, this chain reaction would  destroy most of the poppy crops in Lebanon, and in long term,  plantations in faraway countries as well. The method was given  60 to 70 percent odds--an amazing rate by any standards. The  prime minister embraced the idea, granting it a $1-million  budget over a five-year period. Rafi Peled, the previous police  chief, was acquainted with the plan, but did not get a chance to  begin its implementation. Today the plan is gathering dust at  national police headquarters."    Walter reports that Israeli efforts to combat the Lebanese  drug peril included a "special report compiled with the  objective of presenting it to the CIA and the U.S. Drug  Enforcement Administration, in a bid to convince Washington to  think twice before removing Syria and Lebanon from its list of  countries sponsoring the drug trade. The report, which was  compiled by intelligence and police staffers, exposes the Syrian  and Lebanese hypocrisy and fraudulence: How the Syrians and  Lebanese con the whole world while getting good money for drugs."    According to Walter, the report maintains that Syria  supplements its meager budget by participating in the drug  trade. "The report presents Syria not merely as an involved  country, which sponsors the Lebanese drug business, but also as  a crossroads and transit station for drug smuggling and  shipments. Raw materials--mainly opium from Iran, Pakistan,  Afghanistan, and Turkey--are shipped to Lebanon's al-Biqa' via  Syria. The finished products--hashish, heroin, and cocaine--are  shipped back from Lebanon via Syria on their way to the West,  and via Iran, Turkey, and Jordan on their way to Arab countries.  These drugs pass through Syrian air and sea ports."    The report further claims that "Damascus does fight drug  dealers, wreck poppy fields, destroy laboratories, or detain  smugglers and traffickers. Its object is to solve domestic  problems, rather than, God forbid, stop international trade."    Describing the "almost complete Syrian supremacy" in  Lebanon,  Walter cites the Israeli report as stating that sometimes "Syria  destroys crops in order to force Lebanese organizations to toe  the Syrian line."    The report is further cited on the subject of "Syria's  sponsoring of drug smugglers in return for bribes." According  to the report, "this method has permeated the Syrian upper  echelons. Syrian Defense Minister Mustafa Talas, for instance,  supplied a notorious Lebanese drug dealer with a laissez-passer.  A photocopy of the laissez-passer is included in the report.  Other reports indicate that General 'Ali Dubah [name as  transliterated], head of the Syrian security and intelligence  division in Lebanon, issued similar permits--some in Syria and  some in Lebanon."    Walter further states: "Syrian Intelligence has totally  taken over the port of Tripoli. Its members check every cargo  item, deciding on the customs to be paid by each and every drug  dealer. Some officers have branched out to the shipping  business." The report mentions the names of "several  high-ranking Syrian Army officers from generals on down, who are  involved in these deals."    Walter adds: "The main emphasis of the report is on the  involvement of the upper Syrian echelons--namely, President  al-Asad and his family. The report notes that while no  information directly linking al-Asad to the drug business is  available, some reports sustain the information claiming that he  is fully aware of what goes on around him and of which of his  close aides is involved in the drug trade." "Another prominent  figure mentioned in the report is Rif'at al-Asad, the  president's brother, whom the report describes as `an  insatiable, corrupt personality.'"</p>

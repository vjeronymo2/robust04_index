			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets: Milan ignores politics in Fiat-led euphoria - This week's rally in equities Sentiment, rather than fundamentals, has been driving Milan forward this week. In spite of growing political uncertainties, reinforced by yesterday's resignation of two cabinet ministers, a gloomy economic outlook and distinctly poor corporate earnings, the buying bandwagon has been enough to push the Comit index up 2.3 per cent on the week. The motor for this rally has been Fiat, Italy's biggest private-sector company, which on two separate days this week rose by some 10 per cent, closing yesterday at L5,360. The massive buying of its shares has been enough to trigger a general re-appraisal of Italian blue chips. There are legitimate grounds for greater optimism about Fiat. Ms Dagmar Bottenbruch of CSFB in Milan has recommended the stock as a 'buy' after lengthy scepticism. Among the reasons she identifies as advantageous for the group are the lira's departure from the ERM and last summer's agreement to abolish the 'scala mobile' wage indexation system. While the cheaper lira and lower wage growth will help the company improve its margins, a wave of new models will refresh its ageing line-up; and expectations of sales of subsidiaries such as Rinascente, Toro or Cogefar-Impresit will also provide big extraordinary gains to help tide the group over its current heavy investment phase. Such prospects, echoed by some other analysts, have been enough to trigger a general reconsideration of Fiat's shares, especially by foreigners, who have pared Italian holdings to the bone. Early buying turned into a wave this week as rumours of imminent asset sales or a tie-up with another car group swept the market. The realities are appreciably different: the company has repeatedly denied that it is talking to either Peugeot or Toyota - the two most-tipped names - and, indeed, the French and Japanese companies have issued denials of their own. Fiat has also maintained that negotiations on asset sales are not under way, although admitting that it has had some approaches. Even the industrial outlook hardly warrants this week's euphoria. Recession in other European car markets has now reached Italy, where demand fell by almost 14 per cent in January. Competition from foreign manufacturers, especially the Japanese, also remains acute with Nissan, in particular, increasing its penetration. Two other factors have contributed to the buoyant mood. The weak lira makes Italian shares look cheap for foreign investors and domestic institutions have been coming back into the market as a result of interest rate cuts. A statement by Mr Piero Barucci, the treasury minister, that promised incentives to buy shares would be pushed into law more quickly than expected provided an additional tonic. 'The market has decided to interpret all the news positively,' says Mr Marcello Sallusti, an analyst at Gemina. 'And bad news has been largely ignored. So shares have been moved by speculation and the fact that many portfolios have been very underweight in Italian equities.' The buying, however, has been somewhat unselective. While purchases, especially from abroad, have focused on blue chips, prime companies such as Benetton, Parmalat, Italgas or Edison, seen as among the biggest beneficiaries of the lira's decline, have not risen as strongly as many others. Many analysts struggle to justify buying big corporates such as Olivetti or Montedison, given the poor outlook for both; and the heavy buying of utilities such as Stet and Sip seems to be based as much on liquidity in the shares - making it easy to sell quickly if necessary - as on more fundamental factors. For those still interested in fundamentals, there is little to commend the bourse at present. 'The market has gone beyond fundamental values,' says Ms Paola Bergamaschi of Goldman Sachs. 'It's a real trading market in the short term. You either buy and then sell quickly, or hold the stock long-term in expectation of a better political and economic climate.' The risks are high. Politically, the coalition government of Mr Giuliano Amato is looking increasingly fragile, more so after yesterday's resignations of Mr Giovanni Goria, the finance minister, and Mr Francesco De Lorenzo, the health minister. The resulting uncertainty has had the effect of depressing the lira exchange rate, with the currency falling to around L950 against the D-Mark. Economically, the recession is deepening, with rising unemployment and slowing output. Meanwhile, the outlook for corporate profits remains gloomy. Very poor 1992 earnings, which will begin to be announced from next month, have already been discounted. Many analysts admit prospects for this year are little better. Some point to 1994 as the year of recovery. But even if there is light at the end of the tunnel, it is too far ahead to warrant the current euphoria.</p>

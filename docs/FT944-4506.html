			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Delors sets out Ulster aid plan Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, set out proposals yesterday for fresh money to support the peace process in Northern Ireland. He will ask heads of state meeting in Germany at the end of the week to approve a total of Ecus300m (Pounds 233m) to 'show the EU's solidarity with the people of Northern Ireland in their search for peace and reconciliation'. The aid, expected to meet no resistance from other EU leaders, will be used on urban and rural regeneration, unemployment, cross-border development and cross-community co-operation. Mr Delors has taken a close, personal interest in Northern Ireland's peace negotiations, frequently describing them as one of the most important things going on in the union. He said yesterday: 'We should seize the new opportunities for action in Northern Ireland and address the additional needs arising out of the peace process. This must be done now, to convince those on the ground that the peace process can yield real dividends to their lives.' The Ecu300m comes on top of an existing Ecu 1.23bn of aid for Northern Ireland in 1994-99 under the structural funds programme, and Ecu20m a year to the multinational International Fund for Ireland. The new aid, to be paid over three years starting next year, will go primarily to Northern Ireland but also to six bordering counties of the Irish Republic. The programme attached to the aid is based on the findings of a commission task force established by Mr Delors after the announcement of a ceasefire between the provisional IRA and the loyalists. The task force said interest rates on loans from the European Investment Bank should continue to be subsidised.</p>

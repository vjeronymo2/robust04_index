The $25 Guide outlines how to keep up with what's fresh in  pop music on a record budget of $25 a month (about $45 for CD buyers).  </P> <P> </P> <P> </P> <P> January  </P> <P> Jungle Brothers' "Done by the Forces of Nature" (Warner Bros.) -- Not quite as  pop-minded nor dramatic an expansion of rap's boundaries as De La Soul's  wonderfully eclectic "3 Feet High and Rising," but still an enticing  demonstration of the imagination and range of rap. Like "3 Feet," "Forces" is  an especially inviting starting point for those pop fans who still maintain  they can't stand rap.  </P> <P> Daniel Lanois' "Acadie" (Opal/Warner Bros.) -- Working with U2, Bob Dylan,  Peter Gabriel and Robbie Robertson established Lanois as one of the most  respected record producers of the late '80s. In his own solo debut, Lanois  demonstrates that he may be one of the most rewarding singer-songwriters of the  early '90s. There isn't the epic scope here you find in U2's "The Joshua Tree"  or Gabriel's "So," but these gentle explorations of life's mysteries and beauty  are framed in ethnic and roots-conscious styles (including Cajun and blues)  that echo the soulful purity of Ry Cooder and the artists whose works Lanois  has produced.  </P> <P> Soundgarden's "Louder Than Love" (A&amp;M) -- From a distance, it's to easy to  dismiss this Seattle outfit as just one more hard-rock band that is trying to  reap the rewards of the rock world's continuing craving for another Led  Zeppelin. What makes Soundgarden worth further inspection is that the quartet  realizes the important thing isn't duplicating the Zeppelin sound (remember  Kingdom Come's fate?), but reaching for the intensity reflected in the primal  screams of Zeppelin's most persuasive moments. Another reason for the quartet's  enormous potential is that the group doesn't tend to be retrospective. Like  Jane's Addiction, Soundgarden is racing to the future.  </P> <P> </P> <P> February  </P> <P> John Wesley Harding's "Here Comes the Groom" (Sire/Reprise) -- This young  British singer-songwriter may have borrowed his stage name from an old Bob  Dylan album title and some of his musical direction from Elvis Costello, but  his songs about human relationships and values carry a satire, wit and  compassion that make this the first great album of the '90s. He kicks off a  series of Southern California shows Wednesday at the Coach House.  </P> <P> They Might Be Giants' "Flood" (Elektra) -- The duo -- John Flansburgh and John  Linnell -- is a pop-rock rarity: They write satire without a trace of smugness.  The songs, about serious topics and loony ones, combine some of the ironic,  poignant and biting edges associated with such diverse spirits as Ray Davies  and Tom Lehrer. A feast of pop-rock imagination.  </P> <P> 3rd Bass' "The Cactus Album" (Def Jam) -- Where the Beastie Boys forged a  merger of punk, metal and rap, the second white group to catch fire in rap  sticks fairly close to a hard-core rap style, mirroring more of the hip-hop  authority of De La Soul's "Me Myself and I" than the crossover dreams of the  Beasties' "Fight for Your Right (to Party)." There are some creative lapses on  Side 1, but Side 2 kicks in with one of the most consistent half-hours of any  rap album. Besides, how could you not warm up to a group that opens Side 1 with  a nod to "Our Gang" and closes Side 2 with a wink to Abbott and Costello?  ROBERT HILBURN  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, April 16 (BTA) -- No political conditions  were set to Bulgaria at the negotiations with the Paris Club of  government creditors to reschedule the Bulgarian foreign debt,  Dimiter Kostov, first deputy finance minister and member of  Bulgaria's negotiating team, told the Bulgarian National  Television weekly show Panorama. The Bulgarian delegation and  the creditors reached an agreement consistent with the nation's  short and medium- term interests, he said.    The agreement provides for rescheduling the Bulgarian debt  over 11 years, with a seven-year grace period. It is a little  better than earlier ones and has a key role in the  implementation of international financial institutions'  financial support programme and for the settlement of the  Bulgarian debt to private creditor banks, the official said.    The finalization of the deal with Bulgaria's private  creditors (the London Club) began in Frankfurt this week, Kostov  recalled. The meeting in Frankfurt was attended by 63, or  actually all German banks, he said.    At this time debt-for-equity swaps cannot be discussed,  Deputy Prime Minister Valentin Karabashev told the same show.  The government is expected to consider an ordinance Karabashev  is sponsoring regulating the use of foreign-debt bonds in  privatization. The details will most likely be discussed at a  meeting next Thursday, he said.    The agreement with the International Monetary Fund on April  11 to support Bulgaria's economic reform programme includes a  Systemic Transformation Facility that would help the government  effect mass privatization, close down money-losers and  streamline state-run companies, said Karabashev.</p>

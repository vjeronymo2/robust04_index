			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Tories step up spending attack - Economic Strategy THE Conservatives stepped up their assault on Labour's economic strategy yesterday with an updated costing that puts the eventual price of the opposition's public spending pledges at Pounds 37bn a year. The costing - carried out by civil servants but with the interpretation of Labour's plans provided by ministers - will provide the basis for a sustained publicity campaign against the opposition's tax and spending policies. Last night a Conservative party political broadcast warned that income tax increases to fund those pledges would mean the average voter being Pounds 1,000 a year worse off under a Labour government. That will be followed by a poster and advertising campaign claiming that the losses - based on the assumption that basic rate tax jumped from 25p to 35p  -would range from Pounds 1,000 a year for the average reader of the Daily Mirror to Pounds 2,625 for FT readers. Mr David Mellor, the chief secretary to the Treasury, insisted that the figures, which attracted derision from the Labour party and a sceptical response from journalists at a Westminster press conference, were based on a rigorous analysis of Labour policy documents and statements. Pouring scorn on Labour's oft-repeated assertion that the party's only firm pledges were to raise child benefit and pensions, Mr Mellor cited many other commitments. They ranged from a promise to equalise retirement age at 60 (estimated cost Pounds 3bn a year), to the Pounds 100m it would cost to introduce a no-fault compensation scheme for NHS patients. Mr Mellor quoted extensively from the policy pronouncements of Labour's shadow ministers to undercut the party's disclaimer that, apart from the pensions and child benefit proposals, all other commitments would depend on economic growth. New pledges over the past few months meant that, once all the policies were 'up and running', the annual cost had risen by Pounds 2bn from the Pounds 35bn the Conservatives had estimated last June. In private, senior Tory strategists admit that some of Labour's pledges could be met by higher public borrowing, while in practice they would expect others to be delayed or dropped if Labour took office. They insist, however, that their latest costings provide a graphic illustration of a fundamental contradiction behind Labour policy - the promise of large-scale increases in public spending above those planned by the government with a parallel pledge not to raise the tax burden for most voters. Labour angrily rebuffed the Conservative calculations. Mr Gordon Brown, shadow trade and industry spokesman, said they were 'full of errors, riddled with falsehoods, exaggerated, compounded and multiplied by bogus figures'. Mr Tony Blair, shadow employment secretary, said he had found Pounds 3bn of errors in his area of responsibility alone, including an exaggerated cost for Labour's planned minimum wage.</p>

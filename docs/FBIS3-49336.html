			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Slovak President Michal Kovac by E. Fasung; </F> place and date not given: "He Is Trying To Be  Himself"--reprinted from Issue No. 1 of the weekly PLUS 7 DNI]    [Text] "According to the most recent public opinion polls,  you have become the most trustworthy Slovak politician. To what  do you attribute this trust?" asks E. Fasung in an interview  with President Michal Kovac in PLUS 7 DNI [Plus Seven Days] No.  1.    [Kovac] Already, while being sworn in, I declared my  intention to be the president of all citizens. In my conduct, I  want to fully live up to these words. I believe that a steadily  growing number of citizens of the Slovak Republic realizes the  sincerity of this effort of mine. I am trying to be myself,  independent of parties and the government.    [Fasung] Efforts have recently appeared that were aimed at  your scandalization. Do you think this was a reaction to the  fact that you also uphold ideas other than those held by the  ruling movement?    [Kovac] The scandalization of politicians is nothing new on  our domestic political scene. Unfortunately, it testifies to the  low standard of political culture that has struck roots here. It  is important that we learn to deal with problems in a  businesslike way, that we learn to rise above personal disputes  or different political views, and that we learn to see even in a  political opponent a partner who has the same interest in  resolving the complicated situation in which Slovakia finds  itself.    The present government emerged from the results of free and  democratic elections and acquired a regular mandate for a  four-year electoral term. In the event that the National Council  of the Slovak Republic deputies arrives at the opinion that it  is not functional, they have the constitutional right to pass a  vote of no-confidence in it. In that case, following an  agreement with the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] and  consultations with other parties, I would appoint as prime  minister a different personality, and ask it to form a new  government. However, I cannot imagine this to be a government,  in which the HZDS, which won the parliamentary elections, would  not be represented. I am convinced that Slovakia needs a broad  coalition government formed around the HZDS. Another possibility  is to shorten the electoral term and call early elections, from  which a new parliament and a new government would emerge, which,  however, would have to be formed with the assistance of several  parties. I consider it premature to speak about a specific  person that I would ask to form a new government.    [Fasung] What is your relationship with Mr. Meciar? Do you  also meet privately, or only in the course of your work?    [Kovac] My relations with the prime minister could be  described as working relations.</p>

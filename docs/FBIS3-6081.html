			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In connection with the mobile phone issue which has  created much trade friction between Japan and the United States,  the U.S. Government has informally asked the Japanese Government  to guarantee the fulfillment of a contract between the Japan  Mobile Communications Corporation [known as IDO] and Motorola by  preparing to impose sanctions against the IDO to force it to  fulfill its contract with Motorola. This was disclosed on 10  March by a source in the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications  [MPT]. Negotiations between the IDO and Motorola have almost  been settled, but the MPT, which sees the U.S. demand as  unreasonable, is concerned that if the United States sticks to  its demand, the results of the negotiations will be nil.    The same source said the U.S. Government has also asked the  Japanese Government through informal channels to have the IDO  cancel the transfer of its mobile phone business rights and  licenses to third parties. On 10 March the IDO and Motorola  agreed: 1) the IDO would increase the number of ground radio  stations for its Motorola-type mobile phone service to 159, and  2) of the NTT-type mobile phone service frequencies, 1.5 MHz  would be allotted to the Motorola-type mobile phone service.  Now they are meeting to finalize details of the agreement.    It is said the U.S. Government has been pressing the  Japanese  Government to promise that if the IDO fails to fulfill its  contract with Motorola, Tokyo will impose sanctions on the IDO.  So far the MPT has not negotiated directly with the U.S.  Government, but a top MPT official states: "Our ministry may  need to make a commitment in some form to the U.S. Government."  Specifically, the ministry has thought of giving the United  States a guarantee that it will simplify and quicken the current  procedures for licenses. The MPT is reacting against the U.S.  demand for fulfillment of the contract between the IDO and  Motorola, claiming the contract cannot be fulfilled by  administrative punishment, and any commitment to the fulfillment  of the contract could be turned into numerical targets. The  ministry intends to sound out the real intentions of the U.S.  trade representative.</p>

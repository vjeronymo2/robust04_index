			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Survey of The Bank of England (7): The driving force behind shake-up / Profile of Rupert Pennant-Rea Rupert Pennant-Rea's recruitment as deputy-governor in 1993, from the editorship of the Economist, caused considerable surprise. True, he had worked at the Bank in the mid-1970s, but before that he had worked as an official at the General and Municipal Workers' Union. The Bank has traditionally liked to have an outsider in one of its two top posts, and with Eddie George being promoted from within, the deputy-governor needed to be an external candidate. But rather than the conventional choice of a clearing banker, Norman Lamont opted for Pennant-Rea, a journalist. Former deputy-governor Sir Kit McMahon described the choice as 'a breathtaking insult to the Bank'. However, there was a certain logic to the move. The Economist, where Pennant-Rea became editor from 1986, regards itself as a cut above most newspapers, rather as the Bank looks down loftily on the clearers. Pennant-Rea personified the 'journalist as detached thinker' approach in which the Economist specialises; he was expected therefore to add some vigour to the policy debates at the Bank. In fact, much of his first year has been taken up with the old fashioned deputy-governor's task of managing the Bank. He was the driving force behind the Bank's reorganisation, which involved him in hard decisions, both at the macro level (the demise of the old international division) and at the micro level (the departure of a number of senior staff). His journalistic skills have shown up in a change of tone. Central bankers' public utterances are renowned for conveying as little information as possible in a generally turgid style. Pennant-Rea's speeches (which he writes himself) even essay the odd joke - for example, 'monetary restraint is not a hair-shirt but it has to be a habit' - and a daring note of candour: 'At the Bank of England, we are merely part of the supply lines. As such, we have the ability to mess things up - and our record shows we have often used it.' Former colleagues say his style is little changed by his move to the Bank - his pullovers still flout the normal conventions of City attire. 'He is one of life's immutable people,' according to one, while those who know him now say 'he still has a slightly undergraduate air'. His informality means that Bank staff address him as 'Rupert' rather than the traditional 'Mr Deputy'. But some of his opinions have changed. The Economist took the line that the Bank should not be involved in banking supervision, but Pennant-Rea confessed to the Treasury and Civil Service select committee that he had been converted to the Bank view. Friends say he is enjoying the job tremendously and is getting on well with Eddie George. He himself has hinted that he expects to be in the job for only five years or so, and in one interview, indicated that his previous career was not ideal training for the present job. 'My temperament is conditioned by the last 16 years as a journalist, which is a world of quick decisions and strong words,' he said. 'A central banker needs to be more silent and unrevealing. I am not very good at that.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] It was revealed on 23 April that the U.S.  Department of Defense [DOD] has briefed the Japanese defense  industry about the development costs concerning the Theater  Missile Defense (TMD) project, which will amount to $30 billion  (approximately 3 trillion yen). According to a source concerned  with the industry, the DOD has asked the Japanese industry "to  participate in the development of the TMD, or provide advanced  technology equivalent to the amount of the development costs."    Under the TMD system, reconnaissance satellites and other  devices confirm the launching of missiles by an enemy, then  multi-stage pursuit missiles shoot them down. Taking into  consideration that the DPRK (North Korea) has succeeded in test  launching a ballistic missile the range of which can reach  Japan, the United States has indicated its proposal to the  Defense Agency for joint development of the TMD system between  Japan and the United States. The two countries are now holding  working-level discussions on the proposal.    The Japanese defense industry has suffered from a decrease  in  business due to restraints on defense expenses. As stated by an  executive of a major missile-related company, for this reason  each defense-related company is considering whether it is  possible to make good use of its technology, stating that "the  TMD is an attractive project because it will lead to new  business projects."    However, it is not easy for them to provide the United  States  with technology equivalent to development costs totaling $30  billion. A person concerned with the industry said: "It is  feared that cooperation may not be limited to technology of  liquid crystals and compound materials, which the United States  has originally demanded." Moreover, it is expected the United  States will divert Japan's technology to other purposes, such as  civilian production.    According to an executive of a defense-related company,  because it is reportedly "difficult for both the Japanese  Government and private sector" to share a considerable amount of  the development costs due to the financial conditions and  management environment of private companies, Japan will likely  face difficulties in dealing with the U.S. proposal.</p>

			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / International Company News: Austrian Industries may delay flotation STATE-owned Austrian Industries (AI) may be forced to postpone plans to go public next year because of heavy losses at its aluminium arm, Austria Metall (AMAG). Metall is expected to suffer combined operating losses of Sch3bn (Dollars 264m) in 1991 and 1992, according to Mr Hugo Michael Sekyra, chairman of AI. AI has already gone through one postponement of an initial offering because of poor results at Voest Alpine, its steel subsidiary. It is widely suspected that a further delay could derail the whole privatisation concept of the Austrian government. Mr Sekyra said yesterday he might still try to go ahead with AI's initial offering by excluding AMAG from the group while the aluminium company is being restructured. AI will inject about Sch3bn into AMAG as a temporary bridge, but Mr Sekyra said AMAG had to cover its losses. The profitable packaging division, European Packaging Holding, could be floated in a public offering, he said. The Sch1.8bn initial public stock offering of the Vienna International Airport (VIE) has closed early because of heavy oversubscription.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cordoba (Argentina), 7 Jun (EFE) -- It was reported  today that the U.S. company Lockheed is studying the possibility  of establishing a plant in the Argentine province of Cordoba to  repair military aircraft.    Lockheed will this month sign a contract with officials in  Buenos Aires to modernize the 36 "Skyhawk A-4M" aircraft that  Argentina purchased from the United States for about $200  million.    According to the letter of intent that was signed, half of  the aircraft will be reconditioned in the Military Aircraft  Factory (FAMA) of Cordoba, 800 km northwest of Buenos Aires,  under the supervision of U.S. technicians.    The rest of the aircraft will be reconditioned at Lockheed  plants in the United States, so that half of the work will be  completed by late 1995.    Cordoba Industry Minister Jose Porta said that the U.S.  company intends to enter into a joint venture with FAMA, which  belongs to the Argentine military-industrial complex, to repair  other types of aircraft like the "Hercules C-130" transport  aircraft.    Porta pointed out that the U.S. company's proposal includes  the repair and maintenance of commercial aircraft.    Argentine authorities will give a response within the next  few days.</p>

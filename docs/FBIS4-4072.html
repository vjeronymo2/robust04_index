			<p>BFN     [Text] Guangzhou, April 27 (XINHUA)--The rich islands along  the coast of Guangdong Province in south China, have attracted  more and more domestic and foreign investors.    The largest investment project is a 120-billion-yuan (15  billion U.S. dollars) iron and steel complex, in whose building  foreign investors are allied with the Zhanjiang and Shanghai  Baoshan Iron and Steel Complex, one of the largest and most  up-to-date in China.    The project, dubbed "The Second Baoshan Iron and Steel  Complex", will be constructed on Zhanjiang's 286 sq km Donghai  Island, China's fifth largest. Rich in water resources for  industrial use, the island has excellent natural conditions for  seaports.    Up to now a 28 km highway has been constructed. Over 190  joint ventures have been established with domestic and foreign  investors.    Hailing Island, part of Yangjiang City, is another ideal  place for investors. Over ten multi-million dollar projects are  under construction or have been proposed. The island attracted  some 700,000 tourists last year.    Gaolan Island and Heng Qin Island have also been listed as  key development zones in Guangdong. Two 20,000-tonnage harbors  have been constructed at Gaolan Island and a 50,000-tonnage  container harbor and another 100,000-tonnage coal harbor are  being designed.    Heng Qin Island, which is close to Macao, will be turned  into  a commercial, tourist and storage center, according to  provincial officials.    Other booming islands include Nanao Island in Shantou,  Wanshan archipelago in Zhuhai, Shanchuan Island and Xiachuan  Island in Taishan City.</p>

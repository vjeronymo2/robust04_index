			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Vance and Owen win agreement on weapons in Bosnia UNITED Nations and EC officials and the leaders of the new Yugoslavia yesterday agreed to start placing heavy weapons in Bosnia-Hercegovina under international supervision today. But western diplomats last night said it was unrealistic to believe that Bosnia's Serbs, led by Mr Radovan Karadzic, would hand over their weapons if forces loyal to the Bosnian government refuse to comply with the agreement. Serb forces laying siege to Bihac fired artillery shells into the Bosnian town last night. 'There is no let-up in the fighting around Sarajevo,' a UN official said after visiting the Bosnian capital on Thursday with Mr Cyrus Vance, the UN's special envoy, and Lord Owen, the EC's mediator. They are joint chairmen of the Geneva talks on the former Yugoslavia. The agreement, signed by the UN, the EC, Mr Milan Panic, and Mr Dobrica Cosic, prime minister and president respectively of the new Yugoslavia, also included other measures aimed at implementing decisions taken at last month's London Conference. But they were not signed by Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. Mr Vance said the lengthy communique was 'not submitted to Mr Milosevic' and it was not necessary to obtain his approval. Mr Milosevic had a working lunch with Mr Vance, but he was not invited to a dinner last night with senior UN, EC, and Yugoslav officials. The agreement, which contained several vague commitments, also referred to the 'desirability' of sending international monitors to Bosnia-Hercegovina's borders as a means of stemming the flow of weapons to Bosnian, Serbian and Croatian forces fighting in Bosnia. But no mention was made about how many, or when they would be sent. Croatia and Serbia have together already seized large swathes of territory in Bosnia, leaving the Moslem Bosnian community, which makes up 43 per cent of the 4.3m population, with less than 10 per cent of the republic. The agreement also said that 'in principle', observers would monitor the airfields. But again, no mention was specifically made about when, how, and if the monitors would be deployed in Serbia and Montenegro, the two republics which constitute the rump Yugoslavia and which have been accused of supplying weapons to Bosnia's Serb forces. Moreover, despite a specific reference in the London Conference documents, UN, EC and Yugoslav officials yesterday did not refer to closing down Bosnia's air-space to the use of all military aircraft. Although the agreement also condemned the policy of 'ethnic cleansing' - the forcible deportation of civilians from Bosnia - and said that documents forcing them to give up their property were invalid, no mention was made about how the 2m refugees forced to leave their homes could return. In addition, last night's agreement did not specify when the main road between Zagreb, the Croatian capital, and Belgrade, the Serbian capital, would be opened. Instead, it said the route would be opened soon. It was closed after fighting broke out in Croatia in July 1991. Lord Owen will today fly back to London to meet EC foreign ministers, while Mr Vance will continue holding talks with Yugoslav officials. Mr Milan Panic, Yugoslavia's prime minister, yesterday appointed five new cabinet ministers in an effort to strengthen the federal government at the expense of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. Mr Ilija Djukic, ambassador to China, was named foreign minister, replacing Mr Vladislav Jovanovic, who on Thursday resigned after accusing Mr Panic of betraying Serbian interests. The other appointments included the posts of finance, agricultural and transport ministers. Mr Panic kept the defence portfolio. The sackings were the latest in a series of moves by Mr Panic to weaken Mr Milosevic's power base. The Belgrade-born California businessman has so far wrested control of the federal army and the Interior Ministry from the Serbian president.</p>

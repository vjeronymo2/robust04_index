			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Vladimir Yermolin report: "Army Needs Worthy Budget"] </F>   [Text] The State Duma Defense Committee conducted hearings  Tuesday on "The Social Protection of Servicemen, Persons  Discharged From Military Service, and Members of Their Families.  Housing for the Army. Status, Problems, and Ways of Finding  Solutions."    It seems unnecessary to spell out to our readers,  servicemen,  and military pensioners the reasons for which parliamentarians  are turning their attention to this theme. I will just mention  two aspects. First, the Russian Federation Government sent to  the State Duma for examination a draft law stipulating the  removal from existing legislation of a whole series of benefits  for servicemen and their families. Second, the hearings were a  last-ditch attempt somehow to exert influence primarily on the  Russian Federation Government on the eve of the repeat  discussion in the Duma of the draft law on the 1994 Federal  Budget, in which, as we know, defense spending was cut by at  least 18 trillion rubles [R]. And without the required sum of  R55 trillion, how can we talk about the social protection of  servicemen?    First to outline their stances during the hearings were the  Defense Ministry (Deputy Minister Colonel General Valeriy  Mironov), and the Ministry of Finance (Sergey Kondrashov, deputy  leader of Finance Ministry Department for the Defense Complex).  <H5>  Defense Ministry: Over 75 Percent of Officers' Families </H5> Have Incomes Below the Minimum Living Wage    It has to be recognized that in recent years the country's  leadership has demonstrated on several occasions its good  intentions in respect of servicemen. Over 40 edicts, decrees,  laws, and other legal acts have been issued which in one way or  another protect the military and their nearest and dearest.  There have also been state programs for housing construction,  and for resettling and catering for troops withdrawn from  abroad. And, finally, there are the basic guidelines for the  Russian Federation Government activity on social policy for  1994, where, again in black and white, there is mention of the  need to implement all (legislation-backed!) servicemen's rights.  So what has the Army got as a result? I will cite Col. Gen.  Valeriy Mironov (but, rest assured, hot on the heels of the  deputy minister these words will be repeated to us at any  Russian barracks): "There is a lack of decisions by the Russian  Federation Government on implementing a number of paragraphs in  the Russian Federation Law `On the Status of Servicemen,' the  level of pay is extremely low, the number of homeless is rising,  and psychological and physical overload owing to a shortage of  manpower is on the increase." The quick-fire retort -- it's all  been proclaimed, but it is not being implemented in practice:  Namely, the right to a place of residence in any populated area  of the country following discharge, the procedure for offering  servicemen and their families accommodations following  discharge, state insurance for servicemen, free shipment of a  serviceman's personal property when transferring to a new  service location....    A brief word on pay. Frankly, everything that needs to be  said was said in the subhead -- just one in four families keeps  its head above the poverty line. Is it really necessary to  paint a vivid picture of officer life, the domestic existence of  officer families, in order to depict precisely what this means?  So much has been said about this already! To all appearances,  in a country where the majority of the population only just  makes ends meet, people are no longer shocked by the notion of a  poverty-stricken officer. By way of an example, Col. Gen.  Mironov cited the case of a worker with the most lowly  qualifications at the Volga Motor Vehicle Plant [VAZ] who earns  R1.5 million. It emerges that a first category military pilot  would be better off nowadays resigning and going off to sweep up  metal filings in a VAZ workshop. And, indeed, this is what they  are doing. Most of them are men under 30, and generally the  most promising, energetic, and intelligent officers.    Accommodations are altogether a sore point. But particularly  for those discharged into the reserves. For the latter, the  program for providing accommodations in 1993 was only fulfilled  to a level of 15 percent. For those still in service, somewhere  in the region of 80 percent of what was planned was constructed.  This figure altogether knocks you off your feet. But the  thrust is one and the same: The volume of housing construction  is declining. The deputy defense minister said simply: Today,  the ministry has no opportunity to implement the government's  decrees "On Granting Russian Federation Citizens in Need of  Improved Accommodations Nonreturnable Subsidies To Construct or  Acquire Housing," and "On Measures for the Social Protection of  the Population Living in Closed Territorial-Administrative  Formations." And there is no mention at all of implementing  state programs -- at best, this aspect will hold its ground at  last year's level.    But you can go on analyzing the situation until you are blue  in the face, and you can go on recounting disaster after  disaster, but it all boils down to one thing: What is needed is  money. And there is none.  <H5>  Ministry of Finance: The State's Economy Will Not Stretch </H5> to a Defense Budget of R55 Trillion    However, in the opinion of Finance Ministry spokesman Sergey  Kondrashov, the problem is one of how to "stretch" a defense  budget albeit of just R37 trillion. As of today, the defense  budget in the first five months of 1994 was financed to a level  of just 77.1 percent. Let's think about this: While we argue  over the missing R18 trillion, while statesmen strike sparks in  heated debates, and we, here below, keep an eye on the battle of  the titans in the hope that they do not deal the final blow to  the Army -- all this time, the Armed Forces have been living for  almost six months with this same financial noose, some R37  trillion in length, around its neck. Yet even this measly 37  trillion is not forthcoming, which is why the noose around the  Army's neck is growing even tighter. It turns out that the whole  debate surrounding the defense budget is purely theoretical:  For economists from various schools, it is an opportunity to  make a brilliant display of their erudition; for the deputies,  it is a chance to perfect their debating skills; and for the  politicians, it is a chance to score points in the eyes of  gullible "soldier boys"....    So what is going on -- is it all villainy on the part of the  Ministry of Finance? For those who prefer independent analysis,  I will cite the following information for perusal: First,  according to the law presented by the government and adopted by  the Duma, in the second quarter of 1994 finance will be issued  at a speed "commensurate with the actual receipt into the  Federal Budget of taxes and payments"; second, in the first five  months of this year, 15 (yes, fifteen!) percent of the total  taxes planned for in the draft annual budget were received into  the budget. This figure was cited at the hearings by Sergey  Kondrashov. You can argue the details as much as you like,  accuse one another of bungling and abuses, and allocate billions  and trillions on paper, but if the state is unable to collect  the taxes, and if even at this early stage it is slashing the  size of projected revenue, then what is the value of any state  program? What is the value of laws which are not backed by a  single kopeck?    The unfortunate Finance Ministry representative first  expressed doubts that it might be possible to cram the provision  of all the Army's social needs into a sum as small (he agrees  with this) as R37 trillion, and then he expressed doubts over  the possibility of actually succeeding in scraping together even  these R37 trillion. The forecast for budget receipts is forcing  the Finance Ministry to resolve one specific task every month:  namely, whom to underpay, and by how much. As a result, the  debt to the military department has already hit 5.7 trillion.  And so it is that the debt-ridden state in the form of the  government is beginning to devise ways of offsetting this debt.  If the trillions in taxation cannot be obtained from the  commercial structures, then perhaps the pockets of the  disciplined military can be fleeced? So it is that a law has  been written which abolishes declared benefits. Pay has been  frozen. And instead of a suitable food allowance, all they have  received is compensation equal to one minimum wage. Indeed, the  government has accumulated quite a lot of these fruitful ideas,  the main one of which, it emerged, is not only to set a defense  budget below even the lowest level, but also to underfinance  even this miserliness. Any increase in pay can only be a pipe  dream, as all that remains is to beseech the gods that, come  Judgment Day, the cashier's grills might open. Meanwhile, in  June the Army will be underpaid by an even greater margin than  in May. This is what Kondrashov said, and he knows what he is  talking about. It was also noted that, according to official  calculations by the Finance Ministry and the Ministry of the  Economy, the "light at the end of the tunnel" will only start  glimmering at best at the end of 1995. But life has taught us  that the wisest thing is to prepare for the worst nevertheless.  <H5>  A Few Words About `Ways of Resolving...'? </H5>   The Defense Ministry has drawn up a whole package of draft  laws for state programs aimed at returning our Armed Forces to  the worthy place in society befitting their status. Some of  them have been handed over to the Main Legal Administration  under the Russian Federation president, and some are already  with the Russian Federation Government. There are also specific  proposals from the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of the  Economy. When it sits on Thursday the Duma Defense Committee  will probably sum up the results of the hearings and compile its  program of measures with due account of the sides' proposals.  All proposals, of course, warrant a more detailed discussion on  the pages of KRASNAYA ZVEZDA, but it is simply that newspaper  space is limited. But then it is better to talk about  intentions once they begin to acquire the form of completed  documents, ready for specific discussion.    I will merely point out that the second part of the hearings  progressed with the participation of representatives of  commercial structures who had arrived with businesslike  proposals on how to get moving on the "accursed" problem of  housing in the Army. This is a separate topic for discussion.  But as far as we can we will enlighten our readers about  certain programs.    The idea that the might of the Russian Army will "blossom"  through national business structures is emerging altogether  somewhat surreptitiously. The idea is preposterous, of course.  But then it is painfully disagreeable to think that our Army  should have to vegetate in the outer darkness without money for  another two years at least, and maybe even more. Who, then,  will emerge out of this "limbo" into God's world, and with what?  A section with a 45-mm gun and one missile? Just as in the  famous book which reminds us to this day of the glory which we  have inherited, the wealth of experience of defeat and victory.  But, as Kondrashov said, the Army will only be able to extract  itself from this impasse in conjunction with the entire national  economy. And without harboring illusions.</p>

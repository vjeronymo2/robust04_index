Since the  program is explicitly also addressed to the neutral states and  since "custom-made bilateral agreements" are possible, the two  points of the U.S. proposal submitted in October that are most  important for Switzerland have been taken up again, Daniel  Eckmann, the spokesman of the Department of Foreign Affairs  announced on Tuesday [11 January] upon an inquiry. Full  membership, however, is impossible for neutrality reasons.    Yet since the document adopted by the NATO summit in  Brussels  is more comprehensive than the project outlined by U.S. Defense  Secretary Les Aspin, its wording must be analyzed by the  Military and Foreign Affairs Departments so that the Federal  Council can discuss political steps. However, it is clear "that  Switzerland neither wants full membership nor any kind of  cooperation that might affect our neutrality," Eckmann stressed.    Owing to the character of the partnership treaties adopted  in  the Brussels document that makes possible custom-made  agreements, anything from the exchange of information,  cooperation in disaster relief, and operations that promote  peace is conceivable. However, the spokesman of the Foreign  Affairs Department ruled out joint field exercises with NATO  units, as proposed by the Brussels document for this year. The  goal of possible cooperation with NATO is ending Switzerland's  "security-political blind flight" and establishing an open and  structured dialogue with the Western military alliance.</p>

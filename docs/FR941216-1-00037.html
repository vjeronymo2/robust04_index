			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> This approach allows taxpayers to alter the timing of income or deductions on a qualifying debt instrument. For example, a taxpayer expecting a large positive adjustment on a contingent payment debt instrument before the maturity date can spread the adjustment over the remaining term of the debt instrument by legging into an integrated transaction. Other approaches to legging in, however, create similar opportunities. For example, an approach that would mark a qualifying debt instrument to market and defer any built-in gain or loss would present even greater opportunities for deferral. Requiring mark-to-market gain or loss to be taken into account immediately would provide opportunities for acceleration. The IRS and Treasury believe that taking the built-in gain or loss into account over the term of the qualifying debt instrument produces the most reasonable result. To prevent abuse, however, the proposed regulations include a special rule providing that if a taxpayer legs into an integrated transaction with a principal purpose of deferring or accelerating income, the Commissioner may treat the qualifying debt instrument as sold or otherwise terminated and reacquired or reissued on the leg-in date or may refuse to allow integration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Legging out of an integrated transaction generally means disposing of or otherwise terminating the &sect;1.1275&hyph;6 hedge or the qualifying debt instrument. If the Commissioner has integrated a qualifying debt instrument and a financial instrument, the taxpayer is treated as legging out only if the taxpayer ceases to meet the requirements for Commissioner integration. If a taxpayer legs out, the synthetic debt instrument is treated as sold or otherwise disposed of for its fair market value and any income, deduction, gain, or loss is taken into account immediately. The component the taxpayer retains (either the &sect;1.1275&hyph;6 hedge or the qualifying debt instrument) is treated as immediately reacquired for, or entered into at, its fair market value on the leg-out date. In order to prevent taxpayers from inappropriately generating tax losses by legging into and immediately legging out of an integrated transaction, the proposed regulations contain a wash sale rule that disallows losses if the taxpayer legs out within 30 days of legging into an integrated transaction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If a qualifying debt instrument and a &sect;1.1275&hyph;6 hedge are integrated, the instruments are no longer subject to the rules that govern each instrument separately, except as specifically provided in the regulations or by publication in the Internal Revenue Bulletin. Instead, the instruments are subject to the rules that would govern the synthetic debt instrument. For example, the qualifying debt instrument and &sect;1.1275&hyph;6 hedge are not treated as part of a straddle under section 1092, but the interest on the synthetic debt instrument may be subject to the interest capitalization rules of section 263(g).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The issue price of the synthetic debt instrument is the adjusted issue price of the qualifying debt instrument. The issue date of the synthetic debt instrument is the date the &sect;1.1275&hyph;6 hedge is acquired. The term of the synthetic debt instrument is the period from the issue date of the synthetic debt instrument to the maturity date of the qualifying debt instrument. If the synthetic debt instrument is a borrowing, its stated redemption price at maturity is the sum of all amounts paid or to be paid on the qualifying debt instrument and on the &sect;1.1275&hyph;6 hedge, reduced by all amounts received or to be received on the hedge and any amounts that would be qualified stated interest on the synthetic debt instrument. If the synthetic debt instrument is a loan, its stated redemption price at maturity is the sum of all amounts received or to be received on the qualifying debt instrument and the &sect;1.1275&hyph;6 hedge, reduced by all amounts paid or to be paid on the hedge and any amounts that would be qualified stated interest on the synthetic debt instrument.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The rules for determining the stated redemption price at maturity are designed to cover situations where payments on the hedge move inversely to the payments on the qualifying debt instrument. For example, if a holder of a qualifying debt instrument purchases an option to hedge the debt instrument, the amount paid by the holder must be taken into account as an adjustment to the instrument's stated redemption price at maturity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Separate transaction treatment is required for certain limited purposes. For example, the rules of sections 871(a), 881, 1441, and 1442 must be applied on a separate transaction basis. Similarly, any information reporting rules for the qualifying debt instrument continue to apply as if the qualifying debt instrument and the &sect;1.1275&hyph;6 hedge were not part of an integrated transaction. The IRS and Treasury request comments on whether the regulations should specifically provide separate transaction treatment for other purposes. The IRS and Treasury also request comments on whether rules similar to &sect;1.6045&hyph;1(d)(6)(iii) of the proposed regulations (regarding broker reporting of an integrated transaction under &sect;1.988&hyph;5) should be adopted for an integrated transaction under &sect;1.1275&hyph;6.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The IRS and Treasury intend to propose rules coordinating &sect;1.1275&hyph;6 with section 475. Comments are requested on this issue.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 --> Proposed Effective Date  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> In general, the proposed regulations in this document are proposed to be effective for debt instruments issued on or after the date that is 60 days after the date final regulations are published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Special Analyses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It has been determined that this notice of proposed rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action as defined in EO 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It also has been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations, and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, this notice of proposed rulemaking will be submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration for comment on its impact on small business.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Comments and Public Hearing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Before these proposed regulations are adopted as final regulations, consideration will be given to any written comments (a signed original and eight (8) copies) that are submitted timely to the IRS. All comments will be available for public inspection and copying.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

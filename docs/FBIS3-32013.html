			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Army General Raul Castro, minister of the  Revolutionary Armed Forces [FAR], participated in the military  council of the Eastern Army held in Camaguey, after which he  toured areas of that province. The last point to be discussed by  the military council was the fishing industry. The last point of  the 30 February visit was the People's Fish Breeding Center in  Sibanicu municipality, reflecting the importance with which the  country's leadership regards this sector, which is decisive in  increasing the food levels of the population. (Enrique  Ortosqui), vice minister of the fishing industry, presented the  current situation and goals in the development of artificial  breeding of fish on the island.    In the same manner, Division General Carlos Fernandez  Gondin,  first vice minister of the interior, presented a detailed  analysis, which is being made throughout the country against  criminal activities and social indiscipline. He pointed out  advances made, as well as difficulties, and expressed his  conviction that with the participation of the masses, the  perfection of the Unified Vigilance and Protection System, and  the required action of the judiciary power within the framework  of existing laws or those that need to be established, this  struggle will be won by the Revolution.    In his tour of the Oriente Rebelde community in Sibanicu,  Raul visited the Salvador Cisneros Betancourt elementary school,  which was completed in just 45 days by FAR combatants and by  instruction from the second secretary of the Communist Party of  Cuba [PCC]. At the facility, which has capacity for more than  200 children, Raul received detailed information on the  characteristics of the center. At the nearby plaza, the children  presented an art show, which reflected the different stages of  our history, including the uprising of Ignacio Agramonte in  November 1868 at the Oriente sugar Mill, very close to the place  where the community is established today.    Emilia Betancourt, president of the people's council and  deputy to the National Assembly of the People's Government  [ANPP], explained to the visitors aspects of this cattle-raising  zone in self-sufficiency, services, the defense tasks, and among  other things, the fight against crime. A plaque at the school  reads: With great satisfaction I have come to learn the  experience of Oriente Rebelde. Everything I have seen has been  very interesting, including conversations with the workers and  cadres. We have analyzed agriculture in general, enterprises,  farms, Basic Cooperative Production Units, self-sufficiency,  subsidies that must be eliminated, [words indistinct] seek  efficiency and productivity, and work hard to increase the food  levels in the fields [words indistinct]. Signed: Fidel Castro.    At the historical sugarmill, which is destined to become a  museum of the sugar industry, Raul conversed on the  characteristics of the installation, the largest in the province  in the second half of the last century. He expressed his  admiration for Ignacio Agramonte, one of our most important  historical figures, and the fact that in the war of 1895, in  their advance towards the West, Maximo Gomez camped there also.    Fish Breeding is one of the main objectives for Sibanicu. In  1993, the municipality caught more than 300 [words indistinct]  and this year they hope to exceed that figure. [words  indistinct] in half hectare each they can produce [words  indistinct] and at the same time, the cattle can take advantage  of the water in these small dams. After listening to the  exposition of Omar del Risco, first secretary of the PCC in  Sibanicu, Raul congratulated him for the exemplary work of this  municipality in the development of the fishing industry, which  is currently the cheapest and fastest means of production of  animal protein, and states that it would be very useful if  representatives from other provinces could come here to gain  experience in this important task.    In his tour of Sibanicu, Raul was accompanied by the first  secretaries of the six provinces that are part of the Eastern  Army, Ramon Espinosa Martin, head of the Eastern Army; and Vilma  Espin, president of the Federation of Cuban Women.</p>

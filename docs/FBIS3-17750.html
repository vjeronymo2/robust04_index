			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ukrainian Deputy Defense Minister Ivan </F> Bizhan by unidentified reporter; place and date not given --  recorded]    [Excerpt] [Reporter] Ivan Vasilyevych, you have just  returned from the Crimea. The most acute problem facing your  branch is the order issued by President of the Crimean Autonomy  [as heard] Meshkov regarding the military service of Crimean  residents on Crimean territory. What are your impressions and  assessments of this development?    [Bizhan] Your question is right. Really, it is very  important that such a question has been raised. This is why the  [defense] minister resolved so forcefully and quickly to send a  group to the Crimea headed by the deputy defense minister to  immediately, so to say, examine the situation on the spot.    My impressions are the following. I am very glad that our  military structures -- including the Crimea's military  commissar, the military commissar of Sevastopol, the command of  our Navy and Air Force, and the 32d Corps Command -- understand  it in such a way as they should understand: This order is  unlawful, has no underlaying legal basis, and is not subject to  being obeyed. They will not obey it. That is to say, it is not  necessary today to conduct work with this commanding structure  to elucidate the position of the defense minister. Therefore,  after my return, I was glad to report to the defense minister  that we have conscious and aware people there -- they are  Ukrainian citizens, real and true, and they will comply to  Ukraine's laws and the instructions of our supreme commander of  the Armed Forces and the defense minister.

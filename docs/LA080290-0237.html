			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> FOREIGNERS LIVING IN KUWAIT DESCRIBE LIGHTNING ATTACK;  </P> <P> IRAQ INVASION: REACHED BY TELEPHONE, EXPATRIATES TELL OF FEAR WHILE HEARING  GUNFIRE, EXPLOSIONS, JETS AND HELICOPTERS NEARBY.  </P> <P> Foreigners living in Kuwait said they watched from their windows or dived for  cover when Iraq staged a lightning invasion of Kuwait today.  </P> <P> Reached by telephone from Bahrain, the expatriates told of hearing gunfire,  explosions and jets and helicopters overhead as the Iraqi troops moved in  before dawn.  </P> <P> "Unbelievable," said Catherine Baker, 37, of Illinois, who works for a British  design firm in the small, oil-rich nation. "It doesn't seem real."  </P> <P> There are about 4,000 Americans among the large expatriate community in Kuwait,  where more than 60% of the 1.8 million residents are foreigners.  </P> <P> Baker said she was shocked by the suddenness of the Iraqi strike, although  Iraqi President Saddam Hussein had made threats against Kuwait in recent weeks.  </P> <P> "We were totally unprepared," she said. "One feels like there should have been  a bit of warning."  </P> <P> Diplomats said the British Embassy was hit by shellfire and that the Sheraton  and Hilton hotels evacuated their clientele.  </P> <P> Kathy McGregor, 32, a Canadian, said one explosion was close enough to shake  her home.  </P> <P> "You know when you see a movie, when people dive for cover? We did it. The  explosion blew inside the house, shaking it."  </P> <P> "It's chaos, military jets are flying over all the time," McGregor said by  telephone early today as she watched from her window. But in the afternoon, she  said things had quieted down considerably.  </P> <P> "There is not much noise or gunfire. I feel better with more people around  now," she said.  </P> <P> Some expatriates said they did not want to leave despite the invasion.  </P> <P> "I think it will be over soon somehow," said Serge Sejournet, 30, an artist  from Paris. "I don't think I want to get out of Kuwait."  </P> <P> Sejournet said the Iraqi soldiers on the street in front of his home in  downtown Kuwait were "very friendly with everyone, saying hello to all."  </P> <P> Sejournet, Baker and other expatriates said they gathered together in homes of  friends, listening to the fighting.  </P> <P> Anxious friends and relatives of those living in Kuwait found it difficult or  impossible to get in touch with them. In Washington, a spokesman for AT&amp;T  said calls to Kuwait reached 2,000 every five minutes. The spokesman, Herb  Linnen, said only some of the calls were getting through and that there were  long delays because of the heavy volume.  </P> <P> Linnen said the company itself had managed to get only one call through to its  employees in Kuwait today and ascertained that its several dozen employees and  their families were safe.  </P> <P> AT&amp;T employees in Kuwait include Americans, Canadians, British, Filipinos  and one Sri Lankan who have been working on a project with the Kuwaiti  government to improve communications, he said.  </P> <P> The State Department, meanwhile, set up a 24-hour hot line for people seeking  information about the safety of American relatives and friends in Kuwait and  Iraq. The number is (202) 647-0900.  </P> <P> </P> <P> IRAQ-KUWAIT: WORLD REACTION  </P> <P> Soviet Union: After a meeting between Secretary of State James A. Baker III and  Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze in Siberia, Iraq's main supplier of  arms suspended delivery of all military equipment and called for an immediate  withdrawal.  </P> <P> Israel: Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's spokesman said the invasion confirms  Israeli warnings that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's war threats should be  taken seriously.  </P> <P> Britain: London joined the United States in freezing Kuwaiti assets to prevent  Iraq from seizing them.  </P> <P> United Nations: In a rare pre-dawn emergency session in New York, the body  swiftly condemned the invasion and demanded Iraq's immediate and unconditional  withdrawal.  </P> <P> France: Iraq's second-largest arms supplier issued a "total and unreserved  condemnation" and demanded an immediate pullout.  </P> <P> China: A "deeply concerned" Beijing appealed for an immediate halt to military  action.  </P> <P> Japan: The Foreign Ministry called the invasion "extremely regrettable." Tokyo  depends on Persian Gulf crude oil for 70% of its petroleum needs.  </P> <P> Arab League: An emergency session was convened to consider a response. Only  Lebanon immediately condemned the invasion.  </P></p>

			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Smith attacks rise in crime MR JOHN SMITH yesterday urged the government to act over rising crime rates, saying it was 'a deplorable indictment of Conservative government' that crime had more than doubled during the party's years in office, David Owen writes. At question time, the Labour leader asked the prime minister whether he thought it was 'remotely tolerable' that there were 'something like 25,000 break-ins' every week. 'When are you going to do something about protecting our citizens from that?', Mr Smith asked. Mr John Major argued that the government's record on combating crime was 'comparable with that of other countries in western Europe.' Ever since the second world war, crime had increased under all governments, he said. 'You seem to want to put the blame for each and every thing on the shoulders of the government,' he told Mr Smith.</p>

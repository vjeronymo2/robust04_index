Bouslimani's body was found a week ago in El Affroun near  Blida two months after his abduction at the end of November.    A police statement said agronomist Guitoun Nasser and imam  Rashid Zerani, 26, an inspector in Algeria's fraud squad, had  kidnapped the charity leader on the orders of Djaafar al-Afghani  leader of the Islamic Armed Group (GIA).    It said Al-Afghani had ordered the killing after a series of  discussions with Bouslimani.</p>

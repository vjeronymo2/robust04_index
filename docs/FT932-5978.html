			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / Economics: Unemployment data expected to show gloomy state of Europe's labour market THE problem of high unemployment will be taxing the minds of ministers from the world's leading industrial nations this week, as a string of poor unemployment data is expected in Germany, Belgium, Denmark, Finland and the US. The European figures are likely to confirm the gloomy state of the continent's labour market, while in the US the markets will be nervously watching non-farm payroll figures at the end of the week. The OECD has already announced that unemployment will be one of the issues dominating the ministerial meeting in Paris on Wednesday and Thursday. In their discussions, ministers from over 20 countries will focus on promoting sustainable economic growth, but with the emphasis on the current bad employment situation, particularly within the European Community. There will also be discussions on trade as world recession has prompted countries to become more protectionist. The release of industrial output figures in Germany this week will come as a timely reminder of the sluggishness of world growth. The output figures are forecast to show that economic activity in west Germany is being depressed by high interest rates even though these are gradually being eased by the Bundesbank. Some economists are suggesting, however, that the rate of economic decline in Germany is slowing as Germany's export industries are helped by continuing growth in the US and signs of recovery in the UK. In the US, May non-farm payrolls are expected to show fairly healthy rise. Economists believe most of the jobs growth will have come from the service sector. The unemployment rate should remain unchanged at 7 per cent. The following are the week's other economic highlights and events.

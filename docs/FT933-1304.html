			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Caverdale to raise Pounds 3.2m through placing CAVERDALE Group, the motor retailing and industrial consumables concern, yesterday announced plans to raise a net Pounds 3.17m through a placing and open offer. Directors of the Luton-based group said the proceeds would be used to replenish the cash cost of recent acquisitions and to meet increased working capital requirements of the enlarged group. Further acquisitions would be sought, they added. The placing is of 27.22m new shares at 12 1/2 p, conditionally placed with institutional and other shareholders by Carr Kitcat and Aitken. Shareholders are offered a full clawback on a 1-for-6 basis. Directors said there had been 'no significant change' in the group's financial or trading position since the interim results were published in July showing a turnround from losses of Pounds 272,000 to pre-tax profits of Pounds 663,000. They also said an early return to the dividend list was 'realistic'.</p>

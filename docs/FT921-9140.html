			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Big rise found in seized homes LABOUR said last night that statistics to be released today by the Council of Mortgage Lenders show 78,000 homes were repossessed last year, up from 44,000 in 1990. Figures leaked to the party were said to indicate that at the end of December 270,000 households were more than six months in arrears with mortgage payments, an increase of 50,000 on the figure for the end of June. Labour also published research showing that in every region of England except London, the number of homes empty because of repossessions was more than the number of homeless families in temporary accommodation. The party added that there were 220,000 empty homes on the market left unsold because of the housing slump. Mr Bryan Gould, the shadow environment secretary, warned that the backlog of unsold properties meant the housing market had no hope of recovery in the next year. He promised that a Labour government would buy some of the empty homes to rehouse homeless families.</p>

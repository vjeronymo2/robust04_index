			<p><P> March 30, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> FAHD AND MUBARAK CONFER ON A SLOW TRAIN TO ALEXANDRIA  </P> <P> King Fahd of Saudi Arabia and President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt resumed their  talks on the Middle East on Wednesday while traveling on a slow train to the  Mediterranean resort city of Alexandria, officials said.  </P> <P> Crowds cheered and waved as they rode by on their way to Alexandria, 140 miles  northwest of Cairo. Fahd and Mubarak began Wednesday's talks on the train and  planned to continue them at the former royal palace.  </P> <P> Officials said that Fahd, who arrived in Egypt on Monday from Iraq on a  four-day official tour, decided to extend his visit by one day to devote more  time for talks with Mubarak. The visit was the first by a Saudi monarch in 15  years.  </P> <P> The officials said the talks have covered a wide range of Arab, Islamic,  regional and international issues but apparently have avoided the thorny issue  of Egypt's request for readmission to the 22-member Arab League.  </P></p>

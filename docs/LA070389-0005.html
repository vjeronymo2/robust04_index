			<p><P> July 3, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHINA  </P> <P> While China slaughters its children and freedom seekers, where is the  hastily-called United Nations session to condemn the terrorism and inhumanity,  as with Israel? Where are the demonstrations demanding a withdrawal of all  investments, as with South Africa? Where is the Administration's fanatic  dedication to overthrowing communists in favor of freedom fighter, as we have  been doing in Nicaragua?  </P> <P> Where are the marching liberals, civil rights activists? Why the thunderous  silence?  </P> <P> Is it just that the victims are yellow, not black? Or that a communist nation  is the barbaric terrorist? Or that it is a large nation?  </P> <P> Or, God forbid, because, for a morally-bankrupt government and a hypocritical  American population, a concern for profits comes first?  </P> <P> DANIEL M. SKLAR  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

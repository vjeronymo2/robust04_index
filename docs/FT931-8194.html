			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Thoughts of the wise men Yesterday the seven-man panel of economic advisers to the Treasury made its first report. The main points were: Recovery prospects Greatly improved as a result of sterling's exit from the European exchange rate mechanism. But much uncertainty about output strength this year, with average forecast of 1.1 per cent growth in 1993. Risks to upturn None of the panel expects a strong upturn in world economy, with a risk that a big contraction in Europe could depress UK exports. Interest rates Gavyn Davies and Patrick Minford want further cuts from 6 per cent soon. The other five members would reduce credit rates only if the economy weakens or sterling appreciates, or in response to changes in money supply. Taxes Tim Congdon wants Budget announcement of tax rise in 1993-94 to demonstrate commitment to tight finances. The others say tax rises in 1993 would harm a recovery though they might be needed later. Credit growth Broad money and credit growth 'may remain depressed' during this year. Panel reckons the 'lending capacity of the monetary system may be inadequate to sustain recovery'. Unemployment Likely to rise from 3m to between 3.1m to 3.4m by the end of this year. One panellist, Wynne Godley, thinks the total will climb to 3.6m by the final quarter of 1994. Current account deficit The deficit is 'very large for this stage of the cycle and for most of us this is a cause for concern'. The economists think the deficit will reach Pounds 15.5bn in both this year and 1994 after Pounds 12bn last year. Inflation Panel thinks underlying inflation (measured by the retail prices index less mortgage payments) will remain inside the Treasury's 1 per cent to 4 per cent target range over next two years. Gilts Panel wants the government to abandon full funding, allowing gilt purchases by banks and building societies to count towards financing the PSBR. That would help an upturn by boosting the money supply while also cutting long-term gilt yields. Medium-term growth Four of the seven think UK growth in the 1990s could be above its 'sustainable rate' of 2 per cent to 2.5 per cent a year. The advisers are: Wynne Godley, Patrick Minford, Tim Congdon, Andrew Britton, David Currie, Gavyn Davies and Andrew Sentance.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A fully constructive approach and complete openness  has characterized the coalition negotiations today. This was  stated by Gyula Horn at a press briefing after the talks. Ivan  Peto also said that what was achieved is very promising. The  two sides agreed on most issues. Kata Peli Nagy reports on  today's coalition negotiations.    [Begin Peto recording] What is behind us suggests a very  promising and effective negotiation process over the coming  days. We thought virtually identically about the majority of  issues. [end recording]    [Nagy] This is how Ivan Peto, chairman of the Alliance of  Free Demicrats [SZDSZ], and Gyula Horn, his Hungarian Socialist  Party [MSZP] counterpart, assessed briefly the first round of  government coalition negotiations this morning. [passage  omitted]    [Begin Horn recording] I must say that a fully constructive  approach and complete openness toward each other has  characterized the talks this morning, and we were able to come  to an agreement very quickly. Naturally, tough and long debates  can be expected on questions of content, but we agree -- and we  agreed on this too -- that the date for convening the National  Assembly is a firm framework for us, to which we would like to  adhere under all circumstances. [end recording]    [Nagy] This means that work in the expert committees must be  completed by 20 June. The two sides would like to conclude the  coalition agreement before 24 June. In this way there is a  chance for the new government to be formed at the end of the  month.</p>

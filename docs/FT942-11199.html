			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / International Company News: Strong US demand helps Electrolux beat forecasts Electrolux, the world's leading producer of household appliances, yesterday announced a SKr668m (Dollars 84.5m) profit after financial items for the first quarter following strong US demand and more stable conditions in Europe. The result, which compares with a SKr122m profit in the same 1993 period, beat expectations, taking the company's B share up SKr6 to SKr429. The group, which has agreed to buy AEG's household appliance division for DM730m (Dollars 427m), said operating income rose 88 per cent to SKr1.06bn from SKr563m. Sales were up 11 per cent at SKr26.6bn, helped by a 7 per cent rise in volumes and a favourable exchange rate. Electrolux said operating income had improved in both Europe and North America, helped by restructuring and higher demand for household appliances. However, it stressed that the European recovery was patchy, with stronger performances in the UK, Spain and the Nordic region offset by weakness in Germany, France and Italy. Household appliances saw sales rise to SKr15.0bn from SKr13.8bn. Operating income for white goods was 'substantially' higher in both Europe and the US. Results from air conditioners, floor-care, sewing machines and compressors also improved. The improvement was flattered by the company's difficulties last year in its North American and Spanish markets. Restructuring and one-off charges reduced household appliance income by SKr300m in the first quarter of 1993. Commercial appliances had a more difficult quarter, with sales rising marginally to SKr2.30bn from SKr2.29bn and operating income remaining static. Refrigeration and cleaning equipment both reported lower operating income, but industrial laundry equipment improved its result. Outdoor products increased operating income as sales rose to SKr4.25bn from SKr3.95bn; there was also a better performance from industrial products where sales climbed to SKr5.05bn from SKr3.96bn. Group net financial expenses fell to SKr391m from SKr441m, due to lower interest rates and a reduction in tied-up capital. Mr Leif Johansson, group president, said the group would concentrate on increasing operating margins and boosting its market position in 1994.</p>

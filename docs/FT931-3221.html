			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading THE ABSENCE from the Budget speech of encouragement for hopes of a cut in UK base rates brought a sudden retreat in the futures, towards the close of a dull and featureless session in the derivatives market, writes Joel Kibazo. The March contract on the FT-SE started strongly at 2,929, up 8 from its close on Monday, and moved swiftly forward to reach the day's high of 2,935 within half-an-hour of the opening. There was, however, no fol-low-through buying as both leading institutions and independent traders remained on the sidelines awaiting the outcome of the Budget. This caused March to drift lower to trade around the 2,925 mark for the next few hours. It was the lack of any signs of a reduction in base rates that led to a sharp decline in March around 20 minutes before the official close, leaving it to test the 2,900 level. It proved to be a resistance point and the contract bounced to finish at 2,909, a 4-point discount to the underlying cash market, with turnover reaching a meagre 6,936 lots. Further dealings in after-hours' trading, however, saw the contract drop through the 2,900 barrier. There was very little action in the traded options and volume was only 23,072 contracts. Some 8,406 lots were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option and 2,386 in the Euro FT-SE 100 option. Amstrad was the busiest stock option with 2,001 lots traded.</p>

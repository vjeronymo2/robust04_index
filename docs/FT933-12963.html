			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Rallying technology issues aid general tone Wall Street A REVIVAL in the technology sector helped Wall Street to move higher yesterday after posting early losses, writes Karen Zagor in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished a net 9.50 ahead at 3,544.78 after falling more than 17 points initially. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained 1.28 at 447.31, while the Nasdaq composite advanced 6.07 to 701.90. Trading volume on the New York SE amounted to 277m shares. Stocks lost ground at the outset after Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, said inflation was disappointing this year. Although the major indices had turned higher by midsession, overall market sentiment was mixed and, on the big board, declining shares outnumbered those rising by 1,054 to 866. Most of yesterday's share price movements were tied to quarterly results announcements. Sears Roebuck, the Chicago-based retailer, jumped Dollars 4 1/8 to Dollars 50 1/8 on the back of second-quarter earnings of Dollars 1.51 a share, excluding special gains. A year ago the company earned 85 cents a share. Merck, the world's biggest drugs group, firmed Dollars 1 to Dollars 33 1/8 . The company posted operating income of 61 cents a share, up from 56 cents, and said it would cut 2,100 jobs this year, against a previously announced figure of 1,000. A number of big US banks posted better credit quality and strong foreign and other trading profits. In spite of improved results, Citicorp eased Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 31 3/4 , Nationsbank slipped Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 49 and Chemical Bank held steady at Dollars 39 3/4 . In Nasdaq trading, the technology sector turned higher after several days of being battered by Apple Computer's weak third-quarter performance. Shares in Apple, which have fallen sharply since late last week, put on Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 26 7/8 . The sector picked up after BMC Software unveiled strong first-quarter earnings late on Monday. BMC forged ahead Dollars 5 5/8 to Dollars 56 1/8 . Also in the sector, Microsoft rose Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 80 1/2 , Intel Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 52 and Lotus Development Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 37 3/8 . IBM, however, slipped Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 42 7/8 in New York SE trading, reflecting investor concern about the company's dividend and the fear of more restructuring charges. Canada TORONTO closed mixed after fairly heavy trading. The TSE 300 index finished a modest 8.4 up at 3,876.1 but declining issues outscored advances by 382 to 339. Volume totalled 57.9m shares, up from Monday's 48.2m, and trading value rose to CDollars 587m. Eight of the 14 sub-indices closed higher, led by conglomerates, up 2.0 per cent.</p>

			<p><P> June 5, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH;  </P> <P> MOBILE HOME RENT ISSUE UP FOR ACTION  </P> <P> Unable to persuade owners of the city's three mobile home parks to agree on a  uniform rent increase, the Laguna Beach City Council will decide tonight  whether to lift a moratorium which has frozen rents since December.  </P> <P> The council voted May 1 to accept a plan from the owners of Treasure Island  Mobile Home Park, which would have allowed a 7% increase for one year while  freezing rents for low-income senior citizens.  </P> <P> The rent freeze was extended to today to allow the city staff time to seek a  consensus with owners of the other two parks.  </P> <P> However, the agreement reached with Treasure Island owners was not accepted by  the city's two smaller parks. The owner of Thurston Mobile Home Park was  willing to accept a 6% increase but would not allow a special allowance for  senior citizens, while the Laguna Terrace Mobile Home Park owner agreed  verbally to increases only slightly higher than 7%, according to City Manager  Kenneth C. Frank.  </P> <P> Connie Vlasis, treasurer of Treasure Island Residents Owners Assn., said that  tenants already have received notices of 7% rent increases. "The people are  really upset," she said.  </P> <P> Vlasis said some mobile home owners at the other two parks are now upset with  Treasure Island residents, who have been by far the most vocal group about  their differences with park owners. Vlasis said her 80-year-old mother, who  lives in Laguna Terrace, probably will have to move: "It's too expensive for  her now."  </P> <P> Frank is recommending that the council approve the agreements with Treasure  Island and Thurston while negotiating "within the spirit of preventing  extraordinary increases" with Laguna Terrace. Thurston residents are expected  to receive a 6% increase in August, Frank said. LESLIE EARNEST  </P></p>

			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / The Maastricht Vote: Waverers warned against undermining PM at summit THE GOVERNMENT wants its motion carried in order to strengthen Mr John Major's negotiating position at December's European summit in Edinburgh. Cabinet ministers warn wavering colleagues sotto voce that the prime minister's credibility in Europe may be at stake. Mr Major warns of the loss of inward investment and of a collapse in economic confidence in the UK if Maastricht's ratification is hindered. THE TORY LOYALISTS remain the largest part of the Conservative party. Those who have few qualms about Maastricht, or welcome it, are likely to be joined by opponents who will nevertheless vote with government. Some of the latter have been persuaded by appeals to loyalty. Others - including some junior ministers and parliamentary private secretaries - will decide that today is the wrong time to rebel. THE HARD-LINE REBELS vary from the long-standing opponents of the EC to those who believe, like former prime minister Baroness Thatcher, that Maastricht is a treaty too far, commits Britain to a federal destination and has to be blocked. What unites them is a determination not to be swayed by government lobbying. They put defeat of Maastricht as a higher priority than saving Mr Major. THE SOFT REBELS are more easily persuadable about Maastricht's contents and more susceptible to assurances from cabinet ministers that it does not, for instance, commit Britain to an early return to the ERM. Their instinct is to put off ratification on Maastricht - arguing that, far from weakening Mr Major's hand at Edinburgh - it will actually persuade other European countries that there is a British, as well as a Danish 'problem'. LABOUR says it backs closer European union but argues that today's debate is about confidence in Mr Major. The Labour leadership feels its job is to oppose the government, whatever its own thinking, and to exploit opportunities to weaken or embarrass ministers. More practically, with numerous opponents to Maastricht within Labour's ranks, a decision to oppose the government is the easiest way to ensure the party is united. THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS argue that the future of Europe should be above domestic politics and will back the government motion. They join ministers in warning of the economic consequences of the government motion's being defeated. They also reject Labour's call for a delay before Maastricht is considered by MPs. But Mr Nick Harvey, Liberal Democrat MP for Devon North, is expected to vote against the government. THE OTHERS: of the 24 MPs from the smaller parties, the nine Ulster Unionist MPs oppose Maastricht but may yet abstain. The three Democratic Unionist party MPs are also likely to vote against the government, as are the four MPs of Northern Ireland's Social Democratic and Labour party, the three Scottish Nationalist party and four Plaid Cymru MPs. The lone Ulster Popular Unionist party MP is likely to support the government.</p>

			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / The Edinburgh Summit: How ceiling fell in on UK presidency MOST countries occupying the rotating presidency of the EC suffer abuse from their partners; but this year the British have been in a league of their own. Over the past five months, UK ministers have been accused of arrogance, ignorance and sabotage by their European colleagues; the Foreign Office  - often viewed in Brussels as the most gifted in Europe - finds itself accused of unprecedented partisanship. The presidency, says one EC observer, is like a 'Rolls-Royce without a steering wheel'. Final judgment must await the outcome of the summit. Yet even a success at Edinburgh will not dispel the question: why has a presidency which was launched with such high hopes on July 1 attracted such widespread abuse? There is a respectable argument that Britain has been turned into a 'whipping boy' for all the Community's problems. One anglophile ambassador in Brussels sums up: 'Number one, Britain did not reject the Maastricht treaty like Denmark; number two, it did not call an unnecessary referendum in France, like President Mitterrand; number three, it did not cause the September crisis in the exchange rate mechanism; and number four it did not cause the recession.' Others agree that the slowdown in growth has punctured the EC's self-confidence and weakened political leaders across the continent. However tempting it is to paint Britain as a victim of events, other factors have damaged its cause in Europe. By far the most serious is Britain's delay in ratifying the Maastricht treaty. After the razor-thin French approval on September 20, EC leaders thought they had won a solid commitment from Mr John Major at the Birmingham summit the following month to press ahead with ratification. His subsequent concession to a handful of Tory Euro-sceptics to link final ratification of the treaty to a second Danish referendum was greeted, in the words of an EC ambassador, 'with total disbelief'. Mr Major's decision - which was not discussed beforehand with his foreign secretary, Mr Douglas Hurd - left the British delegation to the EC in Brussels 'shell-shocked', a UK official recalls. Only days before, British diplomats had been spreading the word that Mr Major had full cabinet support for early ratification. 'Major's U-turn destroyed his credibility,' says an EC diplomat. 'We asked ourselves: how can we believe what he says?' Some, like Chancellor Helmut Kohl, were more charitable. They accepted the prime minister's argument that the three-vote margin in the House of Commons showed how perilously close the government had come to defeat. Others such as Mr Felipe Gonzalez, Spain's premier, refused to accept the argument that it was better to make the concession than lose the treaty. The ratification delay rekindled mistrust in EC capitals about Britain's attitude to Maastricht, and the Community. Minor instances of ministerial friction have suddenly become legendary examples of British perfidy. Last month, Mr Edward Leigh, UK industry minister, unwisely refused to support calls for further discussion of plans to spend EC money on high-definition television. He was immediately accused of sabotage by the Dutch, traditionally Britain's closest ally. Mr Leigh, it appears, forgot about The Hague's eagerness to help Dutch companies such as Philips profit from EC funding. Sir John Cope, UK Paymaster General, is the latest bete noire. His brusque rejection of the European parliament's additions to EC spending drew howls of outrage; so did his peevish refusal to countenance any serious discussion on the British budget rebate. Similarly, EC finance ministers and central bank governors have yet to forgive Mr Norman Lamont, UK chancellor of the Exchequer, for using the presidency for his own ends to press Germany to cut interest rates. He encouraged colleagues to 'gang up' on the Germans at a finance ministers' meeting in early September. Lastly, both diplomats and officials at the European Commission have been infuriated by the blizzard of paper emanating from Whitehall which has tried systematically to downgrade the Commission's role. One EC diplomat describes British resolutions (statements of policy) on matters such as state aid and subsidiarity (devolving decision-making) as betraying the old habit of running everything from London. In the past three weeks, the presidency appears to have learnt some lessons. The UK paper on Denmark's requests for exemptions on the Maastricht treaty drew heavily on Mr Jean-Claude Piris, the European Council's chief legal adviser. Suspicion that the British would produce a 'soft' paper encouraging the Danes gave way to mild surprise. If Mr Major can secure deals on the Danish question and the EC budget, he would confound his critics. But hopes that 1992 would see a shift in Britain's ambivalence toward the Community have proved unrealistic. Things might have been easier for Mr Major and the Foreign Office if they had avoided such suggestions in the first place.</p>

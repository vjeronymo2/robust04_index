Al-Qadhdhafi  informed the Arab League's secretary general that the  Secretariat of the General People's Committee for Unity was in  the process of submitting a proposal on withdrawing Libya from  the Arab League to people's congresses since the League had  failed to offer anything to Arab peoples.    Member states of the League have participated in  implementing  a resolution, issued by the crusader enemy, on a blockade of the  people of the Great Jamahiriyah. The League has even been  unable to amend its Charter and bring about Arab union, and it  has not changed the Arab map while the map of the world had  changed.    The Arab League has not been able to change its stance and  has failed to resolve the Somalian crisis which was left to  Christian countries. It has also failed to resolve the Yemeni  problem, so much so that the U.S. President has started to issue  orders to Yemeni forces to retreat to their barracks. It has  also failed to do anything for the Lebanese Arab people and  their occupied land, the Syrian Arab people and their occupied  territories, and the annihilation of the Palestinian people. It  has failed to make member countries respect its Charters; the  joint defense pact was not applied during the attacks on Libya,  Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, and Tunisia.    All of that was followed by the completion of the  destruction  of the League's Charter, resumption of relations with the enemy,  and the lifting of the boycott when some members of the League  announced that they would supply the enemy with energy and some  have hosted and met the enemy's leaders. The Arab League has  also failed to bring about a reconciliation among some Arabs:  We could see Arabs and their enemies embracing, while the Arabs  refused to meet each other. What is taking place is the Arabs'  submission to U.S. and Israeli force that is imposed on them and  the Arabs' unconditional surrender.    The Arabs have failed in international gatherings and the  League has not succeeded in imposing a blockade on the Israelis,  banning arms sales to them, and severing relations with them,  while that is being applied against Arabs; they are being  disarmed and banned from obtaining arms, as is the case with  Libya and Iraq.    Therefore, the Libyan people are seriously thinking about  leaving the Arab League so that Arabs will be able to welcome  their brother Israel. On the basis of the communique submitted  by the Secretariat of the General People's Committee for Unity  to the Arab League, the League's secretary general urgently  contacted the the brother leader of the revolution.    [Begin recording] ['Abd al-Majid] Your Excellency Colonel, I  am Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid.    [Al-Qadhdhafi] Yes [words indistinct].    ['Abd-al-Majid] Seasons greetings.    [Al-Qadhdhafi] Good wishes.    ['Abd-al-Majid] God willing, you are well.    [Al-Qadhdhafi] Well, thanks to God. How are you?    ['Abd-al-Majid] Your Excellency Colonel, Unity Secretary  brother Jum'ah al-Fazzani, and brother... [end recording,  interrupted by announcer]    'Abd-al-Majid asks him not to submit the issue to the  people's congresses in the Great Jamahiriyah until a meeting  between Libya and the Arab League takes place.    [Begin recording] ['Abd-al-Majid] I would like to see you  and  talk about it before you make a decision.    [Al-Qadhdhafi] We appreciate your personal efforts and your  loyalty to this nation. You are a brother to us. However, on  the whole the Arab situation is like this.    ['Abd-al-Majid] I know. He [not further identified] told me  about the letter and the cable Your Excellency sent. This came  at the right time.    [Al-Qadhdhafi] My brother, Israelis and Arabs are embracing  each other while Arabs are not meeting each other. This does  not make sense. Does it make sense that we embrace our bitter  enemy every day, while the Arabs are not meeting each other?    ['Abd-al-Majid] That is right.    [Al-Qadhdhafi] It is a scandal that Christians and the West  go to Somalia, an Arab country, to solve its problems. Yemen is  a member of the Arab League and an Arab country. Now there are  military concentrations, and the U.S. President is saying that  the military units have to return to their barracks. Muscat is  inviting the foreign minister... [end recording, interrupted by  announcer]    Brothers, that was the secretary general of the Arab League  urgently contacting the brother leader of the revolution  following the arrival of the secretary of the General People's  Committee for Unity in Cairo, who has informed the Arab League  secretary general that the Secretariat of the General People's  Committee for Unity is about to submit a proposal on Libya's  withdrawal from the League to peoples' congresses after the  League's failure to offer anything to Arab people.</p>

			<p><P> June 19, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA;  </P> <P> BEACH RESTROOMS TO CLOSE TO SAVE WATER  </P> <P> A majority of the restrooms and some showers at San Buenaventura State Beach  will be closed weekdays under a plan to conserve water during Ventura's drought  emergency.  </P> <P> Park officials hope to save up to 4,000 gallons of water a day by closing the  facilities, a step they say is necessary to meet Ventura's mandatory 20%  reduction in water use.  </P> <P> Beginning this week, three of the five restrooms at the popular state beach  will be closed during off-peak hours, said Walt Deleu, chief maintenance  supervisor for the Channel Coast District. Four of the beach's eight outdoor  cold showers will also be turned off to conserve water, he said.  </P> <P> Chemical toilets will be installed outside the closed facilities and signs will  be posted nearby directing beach-goers to the nearest open restrooms and  showers, Deleu said.  </P> <P> The bathrooms and showers will be reopened on weekends and on days when there  are many visitors to the beach, Deleu said.  </P> <P> "We're going to be very flexible with this," Deleu said.  </P> <P> Similar restrictions are being considered for Emma Wood State Beach, where a  15% reduction in water use has been achieved by limiting landscape watering,  Deleu said.  </P> <P> The full contingent of bathroom and hot-shower facilities will remain open at  Carpinteria and McGrath state beaches, where the installation of a pay shower  system has led to a 20% reduction in water use.

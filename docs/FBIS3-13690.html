The root causes of this conflict are so complex  that numerous previous initiatives have failed to arrive at a  peaceful settlement. We must not allow that to happen again, but  let us all give peace a chance.    Meanwhile, the long drawn out conflict has cost thousands of  lives and led to immeasurable suffering for many more. I have  always held the view that we in Africa must not remain passive  and wait for outsiders to seek solutions for problems within our  continent. Brothers: We ourselves should take an active role  in finding solutions to problems in our continent whether they  are political, military, economic or social. [Word indistinct]  (?let) all of us assembled here today reiterate our commitment  to the noble but difficult task of searching for a peaceful  resolution to the conflict. Finally and out of this initiative  let peace come to the Sudan."    At the end the meeting, a statement was released and read by  Kenya's minister for foreign affairs and international  cooperation, Mr. Kalonzo Musyoka:    [Musyoka] "The IGADD committee met with His Excellency  General 'Umar Hasan al-Bashir, president of the republic of the  Sudan, and subsequently met the leaders of the two SPLM/SPLA  factions, Dr. John Garang and Dr. Riak Machar, and conducted  intensive consultations within itself and the parties concerned  and agreed to launch the IGADD peace talks on the Sudan. The  committee and the parties to the conflict agreed that pursuant  to the mandate given by the meeting of the IGADD summit held in  Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on 6th and 7th September 1993, the  negotiations shall take into consideration the previous efforts  in search of a solution to the conflict, namely talks held in  August 1989 in Addis Ababa, December 1989 in Nairobi, May-June  1992 and April-May 1993 in Abuja and May 1993 in Nairobi.    The committee expressed serious concern at the continued  human suffering, misery, famine and disease in the war-affected  areas. It was agreed that the parties to the conflict shall  allow access to relief agencies to ensure that relief assistance  is delivered to suffering people in those areas. The committee  also expressed deep concern that the long-drawn [out] conflict  was a threat to peace and security in the sub-region.    In reference to the stated commitment to the IGADD peace  initiative, including their readiness to immediately embark on  negotiations, the parties to the conflict agreed to send to the  peace talks high-level delegations with full mandates to  negotiate.    The committee called upon the parties concerned to the  conflict to exercise restraint and desist from escalating  hostilities, including actions that might jeopardize the IGADD  initiative, in order to create a conducive atmosphere for  conduct of negotiations.    The IGADD committee decided the standing committee of  ministers of foreign affairs shall conduct the peace  negotiations under the supervision of the chairman of the IGADD  committee and directed the standing committee to start the  negotiating process immediately. The IGADD committee further  appealed to the international community to continue supporting  the initiative. I thank you Your Excellencies."</p>

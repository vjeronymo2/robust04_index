			<p><P> September 12, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Treasury Bill Rates Fall: The Treasury sold $7.2 billion of new three-month  bills at an average discount rate of 7.64%, down from 7.88% last week. Another  $7.2 billion of new six-month bills was sold at an average discount rate of  7.64%, down from 7.87% last week. The rates were the lowest since three-month  bills sold for 7.54% on Nov. 7, and six-month bills averaged 7.35% on July 31.  The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors -- 7.9% for  three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill selling for $9,806.90 and 8.06% for a  six-month bill selling for $9,613.80. The discount rate reflects the price  discount received when government securities are purchased at less than face  value.  </P></p>

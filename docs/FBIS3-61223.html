The face value of the property privatized is US $4.424 million.    Lithuania will continue to follow the present model of  privatization for hard currency; it is slower but more  profitable, said Arvydas Darulis, head of the Economics  Ministry's Privatization Department. A new, accelerated  privatization method, slightly resembling the Estonian one, will  be tested in Lithuania in the near future, he said. The so  called Fast-Track privatization plan is currently under  preparation in collaboration with consultants from the EC PHARE  program and the international consortium Roland Berger and  Partner GmbH.    According to the program, ten to twenty strategically  insignificant enterprises will be chosen for privatization and  presented in a single list. The list is most likely to include  several hotels, restaurants, huge shops and small industrial  companies. The terms of privatization contests will be much more  liberal compared to the present ones which limit participation  of foreigners. Mr. Darulis noted greatest advantage the fact is  of the program that foreigners will be able to privatize  property fast and without any major hindrances. The method is  expected to attract more foreign investments.</p>

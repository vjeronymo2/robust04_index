			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev -- On 20 May in an interview with a UNIAN  correspondent, Valentyn Landyk, deputy prime minister of Ukraine  and people's deputy, announced he had written a statement today  requesting that his resignation as deputy prime minister of  Ukraine be accepted in connection with his election as people's  deputy. He sent the letter to Ukraine's president. He said: "I  have decided to work in parliament and no longer wish to take  the blame."    In his opinion, next week Leonid Kravchuk will probably  propose a candidate for the post of prime minister of Ukraine  for parliamentary approval.</p>

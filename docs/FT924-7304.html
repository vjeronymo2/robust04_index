			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / International Company News: Fay, Richwhite to pay bonus on BNZ stake sale FAY, Richwhite, the New Zealand merchant bank, is to pay shareholders NZDollars 40m (USDollars 21m) as a tax free special dividend to mark the successful sale of its 23 per cent holding in the Bank of New Zealand (BNZ). Sir Michael Fay, joint managing director, told the annual meeting in Auckland that the company would pay a special dividend of 12 cents a share with the final dividend of 2 cents a share on December 4. He said that following the sale of BNZ to National Australia Bank (NAB) last week, Fay, Richwhite had around NZDollars 40m of liquid shareholders' funds in excess of maximum requirements. The directors felt that the payment of a special dividend was appropriate. Sir Michael said that in a business and banking environment in which there was a preference for single purpose companies, it was Fay, Richwhite's intention to remain focused solely on merchant banking and to refrain from any strategy which confused the business with that of an investment company. The company's working capital would be used only for trading purposes, with surplus funds returned to shareholders. The sale of BNZ, which netted Fay, Richwhite NZDollars 389m, had enabled the company to retire all its core debt, which would lead to a substantial reduction in interest costs and improve cash flow. The sale would also lead to a significant improvement in the quality of earnings. Fay, Richwhite shares rose 5 cents to 82 cents on the New Zealand Stock Exchange yesterday afternoon before the announcement. Earlier this year the shares hit a low of 52 cents, but reached NZDollars 1.20 during the America's Cup yachting challenge, when Sir Michael Fay was the main backer for the New Zealand entry.</p>

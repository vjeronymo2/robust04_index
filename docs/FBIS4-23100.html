			<p>The      Palestinian Television Network aired its first test broadcast  from Jericho on 6 June and reportedly intends to televise Yasir  'Arafat's arrival later this month.  The trial broadcast, which  featured the Palestinian Broadcasting Corporation (PBC) logo  accompanied by its name and a Palestinian flag, was reported by  Sanaa Voice of Palestine as well as Jordanian and Israeli radio on 7  June.  An AFP report from the same day said that transmission of the  broadcast, which covered only Jericho, was weak, and attributed this  in part to Jericho's location well below sea level.  The head of  PBC, Radwan Abu-'Ayyash, told Radio Jordan that he hopes that the  television transmissions will soon cover the entire West Bank and  Gaza Strip.  He added that Palestinian radio will begin  broadcasting four to eight hours per day to Jericho and Gaza by late  June.      The Palestinian test broadcast was made from a Jericho hotel  which has been turned into a press center in preparation for  'Arafat's visit, and which will continue to operate as a permanent  broadcasting center, according to the AFP report.  PBC head Abu-  'Ayyash stated: "Our plan was to have a main studio in Ramallah,  connected with one in Gaza and one in Jericho.  Because we have no  other choice, we will transmit from Jericho, although it is terrible  from such a low area. "  He said that two French-made boosting  towers will be placed on a nearby mountain and highway.  Technicians  have promised that transmissions to the rest of the West Bank and  Gaza Strip will be ready within a week.      AFP quotes Abu-'Ayyash as saying that the primary obstacle to  Palestinian broadcasting is a lack of funds.  He said that $55  million is needed to establish a permanent radio and TV broadcasting  center.  Most of this has been promised by the European Union, he  noted, but "the money is locked up in Brussels" and has yet to  arrive.  The test broadcast was made from a temporary mobile  transmission station, according to Abu-'Ayyash, because the  Palestinian authority has not yet received equipment promised by  donors.  A dispute with Israel over the location of the broadcasting  center has also caused delays.  On 5 June, Abu-'Ayyash told AFP that  Israel had informed the Palestinian authority that they must set up  their broadcasting facilities in Jericho.  The PBC had intended to  set up their studios in Ramallah, where a pre-1967 transmitter and  radio masts are being renovated.  "Now we cannot have the studios in  Ramallah," said Abu-Ayyash. "The town is not part of the autonomous  areas."

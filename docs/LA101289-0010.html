			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SOVIET ARTS FESTIVAL;  </P> <P> TOURISTS MAY BE THE TRAPS, FBI WARNS  </P> <P> As city officials open their arms to the largest number of Soviet tourists ever  to visit San Diego, FBI officials are shaking their heads and urging caution.  </P> <P> In an unusual public appeal, the bureau is warning San Diegans that their  contacts with visiting Russians may be used by "skilled intelligence officers"  for espionage.  </P> <P> "Every San Diego citizen should be a good host to visitors but should also be  alert. If activity is observed which appears to be outside the normal tourist  activity, the FBI should be contacted," according to an FBI statement prepared  for a news conference this morning.  </P> <P> During the next two weeks alone, more than 300 Russians will arrive for San  Diego's Soviet arts festival, which begins Oct. 21. City officials say they are  making every effort to welcome the visitors, but the FBI warns that spies could  easily prowl the city, using the festival hoopla to veil their activities and  dupe unwitting citizens into revealing more than they ought. FBI officials  point to 13 proven cases of espionage in the past three years that have  blemished the nation's security.  </P> <P> During 1987, the U. S. State Department granted 12,000 Soviet tourist visas  nationwide. In 1988, the number jumped to 27,500, and this year officials  estimate that the number will increase to more than 60,000 visas.  </P> <P> "The increase in visitors coming to San Diego is proportionately similar," the  FBI statement says.  </P> <P> FBI officials declined to comment on the statement, saying they will discuss it  in greater detail at today's news conference.  </P> <P> "This increased contact between San Diego residents and Soviet citizens is both  good and bad," the statement says. "There is, however, the possibility that  these contacts will be used by skilled intelligence officers for other  purposes. Experience shows such has occurred in the past, and wisdom suggests  it will happen in the future."  </P> <P> City officials say residents have responded to the Soviet visitors with  hospitality. Some have offered their homes; others said they would cook  dinners. More than 100,000 tickets to the festival have already been sold.  </P> <P> Mayor Maureen O'Connor, the leading proponent of the festival, could not be  reached for comment Wednesday. Her spokesman, Paul Downey, said: "We really  don't see any problems at all; we are doing this with the total blessing of the  U.S. government. From our standpoint, everybody who is coming from the Soviet  Union is connected with the arts. I think everybody coming is who they say they  are."  </P> <P> Local military officials declined to discuss whether they will increase  security, as the FBI is doing.  </P> <P> "The military is not going to change its posture," said Cmdr. Doug Schamp, a  Navy spokesman. "If the Soviet Union wanted to get someone to San Diego, it's  not impossible, and they don't need a festival to do it."  </P> <P> As the warmth of glasnost trickles down to the military, officials are sending  mixed signals. Although they now welcome top-ranking Soviet officials --  including the Soviet defense minister -- to visit local military bases, they  are admonished not to be overly friendly. Since 1988, all Navy personnel have  been required to report "any form of contact, intentional or unintentional"  with anyone from a list of designated countries, which includes the Soviet  Union, China, Cambodia, Iran, Romania and Albania.  </P> <P> Agents at the Naval Investigative Services in Washington have warned officers  to watch for unusual signs among personnel such as "unexplained affluence,  exotic vacations, things out of the ordinary like working late and excessive  amounts of time spent copying things," according to the Navy Times.  </P> <P> The NIS recently set up a nationwide espionage hot line for Navy personnel to  call if they suspect espionage. (The number is 1-800-543-NAVY.) And, to raise  sensitivity to the spy-threat, it has issued a 36-page booklet titled  "Espionage." The booklet's cover consists of photographs of Navy personnel who  were convicted on espionage charges from 1962 to 1989.  </P></p>

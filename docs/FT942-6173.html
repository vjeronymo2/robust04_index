			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / Change to Tec funding 'threatens training' Hundreds of young people may be offered unsuitable training as a result of a new funding regime being imposed by the government on training and enterprise councils, which administer publicly funded training in England and Wales. The government has told Tecs that after 1997 it will contract only with those meeting stringent targets for delivering the government's guarantee of a training place for all young people who want one. Mr Chris Humphries, director of policy and strategy at the Tec National Council, which represents the 82 Tecs in England and Wales, said: 'Tecs agree with the principle of the guarantee. But if one pushes too hard there is a danger that young people could end up in unsuitable training.' Both Tecs and the Careers Service, which refers young people to Tecs for training places, also fear the new rules will tempt Tecs to collude with the service to massage the figures so that the guarantee appears to be delivered. The move comes amid a political row about homeless young people. In spite of the guarantee, it is estimated that there are thousands of young people not on the Youth Training scheme, but without jobs or benefits. Many already reject offers of a place on YT because the places offered are not what they want. Meeting the guarantee, which involves a Tec making an offer of a YT place within eight weeks, will be an 'absolute requirement' said the Department of Employment. Last week the department published details of the contract it will be offering the Tecs. The new rules are designed to prevent a repetition of the government's embarrassment two years ago when the Labour party made political capital out of the fact that the guarantee had not been met for many young people. The department then put considerable pressure on Tecs to find places. They in turn have put pressure on the Careers Service, which is responsible for monitoring whether an offer has been made and reporting this back to the department. The strategy has been successful in that a year ago more than 5,000 young people had to wait more than eight weeks for an offer of a place. The official figure is currently 157. Many Tecs fear they might not meet the new criteria. Tecs will be considered for licensing only if fewer than two people per thousand in their client group are waiting for a place after eight weeks during a six-month monitoring period. One careers officer said: 'Clearly it is important for Tecs to bring the figures down. It is not as easy as it sounds, and the returns we make are open to interpretation. 'A person may have a training place lined up, but may have to wait nine weeks. Technically, the guarantee is not being met. Also, the guarantee is about an offer of a place. 'The Careers Service may not think some offers made by the Tec are suitable. But it may not wish to argue with the Tec when it is trying to work in partnership with it.'</p>

			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / International Company News: Turner TV empire drops 30% in final term TURNER Broadcasting System (TBS), the Atlanta-based cable television empire controlled by Mr Ted Turner, yesterday reported a 30 per cent decline in net profits for the last three months of 1992, to Dollars 30m. Revenues in the 1992 fourth quarter rose to Dollars 538m from Dollars 402m a year before. The company's full-year net income fell to Dollars 78m from Dollars 86m in 1991. Consolidated revenues for the whole of 1992 were 20 per cent higher at Dollars 1.77bn, while operating profits for the year declined slightly, to Dollars 289m from Dollars 297m in 1991. TBS attributed the fall to special charges associated with the termination of operations for the Checkout Channel, a cable service used in supermarkets. Without this charge TBS said operating profit for the whole of last year would have risen by 3 per cent to Dollars 305m, while net profits for 1992 would have been Dollars 94m. The operating profit of CNN, Headline News and CNN International, the news channels, rose by 8 per cent in 1992, but the news division suffered an overall fall of 8 per cent to Dollars 155m because of the Checkout Channel charges. Revenues in the news division were 12 per cent higher at Dollars 536m. Operating profit for 1992 in the entertainment division was Dollars 176m, an 11 per cent rise over the previous year. Revenues in the division were 19 per cent better at Dollars 847m for the 12-month period. Syndication and licensing revenues were 35 per cent improved in 1992 at Dollars 259m, thanks largely to home video and theatrical revenues. However, the division suffered a Dollars 15.7m loss, more than double the 1991 loss of Dollars 5.5m. The sports division produced Dollars 11.2m of operating profits, up from Dollars 2.3m in 1991. Sports revenues were Dollars 83.3m last year, compared to Dollars 53.2m in 1991.</p>

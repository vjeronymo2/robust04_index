			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Kenya plans for polls 'favour' Moi KENYA'S plans for its first multi-party elections since independence in 1963 are 'seriously flawed' and may be tilted in favour of President Daniel arap Moi, according to a report issued yesterday by the International Human Rights Law Group, Reuter reports from Washington. The Washington-based organisation said President Moi's government has shown its willingness to use its powers to influence the outcome of the voting, scheduled for December 29. President Moi, under pressure from domestic groups and countries providing aid, agreed to the elections last December. The rights group's fact-finding team, made up of representatives from Britain, Chile and Denmark praised the openness of political discussion, but found a number of problems. Opposition parties, the report said, had been denied access to government television and radio and had trouble organising campaign rallies. Some parties were unable to register, the report added, citing the government's refusal to let the Islamic Party of Kenya and the Green Party to take part. The representatives said that with about a month before the elections, the Electoral Commission, had yet to decide on the number of polling places and the logistics and systems to be used for polling.</p>

			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Tories urge aid for pensioners: Maxwell campaigners call on institutions to establish fund to maintain payments SIX senior Tory MPs are putting pressure on banks and other financial institutions that dealt with the late Mr Robert Maxwell, saying they have a moral obligation to ensure that all Maxwell pensioners continue to receive their pensions. Mr Maxwell is thought to have siphoned Pounds 900m from pension funds, public companies and banks, recycling most of it to other banks. The campaign by the Conservative backbenchers urging institutions involved in the Maxwell affair to set up a fund to maintain payments to the pensioners will gather momentum next week when MPs meet some of the companies. The move follows yesterday's tabling of a parliamentary early day motion advocating such a fund by six senior Tories, headed by Mr Spencer Batiste, the MP for Elmet, near Leeds. The motion says financial institutions that were 'unwise' enough to have dealings with the late tycoon have 'a moral obligation' to ensure that Maxwell pensioners continue to receive their pensions. Setting up a fund to maintain payments until ownership of the main assets had been established would be 'without prejudice' to the institutions' legal claims. The attempt to enlist private-sector help follows failure to gain government commitments of financial support. Ms Ann Widdecombe, a junior social security minister, has said it would be premature for the government to commit itself to any action. On Tuesday Mr Richard Page, Conservative MP for Hertfordshire South-West, and Mr Frank Field, Labour chairman of the social security committee in the last parliament, are to meet Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, to argue that the government should seek ways of keeping pension funds open until investigations into the state of the Maxwell funds are complete. Mr Batiste said: 'My impression is that at the end of the day there will be a legal settlement involving financial institutions coughing up a fair amount.' It would be wrong for the government, which appeared to have no liability, to 'come forward and let those with liabilities off the hook'. He admits to a strong interest as '240-odd' Maxwell pensioners whose payments have been stopped live in Leeds.</p>

			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Russians urged to study capitalism A CALL for the first coherent and co-ordinated system to educate the Russian workforce in the basics of capitalism was made to the government yesterday. A report by a commission of Russian and western experts urges short courses across a range of disciplines  - banking, insurance, commercial law, marketing, office skills, business management and government economic management. It says existing courses and teaching materials are of a low quality, haphazard and have no national standards. The report warns that 'millions of adults will need to change their activity and occupation', that 'Russians have no idea of the market economy' and that 'virtually the entire Russian legal profession requires retraining'. The authors revealed yesterday the scale of the changes demanded; 800,000 civil servants require instruction in the basics of the market economy and more than 1m accountants need retraining. Professor Arkady Manukovsky, of the School of International Business and one of the report's authors, said training in the new economics must be geared to the specific conditions of the Russian economy  - including the 'illegality or semi-legality of much Russian commercial activity'. Mr Feodor Prokopov, first deputy labour minister, said the report represented 'the first step towards professional training in Russia'.</p>

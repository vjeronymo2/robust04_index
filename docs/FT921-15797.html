			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets: Merrill sees Dow 1992 peak of 3,400 WALL STREET'S momentum is so great, said Merrill Lynch's chief market analyst Mr Robert Farrell yesterday, that the current phase of 'urgent buying' may well last until early February, even though the US market is overvalued, writes Peter Martin. Mr Farrell, speaking in London, said that one interpretation of the current 'stampede' is that it is a 'classic blow-off' to a 15-year bull market. If that is so, the market might go up a lot but could lead to a bear market in 1993-94 rather like that seen in 1973-74. From March to November last year, the US market saw a continued strong performance from growth companies such as the biotechnology industry, which offset weakness in cyclical capital goods and technology companies. The market's recent rise has been across the board. However, Mr Farrell said that the economic conditions which favour growth stocks do not favour cyclicals, and vice versa, so 'it seems safe to assume that both groups cannot do well together in 1992 once the present stampede ends'. Changing economic conditions could lead to a better relative, and perhaps absolute, performance by cyclical stocks, he added. Such a scenario would limit the market's upside in 1992, to perhaps 3,400 on the Dow, with greater volatility than last year.</p>

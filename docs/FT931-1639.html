			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Survey of Czech Republic (8): Ideal base for exporters - Low cost of labour is main attraction for investors DIRECT foreign investment in the Czech Republic's part of the former Czechoslovakia doubled last year to reach Dollars 1.2bn, in spite of political uncertainty over the country's impending dissolution. Mr Josef Lebl, general manager of CzechInvest, the recently established foreign investment agency, believes this is a good omen for the future, and hopes 1993 will see even higher levels of investment. The US was the largest investor last year accounting for 39.5 per cent of all investments, followed by France with 20.2 per cent, and Germany which slipped into third place with 15.6 per cent. German investors, however, have taken the lion's share with just under 40 per cent of all foreign investments since 1989. The Czech Republic's main attractions for investors are its low labour costs, at less than one tenth of German wages, and the availability of skilled workers who can be easily trained. Its location in the centre of Europe also makes it an ideal base from which to export westwards and eastwards, though access to western markets is the prime consideration for investors. The country's small domestic market of 10m people is constrained by low per capita income. Prospects will depend largely on economic developments outside the Czech Republic. Local drawbacks include poor telecommunications and infrastructure, and the lack of incentives for foreign investors. Prime minister Vaclav Klaus says all investors - domestic and foreign - should be treated equally, and the Czech Republic is attractive on its own terms. Small tax advantages are available, but officials insist incentives are not the decisive issue and other factors are more important. But incentives can tip the balance when companies make their choice, and the government may be forced to change its approach in the face of strong international competition.</p>

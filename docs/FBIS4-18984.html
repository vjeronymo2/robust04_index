			<p>BFN     [Text] The Prime Minister today backed United Nations  commanders who ordered a NATO air strike against Bosnian Serbs  besieging the Muslim enclave of Gorazde. Two U.S. NATO F16 jets  bombed a Bosnian Serb artillery command post near Gorazde, a  designated "safe haven," yesterday after the Serbs ignored  repeated warnings to stop attacks on the town.    The strike was fully justified, John Major said during a  visit to Birmingham. "It makes it perfectly clear to the Serbs  or to anyone else that we are serious about making sure that  United Nations Security Council resolutions are kept," he said.    "I think the air strikes were justified -- they were  certainly within the authority which the commanders on the  ground have. They saw continued approach towards Goradze.  They saw the shelling of Goradze. The Serbs were given a clear  warning to stop. They didn't stop and I think they can be  unsurprised at the subsequent action."    Asked how much notice he was given about the air strike, Mr  Major said: "It isn't a matter of anyone being given notice.  The responsibility for this has been delegated to the  Secretary General who has delegated to the commanders on the  ground and it is for them to make the decisions, and not for the  politicians a long way away."    He went on: "The changes which we have seen in Bosnia in  the last two months have been astonishing. We have moved at a  rapid rate towards the possibility of an overall settlement now  and that is being put in danger by what has happened in Goradze.  I have not a shred of doubt that the commanders on the ground  were right to act as they did."</p>

			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Scudder trust to raise further Pounds 20m Scudder Stevens &amp; Clark, the US fund management group, has so far raised Pounds 50m with the launch of its first UK investment trust. Scudder has been an investor in Latin America for some time, and already manages 10 US funds specialising in the area. However, as the group is not familiar in the UK retail market, the Scudder Latin American Investment Trust has been marketed only to institutions. Scudder is now offering another Pounds 10m each through a further placing and intermediaries offer, closing on May 27. The fund was the fourth Latin American trust to hit the London market this year, following funds from Edinburgh Fund Managers, Morgan Grenfell, and Templeton. Mr Dan Pierce, chairman of Scudder, said the result of the launch was 'very gratifying in what have been difficult market conditions'.</p>

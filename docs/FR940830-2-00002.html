The recommendations concern the use of audited self-regulation as a regulatory technique and procedures for civil forfeiture of property or other assets. The statement presents the views of the Conference on the Social Security Administration's proposal to reengineer the disability benefits process.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Ren&eacute;e Barnow, 202&hyph;254&hyph;7020.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The Administrative Conference of the United States was established by the Administrative Conference Act, 5 U.S.C. 591&hyph;596. The Conference studies the efficiency, adequacy, and fairness of the administrative procedures used by federal agencies in carrying out administrative programs, and makes recommendations for improvements to the agencies, collectively or individually, and to the President, Congress, and the Judicial Conference of the United States (5 U.S.C. 594(1)). At its Fiftieth Plenary Session, held June 16, 1994, the Assembly of the Administrative Conference of the United States adopted two recommendations and a formal statement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Recommendation 94&hyph;1, The Use of Audited Self-Regulation as a Regulatory Technique, suggests that when certain prerequisites and safeguards are present, Congress and federal agencies should consider the possibility of delegating regulatory power to a private self-regulatory organization. The recommendation emphasizes the necessity of ensuring the effectiveness and the fairness of the process, and identifies standards for determining whether such a delegation may be appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Recommendation 94&hyph;2, Reforming the Government's Procedure for Civil Forfeiture, suggests improvements in this process. The United States Government has in recent years made increasing use of its power to confiscate the property or assets of persons involved in illegal activities through civil forfeitures. Notice of an impending administrative forfeiture is sent to the last known address of the owner and is published in newspapers. This system has been criticized as unduly expensive and ineffective. The recommendation suggests that the establishment of a centrally maintained Civil Forfeiture Registry, which would be published and made widely available, would not only provide better and more reliable notice, it would provide a better overview of the entire forfeiture process, thus improving public and congressional oversight. The recommendation also proposes that Congress impose a statutory 60-day time limit on the agency to provide notice in the Civil Forfeiture Registry and to send written notice of a seizure to the last known address of the owner or interest holder in the property.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Statement No. 17, Comments on the Social Security Administration's Proposal on Reengineering the SSA Disability Process, constitutes the formal comments from the Administrative Conference to the Social Security Administration on SSA's proposal. The Conference generally supported the proposed changes to SSA's procedures, which would reduce the number of administrative stages from four to two, while offering claimants increased opportunity for face-to-face interaction with agency staff.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The full texts of the recommendation and statement are set out in the Appendix below. The recommendations will be transmitted to the affected agencies and to appropriate committees of the United States Congress. The Administrative Conference has advisory powers only, and the decision on whether to implement the recommendations must be made by the affected agencies or by Congress.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Recommendations and statements of the Administrative Conference are published in full text in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In past years Conference recommendations and statements of continuing interest were also published in full text in the Code of Federal Regulations (1 CFR Parts 305 and 310). Budget constraints have required a suspension of this practice in 1994. However, a complete listing of past recommendations and statements is published in the Code of Federal Regulations. Copies of all past Conference  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommendations and statements, and the research reports on which they are based, may be obtained from the Office of the Chairman of the Administrative Conference. Requests for single copies of such documents will be filled without charge to the extent that supplies on hand permit (see 1 CFR &sect;304.2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The transcript of the Plenary Session is available for public inspection at the Conference's offices at Suite 500, 2120 L Street, NW, Washington, DC.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: August 22, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Jeffrey S.

This self-regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organization is often an association of regulated entities formed for the explicit purpose of self-regulation. Audited self-regulation is an alternative for Congress to consider in legislating any regulatory program. Properly implemented and monitored, a program of audited self-regulation may effectively advance the statutory objectives consistent with the public interest and the interests of the regulated entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In certain circumstances, this approach may result in better regulation because the agency's statute and rules are supplemented and enforced by those entities directly involved in the regulated activity, which may have more detailed knowledge of the operational or technical aspects of that activity. The regulatory program also may be more effective because it can be tailored to the individual industry or group. In addition, the agency's regulatory enforcement costs may be reduced by this approach, although such cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reductions should be considered only if they can be achieved without eroding the effectiveness of enforcement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

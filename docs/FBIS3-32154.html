			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with BNDES [National Bank for Economic and </F> Social Development] president Persio Arida, by Miriam Leitao and  Luiz Noronha, place and date not given; first three paragraphs  are O GLOBO introduction]    [Text] During the entire time the FH [Fernando Henrique]  Plan was being readied, economist Persio Arida remained in the  background. He said very little and was hardly ever seen in  public. On the day the plan was announced in Brasilia, he sat  discreetly in a side chair at the large table that had been set  up on the platform in the press conference room at the Ministry  of Finance.    The first journalist in line at the microphone opened the  question period. What Arida had tried to conceal was then  revealed. The other members of the economic team and the  officials seated at the table looked in his direction for the  response. Rather awkwardly, he began to answer and became the  central figure during practically the entire press conference.    At age 41, Persio Arida is, for the second time in his life,  a key player on an economic team that is involved in a  stabilization plan. The first time was during the Cruzado Plan.  Still professorial, he displays more enthusiasm when he talks  about the theoretical concept of the plan than about its  practical application. He thinks it is too early to unveil  mysteries such as, for example, whether the exchange rate  between the new currency and the dollar will be a fixed rate.  But he left no doubt on one point: the plan will cause losses,  mainly for those who have something to gain from inflation.  There is only one trick to guaranteeing this kind of plan:  "political coalition." He also explains why he is staying in  Rio, as president of the BNDES, rather than going to Brasilia.  "Privatization is an integral part of any stabilization process."    [O GLOBO] The inflation rate is rising, the money supply is  expanding, the Central Bank is having trouble selling bonds, and  everyone thinks the minister will step down in April. Is this a  good time for an economic plan?    [Persio Arida] Indeed the inflation rate has risen, but this  must be attributed to a farm products price shock. But  government paper is not being rejected; the NTN [National  Treasury Notes] auctions prove this. As for the monetary  expansion, it is a mistake that we must market bonds to shrink  the monetary base. Building up reserves will produce practically  the same effect.    [O GLOBO] So this is a good time?    [Persio Arida] A good time is when the public finances are  in  order. Now, therefore, is not really a good time. Unless the  budget and the fiscal adjustment are approved, the right moment  will not be created. That is what is most important.  Furthermore, a stabilization plan announced during a "supply  shock" will run into trouble. The third feature of a good time  is the existence of a consensus in the minds of the public and  the government about the imperatives of the stabilization.  Stabilization does not come about because of an act by the  finance minster. Any stabilization involves a net gain for  society, but it always involves losses.    [O GLOBO] How does the apprehension about Minister Fernando  Henrique's candidacy affect that coalition?    [Persio Arida] I would rather comment in greater depth on  the  political coalition. Stabilization involves far-reaching changes  in the way the economy functions. It is not something that is  applied topically. A technically well-designed program that does  not have the backing of the public has a good chance of failure.  That is why the question of the right moment, aside from the  fiscal requisite, depends essentially on magic--in the sense  that it charms, enchants, and so wins the support of society.    [O GLOBO] You mentioned losses. Are they digestible?    [Persio Arida] Every program has its costs. Since the  identified losers have a stronger lobby than the scattered  winners, the political balance is unquestionably difficult to  maintain.    [O GLOBO] The initial version of the plan called for a slow,  voluntary transition to the new currency. But no economist  believes it is possible to eliminate a 40 percent [monthly]  inflation rate this way.    [Persio Arida] The fact that contracting in URV's [Real  Value  Unit] is voluntary does not mean a drop in the inflation rate  will not cause losses. We have had high inflation rates for more  than two decades. We must assume that this inflation has deep  roots. I would be the last to say that everyone will win.    [O GLOBO] And do you think this country is mature enough to  understand this clearly?    [Persio Arida] My assessment is that our society is  maturing....    [O GLOBO] Maturing?    [Persio Arida] It is a process, it really is. Most of our  problems were inherited from the decade of the 70's, the era of  big nationalizations and regimentation of the economy. The State  was the driving force of the Brazilian capitalist system; it had  a fantastic power to choose the losers and the winners. That led  to a series of imbalances.    [O GLOBO] When you ask a businessman if he believes the plan  will turn out well, he answers that he is rooting for it. The  fans are as irrational as those at a soccer game, but the public  is not convinced that the plan can turn out well. What are the  actual chances that the plan will work?    [Persio Arida] There are lots of fans, but plenty of  caution.  Some of the doubts result from the fact that stabilization in  Brazil is truly difficult to achieve. We have said,  simplistically, that Brazil has one currency for the rich and  another one for the poor. But it reflects what is happening. An  appreciable portion of our population has no bank accounts and,  if they do, they cannot invest. That part of the population is  the big beneficiary of a decline in the inflation rate. For  those who are indexed, a 40 percent inflation rate is not so  serious. "Serious" is what it is for the great majority of  Brazilians. But it is interesting to note that all attempts at  stabilization in Brazil have had popular support.    [O GLOBO] The popularity ratings of a finance minister  usually go up in the same proportion as inflation declines.  Imagine what would happen to a minister who is already popular  when the inflation rate is at 40 percent....    [Persio Arida] Stabilization is a difficult process. It  demands an ability to resist very strong pressures--pressure not  only from the general public, but from the lobbies. Some lobbies  are rooting for the plan, provided the adjustments are made by  others, not by them. The budget issue is an example of this.  Everyone wants to cut someone else's spending. Stabilization  demands a determined government.    [O GLOBO] Does the government have any appetite for going  against special interests?    [Persio Arida] That is one of its biggest tests: being able  to cut, and to defend the cuts in Congress.    [O GLOBO] The Congress does not want to bear the burden of  the chaos that would follow the rejection of the budget, but it  will certainly try to debate certain points. What points are  non-negotiable?    [Persio Arida] We are talking about balancing the budget.  Therefore, there is a quantitative restriction. We cannot depart  from our zero goal. We have to be careful, because it is not  only the zero goal that is important; the quality of the result  matters, too. The budget has always involved estimates. If we  overestimate the expected revenue, we will have a budget that  will look balanced, but may not be so in the long run. In other  words, depending on how it is done, one zero is not the same as  another zero. Negotiation is part of any democratic process.    [O GLOBO] In a recent interview, you said that the more time  spent in the process of adopting the new index mechanism, the  better. However, Minister Fernando Henrique has said just the  opposite.    [Persio Arida] With inflation at 40 percent, of course the  faster the process moves, the better. That is what I want to  see, too. The more rapidly the parts come together, the better.    [O GLOBO] But if it goes too quickly, might it not produce a  hyperinflation in terms of the real cruzeiro?    [Persio Arida] We would like to see this recontracting in  URV's translate into a real and permanent equilibrium. If we set  deadlines, that will lead to ill-conceived transactions.  Reducing the average period of indexation makes the index more  volatile, both upward and downward. That is why it is a step  that can only be taken when conditions are favorable. If we  start from the hypothesis that the fiscal adjustment will be  delayed and will not be approved, the tendency will be to  stretch out the indexation.    [O GLOBO] Do you believe we are vulnerable to a risk of  hyperinflation?    [Persio Arida] The classic definition of hyperinflation is  an  inflation rate above 50 percent. That definition comes from  Philip Cagan, and is based on the inflationary processes that  preceded World War II, when the financial system was not as  technologically sophisticated as it is today. Those were  processes that entered into spontaneous combustion. Once the  process got started, people took their money out of the banks  and tried to buy more things. The more they bought, the higher  prices rose and the worse things got for those who had not yet  bought. Our experience at the end of the Sarney administration  was different from classic hyperinflation. The economy was still  functioning, more or less.    [O GLOBO] Even so, isn't the approval of the fiscal  adjustment a race against time?    [Persio Arida] No question. The sooner it passes, the  better.    [O GLOBO] If it is passed, will this country get the URV the  following month?    [Persio Arida] The URV is a complex mechanism--the details  are still being discussed within the administration. The basic  concept was developed within a principle of flexibility. The  stabilization process is like a game of chess. In that sense, no  matter how well a good player can anticipate some of the moves,  there is always the imponderable. That is why it is important  that the mechanism be flexible enough to open up a range of  possibilities.    [O GLOBO] Let us anticipate just one move: will the exchange  rate between the new currency and the dollar be a fixed rate?    [Persio Arida] That question of the exchange rate has been  framed as the biggest doubt about what will happen in the third  phase.    [O GLOBO] In the Cavallo phase of the Brazilian plan?    [Persio Arida] You said that; I didn't. Any discussion of  the  third phase would be premature at present. I am not trying to  evade the question, but there is something wrong with the  Brazilian monetary system today. There needs to be an  institutional change in this area. In Argentina, they  established a fixed rule, an automatic rule. In Brazil, changes  often require changes in laws.    [O GLOBO] How will it be possible to privatize 34 companies  this year, as planned, if only one has been privatized in the  four months since you took office?    [Persio Arida] The privatization process has a long  gestation  period. We will not be starting from zero in all 34 companies;  many have already been appraised. Of course there are problems.  It is easier to sell off a steel mill than an electric power  company, which involves a public utility concession.    [O GLOBO] Even if it is technically possible, is there the  political will to privatize 34 companies in the final year of an  administration?    [Persio Arida] Privatization is an integral part of any  stabilization process. It is a contradiction in terms to pursue  a stabilization program without making progress in  privatization. The state still has a regulatory and indicative  role. The electric utility sector in the United States is  completely private, but it is also completely regulated. Having  state ownership is extremely costly. Look at the question from  the standpoint of the public debt. On the one hand, the Treasury  has properties; on the other, it has very high debt service  costs. It reminds one of a man who owns a huge tract of land and  is paying astronomical carrying charges, but will not sell a  single piece of his property.    [O GLOBO] It would be wonderful if the administration, as a  whole, believed that, wouldn't it?    [Persio Arida] That is a process of maturation. It goes  slowly. Our culture had always been a culture of the  paternalistic state.    [O GLOBO] Talking about the paternalistic state, what is the  new role of the BNDES?    [Persio Arida] I am convinced that if the state resumes its  growth at an accelerated pace, the bottlenecks in the  infrastructure will show up very dramatically. These are  projects that mature over a long time and are complicated to put  together. They are projects for which the backing of a  development bank is very important. The problem is that all  these projects are under the control of the State. Given the  State's financial crisis, guaranteeing a return on those  investments is a very different task, depending on whether they  are undertaken by the public sector or by the private sector.  The process is intimately tied to the privatization of those  same services; otherwise, the money gets lost in the web of  reciprocal debits of the public sector.    [O GLOBO] But the BNDES has lost so much by lending to the  private sector....    [Persio Arida] We are working very, very hard to recover the  sums owed us. If you look at the renegotiated credits, you will  find the bulk of them are in the public sector. The BNDES does  not make subsidized loans to anyone. Those days are over.  Subsidies and forgiveness of debts no longer exist here.    [O GLOBO] Do you think BNDES employees are too highly paid?    [Persio Arida] Concepts of equity have been distorted in  public administration. There are all kinds of inequalities:  between branches of government, within the Executive Branch, and  within the state enterprises. Salaries in the state enterprises  are not too high in comparison with those in private enterprise,  but they are ridiculously higher than those in the direct  government administration. The entire direct administration  earns very little. We need fewer civil servants, and higher  salaries. Public officials should be well paid.</p>

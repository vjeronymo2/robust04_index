			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Package outlines recovery policy THE Labour party said: 'Our proposals are in two parts. First, a package of tax and benefit changes that are self-financing. Second, a set of measures for strengthening the economy and public services. Removal of the National Insurance contribution ceiling. Employees earning less than Pounds 405 per week (Pounds 21,060 per year) pay National Insurance contributions (NICs) on all of their earnings, while above that level of earnings no NICs are paid at all. This is an unfair anomaly in our tax structure. The ceiling on contributions will be abolished. Abolishing the National Insurance entry fee. The 2 per cent contribution on earnings under Pounds 54 a week - effectively a Pounds 56 entry fee into the National Insurance system - will be abolished. We propose no changes to the National Insurance system for the self-employed. Reform of income tax personal allowances. The personal allowance will be increased by Pounds 330 per year, (10 per cent), or Pounds 180 per year above statutory indexation. As a result 740,000 taxpayers will be taken out of income tax altogether. Married couples will have the option of splitting the married couples' allowance between them as they choose. Tax rates: The basic rate of tax will remain unchanged The 40 per cent rate will remain unchanged A new top rate income tax of 50 per cent will apply to individuals with an income of at least Pounds 40,000 (taxable income of Pounds 36,375, plus the personal allowance of Pounds 3,625). Treatment of benefits in kind. Following the principle introduced by the Conservatives in last year's Budget, employers' National Insurance contributions will be extended to all taxable benefits in kind. Two per cent bribe for opting out of the state earnings-related pension scheme, Serps. The 2 per cent incentive which is currently paid to encourage people to opt out of Serps into money purchase, personal pension schemes will be withdrawn for the financial year 1992-93. Stamp duty on share transactions. The abolition of stamp duty on share transactions will be postponed for a further year. Relief for employer-provided childcare. The exemption of workplace nurseries from tax as a benefit in kind will be extended to all forms of employer assistance with childcare. This package introduces a series of valuable reforms, abolishes a tax and takes 740,000 taxpayers out of tax altogether. It also raises enough revenue to cover the following measures: Child benefit. Child benefit is currently paid at Pounds 9.65 per week for the first child and Pounds 7.80 per week for all subsequent children. This is less than its April 1987 level in real terms. Child benefit will be restored to that level - Pounds 9.95 per week  - for all children. This means higher child benefit for 12m children and is worth Pounds 127.40 per year to a family with two children. Basic state retirement pension. The basic retirement pension will be increased by Pounds 5 a week for a single person and Pounds 8 for a married couple. This will be paid on top of the annual increase for 1992, and will not lated benefits received by pensioners. People on benefits linked by statute to the level of the basic pension, such as widows and those on invalidity benefit, will also receive the increase. Overall, these changes will benefit 12m people. Investment in recovery and the future. In a full year there will be Pounds 3.5bn available for investment in health, education and the other vital public services. There will be an immediate implementation of a Pounds 1.1bn recovery programme. For the period which includes the remainder of this financial year, 1992-93, and the first full year of the Labour government, 1993-94, there will be of the order of Pounds 5.4bn additional resources available for the investment which Britain needs. The recovery programme will consist of: Manufacturing investment initiative. This consists of enhanced first-year capital allowances for additional investment in plant and machinery and in innovation and design to run for a specific period. It will encourage an investment-led recovery. Package to help business. Small firms and others have suffered severely from the Major recession. We will introduce measures to help tackle the problems of small firms and to boost investment throughout industry. A programme for skills. This consists of creating a new skills fund, Skills for the 1990s as well as restoring cuts in Employment Training and Youth Training. Work for the unemployed. We propose a radical new employment programme that for the first time shifts the focus from curing long-term unemployment to preventing it from happening at all. This job experience programme will promote work of benefit to the community as well as helping the unemployed. Training will be available to those on the programme, and people on it will be paid a 'rate for the job'. A boost for housing. Getting housebuilding going again will have a powerful employment effect in the construction industries as well as starting to meet desperate housing needs. We will begin the phased release of capital receipts held by local authorities from the sale of council houses to achieve this. Transport. We will immediately allow British Rail to proceed with a pilot leasing scheme to renovate the rol-ling stock on the North Kent line.</p>

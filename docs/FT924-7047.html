			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / International Company News: Foster's meets rights issue target FOSTER's Brewing, the Australian drinks, finance and pastoral group, yesterday said it had successfully completed a two-for-five rights issue to raise just over ADollars 1bn (USDollars 689m). Mr Ted Kunkel, chief executive, said over 97.6 per cent of the shares had been taken up, leaving a shortfall of about 21.6m in underwriters' hands. He said the issue had been 'an outstanding success' in the face of generally depressed economic conditions and a fall of 132 points in the Australian Stock Exchange All Ordinaries index between the announcement and the close of the issue. 'Foster's Brewing Group looks forward to a period of stability, and our management is firmly focused on our worldwide brewing operations. Shareholders have shown faith in the company and I believe that faith will be rewarded,' he said. The Foster's issue, which was fully underwritten, is the first big capital raising in Australia since the failure of a ADollars 1.2bn rights issue by Westpac Banking Corporation in September, which was 72 per cent undersubscribed. Foster's announced the rights issue in September, shortly after reporting a net loss of ADollars 951m for the year to the end of June, following write-downs of ADollars 1.9bn against pastoral, finance and investment operations. The group is attempting to restructure itself as a pure brewing operation, but has been unable to dispose of many non-brewing assets. The rights issue is intended to repair the group's balance sheet following a series of hefty write-downs. Broken Hill Proprietary, recently took a 32 per cent shareholding in Foster's by buying most of the stock held by the receiver to International Brewing Holdings, a private company formerly controlled by Mr John Elliott.</p>

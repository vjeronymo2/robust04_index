			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / European obstacle to coach seatbelts THE European Commission yesterday acknowledged that the UK cannot introduce tighter seatbelt laws for coaches and buses in the wake of Wednesday's coach accident in Kent in which 10 people died, David Gardner writes. Under European legislation a coach or bus can get a 'single passport' for the whole of the European Union. The UK or any other member state can introduce more stringent rules but only enforce them against operators and manufacturers which seek approval at national rather than European level. The commission has been trying to amend the legislation and has the support of the UK, Germany, Ireland and Denmark, but has so far failed to secure a qualified majority among the 12 member states.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Havana, 12 Feb (PL) -- Cuban police have  supplemented their constant operations of protecting the U.S.  Interests Section in this capital with additional measures in an  effort to keep away people who have headed to the office outside  regular business hours to demand U.S. visas.    According to local authorities, this decision was adopted  because on 10 and 11 February several groups of people -- less  than 100 in all -- approached the office with the intention of  entering the office.    These people said they heard U.S. radio stations  broadcasting  to Cuba report that U.S. visas were going to be issued to  everyone who wanted to travel to the United States and that the  protection to diplomatic installations would be lifted [que  retiraria la proteccion de las instalaciones diplomaticas].    Regarding these rumors, PRENSA LATINA has learned that an  official of the U.S. Interests Section in Havana has officially  stated to a Cuban Foreign Ministry representative that such  reports are completely false.    An official communique issued by the diplomatic office today  said the office will continue to operate normally and that only  people with previous appointments will be interviewed.    The situation around the office was quiet this afternoon.</p>

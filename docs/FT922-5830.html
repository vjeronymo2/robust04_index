			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / The Cadbury Report: Self-regulation seen as the way forward  -Industry voices support for code - Shareholders give a mixed reaction TWO assumptions underpin the recommendations of the Cadbury committee, published yesterday. One is that self-regulation, rather than statutory enforcement, is the best route to improving the way companies are run. The second is that financial markets, rather than external regulators, provide the toughest sanctions against companies that fail to reach accepted standards of corporate governance. Both rely on companies' willingness to comply - and on shareholders' readiness to shake off their traditional apathy and take a more active interest in the companies they own. Given past experience, neither can be taken for granted. The Cadbury committee was set up in response to a number of corporate scandals that cast doubt on the systems for controlling the way companies are run. The downfall of powerful figures such as Asil Nadir or the late Robert Maxwell, whose personal control over their companies was complete, raised fears about the concentration of power. The collapse of companies that only shortly before had received clean audit reports prompted renewed questioning over the part played by auditors in reporting to shareholders on their investments. It will be against those extreme cases that the success of the Cadbury recommendations will be judged. The backbone of the proposed system is an annual statement to shareholders on each company's compliance with a code of conduct, which lays down best practice for the running of companies. The code is voluntary: the report to shareholders will not be. The Stock Exchange - whose chairman, Sir Andrew Hugh Smith, sat on the committee - is expected to amend its rules for listed companies to require directors to report each year on whether they have complied with the code, and to give reasons if they have not. A company's auditors will then report on the directors' statement, to make sure shareholders are given a true picture. 'It will be quite easy to see which companies are cocking a snook,' said Mr Nigel Macdonald, a committee member and vice-chairman of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland. 'The market has already rumbled the flagrant abuses.' The Cadbury recommendations should also flush out the less obvious cases, he said. Whatever sanctions are necessary will have to come from the financial markets. 'If most companies have an audit committee and one or two barons ignore it, their cost of capital will shoot up,' said Mr Macdonald. 'It's the reverse of Gresham's Law: good practice should drive out bad.' Around that central pillar the committee proposes a patchwork of measures that together would reinforce the system for running companies. The proposals should be seen as a package, the committee says, the strength of which depends on all the proposals' being accepted. Some, however, are unlikely to see the light of day for some time. Four possible amendments to company law are proposed: to limit directors' service contracts to three years; to make it easier for auditors to report fraud; to require directors to report on their systems of internal control; and for them to state explicitly in the annual accounts that their businesses can continue as going concerns (the last two should be looked at 'in the light of experience' of other recommendations in the report). However, no new companies legislation is planned. More likely to see the light of day in the short run are proposals that do not need a change in the law: for example, that the Stock Exchange should extend the interim reporting requirements for listed companies to include balance-sheet information and an audit opinion.</p>

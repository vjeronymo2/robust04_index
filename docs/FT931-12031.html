			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Clinton pushes for early US recovery plan to boost jobs THE CLINTON administration indicated yesterday that it wanted to press ahead with an immediate recovery package because the economic turnround had failed to feed through to the jobs market. A White House spokeswoman said President Bill Clinton remained concerned that this was 'a recovery without job growth'. Fresh evidence of accelerating growth in the US emerged yesterday, with a surge in new orders for US durable goods, up 9.1 per cent between November and December, according to the Commerce Department. The administration welcomed the figures but indicated that it intended to press ahead with an early stimulus package. Mr Leon Panetta, the budget director, said he saw 'continuing weakness' in the economy that would justify a short-term stimulus to create jobs 'between now and the summer'. 'We do not want another double dip,' he said. President Clinton is at Camp David this weekend to discuss strategy with cabinet officials and senior advisers. The administration seems likely to press for quick congressional approval of a modest stimulus package based on increased public works spending and an extension of unemployment benefits. The spending might be financed with about Dollars 20bn in uncommitted funds for the current financial year. A long-term deficit-cutting package and tax incentives to spur investment may be postponed until mid-summer or later. President Clinton has never laid out a precise timetable for his economic strategy. But financial markets had expected him to enact a deficit-cutting plan at the same time as he unveiled a short-term stimulus. The surge in durable goods orders was one of the largest on record and well above Wall Street projections of a rise of about 3 per cent. Durable goods orders rose 4.1 per cent in 1992 as a whole and are now at their highest level since the end of 1988. Separate figures showed a 1 per cent increase in personal disposable incomes between November and December. However, officials pointed out that this partly reflected special factors including large bonuses in the securities industry to avoid higher taxes under the new administration. Excluding special factors, personal incomes rose about 0.3 per cent after a 0.5 per cent increase in November. The surge in orders was led by an extraordinary 21 per cent increase in orders for transport equipment and thus probably overstated the economy's underlying strength. However, economists noted that the recovery of orders was broadly-based with every industrial sector registering handsome gains. Excluding transport, orders were up 5.5 per cent last month.

			<p><P> August 11, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> CAPITAL PANDA ABORTS TINY FETUS, MAY GIVE BIRTH TO TWIN NEXT MONTH  </P> <P> Luckless giant panda Ling-Ling has aborted a fetus the size of a postage stamp,  but panda watchers at Washington's National Zoo held out hope today for a live  birth possibly within a month.  </P> <P> Zoo spokesman Bob Hoage said a fetus weighing less than a gram was found by a  keeper Thursday. A zoo pathologist said the fetus was in a very early stage of  development and was aborted spontaneously.  </P> <P> Hoage said since pandas have twins 60% of the time, it was still possible  Ling-Ling could give birth perhaps by mid-September if there is another fetus  and if the normal gestation period of roughly 97 to 168 days runs its course.  </P> <P> The 20-year-old panda, along with 19-year-old male panda Hsing-Hsing, are the  only two pandas permanently on display in the United States.  </P></p>

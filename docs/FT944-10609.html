			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Arts: Friel's 'Molly Sweeney' There are times when you have to be patient with the Irish; it can pay off in the end. The first act of Brian Friel's new play seems slow. Characters (there are only three of them) seldom move. Even the unmistakable rhythm of the Friel language begins to seem repetitive. This is deceptive. Taken all in all, Molly Sweeney is a marvellous piece of writing. To rejuvenate a cliche, there is more than meets the eye - and what does meet the eye if you have been partially blind for over 40 years, then have your sight restored? The territory is familiar Friel-land: Ballybeg, Donegal, rural Ireland and, yes, dancing is still a kind of magic formula. There is also science, culture and international communications. It is in the mixture of paganism, christianity and the modern world that Friel excels. In the old days Molly's sight might have come back by praying to the Virgin Mary or a local saint. Now it is restored by a surgeon with contacts all over the world. Never mind, the effects are much the same: it is not certain that the surgery has worked. Molly is not totally unhappy with her blindness, which came upon her at the age of 10 months. She can recognise flowers, laugh and swim; she has a job and marries. The men in the piece are Molly's husband, Frank, and the eye surgeon, Mr Rice. Frank is peculiar perhaps even by the standards of Donegal. It is not remotely clear why an unemployed Irishman should take off to lead a food convoy to Ethiopia, and stay there, while his wife is recuperating. This is a weakness in the structure of the piece. Mr Rice fits in better: the surgeon invited by Frank to perform an operation that has almost never been successful and brings international repute. He treats the operating theatre much like the stage, but admits that even when operations appear to work, it is not always clear why. There is some intellectual rambling. Diderot, John Locke and Bishop Berkeley are all thrown in. Good and bad jokes come in about equal measure. I liked the story about the imported Iranian goats who refused to adjust to Irish time. On the other hand, some of the references to the third world struck me as patronising - rather in the way the English used to talk about the Irish. The production at the Almeida comes from the Gate Theatre, Dublin where the piece had its premiere in August. Friel directs himself. The speaking of the lines by Catherine Byrne as Molly, Mark Lambert as Frank and TP McKenna as Mr Rice is immaculate. Their performances might be even better if they were allowed to act a bit more. Fine Irish writing does not automatically amount to a play.</p>

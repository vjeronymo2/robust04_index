			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Little strength behind modest rally BETTER news on UK mortgage rates and a steadier performance by sterling helped London share prices to rally yesterday from the severe shakeout of the previous session. But there was little enthusiasm behind the recovery and the FT-SE Index was never able to recapture its opening gain of nearly 23 points. The scene for a market recovery was set overnight by the UK government's move to reduce upward pressures on mortgage charges by cutting the interest rate on its latest National Savings bond, which has been draining deposits away from the building societies. A rebound in stock index futures also encouraged the UK market to join in the rally in European bourses, prompted by central bank support for the US dollar on the previous day. The early gain, however, faded as it became clear that genuine investment support was restrained by continuing uncertainty over the background both for economic progress and interest rates. In the light of the National Savings bond rate change, one of Britain's largest building societies withdrew its warning that higher mortgage rates were planned, but some City analysts said that higher home lending rates remained a danger. After returning almost to overnight levels, the market began to move forward again, but traced an erratic course, largely under the influence of the stock index futures. The final reading showed the FT-SE Index at 2,415.6 with a net gain of 11.9. At the close, London was ignoring an early gain of 16 points on the Dow Average as Wall Street responded to the address to the Senate of Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. Traders and strategists alike laid stress on the poor trading volume in the stock market. 'The market was dead,' said the leading trader at a Japanese house. Seaq volume totalled 421.2m shares, compared with 456.3m in the previous dramatic trading session. But Stock Exchange statistics disclose that on Monday, when the Footsie at one time showed its biggest fall since the Moscow coup in August 1991, retail, or customer, business was worth only Pounds 950m. For three weeks, daily retail volume has rarely moved above the Pounds 1bn mark regarded as profitable for the London securities industry. 'In spite of the sound argument that equities are outstandingly cheap, the institutions simply won't buy them at present,' said a senior dealer at a UK investment bank. 'They are buying UK government bonds.' The impending sale of 330m Wellcome shares, for which the offer closes on Friday, is also blamed for keeping the institutions out of the stock market. Traders will be glad to see this deal out of the way, but were unimpressed by reports that the Wellcome shares might be sold at a 5 per cent discount to the current market price. The best news of the day, according to the market, came when British Airways confirmed that it is gaining valuable access to the US airline business by taking an equity stake in USAir Group.</p>

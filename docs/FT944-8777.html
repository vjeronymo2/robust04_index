			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Thatcher takes up arms of war Baroness Thatcher's coat of arms, with the Falklands war a central theme, was unveiled yesterday. The former prime minister is said to be delighted with the creation by Sir Colin Cole, the retired Garter King of Arms. Sir Colin said it symbolised Lady Thatcher's 'sentiments, career and achievements'. The Falklands victory is depicted by the figure of an admiral on active service. A representation of Sir Isaac Newton, who came from the the same area as Lady Thatcher - Grantham, Lincolnshire - symbolises her abiding interest in science. The motto 'Cherish Freedom' was chosen by Lady Thatcher as being 'short and appropriate'. The coronet with four pearls is the traditional heraldic symbol for a baron or baroness. The lions, representing patriotism, are supporting a double key, which alludes to the double office of prime minister and First Lord of the Treasury. The tower and portcullis represent the Palace of Westminster and the cross beneath, the Order of Merit.</p>

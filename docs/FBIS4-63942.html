			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis over the </F> phone from the United States on 25 May; from the "Labrit"  program -- recorded]    [Text] There were three serious meetings with UN  Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali and members of the  Security Council, and in the afternoon with U.S. President  Clinton.    During all three meetings, the main issue was and remains  the  withdrawal of the Russian Army, its timetable, guarantees, and  how not to allow, under any circumstances, this timetahle and  these guarantees to be shaken in some way. I think that I  received such guarantees in full from all three talks, and I  would like to say today that there is no doubt that the troops  will be withdrawn from Latvia in several months.    The second most important issue we discussed was the Skrunda  radar station, what status it should have, how we will control  the it, why there have to be guarantees so that after four  years, the Skrunda will no longer be in Latvia, and so on and so  on. All these issues caused rather lively discussions. So, for  example, the United Nations Organization has not yet considered  this issue seriously from the angle of guaranteeing the status  of the Skrunda radar station. And during the talks with the  Russian ambassador, we ascertained that after our talks in  Russia, these instructions have, nevertheless, been (?brought)  here and I think that within a few days, such guarantees will  also be officially drawn up at the United Nations Organization.    The next issue was human rights, though this time it was no  longer so acute and during the talks we were nowhere near to  being reproached. I think that it is to a certain extent the  success of both the Latvian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and  Latvian diplomats that, with our stance on concluding the  agreement with Russia, we showed both Latvian political maturity  and Latvia's wish to listen to foreign states and to enter the  world as a serious state with serious intentions, so that we  never return to the system of CIS countries, which is being  formed at the moment. But when we were speaking about human  rights issues, we agreed then that this autumn, Hoze Lasso, high  commissioner of the United Nations Organization, would visit the  Nordic countries, Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia, to find out  that human rights are no longer violated, nor have they ever  been violated in the past.    We were talked a lot with UN leaders and with U.S. leaders  about the necessity for both U.S. leaders and UN leaders to  visit Latvia and find out how Latvia is developing and evolving.  And I think that we have reached a certain agreement on these  issues. Time will show which people will arrive and what they  will give to Latvia.    With the U.S. President we not only talked about the  agreement, but we also talked about future Latvian economic  development. We said that to a certain extent American capital  would have to come to Latvia, where the government would  guarantee the use of the capital or would guarantee the  inviolability of this capital, or something of the kind, so that  the capital would be able to come more safely to the Baltic  states.    And finishing this subject, I raised the issue of Estonia,  because Baltic unity is of primary importance in all these  issues. And I once again underlined that Latvia supports Estonia  in all its requests. One of the issues I raised was the issue  of the Paldiski base in Estonia, whose nuclear waste or nuclear  energy may to a certain extent influence the future ecological  and environmental protection situation in the Baltics.    While discussing Baltic security, we touched on three  issues:  the Skrunda radar station, the Paldiski base, and Kaliningrad --  because there is nowhere else in the world where there is such a  level of concentration of armed forces, as in Kaliningrad. I  think that we received some support from both the United Nations  and the United States, and also from the Security Council.    And as a proposal for our future Latvian strategy, we  brought  up the issue that perhaps in two or three years, it would be  necessary to hold in Latvia a summit meeting of all heads of  government, at which issues of how to use all the funds left  over from the reduction of militarism, from arms reduction, from  the withdrawal of troops, and so on would be discussed; so that  it will be possible to direct all these funds toward the  protection of the environment. And, as we laughed with President  Clinton, we would be able to set up a green program on a world  scale, which would take the place of militarism,  totalitarianism, and armament.</p>

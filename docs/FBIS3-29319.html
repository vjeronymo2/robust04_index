The turmoil,  however, has left an indelible mutual distrust between Prime  Minister Hosokawa and Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura who are  playing a pivotal role in the coalition government. Their  discord still remains deep in the prime minister's official  residence, and there is a possibility that discord could erupt  some day in the future.    At a news conference on the afternoon of 8 February, Prime  Minister Hosokawa apologized to the people for his failure to  undertake the proper procedure prior to the announcement of the  "national welfare tax." Shortly after the news conference,  Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura murmured, "Although I did not  see well, I wonder if Mr. Hosokawa bowed his head to the people."    Mr. Takemura's expression revealed his discontent with the  prime minister, who devoted much of his time in the news  conference to the clarification of his position while  apologizing to the people.    Mr. Takemura was notified of the plan for the "national  welfare tax" that the prime minister had drawn up behind the  scenes on the advice of Ichiro Ozawa, representative secretary  of Shinseito [the Japan Renewal Party], and Yuichi Ichikawa,  secretary general of the Komeito, shortly before dawn 3  February, when the prime minister announced the new tax system  at a news conference. The Social Democratic Party of Japan  [SDPJ] resisted the new tax system with the posture of not  hesitating to back out of the coalition government. Speaking at  a news conference on the morning of 3 February, Mr. Takemura  said: "It cannot be said that all things are right. There is a  saying that it is best to correct mistakes." In this way, from  the outset, Mr. Takemura urged the prime minister to think of  shelving his plan for a national welfare tax.    The chief cabinet secretary, who is in a position to assist  the prime minister, admonished the prime minister. In reaction,  people in the ruling coalition parties criticized Mr. Takemura,  saying, "He is like a wife who calls her husband a `bad guy at  home' when her husband is criticized by people," (according to a  senior official of a ruling party).    At the time of inaugurating the coalition government, they  were widely known "allies." They have promised a "marriage" of  merging the Japan New Party and Sakigake [the Harbinger Party].  The story of the marriage, however, still floats in the air as  the prime minister increasingly attaches importance to his ties  with Messrs. Ozawa and Ichikawa, and the feud is intensifying  between Mr. Takemura and Messers. Ozawa and Ichikawa.    The differences between the prime minister and Mr. Takemura  on the strategy and prospects for a realignment of political  parties are becoming apparent. In the midst of the uproar over  the tax issue, Mr. Takemura met with Keigo Ouchi, health and  welfare minister and chairman of the Democratic Socialist Party,  and Satsuki Eda, director general of the Science and Technology  Agency, and representative of the the United Social Democratic  Party. Mr. Takemura is solidifying his ties with social  democratic forces while arranging a meeting between Tomiichi  Murayama, chairman of the SDPJ, and Chairman Ouchi. There is no  doubt that he is making those moves with the second realignment  of political parties taken into account. His moves also aim at  keeping the prime minister from tilting toward the Shinseito  [the Japan Renewal Party] and the Komeito.    Mr. Takemura once spoke highly of the prime minister,  saying,  "Mr. Hosokawa is a person who can make manly decisions." Of  late, however, Mr. Takemura has not praised the prime minister's  ability to make decisions. Now they are unable to read each  others' real intentions, and Mr. Takemura appears to have sensed  that the prime minister is making decisions on the advice of  Messers. Ozawa and Ichikawa while "leaving him out in the cold."    During the government of the Liberal Democratic Party, the  practice was that the post of chief cabinet secretary went to a  politician who had served the prime minister as his confidant  for a long time. The relationship between the prime minister and  the chief cabinet secretary has changed under the coalition  government. Less than two years have passed since the prime  minister and Mr. Takemura began to work together as political  allies. It seems that Mr. Takemura thinks of himself as a key  player on an equal footing with the prime minister. At the prime  minister's official residence, their uneasy relationship has  become the daily target of attention.</p>

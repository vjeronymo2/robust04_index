			<p>921231 FT  31 DEC 92 / Winterthur to put further Pounds 11m into motor insurer WINTERTHUR, one of Switzerland's biggest insurers, is to pump a further Pounds 11m of capital into its Churchill Insurance subsidiary, paving the way for further expansion by the rapidly growing motor insurance company. Churchill is the second biggest 'direct writer' in the UK, behind Direct Line, the highly success-ful Royal Bank of Scotland subsidiary, which earlier this year reported annual profits of Pounds 15.1m in the 12 months to September 30. 'Direct writers' which sell motor insurance through a combination of mass media marketing and telephone sales are poised to win a growing share of the Pounds 4bn-a-year motor insurance market. Churchill has grown rapidly since its launch in 1989. Premium income increased by more than 100 per cent during 1992 to Pounds 79.7m. Mr Martin Long, chief executive, is planning further expansion in 1993, when he aims to boost premium income to Pounds 135m. 'The more premium you get in the more capital you need to fund it,' said Mr Long, who says Winterthur is keen to take advantage of rising premium rates in motor business. Mr Long said that while the frequency of claims was falling, premiums were rising and the increases were sticking. Although Churchill expects to incur pre-tax losses of Pounds 2m (before tax recoveries) in 1992, Mr Long says it has been trading profitably since April. Of the Pounds 11m of new capital approved by Winterthur, some Pounds 5m will be in the form of new paid-up capital, boosting paid-up capital to Pounds 49m - compared with the Pounds 30m originally invested by Winterthur. The remaining Pounds 6m has been earmarked to take advantage of further opportunities next year. Churchill wrote 230,000 new policies in 1992 and is aiming to win 320,000 new customers in 1993, a market share of between 3 and 4 per cent, according to Mr Long. To date it has sold more than 480,000 policies. So far Churchill has focused on motor insurance but next year could move into the household insurance market. Two of Churchill's direct writing competitors - Direct Line and GA 121, a subsidiary of Perth-based General Accident - already underwrite household insurance. Another continental European company, France's Groupe des Assurances Nationales, is also poised to launch a new direct writing operation next year.</p>

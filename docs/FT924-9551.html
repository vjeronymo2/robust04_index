			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Scottish National to reduce pay-out The Scottish National Trust, a split capital trust managed by Gartmore Scotland, had a net asset value of 2.8p per capital share, down from 92.8p over the 12 months to September 30. The value per income share was 73.1p (68.7p); per zero dividend preference share 170.8p (153.5p) and per stepped preference share 127.6p (121.6p). Net revenue was little changed at Pounds 16m, for earnings of 8.74p (8.85p) per income share. A proposed final dividend of 3.05p maintains the total at an uncovered 8.85p with utilisation of part of the revenue reserve. Mr Sandy Struthers, chairman, said the total for the current year was likely to be reduced to about 7.5p.</p>

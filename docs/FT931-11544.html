			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Gooda Walker loss put at Pounds 924m: Four-year results of Lloyd's syndicates could be worst in market history GOODA WALKER syndicates at Lloyd's of London suffered losses of nearly Pounds 924m in the four years to 1990 - possibly the largest experienced on the insurance market - according to estimates released yesterday. An interim report from GW Run-Off, the agency managing the defunct syndicates, showed substantially increased losses for 1989 of Pounds 621m - or nearly 30 per cent of losses across the entire Lloyd's insurance market for the year. Some 4,000 Names - the individuals whose assets underwrite the market - on the seven Gooda syndicates also received initial estimated losses for the 1990 underwriting year of Pounds 188m. Mr Michael Deeny, chairman-elect of the Gooda Walker Action Group, said last night: 'This is absolutely horrific. It's larger than we expected and very depressing for Lloyd's Names.' But Mr Ralph Sharp, chairman of GW Run-Off, warned that the estimates could still increase substantially because they took no account of losses from asbestosis and pollution or allowances for the collapse of reinsurance companies. In a measure of the difficulty facing Names trying to meet their commitments to the syndicates, the report showed that only two thirds of the Pounds 598m in calls made from syndicates during 1991 and 1992 had been received by the end of last year. Syndicate 387 alone posted losses of 750 per cent of its underwriting capacity for 1989, the last year in which it wrote insurance business and the highest proportion on a Lloyd's syndicate. The other syndicates - 164, 290, 295, 296, 298 and 299 - showed losses of between 5 per cent and 150 per cent in the years 1986-90. Additional costs for 1986-89 rose by Pounds 142m, of which Pounds 46m was attributed to exchange rate losses and Pounds 24m was in further reserves against claims connected with Hurricane Hugo. GW Run-Off said that it was investigating several aspects of the management of the Gooda syndicates, including 'under-reserving' - making insufficient provision against possible losses - on syndicates 164 and 290, and bonuses and salaries paid to former staff and a fleet of cars charged to syndicate funds. The report criticised Lloyd's for charging Pounds 12m in interest payments at 5 per cent over UK base rates on overdrawn money held with the market. Mr Sharp called the charges 'excessive'. But Lloyd's defended its decision, which it said had been reviewed as recently as December. It also said that the losses were in line with the estimates it had calculated late last year, and it was confident that these could be supported within the Central Fund, which meets claims that Lloyd's Names are unable to meet. Mr Deeny said that Names were to issue writs alleging negligence against Gooda Walker and other agencies within the next month and were confident that they had a strong case.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Brasilia -- In a plenary session held on 12 April,  the Superior Electoral Court [TSE] confirmed that the number of  federal deputies to be elected for Sao Paulo State will increase  from 60 to 70. The TSE did not change, however, the number of  federal deputies to be elected for other states. Thus, Sao  Paulo State voters will elect 10 more federal deputies in  October.    If the proportional system established in Supplementary Law  No. 78 of 30 December 1993 was to be fully applied, states like  Rio de Janeiro, Parana, and Espirito Santo should lose a deputy  each, while Bahia State should win three deputies and Minas  Gerais two deputies. But the TSE decided to change only the  number of deputies for Sao Paulo State, based on that law, which  provides that "the largest state will be represented by 70  federal deputies."    The TSE made this decision unanimously after ruling that  Article 4 of the temporary provisions (which referred to the  1990 elections) is valid and thus endorsed the position that the  blocs of federal deputies will not be changed during the first  legislature following the issuance of the supplementary law.    The aforementioned law, which implements the constitutional  rule that the number of federal deputies will be proportional to  the population of each state, was not approved until late last  year and was not published until 5 January. The law thus will  be applicable only to the 1998 elections.    In addition to increasing the number of federal deputies in  the state, Sao Paulo voters also will be able to elect more  state deputies in October, that is, 90 deputies.</p>

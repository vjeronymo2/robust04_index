			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Lloyds likely to win round in battle over Midland Bank MIDLAND BANK is expected to lose the first round of its fight to prevent its rival, Lloyds, from obtaining access to detailed information on its finances. The executive of the Takeover Panel, the City's arbiter of bid tactics, is likely to rule that Midland should provide Lloyds with financial information which Midland has already given to Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. A decision could be made today. However, Midland is likely to appeal to the panel's full council, if the decision goes against it. The panel's executive is understood to have accepted Lloyds' argument that it is a 'bona fide potential offeror' under the terms of the takeover code. If that is the case, then Lloyds has the right to receive information on Midland which any other bidder for Midland has received. Hongkong Bank, which has made a formal takeover offer for Midland, has access to Midland's accounts. It has been a 15 per cent shareholder in Midland since 1987. It carried out a financial investigation of Midland, a process known as 'due diligence', before making its bid. Midland has declined to give the same information to Lloyds. Lloyds has said it will bid for Midland, subject to two preconditions, but it has not made a formal offer. Midland is concerned Lloyds will never make a formal offer. Midland views Lloyds as an arch-rival and fears its business could be damaged if it gives Lloyds commercially valuable information. One of the two preconditions to a Lloyds bid is that it should receive all information on Midland which Hongkong Bank has received since January 1 1992. The other precondition is that either Lloyds must be satisfied that its proposed offer will not be referred for scrutiny by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, the UK competition authority, or that Hongkong Bank's bid will be referred if Lloyds' bid is. The Office of Fair Trading is expected to recommend early next week that Lloyds' bid should be referred. However, Hongkong Bank's bid is unlikely to be referred to the MMC. Mr Michael Heseltine, president of the Board of Trade, has to decide whether to follow the OFT's advice. If he does, Lloyds may drop the MMC precondition. Lloyds is convinced that its proposed offer has won considerable support from Midland's shareholders. It believes these shareholders may be prepared to wait during the three months of an MMC inquiry before deciding whether to back a Lloyds bid or Hongkong Bank's offer. MPs could hold the whip hand, Page 22</p>

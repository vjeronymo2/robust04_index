			<p><P> May 20, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DANCE REVIEW;  </P> <P> ANIMALS ABOUND, BUT ENSEMBLE'S INCREASING PROWESS IS EVIDENT  </P> <P> Although San Diego is a border town, cross-cultural exchanges between local  arts organizations and their Mexican neighbors are few and far between.  </P> <P> A welcome exception is San Diego-based American Ballet Ensemble's ongoing  relationship with Tijuana and other cities south of the border.  </P> <P> The school-based company, directed by former Balanchine ballerina Lynda Yourth,  performs regularly for Mexican audiences and always features Mexican dancers.  </P> <P> When the ABE returned to Tijuana last Saturday for two concerts of "Light  Classics," the program included the world premiere of Yourth's "Peter and the  Wolf," a dance drama driven as much by the narration as by its famous Prokofiev  score.  </P> <P> American Ballet Ensemble will make its debut at the Lyceum Theatre this weekend  with the same program. Performances will take place at 2 and 8 p.m. today and 2  p.m. Sunday.  </P> <P> Although the one-act ballet was conceived for use in outreach programs around  San Diego, Yourth designed an adaptation for Tijuana audiences that included a  Spanish-language narrative of the fable.  </P> <P> The choreography was about what you might expect from a ballet "peopled" with  birds, ducks, wolves and other woodland creatures. Paying short shrift to the  canons of classical ballet, Yourth stressed the libretto's storybook elements  in her movement motifs.  </P> <P> The duck (Jana Emery) waddled, the fragile-looking bird (Aura Dixon) fluttered  and flew -- at least fleetingly -- the cat (Claire Taber) slinked through her  feline motional patterns, and frogs (there were three of them) crouched and  jumped on cue.  </P> <P> Only Peter, danced with athletic vigor by Christopher Mac Dougall, had a chance  to shine in dance terms during this little diversion.  </P> <P> Judging from the program notes (which credits the dancers for contributing to  the choreography), and the predictable nature of the moves, the animal images  must have been hatched in improvisation sessions.  </P> <P> Visually, the ballet was a lot more interesting. Clark Mires' costumes,  particularly the masks, were delightful. Biff Baker's forest backdrop was  effective in evoking the sylvan setting, although it seemed all too realistic  to complement the stylized tree that served as the anchor for the action.  </P> <P> Yourth added a more upbeat ending to the old tale by shipping the trussed-up  wolf off to the zoo for the denouement -- an appropriate bit of poetic license  by the storyteller, considering San Diego is home to one of the world's most  famous zoos.  </P> <P> John Williams' theme from the movie "Jaws" provided the eerie accompaniment to  another storybook ballet on the program, Clarissa Boeriu's "The Fisherman and  the Crab." This very contemporary ballet may have taken its thematic content  from the fairy-tales, but that was all.  </P> <P> A willowy-slim Aura Dixon and her bare-chested partner, Peter Schetters, paired  off in a series of complex couplings that vaguely suggested the conflict  between the characters. Although Dixon is only 15 years old, she held her own  very nicely with the veteran danseur. Schetters is a former member of the Dutch  National Ballet.  </P> <P> The last two pieces on the program gave the dancers (there are 30 in the  ensemble now) better opportunities to show off their ever-increasing technical  prowess.  </P> <P> "The Blue Danube Waltz," an excerpt from a full suite of Strauss waltzes  choreographed by Mieczyslaw Morawski, was well-rehearsed and impressively  danced -- considering the student status of the dancers.  </P> <P> A 20-member cast crowded the stage with an amplitude of movement that almost  matched the breathless surge of the music. It was a return to genteel elegance  as the girls made sweeping circles with their frothy chiffon skirts, while  their partners held them gallantly, if not always securely, aloft.  </P> <P> With pianist Douglas C. Buurma on stage to accompany the dancers, Yourth's  revival of "Rag Suite" was more than just a string of spirited dances. It was a  playful period piece -- set in an old-time ice cream parlor -- that kept the  dancers on their toes from start to finish.  </P> <P> This fast-paced, witty and totally unself-conscious ballet spoofed the symbols  of the period and some of ballet's sacred cows as well. It also proved to be a  fine showcase for the energetic ensemble.  </P></p>

			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Washington on defensive over loans for Vietnam: Hanoi is looking for money, while the US is looking for policies reports Victor Mallet from the ADB meeting NOT FOR the first time at an international forum, the US was on the defensive at this week's annual meeting of the Asian Development Bank in Manila. Its isolation was particularly marked over its continuing refusal to countenance ADB loans for Vietnam because of a US economic embargo dating back to Hanoi's Vietnam war victory in 1975. Japan, Germany, France and Asian countries all pressed Vietnam's case at the ADB, as they have at the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. But the Clinton administration, fearful of lobbyists at home who claim Vietnam has hidden or killed US prisoners of war, has deferred a decision on renewing multilateral aid until the next IMF board meeting in June. The US has only 13 per cent of the voting power in the ADB, but the bank likes to ensure consensus before taking any decisions. Iran's application for membership is being blocked by the US and some of its allies, but Vietnam is already a member and is just unable to borrow. 'We think that we should be treated equally with other member countries,' Mr Cao Sy Kiem, the head of the Vietnamese delegation, told the meeting. ADB staff are itching to start lending to Vietnam and have already visited the country numerous times to prepare 10 projects which will focus on much-needed improvements to Vietnam's infrastructure, including electricity transmission, water supplies and Saigon port. The ADB expects to extend more than Dollars 200m (Pounds 130m) a year in soft loans to Vietnam as soon as Washington gives the green light. 'We have prepared everything for Vietnam for the last two or three years,' said one ADB official. 'We have been waiting at the starting line, but no gun is fired.' The US was given only a marginally more sympathetic hearing at the ADB this week when it called for the bank to restrain its urge to lend more and more each year and reaffirmed its reluctance to accept a proposed doubling of the bank's Dollars 23bn capital. Developing Asian countries and Japan, the other main shareholder along with the US, boasted that in 1992 the ADB had lent a record Dollars 5bn in ordinary and soft credits. Several western nations, however, echoed the US calls for thrift and a greater emphasis on the quality rather than the quantity of projects. The planned capital increase and the 'sustainable level of lending' (SLL) concept - a pet phrase of US representatives to multilateral institutions these days - proved to be controversial even among the US and its allies. The basic idea of SLL is simple enough: development banks should reach a point where they can fund new lending from their own profits and from the incoming repayment of previous loans instead of expanding for ever with repeated injections of cash from the US and other donors. The arguments arise when it comes to deciding what annual level of loans is desirable in the long term. If SLL was applied now, ADB officials say, the bank would have to restrict its annual lending from ordinary resources to about Dollars 3.4bn, or below the present level of around Dollars 4bn, whereas the bank's managers intend to increase lending by more than 10 per cent a year to Dollars 7bn or Dollars 8bn by 1998 to meet growing demand for finance from China, India and others. 'We could be bonsai-ed, like a plant in a pot that never gets bigger,' says one senior ADB official. Many bank officials believe the US proposal of SLL is linked to its reluctance to subscribe to the capital increase. One way to avoid a capital increase, the US says, is to reinterpret the ADB charter so that it is the total loan disbursements - rather than loan commitments - which must not exceed capital and reserves of about Dollars 27bn. Loan commitments are close to the limit but disbursements lag behind and there is more than Dollars 11bn of undisbursed ADB loans. ADB officials say that if the charter is reinterpreted, as Washington wishes, to remove the limit on commitments, then SLL or some other safeguard is obviously needed to prevent the bank from making loan promises it cannot keep. 'SLL is only relevant if you have a new charter interpretation - to stop you making more commitments than you can find when you disburse,' says Mr Gunther Schulz, ADB vice-president for finance and administration. Several countries, including France, expressed reservations about SLL and said regular replenishments of the bank's resources were important because they allowed shareholding nations to review and discuss the ADB's objectives. The US was further weakened in its isolated stand at the ADB by the sense of uncertainty among US representatives about the Clinton administration's as yet unformed policy towards multilateral institutions, by the relatively junior level of its delegation, and by the fact that the US is in arrears on its existing commitments to the ADB and its soft loan arm, the Asian Development Fund. Most Asian delegates left Manila with the impression that the Americans, whether discussing Vietnam or the proposed capital increase, were playing for time until they can decide what policies to adopt.</p>

			<p><P> July 30, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Former Olympic diver Bruce Kimball, convicted of manslaughter two years ago  when he drove his car into a crowd and killed two teen-agers, says he feels  constant remorse about the accident.  </P> <P> "For a while, I've been wanting to come forward, but it's very difficult to  talk about these things.  </P> <P> I didn't take it in stride," Kimball told The Tampa Tribune in his first  interview since being sentenced to 17 years in prison in January of 1989.  </P> <P> "I want people to know that I am sorry for what I've done and I'm trying to  change my life.  </P> <P> Kimball has served 19 months of his sentence for the Aug. 1, 1988 incident in  Brandon, Fla., that killed two and injured six. He was legally drunk at the  time his sports car rammed into the group. Kimball pleaded guilty and never  spoke publicly about his feelings -- leading families of the teen-agers to  believe he didn't care.  </P> <P> In an interview at Marion Correctional Institution in Ocala, Fla., Kimball, 27,  also said he was a drug abuser at the time.  </P> <P> "Primarily cocaine, marijuana and alcohol is what I used. I was cross-addicted  to all those," Kimball said.  </P></p>

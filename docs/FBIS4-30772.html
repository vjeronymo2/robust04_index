			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by President Franjo Tudjman at a ceremony marking </F> the launch of the kuna, the new Croatian currency, at the  National Bank of Croatia in Zagreb on 30 May -- recorded]    [Text] There can be no doubt that the introduction of the  national currency is the final act on the thorny path to  establishing the independent and sovereign Croatian state. As  the governor said, in order to be able to pass such a decision,  we had to create certain conditions -- political, economic, and  international.    In the political sphere, we had to strengthen the democratic  system in the Republic of Croatia. In the economy, we had to  complete the reconstruction, the transformation of ownership,  the restructuring of the socialist economy, of the socialist  system into the free market. Of course, that task has not yet  been completed but we have laid the foundations for it. We have  made achievements in the stabilization program and in curbing  inflation, despite unfavorable circumstances and despite the  consequences of the war. The former governments -- of Greguric  and Sarinic -- have contributed to it, and the government of  Nikica Valentic added the final stroke, prompting the  astonishment and admiration of the world and of economic  experts.    In the international sphere we had to create conditions for  Croatia to consolidate its position, for it to become not only  internationally recognized, but also to win allies in the world  both politically and economically. Today Croatia has such  allies in the modern world.    These were the preconditions necessary for us to launch this  final act of marking the national sovereignty of the Croatian  people and of the Croatian state.    And as for the name: The Croatian nation is one of the  oldest  in Europe and it has the right to give its currency an original  name. As academician Brozovic proved in his thesis, a long time  ago, the mink [kuna] was a means of payment in the Croatian  lands from Slavonia to Istria. The fur of the marten was a  means of payment in other countries as well, but I do not know  of any other country that attached the same significance to the  mink as it had in Croatian history and [words indistinct].  Thus, the marten is on the historic coat-of-arms of the  historic Croatian Kingdom of Slavonia. Therefore, we have the  right to give our currency a different name, the one we have  preserved in financial transactions since time immemorial. This  is why we decided, in that respect as well -- we have survived  as a peculiar, different national entity in Europe and in the  world -- to appear in the world with a different name for our  currency.    At all times and in all countries, the introduction of a  national currency is of major significance in the moral,  political, psychological, and economic sense. I am convinced  that the introduction of our currency -- the kuna and lipa --  will have the same significance, that it will encourage our  people -- from schoolchildren to the elderly -- to treat our  currency in a more serious and economical way in business and in  the state administration, so that it becomes the basis for  faster economic and cultural development, the basis for our  successful cooperation with the modern world because, I believe,  it will retain convertibility owing to the results achieved.    The Croatian people deserve that. They have contributed,  they have in fact achieved this in a political, economic and,  unfortunately, military sense by defending their homeland from  aggression. The Croatian people today have their own currency  as a means for their future development.    As head of state, I would like to express the homeland's  gratitude to all the people who have created the preconditions  for the introduction of our currency and to all the people,  technicians and artists, who were directly involved in creating  the beautiful design of our currency.    Thank you, and let the historic path of our new Croatian  currency be happy. [applause]</p>

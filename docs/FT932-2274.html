			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Letter: Hardship committee is not the real answer Sir, Mr Hamilton Stutt's letter (June 1) summed up the inequity of what Lloyd's is attempting to put over on the ruined Names. Mr Michael Wade, a working Name and market practitioner, on the other hand does not seem to appreciate the real size of the problem (Letters, June 2). It is possible, though unlikely, that he has suffered the level of loss that I and probably Mr Stutt have had to endure. My Lloyd's accounts and estimates show I have lost at least Pounds 1.1m in the four years of account to December 1990, and when final results are out undoubtedly still more. This, on a premium limit averaging Pounds 293,000, is a bit rich. It could take all my assets and more. Multiple exposure to Gooda Walker and Feltrim has done it, as for many others. It looked like diversification but was not. The Lime St members agency (involuntary liquidation) chose my syndicates with Lloyd's full knowledge. The business plan following the task force report seeks to show how this kind of personal catastrophe should be impossible under the regime of the future. It seems significant that in arguing for the changes very damaging admissions are made, explicitly and implicitly, about failure to regulate the market in the past. So some of us are amazed that it is taking so long to produce a better answer than the hardship committee (really a debt collector). If nothing else is done, like Samson blinded, we are quite prepared to pull down the pillars of the Philistines' temple. But if sensible arrangements are made to take care of the negligent or perhaps illegal parts of our losses, then we will gladly co-operate and so help Lloyd's to continue and trade profitably. Interestingly, the proposed 80 per cent high level stop loss scheme would have paid Pounds 733,000 of my losses had it been in place. Perhaps that suggests a solution?

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Miriam Mercado] </F>   [Text] Tegucigalpa, 24 May (NOTIMEX) -- The foreign  ministers of Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, and Panama  consider it urgent for the OAS to debate Cuba's return to the  hemispheric organization.    Costa Rican Foreign Minister Fernando Naranjo told NOTIMEX  the government of Jose Maria Figueres, who was sworn in on 8  May, will review its relations with Cuba. "The Cuban people  have been greatly harmed by a blockade that has lasted many  decades, and we believe the Cuban problem should be discussed  within the OAS," Naranjo said. He stated: "In a matter of  months, Costa Rica will approach the OAS concerning what we  believe should be a revision of the Cuban situation," the Costa  Rican minister added.    We do not rule out the possibility of analyzing Cuba's  situation at the next OAS general assembly, which is scheduled  to be held in Belen do Para, Brazil, from 6 to 10 June, the  Honduran Foreign Ministry reported.    Haiti's problem is another case that must be analyzed within  the OAS, Naranjo said. The strengthening of the democratic  system, the human rights issue, and the integration process are  part of the topics in the agenda for the next OAS general  assembly in Brazil.    Moreover, Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Ernesto Leal told  NOTIMEX that, "in Cuba's specific case, the world has changed,  and we believe Cuba must return to the OAS."    Honduran Foreign Minister Ernesto Paz Aguilar said "Cuba is  a  brother country that belongs to the American hemisphere and it  must be reinstated in the OAS."    Panamanian Deputy Foreign Minister Carlos Cordero Gonzalez  said he "disagrees" with the blockade enforced by the United  States against Cuba for more than 30 years. "The case of the  Cuban embargo must be discussed at the OAS because this is  apparently the last remnant of the Cold War redoubt," Cordero  said.    Guatemalan Foreign Minister Marithza Ruiz de Vielman  emphasized that the president of her country, Ramiro de Leon  Carpio, has yet to define what position he will adopt concerning  the Cuban case.    Salvadoran Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Salaverria revealed  a position similar to the one adopted by Guatemala when he said  President Alfredo Cristiani's administration has yet to discuss  the Cuban issue.</p>

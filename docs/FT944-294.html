			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / Economy hostage to war, oil and Yeltsin: The desperate struggle waged by reformists over three crucial issues The Russian government's proclaimed aim of stabilising the economy next year  -a move seen as indispensable to bringing stability not just to the economy but to politics - now rests on the outcome of a desperate behind-the scenes struggle by reformists over three critical issues: the war in Chechnya; a system of domestic oil quotas; and the support of President Boris Yeltsin. The 1995 budget assumes loans from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank totalling nearly Dollars 13bn, which will account for a third of budget income. But this lending is now in the balance because of a series of massive problems, any one of which might throw such a programme off track. The cost of the Chechen war is estimated to be running at some Rbs3,000bn a week, and mounting. The final bill, including rebuilding the severely damaged capital, Grozny, and other towns, had been put initially at Rbs1,000bn but all estimates are now much higher. In addition, the military will demand greatly increased expenditure as the price for their engagement in the war. A system of domestic oil quotas is now in draft form, and would replace the quotas on oil exports which remain in force until January 1. Mr Yevgenny Yasin, the pro-reformist economics minister, said yesterday that the draft had not yet been signed, but he expected a decision from Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister in the next couple of days. 'Our view in the economics ministry is that fears that ending quotas will lead to a shortage of oil in the domestic market are insufficiently grounded, and that a decision to liberalise is absolutely essential.' Abolition of the quotas is seen by the IMF and the World Bank as vital to the liberalisation of oil prices, which in turn is seen as a necessary condition for economic stabilisation. IMF sources said yesterday that the decision was a crucial test of the government's good intentions. The position of the president on these issues is presently unknown. Mr Yeltsin has formally backed the budget strategy, but has in the past insisted on his own freedom of action to issue decrees and approve laws which contradict budget strategy. The reformists now fear that unless he explicitly endorses the 1995 budget itself, it will fail to command domestic and international support. Mr Yeltsin has recently approved a law abolishing a profit tax paid by banks, and is said to be in favour of signing legislation raising minimum wages. Government officials admit that the first quarter of the new year will be exceptionally difficult as revenues are traditionally low at that period and the costs of the Chechen war are mounting. However, they also believe that the budget deficit of 8.2 per cent of official gross domestic product (estimated at Rbs925,000bn) can be brought down, in part because the GDP forecast is too low. They also believe that if the IMF can agree on a standby loan in the middle of January, inflation now running at around 15 per cent a month can be swiftly lowered as expectations are reduced. Mr Jochen Wermuth, head of the group of experts working with the finance ministry, said last night that 'given recent positive developments in revenue collection and additional revenue measures which the government can implement without the agreement of the Duma (lower house of parliament), it is likely that the government deficit could be as low as 5 per cent, sufficiently low to allow for a credible policy of stabilisation - if supported by a stabilisation fund'. He added, however: 'Given the constraints on the budget in the first quarter, quick IMF support for the programme is central.'</p>

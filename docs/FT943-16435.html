			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Open services, developing countries told Developing countries should not be afraid of liberalising their service sectors, according to a report published today by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development in conjunction with the World Bank. However, countries need to pay close attention to the manner and timing of reform, and to their regulatory frameworks, before embarking on liberalisation, it says. The report is intended as a practical guide to developing countries in creating policies to improve the efficiency of their service industries through the easing of curbs on international transactions. Service industries are making a growing contribution to employment and output generation in both developed and undeveloped countries, the report notes, and many of the latter have become keenly aware of the role of services in the development process. Indeed, the report says, there is growing evidence suggesting that the development of some service sector activities may not be the result of growth elsewhere in an economy, but one of its preconditions. Opening of domestic markets to foreign service providers is a major way to ensure increased efficiency in the provision of services and, by fostering competition, tends to enhance the efficiency of domestic producers, the report says. Liberalisation is often attacked as opening the door to foreign domination and putting local jobs at risk. The report cites beneficial results from opening up the financial sector in both developed and undeveloped countries. 'Concerns that foreign banks might dominate the domestic market typically have proved unwarranted. Instead a complementary role has developed between foreign and domestic banks . . .' the authors say. Developing countries should also look at the arguments for and against liberalisation in an economy-wide perspective, rather than a single-industry approach. For example, excluding foreign insurance companies may protect domestic insurers, but could lead to increased dependence on foreign re-insurers, higher costs for industry and an outflow of re-insurance premiums. The report urges developing countries to be sceptical of arguments in favour of increased barriers to trade, such as the need to protect an infant industry. However, where a sector is thought too economically or politically sensitive to allow foreign majority ownership, it recommends allowing joint ventures in preference to outright prohibition of market access. The timing of reform is important too, the handbook says. Stabilisation efforts, particularly mechanisms to avoid the overvaluation of the domestic currency, should precede liberalisation. The handbook was prepared by staff of the Unctad programme on transnational corporations and the international trade division of the World Bank international economics department.

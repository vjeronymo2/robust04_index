			<p><P> August 23, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INITIATIVE PLANNED AGAINST FLUOROCARBONS  </P> <P> After two separate bills were stalled until next year, Assemblyman Tom Hayden  (D-Santa Monica) said Tuesday he will sponsor a voter initiative for 1990 that  would stringently regulate atmosphere-damaging chemicals in air conditioners.  </P> <P> Hayden's bill, which would have prohibited the sale of chlorofluorocarbons in  small cans and require it to be recycled under strict guidelines, was held over  by the Senate Natural Resources Committee.  </P> <P> "(The committee) has got to be crazy to do this," Hayden said. "This is  guaranteed to become an initiative. But their action didn't surprise me at  all."  </P> <P> He said polls he had commissioned indicate that as many as 75% of California  voters would support an initiative that would more closely regulate use of  chlorofluorocarbons -- even if it affected use of air conditioners.  </P> <P> Chlorofluorocarbons have been targeted by scientists as a major villain in the  increasing depletion of the Earth's protective ozone layer. Ozone filters out  harmful ultraviolet sunlight that can cause skin cancer.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, an even broader bill carried by Assemblyman John Vasconcellos that  would ban the sale of automobiles with air-conditioning units using the  chemical after 1992, was held over in the Assembly Environmental Safety and  Toxic Materials Committee.  </P> <P> But Vasconcellos (D-Santa Clara) urged the environmental safety committee to  hold a forum on banning use of the chemical.  </P> <P> "Let's call for a summit meeting . . . with all the appropriate leaders and  parties. Let's make it clear that this is a serious issue," said Vasconcellos.  </P> <P> Vasconcellos received verbal support for his bill -- but the Assembly members  said they wanted to study the issue further. With the lawmakers adjourning on  Sept. 15, that means the issue is dead at least until next year.  </P></p>

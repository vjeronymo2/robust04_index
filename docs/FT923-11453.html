			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / New shadow cabinet members for John Smith's 'dream team' Mr John Smith, the new Labour leader, yesterday won what amounts to a 'dream team' in the highly-volatile lottery of the shadow cabinet elections. The make-up of the new parliamentary leadership reflects a growing shift towards what is widely becoming known as the 'modernising' faction of the party with women and southerners getting a slightly larger share of the cake. A younger generation - comprising Ms Harriet Harman, Ms Marjorie Mowlam and Mr Chris Smith - can all be deemed Smith loyalists. The full result of the shadow cabinet election was: Gordon Brown 165 votes, Tony Blair 150, Robin Cook 149, Frank Dobson 140, John Prescott 137, Bryan Gould 135, Harriet Harman 135, Marjorie Mowlam 135, Chris Smith 135, Ann Clwyd 133,Ann Taylor 129, Jack Cunningham 124, Michael Meacher 122, Donald Dewar 121, David Blunkett 112, Jack Straw 111, Tom Clarke 105, David Clark 104. Harriet Harman Robin Cook's well-established deputy on the high-profile shadow health portfolio and already one of the best-known of Labour's frontbench spokespeople. Ms Harman is too uncompromising in her campaigning for women's rights for some of the more unreconstructed male chauvinists in Labour's ranks but she will be a key figure in the party's bid to woo more of the female vote. She is approaching her tenth anniversary as MP for the down-at-heel inner London seat of Peckham and has an enviable reputation as a diligent constituency worker. A leftwinger of the Meacherite rather than the Bennite school. Tom Clarke Affable MP for Monklands West who has the advantage over his shadow cabinet colleagues of sharing a constituency border with his party leader. Mr Clarke is arguably the least well-known of the new leadership outside Westminster but he built a reputation as an efficient second-ranking spokesman on health affairs, having served as the backbench foreign affairs committee chairman from 1983-86. He is centre-right, Roman Catholic, devolutionist and a Scottish moralist and he will be a doggedly loyal supporter of his friend, Mr John Smith, when the going gets rough. David Blunkett His breakthrough into the shadow cabinet at the fourth attempt should give him an opportunity to demonstrate that he has more than one string to his bow. He is MP for Sheffield Brightside and has been a frontbench environment spokesman. He is Britain's third blind MP, has served on Labour's national executive committee since 1983 and ran Mr Bryan Gould's ill-starred leadership campaign. He described the sell-off of the water authorities as 'probably the most disgraceful act of a government intent on turning Britain into an auctioneer's paradise'. Chris Smith Conscientious Islington South and Finsbury MP and previously the Number Three in the Smith-Beckett shadow Treasury team. He did his prospects no harm by successfully moving the controversial recent amendment to raise MPs' office expense allowances by 38 per cent. He is the only MP openly to have declared his homosexuality. Mr Smith increased his once slender majority by 9,800 votes in the last general election. A softish left intellectual, he co-sponsored Mr Tony Benn's 1989 bill to disestablish the Church of England. Marjorie Mowlam A trojan of Labour's ultimately futile so-called prawn cocktail offensive. She is an industrious former college lecturer who made a good fist of shadowing the tricky City and corporate affairs portfolio without ever giving the impression of having found her metier. She was among the first members of the parliamentary intake of 1987 to be appointed to the front bench as a Northern Ireland spokeswoman four years ago. MP for the industrial north-east constituency of Redcar, she is well-placed now to turn her attentions to a bigger spending department.</p>

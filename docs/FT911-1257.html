			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / Ban urged on mortgage service tie-in THE LAW Society has called on the government to impose a market-wide ban on the tying-in of financial services to residential property loans, writes Robert Rice. The society says a ban would promote competition between financial institutions, which from next year will be able to provide conveyancing services to their borrowers, and protect consumers by offering them a choice in selecting the services needed to buy or sell a house. The government proposes, under the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990, to allow the tying-in of services provided consumers are given written cautions. The society says this 'half-hearted approach' gives consumers no clear rights to buy mortgage, insurance, estate agency and conveyancing services from separate providers at separately identified prices.</p>

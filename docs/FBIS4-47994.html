			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by IEC Chairman Judge Johann Kriegler and </F> IEC Commissioners Advocate Dikgang Moseneke and Professor Jorgen  Elklit at Gallagher Estate, Midrand -- live]    [Text] [Kriegler] We have reached a milestone in the  history of our country. Barely four years ago, after decades of  strife and dissent, we struck a bold course for the future.  Just over four months ago the Independent Electoral Commission  [IEC] was created. Its task was well nigh superhuman: to  organize, administer, supervise, and conduct our country's  first, wholly democratic elections. Many said it would be  impossible, and it very nearly was. We had the will but not the  time.    The election we offered to the people of our country was  admittedly flawed in many ways, but that is peripheral. Some 20  million people of this land were granted the opportunity of a  say in our future government. They have spoken and  notwithstanding manifold difficulties the commission is proud to  be able to announce the results. More significantly, we have  concluded that we can certify each of the 10 elections  concerned, to have been substantially free and fair. This we  are able to do despite the large number of objections and  complaints from various political parties. The campaign period  was relatively peaceful. Complaints arising in this regard were  investigated, mediated, or prosecuted. Viewed in the context of  historical animosities, political, social, and ethnic,  campaigning was relatively free. Through the electoral fund  parties were enabled to conduct effective electioneering. Our  program to provide access to so-called no-go areas stretched  across the land from the Letsitele valley to the far reaches of  the Richtersveld. At the same time voter education was  coordinated and directed towards those sectors of our community  which needed it most. The low percentage of spoilt papers bears  testimony to the success of these efforts. A vigorous  communications program served to focus attention on the  elections to establish the secrecy of the vote and in this way  to counteract intimidation. Indeed on the voting days  intimidation was not a major feature.    The task of furnishing reasonably accessible, yet secure  voting stations, proved intractable, and many compromises had to  be made. Political developments and a number of formal  self-governing or independent territories, compounded the task.  Less than a week before voting was due to commence 500 voting  stations had to be identified, staffed, equipped, and secured in  KwaZulu.    In order to promote inclusivity, a crash program for the  issuing of temporary voter cards had to be launched and 80  million stickers had to be printed and distributed to serve  9,000 localities. Some 200,000 officials designedly drawn from  the community at large, had to be trained and retrained. The  voters joyfully turned out in their millions on 27 April -- our  administration proved unequal to the task, but we managed to  pull back from disaster by the efforts of many, both inside and  outside the IEC [Independent Electoral Commission]. The  electorate was still offered a reasonable opportunity to vote.  When it came to counting the strain again proved too much.    Once again disaster was narrowly averted and emergency  measures to identify and verify approximately 40 million ballot  papers, were introduced. Alleged electoral violations occurring  during the voting and counting periods of the elections will be  investigated and where appropriate, prosecuted. We acknowledge  that the measures we took displeased many. The heart of the  matter is that we were able to establish the expressed will of  the people with reasonable accuracy. We are satisfied that the  results we are about to announce were established in  substantially free and fair elections.    In three respects the commission used the powers vested in  it  by Section 47 of the Electoral Act. One, at the counting  station in Lady Frere, Eastern Cape, there was adequate evidence  that approximately 30 ballot boxes had been forcibly opened. In  consequence the commission decided to cause 50,000 votes in the  provincial election, and 50,000 in the national, to be deducted  from all the competing parties, proportionally; two, the  unavailability of stickers at many voting stations, during a  part of the voting days, technically rendered votes cast during  such periods, invalid. Special instructions were given to avoid  such eventuality, which would have disenfranchised voters to the  prejudice of their parties of choice.    The commission is satisfied that substantial justice would  be  done if the votes cast in favor of parties on such invalid  papers, were by way of adjustment, equated to the number  thereof; three, certain counting station data relating to  KwaZulu-Natal could not be verified with the requisite degree  and reliability. The commission is satisfied that it would be a  fair and reasonably reliable test of the votes of that province,  to adjust the verifiable information proportionally to the  proven support of the respective parties in that province.    We intend announcing the results in the following order:  First, I will read out the national results, mainly total votes  and percentages, thereafter, I will ask my colleague, Professor  Jorgen Elklit, to deal with the seat allocations in respect of  the national election, and I will then ask my colleague, Dikgang  Moseneke, to read all of the provincial results, also in  numerical tallies, and in percentages.    The national results are as follows:    IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party]: 2,158,294 votes, 10.54 percent    PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress]: 243,478 votes, 1.25 percent)    Soccer Party: 10,575 votes, 0.05 percent;    Keep It Straight, Simple Party: 5,916 votes, 0.03 percent;    Freedom Front [FF]: 424,556 votes, 2.17 percent;    Women's Rights Peace Party [WRPP]: 6,434 votes, 0.03  percent;    Workers' List Party [WLP]: 4,169 votes, 0.02 percent;    Ximoko Progressive Party [XPP]: 6,320 votes, 0.03 percent;    African Muslim Party [AMP]: 34,466 votes, 0.18 percent;    African Christian Democratic Party [ACDP]: 88,104 votes,  0.45 percent;    ADM [African Democratic Movement]: 9,886 votes, 0.05  percent;    African Moderates Congress Party [AMCP]: 27,690 votes,  0.14 percent;    African National Congress: 12,237,655 votes, 62.65 percent;    DP [Democratic Party]: 338,426 votes, 1.73 percent;    Dikwankwetla Party of South Africa [DPSA]: 19,451 votes,  0.10 percent    FP [Federal Party]: 17,663 votes, 0.09 percent;    LUSAP [Luso-South Africa Party]: 3,293 votes, 0.02 percent;    MF [Minority Front]: 13,433 votes, 0.07 percent    NP [National Party]: 3,983,690 votes, 20.39 percent;    Total: 19,533,497    Spoiled papers: 193,081    Percentage: 0.99 percent    [Elklit] I will not take you through the allocation rules  of the new South African electoral system, but I want to stress  that in my opinion it is a very fair proportional representation  system which has been applied in this election. I will indicate  to you the number of seats allocated to the various parties on  the basis of the vote figures which Judge Kriegler has just read  to you.    Pan-Africanist Congress: 5 seats;    Vryheidsfront/Freedom Front: 9 seats;    African Christian Democratic Party: 2 seats;    African National Congress: 252 seats;    Democratic Party: 7 seats;    National Party/Nationale Party: 82 seats;    Inkatha Freedom Party: 43 seats;    Together: 400 seats.

			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / O&amp;Y debt shake-up may take two years THE reorganisation of Olympia and York's Dollars 20bn (Pounds 11.5bn) debt is likely to take two years because of the complex structure of the Canadian property developer, according to an executive with close knowledge of O&amp;Y. This emerged yesterday as bankers flew to Toronto for their first meeting since O&amp;Y admitted last weekend that it was suffering from a 'liquidity crisis'. O&amp;Y has called a meeting of its 20 biggest bank lenders, which will take place today. The purpose of the meeting is to agree a process for reorganising the debt, totalling more than Dollars 20bn, and elect a steering committee, to represent all of O&amp;Y's more than 100 banks. The co-chairmen of the committee are expected to include Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Citicorp, and Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp. CIBC is understood to have the biggest exposure, more than Dollars 1bn, to O&amp;Y. Bankers said that the second biggest lender, with around Dollars 750m of loans, is Royal Bank of Canada, followed by Citicorp, with Dollars 500m. Hongkong Bank's exposure is thought to be comparable to Citicorp's. Other big lenders are understood to include Credit Lyonnais, the French bank, with Dollars 350m, Canada's Bank of Nova Scotia and Bank of Montreal, with Dollars 300m each, and Chemical Bank of the US with Dollars 200m. In the UK, Barclays' exposure to O&amp;Y's UK properties, principally the Canary Wharf development in east London, is thought to be around Dollars 100m. However, its overall exposure to the group is believed to be much bigger. O&amp;Y is moving fast to reassure lenders to the Pounds 3bn Canary Wharf project - Europe's biggest new property development has had its prospects damaged by the UK property recession. Mr Tom Johnson, who was appointed to oversee the financial restructuring early this week as new president of Olympia and York Property Developments, O&amp;Y's main operating subsidiary, is scheduled to arrive in London on Sunday night to hold talks with lenders. Canary Wharf has Pounds 700m of debt, consisting of a Pounds 490m facility from 11 banks - led by Credit Suisse and Lloyds - Pounds 100m from the European Investment Bank and a Pounds 52m emergency short-term loan provided last week by a group of banks led by Barclays and Lloyds.

			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Great Portland plans 20% dividend cut Great Portland Estates, a leading property company which has diversified from its traditional central London base in recent years, plans to cut its dividend for the first time in its 35-year history, writes Vanessa Houlder. A recommended final payment of 5.3p will make a total of 8p against 9.7p a year earlier. The 20 per cent cut had been flagged previously and the shares closed down only 7p at 196p. The cut was proposed because the redevelopment of one property and sale of others had caused a Pounds 6m reduction in gross rental income. Overall, rental income was flat at Pounds 87.3m. The company said, however, it was likely to increase the dividend again in the current year. Pre-tax profits for the year to March fell to Pounds 25.4m from Pounds 34.04m a year earlier but would have been flat but for a Pounds 9.7m charge for renegotiating a syndicated loan and associated swap arrangement. Earnings per share after the charge and a higher tax rate fell to 5.5p from 11.3p adjusted for last June's rights issue. Net asset value rose 21 per cent from 172p to 209p. The reported asset value was below most analysts' forecasts. County NatWest, brokers, said it expected Great Portland to post a net asset value of 240p next year. It expected the dividend to rise by 10 per cent to 8.8p. The company's investment portfolio was valued at March 31 at Pounds 1.04bn, representing after capital expenditure, an increase of 14 per cent and a running yield of 8.75 per cent. In the latest year, central London accounted for 57 per cent of the portfolio against 84 per cent in 1989, and retail space for 33 per cent (13 per cent). Generation of increased earnings, and thereby dividends, remains one of the group's top priorities, said Mr Richard Peskin, chairman.</p>

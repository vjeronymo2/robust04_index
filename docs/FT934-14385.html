			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / How To Spend It: The in-crowd Out of Africa - Lucia van der Post picks the best to beat the bush THE GREAT FT elephant safari is back and all of us who were lucky enough to wander through the wild spaces of Kenya and Tanzania with Iain and Oria Douglas-Hamilton as our guides felt that we found something of the Africa we had dreamt of in the months before. We could not escape the Land Rovers or the small aircraft that flew us about, but in our remote tented camps we could nurture the illusion that we were alone with all Africa around us. We could get to know a small portion of Africa: its soil, its plants, its wildlife, its birds and its people. Day after day we set out to find elephants, to see the chimps with our expert, Roland Purcell, to walk along rivers and up ridges with our Masaai guides, to picnic under trees, to look for cheetah and lion, and we found enough and did enough for us all to feel that we had had a privileged glimpse of a world that has been hugely threatened but seems now to be fighting back. We learned to adjust to African time and that lunch and dinners could wait when there were herds of elephant or flights of spoon-billed storks to be gazed at. And some of us learned the hard way that when you head for the bush it is surprising how little you need, but what you need you cannot do without. Times have changed since the necessities required by a young man setting out for Africa (as Tricia Foley tells us in her beautiful book Colonial Style) comprised 40 different objects including khaki ties, a wool bush shirt, leather leggings, a green canvas bucket, a folding chair of green canvas with leg rests, a compact chair bath and wash-stand that fits into a bag, a fitted cook's case, a steel helmet case and two hurricane lamps. Victorian ladies, too, had their own necessities. Agnes and Cecily Herbert, for instance, in their African venture, wore 'knickerbockers, gaiters, stout English shooting boots and khaki safari jackets, the wide pockets busy with string, knives and other handy aids. When particularly delicate stalking was required, Mary would remove her boots and hunt in her stockinged feet.' These days our needs are simpler but it is still possible to get it wrong. The classic mistakes are to dress as if going to a theme party. This means, in my experience, avoiding anything with the label 'safari' attached to it. Khaki and shades of green and beige are to my mind the most attractive colours to wear in the bush, and there is nothing to beat proper cotton. The Gap stores, for instance, now stock sand-washed khaki trousers at Pounds 30 for men and Pounds 28 for women, as well as good dark khaki shirts at Pounds 32. Those who want to pay more and like a fancier label can browse through the Polo Range at Ralph Lauren. Marks and Spencer often has good khaki cotton shirts and sweaters and Blazer has yielded some wonderful, if pricey, goodies. When it comes to women, forget Meryl Streep - keep your Out of Africa gear for looking glamorous on the patio. What you need are well-cut beige or khaki shorts - most of the middle-market labels such Stefanel, Liz Claiborne and Marks and Spencer do them in the summer. I also have a pair from Banana Republic - sadly not what it was in its idiosyncratic heyday but still worth visiting whenever you are in the US. Good khaki shirts are harder to find so buy them when you see them. Good khaki T-shirts are easier - the best-wearing I found were by Jil Sander at the surprisingly good price of Pounds 15. If you keep your eyes skinned in everyday chain stores you will be able to buy yourself a perfectly satisfactory wardrobe at comfortable prices. The new breed of mail order companies, such as Racing Green (tel: 0345-331177 for a catalogue, or visit the new flagship store at 193-197 Regent Street, London W1) and Lands' End (tel: 0800-220106), which specialise in classy basics, are good sources. You need at least one really warm sweater and, ideally, a wind-cheater. The fleecy jackets from Patagonia (dubbed Patagucci because of its cult status and vertiginous prices) are marvellously soft and warm, but they look less at home to me in Africa than they do in the Alps. Hats, for us ozone-phobic Northerners, are essential. About hats there lurks a special culture - as the travel writer Jan Morris has pointed out, real travellers need a certain touch of loucheness about their dress. This can most satisfactorily be provided by a hat. Felt hats, Saba Douglas-Hamilton, Ian and Oria's 23-year-old daughter, tells me are the thing. As one of the quirky old Banana Republic catalogues put it: 'The point of owning a fur felt is to use it over a lifetime - as the years go by, it grows softer and softer, takes on more and more of your personality. Your fur felt hat will still be sitting rakishly on your head when your old favourite jeans have long since gone to denim heaven.' A good felt hat can be bought at The Survival Shop, 11 Western Colonnade, Euston Station, London, NW1 for Pounds 59.95, though to pass the Saba test I dare say you should duff it up a bit. For the young set 23-year-old Saba Douglas-Hamilton provided me with some insider tips on what the Kenya kids consider proper gear. The first thing to remember is that the way the Kenya kids or the Kenya cowboys dress has evolved around a cult of toughness. Short shorts of heavy duty cotton khaki and short-sleeved khaki shirts are standard gear. The guides in the camps never, ever, don a sweater. Only cissies, it seems, feel the cold. Feet, they would like you to think, have been hardened by years in the bush so the old game department shoes called chapleys or 'thousand milers' (made out of bits of old tyres and worn by the Masaai, who like them best if the bit of tyre at the back still has the number on it) are the chicest way to clad your feet. Chapleys cost about Pounds 10 from Patambacoda in Nairobi. They are made from two pieces of leather crossed at the front, leaving much of the foot exposed to scratches, mosquito and tsetse fly bites, not to mention snake-bites - and anybody who has read Kuki Gallmann's beautiful saga of Kenyan life, I Dreamed of Africa, will remember that this is a matter in which Saba is well-versed. On no account wear socks. If you cannot quite match up to these levels of toughness then safari boots from a Bata shoe shop will do. Women should wear battered straw hats which they can customise with scarves wound round them (though not leopard-spotted ones). A good plain leather belt or a beaded Masaai one (Pounds 9.99 from Africraft in the Africa Centre, 38, King Street, London WC2) holds up the shorts and on it you hang a Leatherman knife. Kenyan kids wear leather thongs around the neck, sometimes with little pendants, twisted copper bracelets or Masaai beaded ones round the wrists, all found in the Nairobi markets. In the evenings, no matter how remote the camp, Kenyan kids shine. Saba would wear something long, simple and slinky that came out of her little holdall, wrap a shawl around her shoulders, put on some zany ear-rings and look a million dollars. Zoe Fuller at Roland Purcell's camp was wondrously clever with kikois, the traditional multi-purpose bright cotton wrap that is found all over East Africa. It is well worth packing two or three. Pounds 22.50 from Davies, 10 Great Newport Street, London WC2 or Pounds 11.99 from Africraft in the Africa Centre. Shawls are the quickest, most glamorous way to wrap up in the evening and can, if you choose the right one, do double duty in the chilly early mornings. Chaps either wear shorts and cotton shirts or also do clever things with kikois.</p>

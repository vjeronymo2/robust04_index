			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HANDYMAN Q&amp;A: WOODWORK NOVICE MIGHT CONSIDER KITS  </P> <P> QUESTION: I like the look of period reproduction furniture with elaborate  detailing. I'm just getting into woodworking and I'd like to try to build some  of these interesting pieces. My problem is that my woodworking skills aren't  what you'd call "polished" at this point. Do you have any project suggestions?  </P> <P> ANSWER: Kit furniture is one way to get the satisfaction of making the pieces  you want when you have limited woodworking skills. You'll also save  considerably over the cost of the same item that's assembled and finished.  </P> <P> A large variety of period kit pieces available from various manufacturers  include roll-top oak desks, Queen Anne highboys and even four-poster canopy  beds.  </P> <P> Most kit furniture is easy to assemble as pieces are usually precut and  sometimes sanded. Some manufacturers claim you can complete a chair in less  than an hour and make a full chest of drawers (minus the finishing) in five  hours.  </P> <P> Cracks in Marble Sink Beyond Repair  </P> <P> Q: Our cultured marble sink has developed tiny surface cracks that have  spiraled out from the strainer and now they are getting longer. What can cause  this and is there a fix?  </P> <P> A: Surface cracks near the drain can be caused by very hot water or  over-tightening the drain fitting with a wrench rather than making it  hand-tight.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, the cracks cannot be repaired.  </P> <P> Condensation Forms in Bathroom Duct  </P> <P> Q: I recently installed an exhaust fan in my bathroom, which I vented in the  ridge vent. I must be having a condensation problem because I get a lot of  water pouring out of the fan duct. How can I correct this?  </P> <P> A: You're right on target. Condensation is occurring in the flexible duct when  the warm moist air from the bathroom comes in contact with the colder air  inside the duct. Usually the exhaust fan can move the air out fast enough to  prevent condensation but this is not happening in your case.  </P> <P> Try reducing the length of the flexible duct. This will result in a higher  temperature of the discharging air, which may be enough to eliminate  condensation. If this fails, your problem can be solved by insulating the duct.  </P> <P> For further information write to Popular Mechanics, Readers Service Bureau, 224  W. 57th St., New York, N.Y. 10019.  </P> <P> </P></p>

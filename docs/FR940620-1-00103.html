			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Mr. Robert Jacobsen (see above address), telephone (303) 236&hyph;8189. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Four native fish species that inhabit the Colorado River Basin are federally listed as endangered: the Colorado sqawfish ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Ptychocheilus lucius <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), humpback chub ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Gila cypha <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), bonytail ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Gila elegans <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), and razorback sucker ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Xyrauchen texanus <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). Each of these four species was once abundant in the Upper Basin; however, they have declined in numbers and are now threatened with extinction from their natural habitat. Factors accounting for the current status of these species include direct loss of habitat, changes in water flow and temperature regimes, blockage of migration routes, and interactions with introduced (nonnative) fish species. The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) has maintained since 1978 that a jeopardy situation exists in the upper Colorado River basin and that actions must be taken to reverse the decline of endangered fish populations and habitat. The Service has described this conclusion through section 7 of the Endangered Species Act (Act) in over 224 biological opinions on project impacts on the endangered fish in the Upper Basin. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1988, the Governors of Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming, the Secretary of the Interior, and the Administrator of the Western Area Power Administration entered into a cooperative agreement to implement the Recovery Implementation Program for Endangered Fish Species in the Upper Colorado River Basin (Recovery Program). The purpose of the Recovery Program is to recover the four endangered fish in the Upper Colorado River Basin while providing for future water development to proceed in compliance with the Endangered Species Act, Interstate Compacts, and State law. Participants in the Recovery Program include the Service, the Bureau of Reclamation, the States of Utah, Wyoming, and Colorado, the Western Area Power Administration (Western), and representatives of the water development interests and conservation groups. The Colorado River Energy Distributors Association is a nonvoting member of the Recovery Program. The ultimate goal of the Recovery Program is to recover and delist the endangered fishes in the Upper Basin by restoring and establishing self-sustaining populations and protecting sufficient habitat to support these populations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Recovery Program also outlines procedures for section 7 consultations. the Service raised an issue with the Recovery Program participants as to whether progress toward recovery of the fish has been sufficient to allow for the continued issuance of favorable biological opinions. Discussions among the Recovery Program participants resulted in an agreement, which was finalized on October 15, 1993, that clarified how section 7 consultations would be conducted on depletion impacts related to new projects and impacts associated with historic projects (existing projects requiring a new Federal action) in the Upper Basin. The Recovery Implementation Program Recovery Action Plan (RIPRAP) was developed by the Recovery Program participants using the best information available and the recovery goals established for the four endangered fish species. It identifies specific actions and timeframes currently believed to be required to recover the endangered fish in the most expeditious manner possible in the Upper Basin. The RIPRAP also serves as a measure of accomplishment so the Recovery Program can continue to serve as the reasonable and prudent alternative to avoid the likelihood of jeopardy to the continued existence of the endangered fishes for projects undergoing section 7 consultations. The Service also intends that the Recovery Program will serve as the reasonable and prudent alternative which avoids the likely destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat. The final rule determining critical habitat for the endangered fishes was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on March 21, 1994, and the final designation became effective on April 20, 1994. The proposed changes continued in the modified RIPRAP are designed to fulfill such intent. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat is defined at 50 CFR 402.02 as a direct or indirect alternation that appreciably diminishes the value of critical habitat for both the survival and recovery of a listed species. Section 7 consultation is initiated by a Federal Agency when its action may affect critical habitat by impacting any of the primary constituent elements or reduce the potential of critical habitat to develop those elements. The Primary constituent elements determined necessary for survival and recovery of the four Colorado River endangered fishes include, but are not limited to, water, physical habitat, and biological environment as defined in the final rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many of the specific actions in the existing RIPRAP not only contribute to allowing the Recovery Program to continue to serve as the reasonable and prudent alternative to avoid the likelihood of jeopardy to the continued existence of the endangered fishes, but also will avoid the likely destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat for the endangered fishes. Therefore, the proposed additions and changes to the RIPRAP which the Service believes are necessary for the Recovery Program to continue to serve as the reasonable and prudent alternative for projects undergoing section 7 consultations are not extensive. The proposed modifications are primarily intended to provide further definition to already identified recovery actions in the RIPRAP and to provide increased certainty that the Recovery Program can continue to serve as the reasonable and prudent alternative for projects subject to section 7 consultations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A programmatic Environmental Assessment was completed on the Recovery Program in November 1987. The Environmental Assessment provides an analysis and assessment of the impacts to the environment from Recovery Program implementation. The October 1993 Agreement and RIPRAP, including the proposed changes, identify in more detail how the Recovery Program will be carried out. Appropriate site specific NEPA compliance will be conducted on specific actions identified in the RIPRAP. <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

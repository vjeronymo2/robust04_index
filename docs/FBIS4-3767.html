RENMIN RIBAO and XINHUA already have sent reporting teams to  Qiandao Lake to cover the story. In light of the requirement to  "seek truth from facts," they will cover the news jointly and  will present the truth of the matter to the public at home and  abroad.    During an interview given to a reporter, an official in  charge of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan  Straits [ARATS] said that ARATS had already send a message to  the Straits Exchange Foundation [SEF], giving a detailed account  of the Qiandao Lake incident. Throughout the handling of the  Qiandao Lake incident, the official said, ARATS has played a  role of offering information to the SEF and of passing on the  SEF's messages to the relevant mainland departments. ARATS  already has proposed the SEF that the two organizations will  hold a routine meeting as quickly as possible to discuss the  question of protecting the lives and property of compatriots on  both sides of the strait. As ARATS is not authorized to handle  the question of compensating the victims of the Qiandao Lake  incident, he said, Taiwan's travel agency and the victims'  relatives should consult with the mainland insurance company and  travel agency on the matter.</p>

			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / Management: Making local heroes international - Percy Barnevik, president and chief executive of ABB, offers advice on building multinational teams for a global company / Tips from the top Any multinational approach to management has to start from the top. Thus, ABB's supervisory board of eight includes four nationalities; and its eight-man executive committee is made up of German, Swedish, Swiss, American and Danish executives. At group headquarters some 150 people represent more than 20 nationalities. The group's 50 global business area managers hail from countries such as Brazil, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Italy, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK and the US. Every one of them in turn leads a team of local managers, each with responsibilities for day-to-day operations in a different country. For instance, a German based in Switzerland with global responsibility for a business area has among his team local managers in Italy, Germany, Sweden, the US, Norway, India, Saudi Arabia and the Czech Republic. As business gets more globalised, the competitive advantages of multinational teams increase. Any single-nationality corporate culture will run into problems as soon as it aims to integrate larger operations from other countries. In contrast, once the initial hurdles are overcome - which is no easy task and takes a lot of painstaking effort - multinational teams offer major benefits. Their combined understanding and insight into global and local business problems are much deeper. Benchmarking of operational performance on an international scale becomes routine. Rotation of specialists across borders to transfer best practices runs into far fewer problems and, for example, international supply contracts across borders and joint development projects become the norm. Multinational teams can make unique use of their complementary skills and backgrounds. So ABB could exploit Finnish and German experience in dealing with Russians, longstanding Austrian relationships with Hungarians and Slovenians, traditional Scandinavian links with the Baltic states and Poland, when expanding into central and eastern European markets. Now, with established positions in Poland and the Czech Republic, new team members from these countries help in building the group's presence further east. Similarly, ABB uses Chinese-speaking team members from Singapore, Hong Kong or Taiwan in developing operations in China, or Brazilians and Argentines in pursuing its Latin American expansion. An important side-benefit is that we are able to recruit future global managers from the world. ABB prides itself on being multi-domestic. The group has deep roots in many countries, respects national differences and cultures, and aims to achieve a strong local identity in each of its many home markets. At the same time, we strive to develop a global corporate culture for all members of our multi-national teams. One key element is having a common language. English was chosen at the outset, although a minority of the present 218,000 employees have English as their mother language. Today, all executives use English as their common language and ABB's currency for global reporting and consolidation is the US dollar. Most importantly, from the very beginning ABB established a common set of values, policies and operational guidelines to safeguard and promote a group-wide umbrella culture. Multinational teams do not happen naturally - on the contrary, the human inclination is to stick to its own kind. If in selecting a manager the choice is between a compatriot with a familiar background, and a foreigner whose credentials appear strange and whose language is difficult to understand, objective criteria tend to lose out. Competence is the key selection criterion, not passport. Therefore, it is occasionally necessary to interfere in the selection process, to force people to overcome the 'foreigner' hurdle and safeguard the ideal of multinational teams. The value derived from the combined different backgrounds makes it well worth taking some risks. Few people have by natural instinct the ability to work well within such teams. It takes patience, understanding and ability to communicate. One important route to developing effective team members is to transfer employees to other countries. I am not thinking so much of young people who spend six to 12 months abroad as part of their training and development, nor of the hundreds of people from newly acquired companies in former Comecon or Asian countries, who every year learn about modern company operations and get introduced to ABB's values and policies in western Europe and North America. What I have primarily in mind is young western Europeans being transferred to Asia or America, and North Americans being assigned to Europe, Asia or Latin America. When after some years they return home, they have got a deeper insight into different cultures, and may even have picked up another language. They will have learned that their own culture is not always the measure for all things. While such transfers on a massive scale may be costly, they are important for the development of effective multinational team members and global managers. The common denominators in these efforts are communication, understanding and patience. There is no question that the price to pay for a high degree of 'multi-nationality' is a major investment in two-way communication and consensus building across borders. Even after making full use of technical means of communication, a significant amount of time must still be invested throughout the organisation in face-to-face meetings and team work. In the final analysis, openness, trust and respect are the key words in all this. At the end of the day, all people are 'local' with their roots in some home country. It therefore takes a major, systematic and sustained effort to bridge the borders, build the multinational teams and thereby create a truly international organisation. But it is well worthwhile.

Provided  the referendum is positive, this would give the go-ahead for  Austria to join the European Union [EU] as of 1 January 1995.    Kinkel was essentially involved in the success of the EU  negotiations. Every time the talks were stalling, he provided a  new impetus with proposals for a compromise.    [Kopeinig] Minister, will there be a breakthrough for Norway  during the forthcoming EU negotiations -- and thus a solution to  the institutional issue?    [Kinkel] I will do everything for the negotiations to be  concluded successfully for Norway, too. I am still optimistic.  It must not and cannot be that the expansion fails because of a  few thousand tonnes of fish or because of the institutional  question, important though this is.    [Kopeinig] Have you received any signals that Great Britain  and Spain are willing to give in regarding the raising of the  blocking minority?    [Kinkel] I am in permanent contact with my colleagues Hurd  and Solana. Both countries want expansion, but the British  Government is under domestic pressure. It is quite clear that  the blocking minority must be raised from 23 to 27 votes. The  European Parliament will not agree to the membership treaties as  long as the blocking minority has not been raised.    [Kopeinig] London continues to insist on 23 votes. Where do  you see a compromise in this respect?    [Kinkel] A solution could emerge by coming to a temporary  settlement with 27 votes until the government conference in 1996  and by making a final decision only in 1996.    [Kopeinig] What do you expect of Austria as a future EU  member?    [Kinkel] Austria is highly welcome in the EU. As a state in  the center of Europe, it will contribute its political vitality,  its economic capacity, and its culture to the EU and it will  constructively participate in shaping this Europe, which is  subjected to great changes as a result of the disappearance of  the East-West conflict. Austria, Sweden, Finland, and Norway  belong in this EU. In the future all members must master the  common tasks with a readiness for compromise and in the European  spirit.</p>

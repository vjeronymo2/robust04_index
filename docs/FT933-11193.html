			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / UK Company News: John Gunn returns to the corporate fray A DEAL announced yesterday features Mr John Gunn, former chief executive of British and Commonwealth Holdings, the financial services group that collapsed two years ago. It also provides a UK vehicle for the media interests of Mr Clive Ng, the Malaysian entrepreneur who has large cable television interests in Asia through United International Holdings. The USM-quoted Wilton Group has agreed to sell a 35.6 per cent stake in its main quoted subsidiary, Glenchewton, formerly Cowan de Groot, to a group of investors which includes Mr Gunn. He will be joined on the board of Glenchewton by two former colleagues - Mr Matt McBride, who will become chief executive, and Mr Allan Jonnes , who will be finance director. Mr McBride is a former founder director of Bricom Group, the industrial conglomerate which was the subject of a Pounds 359m buy-out from British &amp; Commonwealth Holdings in 1988, and Mr Jonnes is the former chief executive of Bricom. Glenchewton currently imports and distributes toys, household goods and basketware. Mr McBride said the company was unlikely to move towards the financial services area, in which Mr Gunn made his name, and would be more interested in manufacturing and business-to-business services. Another investor, Sir Victor Garland, a director of Throgmorton Trust and former director of Prudential Corporation, will become non-executive chairman of Glenchewton. Wilton, which owned 69.9 per cent of Glenchewton, has agreed to sell 9m shares - representing 35.6 per cent of the equity - at 19p per share for a total consideration of Pounds 1.9m. Glenchewton shares closed 2 1/2 p higher at 33 1/2 p. Mr Ng will take a maximum 28.48 per cent stake in Wilton. He will subscribe for 100m new shares at 1p and participate in a 1-for-2 rights issue at the same price which will raise Pounds 3.5m before expenses. He has also been granted an option over another 60m shares at 2p. Wilton shares yesterday closed  1/4 p lower at 1 1/4 p. Wilton said that in recognition of Mr Ng's substantial investment, he would join the board as an executive director and deputy chairman. Mr Michael Buckley, Wilton's chairman, said the group was interested in areas such as cable television and he expected that the involvement of Mr Ng would bring opportunities for Wilton to expand into media businesses worldwide. The combined proceeds from the rights issue will eliminate indebtedness at Wilton, which has now sold most of its former property portfolio. The group incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 810,000 in 1992, compared with a profit of Pounds 39,000 the previous year. Sales rose from Pounds 19.2m to Pounds 30.1m. Losses per share were 0.17p (0.002p). Once again, there was no dividend.</p>

Gritskova, Chair  of General Surgery, Thrapeutic Faculty, RGMU [expansion unknown]  ]    [Abstract] Experimental trials were conducted on 80-100  guinea pigs with interscapular wounds infected with 10E9 E. coli  K-11 cells to assess the therapeutic efficacy of a special  surgical dressing. The latter consisted of dioxydin or  terrilytin impregnated hydrophilic materials (HM; Ekran  Scientific Industrial Association). Actual treatment consisted  of application of the terrilytin-HM on the wound surface,  followed by an overlay of the dioxydin-HM dressing. The results  showed that the special combined HM dressing led to wound  sterilization in 3 days (0% mortality) , vs. 14 days in  control  animals (33% mortality) managed in a conventional manner.  Clinical benefits with the combined dressing also exceeded those  of dioxydin-HM dressing alone. However, although the length of  time required for complete epithiliazation did not differ in the  control and experimental groups, these observations suggest that  the combined HM may have application in human medicine in  controlling wound infections.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report under the "Hold the Front Page!" </F> column: "Authorities Try To See How Many of Us Still Remain"]    [Text] The Russian Government has decreed to hold in 1999  an all-Russia census. The need for such a count has arisen  owing to the country's deteriorating demographic situation  (climbing death rate, and so on), as well as to the increased  number of refugees and the homeless. Proceeding from the  census' results the government is going to draw up some specific  plans to improve the living in the country.</p>

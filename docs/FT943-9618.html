			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Crest equity settlement project on target Sir, I am disappointed by your newspaper's coverage of the Crest equity settlement project. Thus far, the Crest team has missed no deadline, made no change to its timetable for implementation, and has kept to its original budget projection. And yet the headline on August 4 said 'Further delays hit Crest system'. As the Bank has stated many times Crest is not operationally dependent upon a move to rolling settlement on a T+5 basis. The fact that the Stock Exchange will take no decision on the date of T+5 until October has been in the public domain for months. It has no bearing on the Crest timetable. The Crest project has been on time and on budget since the design phase started in August last year. Nothing has changed that picture. J R E Footman, head of the information division, Bank of England, Threadneedle Street, London EC2R 8AH</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 21 (CNA) -- Taiwan will continue to  promote agricultural cooperation with Indonesia despite recent  violent labor protests in Medan which later turned into a  highly- charged race riot against the economically dominant  ethnic Chinese, the Council of Agriculture (COA) said Thursday  [21 April].    "Agricultural cooperation will help boost economic  development in rural Indonesia, so it should not be affected by  the anti-ethnic Chinese sentiment in some Indonesian cities or  areas," said Chiu Yung-chung, director of the COA's Secretariat.    "As Taiwan has a wealth of experience in agricultural  development, Indonesia can benefit from cooperation with  Taiwan," he noted.    The cabinet-level council held a meeting to discuss the  promotion of agricultural cooperation with Southeast Asian  countries under the government's "southern strategy" which  encourages Taiwan businessmen to increase investment in  Southeast Asia instead of Mainland China.    The meeting decided that the council will organize a  delegation of agricultural experts and business executives to  visit Indonesia in June to seek possible cooperative projects  there.    Chiu said most COA officials agreed that Taiwan should  continue deep-sea fishing cooperation with Indonesia and that  shrimp raising has great market potential in that country.    The COA will also encourage Taiwan manufacturers to invest  in  fruit juice and sweetmeats production in Indonesia, Chiu noted.    Meanwhile, a Ministry of Economic Affairs official urged  local businessmen to carefully choose suitable locations before  they invest in Indonesia.    "Taiwan investors should choose regions where racism is less  serious and study local customs and culture in order to avoid  unnecessary troubles," the official said.    He pointed out although Indonesia has several advantages to  attract foreign investors, such as abundant natural resources  and labor force, foreign entrepreneurs face a host of problems  there, including persistent racism in some regions, a widening  gap between the rich and the poor, growing sentiment for labor  rights, red tape and factional squabbling within its government  agencies.    The official suggested that prospective Taiwan investors  choose suitable Indonesian or Overseas Chinese joint-venture  partners and seek to develop good relations with relevant  Indonesian officials.    Taiwan companies there should also promote as many  Indonesians as possible to factory management positions in order  to better understand the mentality of Indonesian workers, he  added.    Ethnic Chinese account for only 4 percent of the total  Indonesian population, but control 70 percent of the country's  economy. Ethnic Chinese, however, have little voice in the  Indonesian political arenas because of legal restrictions.    "It will be worthwhile to see how ethnic Chinese will  increase their clout in Indonesia's policy-making process," the  official said.</p>

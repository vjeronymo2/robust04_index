			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / Air Canada poised for expansion AIR CANADA is poised to become the North American link in a big international airline alliance after negotiating a merger with Canadian Airlines International, its main domestic rival. Mr Hollis Harris, Air Canada's chief executive, confirmed that the Montreal-based carrier has had discussions with Lufthansa and Air France in its pursuit of a deal with a European airline. Air France and Lufthansa have had close links with Canadian Airlines International in areas such as joint marketing and baggage handling. However, they declined to comment yesterday. Lufthansa said it 'has had discussions with everybody'. Air Canada expects to have a clearer idea soon of the chances of success for its recent bid, with a group of Texan investors, for control of Continental Airlines, the ailing US carrier. Air Canada also recently signed a marketing agreement with United Airlines, which it says will not be affected by its bid for Continental or by its plans for a link to a European carrier. Canadian Airlines' holding company, PWA Corporation of Calgary, agreed to a merger earlier this week after failing to conclude a deal with American Airlines. Plans for an employee buy-out also collapsed. Air Canada and PWA had combined revenues of CDollars 6.4bn (Pounds 2.66bn) last year, with 185 aircraft and 36,000 employees. They also control about a dozen commuter airlines in Canada. Both have been in the red for the past year and have a combined debt of about CDollars 3.6bn. The merged company will initially maintain the identity of both airlines but will seek to cut costs by sharing services and eliminating duplication of routes. The fleet is likely to shrink substantially, and Air Canada predicts that as many as 6,000 people will lose their jobs. The merger must still be cleared by the two companies' shareholders and by numerous regulatory agencies, including the competition bureau. An Air Canada official said yesterday that a comprehensive merger proposal should be finalised within the next month for presentation to the regulatory authorities.</p>

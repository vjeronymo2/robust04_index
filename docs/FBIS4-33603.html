			<p>BFN     [Text] Managua, 7 Jun (DPA) -- Approximately 30 former  Sandinist soldiers occupied the Venezuelan Embassy in Managua  this afternoon (local time), allegedly as a pressure tactic for  social and economic benefits from the administration of Violeta  Chamorro.    Initial reports indicate the occupiers, former Government  Ministry employees, were unarmed when they entered the embassy,  which is located approximately 10 km south of Managua in the  luxurious sector of Sierras de Santo Domingo.    Nicaraguan Foreign Ministry spokesmen say they have not  received official information regarding the occupation, and  Venezuelan Ambassador Juan Jose Monsant has not disclosed the  demands of the former soldiers.    Dozens of policemen have been deployed to the area  surrounding the Venezuelan Embassy.</p>

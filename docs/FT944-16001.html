			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Independent British Healthcare pulls float Independent British Health-care, which has 17 hospitals spread between Stirling in Scotland and Tunbridge Wells in Kent, has decided to pull its flotation. Mr Keith Chadwick, founder and chief executive, said yesterday that the group, which was hoping to float later this month with a market capitalisation of Pounds 45m, 'was not prepared to sell cheaply - it's that simple'. The market was not looking too clever, he added, and interest in the float was 'not massive'. He has written to the 2,400 shareholders, many of them doctors, telling them the flotation has been delayed. The group, which makes 80 per cent of its profits through private medical insurance, was planning to raise about Pounds 20m of new money through a placing. Beeson Gregory was both sponsor and broker. The money would have been used to reduce net debt of some Pounds 37m, cutting gearing from about 130 per cent to 45 per cent. Mr Chadwick, who holds 11.5 per cent of the equity, and fellow directors were not planning to sell any of their stake. He described September as a 'bumper' month for the group. In addition a big investor had taken up Pounds 2.75m worth of options, giving the group enough cash to continue its expansion. Brightreasons, owner of the Pizzaland restaurants chain, might delay its flotation plans, which remain 'subject to market conditions'. Mr Michael Guthrie, founder and chairman, said yesterday that the board had still made no final decision. The group said last month it would float at the end of October when it announced its annual results. The board meets in two weeks' time. Accounting snags over the complex treatment of Chilean investors and interests have delayed the Pounds 50m flotation of Seaperfect, the scallop and clam farmer. The company plans to raise Pounds 20m through an institutional placing.</p>

Prime minister of the coalition government and Democratic  Party leader Atun, speaking after a meeting with Gustave  Feissel, the United Nations deputy special envoy to Cyprus, said  Feissel conveyed the UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's  recent offers on the issue.    Atun said Greek Cypriots had a negative approach to the  confidence building measures, adding that their negative  approach affected the process of talks.    Feissel said their aim was to provide a peaceful and lasting  solution to the Cyprus problem.    Meanwhile TRNC foreign minister who is also acting as  defense  minister Atay Ahmet Rasit criticized the coming of Greek  commandos to the island saying Greek Cypriots' military  initiations hampered confidence measures.</p>

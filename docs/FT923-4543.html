			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Edinburgh Festival: A calm debut - reviews the off-stage action / Off The Wall BRIAN McMASTER is that rare bird in the roll call of directors of the Edinburgh Festival - quiet and self-effacing. His calmness was invaluable in putting together this, his first Festival, with only six months' planning; it has probably helped to ensure that the festival, which closes today, has gone so peacefully. It should even reach its box-office revenue target. The critics have already delivered their verdict on McMaster's four-prong programme. The Tchaikovsky glut of 30 pieces is reckoned a success, with some wonderful solo recitals; the crash course in Scottish music is regarded as a necessary sop to the locals; and, of the two playwrights put under the microscope, Harley Granville Barker was deemed interesting and worthy of more revivals, while CP Taylor will never enjoy such coverage again. The dance programme was good. The rain hit the box-office, but about 65 per cent of tickets were sold and theatre takings are up on last year - satisfaction for McMaster, a music man, over his predecessor, Frank Dunlop, a theatre man. Unfortunately, the Festival has invested in a national tour of Barker's 'The Voysey Inheritance,' which has failed to excite the citizens of Woking. Losses here could destroy McMaster's hope of reducing his inherited deficit of Pounds 179,000 in his first Festival. McMaster is entering what should be an encouraging future for the Edinburgh Festival. The new Royal Lyceum Theatre was open this year and proved a splendid asset; in 1994 Edinburgh at last gets its opera house, with the old Empire becoming the new Festival Theatre. Sponsors, and local authorities, and the Scottish Arts Council seem happy to contribute over 50 per cent of the Pounds 4.5m revenue needed to hold the Festival. There have been disappointments. Cristina Hoyos was not very popular, and the Taylor plays suffered from opening cold. Next year should be better, with opera making a come-back, probably Janacek and Verdi involving Scottish Opera. Other lessons digested include organising more events on the busy Bank Holiday Sunday; greater efforts to attract overseas visitors above the current 15 per cent of customers; and another go at an all-embracing marketing umbrella involving the Fringe, the film and the TV festivals. It remains a reproach that about a third of the seats were not filled. The 1992 Edinburgh Festival will not live forever in the memory, but it was enjoyable enough at any level, and a great achievement, given the recession. * * * Among the sights of Edinburgh this week was David Mellor, the Heritage Minister, coming out of summer hibernation to score easy boundaries off an audience of arts worthies assembled at the city's new pride and joy, the hi-tec Traverse Theatre. Mellor can say 'no' - he has decided against saving intact the 15th-century timber-framed house, Pitchford Hall in Shropshire and its contents, because he recalls the disaster of government ownership of Hevingham Hall - but he said 'yes' or 'maybe' to most of the demands of the lobbyists. Slowly his policies are taking shape. There are surprises. The Lotteries Bill will be presented to parliament this year and Mellor will fight any debilitating changes. By 1994 he expects lottery money to be boosting the arts. It seems that the existing institutions - the Arts Council, the Sports Council, the Museum and Galleries Commission - will allocate the funds rather than some new Lotteries organisation. And Lottery money will go towards revenue funding of the arts as well as big capital projects such as the proposed dance theatre for London. After two years of subsidy increases way ahead of inflation the arts must expect a more modest improvement in grant from this year's battle with the Treasury. But Mellor should gain more than the proposed 3 per cent. The government still believes in the arts, and, compared with the other candidates for cash, a few extra millions here makes a big splash. As for Covent Garden: in spite of press reports of icy glances Mellor and Jeremy Isaacs, the Royal Opera House's director, enjoyed dinner together at last month's Bayreuth Festival. Mellor, with memories of enduring a poor performance by Domingo in a Pounds 180 seat, still wants Covent Garden to become more accessible, but he is prepared to tackle the issue rather than pursue a personal vendetta against Isaacs. * * * The best farce at Edinburgh this year has been over the various awards, which now come fast and furious. Such gongs are useful in helping visitors choose between well over 1,000 shows on offer, but a comprehensive rationalisation is needed. A Japanese entrepreneur, a Mr Hamada, has attempted to buy himself artistic fame, both by presenting his own plays at Edinburgh and by throwing money at the Festival. As well as donations to both Festival and Fringe, this year he is offering two prizes, each of Pounds 25,000, for what are judged the best drama and musical events. This pitches companies such as the National Theatre against the Mark Morris Dance Group, for the drama award, and Schoenberg's Moses and Aaron against the solo recital by the Russian mezzo, Olga Borodina. All the big splashy events have received nominations - but representation by the Fringe is limited. Those that have might get much more; those that need seem frozen out. The most celebrated Fringe award, the Perrier, also needs overhauling. The money, Pounds 2,000, is too little, although the fame greatly increases the earning power of the winner - this year comedians Steve Coogan, working with John Thomson. The Perrier has dug itself into a hole by concentrating on cabaret and revue; its nominations are weighted towards the almost-famous, playing the big Fringe venues. It should try and hunt out rawer talent, or be all-embracing and give the money to the best act on the Fringe - even if it does not need a career boost. Cellnet's attempt to make prizes more democratic by sponsoring an award based on the phoned-in votes of the public proved brave but doomed. It fell victim to lobbying, and in the end the judges overruled the people and chose the Cauld Blast Orchestra as the winner.</p>

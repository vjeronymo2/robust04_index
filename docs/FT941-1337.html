			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Slough Estates advances 14% Slough Estates, the UK's largest industrial property company, yesterday announced a 14.2 per cent increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 46.4m to Pounds 53m for 1993 and a rise in net assets per share from 265p to 269p. The group posted a valuation surplus on its investment property portfolio of Pounds 115.6m or 7.6 per cent. A 13.1 per cent surplus on its UK properties was offset by a 6.8 per cent deficit overseas. 'For Slough, the immediate mood is cautious optimism,' said Sir Nigel Mobbs, chairman. 'The outlook for 1994 is much improved as a result of stronger business confidence and the prospect of sustainable economic recovery.' Rental values were likely to start their recovery later in the year for good properties in prime locations, he added. The company said it was increasing its development programme, particularly on the Slough trading estates. Its current construction programme amounts to 139,000 sq ft in the UK and Canada. By the year end, it expects to have another 285,000 sq ft of new industrial and retail warehouse space in the UK under construction. Slough said it would place emphasis on development of its existing portfolio rather than acquisitions. Sir Nigel criticised the 'extravagant' prices currently being asked by vendors. Provisions against the carrying value of trading stock fell from Pounds 18.8m to Pounds 7.3m. Operating profit of utilities fell to Pounds 2.8m (Pounds 4.1m), as a result of continuing commissioning problems. Last March's rights issue raised Pounds 147m, which pushed year-end gearing down to 56 per cent (83 per cent). Cash balances stood at Pounds 69m. Earnings per share was 7p, compared with a restated figure of 7.9p for 1992. An final dividend of 5p per share was recommended, which together with the 3.1p interim, represents an unchanged 8.1p on increased share capital. COMMENT The value placed on Slough Estates' assets was above most analysts' expectations, giving a small fillip to the share price, which rose 2p to 255p. But enthusiasm was tempered by the lacklustre rise in earnings, which left its dividend barely covered. Analysts were also critical of the further provisions against trading stock, the high level of interest capitalised and the continued weakness of Slough's utilities business. Nor has the management been forgiven for past errors of strategy and timing. Nonetheless, a strong performance from the company's core portfolio encourages confidence in the quality of its assets and the decision to invest money in developing its own portfolio makes clear sense. Estimates for this year's pre-tax profits range around Pounds 65m; the continuing mediocre prospects for future revenue growth and the weak dividend cover are likely to restrict the scope for any dividend increase. But the shares look reasonably valued on the assumption that the net asset value increases to Pounds 3 per share this year, putting them on a discount to net assets of 15 per cent.</p>

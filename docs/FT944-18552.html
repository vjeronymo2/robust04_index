			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / The Markets: Rubber pact flexibility needed - Commodities Rubber producers will be looking for concessions from consumers as the latest round of talks on a new Inter-national Natural Rubber Agreement get under way in Geneva today. Representatives of Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia, which produce more than 80 per cent of the world's rubber, told the Reuters news agency last week that consumers would need to make compromises to ensure a new pact was successfully concluded in the interests of both sides. The world's three top producers said that they were cautiously optimistic that the two-week meeting, under the aegis of the UN Conference on Trade and Development, would be successful. European rubber consuming countries said meanwhile that they supported plans for a new pact but warned that they had limited room for compromise. 'Everybody wants to finish,' a consumer delegate told Reuters, '. . . the issues are very simple. But we won't make any concessions that bear in them the chance that this pact might fail later.' Inra aims to stabilise rubber prices through the operation of a buffer stock buying and selling system. Following a recent surge to 6 1/2 -year highs on increased Chinese demand, cuts in Thai and Malaysian supplies and speculative buying, producers are calling for the reference price, which controls the levels at which the buffer stock manager can buy or sell, to be raised by 5 to 12 per cent from the 196.84 Malaysian/Singapore cents a kilogram level it was fixed at in February 1993. But consumers say the rise, if any, should be no more than 4 per cent. '(Support) Prices have to move with the long-term trend,' one said. A commodity trade expert commented: 'Delegates are always influenced by the recent prices, but they should really be looking to the period 1996 onwards for five or seven years . . . That is the relevant period they are trying to stabilise and they will have to justify their results at home.'</p>

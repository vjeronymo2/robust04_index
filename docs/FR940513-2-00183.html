			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Allegheny states that it anticipates that AYP will have no paid employees and that personnel employed by Allegheny Power Service Corporation (``Allegheny Service''), a wholly-owned nonutility subsidiary company of Allegheny, will provide a wide range of services, on an as-needed basis, to AYP pursuant to a service agreement to be entered into between AYP and Allegheny Service. Under this service agreement, AYP will reimburse Allegheny Service for the cost of services provided in accordance with Rules 90 and 91 of the Act. All time spent by Allegheny Service employees on AYP matters will be billed to and paid by AYP on a monthly basis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Allegheny states that AYP will maintain separate financial records with profit and loss statements. Allegheny Service, it is stated, pursuant to the service agreement with AYP, will be responsible for the financial records and for audit procedures that are in compliance with generally accepted principles. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to EWGs, Allegheny states that if AYP acquires an interest in an EWG, it will use Allegheny Service employees or other Allegheny system employees ``within a de minimis limit'' for services. It is stated that AYP will not use in excess of 2% of the total employees of all other Allegheny system domestic public utility companies for services to an affiliated EWG. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to new technologies related to its core business, Allegheny states that there are significant opportunities for investment in companies engaged in the development of new technologies that would promote the public interest through efficient and clean electric power generation and utilization. It is stated that the new technologies would be related to: (i) Electric power conversion and storage; (ii) conservation, load management, and demand side management; (iii) environmental and waste treatment; (iv) advanced computer hardware and software; (v) power-related electronic systems, control systems and components; (vi) electronic automation systems and components. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Allegheny states that, to invest in EWGs or in companies engaged in new technologies, AYP might directly invest or seek experienced investment partners and structure investment vehicles with those partners. In either event, each investment, it is stated, will be structured to limit the exposure of AYP to excessive liabilities and to allow AYP a role in the direction of the business. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Allegheny states that it now has no proposed specific investment in mind and that AYP shall make no investment without prior Commission approval. Allegheny also states that neither it nor AYP will, without Commission approval, finance the future acquisition by AYP of an EWG or new technologies company. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Margaret H.

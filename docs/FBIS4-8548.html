			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Bernadeta Waszkielewicz, Piotr Adamowicz, and </F> JBL: "Trade Unions After Meeting With Prime Minister; Pawlak: We  Can Live Without Popiwek"]    [Text] "Talks with employers and trade unions suggest that  it is possible to maintain the stable situation in the economy  without a law on wage controls," said Waldemar Pawlak after  yesterday's meeting with 18 trade unions, the Confederation of  Polish Employers, and the National Chamber of Commerce. He  explained that, as a result of changes in the style of managing  enterprises, "the popiwek [tax on excessive wage increases] will  be unnecessary." He will submit the conclusions from these  talks to the Council of Ministers. "There is a certain risk, but  I believe that we are prepared to take this risk because we can  count on responsible cooperation on the part of trade unions and  managers."    As the prime minister wants it, the government will probably  decide not to submit a new popiwek bill to the Sejm. Even  though Pawlak did not tell journalists directly that he would  not forward the new popiwek bill for the time being, Ewa  Spychalska, chairperson of the All-Polish Trade Unions Agreement  [OPZZ], stated that he had admitted that would retreat from this  idea. He will not forward this bill to the Sejm for a month,  unless some violent wage increases are observed during that time.    According to Pawlak, the road to maintaining a stable  economy  without controlling wages is "accelerating the work on laws  concerning collective agreements (wages would be negotiated in  them), legal regulations concerning the status of the Trilateral  Committee for Socioeconomic Affairs, including the issue of the  representativeness of trade unions, and accelerating the  commercialization of companies manufacturing goods for the  Polish market." "In the first order, we should commercialize  enterprises that are in good financial shape. We will try to  implement these processes as fast as possible, so that, in  companies that are in a position to increase wages, the founding  organs will be able to control these processes efficiently,"  said the prime minister.    He also stressed that it is important to "maintain the  special character of a public company, mainly in the area of  services, such as the railroads or post offices." "I am  counting on a responsible attitude of trade unions and managers.  For the time being, there is no danger of an uncontrolled wage  increase. If we take advantage of a frank and open exchange of  views, we will be able to go further and introduce solutions  that are effective and proven in countries characterized by  well-organized cooperation of social partners. The Council of  Ministers will discuss the conclusion of our meeting--that one  can live without a popiwek as well."    Zbigniew Siemiatkowski, press spokesman of the Democratic  Left Alliance [SLD], stated that, before the consultations in  the SLD leadership, he could not comment on the statement by  Prime Minister Pawlak. Most of the trade unions were nicely  surprised by the prime minister's decision to retreat from the  new proposal on wage controls.  <H5>  OPZZ: A Meeting a Month </H5>   Leaving the Office of the Council of Ministers, Spychalska  reported that, on 15 April, a meeting would be held on the  governmental program of socioeconomic policy for 1994-97. On 14  April, there will be a meeting on the final version of the Labor  Code. On 27 April, the government will submit the main points  of the reform of social insurance. According to the OPZZ  chairperson, the prime minister also assured the trade unions  that the labor minister had given up the changes in family  allowances--"their size will depend on a given family's income,  not on the number of children." "In the middle of each month,  consultation meetings, similar to the one held on 13 April, will  be held with representatives of trade unions and employers,"  said the OPZZ head.  <H5>  Solidarity ["S"]: Prime Minister Speaks About Our Proposal </H5>   "I will not beat around the bush and say bluntly that the  government has not implemented most of the "S" demands; however,  we are satisfied with the prime minister's announcement of  departing from the new popiwek law, which is in line with the  opinions of experts," Marian Krzaklewski commented on the  government's stand on the "S" demands. "We have always thought  that wage regulation should be conducted through a system of  collective agreements; now, because there exist enterprises of a  monopolistic character, which may raise wages by setting higher  prices, there should be some kind of control system. It seems  that the government will agree to our proposal that, in those  enterprises, wages not only be regulated in collective  agreements but also be confirmed in the Trilateral Committee. A  list of such enterprises should be drawn up by the Antimonopoly  Office," stated Piotr Zak, press spokesman of the "S" National  Commission [KK].    The KK hoped to receive a reply from the Council of  Ministers before the session--the council discussed the "S"  demands on Tuesday [12 April]. It did not receive a letter from  the prime minister, and it learned about the government's stance  from a reporter. Asked after the meeting with trade unions  about the "S" demands, the prime minister dodged the question,  drawing attention to the fact that it was a meeting with many  unions and employers and that the conclusion was different.  Stanislaw Alot, KK secretary delegated to yesterday's meeting  with the prime minister, stated that the government had actually  answered only two demands: that it will depart from the popiwek,  and that it will review earlier agreements with "S" over the  next two weeks. It opened itself, to a certain extent, to other  demands--among other things, the government intends to implement  a law on collective agreements, representativeness, and the  Trilateral Committee within a month. Alot also wanted an answer  to the other demands, but he did not receive it, or, as he says,  the answer was unsatisfactory.  <H5>  The Strikes Are Dying Down </H5>   The "S" head announced that the strikes would be continued.  "It is not a matter of fighting during the next days or weeks  but months. In the fall, price increases will be the most  numerous, which will cause an outbreak of strikes," stated  Krzaklewski. Earlier statements by "S" leaders suggested that,  if the talks with the government failed, one should expect, if  not an escalation of protests, at least their continuation.  During their session, most KK members were unanimous in saying  that the entire action and the talks with the government held so  far were not a spectacular success. "The strikes made it  possible to regulate the legal status of the Trilateral  Committee for Socioeconomic Affairs and the issue of the  representativeness of unions," said Maciej Jankowski. The  Mazowsze leader, who is said to be the greatest radical,  admitted that strikes were dying down and that "today there is  not a good atmosphere for strikes." Similar views were  expressed by other KK members. "The union has regained a good  position in society. The protest should be continued; we should  fight for public support. We should keep pointing to the  discrepancies between preelection declarations and the  activities of the government coalition. In the fall, price  increases will be most numerous; this is when a wave of strikes  will surge. Let us use this time to collect strike funds,"  appealed Jacek Rybicki, of Gdansk. According to "S" Spokesman  Piotr Zak, it was finally decided that the protest action would  not be discontinued; but, at the same time, no serious strikes  should be expected. He announced street demonstrations and "a  major propaganda campaign." The fundamental goal is still  collecting money for the strike fund.    Most of the "S" decisionmakers believe that a meeting with  President Lech Walesa is necessary--skeptics believe that only  after Walesa defines his intentions, others that cooperation is  needed because both Walesa and the union would like the present  postcommunist government to step down. There was not much  enthusiasm over the recent proposal by Zbigniew Religa; he  proposed that the Non-Party Bloc in Support of Reforms [BBWR]  become a political representative of "S" in the Sejm. "Many  BBWR activists are antiunion," some said. The KK decided that  the Sixth National Congress of "S" delegates would be held  between 30 June and 2 July in Mielec.</p>

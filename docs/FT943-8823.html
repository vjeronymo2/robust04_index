			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / International Company News: Craftsmen are put in the saddle at Taiwan's Dahon - The world's biggest maker of foldable bicycles is aiming to improve quality in its top-of-the-range models Dahon, the world's biggest maker of foldable bicycles, is hoping to take a leaf out of early manufacturers' books and introduce old-fashioned pride and craftsmanship to at least some of its production. The Taiwanese company recently opened a new facility whose production methods are modelled on those of its Dutch subsidiary. In Taiwan, Dahon bikes have until now been made on an assembly line, and for a while at least, most will continue to be. However, Dahon is setting up a smaller, parallel workshop for top-of-the-range models where one worker will be responsible for building an entire bicycle. 'Compared with an optimised assembly line as developed by Henry Ford, it's obviously not as efficient to have one person build an entire bike,' says Mr Josh Hon, son of the company's founder, Mr David Hon. 'But the advantage is that the quality is better, because each worker takes personal pride in the bike. The workmanship is much more meticulous.' Each bicycle made in the Dutch factory is sold with a sticker bearing the name of the worker who assembled it. The Netherlands facility was set up in early 1992 to improve service and increase European sales. Perhaps surprisingly, labour costs in Europe are not significantly higher than in Taiwan, Mr Hon says. Also, when one factors in Taiwan's high employee turnover and the costs of recruiting and training new workers, and the resulting impact on productivity and quality, one comes out even, he says. In a little more than a decade, Dahon has grown to a company with annual revenues in excess of Dollars 10m and annual unit sales of between 90,000 and 100,000, accounting for more than half of the international market for folding bicycles. The story of Dahon is in many ways an archetypal tale of the Chinese diaspora. The elder Mr Hon was born in Canton, grew up in Hong Kong and attended university and graduate school in the US. During the energy crisis in the mid-1970s, Mr Hon began tinkering with a prototype folding bicycle in his garage while pursuing a career as a laser physicist at Hughes Aircraft in Los Angeles. The original idea was to create a bicycle which could be used by commuters in cities such as Los Angeles where *something in here (HP) * public transport is not particularly convenient. A commuter could cycle to the nearest bus or train station, fold the machine and carry it, then ride it to the office. In 1983, Mr Hon quit Hughes Aircraft to launch his own company. He chose Taiwan for its plentiful supply of skilled labour and flexibility in sourcing components. Dahon's corporate history has been chequered with challenges. These range from the sharp appreciation of the Taiwan dollar in the late 1980s and a subsequent jump in land and labour costs, to difficulties in training and retaining skilled workers. Until recently, Dahon dominated the market, but now it is struggling to fend off a spate of competitors - some of whom are former employees who undercut Dahon's market with cheaper copies. The new Dutch-style production facility is just another bid to stay one step ahead of the competition. Another way has been to invest in the research and development of new models, including a selection of folding mountain bikes as well as city bicycles. In addition to assembling bikes in the markets in which they will be sold - thus avoiding import tariffs - Dahon is also beginning to source components offshore in places such as China, although the engineering and quality does not yet match Taiwan standards. Mr Hon fears that given the higher retail cost of a Dahon bicycle - the price is between 50 per cent and 100 per cent higher than a comparable non-folding model - the market may be approaching saturation. Without the capital to increase volume and thus achieve economies of scale, the production costs will remain high. Dahon has been talking with potential partners for several years, but no pact has been reached to date. 'Our dream is to get costs down to the point where the retail price is just 20 or 25 per cent higher than that of ordinary bikes,' explains Mr Hon. 'If we can do that, we believe our market would expand dramatically. If you could buy a bike which was just as good as a normal bike, but had the advantage of being foldable, you'd probably be willing to pay a bit more.' The single biggest obstacle to reducing costs is the stranglehold on the world market in derailleur gear systems held by one Japanese company, Shimano. For Taiwanese bike-makers, the derailleur alone accounts for about half of the production cost of a bicycle, Mr Hon estimates. Dahon's best market has historically been Japan, but the rest of Asia, especially Hong Kong, South Korea and Taiwan, is growing quickly. The younger Mr Hon believes this is due to the fact that there is such a premium on space in crowded Asian countries. The US market is unlikely to see much growth, he says, but Europe has much potential.</p>

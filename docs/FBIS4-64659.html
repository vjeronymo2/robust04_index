			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn -- During their visits to Bonn on Wednesday [4  May], Lithuanian Prime Minister Adolfas Slezavicius and Slovak  Republic Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan asked for German support  with their plans to join European institutions. The Foreign  Ministry reported that separate talks that Foreign Minister  Klaus Kinkel had with the two politicians centered around  questions of the future situation in Europe and Euro-Atlantic  security structures.    Kinkel assured Slezavicius that it was in Germany's interest  to move Lithuania close to the European Union [EU], the Western  European Union, and NATO as quickly as possible. Expanding  relations between the three Baltic states and the European Union  will be an important item on the agenda of Germany's EU  presidency that starts on 1 July.    The Lithuanian prime minister also met with Minister  Friedrich Bohl in the Chancellor's Office and had talks with  Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt. The Economics Ministry  reports that trade figures between the FRG and Lithuania show a  favorable balance. At 17 percent, the FRG is Lithuania's most  important foreign trade partner. As many as 500 joint ventures  have been formed so far.    According to the Foreign Ministry, the Slovak foreign  minister started a three-day visit to Germany on Wednesday.  Before taking off for Germany, Kukan said that he also wants to  appeal to German companies to get more involved in Slovakia.</p>

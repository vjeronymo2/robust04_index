			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOOD &amp; WINE: TAMING WILD MUSHROOMS WESTERN SUPPLIERS ARE DOMESTICATING  EXOTIC VARIETIES FOR A GROWING MARKET  </P> <P> BRINGING HOME mushrooms used to mean getting up in the dark and tramping for  miles through damp, quiet woods looking for the one perfect green grove where  they grew. Their earthy smells and flavors, rich, dark and slightly musty, were  known only by the privileged few who could find them.  </P> <P> Nowadays, though, mycophiles need only visit the grocery store. Exotic  mushrooms, once found only in the wild, are now grown commercially and are as  common as fresh herbs and baby vegetables.  </P> <P> Two years ago, the only mushroom available in Ralphs stores was the  white-button variety (known as Agaricus campestris). This year, the chain  expects to sell 7,000 to 10,000 pounds of fresh shiitake mushrooms. Ralphs also  stocks oyster, enoki, crimini and hon shimeji mushrooms and chanterelles.  </P> <P> Except for the chanterelles, no longer are these mushrooms wild but rather wild  varieties now cultivated commercially. Growing them is a complicated procedure  that depends on temperature, moisture, soil type, habitat and spore management.  The right combination of factors is so elusive that, after centuries of trying,  the most prized wild mushroom, boletus edulis (called cepes in France and  porcini in Italian), has not been successfully grown.  </P> <P> Most cultivated mushrooms come from one supplier, Russ Hauptmann of  Watsonville's Monterey Mushrooms. The country's largest grower of mushrooms,  Monterey concentrates on Agaricus -- the familiar button type -- but two years  ago began distributing oyster, shiitake and enoki varieties from commercial  growers.  </P> <P> Jim Hammond, of Hazel Dell, is one of Hauptmann's suppliers. He farms enoki,  oyster and shiitake mushrooms in two Watsonville warehouses. The mushrooms are  cultivated in plastic bags filled with sawdust or straw mixed with rice or  wheat bran. The bags are inoculated with the fungus mycellium -- a feathery  kind of mushroom "root" -- then left to colonize for 5 to 15 weeks. Once the  crop begins to grow, the plastic is removed to let the mushrooms mature.  </P> <P> Truly wild mushrooms come from operators such as Matt Briggs of Cascade  Mushrooms in Portland, Ore. Briggs contracts with pickers all over the country  who scour their local woods for fungi. Briggs buys and sells chanterelles,  morels, boletes, American truffles and black trumpets, as well as more exotic  mushrooms such as cauliflower, hedgehog, bear's head, lobster, coral and  blewits.  </P> <P> Commercially available mushrooms receive mixed reviews from chefs. Mark Peel of  Campanile likes oyster mushrooms. He sautes them over very high heat and serves  them over salmon with summer vegetables. Peel cautions not to serve oyster  mushrooms raw because they're "bitter and tannic."  </P> <P> Patina's Joachim Splichal roasts oyster mushrooms with garlic and butter to  use, with roasted potatoes, as a garnish for chicken salad. One of his favorite  cultivated mushrooms is the regular white Agaricus, which he roasts with garlic  and parsley, purees and pipes into mini-turnips. But he is downright vehement  about enoki mushrooms: "They have nothing to do with flavor; they're just  window dressing." He also thinks shiitakes are overpriced.  </P> <P> On the other hand, Leonard Schwartz of 72 Market Street and the new Maple Drive  considers the shiitake the "best all-purpose mushroom in the world. It delivers  the most flavor for the money spent." He uses shiitakes in this wintry salad of  scallops with apples and almonds. "Scallops," he says, "have an inherent  sweetness that complements the woodsy, smoky quality of the shiitakes."  </P> <P> WARM SCALLOP SALAD WITH APPLES, ALMONDS AND SHIITAKE MUSHROOMS  </P> <P> 2 ounces Vinaigrette (see below)  </P> <P> 3 cups mixed lettuces  </P> <P>  1/2 teaspoon minced chives  </P> <P> 6 ounces bay scallops or sea scallops  </P> <P> 2/3 cup shiitake mushrooms, thinly sliced  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons apple, thinly sliced  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon toasted sliced almonds  </P> <P> 8 snow peas  </P> <P> Make vinaigrette.  </P> <P> Heat saute pan very hot.  </P> <P> Mix lettuces with ounce of vinaigrette and pinch of chives. Place in center of  plate.  </P> <P> Saute scallops and mushrooms half-minute and place in small bowl. Add apples,  almonds, another pinch of chives and snow peas to bowl, toss with remainder of  vinaigrette and place on top of greens.  </P> <P> Makes 2 servings.  </P> <P> Vinaigrette  </P> <P> 1 ounce light olive oil  </P> <P> 1 ounce peanut oil  </P> <P>  1/2 ounce lemon juice  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon soy sauce  </P> <P> Mix together in large bowl and whisk well before use.  </P> <P> Food stylist: Sandra Cook  </P></p>

			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Monarch seeks Pounds 19m to develop Venezuelan gold mine and mill MONARCH RESOURCES, the London-quoted exploration and mining company, is to raise Pounds 19m net by way of a fully underwritten rights issue of convertible loan stock, mainly to develop a gold mine and mill at its La Camorra concession in Venezuela. Mr Michael Beckett, chairman, said the average cash cost of producing gold at La Camorra would be about Dollars 115 a troy ounce, making it one of the world's lowest-cost gold mines. He said exploration in the area would also be stepped up. Monarch will spend Dollars 3m (Pounds 1.6m) this year, up from Dollars 800,000 in 1991 and now has ten geologists on its staff, against three last year. Monarch also announced yesterday that in 1991 it reduced pre-tax losses from Dollars 6.3m to Dollars 2.94m. The net loss was down from Dollars 41.8m, or Dollars 0.455 a share, to Dollars 2.94m, or Dollars 0.206 a share. The non-interest bearing convertible unsecured loan stock will be issued at up to 68p per unit on the basis of two units for each ordinary share. Payment will be in two instalments, the first at 48p. Monarch's shares closed unchanged at 80p. Mr Beckett said that a new feasibility study on La Camorra by independent consultants showed that for an estimated net capital outlay of Dollars 22.95m, at an assumed gold price of Dollars 350 a troy ounce, there was an indicated rate of return of 41.8 per cent. Monarch would get its capital outlay back in 1.25 years from the start of production - projected to be in 1994. The mine would have a life of 4.35 years, with an annual output of 86,000 ounces of gold over the first four years. Monarch's biggest shareholder, Mr August von Finck, a German businessman, has irrevocably agreed to take up his rights and to retain the stock until payment or cancellation of the second instalment in July next year. Mr von Fink intends to maintain his shareholding at 23.8 per cent, although, if no other shareholders took up the issue it might temporarily rise to 44.8 per cent. The balance of the issue has been underwritten by Leopold Joseph and Sons. Mr Carl von Rohrer, a Munich-based fund manager, is sub-underwriting the issue and Monarch will also issue 90,000 shares as a sub-underwriting fee. Under these arrangements Mr von Rohrer and/or funds under his management will potentially own up to 29.9 per cent of the increased capital. Mr von Rohrer and Mr von Finck have confirmed that they are not acting in concert with each other or any other Monarch shareholder. They have undertaken that, apart from the rights issue, neither will increase his interest above 29.9 per cent without making a general offer.</p>

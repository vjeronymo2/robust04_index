			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 26 TASS -- KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA on  Chernobyl disaster anniversary.    The newspaper carries a map of the European part of the  former Soviet Union showing areas of radiological contamination  after the breakdown at the Chernobyl nuclear power station.    "Radiation affected 70 percent of Belarusian territory. Two  million and three hundred thousand Belarusians, among them half  a million children, are the direct victims of the Chernobyl  disaster. These figure are comparable only with the number of  victims of Nazi genocide: every fourth out of ten million  Belarusians was killed."    The newspaper also reports the lack of funds for the  elimination of the aftermath of the disaster, a shortage of  hospital accommodation, and scarcity of medicines in clinics.    PRAVDA on the same subject:    "In 1986 the misfortune united people, nations and  countries.  Now we live wide apart. Chernobyl-affected people regret the  break-up of the Soviet Union. They see how the programme for  the elimination of the aftermath of the disaster has virtually  disintegrated. Meanwhile, the Chernobyl disaster aftermath  continues to impair people's health and claim their lives. In  1993 alone, 7,000 more Chernobyl troubleshooters became  incapacitated."    KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) on Cherbobyl disaster aftermath:    "Out of 300,000 people in Russia who were affected by the  Chernobyl disaster, 30,000 became invalids, more than 5,000  died, and death rate among them grows with every passing year.  More than 30,000 of them have no housing accomodation or are in  need of improved housing".    The newspaper gives opinions of experts who believe that  there are no guarantees against other nuclear breakdowns so far.    "One may ask how many people would be ready to display  heroism and self-sacrifice shown by the Chernobyl  troubleshooters, if the country, in the name of which they  sacrificed themselves, has sought to forget about them and their  needs?"    ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI quotes Professor Viktor Mikhailov, Russian  Federation minister for nuclear power, as saying that  "technically, a breakdonw similar to the Chernobyl one is ruled  out. However, this does not mean that no incidents could happen  again".    TRUD carries an article dedicated to the memory of  academician Valeriy Legasov. In 1986, he was a member of the  governmental commission for inquiry into the Chernobyl disaster  and directly participated in putting out the fire there. In  1988 he committed suicide. The writer of the article makes an  attempt to unravel the mystery why Legasov took his own life.    TRUD interviewed federation council speaker Vladimir  Shumeyko  who made an evaluation of a draft treaty on civic accord in  Russia. He agreed with the document in principle.    "I have some observations to make on individual clauses of  the document. But I believe that if we set about refining it,  it will never be adopted. Therefore I regard as extremely  important and correct the proposal to set up a standing  constitutional commission. Such a commission is essential for  the entire duration of the treaty and moratorium on political  wars", Shumeyko said.    RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA runs an inteview with constitutional court  member Valeriy Zorkin. Asked about his attitude to the draft  treaty on civic accord, Zorkin said that "while sharing on the  whole the idea of the treaty and supporting it, I think its  initiators has seriously miscalculated, failing to arrange for a  countrywide discussion of the draft treaty, as is provided for  in an appropriate presidential instruction.    "The treaty will be really effective when it becomes  agreement of the people, not just of elites or individual  citizens even if they are worthy of respect".    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA reprints Boris Yeltsin's interview with  DER SPIEGEL magazine. Touching upon the question of Russia's  involvement in NATO's Partnership-for-Peace programme, the  Russian president said: "We are prepared to sign the partnership  agrement but at the same time we would like to sign with NATO an  additional protocol to settle a number of principled matters".    NEZAVISIAMAYA GAZETA runs a list of 50 most powerful and  influential figures of Russian business. The list includes the  names of the chiefs of major commercial organisations -- banks.  Exchanges, foundations, joint-stock companies, trading houses,  insurance companies, joint ventures, etc.    SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA runs a report delivered by Gennadiy  Zyuganov, chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the  Russian Communist Party, at an all-Russia party conference in  April.</p>

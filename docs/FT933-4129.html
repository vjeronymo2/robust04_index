			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / India's central bank warns on overspending THE RESERVE Bank of India, the central bank, yesterday warned the government in New Delhi that it is in danger of overshooting the borrowing targets set in its wide-ranging economic reform programme. In its 1992-93 annual report, published yesterday, the bank said government borrowing in July, the latest period for which figures are available, was running at Rs174bn (Pounds 3.6bn) - more than twice the level for the equivalent month in 1992 and more than three times the level at the end of the last financial year in March. The reserve bank's warning comes amid signs that the government is under political pressure to boost spending on subsidies and other handouts, in advance of crucial state elections to be held in November. Elections are due in four states where the local assemblies, dominated by the opposition right-wing Hindu Bharatiya Janata Party, were suspended after the sacking of the Ayodhya mosque by BJP supporters. The ruling Congress (I) Party is anxious to avert the danger of the BJP returning to power with increased majorities. The reserve bank report was generally optimistic about India's economic prospects citing good growth and low inflation. But it expressed 'concern' at the rise in government borrowing. Separately, in an interview, Mr C Rangarajan, the central bank governor, said: 'We have expressed serious concern to the government at the high level of net credit to the government  .we feel that it is now running at a level far above what we regard as a desirable level. He said that ministers had to cut spending or raise revenues. India is finding it difficult to cut government borrowing in line with targets agreed with the International Monetary Fund, which is monitoring its economy. In 1991-92, the first year of reform, the gross fiscal deficit dropped from 8.4 per cent to 6 per cent of GDP. But in the year to March 1993, the deficit fell only marginally to 5.7 per cent of GDP. For the current year it is running at a similar level, far above the target of 4.7 per cent. Indian officials could face questions about these developments at the annual meeting of the World Bank and IMF later this month in Washington. Finance ministry officials say the problem is caused partly by a fall in customs revenue due to the slowdown in imports and partly by more spending. Officials also argue that since India's inflation rate is low, delays in cutting the fiscal deficit are not critical.</p>

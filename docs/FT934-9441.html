			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Survey of Austria (7): When the curtain lifts - Immigration WHEN HUNGARY removed the first piece of the Iron Curtain, on its border with Austria, in mid-1989, it not only put in motion the fall of communism, but also Europe's largest migration wave since the second world war. Ever since, Austria has become a magnet for thousands of refugees and immigrants from eastern and south-eastern Europe. For them, it is is the first stop on the way to the wealthy west - as Italy, France and Spain are for people from Northern Africa. As in other European countries, immigration has come to dominate Austrian politics well beyond the scope of the problem. Some 6.6 per cent of the population, or about half a million people, have foreign passports, many of them guest workers who have lived in Austria for years. Austria has never had such liberal asylum laws as Germany, where the right to asylum was written into the constitution until last summer. Ever since the Austrian military began guarding the border with Hungary in 1990, officials have said that they have the immigration flows under control. Even so, the market for unskilled labour has been swelled in recent years by job-seekers from eastern Europe, mostly Slovaks, Poles and Rumanians. Pick-pocket gangs from across the border have made petty crime a serious problem in Vienna. Meanwhile, about 40,000 Bosnian refugees have poured into Austria, and no one expects them to return to their homes in the foreseeable future. Especially in the working-class districts of Vienna, the influx of foreigners has become a symbol of the perils of economic change. Feeding on fears of crime, unemployment and a growing housing shortage, the right-wing Freedom party (FPO) and its charismatic chairman Mr Jorg Haider have repeatedly played the xenophobic card. The FPO has boosted its share of votes to nearly 20 per cent in recent years, even though a controversial petition drive against immigration failed to garner significant support at the start of the year. But it has been the Social Democratic party (SPO) which has been the driving force behind curbs on immigration. Worried that its blue-collar voters will desert the party for Mr Haider, the SPO chairman and Chancellor, Mr Franz Vranitzky, has quietly engineered some of Europe's toughest immigration laws, which went into effect last July. Getting political asylum is now a gamble with very little chance of success, and receiving a legal work permit has become equally difficult. The most controversial aspects of the new bill concern long-term residents who are applying for an extension of their visas. Making a mistake or missing a deadline can result in immediate expulsion. A widely criticised clause of the new law states that foreigners must have at least 10 square metres of living space per person in order to have their residency permit extended. Given the tight housing situation in Vienna and wide-spread discrimination against non-Austrians, this clause would make more than 100,000 people illegal aliens. Like Germany, Austria does not grant automatic citizenship to long-term residents, or even to children born in the country. This traditional policy has hampered the integration of foreigners and weakens their ability to seek legal protection. Several well-publicised cases about foreigners trapped in the bureaucratic maze have caused an uproar over the new law in political and intellectual circles. Key members of the People's party (OVP), the junior coalition partner, have called for a quick revision to eliminate its most vicious elements. In the forefront of the fight is a broad-based coalition of artists, writers and church leaders, called 'SOS Neighbour', which was originally formed to oppose Mr Haider's petition drive. Their anger is now mostly directed against Mr Franz Loschnak, the interior minister and a key aide to Mr Vranitzky. Opposition has also been voiced by business and industry, which has come to depend on cheap foreign labour. As the number of work permits for foreigners is gradually reduced, many sectors are complaining about a worsening labour shortage. Sectors such as construction and tourism could not survive without guest workers, executives say. But Social Democrats have held firm on their tough immigration policies, and several figures show their calculation may be right. The number of asylum seekers had dropped to 3,187 in August, from 13,820 a year earlier, and surveys show broad support for the policy among average Austrians. Even Mr Loschnak has gained in popularity in recent months. The SPO may lose some young voters to the leftist Greens, who call for a liberalisation of immigration laws, but the party seems to have secured its core working-class constituency. Loschnak also argues that Austria still hosts more war refugees per capita than any other European country, and individual hardship cases are often settled leniently. Moreover, Austria has avoided the kind of right-wing violence against foreigners that has engulfed Germany over the past two years.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beirut, May 20 (XINHUA) -- U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher is going to pay another shuttle visit to the  Middle East region next month, Charge d'Affaires of the United  States to Lebanon Vincent Battle said today.    According to a report broadcast by Radio Lebanon, the U.S.  diplomat today met with Lebanese Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz  in his office and told him that Christopher would make  additional efforts to bridge differences between Syria and  Israel over the future of Golan Heights.    The foreign minister told local reporters that his meeting  with the U.S. charge d'affaires concentrated on the last round  of talks Christopher held with Syrian leaders in Damascus and  with Israeli officials in Tel Aviv.    He expected that another round of talks would be held (by  the  U.S. secretary of state) before the parties concerned are  invited to resume their negotiations.    He pointed out the talks between Syria, Israel and the  United  States, despite their seriousness, are still far away from  reaching an agreement among them.    "So it is necessary to make more endeavors and efforts in  order to achieve this purpose," the foreign minister said.</p>

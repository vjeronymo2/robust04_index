			<p><P> March 11, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 62 IN 6 YEARS AT JOHN WAYNE;  </P> <P> ACCIDENTS DO HAPPEN -- EVEN ON THE GROUND  </P> <P> As you rumble down the John Wayne Airport runway toward takeoff, the knot in  your stomach implores you to stay on the ground, where it's safe.  </P> <P> But there have been 62 accidents on the runways, taxiways and aircraft parking  areas at the airport since Jan. 1, 1983, Federal Aviation Administration  records show. They range from the Cessna that skidded to a stop on the runway  because its pilot retracted the landing gear instead of the flaps, to the DC-9  jetliner that struck a parked fuel truck.  </P> <P> Although there were 10 such incidents in 1988 -- four more than in 1987 --  that's still fewer than the 18 posted for 1984, according to FAA records. And  although numbers for other airports were not available, FAA and John Wayne  officials said they believe the airport has one of the lowest accident rates in  the United States.  </P> <P> "The numbers are pretty low, considering the large number of daily flight  operations we have here," said Kathie Rutherford, airport spokeswoman.  </P> <P> There were 533,531 takeoffs and landings at John Wayne Airport in 1988, 444,594  of which involved non-commercial aircraft, according to airport officials.  There is a daily average of 182 commercial jet departures or landings.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Safety Checks  </P> <P> Jan Mittermeier, assistant airport manager, said: "We maintain a presence out  on the field to check for safety problems, and when we know a new aircraft is  going to use this facility, there are all sorts of elaborate plans and drawings  that are submitted to the FAA showing how that plane is going to get from one  point to another, with wing clearances and a lot more."  </P> <P> An FAA spokesman in Washington said it is not unusual for some airports --  including Los Angeles International and Washington National -- to have dozens  of mishaps on the ground in a single year.  </P> <P> Because the criteria for classification as a ground accident include runway  delays and damage to buildings, some listed as ground accidents actually  occurred in the air, either just before or immediately after takeoff.  </P> <P> Such was the case at John Wayne, for example, on Sept. 27, 1983, when a  McDonnell Douglas DC-9 jetliner lost power after takeoff and showered flaming  engine debris on homes below, setting several roof fires. The FAA records show  that since 1983, four accidents resulted in deaths and four in injuries. Among  the cases shown in the records:  </P> <P> * September, 1983: A passenger died after walking into a propeller of a small  Cessna. "The pilot claims that the passenger was warned of the hazard before  deplaning."  </P> <P> * January, 1984: A pilot was injured when his plane flipped over in the wind  during landing.  </P> <P> * October, 1984: A pilot died in a fiery crash when the propeller of his small  Beechcraft came off during takeoff. "Latch spring not installed in proper hub."  </P> <P> * November, 1985: A Piper crashed in a Tustin field on approach to John Wayne,  injuring the pilot. "Fuel cell bladders not fastened, partially collapsed. This  reduced fuel capacity. Ran out of fuel, landed in field."  </P> <P> * December, 1985: A pilot was killed when his Piper "struck a tree, then a  house during landing, after the engine quit. Ran right main fuel tank dry, did  not switch tanks."  </P> <P> * February, 1986: A pilot died when his small Beechcraft missed the runway on a  fog-bound approach and crashed in an Irvine parking lot. "Pilot was not  instrument rated."  </P> <P> * April, 1987: "A baggage loader ran into the side of a parked Continental  Airlines DC-9. Driver's foot severed. Blamed bad brakes."  </P> <P> * August, 1988: A flight attendant on a BAe-146 jetliner was "injured trying to  reach seat during takeoff roll. Cabin crew did not hear announcement of  takeoff."  </P> <P> Some of the accidents involved jet blasts' lifting small planes off the ground,  blown tires and pilot errors. In one incident, for example, the pilot of a  small Piper "landed with gear up. Forgot to lower landing gear."  </P> <P> And there's this one, about a Cessna: "Collided with 2 parked aircraft.  Malfunction of anti-skid control. . . ."  </P> <P> And this about one Cessna overtaking another: "Overflew unauthorized Cessna on  the same runway. Pilot reported he did not hear tower instructions to abort."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Little Damage'  </P> <P> Cargo doors and cockpit windows have blown out on takeoffs, and planes have  come down hard, collapsing their landing gear. Many of the incidents involved  student pilots.  </P> <P> But Gary Lackey of Lenair Aviation Inc., a flight school at John Wayne, said  there is no cause for alarm.  </P> <P> "I would say that ground incidents occur often enough to be a headache, but  there's actually little damage ever done," he said. "Considering the level of  activity here and the strange mix of flight operations -- with busy airline  schedules and large numbers of general aviation aircraft -- we are doing very  well as an airport."  </P> <P> "It's much better now than it was a few years ago," Lackey said. "Now we don't  have so many problems with the small planes and the big jets getting too close  together.  </P> <P> "Many of the problems occur when the (control) tower has urged a private pilot  to hurry up and land in order to get out of the way of a big jet," Lackey said.  </P> <P> On Thursday night, American Airlines Flight 619 was forced to abort a landing  at John Wayne and accelerate steeply to avoid a small plane that had taxied  onto the runway in front of it.  </P> <P> As is often the case, the incident was not reported to the FAA. Barbara Abels,  an FAA spokeswoman, said such reports are made at the pilots' discretion.  </P> <P> Some owners of small aircraft are worried that the county, which owns the  airport, may try some day to limit the facility to commercial airlines, air  taxi services and business jets. So far, however, the number of ground  accidents has been too low to fuel more than speculation about banning small  privately owned planes.  </P></p>

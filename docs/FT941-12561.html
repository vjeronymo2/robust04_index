			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Commissioners' decision not 'political' Sir, Your leader on the stainless steel tubes case ('Openness on open markets', January 28) attributed Mr Van Miert's 'defeat' to 'political considerations'. At least three of the Commissioners who voted against action had no national or industry connections whatever. Moreover the whole industry is tiny in EU political terms. And why did DGIV 'lose' this case on the very day that it 'won' on state aid to two far more important and politically influential industries? The truth is more interesting: the independent Commissioners were not persuaded by the case that Mr Van Miert's officials had assembled against the merger. These officials had been asked to be first prosecutors and then judges. Almost the whole history of western law teaches us that these two functions ought not to be combined. Substantial evidence on international markets, east European competition and structural decline was brushed aside by enforcer-prosecutors who had prejudged the case. Moreover, the draft decision was inconsistent with important previous merger decisions. All this could be, and was, pointed out to the independent Commissioners. They know that in merger cases an appeal to the courts is too slow to be an effective check and therefore that they, the Commissioners, are the de facto court of appeal. They take this responsibility seriously. In the stainless steel tubes case they judged the officials' case against the merger and found it unconvincing. William Bishop, Lexecon, 33-34 Alfred Place, London WC1E 7DP</p>

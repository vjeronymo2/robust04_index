			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Sellafield unions gear up Thorp lobby UNION leaders at Sellafield are writing to the nuclear plant's 700 Cumbria-based suppliers this week to enlist their support for a campaign backing the commission of the Pounds 2.8bn Thorp reprocessing installation. Shop stewards are urging suppliers to write to the Pollution Inspectorate emphasising the economic importance of Thorp - Thermal Oxide Reprocessing Plant - and have included a draft letter for guidance. They are stepping up their lobbying during a two-week extension, announced last Thursday, to the public consultation process on proposed new discharge authorisations. The union leaders, who also plan to double the 18,000 signatures on their pro-Thorp petition, are competing against environmental groups' efforts. The inspectorate has received 15,000 communications, 9,500 of them opposing Thorp, since consultation began in mid-November. Prior to that, it received 38,000, mostly anti-Thorp. In 1991-92, British Nuclear Fuels spent Pounds 604m, mainly for its Sellafield site, with 1,090 British companies. Goods supplied ranged from vending machine fairy cakes to stainless steel vessels. The controversy over Thorp's commissioning has alarmed BNFL suppliers nationally; a number have written to the company and MPs expressing their concern. The Sellafield unions fear the entire site's future may be jeopardised, with grave economic consequences for west Cumbria, if Thorp is not commissioned. 'Take one part away and the other falls,' said Mr John Kane, shop stewards committee secretary. Without Sellafield, he estimated, male unemployment locally would exceed 40 per cent. The site employs 12,400 on BNFL's and contractors' payrolls. Suppliers planning to write to HMIP include Romar, the Cleator Moor-based industrial workwear manufacturer. Two thirds of the company's Pounds 300,000 annual turnover is with Sellafield. 'Sellafield is the insurance policy for West Cumbria', said Romar's founder Mr John Rowlands. Loss of Thorp would mean a 30 per cent drop in his business, the loss of three of his 10 employees and cancellation of expansion plans, he said.</p>

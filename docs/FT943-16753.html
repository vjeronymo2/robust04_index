			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt turns its attention to banks The fact that long bonds were thought likely to recover in the third quarter of 1994, was no help to markets - Paris, and Madrid in particular - where they continued to fall on the day, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT opened the third quarter with a nod in the direction of the strategists who have been saying that banks deserve a spell in the sun again, after a long time out in the cold. Deutsche Bank, Dresdner and Commerzbank, Germany's big three, managed to rise in tandem: by DM10 to DM694, DM4.30 to DM379, and DM4 to DM328 as the Dax index rose 11.18 to 2,036.52. Mr Ian McEwen at Merrill Lynch in London said that there was sense in this. 'German banks are cheaper relative to the market than they have ever been,' he said. 'They underperformed in 1992 and 1993 in spite of an excellent profit performance and they have underperformed again this year.' The sector, said Mr McEwen, will produce interim trading figures towards the end of this month, and in the first week of August. Within those, trading will be the volatile element after the bear market in global bonds this year. He expects the banks, in fact, to be in touch overall with 1993 performance, apart from Deutsche which has had a particular problem with interest margins. 'Among other things,' he said, 'Deutsche had the cheapest funding base, and when market rates come down the relative advantage of that base is eroded.' Turnover fell from DM7bn to DM5.9bn. After hours, there was excitement in Mannesmann on news that its management board chairman, Mr Werner Dieter, is under investigation by Dusseldorf prosecutors after allegations that he disguised private interests in a company which won huge orders from a Mannesmann subsidiary. The shares fell DM6 on the news to DM397, recovering to DM400. AMSTERDAM reversed early falls to end marginally firmer on position squaring ahead of the long US holiday weekend and in response to the better performance of the dollar. The AEX index put on 0.98 to 384.52, up 0.8 per cent on the week. DSM, the chemical group, added to the week's gains, which followed a positive analyst's note, gaining Fl 2.90 to Fl 129.50. Begemann, the troubled engineering group, dropped Fl 1.80 or 5.3 per cent to Fl 32.20, after a warning that it faced union demonstrations. A Fl 2 rise to Fl 46.20 in Pakhoed, the transport and storage group, was attributed to short covering. MILAN finished a lacklustre week in apathetic mood, still awaiting firm budget proposals from the government. The Comit index fell 6.09 to 683.50, down 2.2 per cent on the week, although the real time Mibtel index finished the day 4 higher at 10,923, reflecting a late pick up in some prices. The market was distracted by the resignation of the board of RAI, the state broadcaster, claiming political interference, which fuelled suggestions of political mismanagement by the government of Mr Silvio Berlusconi. Fiat was pulled back from a high of L6,405, to finish L2 lower at L6,374, again unable to make progress following Thursday's upbeat comments by Mr Giovanni Agnelli, the chairman, and the forecast that the group would return to profit this year. Among other blue chips, Pirelli finished L7 higher at L2,480, Montedison picked up L10 of the week's losses to L1,470 and Generali, the insurer, rebounded L143 to L40,783, but off a high of L41,150. PARIS ended 1 per cent down on the day and 1.8 per cent lower on the week, brokers saying that bonds were weak, French fund managers were absent and short of liquidity, and that foreign arbitrageurs were sellers. The CAC-40 index ended 19.14 lower at 1,872.86 in turnover of FFr3.31bn. Accor, the travel group, fell FFr19 to FFr595 after an intraday low for the year of FFr589 on a sell recommendation from Paribas. There was more trouble too, for money raisers in the Eurostock category, this time for Euro Disney which fell 50 centimes to a year's low of FFr11.25, against a rights issue price of FFr10. MADRID's domestic bonds suffered another weak and erratic day and it took late institutional support for equities to leave the general index only 1.06 lower at 299.08, off the intraday low of 297.40. Turnover was Pta31bn, but around Pta10bn of that was attributed to block trades. In banks, BBV fell Pta70 to Pta2,810; it said that net profits could fall by up to 20 per cent in the first half because of Pta25bn losses on the bank's fixed income portfolio. Of the other banks that may be affected by debt losses, Santander fell Pta35 to Pta4,700, and Argentaria by Pta60 to Pta5,040. Telefonica held firm again at Pta1,770 as the Spanish telecommunications company said that it had joined Unisource as its fourth member. Unisource, a joint venture including PTT Telecom Netherlands, Telia of Sweden and Swiss Telecom PTT until now, offers a range of telecommunications products for multinational companies. ZURICH continued to worry about the dollar and interest rates and prices fell in another derivatives led session. The SMI index fell 19.9 to 2,588.9, for a 0.5 per cent rise on the week. Banks remained under pressure with UBS losing SFr10 to SFr1,152, and insurers also slipped. Richemont, the Rothmans tobacco and Vendome luxury goods group, fell SFr20 to SFr1,060 as it reported a 45 per cent fall in consolidated net earnings in the year to March 31, mainly because of restructuring charges. STOCKHOLM fell 1.7 per cent, having picked up from early lows, as debt market yields climbed after Skandia, the insurer, said it was boycotting Swedish state bonds. The Affarsvarlden index fell 22.8 to 1,349.6 and brokers forecast further falls next week as the market grew increasingly concerned at the government's inability to put forward a budget deficit reduction programme. Skandia's share fell SKr3 to SKr105. ATHENS lost 1.5 per cent on the day, and a fraction less on the week in record low turnover for 1994, the general index falling 13.01 to 836.30. However, the market newcomer, Chipita, ended at the eight per cent upper volatility limit in its second day of trading, closing at Dr4,082. More than 9,000 Chipita shares changed hands and a queue formed to bid for some 150,000 shares, with none offered toward the close. COPENHAGEN was slightly lower on profit-taking but the market resisted strong downward pressure from falling bond prices. The KFX top-20 index lost 0.35 to 102.39. Shares in Danisco went against the trend to end DKr27 higher at DKr947 in response to Thursday's announcement of better than expected full year profits.  -------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Jul 1                               THE EUROPEAN SERIES  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes          Open     10.30     11.00      12.00  -------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100  1316.64   1314.41   1313.67    1313.20 FT-SE Eurotrack 200  1352.54   1351.81   1350.59    1351.26  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes         13.00     14.00     15.00      Close  -------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100  1316.40   1316.75   1314.53    1314.32 FT-SE Eurotrack 200  1354.80   1354.83   1353.14    1351.97  --------------------------------------------------------------------                       Jun 30    Jun 29    Jun 28    Jun 27    Jun 24  -------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100  1322.54   1331.90   1327.83   1313.43   1328.34 FT-SE Eurotrack 200  1352.98   1362.43   1354.56   1342.95   1354.15  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Base 1000 (26/10/90); High/day: 100 -  1316.99 ; 200 -  1355.86 Low/day: 100 -  1312.67  200 -  1349.84  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Written and edited by William Cochrane and Michael Morgan</p>

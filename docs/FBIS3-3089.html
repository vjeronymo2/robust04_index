			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Sino-U.S. Trade Will Continue"] </F>   [Text] U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher has  concluded his visit to China. Both sides are still taking a  forward-looking attitude toward the development of Sino-U.S.  relations. Both sides maintain that "Sino-U.S. relations are  very important and are willing to promote the improvement and  development of relations between the two countries." Warren  Christopher said: "Bill Clinton is determined to establish  extensive and more constructive relations with China. Both  sides should seize the opportunity and take action so that  bilateral relations can be further developed."    China and the United States have crossed swords frankly and  seriously on the human rights issue, but both sides have taken a  century-straddling long-term view toward the potential for  developing the relations between the two countries and  safeguarding the common interests of maintaining international  peace and security. This has enabled the two sides to reach  consensus on five areas, in which cooperation is possible.  First, both sides have agreed to continue to maintain the  momentum of high-level exchanges between the two countries. In  April this year, Song Jian and Wu Yi will attend a meeting of  the Sino-U.S. Science, Technology, Commerce, and Trade Committee  in the United States. This indicates that both sides want to  develop cooperation in science, technology, economy, and trade.  Second, the U.S. side has reaffirmed its firm support to the  restoration of China's status as a signatory state to the  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Third, China and the  United States have agreed to resume and develop exchanges  between the armed forces of the two countries, and both sides  have agreed to establish a committee for using the national  defense industry to produce products for civilians. Fourth, the  Chinese side has agreed to allow a U.S group to come to China in  the near future to carry out on-the-spot investigations on three  cases of missing U.S. personnel during the war in Vietnam.  Fifth, China and the United States have signed a statement on  cooperation in implementing the memorandum on prison products.    These results show that both China and the United States are  calmly aware of the tremendous benefits of bilateral  cooperation. This is in the interest of both countries. The  common interest of both sides is not confined to the economy.  On many hot spot issues of the world, China and the United  States need coordination and cooperation at the UN Security  Council. Both China and the United Stated have a tremendous  influence on international affairs and share some identical  views. They absolutely are capable of joining hands in settling  regional security and peace issues. Without China's  cooperation, the United States will not be able to properly  resolve many problems. Therefore, if the United States adopts a  policy of isolating China, it will also be isolated, and this  does not conform with its interest.    The Seattle Conference has laid a framework for the  development of Sino-U.S. relations. Since Warren Christopher  has admitted that the United States is not seeking a change in  China's social system but hopes to establish extensive and  stable relations with China, the question of how China and the  United States should get along peacefully has become the key to  developing relations in the future.    It is impossible to have genuine cooperation if one side  exerts pressure on the other side while talking about  cooperation and compels the other side to submit to, and act  according to, its will, treating the other side as a dependent.  Nor is it possible to develop long-term stable relations if one  country compels the other country to implement the  administrative order of its president and its laws.    Warren Christopher's diplomatic approach during his recent  visit to China remained an attempt to take a high-handed policy,  a practice which has divorced itself from the tide of history.  The U.S. national strength is less than it was in the past, and  the United States can no longer impose its will on its Western  allies in many international issues. The United States met with  a soft rebuff on the issues of Bosnia and Somali. In dealing  with its relations with Russia and Japan, the United States  failed to attain the anticipated results, despite the pressure  it had exerted. Even in handling its contradictions with Haiti  and the Philippines, the United States can no longer implement  the policy of wielding a big stick.    There are differences between China and the United States on  the human rights issue, and such differences do not only exist  between China and the United States. Similar sharp differences  also exist between the United States and many Third World  countries. In order to settle the differences, the United  States has adopted the policy of the stick and has advocated the  linkage of human rights with most favored nation trade status.  It has asserted that there are only a little over two months  left, and it is quite possible that the United States will not  give most favored nation trading status to China. This of  course has evoked the strong opposition of China. China has  advocated the separation of human rights from the most favored  nation issue. How can China submit to the United States and  accept the instructions of the administrative order of the U.S.  President? Would China not become the 51st state governed by  the U.S. President if it made such a concession?    The Chinese people have struggled over the past century and  more to make their country independent. Succeeding in making  the people rich and the country strong means the realization of  the right to subsistence and the right to development, the most  important human rights. Through thorough and frank dialogues  during his recent visit to China in his capacity as secretary of  state, Warren Christopher has very concretely understood China's  national policies and principles on the concept of human rights  and has understood that the three joint declarations remain the  foundation of Sino-U.S. relations. The spirit of these three  declarations is mutual noninterference in one another's internal  affairs.    Most favored nation status is not a favor which is bestowed  but is given mutually. The development of Sino-U.S. trade will  benefit both sides. Nevertheless, China will never agree to  become a dependent and lose its sovereignty and independence.  It will never act according to the order of the U.S. President  for the sake of most favored nation trading status.    Qian Qichen said yesterday: "I believe that Sino-U.S. trade  will continue." This is China's assessment of the prospects for  Sino-U.S. trade.    The U.S. Secretary of State came to visit China in order to  solve problems. The pattern was already fixed at the Seattle  Conference; China and the United States share an understanding;  and both the American business circles and people favor the  development of cooperation and diplomatic relations with China.  The two sides are currently at a difficult stage; however,  there should be ways to overcome the difficulties. Is it not  probable that the U.S. President will handle his own  administrative order after all?</p>

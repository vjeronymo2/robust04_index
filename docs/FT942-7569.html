			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Competitiveness - The White Paper: Business Links set to expand The government is to extend the role played by Business Links, the advice and help centres for smaller companies which Mr Michael Heseltine has championed. The measures for England could speed the pace at which chambers of commerce, training and enterprise councils, enterprise agencies and the Department of Trade and Industry form the Business Link partnerships. There are 22 Business Links; the DTI expects 50 to be in place by the end of the year, and full coverage for England by the end of 1995. Export support for small businesses is also extended, with about 70 new export advisers in Business Link offices.</p>

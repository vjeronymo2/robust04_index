			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / International Bonds: Ontario global offering raised to Dollars 2bn to meet demand THE Province of Ontario was the talk of the international bond markets yesterday with the launch of its Dollars 2bn, seven-year global bond offering. The deal was increased from Dollars 1.5bn to Dollars 2bn reflecting strong demand from investors in the Far East and Europe, and so dealers expect the bonds to be priced at the tighter end of the indicated range to yield 64 basis points over the US Treasury bond. The lead managers gave an indicated range of 64-66 basis points over the Treasury bond. The Province of Ontario, which has an AA2/AA credit rating, is a fairly frequent borrower in the international capital markets, usually preferring to launch global US dollar or Canadian dollar deals. Mr John Madden, assistant deputy minister of finance, said yesterday that the Province has a 1993-1994 borrowing requirement of CDollars 10bn. 'We have already pre-borrowed CDollars 2bn and this latest global bond issue is the equivalent of another CDollars 2.5bn,' he said. The Province of Ontario borrowed CDollars 14bn in fixed income in 1992-1993 to fund a CDollars 12bn deficit. Salomon Brothers, which is joint book-runner with Goldman Sachs, said investors were hungry for dollar bonds 'because there hasn't been that much sovereign or supranational paper in dollars and there won't be much in the seven-year area, so people want a good liquid benchmark'. The province's 10-year dollar paper is trading at a yield spread of about 70 basis points in the secondary market. The other main dollar deal of the day was LKB Baden Wurttemberg Finance's Dollars 500m 10-year bond issue. The deal, which was marketed as a 'hybrid dragon-Eurobond', was targetted at Asian and European investors. It was priced to yield 25 basis points over the US Treasury bond, but the spread widened out in the course of the day. Nomura, the lead manager, said the spread widened to 26-28 basis points, but other houses said they were quoting a spread of around 30 basis points in London. Elsewhere in the market, Deutsche Bank Finance raised Y50bn with a five-year bond issue lead managed by Daiwa Europe. The lead manager said this is the first public borrowing in yen by Deutsche Bank Finance. The proceeds were swapped into floating-rate yen because of the attractive arbitrage opportunities. Norsk-Hydro has launched a Dollars 300m Yankee bond issue in the US domestic market, writes Tracy Corrigan. The 30-year non-callable bonds carry a coupon of 7 3/4 per cent and were priced to yield 97 basis points over the comparable US Treasury. The deal was arranged by Morgan Stanley. Standard &amp; Poor's, the credit rating agency, said it has lowered its senior long-term rating for debt issued by Rhone-Poulenc, the French chemicals group, to A- from A, while the short-term rating has been lowered to A-2 from A-1. A meeting between Bulgarian government officials and commercial bank creditors has produced no results so far, according to a spokesman for Deutsche Bank, the German bank hosting the talks, Reuter reports from Frankfurt. The talks focus on Bulgaria's ability to pay interest and principal on its Dollars 9.3bn foreign bank debt. The two sides are split on the size of the payments, which are part of a debt restructuring package.</p>

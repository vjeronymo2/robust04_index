			<p><P> November 3, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> PROSECUTOR DEFENDS ARSON ARREST DELAY  </P> <P> A Riverside County prosecutor Thursday defended his decision to wait 2 1/2  years in arresting a former Israeli beauty queen on charges of arson and  insurance fraud involving her Palm Springs home.  </P> <P> Orly Hadida, who was married to Santa Ana surgeon Ron Lapin and acquitted in a  highly publicized Orange County child-stealing case in 1988, was arrested by an  investigator of the Riverside County district attorney's office during a  monitored visitation with her two children Oct. 18.  </P> <P> Hadida's attorney, John Horwitz of Santa Ana, criticized the location and  timing of the arrest and said it occurred 10 days after she filed for increased  visitation time.  </P> <P> But Riverside County prosecutor David B. Downing rejected any notion that her  arrest was unfair.  </P> <P> "I don't know anything about the status of her, her husband or her kids, and I  couldn't care less," Downing said.  </P> <P> "We needed to take some witnesses' statements and had to wait. We had heard  that she never gave a sworn statement to her insurance company, and then we  heard otherwise and had to wait and get the statement," he said.  </P> <P> The arrest stems from an arson fire at Hadida's Palm Springs home the night of  June 2, 1987. The home, with an estimated value of between $200,000 and  $300,000, was awarded to her as a part of her divorce agreement.  </P> <P> Downing, who did not have exact figures, characterized the damage as  "substantial" to the structure and its contents.  </P> <P> "At the time, she was separated from her husband, but the home was in her name  and not her husband's, Ron Lapin," Downing said.  </P> <P> He said Hadida had been living at the home, which was unoccupied at the time of  the fire. No one was injured in the blaze.  </P> <P> Palm Springs fire investigators said that flammable liquids were used to set  the house on fire, Downing said.  </P> <P> "She made a claim to the insurance company, but they didn't pay her anything,"  Downing said.  </P> <P> Hadida pleaded not guilty to two felony charges of arson and insurance fraud  during an arraignment in Palm Springs last month. A preliminary hearing has  been scheduled in Palm Springs Jan. 25.  </P> <P> Horwitz said he took exception with the decision to arrest his client in view  of the long period after the incident, and that Downing had been quoted in a  newspaper as saying that no new dramatic evidence had been uncovered in the  investigation.  </P> <P> "I don't know what the catalyst is," Horwitz said. "The deputy district  attorney in the case says he really hasn't gotten any new evidence, and then  she's arrested 2 1/2 years later."  </P> <P> Hadida remains free on $10,000 bail.

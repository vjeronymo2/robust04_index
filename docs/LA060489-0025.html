			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOME SEE NO HUMOR IN 'SEE NO EVIL'  </P> <P> We saw the movie "See No Evil, Hear No Evil" because it was supposed to be a  comedy and it was advertised as a box-office hit.  </P> <P> We were appalled at the language . . . four-letter words used throughout the  movie.  </P> <P> It made me wonder if the movies aren't to blame for the downfall of morals and  ethics over the years.  </P> <P> In the '20s and '30s actors and actresses were constantly shown with a  cigarette, and smoking was widely accepted. It's taken all these years for  anti-smoking crusades to educate the public.  </P> <P> Then came the introduction of promiscuousness into the movies . . . the  bordellos, madams, mistresses, etc., all seemed to be a topic of fun and  mischievousness.  </P> <P> Then there was pot smoking (even though at times it was presented as an evil).  </P> <P> Now foul language has been used so much that I observed teen-agers in the  audience laughing and even cheering whenever it was heard.  </P> <P> Do we really need all this in the name of entertainment? What happened to the  movies with a moral, or with a story to present, or with a happy ending? A few  that come to mind are: "An Affair to Remember," "With Six You Get Egg Roll,"  "It Happened One Night" and "Karate Kid."  </P> <P> I suggest movie and TV script writers and producers clean up their act.  Whatever happened to "Speak No Evil"?  </P> <P> BETTY ALMQUIST  </P> <P> Cathedral City  </P></p>

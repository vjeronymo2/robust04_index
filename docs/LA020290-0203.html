			<p><P> February 2, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MASUR'S WIN TIES FRANCE, AUSTRALIA;  </P> <P> DAVIS CUP: DEFENDING CHAMPION WEST GERMANY OVERCOMES BECKER'S ABSENCE TO TAKE  2-0 LEAD OVER THE NETHERLANDS.  </P> <P> Australia's Wally Masur, down two sets to one, came back for a victory over  Yannick Noah of France today and tied the first-round Davis Cup competition  between their countries at 1-1.  </P> <P> Masur, Australia's highest-ranked player at 36th in the world, beat Noah 4-6,  6-3, 4-6, 6-3, 6-2 in the second singles match at Perth, Australia.  </P> <P> Henri Leconte opened for France with a 6-3, 7-5, 6-3 victory over Darren  Cahill.  </P> <P> Noah, ranked 16 in the world, will team with doubles specialist Guy Forget  against John Fitzgerald and former Wimbledon champion Pat Cash, making a  comeback after rupturing an Achilles' tendon, in the doubles Saturday. The  reverse singles will be played Sunday, with Masur playing Leconte and Noah  taking on Cahill.  </P> <P> In another Davis Cup match, defending champion West Germany overcame the  absence of Boris Becker and took a 2-0 lead over the Netherlands at Bremen,  West Germany today.  </P> <P> Carl-Uwe Steeb defeated Michiel Schapers 6-1, 4-6, 6-3, 6-3, and Eric Jelen  took the second singles of the best-of-five series by beating Tom Nijssen 7-6  (7-5), 7-5, 3-6, 6-3.  </P> <P> Becker, the Wimbledon and U.S. Open champion who led West Germany to Davis Cup  triumphs in 1988 and 1989, quit last week, leaving Steeb as its No. 1.  </P> <P> "I felt under pressure but it was also nice to carry the responsibility," Steeb  said.  </P> <P> Jelen, usually Becker's Davis Cup doubles partner who has rarely played singles  for the team, needed two hours and 43 minutes to beat Nijssen.  </P> <P> At Bagliari, Sardinia, Paolo Cane dropped the first two sets to Sweden's Jonas  Svensson but fought back for a 3-6, 2-6, 6-3, 6-3, 6-1 victory that gave Italy  a 1-0 lead in the first round.  </P> <P> Mats Wilander was leading Italy's Omar Camporese 6-4, 6-4, 5-7 when their  second singles match was suspended because of darkness. It will resume  Saturday.  </P> <P> Sweden, a Davis Cup finalist the last two years, is playing without Stefan  Edberg, who said before he was injured during the Australian Open finals that  he would not play against Italy.  </P> <P> At Barcelona, Thomas Muster and Horst Skoff won their opening Davis Cup singles  matches today and gave Austria a 2-0 lead over Spain.  </P> <P> Muster defeated Emilio Sanchez 1-6, 6-2. 4-6, 6-3, 6-4, and Skoff defeated  Sergio Bruguera 6-4, 7-5, 6-0.  </P> <P> Yugoslavia staved off elimination in its Davis Cup competition with New Zealand  when Slobodan Zivojinovic and teen-ager Goran Ivanisevic teamed for a doubles  victory today at Christchurch. They downed Kelly Evernden and Steve Guy 7-5,  6-3, 6-7 (4-7) 7-5.  </P> <P> New Zealand won the opening two singles matches Thursday.  </P></p>

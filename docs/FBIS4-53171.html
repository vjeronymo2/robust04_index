			<p>BFN     [Text] This year's annual "May 15 Peace Parade" (sponsored  by the Okinawa Peace Movement Center) kicked off at 0930 (local  time) on 13 May at three different locations in Okinawa,  including the Peace Prayer Park in Itoman city and the Nago city  office. The parade has traditionally been held to appeal for  the establishment of peace in Okinawa through the removal of  U.S. military bases. Participants in the parade will continue  marching until they reach their destination, which is a  beachside park in Kadena Township where a general rally is to be  held on 15 May. The event has been held 16 times in the past.    A total of about 2,000 participants, including about 800  from  other prefectures, are expected to participate in the parade.  About 5,000 participants are expected to gather at the general  rally. A ceremony was held at the Peace Prayer Park to mark the  beginning of the parade for the group of marchers who plan to  take the southern route starting in Itoman city. There were  about 400 participants at the ceremony.    In a speech greeting the participants, Zenshun Arakaki,  chairman of the Peace Movement Center, said: "The existence of a  `secret deal between the Japanese and U.S. Governments for  bringing nuclear weapons to Okinawa' has been revealed. We have  learned that the three nonnuclear principles were only a hoax.  Moreover, the ruling coalition government is planning to enact  emergency legislation by taking advantage of the issue of the  DPRK's (North Korea) suspected nuclear weapons development  program. What we really need is a nuclear inspection of U.S.  military bases on Okinawa." Arakaki encouraged the marchers by  saying, "Let us complete our parade."    In their speeches, local representatives of various parties  one after the other stressed the seriousness of the issue of the  secret deal regarding bringing nuclear weapons to Okinawa.  Representatives from other prefectures also said: "For Okinawa,  the postwar period is not yet over. The reversion of Okinawa to  Japan was a fraud."</p>

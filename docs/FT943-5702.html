			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / US and N Korea agree to meet in Pyongyang: Nuclear talks will parallel diplomatic discussions US and North Korean officials will meet in Pyongyang next week to discuss the opening of liaison offices in the two countries. Such a move would be a significant step towards establishing diplomatic relations. Simultaneously, the two sides will meet in Berlin to discuss a US offer of light-water reactors, the supply of interim energy sources to North Korea while these reactors are being constructed, and the disposal of North Korea's spent fuel rods, which are capable of producing enough plutonium for five nuclear bombs. The meetings, which will begin on September 10, are the result of last month's US-North Korean framework agreement. Under the accord, Pyongyang promised to accept full international nuclear inspections in return for improved ties with Washington and the supply of safe reactors to replace its dangerous graphite ones. The talks confirm North Korea's willingness to abide by the agreement, while they also offer evidence that the succession of power in Pyongyang by Mr Kim Jong-il is proceeding smoothly after the death of his father, President Kim Il-sung, in July. Officials in Seoul said it was unlikely that the US negotiators would have been allowed to go to Pyongyang if a serious power struggle was under way in North Korea, as has been rumoured in recent days. The talks are a preparatory step to the resumption of high-level bilateral negotiations, which will begin on September 23 in Geneva and are intended to achieve a final settlement of the North Korean nuclear dispute. South Korean officials expressed concern that North Korea had already won a diplomatic victory by persuading the US to hold discussions about the establishment of relations in the North Korean capital. The opening of liaison offices was used by the US to establish links with China in the early 1970s after decades of hostility. There are signs of increased friction between South Korea and the US on the proposed settlement of the nuclear issue. Some officials in Seoul are criticising the US for rushing towards an agreement with North Korea. Meanwhile, Mr Kim Pyong-il, stepbrother of Mr Kim Jong-il, said that the latter would shortly take formal power in North Korea, as the official assumption of leadership has been delayed because of an extended mourning period for his father.</p>

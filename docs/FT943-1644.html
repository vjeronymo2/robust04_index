			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Overseas equities fall out of favour Institutions invested less in the second quarter of the year than the first but increased purchases of domestic equities and property, government figures released yesterday show, Simon London writes. Net investment in all financial assets fell to Pounds 10.18bn from a record Pounds 14bn in the first three months of the year. Net investment last year averaged Pounds 12.5bn a quarter, stronger than analysts had anticipated and helping to support financial markets. The biggest decline was in purchases of overseas equities, which fell to Pounds 800m from more than Pounds 3bn in the first quarter. Pension funds divested a net Pounds 1.3bn of overseas shares, while life insurance companies continued buying but at a slower rate. UK government bonds also attracted less money, with Pounds 3.5bn added to institutional portfolios against Pounds 4.2bn in the first three months of the year. In contrast, Pounds 5.3bn was invested in UK equities, up from Pounds 4.9bn in the first quarter, while net investment in property and land rose sharply to Pounds 1.4bn from Pounds 276m. The flow of funds into property was led by life insurance companies, which invested a record Pounds 1.5bn in the three months to the end of June. Pension funds were net sellers of property, shedding Pounds 246m-worth in the same period.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is proposing a flexible control strategy for the reduction of emissions from ships. This strategy would rely on economic incentives to encourage operators of ships that frequently use Southern California ports to take the necessary steps to reduce their emissions. Specifically, an emissions fee would be based on the type of emission control that a particular ship used. Ship operators would be allowed (and encouraged) to reduce the fees which would be applied by using electrical onshore power service instead of the ship's engines while in port. Ships that use South Coast ports more frequently would be faced with higher annual fees, and therefore would have a greater incentive to install more efficient emission control devices to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduce or eliminate those fees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In Ventura, there are no large ports, but marine vessel emissions are still large contributors to the area's NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  inventory, because of the emissions that are blown onshore from passing ships by the prevailing winds. The FIP includes in its fee system provisions for encouraging ships to move further out to sea when passing the Ventura coastline.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Programs to Reduce Vehicle Miles Traveled. Passenger cars, light and heavy trucks, buses, and motorcycles have met increasingly stringent new vehicle standards for years, and industrial sources of pollution have installed increasingly sophisticated controls to reduce emissions. But the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> trends in the total emissions of VOCs and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  barely show any reduction over time. One reason for this is the growth in economic activity which causes increases in emissions from stationary and area sources; another reason is the fact that the number of vehicle miles traveled (VMT) has grown, significantly undercutting the impact of improved vehicle emission controls.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> VMT is increasing for several reasons: more Americans are working; travel by automobile is cheap and convenient; alternatives to automobile travel are not convenient or do not exist at all in many situations; workers commute suburb to suburb; and workers commute many miles each way in order to be able to afford a single family home. But there are things that local communities can do to change some of the factors that cause the reliance on the automobile. Land use and zoning policies can support mass transportation and car pooling as they now support single occupant vehicle travel. Investments can be made in providing travel alternatives for work and leisure. Communities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> can begin to make the real cost of driving be reflected in fee systems for parking or use of congested roadways during peak hours. EPA does not have the authority to make the land use planning policies that would be effective in reducing VMT growth in the FIP areas. The Agency could impose fees on passenger vehicles in the FIP, but it could not return the revenue that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be collected to the local area to support transportation alternatives. Therefore, the FIP focuses primarily on additional requirements for improvements in vehicle technology which will contribute to a decrease in per vehicle emissions. But, EPA has also considered whether there are controls which can be imposed via a federal implementation plan which can lead to reductions in vehicle miles traveled. Two measures are proposed in today's NPRM:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Employee Commute Options Program. EPA is proposing two alternative attainment dates for the Sacramento area. The first is the 1999 attainment date which is required by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, for areas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> classified as serious nonattainment for ozone. EPA is also proposing to bump the Sacramento area up to the severe classification with a 2005 attainment date. Under the Clean Air Act, severe ozone nonattainment areas must implement employee commute options (ECO) programs designed to reduce work-related  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> trips and vehicle miles traveled during peak commuting periods. Specifically, employers with 100 or more employees must develop and implement a plan to encourage employees to use alternatives to the single occupant vehicle commute. Both the South Coast and the Ventura areas have implemented ECO programs, but the Sacramento area has not yet enacted the necessary legal authority, although an ECO program is required under California law. Elsewhere in this NPRM, EPA is proposing to approve the South Coast ECO program. Although EPA is not at this time prepared to approve the Ventura ECO program, EPA need not do so as part of this FIP. Even though EPA is similarly not required to promulgate an ECO program for Sacramento at this time, EPA is proposing to do so because the obligation of Sacramento to do an ECO program under federal law would be a direct result of EPA's proposed bump-up. EPA is therefore proposing an ECO program for the Sacramento area to be implemented if the area's classification is changed to severe. Affected employers must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within two years develop programs which are designed to increase the vehicle occupancy of their employees to a target which is 25 percent above the current average vehicle occupancy for all commute trips in the area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Parking Cash Out. Even in downtown areas, most employees in California receive free or subsidized parking spaces. Current tax codes allow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employers to offer this benefit without the employer or the employee having to pay taxes on the value of the space. Since parking costs represent the bulk of the daily cost of driving to work, these ``free'' spaces are a strong incentive for employees to drive to work alone.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As part of his Climate Change Action Plan, President Bill Clinton has called for transforming much of the existing tax subsidy for employer-paid parking into a powerful reward for commuters to ride transit, carpool, or find other ways to get to work. The Administration will shortly propose changes in the tax law necessary to bring about parking subsidy reform. This same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal is included in the FIP, in a form which is consistent with EPA's authority. The proposal does not modify the tax code or require payments by an employer. Rather it applies certain restrictions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

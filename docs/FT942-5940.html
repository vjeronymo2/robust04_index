			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Sample the soap, buy the brand - Freebies through the door can exert a powerful influence on consumers Selling soap does have its glamorous side - at least that is what the advertising agencies claim. The current television campaign which heralds the UK launch of the soap powder Persil Power 'captures all the drama, suspense and intrigue of a big epic movie', enthuses agency J Walter Thompson. Radio-controlled puppets, specially-composed music and a 60ft-by-100ft model village, have all gone into the advertisement for the product which recently found itself at the centre of a row between its creator, Unilever, and soap war rivals Procter &amp; Gamble. Procter suggested that Persil Power's patented 'Accelerator' action would rot fabrics - a charge responded to with outrage by Unilever. But while the Titans clashed, and the TV 'epic' was completed and then beamed to a waiting nation, a far more prosaic marketing exercise was also beginning. Thousands of men and women were being recruited to deliver free samples of Persil Power door-to-door so that consumers could actually try the stuff. In one of the largest sampling programmes ever attempted, it is estimated that more than two-thirds of all UK households will receive trial packs of the soap powder over the coming weeks. Sampling, says Ed Lyons, the marketing manager in charge of the project, is central to the soap powder's Pounds 25m launch campaign. The challenge is 'to ensure that the highest levels of awareness and interest are created and then converted into brand trial', he says. Sampling gives consumers 'the all-important opportunity to experience the brand and judge for themselves that the promise is delivered'. There is evidence that, for consumers, sampling is rated above all other forms of marketing communication, according to the Human Factor, a consultancy which has conducted market research for the two leading sample distribution companies, Circular Distributors and MRM Distributions. Elaine Hunt, research director, says: 'Sampling is the only form of unsolicited communication which is received without suspicion or annoyance. Psychologically, sampling creates an unusual climate in these days of the cynical consumer, who prides herself on seeing through all the wiles of the advertiser. 'The sample appears more in the nature of a gift - something for nothing - and the recipient seems to feel a more personal gratitude and pleasure than is inspired by most other forms of media activity.' Consumer enthusiasm is markedly stronger for genuinely 'free' samples, rather than those which require the consumer to expend effort or cash. The acceptability of a freebie is hardly surprising, but does sampling actually work? Hunt says that both for new products and those that have been around for some time, consumers cite sampling as the most powerful influence on whether they purchase, 'easily outweighing advertising, money-off offers, or couponing'. Nick Wells, sales and marketing director of Circular Distributors, the company which is carrying out the Persil Power door-to-door deliveries, estimates that sampling has grown five-fold in the UK over the past decade, with a total of about 250m samples delivered through the door last year. While volumes have increased, the sophistication of sampling techniques has also developed since the 1950s, when the first exercise, for Omo soap powder, was carried out. There are two basic methods of sampling: letterbox and personal call. The first is suitable for items, which fit through the door and are non-toxic (there are Advertising Standard Authority rules to protect against, for example, children picking up and eating samples of household cleaning products). The samples may go out on their own or be delivered with other items, which makes the exercise cheaper. CD says it would charge about Pounds 17 per 1,000 for the delivery of 30g samples if they were delivered with other items, while 'solus' distribution would cost about Pounds 35. Personal call sampling costs about 10 times more, says Wells. Delivery staff ring at the door and ask the householder questions to establish whether they have a use for the sample before handing it over. This helps cut down waste by ensuring, for example, that dog food only goes to dog owners. But the personal call also provides an opportunity for market research data to be collected, coupons to be handed out or a database of customers interested in future promotions to be assembled. MRM Distributions is even experimenting with the direct input of data on the doorstep, using laptop computers. Wells's tips for sampling success include: make sure, if it is a letterbox delivery, that the sample is strong enough to withstand the family dog; make the packaging look as much like the real thing as possible; and avoid looking mean with samples which are too small to allow a proper trial. Sampling would rarely be used in isolation, says Phil Annett, new products marketing manager for Cereal Partners UK, the joint venture between Nestle and General Mills. He is particularly interested in targeting children for many of the company's new product launches, which have included the cereals Golden Grahams and Lucky Charms. As well as door-to-door sampling, Cereal Partners looks for distribution at toy shop checkouts and with doorstep milk deliveries. 'If you can do it through a third party it adds endorsement,' says Annett. Sampling is unlikely to be effective on its own, says Annett. 'We believe it should be used as part of a programme which includes advertising and promotion. But it is the ultimate form of product communication - actually to receive and taste the product. You can only do so much on television,' he concludes.  ------------------------------------------------- What influences the buyer?  ------------------------------------------------- % Claiming to have bought a new product because: Free sample to try                        85 Recommendation by friends or relatives    83 Money-off offer                           75 Television advertisement                  67 Saw in a shop                             67 Money-off coupon or voucher               62 Advertising leaflet through the door      55  ------------------------------------------------- Source: MRM, The Human Factor 1993  -------------------------------------------------</p>

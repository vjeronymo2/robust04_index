			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Survey of Investment in Quebec (7): Recession, failures curb enthusiasm - Financial Services QUEBEC led the push for Canadian financial services deregulation in the early 1980s, but the enthusiasm has since been tempered by recession and some spectacular corporate failures. The province was tilting at the four pillars of Canadian financial services  -banks, trusts, insurance and investment dealing - even before the national debate on deregulation began in 1985. Mr Jacques Parizeau, then the province's finance minister, argued for broad deregulation and more competition, and accused Ottawa of dragging its feet. The powerful Desjardins credit union group, with Dollars 45bn in assets, backed him, eager to keep its grip on Quebec's retail banking and to flex its muscles in corporate lending and other services. Most Quebec institutions, such as National Bank of Canada and the life insurance firms, welcomed the idea of new powers and more competition, stressing an entrepreneurial approach to financial services. Some began buying sprees. But others such as Industrial-Alliance, the province's biggest locally-owned insurance group, were more cautious. Now, Quebec - struggling with recession - finds itself having to adjust not only to its own deregulation moves, but also changes in the rules for federally-regulated banks, insurers and trust companies which are expected to take effect this month. One insurance executive in Montreal says Quebec's liberal regulatory regime may have contributed to the recent failure of Cooperants Mutual Life, a Quebec-based company. The Cooperants failure has prompted a behind-the-scenes debate on tightening some of the province's insurance regulations. The Quebec financial services industry generally feels, however, that the new federal legislation falls short and that a 'rendezvous with history' may have been missed, says Mr Claude Forget, senior vice-president of The Laurentian Group, a full-service institution. On one hand, Quebec is pleased that the federal reforms level the playing field among institutions. For example, they will allow banks for the first time to buy trust and insurance companies, and insurers to buy trusts. But there are strict conditions on the banks' ability to offer insurance and fiduciary products. Banks and trusts cannot lease cars and distribute insurance through their branches - less than Quebec wanted. Banks have been allowed to buy investment dealers since 1987. The formation of a national securities commission, a key issue for Quebec, has been delayed indefinitely. Securities trading is a provincial jurisdiction. The new 'deregulated' national industry faces a highly complex federal supervisory system. The Bank Act has gone from 255 pages to 342 containing 604 sections against 316; the Insurance Act from 173 pages to 406 with 762 sections against 238. Detailed regulations are yet to come. 'The legislation does break down barriers,' says Mr Forget. But the failures of two western banks, several Ontario trust companies and Cooperants Life in Quebec made legislators cautious. 'It strengthens controls of all kinds in trying to achieve financial-sector security,' Mr Forget says. Regulatory compliance will require elaborate corporate procedures to track authorisations and restrictions, threatening lengthy delays. Institutions may not compete effectively from their domestic bases and controls may create a false sense of security, he says. While deregulation has been the dominant theme for seven years, Quebec-based banks, trusts, insurance firms and the diversified Desjardins group have faced heavy domestic mortgage repossessions and write-offs on sour corporate loans. The worst appears to be past for loans within Canada, with the notable exception of Montreal-based National Bank of Canada's exposure to property developer Olympia &amp; York. Deregulation and tough economic conditions are leading to greater financial services concentration in Quebec. Several independent Quebec securities firms have disappeared in recent years. The largest brokerage firm in the province, Levesque Beaubien Geoffrion, is now a National Bank subsidiary. Meanwhile, some assets of the failed Cooperants insurance group have been acquired by Desjardins and Industrial-Alliance. Paying off policyholders may cost the insurance industry well over Dollars 100m via its consumer protection fund. Quebec property and casualty firms have been under severe margin pressure for two years, bringing more concentration and new international ties. The Montreal stock exchange, with almost 100 per cent electronic trading, was profitable last year and has kept its share of the value of equity trading in Canada at about 20 per cent. It has scored some successes in developing its niche derivative products, notably Government of Canada bond futures.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sanaa has rejected the dispatch of Arab forces to  stop the war in Yemen, saying that what is happening in Yemen is  a domestic affair and could be decided internally, according to  sources of the General People's Congress, which is led by  President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih.    Salih dismissed the Yemeni oil minister and the Aden  governor, both of whom belong to the Yemeni Socialist Party led  by 'Ali Salim al-Bid.    Our correspondent Tawfiq Jazulit reported a short time ago  that south Yemeni fighter planes staged several raids tonight on  Sanaa. Six Scud missiles fell on the city during the day while 2  northern planes raided Aden. The northerners have announced  that they are preparing to launch an attack on Aden on several  fronts.</p>

			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / German rate cut unlikely, say bankers PROSPECTS of cuts in German interest rates next week to help support the French franc dimmed yesterday as a member of the Bundesbank council warned that reductions could not be made 'at the drop of a hat'. Mr Reimut Jochimsen, president of the central bank of North Rhine-Westphalia, said he supported the means which France had mobilised to defend the franc - yesterday's sharp rise in overnight lending rates. But he indicated that he felt it was the wrong time for a reduction in German rates. Private economists suggested a cut large enough to help relieve the pressure on the French franc - 1 percentage point - was unlikely, although some believed a gesture was needed at next Thursday's central council meeting. Mr Rainer Veit of Deutsche Bank said he could hardly imagine that the Bundesbankers would simply pack up and go away for their traditional four-week summer break without doing anything. That might be seen as a sign they were not interested in the European monetary system, according to Mr Gerhard Grebe of Bank Julius Bar. Mr Jochimsen said on television that everything had to be done to maintain faith in the stability of the D-Mark and Bundesbank policy. June inflation of 4.2 per cent was unsatisfactory and July would not look much better, while money supply was still expanding above target, he said. July inflation figures, expected next week, are forecast to be unchanged or even slightly up on the June rate. Until this week many economists had expected a pre-holiday cut at next Thursday's meeting as a sign that the bank was willing to offer a fillip to help the German economy off the bottom of the recession and improve confidence in economies elsewhere. Central bank officials had encouraged the mood with cautiously up-beat comments on money supply and inflation since the Bundesbank's last move three weeks ago, when the discount and Lombard rates were reduced to 6.75 per cent and 8.25 per cent respectively. However, the optimism all but evaporated this week when it was revealed that money supply growth had accelerated further in June to a provisional annualised rate of 7.1 per cent after 6.9 per cent in May. The M3 measure is still being driven up by heavy state borrowing, and is expected to be adversely affected in coming months as the effects of recent interventions in support of the franc are felt.</p>

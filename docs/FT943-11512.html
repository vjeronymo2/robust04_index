			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / International Company News: US carriers confirm tentative recovery Delta and Continental, two leading US airlines, yesterday provided further evidence of the industry's tentative recovery by posting improved second-quarter operating results. Delta, the country's third biggest carrier, announced a 61 per cent surge in operating income to Dollars 92.3m, excluding a Dollars 413.7m pre-tax charge related to a restructuring programme announced last April. The result reflects a 1.5 per cent gain in operating revenues to Dollars 3.18m, and a 4 per cent upturn in operating revenue in terms of available passenger seats. The higher return more than offset a slight increase in operating expenses to Dollars 3.09bn. Net income, excluding the provision, was marginally ahead at Dollars 10.8m, against Dollars 7.2m in the second three months of 1993. However, the bottom line was a loss of 33 cents a share, against a deficit of 41 cents in the year-earlier period. In spite of the progress, Mr Ronald Allen, Delta's chairman, said the airline was still a long way from achieving its goal of sustained profitability. Meanwhile, Continental, the Texas-based carrier which emerged form its second bankruptcy in April 1993, narrowed its operating loss to Dollars 1.5m on revenues of Dollars 1.4bn. The result represents a considerable improvement on the 1993 quarter, when the airline posted an operating deficit of Dollars 62m on Dollars 1.45bn in revenues. Operating expenses were sharply lower at Dollars 1.39bn, against Dollars 1.51bn in the corresponding period of 1993. The net loss for the most recent quarter was Dollars 48.9m, or Dollars 1.97 a share. The previous year's figures are not comparable because the company was recapitalised when it emerged from Chapter 11. PWA, parent of Canadian Airlines International, posted a small profit for the June quarter, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. Second-quarter operating income was CDollars 31.6m (USDollars 22m) against a CDollars 16.7m loss a year earlier. Net profit was CDollars 1.5m, against a loss of CDollars 131m last time which included a CDollars 86m restructuring expense. Revenues were CDollars 727m, up 6.7 per cent.</p>

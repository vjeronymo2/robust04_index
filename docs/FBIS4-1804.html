			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Ling Zi (0407 1311): "Racking One's Brains Is to No </F> Avail"]    [Text] Recently, public opinion in some Western countries  has tried hard to play up allegations that China has increased  its military spending by a big margin and that this "constitutes  a threat" to its neighbors. This is nothing but an attempt to  sow discord between China and its bordering countries and to  incite an anti-China feeling. What is the reality?    According to reports by the London Institute of  International  Strategic Studies and the Stockholm International Peace Research  Institute, authoritative Western organs, China's national  defense spending is not much in fact. Take, for instance, the  years 1991 and 1992. The U.S. national defense budgets for  these two years were $290.9 billion and $270.9 billion  respectively but the figures for China were only $6.13 billion  and $6.73 billion respectively, only 2.1 and 2.4 percent of the  U.S. budget figures. The percentage of per capita military  spending is even less. The per capita military spending figures  for the United States in those two years were $1,155 and $1,076  respectively but those for China were only $5 and $6. The per  capita military spending of China is only 0.43 and 0.55 percent  of those of the United States. Even if compared with those of  the bordering countries, China's national defense budget cannot  be ranked among the top three and the ranking of its per capita  military spending is much lower.    China has increased its national defense budget by a small  amount this year. However, as Vice Premier and concurrently  Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said: "As a matter of fact, this  is mainly to make up for the increase in commodity prices."    How can China's military spending be considered large when  viewed from the facts? China has always pursued a foreign  policy of peace and has made efforts to safeguard world peace.  This is known to all. Racking one's brains in an attempt to  make use of the issue of military spending to incite an  anti-China feeling is completely to no avail.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As stated in the February 28, 1994 NPRM, the establishment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of a maximum time frame would take into account a student's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enrollment status. Institutions are currently required to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitor enrollment status of students receiving Title IV, HEA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program funds and 150% of published program length can and should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be viewed only in the context of an individual student's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enrollment status. Thus, if a nontraditional student who is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enrolled in a baccalaureate program that a full-time student is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expected to complete in four years and a half-time student is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expected to complete in eight years, vacillates between full-time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and half-time enrollment, that student would have a computed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maximum enrollment period somewhere between six and 12 years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, because the requirement is designed to set an upper  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limit on the period of time for which a student may receive Title  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> IV, HEA program assistance, periods of nonenrollment, during  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which the student is not receiving Title IV, HEA program funds,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would not be counted against the length of time the student is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pursuing a degree or certificate. Thus, a student who enrolls  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and receives Title IV, HEA program funds sporadically would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treated differently from a full-time student who pursues a degree  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or certificate without interruption.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (e)(1)(vii) of this section requires an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution to have procedures under which a student may appeal a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination that the student is not making satisfactory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> progress. With regard to eligible programs of an academic year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or less, these regulations make even clearer the longstanding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement that the maximum time frame must be divided into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increments. Satisfactory academic progress policies are expected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to measure whether students are progressing satisfactorily toward  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their educational goals and should serve also as a device for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> counseling students about their need to improve their progress,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if applicable. If maximum time frames are not divided into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increments, these policies are not serving their purpose. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> principle applies to programs shorter than an academic year no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> less than to longer programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Section 668.16(e)(3)(B) is amended to clarify that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maximum time frame in which a student must complete his or her  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> educational program must be no longer than 150 percent of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> published length of the educational program for full-time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> students.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Two commenters recommended expanding the requirement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that an institution must develop and apply an adequate system to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identify and resolve discrepancies in the information that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution receives to include documentation of a student's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> social security number. They reasoned that resolution of social  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> security number discrepancies is an important part of controlling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fraud and abuse in the Title IV, HEA programs and the ability of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an institution to obtain appropriate documentation to resolve  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such discrepancies should be considered in determining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative capability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary concurs with the commenters that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resolution of social security number discrepancies is essential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and should be expressly stated in this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Section 668.16(f)(3) is amended to include  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> documentation of a student's social security number in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information normally available to an institution and for which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the institution must have a system to identify and resolve  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discrepancies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  About half the commenters expressed concern, to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> varying degrees, that the proposed reporting requirement is too  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vague and broad and would result in overreporting that would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> overwhelm the Office of Inspector General. Some of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters recommended that the word ``evidence'' replace  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``information.'' Other commenters suggested that there be some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> kind of internal review or discussion. Several commenters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommended that institutions continue to make referrals to local  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> law enforcement officials or at least consult with them. Two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters wanted assurance that the institution would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protected in the event that it made a referral.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary cannot accept the substitution of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``evidence'' for ``information'' because that the word ``evidence'' has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> legal ramifications. Evidence is normally determined in a court  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of law when the judge determines what permissible evidence is.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Institutions may contact the Office of Investigations within the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Office of Inspector General for advice before making a formal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> referral. The Secretary also cannot accept the suggestion that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions establish an internal review mechanism prior to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> referral as such a mechanism may work to block appropriate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> referrals. However, the Secretary believes that an institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should only be required to refer to the Office of the Inspector  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> General of the Department of Education  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> credible <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicating fraud and abuse.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary sees no problem with institutions making  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concurrent referrals to local law enforcement authorities, but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cannot support the referral to local authorities as an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative to making referrals to the Office of Inspector  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> General. Concurrent referrals can be made with the regulation as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> written; no change is necessary. The Secretary cannot guaranty  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protection to institutions or individuals that make referrals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Section 668.16(g) has been amended to clarify that an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution must only refer to the Office of the Inspector  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> General of the Department of Education  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> credible <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicating fraud and abuse.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Almost two-thirds of the commenters supported the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concept of requiring institutions that serve significant numbers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of students with special needs to have and implement plans for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> providing students with information about how to meet their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> needs, but half of these commenters recommended that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement be imposed only on institutions with high withdrawal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rates. Two commenters recommended that institutions be required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actually to provide the necessary support services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters suggested that students with language  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> barriers be considered to have special needs. One commenter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggested that students from low socio-economic background, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined by using the Expected Family Contribution (EFC)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> figures under the Federal Need Analysis formula, be determined to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have special needs. Those commenters who responded to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary's request for how to define significant number  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggested either that 66 percent of total enrollment be used, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that would be consistent with the mitigating circumstances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> threshold for appealing determinations of excessive cohort  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> default rates, or that percentages of enrollment, for example  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> five percent, 10 percent, or 20 percent, be used as thresholds,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> depending on the number of students.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

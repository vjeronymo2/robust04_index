			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of Austrian Foreign Minister Alois Mock's speech at </F> the Sudeten German Days in Nuremberg, date not given; statement  made by Czech President Vaclav Havel after his visit to Austria  on 29 March; and the "texts" of the invitations sent to Czech  Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus and Chairman of the Czech Social  Democratic Party Milos Zeman to take part in the Sudeten German  Days, dates not given: "Subject: The Sudeten German Days 21-22  May 1994"]    [Text]Speech by Austrian Foreign Minister Dr. Alois  Mock for the Sudeten German Days in Nuremberg and published in  the weekly SUDETENDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG: "Open to the Demands of the  Ethnic Minorities"    In my capacity as Austrian foreign minister, I greet most  cordially all the participants in the 45th Sudeten German Days!  I do so not only in view of our common Austrian past, but also  in appreciation of just how substantially the 160,000 Sudeten  Germans who found a new home in Austria after 1945, and their  descendants, have contributed to our country's recovery.    The Sudeten Germans' view of history still continues to be  clouded by memories of the iniquities suffered. In my opinion,  we must -- in this very issue -- take seriously the obligation  that we should come to terms honorably with the past, because  respect for the tens of thousands of innocent victims of the  expulsions enjoins us to do so.    In this connection, I am reminded of the great words of the  first Austrian federal chancellor after 1945, Leopold Figl, who  in his time suffered in Nazi concentration camps, but, despite  this, said: "Let us not forget, but let us forgive!"    I know that this point of view is also shared by the Sudeten  Germans. The "Charter of German Expellees" from 1950 contains  the following poignant sentences:    "We expelled Germans renounce revenge and retaliation. This  binding decision is sacred to us given the memory of the  infinite suffering that the last decade in particular (that is,  the period from 1940 to 1950) has brought to mankind."    During the period when the aforementioned charter was  formulated, we could still hope that Europe was finally  beginning another chapter in its history. Today we are  witnesses to how our continent is again afflicted with the crime  of mass resettlement.    Few people have expressed the association between the fate  of  the Sudeten Germans and some current events so clearly and  pointedly as Czech President Vaclav Havel, who, as we know,  feels that everyone who approves of the resettlement of the  German ethnic minority also in fact approves of the ethnic  cleansing in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    In any case, I am convinced that it would be disastrous if  Europe were again to make the same mistakes as it did in 1945.    In short, we must not let brute force gain ground unlawfully  in Europe again. We must not let someone -- for the second time  in less than 50 years in Europe -- in the services of the  cynical policy of "ethnic cleansing" commit acts that cannot be  prevented without, at the same time, leading to new acts of  injustice.    Moreover, we must -- with a thought for the fate of the  Sudeten Germans and the current events in southeastern Europe --  strive unconditionally to define functioning European national  and minority rights.    Austrian foreign policy -- like the expellees' unions -- has  long been striving for this.    Therefore, we ascribe extraordinary importance to the  decision made at the Vienna meeting involving the presidents and  prime ministers of the Council of Europe member countries, a  decision whereby the protection of minorities is to become the  subject of an appropriate general convention and of a  supplementary protocol to the European Convention on Human  Rights.    After 1945, the Sudeten Germans had to establish a  completely  new existence. They have done so in a remarkable manner.    In the majority of cases, however, they had probably already  given up hope of renewing contacts with their old homeland.  Thanks to the Iron Curtain and communist dictatorship, the past  seemed to be irrevocable.    It is absolutely understandable that today, when the Czech  Republic and Slovakia are again embarking on a road toward  democracy, a law-governed state, and respect for human rights,  the Sudeten Germans are asking whether the moment has also not  come when a new chapter in the history of relations with their  former homeland could be opened.    I -- at least -- have resolved that I will use every  suitable  opportunity to bring the demands of the Sudeten Germans to the  attention of our Czech and Slovak partners and that I will  emphasize our interest in ensuring that this issue is resolved  with a view to the future and in the spirit of good neighborly  relations.    In particular, I feel that it could be possible for the  Sudeten Germans to become involved to a greater extent in the  endeavors to develop the Czech Republic and Slovakia  economically.    As the first precedential cases have indicated, the Sudeten  Germans are well prepared for economic activity in their former  homeland. From a general point of view, these people -- thanks  to their intensely close ties to the country -- would probably  often be more willing to mobilize local resources than other  foreign investors (oriented, exclusively, toward profit).    The time is probably not yet ripe for more comprehensive  plans of this nature.    Despite that, I will continue to orient my efforts in that  direction. I will do so because I consider Austria's relations  with the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and our other Danubian  neighbors to be -- especially under the new conditions -- an  important point of our foreign policy.    With respect to those countries, we now have the  opportunity to implement extensive practical cooperation. Not  only between governments, parliaments, local representative  offices, professional organizations, special-interest groups,  and political parties, but also internationally, on foreign and  defense policy as well as the economy, culture, and  environmental protection.    I am convinced that the Sudeten Germans can help to  implement  such a policy.    I am also expressing this desire because I know what  genuinely unequivocal Europeans the expellees have become thanks  to their tragic fate.    The expellees' charter contained the following in August  1950: "We will support every effort oriented toward creating a  united Europe in which all peoples can live freely and without  fear."    Austria is now standing on the threshold of a united Europe.  If on 12 June the Austrian people decide in favor of our  country's membership of the European Union, Austria will be able  to take an active role in creating this the most significant  practical peaceful achievement in European history.    We will be able to take part in building a peaceful Europe,  a  Europe full of increasing mutuality. We will do this, because a  united Europe represents the best guarantee that the terrible  fate visited on the Sudeten Germans in 1945 will never be  repeated under its roof.  Statement Made by President Vaclav Havel Following his  Return From a State Visit to Austria on 29 March 1993    We are building a new democratic and law-governed state; we  are building a civic society. This state cannot be founded on  heresies, lies, or prejudices; this could regress tragically  upon us. The issue for me involves the cleanliness of our  political maturity. The ability to look our own past in the face  is also part of this.    The forced evacuation of millions of people, based on a  purely national principle -- that is, on the principle of  collective guilt -- is a morally defective act. Approving of it  means indirectly approving of the forced evacuation of Jews,  Tatars, Lithuanians, and other peoples from their homes; it also  means approving of the ethnic cleansing in Bosnia. It is  impossible to build a civic society on the endorsement of such  dangerous national acts. Just as national self-awareness cannot  be founded on forged manuscripts, it cannot be founded on any  other national prejudice. It is even necessary to say far more  unpleasant things about ourselves: For example, that, during  the First Republic, we did not manage to resolve the issue of  the minorities satisfactorily; that Slovakia was not always  treated well; that our resistance fighters did not enjoy too  much support among the public either during the war or under  communism, and people preferred to steer clear of them; that the  major part of the public voted for the communists; that we  allowed the suffering of the Jews to be kept quiet; that many  Czechs did not stand up for them during the war; and that, after  the Munich diktat, many Czechs and Czech organizations descended  into the most shameful anti-Semitism.    We are no worse than others; but we are no better. In my  opinion, it is the duty of a president to point out these  unpopular things. We are obliged to tell the truth about  ourselves, first and foremost, for our own sakes and that of our  descendants. It is surely possible to discuss, at the  appropriate level, the evacuation of the Sudeten Germans, but it  is even more important for us to discuss it without prejudice  among ourselves. I have spoken about this many times and always  here, at home. I remember the visit of President Weizsaecker  and his speech in the Vladislav Hall. However, if I am asked  abroad for my opinion, I give the same answer there as at home,  for I am not schizophrenic, saying one thing abroad and another  here.    Of course, I did not go to Austria so that I could discuss  this issue there, but, at the same time, I did not go there to  avoid unpleasant questions. Incidentally, in my statements, the  moral condemnation of the evacuation was completely in the shade  of my interpretation of why the legal aspect of this issue is  closed and unchangeable for us and why no legal consequences can  arise from a moral judgment. I think that I explained this more  thoroughly than many of my critics here.    The fact that my critics condemned my statements without  knowing them testifies to the very weak political culture in our  country. Understandably, the Office of the President has -- from  the first moment -- kept a precise record of everything that I  have said; however, no one has called and asked for a copy of  what I said. This affirms that my critics are not interested in  the facts, but only in muddying the waters and in fawning to  those who, after a taboo lasting decades, find it difficult to  come to terms with certain things. No government representative  or representative of the ruling coalition has made it clear to  me in our numerous meetings that he does not share my view on  this matter. Therefore, I perceive the statements of some  opposition officials as an attempt to drive a wedge between  myself and the ruling coalition. However, they will not succeed  in this. And something else: It does not surprise me that it  is the left that is defending the evacuation so robustly.  Collectivism is close to it and, since communist collectivism  has collapsed, it obviously needs national collectivism as a  replacement, dividing nations into the guilty and the innocent.    However, in the elections, our citizens cast their votes  for the ideal of a civic society in which each individual is  responsible for his own acts and they cast their votes for  parties that defend the inviolability of private ownership and  all civil rights. Of course, following this path also means  knowing how to admit that we did not always manage to govern  ourselves by these principles.    The evacuation is a bygone act of a democratic government,  an  act confirmed by the victorious powers, an act legally valid and  unchangeable. We are trying with difficulty to correct some of  the wrongs of communism, but we cannot and will not rectify past  history and thus commit new wrongs. That would be absurd. This  absolutely unequivocal stance, however, does not relieve us of  the obligation to tell -- in our own interest -- the complete  truth about our history, albeit unpleasant and unpopular, and to  admit that even a democratic government was capable of  succumbing to the Stalinist way of thinking and thus of  preparing for the rise of Stalinism. This is a matter for our  spiritual and moral wellbeing. The strength of our republic  will not lie in avoiding the truth, but in the will to recognize  it.  Invitation to Vaclav Klaus (as Chairman of the Civic  Democratic Party) To Take Part in the Sudeten German Days in  Nuremberg This Weekend    Esteemed Mr. Chairman,    The proposal for a Sudeten German-Czech dialogue, which is  also supported by many important German politicians of all  persuasions, is indeed intended to overcome the barriers of the  past and to seek a solution to the problems and a path toward a  positive future.    As a sign of our desire to meet each other half way and seek  a new beginning in relations between Czechs and Germans from  Bohemia, Moravia, and Silesia, we would like cordially to invite  you and other representatives from your party to this year's  principal meeting of the Sudeten Germans at the Sudeten German  Days 1994 in Nuremberg on the Whitsuntide weekend.    We would be pleased to welcome you among us. The enclosed  honorary passes contain information on the most important events  and points on the agenda of these Sudeten German Days, whose  course and "Aussagen" [message] should promote a peaceful and  conciliatory future.    I repeat my invitation and remain, with friendly greetings,    Yours,    Franz Neubauer.  The Letter From Representatives of the Sudeten German  Council to the Chairman of the Czech Social Democratic Party;  the Chairmen of the Other Political Parties Also Received a  Similar Letter    Esteemed Mr. Chairman,    The Sudeten German issue is constantly being aired and  discussed in the Czech media. Such discussions -- associated  with assumptions and fear -- are also being conducted among the  people themselves.    This indicates that Sudeten German issues are indeed a  problem that has still not been resolved so that it is possible  to guarantee the further calm and successful development of the  Czech Republic and of its relations with Germany.    The Sudeten Germans have long and repeatedly proposed and  offered a Sudeten German-Czech dialogue, because only a dialogue  begun without bias and accusation will overcome the prejudices,  eradicate the misunderstandings, and bring the problems closer  to a solution.    On account of many misunderstandings, we point out once  again  that the Sudeten German Council explained a long time ago that,  for it, the issue of the borders has never come up. This means  that all the models for a solution under discussion must be  considered within the Czech Republic.    While this dialogue was begun some time ago on a lower  platform and among people, it is still being rejected, as  previously, in the political sphere. This does not only meet  with incomprehension among us Sudeten Germans, but also among  the faraway German and Austrian political circles.    Therefore, we invite you to participate in an extensive  Czech- Sudeten German dialogue without bias! At the same time,  we are convinced that you also see the need for such a dialogue  to improve German-Czech relations. It would please us very much  if you would accept our invitation to the talks.    It would certainly be meaningful if this dialogue could  begin  soon.    We suggest that the dialogue be preceded first by  lower-level  talks between representatives from the democratic parties in the  Czech National Council and representatives from the Sudeten  German Council aimed at reaching agreement on the participants,  subjects, and dates for the dialogue.    We look forward to your timely point of view and remain,  with  cordial greetings,    Franz Neubauer, Volkmar Gabert, Herbert Werner, and Heinz  Kraus.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Lev Frolov] </F>   [Text] St. Petersburg April 19 TASS -- Turkmenia is an  attraction to foreign investment. Assurances for favorable  opportunities for foreign investment were made by Rashit  Kodyrov, chief of the department for work with international  financial organisations and banks at the Turkmenian Cabinet of  Ministers. He spoke on Tuesday at a briefing in St. Petersburg  during an annual meeting of the board of governors of the  European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.    Turkmenia is a major attraction to foreign investment and  capital, Kodyrov said. The purpose of investment is the  implementation of priority projects in oil and gas extraction,  transport infrastructure, telecommunications, the agrarian  sector. This work is preceded by international tenders that  proved their commercial expedience and attractiveness on the  example of the development of deposits on the Caspian shelf and  in Kotu-Tepe. Jointly with large petrochemical firms Amoco,  Shell, Chevron and others, joint ventures have been formed that  intend to invest up to $100 million into the development of  deposits.    Much interest was shown in a report about plans for a gas  pipeline to stretch from Turkmenia to Europe via Iran and  Turkey. The volume of the deliveries of natural gas through that  pipeline will be 25,000 million cubic meters a year. The  Turkmenian government plans the construction of a railway to the  border with Iran, of the last section of the Transasian line and  of a number of highways.    Experts believe that the Turkmenian programme "Ten Years of  Prosperity" opens broad opportunities for investment to the  European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and to other  international financial institutions. The bank, specifically,  intends to invest into the projects for the reconstruction of  the port of Krasnovodsk, facilities of the textile industry, for  the development of the hotel business in Ashkhabad [Ashgabat]  and in other cities.</p>

"I think it was a victory for our country's security,"  Defense Minister Werner Fasslabend (Austrian People's Party)  told DIE PRESSE on Tuesday evening [11 January]. Effective 1  January 1994, the duration of alternative national service will  be 11 months. A further extension to 12 months could come into  force beginning 1 January 1995, if the number of applications  for alternative service between 1 May and 31 October 1994  exceeds 3,000.    The new regulation will remain in force until the end of  1995. Unless a further regulation is agreed before the end of  1995, both the board examining reasons of conscience and the  eight-month period of alternative service will be reintroduced.  This is the compromise agreed upon yesterday by Fasslabend and  Interior Minister Franz Loeschnak (Social Democratic Party of  Austria), after consultations with their respective party  chairmen. Fasslabend said: "Our patience did pay off. I think  it is important that the government has found a solution."  Interior Minister Loeschnak said that he did not expect an  extension to 12 months.</p>

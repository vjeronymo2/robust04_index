It is not certain that  they will take place on the date scheduled, however, because  Yerevan and Baku have not yet made a final decision.    Tofik Abbasov, head of the Azerbaijan presidential apparatus  press service, told SEGODNYA's correspondent that the meeting  depends on whether the expert commission formed with  representatives of Russian, Armenian, and Azerbaijan Foreign  Ministries will complete its work. Furthermore, Mr. Abbasov  noted that the president will come to the meeting if he has the  time. Baku, however, welcomes Russia's initiative and will soon  make its final decision known.    Yerevan's attitude to the scheduled Moscow meeting is  essentially the same. The press service of the Armenian  presidential apparatus told SEGODNYA's correspondent that "this  question will be decided in the very near future."    Such a position by Yerevan and Baku suggests that the  meeting  between presidents Ter-Petrosyan and Aliyev set for 25 January  may not take place or may be moved to a later date.    At present both warring sides understand the impossibility  of  resolving the Karabakh conflict militarily. The upcoming  meeting, however, even if it does take place, will be hardly  capable of putting an end to the Karabakh issue because Baku  will never agree to the loss of part of its territory, while the  self-proclaimed Nagorno-Karabakh Republic will not want to lose  its unrecognized independence. At present there is no  compromise option that would suit both sides. Therefore,  chances are that no peace agreement will be concluded between  Armenia and Azerbaijan any time soon.</p>

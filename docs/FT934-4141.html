			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / Spending plans by Commission upset ministers The European Commission yesterday approved spending of nearly Ecu124bn (Pounds 165bn) on public works programmes over the next six years, including a new plan to float 'Brussels bonds' to help to finance the projects. Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, will present the plans to the European summit on Friday, as part of his White Paper on employment and growth, despite reservations among European finance ministers who were meeting in Brussels last night. Several ministers complained that Mr Delors had failed to produce a copy of the White Paper; German officials expressed opposition to the notion of new public borrowing to support infrastructure spending. 'It goes against our policy of budgetary restraint,' said one Bonn official. But Mr Edmond Alphandery, French finance minister, offered support for the idea of additional finance to cover big road, rail, telecommunications and environmental projects. It remained unclear how finance ministers intend to integrate Mr Delors's own non-binding White Paper with the legally binding but diluted version of the macro-economic guidelines for the European Union, which were being debated last night. One official spoke of a 'power struggle' between the Commission and the finance ministers who tend to look more to national rather than to pan-European interests. The Commission said yesterday that only Ecu7bn of the proposed annual spending of Ecu20.6bn was new money. The rest has already been earmarked in the budgetary guidelines approved last December at the European summit in Edinburgh or through the European Investment Bank. The Commission has identified trans-European network projects costing about Ecu135bn. Officials believe these would improve European competitiveness by strengthening the single market, but fear they could be delayed because private banks and governments could object to the cost. At the special session of the Commission yesterday, some members were said to have criticised selective aspects of the White Paper which calls for reforms in the labour market to make it easier to hire people, an effective freeze on wages, and budget discipline.  -----------------------------------------------      THE THREE-CORNERED EMPLOYMENT DEBATE  -----------------------------------------------                 MR ACTIVIST                Padraig Flynn         Comissioner for Social Affairs  -----------------------------------------------                MR NEW SOCIETY                Jacques Delors          President of the Commission  -----------------------------------------------                  MR ORTHODOX            Henning Christophersen          Commissioner for the Economy  -----------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Major adopts tougher style on his soap box MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday predicted a 'nightmare on Kinnock Street' for British families under a Labour government - marking the adoption of a tougher election campaigning style. He told 1,000 Tories at a rally in Birmingham: 'Don't believe for a second that it doesn't matter who wins. It matters desperately. It matters to Britain and it matters to you.' Mr Major sharpened his attack on Mr Neil Kinnock, saying the Labour leader was unfit to protect Britain's interests on defence and in Europe. 'You can't go back into the conference chamber and say: 'Sorry, boyo, I got it wrong.' ' He balanced the negative picture of five years of Labour with his own vision for Britain, and urged people to take pride in the achievements of the 1980s under the leadership of Mrs Margaret Thatcher. Mr Major's new-found aggression showed as he pledged to 'take the gloves off' in proclaiming the Tory record on education and the National Health Service. The harder approach was apparent earlier when he took to his soap box on the streets of Cheltenham to underline his warning that the choice at the election was crucial. Party aides emphasised that the decision to use the soap box was Mr Major's own, and he later confirmed that it was reminiscent of his early years in politics in Brixton, south London. 'It's fashionable to say that for security and other reasons you can't get up on a soap box, but I think you have to and I'm going to do it,' Mr Major said. This further change of tactic followed renewed criticism of a lack-lustre Tory campaign. At the rally Mr Major contrasted the effects on an ordinary family of five years of Labour with a further Tory term. He highlighted the differences on inflation, taxes, choice in schools and wider home ownership. In Cheltenham Mr Major harangued a largely docile crowd and engaged in some badinage with the few hecklers. When someone shouted 'Rubbish]' to his assertion that Labour would cost the average taxpayer an extra Pounds 1,250 a year, he replied: 'Rubbish promises, but the taxes would be real enough.' His impromptu performance was effective, but one or two lines may still need polishing. 'Where was he during the last Labour government?' Mr Major asked about a heckler who queried his estimate of higher taxes under Labour. 'In work]' came the response from another voice in the crowd.</p>

The government and 3-80 Northern Front  commissions continue to work on establishing programs to  reintegrate the demobilized men into civilian society.  Government Minister Alfredo Mendieta said that the group will  be fully disarmed by 8 April.    The government commission headed by Minister Mendieta and  members of the 3-80 Front met and decided to postpone the  disarmament until next week.    [Begin Mendieta recording, in progress] ...we decided not to  implement the disarmament today and to postpone it until next  week. Meanwhile, we will continue the reintegration process.  Everything is normal and as planned. We hope that there will  be no major delays and that this process will irreversibly  progress. [end recording]    There will be a number of meetings to assess the work of the  commissions and the programs to reintegrate the 3-80 Northern  Front. Minister Mendieta said that members of this group are  willing to accept loans to buy land. The government, he added,  will offer them financing and advice. [passage omitted]</p>

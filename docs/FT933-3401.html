			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Provision holds Dalgety back DALGETY, the food and agriculture group, reported pre-tax profits up slightly, from Pounds 111.6m to Pounds 112.2m, for the year to June 30, after making an exceptional provision of Pounds 9m to cover claims associated with the sale of an insurance business. Operating profits rose 6 per cent to Pounds 130.4m on increased sales of Pounds 4.5bn (Pounds 4bn). A strong performance from the agricultural supplies operation and food distribution offset a disappointing result from food ingredients. The group is having to provide Pounds 9m for insurance losses incurred a decade ago by Bain Clarkson, known as Clarkson Puckle when it was a subsidiary of Gill and Duffus, the trading group, acquired by Dalgety. Clarkson was involved in reinsurance cover for US companies against claims for environmental damage. The scale of the liabilities were not known when Dalgety sold the insurance company to Inchcape in 1987. Mr Richard Clothier, chief executive, said the payment closed the matter by extricating the group from any possible litigation. Following its recent announcement that it was buying two businesses from Unigate, the food and distribution group, for Pounds 15.7m, Mr Clothier said he expected to make further infill acquisitions. But he warned against speculation that the group was about to make a big acquisition in Europe. 'We are not going to be rushed into paying silly prices.' Food distribution increased operating profits by 27 per cent to Pounds 15.2m on the back of strong volume growth in both the McDonalds and National Accounts divisions. An increase in volumes of consumer foods helped the foods division report a 10 per cent increase to Pounds 65.7m. Agribusiness increased its market share and cut costs to enable it to increase profits by 14 per cent to Pounds 32.1m. However, operating profits from food ingredients fell 24 per cent to Pounds 17.4m, mainly because of the sale of Modern Maid and Federal Bakeries and the temporary closure of a plant. Net borrowings of Pounds 49m reflected gearing of 12 per cent. Earnings per share fell to 35.7p (36.3p), although excluding exceptional items they rose to 39.4p (38.6p). The final dividend is raised to 12.65p (12p) giving an increased total of 20.5p (19.5p). COMMENT After rationalising its businesses and strengthening its balance sheet, Dalgety looks well positioned for further growth. A 26 per cent increase in capital investment to Pounds 81m and a tough cost-cutting programme flowed through in three of the four divisions which increased operating profits. The big acquisition continues to prove elusive. Most promising areas in Europe are snacks and pet foods, but both are dominated by larger players, which may be why management is so keen to dampen expectations. With forecast annual pre-tax profits of Pounds 130m the shares are on a prospective multiple of 13. It may not be a sparkling performer but given the reliability of earnings the shares still look attractive.</p>

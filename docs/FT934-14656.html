			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Observer: Post haste? A year to the day since EC president Jacques Delors offered employment at a wage of Ecu200,000 to anyone who could come up with a one-page explanation of how subsidiarity might work, Observer discovers that no adjudication has taken place. The impossibility of the undertaking is undoubtedly underlined by Delors' spokesman having personally received just two attempts. 'It was no doubt taken as the plaisanterie it was,' he harrumphs. But the silence from Brussels has disappointed one, prima facie excellently qualified reader. Victor Ross, retired chairman of Reader's Digest, has been bombarding Delors' office with requests about the progress of his submission. Answer comes there none. He does admit, however, that delegation of responsibility for the acknowledgment of solicited mail below a certain level of competence was perhaps an aspect of subsidiarity he should have considered in his own entry.</p>

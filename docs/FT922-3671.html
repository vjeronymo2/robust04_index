			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Hongkong Bank shares hit heavy selling pressure THE SHARE price of Hongkong and Shanghai Bank came under heavy selling pressure yesterday as arbitrageurs quit their holdings, analysts said. At the same time, the shareholders of the bank approved resolutions at an extraordinary general meeting which gave management the authority to make its share and cash bid for Midland Bank. The meeting - which lasted 15 minutes and at which no questions were asked - also revoked the board's right to restrict individual shareholders to owning no more than 1 per cent of the bank. The price of HSBC Holdings fell to a low of HKDollars 44 yesterday before recovering slightly to close at HKDollars 44.75 - HKDollars 2 below Monday's level. On the Hong Kong closing price, the Hongkong Bank's offer for Midland valued each share at 440p, down from the 471p valuation a week ago when 60p cash was injected into the bid to make it more attractive to UK institutional shareholders. Analysts said the weakness in Hongkong Bank and Midland's share price reflected traders selling the stocks because a higher bid from Lloyds for Midland did not materialise. Holders of HSBC were betting on it withdrawing in the face of a higher Lloyds offer for Midland. Those who may want to buy HSBC, because they manage funds linked to the FT-SE Share Index or the FT All Share index, were unable to until the merger was consummated, analysts said. 'Investors who will be compelled to buy HSBC can't do so for two weeks and for an arbitrageur that's too long,' said Ms Laura Grenning, banking analyst at Smith New Court. Mr William Purves, Hongkong Bank's chairman, speaking after the extraordinary general meeting, said it was difficult to say why the bank's share price fell, though he thought the weakness would be short-term. 'Maybe there is some arbitrage going on, a little profit-taking. Some say disappointed people in London are selling,' he said.</p>

			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / Aid for Srebrenica after seven-month siege: Laura Silber arrives with the UN convoy bringing relief to a Moslem stronghold in Bosnia WOMEN and children streamed down the hills in tears at the weekend as a United Nations relief convoy brought the first outside help to the Moslem stronghold of Srebrenica since the war erupted in Bosnia-Hercegovina in April. It brought food and clothing to 70,000 people surviving on maize, oats, and potatoes in the ruins. 'We didn't dare to believe the Serbs would let you come here. Thank God,' said 45-year-old Mrs Sabra Hasanovic. Serb forces for seven months have besieged Srebrenica. As the convoy crossed lines in Serb-held Bratunac, most Serbs spat and swore at the passing white UN vehicles. Some black-clad women threw flowers. As the convoy crossed the 2,000-yard no-man's-land into Srebrenica, children, many barefoot, and women dressed in dimije, baggy Turkish-style trousers, crowded the streets and jammed sagging balconies to welcome the UN. The Ukrainian UN armoured personnel carriers were forced to bulldoze a Moslem barricade of burned-out buses to enter the town, nestled in the mountains. Local officials said the population of 30,000 had more than doubled, as Moslem refugees fled 'ethnic cleansing' by Serb forces elsewhere in eastern Bosnia. Moslem women told harrowing tales of treks to sanctuary in the besieged town. 'My father-in-law hanged himself when he saw the Serbs had set fire to his house. His wife dropped dead from the shock. Now I must take care of my two children,' said Mrs Mera Kandjatorovic. Potatoes boiled on a wood-burning stove in a kitchen she and five other refugees now call home. 'We've covered the windows with plastic bags, but it will soon be cold.' People have crowded into any rooms which have escaped destruction. Stacks of wood piled outside every house are the only defence against the harsh winter. Maize has replaced currency, but there is little to buy. The women and their thin children are terrified and hungry but the Bosnian fighters are in good spirits. They vow to defend the town, whose centre was burned out by Serbs when they briefly held it in April. Mr Resup Naseroric, a local commander, said he did not hate his Serbian neighbours. 'We are not fighting a jihad (holy war), but the Serbian side is forcing us into one. We don't want it to be a religious war because there are also people of Serbian nationality on our territory.' Ironically, Mr Naseroric, 25, spent 4 1/2 years as a personal bodyguard of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, widely seen as most responsible for the war in Bosnia. Fighters cajoled the town's first visitors into giving them cigarettes while others helped UN soldiers unload the 137 tonnes of flour, beans and sugar. Doctors at Srebrenica hospital were aghast that the convoy brought no medicine. 'We have nothing. No medicine, no pain-killers,' complained Mr Aziz Husic, one of five local doctors caring for 70 wounded. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) on Saturday said medicines would be included on the next convoy, which could be as soon as next week. But the UNHCR managed to reach Srebrenica only after months of negotiations and a four-day stand-off at Bosnia's frontier with Serbia. As winter sets in, Srebrenica waits for the siege to end. Mrs Hajruda Hrustic said: 'This food will help. But it's not enough and maybe you will never be allowed here again. Help us to leave this place, or we will starve to death.' Heavy fighting between Croat and Serb forces in north Bosnia was reported yesterday near Loncari village, by a corridor linking Serb-held regions in Croatia with Serbia, Reuter reports from Sarajevo. A ceasefire between the two rivals was due to come into effect hours later.</p>

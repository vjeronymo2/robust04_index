			<p>921027 FT  27 OCT 92 / International Company News: Lower interest rates boost Quebecor QUEBECOR Printing, North America's second-largest commercial printer, was helped by rising efficiency, lower interest costs and lower taxes to a 71 per cent gain in net profit for the first nine months of 1992. The group, controlled by Quebecor, the Montreal-based publisher, posted earnings of Dollars 36m, or 74 cents a share, against Dollars 21m, or 52 cents, a year earlier on revenues of Dollars 1.05bn, compared with Dollars 998m. Third-quarter net profit was Dollars 16.9m, or 32 cents a share, against Dollars 11.4m, or 29 cents, a year earlier on revenues of Dollars 360m, up from Dollars 346m. The company made one acquisition during the quarter. The group operates in all major sectors of commercial printing from inserts and directories to bank notes. With acquisition of the former Maxwell Graphics two years ago, two-thirds of its business is in the US. Bramalea, the property group controlled by the Bronfman family of Toronto, has another three weeks to modify its five-year restructuring plan to satisfy senior debenture holders. A six-hour meeting in Toronto last week with the holders of CDollars 525m (USDollars 423.30m) of debentures was adjourned to November 19. The restructuring is designed to deal with the company's total debt of more than CDollars 4bn.</p>

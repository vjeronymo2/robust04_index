			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Business Travel: Shuttling into Kennedy - The increase of JFK/Heathrow flights From this summer, British Airways will no longer offer the most frequent service between London's Heathrow and New York's John F Kennedy airports. Within a month, American Airlines is to increase its daily flights on the route from four to six, overtaking BA's five. Of those BA flights, only three are by standard aircraft; the others are Pounds 5,000-a-seat Concorde trips. And within two weeks of American's move, its great rival, United Airlines, will increase its daily Heathrow-JFK flights from three to four. Other significant carriers on the route are Virgin Atlantic, with a twice-daily service, and Kuwait Airways and Air India, with one each. That makes 19 flights a day between the two airports. Moreover, BA and Virgin have daily flights to Newark airport, closer to Manhattan than JFK but in the neighbouring state of New Jersey. The elevation of the Heathrow-New York route to the status of business shuttle is a result mainly of the economic recovery, say American and United. Frequency of service appeals to business travellers more than to tourists. Business executives are more likely to fly on an airline that has a lot of flights: if the meeting goes on an extra half hour, the executive knows there will be another flight home soon. For United, the decision to emphasise frequency of service, rather than size of aircraft, has led them to employ one of the smallest aircraft available for such a journey. 'The route consists largely of point-to-point traffic and we decided that the best method was to use the smaller Boeing 767-200s, flying more frequently,' according to a United spokesman. United's early flight from London - at 0755 the first of the day to JFK - is especially popular among business travellers, and has tempted American to introduce its own early flight at 0830. The business traveller is an extraordinarily lucrative customer to secure. The normal business class return fare between London and New York is about Pounds 2,200, almost 10 times the cheapest Apex economy fare. Because of the congestion at Heathrow, an airline cannot easily secure additional take-off slots. American Airlines is, therefore, sacrificing services to tourist-type destinations, such as Los Angeles and Miami, to increase its Heathrow-JFK frequency. American is, however, not increasing its daily flights from other European cities such as Paris, Brussels, Zurich - where economic recovery is yet to make itself strongly felt. BA says it is unworried by the increasing competition on flights to JFK. It still considers the route 'blue chip'. But BA says that, since it took a stake in USAir, it has been keen to link transatlantic passengers with USAir's huge domestic network. That means it is adding flights to large USAir hub cities, such as Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Charlotte, and Baltimore. BA can also take some comfort from the fact that the rise in frequencies does not mean quite as sharp an increase in the number of available seats. BA flies the route with 380-seat Boeing 747s. Most of the US-owned aircraft, on the other hand, are the smaller Boeing 767s, which carry only between between 164 and 214 passengers, or McDonnell Douglas MD-11s, carrying 271 people. Moreover, passengers in a hurry are also likely to factor into their choice the fact that the 767s take about 20 minutes longer than the MD-11s and 747s.</p>

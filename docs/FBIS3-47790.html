			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 19 KYODO -- A major Vietnamese trade  exposition opened in Tokyo on Wednesday [19 January] with Hanoi  officials expressing hope for vastly increased exports to Japan  into the future.    "Japan is a very important market for our exports," said  Duong Ky Anh, a senior official of the Vietnam Chamber of  Commerce and Industry, which cosponsored the exposition along  with the Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO). Duong said  he hoped the exposition and other events like it to follow will  help to vastly increase Vietnam's exports to Japan, the  country's largest export market.    According to Japanese Finance Ministry figures, Vietnam's  exports to Japan registered 870 million dollars in 1992 compared  with 196 million dollars in 1988.    Duong estimated his country's exports to Japan rocketed up  to  1.2 billion dollars in 1993. He expressed hope the figure will  rise as high as 1.6 billion dollars in 1994.    The exposition, supported by both the Japanese and  Vietnamese  Governments, is the first of its kind ever held in Japan  focusing on Vietnamese goods. It lasts until January 27 and  precedes the holding of a major Japanese industrial product  trade fair in Hanoi next March.    Representatives from 25 Vietnamese companies are exhibiting  such potential export items as shrimp, coffee, handicrafts,  furniture and clothing.    Duong said Vietnam wants in 1994 to double the amount earned  last year when mineral fuels, mostly crude oil, made up over  half of the value of Vietnam's exports to Japan. He said  Vietnam anticipates increasing the value of marine products  exported to Japan from the 350 million dollars earned in 1993 to  500 million dollars in 1994.    Exports to Japan of marine products, including frozen  shrimp,  fish, and squid, have already almost doubled over 1992.    Duong called for more Japanese investment in Vietnam,  especially in infrastructure. He said there is a particular  need for equipment from Japan that can be used to improve the  quality of Vietnamese products for export.    The official also said his country must endeavor to attract  greater numbers of Japanese tourists to earn badly needed hard  currency.    Assessing the "privileges and shortcomings" in Vietnam's  trade relationship with Japan, Duong said the privileges include  their relative geographical proximity and their dramatically  improved political ties. He said the shortcomings include  problems with the quality of processed Vietnamese products.    "To some extent we cannot meet the strict requirements of  this market," he said. "We have to improve our quality  drastically, otherwise we cannot enter."    Duong pointed to "keen competition" from other countries  like  China, Thailand and Indonesia which export similar products.</p>

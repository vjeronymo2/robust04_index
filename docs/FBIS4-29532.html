			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Second of a two-part feature article by Chong Pyong-chin: </F> "Simulated Scenario: Dialogue or War?"]    [Excerpts] Rapid progress is being made in resolving the  North Korean nuclear issue. The North Korean nuclear issue has  entered a totally new phase as North Korea and the United States  are moving toward an agreement on dialogue with "special envoy  Jimmy Carter" as a mediator. [passage omitted]    The United States expressed its willingness to suspend  efforts for UN sanctions on North Korea and to hold the third  round of talks if North Korea returns to its previous status; if  it returns to the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and  does not withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.  Therefore, it seems that if North Korea accepts the U.S.  proposal, the North Korean nuclear issue will "run the course of  dialogue" as opposed to the "accelerating sanctions" situation  that prevailed two days ago. [passage omitted]    Accordingly, how North Korea will prove its nuclear  transparency and to what extent the United States will improve  its relations with North Korea are expected to be focused in the  discussions at the third round of North Korea-U.S. talks, if  they are held.    With regard to the verification of North Korea's nuclear  transparency, the United States will demand special inspections  [tukpyol sachal kkaji] by the IAEA, and North Korea will insist  that the nuclear development will naturally be frozen as a  result of the abolition of its existing nuclear facilities and  by the U.S. assistance in the light-water reactor system. This  difference in opinion between North Korea and the United States  will probably cause another tug-of-war. It is expected,  however, that a clue to solving the problem will be found in the  agreement between Jimmy Carter and President Kim Il-song on  "building mutual trust".    The extent to which the United States will proceed with  discussions on improving its relations with North Korea will  totally depend on North Korea's attitude. The United States has  said that it will improve relations with North Korea to a  considerable extent if North Korea proves its "100 percent  innocence" in regard to the development and possession of  nuclear weapons. The United States and our government have  completed coordination on this position. [passage omitted]    The ROK and the United States have agreed that "when the  third round of North Korea-U.S. talks is held, South-North  dialogue for denuclearizing the Korean peninsula should be held,  and this means South-North bilateral inspections." This  reflects our position that North Korea's nuclear transparency  must be verified, not only by the IAEA, but also by our  government. It is the line drawn by the policy of our  government, which is one of the parties most directly concerned  with the North Korean nuclear issue, but has kept away from  negotiations on the issue, and it is its due demand. [passage  omitted]    We should also pay attention to the possibility that, as the  supply of light-water reactors require a long time, several  years, and a budget of several trillion won, North Korea will  demand the fourth and fifth rounds of North Korea-U.S. talks  while insisting on "freezing its nuclear development after the  supply of light-water reactors." In preparation for this  possible situation, the ROK and the United States are likely to  put on hold [yuye] the draft resolution on UN sanctions on North  Korea, rather than abolish it. The policy of "dialogue for  sanctions and sanctions for dialogue" will inevitably be the  basic principle that the ROK and the United States should adhere  to until the North Korean nuclear issue is completely resolved.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 5 April (MTI) -- This year's goods  transport protocol was signed in Budapest today by Hungarian  Minister of International Economic Relations Bela Kadar and his  Ukrainian counterpart Oleh Slyepichev.    The ministers told the press that two-way trade was  developing dynamically, despite a fall in production and export  in both countries. Last year the trade turnover totalled $300  million, of which Hungarian export amounted to $159 million, and  import to $141 million. Ukraine is the 14th biggest trade  partner of Hungary.    Kadar and Slyepichev said the organizational framework for  bilateral links had been established. To date, about 300  Hungarian- Ukrainian joint ventures have been set up. In a move  to promote their operation, the two countries are likely to sign  an investment protection agreement soon.    The two ministers voiced their wish to strengthen  cooperation  between Hungary, Ukraine, and Slovakia, and said the three  states will seek help from the European Bank for Reconstruction  and Development to finance projects in the region.    The Ukrainian minister thanked Hungary for a $1 million loan  for the reconstruction of the Beregszasz hospital. The loan is  to be repaid through goods deliveries.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Feb 18 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Russia should  tell the Bosnian Serbs to withdraw all their heavy weaponry from  the whole of Bosnia-Herzegovina and not just Sarajevo, Malaysian  Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamed said today.    Sarajevo is [word indistinct] everything; the whole of  Bosnia  should be liberated from the Serb (forces) and they should  withdraw all their weapons, said the prime minister.    This was to allow the Bosnians to participate in  negotiations  without being threatened, he added.    He was responding to reporters' questions about a possible  Serbo compliance with an ultimatum by the North Atlantic Treaty  Organisation (NATO) fo the withdrawal of heavy guns around  Sarajevo to help bring about a comprehensive solution to the  Balkan conflict.    Russia was reported to have asked the Bosnian Serbs to  comply  with the NATO ultimatum.    Dr. Mahathir was also asked about the likely impact of  imminent U.S. trade sanctions against Japan following the  failure by both countries to reach a trade agreement.    He said the government was studying it first, at the moment,  it was not sure what the effects would be.    But, he said: we agree that while we should open th market  for everybody there should not be any numerical quota of imports  by anybody... You buy what you think is fair and what you need,  not on the basis of quota.    As to the possible effects of the U.S.-Japan trade impasse  on  the recently concluded Uruguay Round of multilateral trade  negotiations and the General Agreemant on Tariffs and Trade, Dr.  Mahathir said the US had withdrawn certain items from what they  had agreed to in the Uruguay Round.    This is not a good omen... What is to stop other people from  withdrawing items, then there would be no Uruguay Round, no GATT  agreement, he added.</p>

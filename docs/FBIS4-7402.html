			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Suryansyah: "Not Looking for Influence"] </F>   [Text] Islamic boarding schools have been put to the test  for a long time. The strength of these "institutions" lies not  only in the area of education. Their influence has spread into  the political arena as well. Islamic boarding schools have  actually been influential since before the revolution. In fact,  when there were kingdoms, Muslim scholars and Islamic boarding  schools formed a clique which controlled royal actions and  policies. For example, King Amangkurat I once killed about 6,000  Muslim scholars in front of his people because they opposed his  policies.    During the Old Order, an Islamic-oriented organization was  part of almost every political party. For example, the Jam'iyyah  Muslimin (JAMUS) was part of the PNI [Indonesian National Party].    These tendencies went quite far. The Old Order embraced the  Islamic masses in the Islamic boarding schools. Since that time  all Indonesian political forces have been racing, as it were, to  gain legitimacy through the Islamic masses. In other words, the  Islamic boarding schools, the basis of Islamic strength, have  been leading sources of support for votes and influence.    Is that true? The following is EDITOR's Usman Sosiawan's  interview with Lt. Gen. (Army) R. Hartono, ABRI's  social-political chief of staff. Hartono, former commander of  Military District Command V/Brawijaya and governor of the  National Defense Institute, is well known as a Madurese who is  close to the Islamic boarding schools. We recorded some of his  comments when we stopped him as he left a program on  provisioning held at Makostrad [Kostrad Command Headquarters] on  Friday 4 March.    [Sosiawan] What is your response to the Army chief of  staff's  visit to several Islamic boarding schools?    [Hartono] It's normal. The Army chief of staff is also the  territorial developer. It's only natural for him to go there, to  approach them, and to introduce himself.    [Sosiawan] There isn't any political intent?    [Hartono] No. It's one of the principles behind ABRI's  territorial development.    [Sosiawan] Is it true that the Islamic boarding schools are  considered of great potential importance for the support of  political power?    [Hartono] Wait a minute. If you mean Islamic boarding  schools  in the sense of the word Islamic and if we start from the  meanings of faith and devotion, they certainly are going to talk  about state and national problems. In that case, what do you  call it, political or what? It's political too. But we must  remember that its involvement in politics is in fact determined  by individual qualities, including the quality of those  institutions themselves.    [Sosiawan] How far does their involvement normally go?    [Hartono] Well, they have education from, let's say as we  generally understand it, from kindergarten to college. Clearly  we're not speaking to their involvement. But should we provide  them with an understanding of politics, which I think has to be  given to them in the Islamic boarding schools? I say we have to,  again referring to the faith and devotion that I mentioned  before. That means, you know, that they must think about  national and state problems.    [Sosiawan] There has been a tendency for some figures to  reach out for sympathy from the Islamic boarding schools. Your  comments?    [Hartono] Don't put it that way.    [Sosiawan] As an example, a number of ministers and even the  president attended the RMI [Robithotul Ma'ahidil Islamiyah]  meeting recently. What does that mean?    [Hartono] Don't make any connection between that and looking  for influence or sympathy. It's not the case. It's like the Army  chief of staff's recent visit to the provinces. As Army chief of  staff, let's say it's because he's relatively new, he certainly  has to visit and become acquainted with the provinces, including  the territorial development units within them.</p>

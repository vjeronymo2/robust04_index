			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PIER PRESSURE;  </P> <P> LIFEGUARDS: LEAPING 40 FEET FROM AN OCEANSIDE LANDMARK, THEN SWIMMING AROUND  IT, IS A TIME-HONORED TRADITION AND TEST OF FITNESS.  </P> <P> Two lean Oceanside lifeguards were delicately poised atop the citypier's narrow  railing, ready to jump into the churning water nearly 40 feet below.  </P> <P> An instant before they leaped, a fisherman suddenly dumped a whole bucket of  fish guts and blood into the briny, and Matt Stephens and Tom Buckner found  themselves following the slop down, dropping like two lead ingots.  </P> <P> "It was disgusting, I'll tell you that," Stephens muttered moments later.  </P> <P> Just another day in a time-honored tradition for Oceanside lifeguards who,  since the '50s, have made swimming around the 1,900-foot-long pier and  practice-jumping from the railing a ritual of skill.  </P> <P> Historically, it is part of lifeguard bonhomie, a splashy yet challenging way  to shed stress and stay toned for the deceptively strenuous job of saving lives  when seconds matter.  </P> <P> But, for the last four years, the jutting pier also has become the centerpiece  of a killer workout for city lifeguards who must be able to run one mile, slosh  quickly around the pier, then run another mile, all in less than 27 minutes.  </P> <P> The architect of this regimen is Stephens, the 30-year-old lifeguard captain  who wanted a to make sure that his force of 33 lifeguards never gets too  blubbered out to make a dashing rescue and have wind left to spare.  </P> <P> "It keeps you young, you're down here with 16 year olds, competing against  them," said Stephens. "It feels good to beat them on workouts."  </P> <P> He and Buckner, at 31, are the old men among the lifeguards whose average age  is 23.  </P> <P> These two veteran lifeguards probably pack more exertion into 27 minutes than  the average American male gets in a month, and, as their reward, Stephens and  Buckner have not a trace of beer bellies and are untouched by the natural law  of sagging flesh.  </P> <P> On this day, the bucket of fish guts aside, the swim around the pier is a  70-degree milk run, and the two emerge from the sea not even breathing hard.  "To us, that's just refreshing," said Stephens.  </P> <P> But it's rarely care free.  </P> <P> The water is fickle, sometimes so cold in the low 50s that many a young  lifeguard has come out shivering, the chest heaving so hard that lunch has been  unceremoniously lost on the beach.  </P> <P> That's not the only peril to keeping one's food down, and, Bucker said, "if  it's windy and choppy, it gets tough. You have to watch your breathing. If  there's chop, you get a mouthful of salt water."  </P> <P> Hidden demons of the deep, both large and small, occupy a lifeguard's  imagination as he gracefully strokes out and back, trying to concentrate on  making the trip in 12 to 15 minutes.  </P> <P> Lifeguards worry about getting a face full of jelly fish or startling a  stingray, with their poisonous, pencil-sized barbs.  </P> <P> But the last thing Stephens and Buckner ever want to see up close is a shark.  </P> <P> "Yeah, sharks. It's always in the back of your mind," said Stephens, his quiet  tone hinting at real fear.  </P> <P> Buckner, with one of his puckish observations, added, "Right after 'Jaws' came  out, they caught two of 'em." Not exactly what Stephens cared to hear.  </P> <P> Visions of unlikely dorsal fins and a big mouth full of crooked teeth seem to  concern the two men more than dropping themselves off the pier with such force  that they plunge 10 feet under the water.  </P> <P> Buckner drolly calls this feat "semi-exciting," but concedes that, after so  many times, "the jump's a piece of cake."  </P> <P> Leaping from the rail has little to do with braggadocio and everything to do  with practicing to rescue people who run into trouble near or below the pier.  </P> <P> Once, Stephens dropped into the ocean when an off-course sailboat drifted into  the pilings and snagged, endangering the boat's inexperienced occupants.  </P> <P> Some lifeguards circumnavigate the pier every day, providing an entertaining  show to the tourists and fishermen who watch in awe.  </P> <P> Stephane Borgnine, a waitress at a restaurant on the pier, sees the spectators  following the swimmers, who are alone or in groups, with their precision  movement along the glassy, green water.  </P> <P> "People watch, they're fascinated," said Borgnine, who is commonly called upon  to explain that the swimmers are training lifeguards.  </P> <P> Ray Duncan, the city's aquatics superintendent, is the generational link  between Stephens and Buckner and an earlier age of the lifeguard service, which  began in 1943.  </P> <P> As a young lifeguard back in the early '60s, Duncan learned to respect the  challenge of negotiating the waters at the pier, which is 1,900 feet long,  about 1,600 feet of that actually suspended over the ocean.  </P> <P> "The average person could not swim around the pier," he said, warning all but  the best swimmers not to attempt the course. "For a lifeguard, it's an enduring  swim, but not an extraordinary feat."  </P> <P> He called the lifeguards' run-swim-run drill, "a grueling test."  </P> <P> With lives at stake, that's exactly how Stephens wants it, and he will  understand but won't tolerate a lifeguard who is timid about taking that long  jump from the pier.  </P> <P> "The people who are afraid don't come back the next year, they find another  job," he said.  </P> <P> The marks of his 13 years of experience are visible on his feet, scarred and  calloused from wearing fins.  </P> <P> The fins, like the rigors of practice, are with a single objective in mind:  saving people.  </P> <P> In their time, Stephens and Buckner have lost count of how many people they  have pulled from the rip tides and the crashing surf off Oceanside.  </P> <P> "You stop counting," Stephens said, then, after a pause, added, "It's up there,  probably close to 1,000, maybe more."  </P> <P> A key to saving lives is that lifeguards usually know precious minutes ahead  that a neophyte, white-skinned swimmer is about to get in danger.  </P> <P> By the time a swimmer is flailing around and getting dunked, a lifeguard is  already racing down the beach.  </P> <P> The tip-off to trouble is watching as swimmers blithely drift toward the places  where lifeguards know a rip tide is waiting to carry a person out to the deeper  sea.  </P> <P> "There's no way they're going to know what the rip tide is about or how to get  out of it," said Buckner.  </P> <P> He, like the other lifeguards, has pulled off some bold rescues that left him  shaken afterward as he wondered how he managed to avoid getting pounded into  the pier's pilings or onto the big rocks up by the harbor.  </P> <P> At his age, Buckner is pleased to be in top condition and is envied by the  younger lifeguards.  </P> <P> "Two of the younger guys said 'you amaze me, Tom,' " he said. He shrugged and  added, half facetiously, "I amaze myself."  </P> <P> The years flow by for a lifeguard, and Buckner, who contrary to the stereotype  of a bronzed, bikini-crazy beach bum, has a masters degree in business  administration.  </P> <P> He figures it's almost time to hang up his fins.  </P> <P> But, Stephens said, "I don't know, I think Tom will be a lifer." For himself,  Stephens added, "I could do this until I retire."  </P></p>

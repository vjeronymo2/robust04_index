			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Lloyds bid for Midland hit by Brittan decision LLOYDS BANK said yesterday it was determined to proceed with its proposal to buy Midland Bank despite a severe blow to its hopes from Sir Leon Brittan, the EC competition commissioner. Sir Leon said he believed a bid for Midland from Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation fell within Brussels' jurisdiction while Lloyds' rival proposal would not. Lloyds was confident Sir Leon's announcement was an interim statement and did not mean the Hongkong bid would definitely fall outside UK jurisdiction. Lloyds wants both bids to be investigated by Britain's Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The Financial Times reported yesterday that the Office of Fair Trading was planning to recommend that Lloyds' proposed bid  - but not the HSBC offer  - be referred to the MMC. Separately, Lloyds challenged Midland's refusal of commercial information needed for a formal bid. Midland has already supplied the information to Hongkong Bank. Midland said its directors believed it would be wrong to release confidential information when it was still unclear whether Lloyds would be able to bid for it. Lloyds said it expected a ruling from the Takeover Panel in due course. This is the first time that Sir Leon, the EC competition commissioner, has intervened during the Commission's routine one-month inspection of important takeovers and mergers to make such an announcement purely about jurisdiction. An EC official said Sir Leon had done this to clear up mounting speculation about how scrutiny might be divided between Brussels and London. However, the official said that in the unlikely event the Commission was given further relevant information, Sir Leon could change his mind about who has jurisdiction. The Commission said it was simply a matter of geography and arithmetic that brought the HSBC bid within  - and the Lloyds proposal outside  - the remit of the EC's 1990 merger regulation. In the case of Midland and HSBC, 'enough of their business together is done outside the UK to bring the vetting of such a merger to us', the EC official said. 'The competition implications of the HSBC bid are therefore being considered in the normal way during the remainder of the one-month inquiry period', Sir Leon said in his statement. The Commission has until late May to decide whether to clear the bid or to launch a full-scale four-month inquiry. The UK has only two grounds on which to ask to deal with the bid itself. It could invoke the merger regulation's Article 21, which deals with non-competition aspects, to argue that prudential concerns require the bid to be vetted in the UK. The Bank of England has already let it be known it sees no threat posed by the HSBC bid to Midland's depositors. The UK's second option is to claim, under Article 9, that the HSBC bid poses special competition problems within the UK. But this argument may be hard to sustain, given HSBC's geographical base. The Commission has already sbown itself extremely unwilling to entertain member states' pleas on these grounds. In any case, the UK has little time to decide whether to use this latter option. According to the regulation, a member state must request a referral within three weeks of getting a copy from Brussels of the merger notification.

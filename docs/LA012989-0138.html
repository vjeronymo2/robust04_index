			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KING SCORES 48 AS NO. 4 OKLAHOMA EDGES NO. 13 LAS VEGAS, 90-88  </P> <P> Stacey King scored a career-high 48 points and Mookie Blaylock made a steal  with 2 seconds left Saturday as No. 4 Oklahoma held off No. 13 Nevada Las  Vegas, 90-88.  </P> <P> UNLV, trailing 90-86 with 42 seconds left, made 2 free throws to pull within 2,  and then forced a turnover with 10 seconds to play. But Blaylock intercepted a  pass by Anderson Hunt to preserve Oklahoma's second victory over Las Vegas this  season.  </P> <P> King scored Oklahoma's final 7 points and 13 of the last 18 as he surpassed his  previous high of 40 points in a game last season against Missouri.  </P> <P> "We just couldn't guard King at all," said Jerry Tarkanian, UNLV coach. "He is  by far the best offensive center in the country.  </P> <P> "King and Blaylock were everything they were supposed to be. Every time I  thought we were making a run at them, he (Blaylock) came back and made a  3-pointer."  </P> <P> Blaylock had 23 points for Oklahoma (17-2), which had beaten UNLV, 83-81, in  November in the semifinals of the Maui tournament.  </P> <P> Hunt led UNLV (14-4) with 22 points, and Stacey Augmon had 17, 15 in the second  half.  </P> <P> King dominated the game from the outset, scoring 28 points in the first half  against foul-plagued George Ackles and David Butler, who both fouled out in the  second half.  </P> <P> But Las Vegas, after trailing 51-47 at halftime, took the lead early in the  second half and expanded it to 72-68 on 3 straight 3-point shots midway through  the half.  </P> <P> Blaylock made 2 jumpers to tie the score, 72-72, however, and King took over  from there, scoring all but 5 of remaining points for the Sooners.  </P> <P> King's 2 free throws made it 90-86 with 42 seconds left. Hunt made a free throw  with 33 seconds left, and UNLV retrieved the ball out of bounds under its  basket with 27 seconds to play.  </P> <P> After Barry Young missed a 3-point shot, Augmon was fouled on the rebound and  made the second of 2 free throws to make it 90-88. Hunt forced Oklahoma's Tony  Martin to throw away the inbounds pass with 10 seconds left.  </P> <P> King scored 17 of Oklahoma's first 25 points as the Sooners ran to a 27-19 lead  midway through the first half.  </P></p>

			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Survey of Light Rail Systems (1): Manchester's Metrolink - a testbed for Britain / The tram is making a comeback in the UK, while more than 300 tramway and light rail systems are already operating in Europe and the US IT is nothing short of a transport revolution. Exactly 30 years after Britain's last street-running trams (other than those in the seaside resort of Blackpool) made their final journeys to the sheds, the tram is making a comeback - not as the slow, clanking beast of old, but as a sleek, fast and efficient form of modern transport. Today, after several months of delays, the first 10-mile section of Manchester's new light rail system is due to open. Called Metrolink, it heralds a new era for public transport in Britain: for unlike earlier light rail schemes such as the Tyne &amp; Wear Metro and the Docklands Light Railway, the system (pictured, right) will see modern-day tram cars mixing with people and traffic on the streets of the city centre. In one sense, this is nothing new. It is more than 100 years since the world's first electric tramcars went into operation on the streets of Blackpool in 1885. By the First World War, trams served more than 120 towns and cities throughout the UK, reaching their peak in the late 1920s when there were about 14,000 tramcars in service. The pattern was repeated throughout the developed world. It was the growth of the motor bus which was the tram's undoing. By the end of the Second World War, much of the tramway infrastructure installed earlier in the century was overdue for costly replacement. Low petrol prices made its replacement with motor buses a cheap alternative. Outside Blackpool, where trams were seen as a tourist draw, tramways in Britain went into decline. The last one, in Glasgow, closed in 1962. In North America, they were retained in several cities, but investment was low and usage declined. France, Spain and most of Italy saw their tramways go. Only in Germany, Belgium, Holland, Switzerland and Austria were tramways retained and developed. Now, however, the tram has come back into favour. Where once it was regarded as a noisy, slow and down-market means of transport reviled for obstructing other road users, perceptions have drastically changed. Today's tram bears little resemblance to its predecessor. More like a small train than the old wooden double deckers, it typically consists of a pair of single-deck cars running comfortably and quietly at speeds of up to 50 mph once it clears the city centre streets. No longer is the tram regarded as an obstacle. Just the opposite: it is now promoted as a means of tempting people out of their cars and back on to public transport to help provide a solution to ever-worsening traffic congestion. Because it is electrically powered, the tram is seen as environmentally friendly. It can also be used as a means of stimulating regeneration in depressed inner city areas, as with the Docklands Light Railway; and it adds a certain amount of prestige to a city's image. It is this combination of factors which has led to a resurgence of interest in light rail. More than 300 systems are operating on the European Continent and in North America, with the tally growing fast. In the UK, such is the enthusiasm for them that about 40 towns and cities have projects on the drawing boards. Getting those schemes off the drawing boards and on to the streets, however, can sometimes prove problematic. The UK has lagged far behind the rest of Europe in translating the dreams of its city planners into reality. The Docklands Light Railway and Tyne &amp; Wear Metro were mainly conversions of existing 'heavy' railway lines. All but the city centre sections of Manchester's Metrolink system, too, comprise former British Rail suburban lines. Projects involving large-scale construction of new infrastructure are proving much more difficult to progress. The main obstacle is cash. Building new tramway systems is an expensive business (the first Metrolink line is costing more than Pounds 130m). In most cases it is too much to hope that the likely revenue streams from a completed light rail project will come close to covering the construction and financing costs, still less provide the promoter with a reasonable return. The result is that promoters - in most cases, local authorities - can only hope to proceed with the projects if they obtain central government grants towards the capital costs. These grants - known as Section 56 grants because they are awarded under Section 56 of the Transport Act 1968 - are very difficult to procure. The government starts from the view that, where possible, public transport should be self-financing. Where it is satisfied that overriding social objectives make an otherwise unviable project desirable, it is prepared to consider a grant: but in doing so, it requires the social benefits to be quantified in financial terms, and it will only include non-user benefits in the equation. (Users, it is assumed, will be ready to pay the full value of their benefits through the fare-box.) The main non-user benefit is relief of congestion to road users, but local authorities also try to quantify benefits to industry or such nebulous factors as enhancement of a city's image. The difficulty of quantifying such benefits leaves the Department of Transport endless scope for quibbling over the calculations and turning down applications. Even when an application succeeds, it then has to join a long queue of other public sector projects awaiting funds from a tight-fisted Treasury. Critics contrast the system applied to new road schemes, where the absence of any direct mechanism for charging motorists means a different system of assessment has to be adopted. In this case, the user benefits are counted, mainly by putting a financial value on the time savings accruing to motorists. The department's forecasts of traffic growth make this such an easy test to pass that few road schemes ever fail it: so with the department's budget for road schemes more than 100 times greater than its budget for light rail schemes (more than Pounds 2bn a year compared with Pounds 20m a year), it is not surprising that many more roads than light railways are built. What local authorities in Britain would like to see is something more akin to the Continental system, where public transport and road schemes are assessed on a comparable basis. The result of ern Europe's cities with populations of more than 600,000 already have some form of tram or light rail system. In Britain, only two schemes are in the pipeline after Manchester's: the Sheffield Supertram and the Midland Metro. Debate over fixed route systems To some, Britain's hesitancy is well-founded. Prof Peter Hall, director of the Institute of Urban and Regional Development at the University of California, Berkeley, is one of a number of planners who have expressed reservations over light rail. Too often, Prof Hall argues, trams take people where they do not want to go. Their fixed, radial routes are ill-suited to increasing demand for suburb-to-suburb journeys. Britain's planners and local councillors, he says, should visit the much more flexible system in Essen, Germany, where buses roam freely around the suburbs, then enter a fixed guideway giving passengers an express ride into the city centre. Set against that background, the Manchester Metrolink is a testbed for light rail systems in Britain. If it proves popular with passengers, reduces congestion and operates without the need of crippling subsidies, it could soften the government's resistance to a plethora of look-alike schemes. If it fails to achieve those objectives - and the possibility cannot be ruled out - the tram revolution, in Britain at least, could end as suddenly as it started.</p>

			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Arts: Today's Television Channel 4 currently has a splendid Thursday night schedule. Tim Hunkin (whose naturalness and lack of eccentricities contrasts so pleasantly with the Loyd Grossman school of presenters) demonstrates the workings of machinery in The Secret Life Of ..turning today to the photocopier (8.30). When that ends at 9.00 the estimable Mary Goldring offers us The Goldring Audit. Her subject today is British Telecom, and she finds that, nine years after privatisation, Britain's largest company remains uncom petitive, overmanned and bureaucratic. Then, at 10.00, comes Drop The Dead Donkey the very funny series set in a television newsroom. What with this, One Foot In The Grave, The Golden Girls, Red Dwarf and Waiting For God we seem to be going through a period of classic comedy. Steve Humphries' series about child rearing in the first half of this century, A Labour Of Love is proving what a fascinating combination archive film and live reminiscence makes (9.30 BBC2). In Disguises (9.30 ITV) reporters go undercover with fox hunters and hunt saboteurs to report from both sides of the divide.</p>

			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Land issue distracts Mugabe's donors: Zimbabwe aid conference runs into some political barbed wire JUST SIX weeks ago the signs were that the western country donor meeting on Zimbabwe which starts in Paris today would be relatively straightforward. True, there has been some slippage in the implementation of Zimbabwe's five-year economic structural adjustment programme which western donors backed to the tune of Dollars 700m at a similar meeting in Paris last March. But a 45 per cent devaluation of the Zimbabwe dollar last year, the lifting of controls on most prices, the virtual freeing of interest rates - with the important exception of mortgage lending - a partial return to collective bargaining in the labour market, substantial increases in the export retention scheme and the launch of trade liberalisation reflect strong government commitment to economic reform. This is no mean achievement given the extent to which the reforms contradict just about everything President Robert Mugabe's ruling Zanu-PF party stands for. At three general elections, it promised voters socialist transformation of the economy, free schooling, improved health facilities, more and better jobs and housing and - above all - land redistribution. Today, it stands for a reduction in the fiscal deficit from almost 11 per cent of gross domestic product in 1991 to below 8 per cent. School fees have been re-imposed at primary level; 25 per cent of the public service workforce (excluding teachers and nurses) are to be laid off by 1995, price controls abandoned, parastatals commercialised or privatised and subsidies virtually abolished. So much for socialism. As a result, the voters are deserting Zanu-PF in droves to the point where few political analysts believe it can win a fourth term. What is fortunate for the government, elections are not due until 1995 and there is no viable opposition on the horizon yet, though Harare is thick with rumours that a broad front for multi-party democracy - like those established in Kenya and Zambia - will soon be launched. Zanu-PF's deepening unpopularity explains the decision to trundle out the Land Acquisition bill. Due to go to parliament at the end of this month, the bill seeks to give the state the power of compulsory acquisition of commercially-owned (largely white) farmland. The initial target is some 850,000 hectares, adjacent to the 'communal' (black peasant-farmed) lands where overcrowding and environmental degradation have long been a problem. The principle of compulsory acquisition is not disputed, but the means are. The bill's provisions for compensation are inadequate, there is no recourse to the high court and the principle of 'designation' has already struck at the very heart of the structural adjustment programme. The bill is an enormous embarrassment to donors, not just because it violates the principles of accountability and transparency which they believe are crucial to sound development strategies but because it threatens to undermine what has long been the dynamo of the Zimbabwe economy - commercial agriculture. Last year, for instance, when GDP grew 3 per cent, the main impetus came from tobacco, the bulk of which is grown by white farmers. Some donors, and especially the World Bank, are anxious to ensure that the land issue does not divert attention from the undoubted virtues of structural reform. The British, who part-financed previous largely-unsuccessful land resettlement in the early 1980s, had hoped to build a consensus among donors to force Harare to rethink the compensation provisions of the bill. But other bilateral donors show little enthusiasm for this. Zimbabwe's finance minister Mr Bernard Chidzero, who can have no illusions about the bill's potential for economic damage, will seek to calm the critics, trotting out the line that the legislation is merely political symbolism that won't be activated - if only because there are no funds - and should not be allowed to undermine the adjustment programme's grander designs. As a result, the donors, believing - with some justification - that Zimbabwe has a better chance than most of making a go of structural adjustment, are likely to stump up the Dollars 380m needed in 1992 and a further Dollars 700m for 1993. This on top of some Dollars 350m from the World Bank and the African Development Bank and an SDR400m (Dollars 564m) three-year IMF extended fund facility. But that will not be enough now that severe drought has forced a radical downward revision of earlier targets. These projected a 4.4 per cent rise in real GDP in 1992, 10 per cent growth in exports, a debt-service ratio of 20 per cent and a fall in inflation to 15 per cent at the end of this year from 28 per cent last December. So serious is the drought - and so ill-conceived government's agricultural pricing policies - that there is a real danger of a food crisis in April. Zimbabwe has enough maize to see it through until the end of next month, but will then need to import up to 1m tonnes to tide it over. Falling farm output and substantial food imports will force the donors to upgrade their support for Zimbabwe. Last year's current account deficit of almost Dollars 700m (12 per cent of GDP) was at one stage forecast to decline to Dollars 600m in 1992. Some forecasts are now for an increase to Dollars 900m. The best-case scenario is one of zero growth in 1992 and a limp recovery in 1993. The worst-case scenario - that looks more likely by the day - implies GDP falling 2-3 per cent while more than half the population of 10m people require food-aid assistance of some kind. There is a temptation to dismiss the Land Acquisition bill as an irrelevance, certainly in its present form. But to do that is to misunderstand the determination of some in the government to deliver elements of their political agenda, no matter what other indignities they have been forced to undergo by the donor community. There is also the lingering - if improbable - hope that land resettlement might just be enough to win the party the next election.</p>

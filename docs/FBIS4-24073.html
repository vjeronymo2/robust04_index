			<p>BFN     [Text] Cape Town June 22 SAPA -- Minister of Finance Mr  Derek Keys unfortunately went primarily for soft targets in  Wednesday's [22 June] budget, said Democratic Party [DP] finance  spokesman Ken Andrew. He said in a statement middle-income  taxpayers would be hardest hit. Individual taxes were up 18.4  per cent and had more than doubled in the past five years.    The R6.5 billion [rand] additional revenue from taxes on  individuals' incomes was "the highest ever".    The government was still living beyond its means. Continued  budget deficits were mortgaging South Africa's future and  pushing it ever closer to the debt trap that had financially  ruined many developing countries.    Mr Andrew said the government should have cut defence  spending, not increased it by 13 per cent. In contrast, spending  on police was up by only 6.5 per cent, less than the inflation  rate, at a time when crime was rampant. This made no sense.    The DP was not opposed in principle to the one-off levy to  finance South Africa's transition to democracy but was alarmed  by the enormous cost of the transition. The party would question  whether the money had been properly spent and adequately  controlled.</p>

			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Survey of Chemicals and the Environment (6): Clean air is important, but so are jobs - Switzerland's Big Three sense growing sympathy from a public worried about the economy Officially, this is Responsible Care year in Switzerland. The chemical and pharmaceutical industry is making a special effort to inform the public about the strategies and programmes it has adopted to ensure that the impact of its operations on the environment is minimised. But in reality, when the Swiss people think of their huge chemical and pharmaceutical companies these days, they have much more pressing concerns than environmental ones. Mostly, they want to know how Ciba, Roche and Sandoz are coping with the pressures brought on by health care reform in many countries. And how many of the companies' operations are likely to be moved away from Switzerland to other countries in the near future? How many jobs are likely to be lost? This represents a substantial change from the past few years when environmental concerns were foremost in people's minds, especially in Basle where all three companies are based. Relations between the companies and the people were badly damaged after Sandoz suffered a major environmental accident in 1986. The word Schweizerhalle still reverberates among chemical industry leaders and environmentalists everywhere. It is the name of a small town a few miles up the Rhine from Basle where Sandoz, one of three giant chemical and pharmaceutical groups based in the city, has a large chemical warehouse. In the early morning of November 1, 1986, a fire broke out in the warehouse, tripping sirens all over Basle and sending clouds of acrid smoke over the city. That was alarming enough for the residents, but it soon became apparent that an environmental disaster was occurring. As firemen pumped water on to the fire in the warehouse, it mixed with the chemicals. Something like 30 tonnes of dangerous agricultural chemicals, including 200kg of mercury, washed into the Rhine. A great deal of marine life, especially eels, was killed. Although no human life was lost, the fire could have led to widespread deaths through a release of phosgene. Investigations did not reveal any negligence on the part of Sandoz. Rather, the conclusion was that holding tanks should be installed around chemical warehouses to contain toxic liquids created by firefighting. No one had thought of the need for such tanks before, but they have since become standard installations throughout the world. Nevertheless, following the accident, relations between Basle residents and all three big companies deteriorated, and any projects they put forward for planning permission were subject to severe criticism and long delays. The companies quickly realised they were in trouble and set about reassessing their public affairs policies and programmes. They have put ever increasing efforts into educating the local public about their activities and listening to comments and suggestions from neighbours. Initially nervous about publishing data about their operations, they now release a blizzard of information. Ciba is probably the most aggressive. Last September, it published a brochure entitled Risks of the Basle Works, in which it listed the volumes of various chemicals it produced and the many nasty raw materials it consumed. The companies have become much quicker and more professional in responding to reports of accidents. For example, last December several containers slipped off a freighter in the North Sea during a storm, taking with them thousands of packets of Ciba's Apron Plus DS pesticide events. Ciba was immediately active in helping to recover the packets and warning Dutch and German authorities that some might wash up on their coasts. When a month later, some packets started appearing on the coast and the accident became public knowledge, Ciba was ready to reassure people that the chemical degraded quickly, so there was no danger to humans and very little impact on the environment. Similarly, Roche moved quickly to refute fresh charges by a European parliamentarian that toxic residues from its accident in Seveso, Italy, in 1976 had been deposited in a dump in Germany. Last year, all three companies for the first time published separate corporate environmental reports, explaining their programmes and measuring their progress in considerable detail. The companies have also joined various international programmes, such as the Business Charter for Sustainable Development launched by the International Chamber of Commerce and the World Industry Council for the Environment, established by the environmental summit at Rio de Janeiro, as well as the Responsible Care Programme. In the context of the Responsible Care year in Switzerland, the big companies are helping smaller ones to set up environmental protection programmes and showing them how to carry out audits. Sandoz is also running a two day course for secondary school teachers on the Responsible Care concept. These and other efforts, along with the passage of time, appear finally to have succeeded in healing the wounds of Schweizerhalle. This spring, for the first time since the accident, the chairmen of Ciba and Sandoz felt they could address shareholders at their annual general meetings without even mentioning environmental issues. 'We face other issues now. Media inquiries on environmental issues are back to the level of the early 1980s,' an official at one of the companies says. That does not mean that the companies will give environmental issues less priority. Their spending for environmental protection continues to rise, and they are all working on new processes that eliminate potential environmental hazards at source. Perhaps the final expiation of Schweizerhalle will come in the first half of next year when Ciba will open a SFr120m special waste burning facility in Basle. The project, initiated in the late 1980s, only got planning permission in 1991 from a then hostile community. Now it is hailed as a model of its kind.</p>

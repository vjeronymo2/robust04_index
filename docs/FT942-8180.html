			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Mandarin takes the job of putting on tea at the Ritz On Tuesday, 88 years after it first opened its doors, the Ritz will acquire new managers from Hong Kong in the shape of the Mandarin Oriental hotel group. Mandarin will not say what it wants to do with the hotel until after it moves in next week but surprises are unlikely. Afternoon tea at the Ritz will almost certainly retain its resolutely English flavour. The hotel therefore looks set to remain a London icon, along with others in Piccadilly such as the Royal Academy and Fortnum &amp; Mason. Trafalgar House, the shipping and industrial group which acquired the hotel in 1976, had been hoping to sell the Ritz, but was unable to find a buyer. It will continue to own the property, while Mandarin Oriental, which operates hotels in Asia and San Francisco, manages it. Trafalgar House and Mandarin Oriental have the same chairman, Mr Simon Keswick. Jardine Matheson, which controls Mandarin Oriental, is Trafalgar's largest shareholder. Mr Brian Williams, who takes over as the Ritz's general manager, is British. He is currently general manager of the Mandarin Oriental in Macau. The Ritz has always been a cosmopolitan establishment. It was built to the specifications of Cesar Ritz, the Swiss hotelier. He had retired by the time it opened in 1906, but he graciously described it as 'a small house to which I am proud to have my name attached.' The interior is in the style of Louis XVI. Its ground floor arcade was designed to remind visitors of the Rue de Rivoli in Paris. Sir Nigel Broackes, former chairman of Trafalgar House, first had an inkling he would buy the Ritz after he found a pearl in his oyster while lunching there. 'I am a faintly superstitious person,' Sir Nigel said in his autobiography. Two months later, Edward Erdman, the estate agent, asked him whether he wanted to buy the hotel. Mandarin Oriental yesterday pledged itself 'to continue the high standards of service and the traditions for which the Ritz is renowned'. Staff will be hoping that the new managers begin in more generous fashion than the old ones. Sir Nigel recounts that when Trafalgar House took over, it told the staff there was no money for a pay rise, but they could each have a new suit instead.</p>

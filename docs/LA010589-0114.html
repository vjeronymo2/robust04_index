			<p><P> January 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARCHDIOCESE, UNION AGREE TO FEB. 8 VOTE BY GRAVEDIGGERS  </P> <P> The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles and the Amalgamated Clothing and  Textile Workers Union announced Wednesday that they have agreed to a Feb. 8  election to determine if the archdiocese's cemetery workers will be represented  by the union.  </P> <P> The state Mediation and Conciliation Service will conduct the voting by the 140  gravediggers at the archdiocese's 10 cemeteries and supervise the vote count at  a church later that day, the announcement said.  </P> <P> Church and union representatives also agreed to set up a fact-finding panel to  settle any pre-election disputes.  </P> <P> The organizing campaign started last spring, and the question of whether and  when an election would be held has been a source of contention for several  months. In October, the National Labor Relations Board said it would not  conduct an election, stating that to do so could lead to "excessive  entanglement" of a government agency in church affairs and thus violate the  First Amendment.  </P> <P> Soon afterward, the union asked Archbishop Roger M. Mahony to agree to an  election supervised by a neutral third party. He agreed and initially an  election was set for mid-January. The date was changed after the archdiocese  objected to some of the union's tactics.  </P> <P> Wednesday's pact resolved one key dispute between the two sides. The union  agreed that none of its organizers will enter cemeteries to electioneer between  now and the vote. But the church agreed to let union representatives stand  immediately outside the cemeteries to campaign among the workers as they leave  and enter work.  </P></p>

			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / International Company News: Hutchison Whampoa cuts dividend HUTCHISON Whampoa, the diversified Hong Kong conglomerate, yesterday surprised the colony's financial community with a 20 per cent cut in interim dividend and a substantial write-down of its investment in Husky Oil, a Canadian oil and gas producer. The company took an above-the-line write-down of HKDollars 1.42bn (USDollars 183.7m) on Husky, cutting by half the book value of the investment it first made in 1986. In 1991, it wrote off HKDollars 760m for a fall in the value of Husky's oil and gas reserves. The latest write-down pushed the group into first half net losses of HKDollars 78m, compared with profits of HKDollars 2bn a year earlier. Although it is a non-cash item, it will affect Hutchison's gearing. Mr Archie Hart, head of research at Crosby Securities, the Hong Kong brokerage, said: 'Husky goes down as one of the world's worst acquisitions. It is on a par with Midland Bank's acquisition of Crocker.' But the market, which had been expecting a Husky provision, was further disappointed by a deterioration in the company's underlying profitability, apparently due to the poor performance of Hutchison's UK telecommunications business. Mr Li Ka-shing, chairman, said that given the planned substantial cash requirements for the development of the company's UK telecommunications business, it was considered prudent to cut the interim dividend by 20 per cent to 16 cents from 20 cents. He said losses in the UK would continue for the next few years, but added that the long-term potential of the business was promising. Turnover advanced to HKDollars 10.2bn, from HKDollars 9.4bn. Operating profits fell slightly to HKDollars 1.9bn from HKDollars 2bn. Husky again appears to be the main problem at the operating level, together with UK telecommunications and possibly the company's satellite television venture, Star TV. Analysts said Hutchison's Hong Kong operations - principally its container port interests, property development, retailing and telecoms - all performed reasonably well. Analysts said that, paradoxically, Mr Li was about the only investor in Hutchison to benefit from the company's woes. Last year, he raised HKDollars 881.4m through the issue of 273m covered warrants over Hutchison stock - equal to 7.5 per cent of the company. Hutchison has under performed the market since. If it continues he may not have to face conversion, they said.</p>

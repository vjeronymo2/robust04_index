			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Minister of Foreign Affairs Geza Jeszenszky has  reported to the Human Rights Committee of the National Assembly  on the situation of Hungarians living beyond the border and on  the Hungarian Government policy regarding the minorities.  Karoly Levai reports.    [Levai] It is not true that the stance of the Hungarian  Government has become more radical regarding the issue of the  Hungarian minorities beyond the border, Foreign Minister Geza  Jeszenszky said. He added that they had always laid equal  emphasis on the establishment of good neighborly relations and  the assertion of rights of the Hungarian minorities living in  the neighboring countries. Neither of these two issues should  be given preference, said the foreign minister. According to  him, there are not any problems in those countries where the  Hungarian minority is not significant or where minority rights  are granted. It is true, however, that there are countries  where the situation of the Hungarian minority is changing  unfavorably. Thus, for example, our reservations concerning  Slovakia's admission to the Council of Europe unfortunately seem  to be vindicated, the foreign minister said, adding that the  situation of the Hungarian minority there depended on the Slovak  domestic policy. Geza Jeszenszky, however, did not wish to  express his opinion on it. He said: the ideal solution would be  if minority rights were regulated legally in every country, just  like us. Until then, the handling of these issues in a way  which satisfies both sides, should be helped by the  establishment of mixed committees.</p>

			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / International Company News: Revco files new proposals for reorganisation REVCO, the Ohio-based drugstore retailer which has been in bankruptcy since 1988, yesterday filed an amended reorganisation plan with the bankruptcy court - improving the cash recovery element from an earlier scheme. Revco creditors are already facing a reorganisation proposal from Jack Eckerd, a rival chain, which essentially involves Eckerd acquiring Revco. Yesterday, Revco said it was tabling its new plan in order to give creditors a choice. It added that the new scheme should give creditors recoveries 'equal to or better than other plans in the case' and should 'ensure an independent Revco, proposes no massive store closings and preserves thousands of jobs'.</p>

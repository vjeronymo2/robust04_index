			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / International Company News: Securities losses hold back net at S Korean banks TOTAL operating profits at South Korea's 21 commercial banks rose 39.1 per cent to Won1,128bn (Dollars 1.43bn) during the first half of 1992. Net profits, however, increased by only 9.9 per cent to Won332bn, according to the country's Office of Bank Supervision. The slower growth in net profits was blamed on appraisal losses on securities due to the slump in the Seoul bourse, as well as increased loan-loss provisions as bankruptcies rose 66 per cent to a record level. The six main commercial banks - Cho Hung, Commercial Bank, Korea First, Hanil, Bank of Seoul and Korea Exchange - reported total net profits of Won133.6bn, an increase of 2.2 per cent. They have larger securities holdings than the provincial banks and a bigger exposure in corporate lending. Operating profits among the six main banks rose 51.1 per cent to Won712.1bn. The sharp rise in operating earnings reflected the big interest rate margins enjoyed by Korean banks. The interest rate margin is around 4.5 per cent compared with 2.3 per cent for US banks and 1.9 per cent for Japanese banks. Although interest rate margins on short-term funds have expanded due to recent financial deregulation measures, controls remain on other interest rates. Total interest income rose 34.1 per cent to Won1,440.7bn. Non-interest income, including premiums and foreign exchange gains, increased by 20.2 per cent to Won543.9bn. Cost grew at slower pace than income, up 24.7 per cent. Korea First Bank had the highest operating profits at Won139.9bn, an increase of 59.9 per cent. It also reported the largest increase in net profits among the main commercial banks, with a rise of 112.6 per cent to Won45.7bn. Hanil had the largest net profits at Won48.3bn, an increase of 3.6 per cent. It ranked second in terms of operating profit at Won130.3, a rise of 36.9 per cent. Cho Hung reported a 34.9 per cent increase in operating profits to Won124.8bn, but net profits fell 58.7 per cent to Won12.6bn, the steepest decline among the main banks. Korea Exchange had the highest increase in operating profits among the main banks, with a 107.5 per cent rise to Won124.1bn. Net earnings rose 40.3 per cent to Won10.1bn. Commercial Bank had a 46.5 per cent increase in operating profits to Won108.3bn, but net earnings fell 15.6 per cent to Won12.4bn. The Bank of Seoul suffered a 55.9 per cent drop in net earnings to Won4.5bn, although operating profit rose by 35.5 per cent to Won84.7bn. Shinhan, a Seoul-based bank, was the most profitable in the country with net earnings of Won65.8, an increase of 7.3 per cent. It also had the second highest operating profits at Won130.5bn, a rise of 48.5 per cent. SOUTH Korea's three largest consumer electronics groups reported mixed sales results for the first five months of 1992, writes John Burton. Samsung Electronics, the biggest electronics concern, achieved a 2.1 per cent rise in turnover to Won709bn (Dollars 902.6m). It said sales of colour TVs and audio systems rose 8 per cent, while demand for VCRs slid 16.4 per cent. Sales of air conditioners also plunged 50.5 per cent. This was due to a government campaign to discourage their use in order to save electricity and reduce the country's oil import bill. Goldstar unveiled a 3.5 per cent drop in sales to Won507.5bn due to lower demand for VCRs, washing machines, refrigerators and air conditioners. Sales of audio systems, however, rose 11 per cent, while microwave oven sales rose 29 per cent. Daewoo reported a 21 per cent jump in sales to Won302.3bn. The introduction of a new 'air bubble' washing machine resulted in a 172 per cent increase in washing machine sales, to Won53.5bn. Colour TV sales rose 85 per cent to Won42.7bn.</p>

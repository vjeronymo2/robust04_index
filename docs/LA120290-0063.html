			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE: TO CULVER CITY, ONCE-TROUBLED YOUTH IS HERO  </P> <P> After gangs, drugs and alcohol became a way of life, David Mendenhall decided  it was time to make a change.  </P> <P> The road to sobriety has not been an easy one, but with determination  Mendenhall has been clean and sober for the past year and a half. In honor of  his turnaround, the Culver City Council presented him with a commendation and  proclaimed Nov. 26 David Mendenhall Day.  </P> <P> Mendenhall, 19, who lives in Culver City, said the biggest lesson he's learned  is the importance of time and how to work with it even when times are hard. "I  want to set a good example," he said. "I want to be someone who has made a  difference in the community." He also attributes the turnaround to his  involvement with the American Youth Awards program. Since 1973, the program has  honored and awarded youths who have made positive impressions and achievements  in society. At Saturday night's 1990 American Youth Awards ceremony at the  Culver City Auditorium, Mendenhall was the recipient of the organization's  highest award, the Founder's Award, given to a youth with a negative past who  has turned his life around.  </P> <P> He also wrote and produced a play for the evening. "I took my own life  experiences and put it into a play, which will hopefully inspire other kids to  make better lives for themselves," he said. "Every kid has a chance and they  just have to take it."  </P> <P> Tel Aviv University in Los Angeles will present its Friendship Award to Jewish  community leaders Dorothy and Avram Salkin.  </P> <P> The Friendship Award recognizes the Salkins' contributions to Jewish education,  synagogue and communal life.  </P> <P> A tribute gala will be held in their honor on Wednesday at the Beverly Hills  Hotel.  </P> <P> The West Los Angeles/Brentwood Rotary Club presented Alvin Mills with the Paul  Harris Medal for outstanding community service.  </P> <P> In 1952, Mills founded the Brentwood-Westwood Symphony and has been conducting  it for 38 years.  </P> <P> He was recently honored at the Rotary Club's annual Maurice Buerge Community  Recognition Luncheon.  </P> <P> Roger Simon has been selected as the 1990 Man of the Year by the Los Angeles  Men's ORT Federation.  </P> <P> Simon will receive the award at the 11th Annual Chanukah Brunch on Dec. 9 at  the Bel Age Hotel.  </P> <P> Santa Monica resident Dr. Eugene Nebeker has been selected as the 1990  California Conservation Farmer of the Year by the National Endowment for Soil  and Water Conservation.  </P> <P> The award is given in each of the 50 states in recognition of good soil and  water resources management, as well as for prevention of air and water  pollution from agriculture and for assisting others in learning how to protect  the environment.  </P> <P> Nebeker, a graduate of Stanford University and Caltech, has a ranch in  Lancaster.  </P> <P> Hugh Rappaport, a senior at Beverly Hills High School, has been recognized for  outstanding performance in writing by the National Council of Teachers in  English.  </P> <P> He is one of more than 800 national winners of a 1990 Achievement Award in  Writing from the Council.  </P> <P> Items for People can be mailed to People, Los Angeles Times, Suite 200, 1717  4th St., Santa Monica 90401.

			<p><P> March 31, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA;  </P> <P> STRICTER RESIDENTIAL CONTROLS PROPOSED  </P> <P> Planners in Ventura took the first major step Friday toward revising the city's  comprehensive zoning ordinance by proposing tighter controls on residential  development and a ban on front-yard parking.  </P> <P> These are some of the changes being proposed:  </P> <P> Density reviews would be established for all residences before building permits  are issued.  </P> <P> The reviews would make it more difficult for developers to build illegal units.  Basements that could be easily converted into independent units, for example,  would have to be redesigned.  </P> <P> Transitional zones would be abolished. Developers in low-density zones now can  build more units than otherwise allowed if the properties are located next to  higher-density or commercial zones. This practice is called transitional zoning  and is not allowed in the proposed ordinance.  </P> <P> To maintain open space and privacy in small beach lots, these properties would  no longer be allowed to have an accessory structure added to the main building.  </P> <P> The number of units allowed for residences built in commercial areas would be  reduced from two units for a 1,600-square-foot lot to one unit.  </P> <P> Parking would not be allowed between a residence and a street, unless it was in  a parkway leading to a garage. This provision is designed to prevent placing  parking places in the front yard, which planners say has become a common  practice in the city.  </P> <P> The draft ordinance will be reviewed by the council in a series of upcoming  public study sessions, the first of which will take place April 5 at the  Community Meeting room in City Hall.  </P> <P> After the council's recommendations are added to the ordinance, a series of  public hearings will follow before the final draft is presented to the council  for final approval.

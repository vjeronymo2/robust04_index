			<p><P> August 12, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV AND THE DEATH OF A COLONEL  </P> <P> As much as I admire Calendar columnist Howard Rosenberg, he needs to rethink  his position on the showing of the corpse of Lt. Col. William R. Higgins on  prime-time television ("Hanging Video: What Is TV's Role in Terror?," Aug. 2).  </P> <P> Rosenberg feels this portrayal was grotesque, obscene, unnecessary and  dangerous. I agree it was grotesque and obscene, as are the Shiites who  perpetrated the hanging and their "justice." As to unnecessary and dangerous, I  disagree.  </P> <P> I ask Rosenberg to read Tom Clancy's op-ed article, also printed in The Times  on Aug. 2, in which the novelist called for a hard line in responding to  terrorism.  </P> <P> After reading it, perhaps Rosenberg would perceive there is a need for  Americans to view the cruelties of the world so we can deal with them. We need  to realize there are bad people out there who want to hurt us.  </P> <P> When dealing with people such as the ones who killed Col. Higgins during his  captivity, we Americans need to call up our freedom-loving spirit and act, not  send a "message" to those who are not listening.  </P> <P> LYNDA GALLUP  </P> <P> Ventura  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Yun Pyong-son: "Bellicose Nature Cannot be </F> Concealed"]    [Text] The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique frantically staged  the so-called Hwarang war exercise in Inchon and the areas of  Kyonggi Province during 25-29 April.    The puppets are now raving that this war was aimed at  countering someone's infiltration and enhancing defense  preparedness. However, this is nothing but a sophism to mislead  the media at home and abroad and to conceal their bellicose  nature.    The entire world officially recognizes that there is no such  threat of a southward invasion on the Korean peninsula. Even  though the puppets are raising a clamor as though we would at  once invade the South, many patriotic figures who have visited  the Northern half of the Republic unanimously say that there was  no such moves, and that they have not detected any of those  moves, and that North Korean society is in peace.    Not long ago, traitor Kim Yong-sam himself virtually denied  the rumors on the threat of a southward invasion by saying that  the rumors on the war crisis on the Korean peninsula stemmed  from the U.S. media's irresponsible reports. This vividly  proves the absurdity of the rumors on the threat of a southward  invasion babbled by the puppets.    There is no such southward invasion but a northward invasion  on the Korean peninsula. This can be clearly seen in the  content of operations and the massive number of personnel that  were mobilized in staging the recent exercise.    In the recent Hwarang exercise, the Kim Yong-sam clique  mobilized the puppet army, navy, and air force and police, and  reserve forces -- over 1.3 million in all -- and perpetrated a  surprise mobilization exercise, a joint operation among Army,  Navy, and Air force, an airborne-operation, and a land operation  in an atmosphere of real warfare. What is more, they are  bluffing of a war-winning posture in the event of the firm  establishment of an emergency situation.    Denial of rumors on the war crisis while staging the Hwarang  war exercise and babbling about the firmness of war-winning  posture, clearly show that such war an exercise is part of their  maneuvers to provoke a war of aggression against the North.    As a matter of fact, it is an established fact that the  South  Korean puppets are attempting to provoke a war of aggression  against the North with the U.S. imperialists.    The U.S. imperialists, on the pretext of stopping the  North's  nuclear development, have not withdrawn their naval armed forces  concentrated on the waters of the Korean peninsula. Worse  still, they say they are ready for war and are massively  introducing combat equipment, including the latest-type Patriot  missiles and Apache attack helicopters into South Korea.    In the meantime, the South Korean puppets, along with the  U.S. imperialists, have mapped out a northward invasion plan  called the New Operation Plan 5027 and are playing with fire to  carry it into practice.    The U.S. imperialists have perpetrated aerial espionage on  the northern half of Korea on 250 occasions in April alone.  This clearly shows how desperately the rascals are running  about in their maneuvers for a war of aggression against the  North.    Timed to coincide with this, the Kim Yong-sam clique staged  the Hwarang exercise by mobilizing the puppet army, police, and  reservists. It is obvious that the Hwarang war exercise is  aimed at provoking a war of aggression against the North to  drive not only the puppet army but also the para-military forces  and inhabitants into it. The puppet clique cannot by any means  conceal its bellicose nature, and only runs out to the road of  confrontation and war.    The Kim Yong-sam clique's criminal acts of rejecting the  fellow countrymen's proposal on convening a great national  meeting; turning the Korean peninsula into a war ground;  becoming a vanguard of implementing the U.S. policies of  invasion and war; and bringing in the fiery cloud of war on the  Korean peninsula will never be tolerated.    We (?want dialogue), but we are not in any sense afraid of  war. If the puppets set the fire of war on this land, our people  and our People's Army will rise as one to provide the rascals  with ignominious defeat.    The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique should look squarely at the  unshakable will of our people who do not say empty words, and  should not act recklessly like a puppy with no fear of a tiger.</p>

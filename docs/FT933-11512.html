			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / Matisse boosts Christies SALES AT Christies Inter-national, the fine-art auctioneer, rose 16 per cent to Pounds 683m in the 1992-93 season which ends this month. But in dollar terms - major works of art are valued in US dollars - the gain on the year was only 1 per cent, to Dollars 1.05bn. Mr David Tyler, finance director, said yesterday: 'We feel generally encouraged. There has been a slow consolidation, and the mood has improved in the last six months.' However, the art market still has a long way to go to approach the heights of 1989-90. Nine works of art fetched prices above Dollars 5m, compared with six in the 1991-92 season. Six were Impressionist or post-Impressionist pictures. The sums included Dollars 14.5m for a Matisse and Dollars 12.1m and Dollars 9.6m for Monet paintings. Two others which fetched more than Dollars 5m were Old Masters. The most encouraging factor was the return of some major buyers for post-1870 pictures, which were at the centre of the rise in the art market in the late 1980s. The auctioneer's sales in New York were up 28 per cent - 12 per cent in dollar terms - compared with a sterling rise of 10 per cent in the UK.</p>

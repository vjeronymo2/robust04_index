			<p>BFN     [Text] Guangzhou, June 25 (XINHUA) -- Pointing to their  factory which will soon start operating, two Japanese investors  said they were confident that they would reap an annual output  worth 40 million yuan -- and pride as pioneer investors.    "We chose to invest in this place because of its advantages  in regional location and its improving investment environment,"  said Miyajima Yuko, chairman of the board of the Doumen Meifu  Textile Co. Ltd. in southern China's Zhuhai Special Economic  Zone (Zhuhai SEZ) near Macao.    Yuko and Arai Koji, vice-chairman of the company, from the  Mee Loong Trading Co. in Hong Kong, have spent 28 million yuan  on 18,000-square-meter workshops. The company, in Wushan town  of Doumen county, will produce woolen and cashmere products,  camel hair and rabbit hair products to be exported to Japan, the  United States, Britain and Canada.    The small county of Doumen, under the administration of the  Zhuhai SEZ, has become an area popular with overseas investors.    In Wushan town alone, six projects based on overseas  investments have been started this year, involving a total  investment of 520 million yuan.    The town is about 2 km off the expressway linking Zhuhai  airport and Zhuhai port, both under construction.    "It is not very convenient now, but that will change after  the airport and sea port are put into operation the coming  October," said Yuko, adding: "We are sure that our investment  will have good economic returns."    Officials from the county government said that they have  signed contracts involving 505 overseas-owned or cooperative  projects. The overseas investment contractual volume topped 369  million U.S. dollars and actual investment reached 153 million  U.S. dollars.    The hometown of 152,000 overseas Chinese living around the  world, the county accounts for more than 50 percent of the  Zhuhai SEZ in terms of area and population. It has become one  of the most important areas open to the outside world in  Guangdong Province.    Infrastructure facilities have been improved to a large  degree.    In the past, major means of transport were small boats and  ferries, as the county is composed of 22 islands. The  completion of the Zhuhai bridge and five other minor bridges  made the county more accessible from the SEZ and helped bring an  economic boom to the county.    Annual total output value in the past 14 years grew at an  average of 25 percent, reaching 3.084 billion yuan last year.    Besides the Zhuhai airport and the Zhuhai sea port, the  planned quasi-express railway from Guangzhou to Macao via Zhuhai  will run across the county.    Several other projects, including an electric power plant  and  a water-works, are under construction.</p>

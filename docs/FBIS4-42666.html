			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] The Greek press reacted to the  appointment of Yiannos Papandoniou as minister of national  economy following the death of his predecessor Yiorgos  Yennimatas.    Opposition New Democracy [ND] leader Miltiadhis Evert was  notified first about the impending appointment of Papandoniou as  minister of national economy, a move that augurs well for the  government treating the opposition with respect, according to  Nikos Nikolaou, writing in the 8 May Athens weekly TO VIMA TIS  KIRIAKIS. Evert was told even before Bank of Greece governor  Ioannis Boutos, who had been angling for the position.  Explanations vary as to why Boutos lost out, Nikolaou reported.  According to one version, certain Panhellenic Socialist  Movement [PASOK] officials took advantage of the poor reception  the Bank of Greece's annual financial report was given in the  mass media to represent him to Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou  as a "monetarist," a "rightist radical," and a minister who  would adopt harsh economic measures liable to cause public  resentment against the government. According to Nikolaou,  Papandreou decided against Boutos because he needed Boutos at  the Bank of Greece, which has had an increasing role in  financial and foreign exchange policy, particularly as the 1  July deadline approaches for the freeing of capital movement.  Greece's European Union [EU] partners also appreciate the fact  that the nonpartisan Boutos is at the helm of the country's  principal financial institution. Still another reason, Nikolaou  observed, is that the appointment of Boutos, who enjoys the  confidence of Brussels but is considered an "outsider" in PASOK  because of his ND past, was viewed with distrust by PASOK trade  union leaders fearful of his economic policies. In contrast,  Papandoniou, whose views and economic remedies are similar to  Boutos', is a longtime PASOK official and central committee  member who can implement the necessary economic measures without  angering PASOK trade unionists, Nikolaou contended.    Papandoniou is "young, handsome, well-educated, and liked by  both the business establishment and trade union leaders,"  Nikolaou continued. While these attributes are "indispensable,"  they are not enough, he claimed, for he also needs the kind of  leadership style possessed by former Ministers of National  Economy Yerasimos Arsenis and Kostas Simitis. Nikolaou, who  holds that the Ministry of National Economy should play an  essentially coordinating role, questioned whether Papandoniou  would be able to exert control over, and coordinate, such  diverse officials as PASOK secretary general Akis  Tsokhatzopoulos, Minister of Environment Kostas Laliotis,  Minister of Labor Evangelos Yiannopoulos, and Minister of  Industry Kostas Simitis. Only the ability to do so will ensure  the success of his ministry, Nikolaou concluded.    According to a brief article in the 8 May Athens daily I  KATHIMERINI citing "informed sources," Boutos was not "unhappy"  about losing out to Papandoniou. Despite the fact that until a  few days before Papandoniou's appointment Boutos was still the  "favorite" in the race, the governor of the Bank of Greece was  not prepared to follow, as national economy minister, a course  at variance with the policies he advocates in his present  position, the paper said.</p>

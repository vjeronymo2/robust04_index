			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by FNB: "Kivela Fears Collision With Center"] </F>   [Excerpts] The brewing dissatisfaction within the  Conservatives Party over the Center politicians' actions,  primarily on the European Union [EU] issue, on Sunday [17 April]  caused open expressions from the party leadership as well. Party  secretary Pekka Kivela said in a speech in Kouvola that the  major government parties will very soon end up on a collision  course, unless it is possible to find a common view.    The crash is looming due to the Center's acrobatics on the  EU  issue as well as to statements by Center politicians regarding  increased taxation.    Kivela said that Center Party statements favoring a  postponement of EU membership "from a factual viewpoint means a  rejection of membership." At the same time the Center Party's  finance minister is taking a negative standpoint on the need for  tax cuts and in favor of increased taxation of business activity  through a higher energy tax, among others.    "Finland's EU membership is a necessity if a favorable  economic development is to be assured in the future. Increased  taxation would, in turn, lead to undermining of the positive  turnaround in economic development that has already happened.  The Conservative Party cannot be a part of promoting such a  policy," Kivela stated.    The Conservative Party therefore takes for granted that the  government should without delay make a decision about the date  for the national referendum on the EU and about the compensating  national subsidy measures in connection with the EU agreement.  Decisions must also be made in May about the budget framework  for next year, so that measures for easing income taxes can be  carried out even this year. [passage omitted]  <H5>  EU Report Needed </H5>   Member of parliament Tarja Halonen (Social Democrat) demands  a short, balanced, comprehensive study of the negotiating result  with the EU and its effects. But the government itself should  also take a position on such a study, she says.    In Halonen's opinion, the Finnish Government, compared to  the  government of the other applicant nations, has acted in an  unusually self-satisfied manner. In Sweden, for example, one has  tried harder to keep the Riksdag up to date during the  negotiations. Halonen also wonders how the government, with its  internal confusion, will even be able to come to a decision on  the EU question. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Aerostructures Hamble given Pounds 68.6m price tag Aerostructures Hamble Holdings, the former British Aerospace aircraft components subsidiary, finalised its flotation yesterday, pricing the shares at 120p to produce a market capitalisation of Pounds 68.6m. The offer comprises 33.33m ordinary shares, of which 20.83m will be placed firm with institutions. The remainder will be subject to a clawback to meet retail demand through intermediaries. Some Pounds 26.5m net will be raised from the issue of 23.33m new ordinary shares. The money will be used alongside a new Pounds 10m unsecured revolving credit facility to repay Pounds 35m of debt incurred during the Pounds 47.6m management buy-out in 1990. The directors will be selling 2.9m shares, reducing their holding from 29.9 per cent to 12.1 per cent of the enlarged share capital. They are retaining 70 per cent of their existing holdings. Institutional shareholders are selling some 7.1m shares, reducing their stake to 29 per cent. Aerostructures Hamble occupies the site near Southampton where Sunderland flying boats were built. It made operating profits of Pounds 7.98m on turnover of Pounds 70.4m in 1993, compared with profits of Pounds 7m on turnover of Pounds 71.3m in 1992. Pro forma pre-tax profits for 1993 are put at Pounds 5.6m, after allowing Pounds 2m for restructuring. The prospectus gives a notional dividend of 3.74p for 1993, and puts the expected interim dividend this year at 1.44p. The notional historic gross yield is 3.9 per cent. Adjusted pro forma earnings of 10.10p for 1993 give a multiple of 11.9. The company depended on BAe for 93 per cent of its business in 1990, but reduced that to 78 per cent last year. New orders already won include a substantial contract from Boeing for wing parts for the 737-700. 'The amount of new business we have won in the time we have been around I would describe as extraordinary,' said Mr Andy Barr, chief executive, yesterday. Dealings are due to begin on June 9. The flotation is sponsored by NM Rothschild and the broker is Smith New Court. COMMENT The senior management, all with experience at Rover Group, has put into practice in the aircraft industry some of the Japanese techniques learnt in the car business. Margins have improved from 8.9 per cent to 11.3 per cent in three years. The challenge now is to grow by increasing volumes, which could prove tough going given the downward pressure on subcontractors. Competitors - including BAe itself - will not be slow to copy Japanese methods. However, the group is moving in the right direction, with a broadening customer base, and the issue looks realistically priced.</p>

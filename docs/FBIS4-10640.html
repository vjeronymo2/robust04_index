			<p>CSO     [Excerpt] The two major projects to modernize and expand  the production capacity of the Amuay and Cardon refineries,  which will make it possible to increase production of  reformulated gasoline by 100,000 barrels per day, call for  investment of 130 billion bolivars this year, according to a  PDVSA [Venezuelan Petroleum, Inc.] report which includes  additional information about other aspects of this industry in  Venezuela.    The report says: "The dynamics of the market for  hydrocarbons, the new environmental regulations of the  industrialized countries, and the premise that we will continue  to be a top oil-producing country lead PDVSA to continue to plan  considerable investments in the medium and long term to upgrade  its national refineries in order to adapt the variety of refined  products Venezuela sells to the changing demands of the world  market."    In most industrialized countries, the governments have  established deadlines for compliance with environmental  protection standards without reducing gasoline octane ratings.  In view of these standards, PDVSA's operating subsidiaries are  carrying out an investment plan to ensure the quality required  on our markets. Among their projects are the El Palito  oxigenates plant, which came into operation in 1993, and the  plant that is being built in Cardon. These plants will permit  exports of reformulated gasoline to the United States beginning  in 1995.    The investments, which are around 130 billion bolivars in  Venezuela in 1994, are focused mainly on the Cardon Upgrading  Project (PARC) and the Amuay Delayed Coker (CRAY). These  projects will contribute to increasing the processing capacity  for heavy crudes in Venezuela's current refineries by 100,000  barrels per day by 1995, while at the same time reducing  residual fuel production by about 25,000 barrels per day in  comparison with 1994 production.

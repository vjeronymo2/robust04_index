			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / BCCI auditors face Dollars 8bn suit PRICE WATERHOUSE and Ernst &amp; Young, the leading accountancy firms, are to be sued for an estimated Dollars 8bn (Pounds 4.6bn) for alleged negligence and breach of contract in their audit of Bank of Credit and Commerce International. BCCI's liquidators, led by Mr Brian Smouha, of the accounting firm Touche Ross, will in the next few days serve their statement of claim in their case against PW and Ernst &amp; Young. The damages claim relates to writs against the two accounting firms issued by the liquidators in the UK high court in March. The writs allege negligence, breach of duty and breach of contract relating to BCCI audits for 1985 and 1986. The damages claim, thought to be a record for any claim in the UK, relates to losses suffered by BCCI since 1986. Ernst &amp; Young and PW will contest the actions and are confident of their legal position. After serving the statement of claim on the two firms, the liquidators, which are acting for the holding company and its Cayman Island and Luxembourg subsidiaries, are not obliged to make the details public. They have not decided whether to disclose the huge sum claimed, pending the start of a trial. Last night Mr Smouha refused to comment. Until 1987, PW and Ernst &amp; Young both acted as auditors to the BCCI group of companies. PW then took sole responsibility for auditing BCCI's businesses. BCCI was closed by the Bank of England in July 1991, after it discovered evidence of a huge fraud in the bank. Accountants have been facing a growing number of ever larger legal claims in recent years in connection with their role as auditors to collapsed companies. As a result, the accountants have found it increasingly expensive to purchase insurance to cover the risk of such action.</p>

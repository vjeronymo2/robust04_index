			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Survey of Portable Computers (9): Capacity soars - Memory Technology / Further big increases in portables' memory capacity are on the way SEMICONDUCTOR technology is readily predictable. This makes it a relatively simple task to work out what the future for portable computer memory capacities will be like. The real question, therefore, is not how much memory can be made available, but how it is to be exploited. Random access memory (RAM) chips, the most commonly used in personal computers, now hold 4 megabits (MBits) of data, equal to 0.5 megabyte (MByte) or roughly equivalent to some 85,000 words. Over the next year, the first examples of chips with four times that capacity, 16Mbits, (2 MBytes or nearly 350,000 words) will start to appear. Top-end portable computers already come with around 4 Mbytes of RAM as their main user memory, so it is relatively easy to predict that this will rise over the coming years to 16 Mbytes, and then 64 MBytes (roughly 10m words). The same chips can and will be used in smaller portable computers as well, such as the popular notebook machines, and the handheld 'palmtop' and pen computer systems. In terms of memory capacity and processor performance, there is now only one technical reason why the capabilities of the largest desktop PC cannot be put into a palmtop machine, and that is the display technology available. There was one other technology hindering such a development, the magnetic disk drives used for on-line data and program storage, but at a technical level this has largely been overcome by the growing availability of cards built to the standard defined by the Personal Computer Memory Card International Association (PCMCIA), which numbers over 180 computer companies in its membership, many of them leaders in their field. This standard exploits the increasing capacity and functionality of semiconductor technology to, at the base level, provide an alternative to the magnetic disk drive for small portable computers. The technology developed for the PCMCIA standard, however, is capable of providing much more than just memory capacity. It can couple that capacity with additional functionality and intelligence. This is not to suggest that the magnetic disk drive has lost its role in portables. The technology continues to be developed aggressively, with both the physical size of the units and the cost-per-megabyte stored coming down rapidly. Physically, disk sizes of 2.5 ins diameter are now commonplace, with capacities of 20 MBytes and 40 MBytes now typical. This will rise to 60 MBytes and 80 MBytes this year, according to leading drive manufacturer, Conner Peripherals. At Pounds 10 per megabyte stored on a Conner 40 MByte drive, it is impossible for semiconductor technology to beat disks on price. In terms of size, unit price and capacity, therefore, the majority of laptop and notebook portables will still be using magnetic disk drives. Their one major weakness - power consumption - will be tackled in part by the reduced physical size of the drive motor and actuators needed, and in part by improving software to manage the power consumption. There is little chance, however, of this weakness being overcome sufficiently to accommodate the needs of the growing palmtop computer market. Users here are seeking longer than three to four hours working life from their batteries, a capability the smallest hard disk drives cannot provide, even if the latest developments of 1.5 ins diameter disks means that credit-card-sized units can be produced. It is with the palmtop machines that the PCMCIA standard card format is starting to make an impact, though its presence is starting to be felt in notebook portables as well. The standard defines a physical form factor for add-in cards - about the size of three or four credit cards stacked one on top of another. It also defines the connector pin-out and what can be achieved with them. The objective, as with all standards, is to have as many hardware suppliers using it as possible, thus creating a market for card suppliers in all their guises. This is greatly helped by the convergence last year of PCMCIA standards with those of the Japan Electronics Industry Development Association, (JEIDA). The two are now claimed to be fully compatible, allowing JEIDA-standard cards to be used in PCMCIA-compliant computers and vice versa. The most obvious guise for PCMCIA cards is as a hard disk alternative. Here a variety of solutions are on offer, including battery-backed RAM chips linked together as a module. More recently, flash memory technology, a variant of electrically erasable programmable read only memory (EEPROM) technology from companies such as Intel, has come to the fore. For systems designers, the trade-off between the two is capacity, price and flexibility. RAM-based units currently hold more data, but need to have a small lithium battery as part of the card design, in order to maintain the data as stored. Typical capacities to date are up to 10 MBytes per card, though Santa Clara, California-based SunDisk, the company of PCMCIA president, Mr John Reimer, claims the lead with a 15 MByte card. Predictions are for 100 MByte cards to be available within three years, though these will not beat magnetic disks on price per megabyte stored. Flash memory, on the other hand, retains the data as a read-only memory (ROM) does, without any need to keep refreshing it, but allows the system to re-write the data as required. This is analogous to magnetic media. According to Mr Reimer, the most important aspect of PCMCIA is as a prompt for entirely new developments, particularly in applications software distribution. Companies such as Lotus Development Corp have already ported its 1-2-3 spreadsheet to this format with success, where the application code is held in ROM together with RAM chips for the data the application generates. Mr Reimer expects many other applications providers to follow Lotus' lead, especially as its joint effort with Hewlett-Packard in the development of the HP95LX palmtop has led to sales of around 50,000 units per month. As the latest, Version 2.0, of the PCMCIA standard also includes the definition of other input/output capabilities, the potential opens up for combining memory with other functionality. At present, cards offering fax/modem and local area network capabilities are under development, but as Mr Reimer says, 'developers are limited only by their imagination in what they can now produce with PCMCIA technology.' One of its most interesting advantages stems directly from its exploitation of semiconductor technology - 'we are reaching a point where the data held in a card memory is worth more than the cost of the system that generated it,' says Mr Reimer. 'Because of the technology, these cards can withstand a 500g drop and still function. A palmtop or pen computer can easily be dropped, breaking the machine and losing the data. With PCMCIA cards, that data can be recovered by putting the card in a new machine.'</p>

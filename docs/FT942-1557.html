			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses recover on better news from US The news from America was better. Mr Stanley Fischer, the future IMF deputy managing director, said the world economy was 'in great shape'; Mr Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve chairman, made the requisite noises about domestic inflation as he testified in Congress to the House Budget Committee; and President Clinton raised hopes by saying that a statement on the dollar would be forthcoming later in the day. In Europe, bonds responded, equities followed and short- covering did the rest, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT regained Tuesday afternoon's losses, rose further to close the session with the Dax index at 1,994.42, and climbed again in the post- bourse to 2,004.93, up 47.85, or 2.4 per cent, over 24 hours. Ms Barbara Altmann of B Metzler in Frankfurt said the recovery started in the bond market, encouraged by Tuesday's M3 figures which were lower than generally expected and by yesterday's further cut in the repo rate, 5 basis points to 5.00 per cent. Germany has high long bond yields and a reducing inflation rate, said Ms Altmann, indicating high real yields on the longs and, potentially, a profitable switch from short-dated instruments. In that context the chances for equities, after a Dax fall from nearly 2,300 in mid-May to just above 1,950 this week, were better than the risks, she maintained. Financials, however, were weak, looking at the prospect of end-June figures based on bond trading performance to date. Deutsche Bank fell a further DM7 to DM686.50 and Allianz DM17 to DM2,285. Turnover edged up from DM8.3bn to DM8.5bn. The best rise of the day came from Deckel Maho, up DM5.70, or 20 per cent, to DM34.20 on talk of a rescue plan for the ailing machine tool maker. MILAN's strong rebound surprised most observers, although the equity market took its more positive outlook mainly from strength in bonds. Sentiment was also helped by expectations that the government would make an announcement today on proposals to restrict growth in this year's budget deficit. The Comit index improved 13.00 to 691.63. There were gains across the board, with no specific stories predominating; but the good rises were seen especially in the industrial sector. One of the day's best performers was Montedison, up L86 at L1,473. PARIS made gains in line with the more optimistic picture throughout the Continent. The CAC-40 index advanced 26.26, or 1.4 per cent, to 1,917.04, but brokers cautioned against reading too much into the rise as sentiment remained edgy. Peugeot gained FFr8 at FFr783, although the vehicle manufacturer forecast a slowdown in market growth during the rest of the year. Skis Rossignol put on FFr95 to FFr1,940 as it said that it expected to cut its debt burden this year, and forecast a rise in turnover. Eurotunnel ended up FFr1.15 at FFr25 with the group due to announce the take up of its rights issue by the weekend. ZURICH was among the best bourseperformers with a rise of 2 per cent, the SMI index ending 51.5 higher at 2,595.7. The recovery was led by banks, UBS rising SFr33 to SFr1,119, CS Holding by SFr21 to SFr539 and SBC by SFr16 to SFr389. Pharmaceuticals also gained with Roche certificates rising SFr55 to SFr6,405. However, the recovery was said to be vulnerable. Volume was low and dealers said that the gains were too fragile to lay the basis for a new upward trend. AMSTERDAM needed little encouragement to break out of the downward trend experienced for more than a week and, drawing inspiration from bonds, the AEX index gained 6.05, or 1.6 per cent, at 382.74. KLM added 10 cents at Fl 45.70, the stock having been upgraded recently to a buy by Paribas Capital Markets. In explanation Mr Chris Avery, the analyst, said the airline's results for the year to March had confirmed its recovery story, even though it had benefited from a pension holiday. He added that Northwest, in which KLM has a 20 per cent stake, was now making a positive contribution to the group. MADRID's technical recovery, tentative for such a volatile market, left the general index just above the 300 mark again with a rise of 3.78, or 1.3 per cent to 300.76. A reduction in block trades left turnover considerably lower than in recent days at Pta34bn. Utilities were relatively strong, Iberdrola recovering Pta25, or 2.7 per cent to Pta950 after recent losses aggregating around 10 per cent. Banks were mixed, even after some late buying interest. ISTANBUL fell 2.4 per cent on profit-taking following the market's recent strong run last week when it gained more than 20 per cent in dollar terms. The composite index lost 490.58 to 19,703.93, after an early high of 20,402.14.

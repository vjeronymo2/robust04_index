			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / BR sells non-core business for Pounds 5m TRANSMARK, British Rail's international consultancy business, has been sold for about Pounds 5m to Halcrow, the engineering consultants, as part of the privatisation of BR's non-core businesses. Transmark, which has worked on more than 200 rail projects in 30 countries, made an operating surplus of Pounds 1.1m on a turnover of Pounds 10m in its last financial year. Halcrow said that Transmark's background in rail operation and design would complement its own engi-neering and transportation skills. After the acquisition Halcrow will have a staff of more than 2,000 people generating an annual turnover of Pounds 90m. It operates in 70 countries with about 80 per cent of its sales overseas.</p>

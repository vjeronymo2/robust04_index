			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Arguments in support of boxing not substantiated Sir, Nigel Spivey's article, 'Punch drunk and proud' (November 19/20), rehashes the over-used and unsubstantiated arguments in favour of boxing. His view reflects the current attitude of many of boxing's supporters. With the evidence for chronic and acute damage in professional and amateur boxers increasing by the year, it is difficult for supporters to claim no damage is occurring. Boxing supporters therefore turn to their back-up arguments regarding the benefits of boxing for young boys and to the relative dangers of other sporting activities. Boxers must be sick and tired of being told that, if they were not boxing, they would be unable to overcome 'their disadvantages'. The situation for young people in inner cities is of great concern to doctors, but the BMA would recommend improvements in housing, unemployment, education and leisure facilities rather than promoting an activity which leads to chronic brain injury and life-long suffering. As for comparisons with the dangers of other sports, the data are not beyond question. The one distinguishing feature of boxing is that there are no accidental injuries; each blow is a legitimate and intentional part of the sport. If all the incidences of significant blows to the head were recorded as injuries in boxing, as they are in other sports, the data would without doubt reveal that boxing is a uniquely dangerous activity. Let us hope that the armed forces give this new scientific evidence the respect it deserves, rather than casting it aside in favour of unsubstantiated claims about boxing's character building and disciplining effects.

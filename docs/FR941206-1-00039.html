			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Summary of Findings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the requested SIP revision submittal, Illinois has projected motor vehicle emissions until the statutory attainment year of 2007 using the most recent population and economic growth projections. These projections went through public hearing and comment on June 22, 1994. Using a VMT forecast of 2.7 percent per year, these projections show that motor vehicle emissions are not expected to rise above the ceiling level through the year 2010.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, Illinois has identified and evaluated a number of specific TCMs to reduce single occupancy vehicle usage. Several of these identified TCMs are currently being implemented.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Illinois has met the first requirement of the VMT offset plan. Illinois has demonstrated in the July 14, 1994, submittal that projected growth in VMT is not expected to result in an increase in emissions from motor vehicles and is not expected to negate the progress in emissions reductions required to meet attainment of the standard by 2007. In addition, Illinois has used TCMs as necessary to meet the 15% RFP requirements by 1996. The third requirement is for Illinois to use TCMs as necessary to meet the post - 1996 RFP and attainment of the standard. This third requirement will be submitted with the post - 1996 RFP and attainment demonstration SIPs and will be addressed in a future rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Proposed Rulemaking Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on the submittal accompanying the State's SIP revision request, USEPA is proposing to approve the SIP revision submitted by the State of Illinois as satisfying the first and second elements of the three VMT offset plan requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future notice will inform the general public of these tables. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from the requirements of Section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for 2 years. The USEPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the temporary waiver until such time as it rules on USEPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. The OMB has exempted this regulatory action from Executive Order 12866 review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to any SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et seq., USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, USEPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Act do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-state relationship under the Act, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The Act forbids USEPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / Economics Notebook: Questions over Latin American bond wagon THE welcome mat is still out for Latin American borrowers in the international bond market. The funds raised so far this year already exceed last year's total, but will the welcome last? According to figures from Peter West, of West Merchant Bank in London, 59 Latin borrowers raised Dollars 6.74bn (Pounds 4.5bn) in the second quarter, outstripping the previous record first-quarter tally of Dollars 3.49bn. So far this year, new Latin bond issues have totalled Dollars 10.2bn, more than 1992's entire output of Dollars 9.6bn. In an active half-year in the international bond market, they have accounted for 5 per cent of the funds raised. The first-half total was swollen by some big Mexican private-sector issues, including the largest issue by a Latin American company - a Dollars 1bn issue for Cemex - and a Dollars 750m bond for Bancomer. More big issues are on the cards: the US subsidiary of the Venezuelan state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela plans a Dollars 1bn issue in the US public bond market. Argentina is putting together a Dollars 1bn medium-term note programme, of which the first tranche is expected to be a Dollars 250m bond. More Chilean issues could follow the Dollars 150m bond for Celulosa Arauco y Constitucion, which achieved the lowest yield spread yet over US Treasuries of any Latin corporate bond (210 basis points). These include a bond for the republic at a very aggressive spread, indicating its investment grade status. However, some market watchers see cause for worry. At a recent City Forum conference in London, Mr Gerrit-Jan Tammes, vice-chairman of ING Bank, of the Netherlands, cited comparisons between today and the 1870s when Latin American bonds were being bought by 'country clergymen, widows, poor professional men and tradesmen'. Default ensued with 'parallels simply too striking to ignore' to the present day. 'Now, as then,' he said, 'we have seen a relative deterioration in the quality of borrowers accessing markets; less and less transparency in the intended uses of funds borrowed in the markets; and more poorly-informed players in the market on both the sales and the investor sides.' In the 1920s, too, the international capital markets were accused of, according to authors Barry Eichengreen and Richard Portes, 'all manner of excesses'. Among other things, 'the issue houses pushed questionable obligations on hesitant borrowers and questionable bonds on otherwise cautious investors' and 'private investors discriminated inadequately between good and bad credit risks'. In fact, every half century or so has seen another Latin American debt crisis: the 1820s, 1870s, 1930s and 1980s. Indeed, the 1980s crisis may have taken less time to resolve, in the sense that borrowing countries have regained access relatively rapidly to foreign capital. One reason for this rapid return to grace is that Latin governments had the good sense in the 1980s to burn foreign banks instead of foreign bondholders. With only minor exceptions, they kept bondholders happy. The small amounts of outstanding bonds meant that it was relatively inexpensive to do so. By contrast, the amount of debt in bond form now outstanding is significantly larger. In the first place, a lot of bank debt has been converted into bonds under the Brady debt reduction initiative. Eight countries - all Latin American except the Philippines and Nigeria - have issued Brady bonds with a face value of Dollars 94bn. According to JP Morgan Securities, about Dollars 81bn of this is in readily tradeable form. Furthermore, since 1989 - when Bancomext of Mexico launched a Dollars 100m issue to reopen international capital markets for Latin borrowers - some 250 issuers have launched more than Dollars 25bn of Eurobonds. This suggests that the 'specialness' that protected bond issues during the 1980s is gradually being lost. A huge variation in quality has also been evident, suggesting that the market's default-free reputation will not last for ever. For example, more Brazilian borrowers - their economy hardly the jewel in the Latin American crown - have issued bonds than any other country group. In the second quarter, 24 Brazilian issuers raised Dollars 1.7bn, second only to Mexico's Dollars 3.3bn. Brazilian banks have been particularly frequent visitors - launching standard Dollars 50m bonds with 2 1/2 -year maturities. Much of the money raised goes straight into the Brazilian money markets, where inflation-adjusted interest rates are high. Many of the buyers of this Brazilian paper - along with most of the Eurobond issues since the market reopened - have been 'retail' investors. These individuals, many of them Latin American, have been looking for better returns than have been available in more traditional markets, particularly the US. They tend to buy on the basis of yield, typically seeking double-digit interest rates. As the perceived credit quality of the region has improved, thanks to better economic management, they have had to seek riskier credits to preserve the required yields. It is far from clear that these investors will retain their interest in the market once US interest rates turn upward. In an International Monetary Fund staff paper published this year, Guillermo Calvo and others conclude that 'swings in private capital outflows from the US play a key role as external impulses that affect the size of capital inflows into Latin America'. One possible conclusion is that once the US market provides higher returns, some of these investors will forget Latin America. However, there is a counter-trend for which the Cemex issue provides evidence. It was not retail investors who swallowed Dollars 1bn of Cemex paper, but institutions, mainly from the US. These investors are more conscious of credit quality and not simply chasing high absolute yields. Their entry into the market suggests that higher-quality borrowers from Latin America may well have longer-term access to regular bond market finance - provided, that is, the region continues the economic improvement evident over the last few years.</p>

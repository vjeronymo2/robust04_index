[passage omitted]    Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri said he spoke briefly with  Amnuai before the latter departed for Phuket. "I have made it  clear to Amnuai that Thailand adheres to a one-China policy. He  says his planned meeting with Li is an informal one to discuss  business matters," Prasong said.    He said he yesterday also reiterated Thailand's one-China  policy with China's Ambassador to Thailand Jin Quihua when they  were seeing off Czech President Vaclav Havel at the airport.  "China should understand Thailand's foreign policy and accept my  explanation via its ambassador," Prasong said. [passage omitted]    Prasong said it did not matter if Amnuai received Li or  hosted a dinner for him and his entourage on personal level. "I  don't believe Amnuai will go to the airport to greet Li on his  arrival," Prasong said. [passage omitted]</p>

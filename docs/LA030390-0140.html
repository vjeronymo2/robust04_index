			<p><P> March 3, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BREA;  </P> <P> UNOCAL WINS OK TO INSTALL GENERATOR  </P> <P> City Planning Commissioners voted 4 to 0 this week to let Unocal Corp. install  a 3.8-megawatt power plant for its Science and Technology Center -- as long as  noise from the operation is kept down.  </P> <P> Residents living near the proposed electrical plant, at the northeast corner of  Imperial Highway and Valencia Avenue, remain skeptical but say the  conditional-use permit granted Wednesday was an improvement over earlier  proposals.  </P> <P> About 60 residents attended the commission meeting.  </P> <P> "We are still apprehensive," said local resident Pat Moore, "but all the  suggestions we made, (the Planning Commission) looked into. They have come a  long way."  </P> <P> The plant's noise level will be monitored at the beginning of its operation,  again after one year of operation and whenever a noise complaint is made,  Planning Commissioner Carl Clausen said.  </P> <P> Senior Planner Patricia Shoemaker said the conditional-use permit issued by the  planning board can be appealed to the City Council up to 10 days after its  approval.  </P> <P> Shoemaker said Unocal's noise-abatement program includes limiting the plant's  hours of operation from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. during weekdays and placing the  generator in a building to muffle any noise.  </P> <P> Shoemaker also said the electrical plant, which will replace six boilers now  being used at the Center, will also reduce carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide  emissions at the site.  </P> <P> Donald Clark, manager of Unocal's engineering services, said the plant could be  used by the city for power in an emergency situation.  </P> <P> The city's noise consultant, Otto Bixler of Acoustical Impacts International,  said Unocal's noise-abatement plan for the plant exceeds the city's noise  ordinance limit by only six decibels . The human ear cannot perceive a  difference in noise level less that three decibels, Bixler said. BONNIE SINNOCK  </P></p>

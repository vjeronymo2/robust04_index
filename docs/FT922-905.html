			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Weak brew for Sri Lankan tea sector reforms - A look at the government's partial privatisation of the plantations sector SRI LANKA has been forced to undertake its most ambitious privatisation exercise in an attempt to revive its tea industry. However, only the management of the estates is being taken over by the private sector. Overall control, including hiring and firing, will still be in the hands of political appointees, a fact that is causing some concern to aid donors such as the World Bank. In an attempt to sharpen up the management of the estates Sri Lanka - the world's largest tea exporter - is turning back to the expertise of the private companies that made Ceylon tea famous from the time a young English planter called James Taylor planted the first tea bush in 1876. For the past 20 years, since they were nationalised by the left-leaning government of Mrs Sirima Bandaranaike, the ownership and management of the island's largest tea, rubber and coconut estates has been vested in the State Plantations Corporation and the Peoples Estates Development Board. Traders say bureaucratic and centralised control over the state-owned plantations has led to waste, corruption and mismanagement. Continuing losses and the prospect of a drop in production this year because of a drought has forced the government's hand. Now the administration of President R. Premadasa has broken up the holdings of the two giant, state-owned tea plantation corporations and the ownership of 452 estates has been transferred to 22 regional plantation enterprises. The patent need to modernise the tea industry and improve its efficiency has overcome reluctance government reluctance to confront problems arising from the island's colonial history, Sinhala/Tamil racial tensions and troubled relations with neighbouring India. Plantation labour is 90 per cent Indian Tamil, descendants of workers brought from south India by British planters in the late nineteenth century. 'The point is that we have come to the end of the road,' says Mr Rupa Karunatilleke, plantation industries minister. 'What we need most is professional managers not government-appointed bureaucrats who worship financial regulations and administrative rules'. Sri Lanka remains the world's largest tea exporter with 225m kg sold abroad last year. While there was a 3 per cent drop in exports in 1991, far more worrying was the 15 per cent drop in export income. The turmoil in the former Soviet Union and the financial isolation of Iraq, both major buyers, explains this loss. 'But Iran and Pakistan have promised to buy more,' says Mr AR Munsoor, the trade minister, who recently visited Iran and had talks in Colombo last month with a top-level Pakistani trade delegation. 'We are fully alive to the importance of meeting the challenge of new technologies and consumer tastes,' says the minister. 'The volume of CTC (cut, tear and curl) teas traded in the world market exceeds the volume of orthodox teas.' At present only 3 per cent of Sri Lankan production is CTC, the type favoured in the UK. The boards of management of the regional plantation enterprises will be selected by the president on Mr Karunatilleke's advice. 'Competent persons with experience in plantation agriculture as well as in the tea trade will be selected,' says a ministry official. None the less, they will be political appointees, and the temptation to 'give jobs for the boys' will remain strong, says Mr. CV Gooneratne, an opposition MP. The government admits that 'hiring and firing' will be entrusted to the regional plantation enterprises rather than to the private sector managing companies. The World Bank pointed out recently that Sri Lanka's estates were generating large losses and were important contributors to the losses of the government-owned banks. 'While we understand the political sensitivity of the issue and wish the government success in the use of private management contracts, we must note that the international experience with this approach has not been successful where ownership has continued in the state sector,' it warned. Nevertheless, the bank and the International Monetary Fund have recently released Dollars 75m, the second tranche of a Dollars 450m Extended Structural Adjustment Facility.</p>

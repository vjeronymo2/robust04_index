			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ma Jiantang (7456 1696 1016), Ren Xingzhou (0117 </F> 5281 3166): "An Analysis of 1993's Price Situation and Forecast  of 1994's Price Trend." The authors are affiliated with the  State Council Development Center's Market Circulation Research  Department.]    [Text] Since 1993, in the wake of the sharp and rapid  increase in investment and consumption demands and the  accelerated pace of change in the market pricing mechanism, and  accompanying the nation's high rate of economic growth, market  prices have also increased fairly rapidly. Since June, in the  wake of the implementation of various macro regulation and  control policies, the grave inflationary situation has eased  somewhat, and regulation and control have slowly produced  results. But overall, the market price situation is still very  grim; the task of stabilizing prices is very arduous. Therefore,  diligently analyzing the 1993 price situation, correctly  assessing the 1994 price trend, and formulating appropriate  policy proposals are essential to ensure the sustained, speedy,  and healthy development of the national economy in 1994.  <H5>  I. Facts About the Price Increases in 1993 </H5>   The facts and characteristics of price increases in the  market in 1993 are as follows:    1. Nationwide, retail prices skyrocketed month after month.  Since March, the magnitude of price increases has been in the  double-digits, reaching a peak of 15.1 percent in August  compared to a year before. Price increase slowed somewhat in  September compared to August. From January to September, prices  rose 12.1 percent compared to the same period a year earlier.  The rate of increase for each month was 8.4 percent, 8.7  percent, 10.2 percent, 10.9 percent, 12.5 percent, 13.9 percent,  14.9 percent, 15.1 percent, and 14.5 percent respectively.    2. The market prices for food, clothing and necessities, and  industrial consumer goods and services were generally higher.  Between January and September, prices for each category rose  18.1 percent, 13.6 percent, and 39.3 percent respectively,  compared to the same period a year earlier. All three categories  are everyday necessities, the demands for which are fairly  inelastic. Pushed by these prices, the nation's cost of living  index climbed 14.5 percent in the January-September period  compared to the same period a year earlier, and in 35 large and  medium-sized cities, the index rose 18.9 percent, and in the  highest month (September,) it actually topped 23.3 percent,  which was the highest rate in recent years.    3. The momentum of market price increase in the rural areas  was especially strong. Between January and September, the rural  retail price index rose 11.8 percent compared to the same period  a year earlier, approaching the urban area's 12.6 percent rate  of increase.    4. Pulled by the demand for fixed asset investments, the  price of producer goods soared. Prices skyrocketed in the first  half of the year, rising by 38.2 percent in the first quarter.  Beginning in the third quarter, macro regulation and control  began to show results, and the excess demand for producer goods  eased and prices did not increase as much compared to the  previous two quarters. But prices were still high, and compared  to the same period a year earlier, the purchase prices of raw  materials, fuel, and energy were 40.6 percent higher. The  factory-exit price of steel rose 83.1 percent, cement price  increased 52.7 percent, and raw coal price rose 27.4  percent--compared to the second quarter of 1993, the rates of  increase have declined 3.3, 2, and 29 percentage points,  respectively.    Based on the above analysis, it is clear that because of the  high rate of increase in investments and the high cumulative  rate of increase in credit loans in 1992, total social demand  surged and prices soared in the first half of 1993. In the  second half of the year, even though macro regulation and  control clearly played a role in stabilizing the financial  situation, improving financial order, and curbing the increases  in the prices of producer goods and exchange prices, overall,  the basic factors that caused prices to rise have not  dissipated. Statistics showed that inflationary pressure was  still strong, or even stronger, in the second half of the year.  It is estimated that for the year 1993, the retail price index  for society as a whole was around 12.5 percent; the cost of  living index might reach 16 or 17 percent, and in the 35 large  and medium-sized cities, the cost of living index could be  around 20 percent.  <H5>  II. Analysis of the Causes of 1993's Price Increases </H5>   1. The surge in fixed asset investments: Investments have  sustained a high rate of increase since 1992; society's fixed  asset investment has increased 37.6 percent. From January to  September of 1993, the state-owned units completed a total of  401.5 billion yuan in investments, 66.4 percent more than in the  same period a year earlier. Specifically, investments in capital  construction increased 62.4 percent. In the first half of the  year, in particular, credit loans went out of control, and the  investment scope exploded, increasing by 69.3 percent compared  to the same period a year earlier. In the second half of the  year, with the implementation of various regulation and control  measures, although the increase slowed somewhat, it was still  significant. Excess investment demands necessarily push up the  prices of producer goods, and higher costs cause consumer  product prices to soar.    2. The increased force of price reform gave impetus to a  general rise in the price level: Since 1993, the force of price  reform has clearly increased. At the heels of decontrols in 1991  and 1992, the state-monopolized prices of grain and oil were  decontrolled; the prices of steel materials, coal, crude oil,  cement, and other basic raw materials were either decontrolled  or significantly readjusted; the prices of housing, gas, water,  electricity, and other utilities were raised, and the localities  generally revised their service-oriented fees in 1993. These  price reform measures no doubt raised the price level in society  as a whole.    3. The price increases in 1992 left a "rooster tail" effect:  Price reform made fairly big strides in 1992, and for the year,  40 billion yuan's worth of direct price adjustments were made.  Because most of the price adjustments in 1992 were introduced  after April, they had a significant "rooster tail" effect on  prices in the first half of 1993. According to a relevant  department, the price adjustments in 1992 were responsible for  approximately 4 percentage points of the price increases in the  first half of 1993.    4. Prices were affected by the drop in exchange prices: The  expanded investment scope increased the demand for imported  producer goods and caused an increase in demand for foreign  exchange, and adding the speculative activities, RMB's  regulation price plummeted, driving the prices of imports up,  which in turn drove up the prices of electronics and light  industrial products.  <H5>  III. Forecast of 1994's Market Price Trends </H5>   There is nothing we can do about 1993's high prices, and  1994  market price situation still appears grim, and the main reasons  are:    1. The expanded investment impulses linger: Judging by  conditions in the second half of 1993, although the macro  regulation and control measures have produced initial results  and the magnitude of increase in the scope of fixed asset  investments has diminished somewhat, it is estimated that  society's total scope of fixed asset investment for the year  still exceeded the previous year's by more than 46 percent,  surpassing the planned scope by 350 billion yuan. Both in terms  of investment value and investment scope, last year's increases  were the most significant since the 1980's. In terms of the  money supply, from 1 January to 17 November 1993, net currency  input topped 101.892 billion yuan, 24.374 billion yuan more than  in the same period a year earlier. This kind of large-scale  investment and increase in the money supply will have  significant effects on market supply and demand and product  prices in 1994. In addition, the guiding principle for the  economy in 1994 is accelerated growth, and the localities and  enterprises are full of investment impulses. If the money supply  and credit loans are eased once again, market prices may  continue to soar.    2. The fairly high rate of increase in income will further  drive up prices: From January to September 1993, the citizens'  income sustained a high rate of increase. In the cities and  towns, the residents' per capita monthly earned income rose 29.4  percent compared to the same period a year earlier, and  discounting the price factor, the actual increase was 12.7  percent. The peasants' income also increased. Judging from past  experiences, consumer prices are a function of income, and so  long as the people's income continue to rise, it will  necessarily lead to higher consumer prices. In particular,  because of their inelastic demand, the prices of food stuff,  everyday industrial goods, and various kinds of services will  increase.    3. Prices may be more erratic after decontrol: Currently,  the  prices of more than 85 percent of the producer goods and more  than 90 percent of the consumer goods and materials are  completely decontrolled. Decontrolled prices are very much  affected by changes in supply and demand in the market and are  more difficult to control at the macro level. When there is  excess demand, the price level will rise rapidly.    4. Because of strong demand in the domestic markets in 1994,  foreign imports will continue to exceed exports, and the price  of foreign exchange may rebound, leading to a rise in import  prices as well as the overall price level.    5. Price reform measures introduced in 1993 will continue to  have a "rooster tail" effect on 1994's product prices, and in  addition, some new price regulation items will be introduced in  1994, and they will have even greater effects on 1994's market  prices.    6. The steady rise in 1993's price level has produced an  effect on the people's consumption psychology (for example, in  some localities, there were rushes to buy gold and other goods  to hedge against inflation.) If prices remain high in 1994, it  will exacerbate the people's expectations about inflation, and  if not properly guided, it can lead to panic buying and in turn  push prices even higher.    Because of the above factors, 1994's market price situation  will remain very grim, and if not properly controlled, we may  not be able to keep the retail price level at single-digit. This  will have an adverse effect on reform and development.  <H5>  IV. Policy Suggestions on Curbing Inflation and Stabilizing </H5> Prices    1. We must make keeping prices relatively stable an  important  macroeconomic policy goal. Years of experience and lessons  showed that only if the price level is rising relatively slowly  can we attain a rapid rate of economic growth. This is because,  first, at a high rate of inflation, because the rate of return  on investments in industrial enterprises is relatively low and  most funds tend to flow toward stock speculations and real  estate investments and other nonproductive sectors where the  rates of return are high, we tend to have a "bubble economy." It  will cause the investment structure and the industrial structure  to deteriorate and damage the basis of rapid economic growth.  Second, with a high rate of inflation, the national economy is  tightly stretched, making it difficult to implement some of the  measures to promote reform and development, and this will make  reform more difficult and more risky, which will hamper the  establishment of the socialist market economy. Furthermore, when  the rate of inflation runs high, lawless speculators will take  the opportunity to disrupt market order, which will make the  marketization process much more difficult. In addition, a high  rate of inflation will have a ruinous psychological effect and  stir great dissatisfaction among the masses. Thus, whether from  the point of maintaining social stability, further deepening the  reform, or making a smooth transition toward the market economic  system, we must control the inflation rate. Only in this way can  we truly guarantee sustained, speedy, and healthy economic  development.    2. We must apply proper force on macro regulation and  control. In the wake of the implementation of various macro  regulation and control measures in the second half of 1993, the  overheated economy which plagued 1992 and the first part of 1993  has cooled; the excess market demand has eased, and the increase  in the price of producer goods has slowed, and these are  indications that macro regulation and control are producing  initial results. But at the same time, market sales have been  flat, more industrial enterprises have been losing money, and  not all of the state's key construction projects are fully  funded. These and other problems make it even more important to  gauge the proper force of macro regulation and control. It is  our opinion that under the circumstances, we must not "decontrol  at once" and blindly ease macro regulation and control. Some  regulatory and control measures should continue to be  implemented. But at the same time, we must exert proper force to  avoid the negative effects of severe economic fluctuations  caused by applying too much force. In particular, the price  increases in 1993 were the result of many factors that have  built up since 1992, over a fairly long period of time, and it  will take some time to lower the inflation rate. We must avoid  "stepping hard on the brakes." With this understanding, we  suggest that the price monitoring goal for 1994 should be to  keep the increase in the overall retail price level at around 10  percent.    3. We should implement a fairly tight monetary policy. From  January to 17 November 1993, net money input already topped  101.892 billion yuan, and it is estimated that by year-end, it  would reach approximately 150 billion yuan, which is a  significant scope. Considering that there is usually a  10-month-to-one-year time lag before the effects of excess money  input on product prices begin to show up, 1993's money supply  will have definite effects on raising product prices in 1994.  Therefore we should continue to implement a fairly tight  monetary policy in 1994 to keep the money supply within a proper  scope. In particular, we should maintain a positive interest  rate level. This will have a very critical effect on stabilizing  the financial situation, on the people's expectations, on  curbing the bloated demands, and on absorbing investment funds.    4. In 1994, when regulating and controlling the  extraordinary  increase in fixed asset investments at the macro level, we  should put the emphasis on readjusting the investment structure.  Investments in the state's key projects and production-oriented  projects that should be guaranteed must be guaranteed;  nonproductive-type investments should be kept down. We must give  full play to the functions of differential interest rates,  investment direction taxes, and other economic levers and  strengthen the regulation of privately-funded fixed asset  investments.    5. We should enhance the state's ability to regulate and  control market prices at the macro level. This includes: one,  setting up and perfecting a price regulation fund system for key  commodities at the central and local levels to promote  production, enliven circulation, and curb price increases; two,  setting up a special reserve system for everyday necessities to  regulate supply and demand and stabilize the market; three,  perfecting the market economy's price monitoring system.  Currently, prices of the absolute majority of consumer goods and  materials and producer goods and materials have already been  decontrolled. We need comprehensive economic, legal, and  administrative means to strengthen the management and monitoring  of the decontrolled prices. On the one hand, we should monitor  and check those prices more closely and be resolute in cracking  down on price gouging and exorbitant profits. On the other hand,  we should strengthen the industrial departments' direct  management of various product prices and set up and improve  various policies and laws and regulations to encourage  competition and curtail monopolies. In addition, it is also very  important to provide stronger planned guidance and rely more on  effective market exchange formats to reduce the recklessness in  production management and price fluctuations and give play to  the price regulation roles of various trade associations.    6. Coordinating with the restructuring of the tax system in  1994, we should work harder on collecting and administering  personal income tax and inheritance tax to avoid the draining of  state revenues, to regulate the citizens' income, and ease the  pressure on price increases.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] New Delhi, May 3 (XINHUA) -- India hopes the  growing Sino-Indian relations would receive "a cultural thrust"  with the first ever foreign cultural exposition opening in  Beijing on May 9.    This was expressed by the Indian Human Resource Development  Minister Arjun Singh last night when he was addressing a press  conference here.    The minister will inaugurate the festival which opens with  the performing arts components stringed together to play up the  main theme of "harmony."    The festival would last for 51 days. It was devised by the  Indian Council for Cultural Relations as a multi-discipline  extravaganza covering fine arts and folk arts, handicrafts and  textiles, a seminar on literary traditions with eminent writers  participating and an exhibition on English books published in  India.    A fashion show with emphasis on Indian motifs in  contemporary  garments and a film festival with eight feature films would also  take place.    India and China can benefit through mutual cooperation as  both the nations have deep cultural relations and common  interests, the Chinese Ambassador to India Cheng Ruisheng said  while addressing the Fifth National Conference of Indo-China  Friendship Society here yesterday.    He welcomed the exchange of cultural and other delegations  between the two countries for closer understanding.    India is the first country ever to make a major cultural  appearance in China in its recent history.</p>

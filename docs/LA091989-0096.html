			<p><P> September 19, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEW;  </P> <P> FORMAN TAKES SPOTLIGHT AT BON APPETIT  </P> <P> It was all Mitch Forman's show Sunday night at Bon Appetit. Even though the  keyboardist's trio included such high-powered notables as bassist Brian  Bromberg and drummer Tom Brechtlein, Forman was clearly in the spotlight.  </P> <P> Looking as intently dedicated to his collection of keyboards as inventor Rick  Moranis was to his reducing machine in "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids," Forman was  virtually in perpetual motion. Steaming through a collection of original pieces  bearing titles like "A Sea of Fertility" and "Polka For Mr. Nice Guy," he  played with a passion and intensity that frequently belied the abstract nature  of the compositions.  </P> <P> Forman's richly textured style varied as he moved from instrument to  instrument. On acoustic piano, his improvisations often overflowed with warmly  traditional harmonic clusters. His synthesizer work, in contrast, was densely  layered with overlapping sounds. Best of all, when he picked up an  over-the-shoulder keyboard controller, his single-note lines darted and danced  with the soaring levitation of a Space-Age Baryshnikov.  </P> <P> Bromberg and Brechtlein, two of the strongest young rhythm section players in  town, responded well to the driving urgency of Forman's music. Occasional  confusing moments caused by inadequate rehearsal time usually were recycled  into almost instinctive creative variations. It was the kind of  instant-recovery music-making typical of what happens when spontaneity breaks  out between good performers.  </P> <P> A longtime New York-based musician, Forman has been on the West Coast for less  than a year. But the Sunday night program clearly intimated that his  no-holds-barred, hard-swinging approach to fusion-styled contemporary music is  going to have considerable impact on the local scene.  </P> <P> Forman, Bromberg and Brechtlein can also be heard at Le Cafe in Sherman Oaks on  Sunday and Monday. -- DON HECKMAN  </P></p>

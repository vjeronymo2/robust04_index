			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Interior Minister Ramon Escovar </F> Salom by Olgalinda Pimentel in Caracas, date not given; first  seven paragraphs are author's introduction]    [Text]  Certainly, Ramon Escovar Salom is not concerned that people say  that he is still talking and acting like the attorney general.    About two months ago he took over the Ministry of Interior  Relations in Carmelitas. He wants to free Venezuelan politics of  that "old-fashioned attitude which many governments have had" of  hardening their positions on their own mistakes and of not  wanting to tell the truth. He said: "How am I going to say that  a thing is, when it is not?"    Therefore, he set up his office in the building inaugurated  by General Eleazar Lopez Contreras in 1936, not only ordering  the worn, red rugs to be cleaned but also having his office  "swept" to detect electronic listening devices. From that office  he stated unambiguously that the country has no money, that  succeeding governments have not given priority to personal  security, and that Venezuela has no clear idea of what its  position is on the narcotics traffic.    Furthermore, he intends to redefine the powers of the  Ministry of Interior Relations which, until now, has been the  center for bad relations and repression. He wants the ministry  to regain its powers as a government department from high level  politics. He said: "I am trying to ensure that democratic  institutions function properly." The personal security of the  ordinary citizen is the fundamental objective of his official  policy of state security.    He stated: "The security of all citizens and the right to  life are not adequately guaranteed in Venezuela. I must say  that, despite the fact that there are some people who say that I  am talking like the attorney general. No, I am speaking as a  government minister and I have to tell the truth. No government  should have any problem in recognizing that."    He stated that the subject of personal security is "very  complex," because several factors are involved which do not  depend on the government. However, the government must clearly  play its role. He said: "The first point which comes to mind is  that priority has not been given to personal security. We have  always tried to excuse this omission by saying that elsewhere in  the world, in New York, Lima, or Bogota, more people are killed  than here. And I always say that this is like the person who  says that someone drowned in water two meters deep, while  another person drowned in water four meters deep. In any case  they drowned, and it makes no difference."    He argues that there are countries which successfully fight  against crime by bringing society as a whole and the ordinary  citizen into the struggle, because, "governments and police  forces cannot do the job by themselves. Society must learn to  defend itself. Clearly, there is a negative factor here, the  absence of police in the streets. However, the first thing which  the present government did was to bring the police out into the  streets. If this is not possible, then there is the National  Guard. That is quite clear. It is also clear that the police by  themselves are not enough. They have many shortcomings. It is  also true that there are police who are involved in the rackets.  This problem is being dealt with, however. Some women friends of  mine even telephone me at home at night to complain of things  that are going on. Then I call the Metropolitan Police, even  though it may be nearly midnight. They are used to my calling  them at such a time to ask about some things. That is what we  are doing."    [Pimentel] What would you do if insecurity continues? Do we  have to take repressive action to deal with the problem because  we have not been able to develop a crime prevention policy?    [Escovar] It is true that there has not been a policy of  preventing crime. Repression is inevitable if there is no  program for preventing crime. The fact that the police are in  the streets does not automatically mean that we are following a  policy of repression. The presence of the police is a sign of  authority, as in any other part of the world. However, that does  not mean that human rights are being violated. I do not support  breaches of the law.    [Pimentel] How will you combine the necessary amount of  repression with your own training which once led you, as a  prosecutor, to say that there is no government of laws in  Venezuela?    [Escovar] I am trying to make sure that the criticisms which  I expressed as a prosecutor, and now take into consideration as  a minister, might correct a considerable number of mistakes. One  of my criticisms is that you have to educate the police. I have  sent instructions to state and city governments to that effect.  The instructions given to the police in the past have always  been repressive, aggressive, and authoritarian in tone. Why not  give them democratic instructions? Let them exercise their  authority. I am not pretending that the police are weaklings.  They have to exercise their authority, particularly in such a  violent city as Caracas, where they are exposed to being blown  away with the wind. They have to be a solid instrument of order,  but they do not necessarily have to harm the personal security  of the ordinary citizen.    [Pimentel] Is that the approach which you plan to use with  the MRI [Ministry of Interior Relations]?    [Escovar] That is the approach which I am using, and I would  like to emphasize other weapons which the Ministry of Interior  Relations has which do not exclusively deal with security,  although, of course, that is the most important element. I am  not going to criticize my predecessors in this position because  I am not going to become involved in that kind of discussion.  What I want to do is to redefine and reformulate the role of the  Ministry of Interior Relations as a ministry of government and  of politics. There are many public opinion groups which should  feel that they are being heard and respected. It is very  probable that later on I will present a plan for the  reorganization of the ministry for consideration by the  government.    We should remember, however, that state and municipal  governments have their own responsibilities. If a gun goes off  in a city square, this does not mean that the minister of  interior relations ordered it. You can establish order without  firing guns into the air. There are other means of repression,  such as antiriot teams. You cannot expect Caracas to be a  goody-goody city, and the government does not expect that it  will be, either. The government has to exercise its democratic  authority in a vigorous and firm way.  <H5>  Doors Which Open and Close </H5>   Escovar Salom does not believe that we face great  difficulties. He recalls the great political tensions which he  dealt with when he was the young director of the Faculty of Law  at the UCV [Central University of Venezuela] after the fall of  the Perez Jimenez government. The door which connected the  Faculty of Law and the Faculty of Humanities had been sealed. He  called a doorman and ordered him to open it. He explained that  this was quite a revolution and an enormous change in the  concept of university space. He said: "For example, there are  many doors which open and others which close. There are still  others which are unjustifiably open."    [Pimentel] In terms of state security the Ministry of  Interior Relations has two organizations within it which have  always been attacked because of their practices: the DIEX  [Directorate of Identification and Alien Affairs] and the DISIP  [Directorate of Intelligence and Prevention Services]. What are  you going to do with them?    [Escovar] I have always spoken in very critical terms  against  the DIEX. I have been told that nothing can be done about it.  There is general pessimism on this subject. The first thing that  you have to do is to identify the sources of corruption, because  not all officials in the DIEX are corrupt. I once asked the  members of the ministry trade union, who came to me and offered  their cooperation, to help me in cleaning up the DIEX. I wanted  to bring the members of the trade union into this job and give  them a motive for doing so. Of course, the sources of corruption  in DIEX do not like this, nor do they like computers, because  office automation, using computers, is an enemy of corruption.  It prevents officials from acting secretly.    DIEX needs cleaning up, organization, and automation. How  are  we dealing with the automation of DIEX during this period of  difficulties? I am studying the possibility of private  contributions and turning the DIEX into an independent agency  which could finance itself with its own resources. However, I  have not yet made a decision because I am still analyzing  whether this course of action is viable and what legal  difficulties there may be.    At the moment I have asked neighborhood associations to help  me to investigate DIEX. I am going to install two telephones in  the ministry to receive complaints from the public. The  telephone numbers will be made public soon. The person answering  the telephone in the ministry will have to give his name so that  the complainant will know whom to contact or to call again if  his complaint is not dealt with. That service is being  organized, and an announcement concerning it will be made  shortly. In DIEX we have to carry out a psychological revolution  to treat the public properly. I am going to send some experts to  tell people in DIEX that they should learn to say, "Good  morning," "with pleasure," and "please."    [Pimentel] Do you think that, beyond the matter of behavior  which you hope to change, the problem is also structural,  involving bureaucratic practices such as collecting money for  services rendered, gift giving in exchange for services, and  bribery?    [Escovar] It is true that in Venezuela the administration is  an obstacle course. And not only in the DIEX. This is a country  where it takes an effort to do anything. In the DIEX we have to  find out how many employees are not needed. We have to make a  personnel audit and find out which employees are involved in  corruption. This is something which is now being done. The other  task is to protect the decent and honest people who work there,  because at times those scoundrels represent the honest people,  silence them, and prevent them from doing their job. In this  area we are going to face the collective will of the ministry. I  am inclined to do that. We are going to see what the results  will be.    [Pimentel] Do you think that in this way you will be able to  control illegal and undocumented immigration which you have  criticized so much?    [Escovar] The DIEX is a fundamental instrument of national  sovereignty. Those activities are a crime of treason to the  fatherland. The official involved in that kind of activity can  be brought to trial. I have a clear position regarding the  matter of undocumented aliens. They cannot live in Venezuela. In  some cases there will have to be deportations, and I am ready  for that. Now, there are people who are illegal because they  have not been provided with the necessary documents, but they  are working. Cattle raisers in certain border areas have raised  that matter with me. However, the problem is in the illegal and  criminal element in the population. Venezuela has to have a  border policy but also a policy of selective immigration. In  this connection population policy has been confused with the  open door policy. Although there are no reliable statistics, I  believe that in Caracas there may be about two million  undocumented aliens. This is one of the open doors which must be  closed.    [Pimentel] And what about the DISIP?    [Escovar] We are doing the same thing with the DISIP. We are  reorganizing it. Gen. Rivas Ostos (the director) is doing a  quiet but efficient job. The DISIP is a state security police  service, but it does not have to be the Gestapo, nor does it  have to be violent or aggressive. This is a police force which  does not work for a political party or even the government, but  rather the Venezuelan state. That is the first thing that we  have to make clear. In Venezuela many people do not know that  the notion of a state is a permanent aspect of the national  community, while governments are transitory phenomena. In the  DISIP I am trying to apply the principle of identifying a  government official with the state. Previously, this  relationship was expressed in personal terms. The individual  official served interests which were not those of the Venezuelan  state. And I will not go on with this because a great deal is  already known about it and I do not need to repeat it.    [Pimentel] Regarding secret appropriations, when you were  attorney general, you said that these should be regulated. Do  you still think the same way?    [Escovar] The existing standards are the same. I contacted  the Office of the Controller General and asked it to suggest  what possible regulations might be applied. The important thing  to remember is that in the law establishing the Office of the  Controller General certain powers are given to the controller  general and eventually to the attorney general to exercise  supervision of the secret appropriations. Secret appropriations  cannot be a well from which funds can be drawn for all purposes.  Historically, it has been a means of providing welfare benefits  in exchange for certain favors. The appropriations for welfare  purposes do not have to be secret. They should be publicly  known. There could be further regulations on this matter.  <H5>  Standing Still on a Pile of Rubble </H5>   Escovar Salom answered at least three telephone calls on his  internal office phone in less than one hour. These were  government matters which he had to deal with from his office. He  said that he works 11 hours a day and, "as was the case in the  Office of the Attorney General," he takes no time off for lunch.  From time to time he adds to the volume of his recording of the  musical, "Gypsy," by playing his violin.    [Pimentel] The narcotics traffic is another problem  affecting  state security. How are you going to deal with it?    [Escovar] The narcotics traffic is a new element on the  scene, and you have to know how to deal with it. (He wanted to  clear up some misunderstandings on the subject.) It is not a  matter of making concessions. Rather, this is a very serious  matter which has to be considered. The geopolitics of drugs  presupposes international activities. States as such do not have  the means of dealing with a crime which is essentially  international in scope. Of course, there is a policy of  prevention and of education in dealing with drugs. However, the  basic problem is how to act from the executive point of view  against the narcotics traffic and related money laundering.    It seems to me that so far Venezuela has not had a clear  idea  of its position on this matter. More or less sporadic efforts  have been made. There are some cases in the courts, but nothing  coherent or coordinated has been done about the matter. Perhaps,  later on, it might become necessary to establish a special state  agency, a specialized and autonomous body, such as the DEA [Drug  Enforcement Administration] in the United States. One very  important aspect is the laundering of narcotics profits, but  here we have begun with the error of believing that this is not  going on. That kind of business has been growing almost in  public view, but no one realized it. There are even people who  are offended when you mention it. Why should we deny this fact  if it is a reality?    In passing Escovar presented some views which he had  previously expressed at the SECONASEDE conference [National  Development Conference]. He said that "some alleged patriots and  persons of ill will" quoted him as saying that Venezuela could  not take action on this matter. He said: "What I said -- and I  said so as minister of foreign affairs in about 1976 -- was that  Venezuela should keep clearly in mind that it is a small country  and should understand that this is what it is. It is better for  Venezuela to keep clearly in mind that it is an efficient and  productive country with political skills -- because political  skill is also one of our assets -- and that it has the  literature and the rhetorical skills of a large country. It is  very expensive to be a large country. Venezuela is not big  enough to be that."    He received a telephone call from someone very close to him  who apparently congratulated him on his appointment. The  minister purred into his phone, "That's a two-edged compliment  that you are paying me."    [Pimentel] Are you afraid of "burning out" in the Ministry  of  Interior Relations?    [Escovar] When I entered the Office of the Attorney General,  they said something like that. None of the people who called me  to pass on their greetings did so to congratulate me but rather  to express their condolences and to wish me luck. Neither did  public opinion expect much. I crossed the border between  skepticism and a certain amount of hope in November 1989, when I  began to visit hospitals. This was something different. However,  clearly enough, there are always jealous people and pessimists.  They are not always the same people, but they exist. They used  to say that visiting hospitals was not the job of the attorney  general.    They said the same thing when I began by winning certain  cases, not only the Carlos Andres Perez case on 11 March but  also other, previous cases. I knew at the time that Carlos  Andres Perez had called a very important businessman in Caracas  and told him that what I had presented in court was nonsense and  that the basis of my case was merely press clippings. He said:  "That is very difficult." A friend told me on 18 April 1993:  "Anyhow, I wish you success in that job, but this country is not  yet ready for that." Almost one month later, on 20 May, the CSJ  [Supreme Court of Justice] made a favorable finding on the  previous judgment against Carlos Andres Perez, who was then  president.    [Pimentel] Are we a country of pessimists?    [Escovar] I am used to that kind of pessimism. However, in  the ministry I am going to do the same thing and I have no doubt  that I will be successful. I am going to have many difficulties,  which already have begun, like the skepticism of the people.  Friends tell me: "Why did you leave your job as a lawyer  handling cases before the UN, with a salary of $14,000 a month  and with so many privileges, to come back and get involved in  this mess? You should have gone away and waited for a future  opportunity." But standing aside and waiting for the right  opportunity is like a man with new shoes who does not put them  on so that the soles will not wear out. If I speak up, I speak  up, as I did in the Office of the Attorney General. Everything  is very difficult now in Venezuela because we are still standing  on a mountain of rubble. That is what we have inherited, and we  have to work on that. There is nothing else to do."  <H5>  Biographic Details </H5>   Escovar Salom's biography states that he was the youngest  parliamentarian in Latin America in 1948 (when he was 21). He  was the youngest senator in 1958 (when he was 31) and the  youngest cabinet minister in 1964 (when he was 38). Since then  he began work in the executive branch of the government as  minister of justice. He was secretary general of the Office of  the President of the Republic (1974-75) and minister of foreign  affairs (1975-77) during the first term of President Carlos  Andres Perez. Then he was Venezuelan ambassador to France  (1986-89). Until February 1994 he was attorney general.    Now, as minister of interior relations, he is a member of  the  cabinet of President Rafael Caldera. His experience as one of  the drafters of the national constitution (of 1961) now in  effect and as titular professor of constitutional law seems to  him to be a good reason for expressing the view that  constitutional reform should be the result of a broad and also  harmonious consensus, because the constitution of 1961 "got away  from us." He said: "Because we wanted to draft a good  constitution in the sense of stability we moved too far toward  rigidity."    He suggests that reform should be oriented more toward the  way in which the national government functions, toward the  organic part of the constitution, and toward seeking  alternatives to political crises which end up in coups d'etat.  He firmly believes that the idea of holding a referendum to  recall a president is not a bad one. Everything depends on the  electorate's being clearly prepared to deal with the situations  which come up. He is not opposed to a dissolution of Congress.  He said: "In democratic countries this is a power which the  serving prime minister does not make use of every day. Except in  very serious situations, I consider that the electorate should  be consulted."</p>

			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Bond weakness returns and hits share prices - Market Report UK stocks suffered a further setback yesterday as European and US securities markets continued to grapple with the uncertain interest rate outlook. British government bonds fell heavily after sterling weakened against the German mark, and although London stocks bounced back from the day's lows, the closing picture was darkened by a 50 point fall in early dealings on Wall Street as more US banks raised prime rates. The session opened fairly calmly, with European markets at first taking a favourable view of a sharp rise in February M3 money supply in Germany. Later, however, opinions on the German money data changed and doubts were cast over the Bundesbank's chances of cutting its discount rate. Equities were overshadowed from the opening by news of a Pounds 651m rights issue from Allied Lyons to help fund its purchase of Pedro Domecq, the Spanish drinks group. Shares in Allied fell heavily, and the Footsie Index was also hit by a sharp setback in Wellcome after the interim trading statement was received badly by City analysts. Interest rate optimism continued to recede in London as investors digested the implications of the Retail Price Index news of the previous day. However, not all analysts were bearish; several leading brokers remained confident that base rates will be cut next month and urged fund managers to see the present shakeout in equities as a buying opportunity. The fall in the Footsie was held to around 20 points until the second half of the session when losses in government bonds were extended to nearly two full points at the longer end. The Footsie dropped to 3,111.8, a net loss of 43.5, as pressure from stock index futures cut into the blue chip stocks. Although bonds remained depressed, the stock market rallied, helped by encouraging post-results meetings with analysts at Sun Alliance and P &amp; O. Once again, the stock market escaped heavy selling, and it was the futures markets which took the brunt. The final reading showed the FT-SE Index at 3,121.7, with the day's fall reduced to 33.6 points. Traders again pointed out that the Footsie lacks a support level above the 3,080 area and is vulnerable to any selling pressure. Some institutional selling was reported yesterday but the day's Seaq total of 703.5m shares compared with 714.5m in the previous session. On Wednesday, retail, or customer business was worth Pounds 1.79bn, well up to the best daily average levels of the past twelve months. Institutions tend to make their immediate move in the futures markets, and trade the individual stocks when market prices are suitable. Some comfort was taken from the market's ability to rally, and also to show some resistance to the slide in the UK bond market. Analysts pointed to the steady flow of increased dividend payments from British companies, which was described as the more positive side to the pressures from economic recovery which are upsetting fixed interest markets. The clear signs of dividend and earnings recovery now coming through in UK company results was put forward as the arguement for buying equities at a time when the bond market has become a high risk arena. However, the markets this morning faces the March report on business trends from the Confederation of British Industries.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Conventional cooking tops. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Section 325(l)(2)(A) of the Act specifies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the Department must consider, for amended standards, those standards that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``achieve the maximum improvement in energy efficiency which the Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determines is technologically feasible and economically justified.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, the Department first considered the max tech level of efficiency,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> i.e., standard level 5 for amended conventional cooking top standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Of the standard levels analyzed, level 5 will save the most energy (3.04  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quads between 1996 and 2030). In order to meet this standard, the Department  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assumes that all representative classes of conventional cooking tops will have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reflective surfaces. Additionally, electric-coil cooking tops would have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> improved element contact, and gas cooking tops would incorporate reduced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> burner excess air, electronic ignition and sealed burners. It should also be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> noted that the design options for the representative classes are the same for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> levels 5, 4 and 3,_i.e., max tech,_ with the differences in those levels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> having to do with design options for electric smooth element cooking tops. At  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> level 5, the max tech level for all classes, electric smooth element cooking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tops require the use of induction elements. However, the payback at this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard level for electric smooth element cooking tops is 193 years, with a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $550 increase in life-cycle costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The Department therefore concludes that the burdens of standard level 5  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for conventional cooking tops outweigh the benefits, and rejects the standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> level.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The next most stringent standard level is standard level 4. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard level is projected to save 2.85 quads of energy. As discussed above,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the representative classes are still at their max tech level, while electric  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> smooth element cooking tops require the use of halogen elements. The payback  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at this standard level for electric smooth element cooking tops is 890 years,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with a $343 increase in life-cycle costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department, therefore concludes that the burdens of standard level 4  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for conventional cooking tops outweigh the benefits, and rejects the standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> level.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The next most stringent standard level is standard level 3. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard level is projected to save 2.68 quads of energy. As discussed above,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the representative classes are still at their max tech level, while electric  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> smooth element cooking tops are at the baseline. The payback at this standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> level for the representative gas and electric classes are 10.1 and 9.8 years,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respectively, which slightly exceeds half of the product life. Additionally,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Department is concerned about the longevity of the design option,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reflective surfaces, required to meet this standard level.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department therefore concludes that the questionable technology and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> economic burdens of standard level 3 for conventional cooking tops outweigh  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the benefits, and rejects the standard level.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After carefully considering the analysis, the Department is amending the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> National Appliance Energy Conservation Act-imposed 1990 standard for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conventional cooking top portion of kitchen ranges and ovens with standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> level 2 for conventional cooking tops. The Department concludes that standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> level 2 for conventional cooking tops saves a significant amount of energy and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is technologically feasible and economically justified.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There would be significant energy savings at this level of efficiency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During the period 1996&hyph;2030, these savings are calculated to be 2.54 quads  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of primary energy. In addition, the standard could have a positive effect on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the environment by reducing the emissions of NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  by 151,000 tons and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 30,000 tons, respectively, or by as much as 0.09 and 0.02 percent,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respectively, by the year 2030. Furthermore, the standard will reduce  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions of CO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  by 144 million tons, or 0.15 percent, over the forecast  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The technologies that are necessary to meet this standard are presently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available. The Department finds the level to be economically justified. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumer payback of this standard level is 7.0 years and 5.2 years for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representative gas and electric classes, respectively, or roughly one-third of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the 19-year product life. This standard lowers the life-cycle cost for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representative gas and electric classes by $66 and $6, respectively.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, the standard is expected to have only a slight reduction of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prototypical manufacturer's return on equity of 8.6 percent. Since this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard does not involve substantial redesign or retooling, the Department  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expects that it will not have negative impacts on smaller competitors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> June 15, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PREVIEW / CENTRAL AMERICAN SUMMIT;  </P> <P> LATINS TURN ATTENTION TO ECONOMICS  </P> <P> Pity Honduras. After sinking millions of foreign aid dollars into a dam,  Central America's poorest country finds itself rich in electricity but unable  to sell all the surplus.  </P> <P> Costa Rica, the region's most prosperous nation, is the logical customer. But  between buyer and seller sits Nicaragua, with a power grid frayed by neglect  and guerrilla sabotage.  </P> <P> As a result, much of the electricity Honduras exports simply gets lost  somewhere over Nicaragua. The Hondurans can charge only for what reaches Costa  Rica. Nicaragua is too broke to fix its lines or pay for power itself.  </P> <P> This waste of energy is a symptom of the physical and economic disintegration  of Central America during the last decade of civil strife. It is the kind of  problem the region's new leaders are eager to solve now that most of the  fighting is over.  </P> <P> For the first time in six summit meetings since the so-called Esquipulas peace  accord of August, 1987, the five Central American presidents who gather here  Saturday and Sunday will focus mainly on economics. Having ended the Contra war  in Nicaragua and coaxed the combatants in El Salvador and Guatemala to start  talking peace, they will ask how they can help each other grow out of the  poverty that fed those guerrilla conflicts.  </P> <P> The time is ripe. El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica have  installed elected civilian presidents in the last 12 months. These leaders  share a conservative, technocratic outlook.  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Background  </P> <P> As an ideological battleground, Central America got billions of superpower  dollars during the 1980s, only to suffer what a U.N. report calls "an  unprecedented social and economic crisis." Regional per capita income is down  20% from 1978, the report says, and two of every five people live in "extreme  poverty." Two million are refugees.  </P> <P> The hope of the 1960s, the Central American Common Market, barely functions.  Trade among the five countries has declined from $1.1 billion in 1981 to $600  million last year.  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Agenda  </P> <P> Regional agencies spawned by the Common Market have proposed an ambitious  agenda for the five presidents. It calls for reviving the market, moving toward  a single monetary system and setting up a joint "mechanism" to coordinate  development projects and seek outside aid.  </P> <P> "Central Americans ought to aspire to the total integration of this region as  an economic unit if we really want to move ahead," said Guatemalan President  Vinicio Cerezo Arevalo, the only one of the five Esquipulas signatories still  in office.  </P> <P> A more united Central America -- the isthmus was a single federation, ruled  from Guatemala, until 1838 -- is "something of a holy grail" for the region's  statesmen, a foreign economist noted.  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Obstacles  </P> <P> But the rhetoric masks the same contradictions that derailed the Common Market.  </P> <P> The market's trade barriers with the outside allowed El Salvador and Nicaragua  to develop nascent industries and export manufactured goods within the region.  Restoring such uniform protection could help them revive those industries,  largely idled by war.  </P> <P> Opposing such an inward-looking Common Market are Costa Rica and Honduras. They  lost the early race to industrialize, became burdened by huge trade deficits  and went their own way.  </P> <P> Honduras abandoned the Common Market and got by on heavy doses of U.S. military  and economic aid. Borrowing heavily from commercial banks, Costa Rica developed  export markets outside Central America to become the region's only 1980s  success story.  </P> <P> But Costa Rica's economic record is not as envied as its democracy -- the model  held up by its ex-president, Oscar Arias Sanchez, for the regional peace accord  that he drafted. The cost of Costa Rica's painful belt-tightening to overcome a  mid-1980s debt crisis probably exceeds what the more fragile neighboring  democracies can pay.  </P> <P> With Arias out of office, no one has stepped forward to lead the region.  </P> <P> "In the peace process, everyone had a sense that by agreeing to the Arias  rules, they would all benefit," said Albert Fishlow of the University of  California at Berkeley. "On the economic side, you're talking about trade-offs  between countries in terms of relative benefits from a new system. There is no  acknowledged broker."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Confrontation in Fatah Central </F> Committee Meeting; Abu-'Ala' Threatens To `Resign' Following  Hani al-Hasan Accusations"]    [Excerpt] Tunis, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Well-informed  Palestinian sources have told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the meeting  held by the Fatah Central Committee on 17 April evening under  Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat in the PLO headquarters in  Tunis, which was attended by Hani al-Hasan after a three-month  absence, was stormy and tense. The Central Committee members'  escorts who were outside the meeting room heard the heated  debates and arguments between Hani al-Hasan on the one hand and  Ahmad Quray' (Abu-'Ala'), Mahmud 'Abbas (Abu-Mazin), and Hakam  Bal'awi on the other.    The sources said that Abu-'Ala', director of the PLO  Economic  Department and head of the Palestinian delegation to the Paris  economic negotiations with Israel, lost his nerve, became angry,  and threatened not to go back to Paris. He violently threw the  file of the Palestinian-Israeli economic negotiations on the  table as an indication of his refusal to follow up this issue.    According to the same sources, a dispute raged between  al-Hasan and Quray' after the latter delivered the report on the  Paris negotiations and the economic situation, stressing the  importance of the achievements he had made. Al-Hasan's protest  was at the fact that this report was delivered verbally in a few  minutes. He pointed out that the head of the Israeli delegation  to the Paris negotiations "held a television seminar one day  before our meeting during which he briefed the Israelis on the  content of the Paris negotiations, highlighting the economic and  political achievements made by the Israeli side, especially with  regard to issuing a Palestinian currency, part of whose reserve  would be deposited in the Israeli Central Bank."    Al-Hasan said that "this very serious issue should not be  discussed in such a manner. The economic agreement with all its  stipulations should be put on the table and distributed to Fatah  Central Committee members in order to study it clause by clause."    Asked about his opinion of the economic agreement being  prepared in Paris, he said: "The intifadah aimed to sever the  economic link and demographic coexistence between the Israelis  and the Palestinians, while the economic agreement aims to link  the Palestinian economy with the Israeli economy."    In his remarks to Central Committee members, al-Hasan said:  "Based on the theory `tell me what your economy is, and I will  tell you what your policy is,' instead of the present  transitional phase resulting in the handover of the land and  economy, the economic linkage means that at the end of the  transitional phase there will be no independence, but, rather, a  Palestinian entity within an Israeli framework."

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>   [Text] Boris Yeltsin had a meeting with Ukrainian  President Leonid Kravchuk in Moscow today within the framework  of the CIS summit, in order to remove the tensions that have  developed around the Black Sea Fleet. The two presidents  discussed the possibility of resolving the issue in stages. The  first stage could be to relocate the fleets to different bases,  while the second stage could include setting up a base for  Ukrainian naval forces on the Black Sea coast. In Kravchuk's  opinion, the main problem is that there are no documents  regulating the stationing of foreign naval bases on the  territory of Ukraine.</p>

			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / Zambia minister quits to aid drugs probe Zambia's Foreign Minister Vernon Mwaanga resigned yesterday, saying he wanted to give the government time to investigate allegations of drug dealing by cabinet members, Reuter reports from Lusaka. Mr Mwaanga, 49, denied he was involved in drug trafficking or corruption scandals swirling around President Frederick Chiluba's beleaguered government. But he told a news conference: 'I want to inform the nation of my decision to stand down as minister of foreign affairs with immediate effect.' Mr Mwaanga said he wanted to give the government time to investigate allegations of corruption, drug trafficking, misuse of public funds and abuse of office by civil servants. His successor has yet to be announced. Zambia's leading western donors demanded an end to alleged high-level drug trafficking and corruption as a pre-condition for financial aid at a consultative meeting in Paris last month. Zambia already has a balance-of-payments financing gap of Dollars 96m (Pounds 65m) for 1994, which donors said they would not cover until the government rid itself of 'corrupt individuals'. Three 'clean' government ministers claimed last week that four of their colleagues, whom they did not name, were involved in drug dealing. Most of the deals were said to involve shipping highly addictive Mandrax sedatives from India, where they are made, to South Africa. A western diplomat described Mr Mwaanga's resignation as 'a welcome first step' but said it was not enough. Mr Mwaanga is a founder member of the ruling Movement for Multi-party Democracy. He entered politics in 1960 and served as a diplomat of the former United National Independence party government of Kenneth Kuanda and in various cabinet positions including finance and foreign affairs.</p>

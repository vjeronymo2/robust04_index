			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / Japan rejects targets on domestic market access ANY Japanese acceptance of numerical targets on access to its domestic market would automatically lead to managed trade and increase government interference in the economy, a senior Japanese official warned yesterday. Mr Noboru Hatakeyama, outgoing vice-minister for international affairs at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, made his comments as US and Japanese negotiators gathered for talks on a framework for subsequent discussions on issues such as government procurement and competition. The US is pressing Japan to adopt economic policies to cut its current account surplus from about 3.5 per cent of gross national product to about 1.5 per cent and to accept targets to measure its progress in opening its market to imports. Mr Hatakeyama said Japan had the lowest tariffs on imported industrial goods of any major economy, and added: 'If the US wants to increase imports of industrial goods swiftly, that can only be achieved by the Japanese government asking people to purchase what they do not want to buy.' It was Japan's view that any numerical targets to measure import penetration would be inevitably be used to put pressure upon the government to intervene in the market. Mr Lawrence Summers, the US Treasury undersecretary for international affairs, denied the US was seeking managed trade. Speaking in Tokyo on Friday, he said the US wanted to open up highly regulated areas of the Japanese economy as part of a programme for Japan to 'normalise its economic relations with the rest of the world'.</p>

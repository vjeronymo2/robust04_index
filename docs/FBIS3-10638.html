			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] Buenos Aires LA PRENSA in Spanish on 24  February published on page 5 a 900-word report on the reaction  of the Argentine banking sector to government decree No. 146  eliminating restrictions on foreign banks in Argentina.  Declaring itself "on a war footing" over the new decree, the  Association of Argentine Banks (Adeba) criticized the measure,  which opens up financial markets in Argentina and eliminates the  "principle of reciprocity." The association also prepared a  document urging the government to "reevaluate" the 21 February  decree. Adeba head Eduardo Escassany warned that an increase in  banks in Argentina would not cause interest rates to drop. He  asserted that "even though, in practice, reciprocity has never  been enforced," Argentina has just lost a "bargaining chip" for  negotiating on world markets. Former Central Bank President  Javier Gonzalez Fraga deemed the measure "unnecessary" and  "counterproductive," adding that globalization of the economy  should be a "two-way street."</p>

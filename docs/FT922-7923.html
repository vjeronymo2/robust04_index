			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Serb bid to evade EC freeze on assets THE Serbian authorities have been withdrawing assets from western banks, and from banks in Belgrade, the Serbian capital, in an attempt to circumvent further European Community sanctions. The EC has not yet drawn up any concrete measures to seize such assets, nor have central bankers received warnings or instructions to prepare for such a possibility. Nevertheless, more than Dollars 1.5bn has been taken out of Belgrade over the past six months, while assets held in the UK had decreased, western bankers and diplomats said yesterday. In Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, the Presidency building came under attack yesterday, with shells exploding nearby every 20 seconds, according to Mr Hajrudim Somun, an official inside. He said the Interior Ministry had also been hit. The largely Moslem Bosnian Territorial Defence Forces yesterday made a desperate attempt to break a siege which Serb militia, backed by the Yugoslav army, have imposed on the city for the past two weeks. General Lew Mckenzie, a Canadian commander of the UN peacekeeping forces, said Moslem forces tried to break out of the encirclement but the federal army 'massively retaliated'. Faced with severe shortage of food and medical supplies, the Bosnia militia yesterday were forced to open up a route out of the city, thus ending the fragile ceasefire announced by the Serb militia earlier in the week. Eye-witnesses said Bosnian militiamen battled against Serb irregulars between blocks of flats. One witness said: 'It is the worst street fighting ever.' Several mortar shells hit the Rainbow Hotel, which houses some 250 United Nations peacekeepers, wounding a member of the UN staff and setting ablaze 12 vehicles. Yugoslavia's assets abroad, not including assets held overseas by Slovene or Croatian banks, totalled Dollars 2.9bn up to December 1991. Claims on Yugoslav hard currency deposits held in the UK totalled Dollars 685m by the end of December - Dollars 582m held in foreign currencies, and the remainder in sterling. This represents a sharp fall from the previous quarter, when all Yugoslav assets in the UK totalled Dollars 1.1bn. The decline is partly related to the withdrawal of these assets, as well as moves by Slovenia and Croatia, who declared their independence last June, to protect their assets against Serbia, and the Serb-dominated National Bank of Yugoslavia. EC diplomats said yesterday further sanctions against Serbia were discussed by foreign ministers last Monday. There was no decision to freeze Serbia's assets, a British official said. Moves by the EC and the US to isolate Serbia have mounted over the past week in an attempt to apply pressure on Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic to stop the fighting in the war-torn former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Hercegovina. Serbia, and Montenegro, its ally, declared themselves the successor to the former Yugoslavia, but the EC, the US and the countries of eastern Europe have not recognised the new Yugoslavia. The EC withdrew its ambassadors from Belgrade on Monday and will exclude Yugoslavia from any discussions about Bosnia at the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe.</p>

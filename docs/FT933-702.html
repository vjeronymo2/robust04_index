			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Technology: Research stuck in the pork barrel - Technically Speaking IN 16th century England, farmers identified their pigs by their earmarks. Likewise, US federally funded research has for some years had small portions of funds 'earmarked' by powerful members of Congress to go directly to institutions in their districts. Now, a critical report by George E. Brown, democratic chairman of the House committee on science, space and technology, has revealed that the amounts of earmarked funds have leapt upwards to the point that they 'eat into the base programmes' that the nation relies on 'to fund our scientific enterprise'. Brown has been a lonely critic of the practice, which his fellow members prefer not to talk about. Now, he reveals that in the fiscal year 1992, Dollars 708m (Pounds 460m) of the Dollars 72bn spent on research was earmarked, almost double the amount the year before. In 1980 only seven awards were earmarked, totalling Dollars 10m. Since then, while some universities decry earmarking, a growing number of institutions have accepted it or even pay high-priced lobbyists to win large dollops of federal money without the hassle of raising matching funds or peer review. Brown reveals that Wheeling Jesuit College in West Virginia, with only 1,000 full-time students, got Dollars 21m in 1992, and notes that Senator Robert C. Byrd, chairman of the senate appropriations committee, is from West Virginia. Barons in Congress can legally require even the best-run agencies to award research funds to institutions which all parties know are unlikely to pass merit review. The universities receiving the most pork since 1980 have been Iowa State (Dollars 91.5m), University of Alaska (Dollars 91.2m) and Oregon Health Sciences University (Dollars 84.9m). Federal research managers may work closely with the university to draw up a passable use for the funds. This may lessen waste but also takes up time the managers need to devote to more important agency work. Or they simply write a cheque. They dare not refuse because 'to do so would incur the wrath of the appropriations committees, and that is not a price any executive department is fully willing to pay', Brown concludes. 'No effective checks on this power currently exist.' Except possibly embarrassment, a tactic Brown has adopted by publishing his report. It hits hard at hospital facilities to be built at 10 universities which were earmarked in energy research appropriations over four years. As a consequence, funding for the superconducting supercollider, the crown jewel of US high-energy physics, was cut. The amount diverted to medical facilities was Dollars 171.8m - or 60 per cent of the Dollars 282m withheld from the supercollider. This underfunding in turn caused schedule slips 'that, regrettably, contributed to the erosion of support' for the supercollider in the House. The House appropriations chairman, William H. Natcher, now favours limiting the practice of earmarking and has banned earmarks for the first time in the House version of the National Institutes of Health's budget. President Bill Clinton's science adviser, Jack Gibbons, is on record as being opposed to earmarks. With Brown's open criticism and Gibbons' stance, the betting has been that earmarks would be reduced in 1993. Until this summer, that is, when Clinton's five-year tax and debt-reduction plan seemed on the verge of defeat and his presidency became hostage to the demands of individual congressmen. Exactly what was promised to key members in return for their votes is not known. But Bill Sarpalius of Texas reportedly left a meeting with energy secretary Hazel O'Leary optimistic that a nuclear weapons lab in Amarillo, Texas, might expand - and deciding to vote as the president wished. Only when Congress finishes with the budget and its massive reports are published, will we know if 'pork' remains rampant, or if Brown is succeeding in turning off this source of gold for non-competitive universities.</p>

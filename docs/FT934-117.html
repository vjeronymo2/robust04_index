			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / South Africa's coloureds are key to National party hopes: Ruling party needs support of some of apartheid's victims It must rank as one of the stranger paradoxes of apartheid that the electoral prospects of South Africa's long-ruling National party now depend on those who were its victims: blacks, Indians, and especially the mixed-race 'coloureds' who share the Afrikaans language and other cultural traits with their former oppressors. For the party to reach critical mass in the all-race elections next April - the 20 or 25 per cent of the vote needed effectively to counterbalance an African National Congress government - it must win a majority of votes from the 3.2m coloureds. Opinion polls show negligible support for the NP among blacks (though fear of intimidation may affect replies); support among the 1m Indians hovers between 40 and 50 per cent; and while support from the 5m whites is volatile, and could rise once the party election machine enters top gear, latest figures (from the Human Sciences Research Council) give the NP only 28 per cent of whites. Ironically, given the fact that the NP had coloureds removed from the common voters' roll in the 1950s, polls reflect higher support from coloureds than whites. The same HSRC poll, taken in July, registers 44 per cent coloured support for the National party, against only 12 per cent for the ANC. So the battle is on for the coloured voter, especially in Western Cape province which will be one of only two of the nine new electoral provinces where blacks are not a majority. Coloureds are believed to be the majority in the Western Cape and in the Northern Cape province, though no one knows the true number of Africans living in huge squatter settlements near Cape Town. The Western Cape is central to NP strategy: it is the only province where the party has a chance of controlling provincial government, and many conservative 'Nats' see it as a bolthole for whites if black government goes wrong. The ANC is determined to deny the Nats this victory, and polls show a shift in support toward the organisation in recent months (but only from 6 to 12 per cent, according to the HSRC). But in Mitchell's Plain - a large coloured township outside Cape Town which the ANC must win to capture the Western Cape - ANC organisers admit they face an uphill battle. 'Racism is still very real among coloured people. Apartheid was very successful in that,' says Mr Claude Mallins, a young ANC campaigner in Mitchell's Plain, which was built to house coloureds forcibly removed from Cape Town's District Six in one of the most notorious evictions of the apartheid era. He highlights the irony that racism between coloureds and blacks is at least as potent as between white and black. 'People have fears about black domination, about what is going to happen to their houses, to their money,' he adds. Mr Siraj Karjieker, manager of the local shopping mall, puts it more bluntly: 'The man in the street is virulently anti-black. I say 'black' but they say 'kaffir' right out.' Mr Vincent van Breda, an articulate young ANC campaigner, believes the identity crisis of the coloureds - a race formed by blending white, black, Malay, Indian, Hottentot and Bushman - has much to do with this. 'In terms of world outlook, we are western European. But we walk around with this black skin. . . or not-so-white skin. Lots of us haven't worked through that tension yet. We live between the black and the white worlds. It's going to take years. . . decades. . . generations to unbundle this.' In the shopping precinct outside Mr van Breda's office, this confusion is readily apparent. Two young shoppers say they are certain to vote NP: 'When the National party was ruling the land everything was going well,' they assert. Asked how they can vote for their former oppressors, they reply 'it was (former President P W) Botha who oppressed us, it wasn't (President F W) de Klerk. He changed things.' The manageress of a local shop points to a recent case where black squatters occupied newly-built coloured homes - an act condemned by the ANC - and asks, 'Already they are moving into our houses so what will happen when they are in power?' Conversely, several local hawkers say they will vote ANC, support for which is clearly growing. But many more express lack of interest, saying they will not vote at all. While all polls indicate many undecided voters, some show up to half of coloureds will not vote. Mr Mallins predicts a close race in Mitchell's Plain. He thinks the fight against racism will be long and hard. 'But this is an African continent,' he says. 'In the end, we must learn to live together.'</p>

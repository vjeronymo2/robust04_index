			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Referendum on European constitution is required Sir, Joe Rogaly ('The right question time', May 10) supports the European Movement's call for a referendum on any major reforms that might emerge after the 1996 intergovernmental conference on political union. Yet he sees no need to examine the actual proposals on the grounds that Mr Major is unlikely to support them. This is a pity, for the European Movement's proposals are largely in line with the views of the European Parliament and those of the overwhelming majority of political leaders in other EU countries. If we in Britain are not to remain totally isolated from our partners on the future of European integration, a reasoned debate on the subject in this country would be in our national interest. The European Movement wants the European institutions to be more democratically accountable and thus narrow the yawning gap between them and the general public. That is why it recommends that all European legislation should be enacted in the open by exposing the secretive law-making of the Council of Ministers to public scrutiny and ensuring that all European laws and actions are subject to democratic approval by the European Parliament. A written constitution, defining the rights and duties of European citizens and specifying which of these are to be exercised by the European institutions, is surely the best way to make the European Union comprehensible to the public. Such a constitution could only become generally acceptable if it were approved by a referendum of all the European citizens. Ernest Wistrich, management board member of the European Movement, 37b Gayton Road, London NW3</p>

			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Lords rebuff taxman - Right to perks is upheld THE FUTURE of employee benefits was put on firmer ground this week because of a landmark ruling by the law lords. But it has come only at considerable cost: the need to take politicians more seriously. The case of Pepper vs Hart, which was settled in a lengthy statement on Thursday from seven law lords instead of the normal five, has safeguarded many employee benefits from additional tax in the short term. At stake was whether 10 masters from Malvern school should be assessed for tax on the difference between the reduced fees they paid for their own children and the average cost per pupil of attending the school. The teachers - led by John Hart, a senior master - argued that they should have been assessed merely on any difference between the reduced fees and the marginal cost of the fees - covering expenses such as books, food and laundry. The Inland Revenue had been arguing with the teachers since 1983 that the benchmark should be the average cost. Had it won, the implications would have stretched far beyond Malvern. Perks provided by thousands of other companies to their employees - particularly in London - would also have been affected. That would have included staff receiving subsidised travel or cheap food, using a company's sports facilities or club memberships, or buying goods from their employer at a discount if they worked for a manufacturer. The final House of Lords appeal has determined that the teachers' use of marginal cost should be upheld. That has caused considerable relief from tax experts and companies around the country. Many employers were delaying re-structuring their benefit programmes as they awaited the outcome. Some had threatened to simply scrap the perks on offer to staff rather than change them if the ruling found in favour of the Revenue. Others which have followed the Revenue's guidance already and structured benefits around average cost, will have to re-think their position. Some which use marginal cost - but where this cost exceeds average cost - will also be affected adversely. More fundamentally, there is still the risk that the Revenue - which had been confident of victory - will now try to introduce new legislation explicitly using average cost. It says it is considering its position. Next year, it has the luxury of two budgets in which it could make these proposals. Strict interpretation of the letter of the law in the 1976 Finance Act meant that Pepper vs Hart almost certainly would have been settled in the Revenue's favour. But in a remarkable break with tradition - with potentially huge consitutional implications - the law lords agreed to go beyond the strict letter of the law. They considered the intention of ministers when debating the bill before it was converted into legislation. Whatever the future changes in tax on benefits, ministers' speeches will have gained a new prominence.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> What factors place female adolescents at risk for ATOD abuse, sexually-transmitted diseases (STDs) including HIV/AIDS, early pregnancy/childbirth and single parenting, school dropout and delinquency, and poverty and un/under-employment? What strategies can be devised that will address these factors, and that will successfully reach out to young women not often targeted by traditional school, social service or medical programs? What prevention strategies will result in changes in attitudes and behaviors of young women with respect to their ATOD use and related problems, and how can we measure such outcomes?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This Announcement will support demonstration programs that seek to answer questions such as those above, and to develop, implement, document, evaluate, and disseminate information about comprehensive strategies to address and respond to the unique needs of female adolescents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Program Goals and Objectives:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The overriding goal of this program priority area is to demonstrate strategies that decrease ATOD use among female adolescents and promote optimal health at the individual, family, and community levels. More specifically, the goals are:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Primary Prevention:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To decrease (and delay) the incidence of ATOD use among female adolescents by:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Identifying and specifying methods to reduce factors in the individual, family and/or significant others, school, peer group, neighborhood/community, and society/media that increase young women's vulnerability to initiating ATOD use; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Enhancing factors in the individual, family and/or significant others, school, peer group, neighborhood/community and society/media that strengthen young women's resiliency and protect them against using alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Secondary Prevention:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To decrease the prevalence of ATOD use among female adolescents by providing appropriate early intervention strategies to female adolescents who have already initiated ATOD use or who have engaged in other problem behaviors which are associated with ATOD use, such as early sexual activity, truancy, or running away from home.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. To decrease the incidence and prevalence of negative outcomes associated with ATOD use among female adolescents by addressing risk factors that significantly contribute to these outcomes, especially childhood sexual and physical abuse. Related negative outcomes include early pregnancy and parenthood; HIV transmission and AIDS, and other sexually-transmitted diseases; adolescent mental disorders, including eating disorders, depression, and suicidal behaviors; school dropout; involvement in prostitution, delinquency, or violent behaviors that may lead to criminal justice involvement; and homelessness.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Target Population:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Where appropriate, applicants are encouraged to target the following populations who, traditionally, have been underserved: (a) Female adolescents, ages 10&hyph;21, not normally targeted by traditional school, social service or medical programs, such as young women who have dropped out of school or female adolescents in the work force.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Female adolescents who have been involved with the criminal/juvenile justice system;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Female adolescents with HIV/AIDS or other STDs, or those at especially high risk for these diseases;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Female adolescents with disabilities;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Female adolescents who are lesbian or bisexual;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) Female adolescents who have a current or past  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> history of physical/sexual abuse or incest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The applicant must clearly document that the target group chosen is at high risk for ATOD use by specifying the relevant risk factors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

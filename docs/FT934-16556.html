			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / World Trade News: White House lobbies carmakers over Nafta THE Clinton White House yesterday produced an impressive lobbying display, demonstrating that although the North American Free Trade Agreement may be down it can by no means be counted out. Called to the White House were the top executives of the big three US motor companies and dozens of their suppliers. After pep talks from Vice- President Al Gore, Treasury secretary Lloyd Bentsen and 'Nafta tsar' William Daley - put in charge of lobbying by President Bill Clinton - the executives were bussed to Congress to talk to wavering congressmen about the virtues of the pact. Along the way they were marched to press briefings, where they dutifully reported that they would be hiring new workers if the agreement was passed, but that jobs would be lost if it failed. Mr Robert Eaton, chairman of Chrysler Corporation, said that the Mexican car market would grow by 36 per cent between now and the year 2000. 'We're going to be in that market, I can guarantee you,' he said. 'If Nafta doesn't pass, we'll have to tool those vehicles down there.' Mexico requires motor companies to export two cars for every vehicle imported. This would end under Nafta. US trade officials say American car exports to Mexico would rise from 1,000 to 60,000 in Nafta's first year of operation. But the pact's opponents say US carmakers and their suppliers willl move production facilities to Mexico to take advantage of the cheaper labour.</p>

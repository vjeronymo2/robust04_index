			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Report on interviews with small and medium businessmen by </F> Virginia Perez Araoz, Gladys Delvalle, and Marcela Lachman;  place and date not given]    [Text]  <H5>  Four Questions For Small and Medium Business (SMB) </H5>   LA PRENSA has spoken with a group of small and medium  businessmen from various sectors. We posed four questions to our  interviewees, most of whom agreed in our succinct dialogues that  their companies are "defenseless," although almost none of them  would exchange stability and the convertible peso for anything.    As for the interest rates that they would consider optimum,  there was little agreement, except that the current rates are  unaffordable. While the most radical would like to see  international rates no higher than one percent, others would  tolerate 7 percent.    The questions were:    1) What do you think 1994 will be like for your sector and,  in particular, for your business?    2) What are the main competitive disadvantages that you face  as a sector and as a business?    3) Do you think that there will be affordable private credit  for small and medium business and what rate would be  "affordable" in your judgment?    4) If you had three wishes in economic policy, what would  they be?  <H5>  Peso Must Be Devalued </H5>   Jorge Mazza, Manager of Vilmax, a dye manufacturing firm  that  exports two-thirds of its output:    1) Our company is regarded as one of the 100 innovators, but  I think that it still has a long way to go.    The problem lies in the lack of responsibility and  efficiency  of the Argentine people. I feel that they do not do responsible  work and that they would rather be charming and "hustle"  everybody else.    2) What makes things hard for SMB is the exchange rate.  Argentine costs are very high, and the result is an expensive,  poorly made, inefficient product.    3) Loans would start to be granted if the government felt  obliged to see this happen. Many SMB's are going to disappear  unless they are helped. The tariff ought to be 5 or 6 percent.    4) Argentine costs that would enable us to compete  internationally. A devaluation is needed. Italy is an example  that ought to be kept in mind. They devalued the lira, and as a  result costs did not rise. Our currency could be devalued if we  did things in earnest.    Halt the indiscriminate economic liberalization, and control  and determine the usefulness of things entering the country.    Let us educate ourselves so that we do better work.  <H5>  Fine, But Without Anyone's Help </H5>   Omar Bacchi, owner of the Nogali cookie company:    1) I do not think that 1994 will be much different from  1993.  Support for small and mid-sized industry will remain grudging.  We can see the proof in what is happening with the federal  fiscal pact. Everything is happening there as if industry,  particularly SMB, did not exist.    In spite of the risk, my company is investing in technology  (to the extent of my potential and by going into debt).    2) One of my main competitive disadvantages on the domestic  market is having to convert my products and sales structure  quickly to reach other segments of the market amid a recession  and stiff competition.    On foreign markets, although we have the potential advantage  of being an agribusiness, we have all of the disadvantages of  the manufacturing sector in general and the lack of dependable  government support (which is only talked about).    3) I do not think that there is going to be affordable  credit, either private or governmental. The interest rate on  loans should be in line with anticipated inflation.    4) To have a recovery on the domestic market; to see a  genuine, dependable policy of support for SMB; and to see  "affordable credit" and "production revolution," among other  expressions, become more than just political slogans.  <H5>  SMB's Help the Banks </H5>   Carlos Rodriguez, manager of Transfrigo, a refrigerated  transportation firm:    1) 1994 is going to be a difficult, highly competitive year  because there is an ever-increasing supply of transportation  services, not only from freight haulers but also from the  railways, which are more efficient in private hands.    2) The main problem is the lack of credit for investment.  Having a place in the market means keeping up to date, and this  demands investment in technology.    Ground rules are needed. Up to now there has been no  specific  oversight of our industry. Only recently has the government been  performing the policing function that properly belongs to it and  begun considering the need for a transportation law that would  provide a basic frame of reference.    SMB's are the ones that have the most competition. Their  competitors are individual truck owners, who up to now have  shirked every obligation.    3) The banks are not helping SMB's, which are instead  helping  the banks. Interest rates should not exceed 7 percent a month;  they should be between 3 and 4 percent.    4) Maintain stability; undertake labor reform and revoke any  provision that violates free trade (regulations, fees); the  government should get the policy of external investments moving.  <H5>  A Clear-Cut Economic Policy </H5>   Mario Elkouss, managing partner of Longoni Electronics:    1) This year is not going to be the same all across the  electronics industry. For example, things are going to be bad  for telephones. The fact is that the country is seeing an  indiscriminate economic liberalization, which complicates things  for domestic firms, and even more so for SMB's.    On the other hand, I think that this is going to be a good  year for services companies.    I feel that 1994 is going to be a good year for Longoni  Electronics, as long as we work very hard.    2) The main disadvantage is the indiscriminate economic  liberalization. Industrial decrees have established a zero  tariff on many foreign goods entering the country.    One good example is transformers, which have been allowed to  enter the country tariff-free, and as a result domestically made  ones have disappeared. Our country now has only the spare parts  market left.    3) I do not think that private lending is possible. The  Central Bank has issued regulations mandating increasing  guarantees and interest rates for lenders. The ideal interest  rate should not exceed 1 percent a month.    The credit problem is serious for SMB's, which must  modernize  constantly by investing in top-quality machinery to compete with  big business.    The ones that get loans take many months to pay them back.    4) An economic policy. The government has to state clearly  what the ground rules are.    A recovery, inasmuch as without one there is very little  circulation of money and you have to wait until you are paid to  conduct transactions.    Good times for all sectors, not just my company.  <H5>  Advertising and Deals That Close </H5>   Gloria Lopez Lecube, owner of FM La Isla:    1) Growth in the sector will be in line with economic  growth:  4 or 5 percent a year. My company will likely continue growing,  because the advertising pie, which is increasingly selective,  will be divided up among those media that specifically represent  the interests of each sector.    FM La Isla is aimed solely at the employers and executives  with influence in essential decision-making. Also, we will have  new products, such as the managers of pension funds that need to  advertise to explain the advantages of the new system and  capture potential customers.    2) The services sector and, in the area of communications in  particular, my company are geared solely to the domestic market.  The main competitive disadvantage is the growth of information  pools in the print, radio, and airwave and cable television  media, which restrict the development of the independent media.    The only way to compete is with a media approach like FM La  Isla's, which aims at the stratum with high purchasing power and  serves a selective listening and advertising public.    3) There is a national and international trend towards  promoting SMB. An affordable rate to overcome the lending  bottleneck would be 12 percent. Another measure that makes this  year look better for SMB is the new law on business obligations,  which allows entry into a market that had been reserved, until  now, for big business.    4) Maintain growth, but make a qualitative leap called  development.    Tax relief for investment, once and for all, in order to  specify and speed up the capitalization of selected lines of  business.    Lower the political decibel level in order to meet the  challenge of the economy.  <H5>  Long-Term Credit </H5>   Ernesto Mario Dimov, owner of Dimov S.A., a garment  manufacturer that has its own brands and also operates under  international licenses:    1) We feel that 1994 will be a difficult year for our sector  because we anticipate a marked decline in consumption and a lack  of confidence about the credit to be given to customers in  general.    As for our company in particular, we feel that it will be a  good year nevertheless.    2) The unfair importation of items at dumping prices, with  underbilling and low tariffs in many cases, is perhaps our main  competitive disadvantage.    High financing costs make it impossible to achieve the much  talked about goal of lowering Argentine costs.    3) I do not think that we will have affordable private  credit  in the immediate future, inasmuch as our sector has practically  no access to the economic plan that the government is  implementing to help SMB. There is no lending support. The  really important thing would be to have the long-term credit  needed for expanded production so that we could plan and budget  for our activities over these same periods.    We think that it would be reasonable to provide loans at  preferential rates for domestic producers, with interest rates  two or three points over current world rates.    4) Imports at real prices, because although there have been  some tariff hikes, they are still not high enough.    A recovery, which is essential for continued progress in the  economic arena.    A long-term credit policy, which is indispensable if we want  to remain a domestic company.  <H5>  Laboratories: "Another Good Year" </H5>   Juan Roberto Dominguez, owner of Dominguez Laboratories and  vice president of the Cooperative of Argentine Patent Medicines  Laboratories (Cooperala):    1) We will have a year very much like 1993. We are going to  keep on growing, although there is going to be less and slower  improvement for small and medium industries there than for big  business. Large firms are going to continue absorbing smaller  ones, which cannot survive on their own.    Since our business depends largely on bringing in new  products (and the formalities for authorizing new patent  medicines have been speeded up greatly under Cavallo), this is  going to be a point in our favor.    1994 is going to be very promising for us as a business  because we have begun exporting and already have contacts with  Brazil, Uruguay, Paraguay, and Chile. We are selling two items  on the overseas market: Demospresin and A-acid.    2) Mercosur [Common Market of the South] concerns us from a  competitive standpoint, although it would not seem to be hurting  us as much as it is the big laboratories.    We cannot compete with the prices of an economy as large as  Brazil's or with the prices of local companies that manufacture  pharmaceuticals in their plants in Uruguay or Brazil and then  package them here.    3) I do not think that more affordable private credit for  SMB  is on the way. And today it is altogether unaffordable; I can  say that from my own experience.    The foreign supplier company can give me financing for drugs  because it has had me as a client for more than 50 years.    European equipment manufacturers, many of them Italian, are  giving buyers of their products four or five years to pay for  them, because their governments finance these loans as a way of  promoting exports.    The ideal rate would be the international rate, which almost  never reaches 1 percent a month.    4) Continued convertibility, because stability is linked to  it.    The passage of the labor laws in order to lower costs and  eliminate the chaos with gross earnings, among other advantages.    Clarification of the meaning of the patent medicines bill,  giving consideration to the proposal of certain laboratories  that, while not rejecting a patent law outright, want  intellectual property respected but without monopoly patents.  <H5>  A Difficult 1994 on the Way </H5>   Guillermo Gomez Galizia, a businessman in the health  services  sector and a full member of the Chamber of Medical Diagnostic  Institutions (Cadime) and of the General Economic Confederation  of the federal capital:    1) We anticipate difficulties in several sectors of the  economy and especially in the SMB sector. Many of them have been  unable to cope easily with reconversion; in contrast, those that  have managed to stay afloat are having a very hard time adapting.    The sectors involved in consumer goods and the services  sector have recorded a significant expansion in recent times,  leading to excess supply at present.    2) The main disadvantages for SMB's in general on the  domestic market are the inordinately high interest rates for  firms of this size. The tax burden falls most heavily on  production and consumption, not on income as in the developed  countries. We suffer from technological obsolescence, arising  mainly from these disadvantages. Services are expensive, which  boosts production costs. And in the case of companies tied to  regional economies, freight charges are uncompetitive because  the transport SMB's have the same overall problems.    3) As the profile of SMB's is redefined, there will be a  better chance of getting loans in the private sector as well. If  the definition of an SMB is a company with, on the average, more  than 200 employees, annual sales of over $15 million, or  production assets of over five million pesos, then a great many  are going to be left out.    As for the interest rate, if we have inflation indices like  those in the developed countries, it should be in line with them.    4) Maintain the stability that has been achieved; take  immediate steps to grow and create jobs; establish mechanisms so  that SMB's can take full part in the economy and thus facilitate  its democratization.  <H5>  Efforts at Reconversion </H5>   Rolando Pietrantueno, chairman of the Argentine Industrial  Council (CAI) and a businessman in the metalworking sector:    1) and 2) The manufacturing industry has been engaged in  intensive reconversion since the economy was opened up through  the convertibility plan, this being part of the policy behind  it. The result was immediate price competition between imported  and domestic goods.    Small and medium industry found itself at a clear  disadvantage in achieving the goal as fast as was required and  without "anesthesia." It made an enormous effort to cut its own  internal costs but was severely restricted by external ones,  which can be summed up as the so-called "Argentine cost," which  includes fiscal policy, energy rates, ports, communications, the  workmen's compensation law, and fiscal labor costs.    To this we can add the genuine difficulty of obtaining  credit, which is an essential tool for bringing in the necessary  technology to improve productivity and replenish the working  capital that was lost as a result of hyperinflation.    3) Affordable credit will probably not be available until a  solution is found to two central problems restricting it: a  system of guarantees that is streamlined and dynamic enough to  overcome this fundamental restriction, and project appraisal.    4) Maintain the stability that has been achieved; sustained,  equitable growth that safeguards jobs and output; human beings  should be regarded as the hub of the system and as the sole  beneficiary of all economic activity.</p>

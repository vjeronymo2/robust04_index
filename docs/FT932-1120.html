			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Waigel cancels French talks after Paris urges rate cut MR Theo Waigel, German finance minister, yesterday pulled out of a top-level meeting booked for today with Mr Edmond Alphandery, his counterpart in the Paris government, after the French minister criticised the Bundesbank's 'restrictive' interest rates policy. Mr Alphandery said on radio that he had called the meeting on his 'own initiative' and hoped to use it as a forum for 'a joint discussion of the conditions for a concerted reduction in French and German rates'. He urged Germany to speed up cuts because Europe was 'suffering from overly restrictive monetary policies, notably the unduly restrictive German policy'. The Bonn Finance Ministry claimed the routine meeting of the Franco-German economic and finance council had been postponed because of pressure of work on Mr Waigel. Officials said it was quite normal for dates to be rearranged at short notice. But Mr Alphandery's remarks touched a sensitive spot at a particularly sensitive time. Mr Waigel is preoccupied with preparing and sounding out opinions within the coalition and parliamentary groups on a crucial package of government spending cuts. He is under heavy pressure from the Bundesbank to produce and push through a package that will convince the central bank and foreign exchange markets that Germany's fast growing public sector deficits can be brought under control. The Bundesbank, which was to have been represented by its president, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, at today's meeting, appears increasingly willing to resume rate reductions to help boost the economy. But it is constrained by the recent instability of the D-Mark, and was unlikely to have taken kindly to Mr Alphandery's tone. The French minister's remarks reflect France's growing assertiveness as the franc has strengthened against the D-Mark. French official short-term rates fell below those of German levels this week for the first time in 26 years. Yesterday's suggestions of co-operation were dismissed as 'nonsense' by the Bonn Finance Ministry. Closing ranks, its counterpart in Paris said postponement of the talks was perfectly normal and that there was no misunderstanding between the countries. Currencies, Page 29</p>

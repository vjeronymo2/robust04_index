			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Extra Eurostar trains to run Extra Eurostar trains will run through the Channel tunnel to Paris in the Christmas and new year period, it was announced yesterday. European Passenger Services, the UK arm of Eurostar, had been planning to increase the number of services to and from London's Waterloo station in late January but it said that high demand meant that it would run extra trains before then. Mr Richard Edgley, EPS managing director, said: 'Barely a month after the public launch, many trains are . . . running virtually full.' The additional trains will be a 5.15pm Waterloo to Paris service and a 7.07pm Paris to London service on December 16, 23 and 30 and on January 6 and 13. EPS will run a 4.53pm London-Paris and a 7.07pm Paris-London service on December 18 and January 8 and 15. In addition, there will be a 12.53pm London-Paris and a 7.07pm Paris-London service on January 20.</p>

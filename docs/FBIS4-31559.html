			<p>BFN     [Text] The new government will also have members who have  already gained experience in the Miklos Nemeth government, said  Imre Szekeres, [executive deputy chairman of the Hungarian  Socialist Party, MSZP], speaking to the "Napteve" program. At  the same time the MSZP executive deputy chairman added that  those younger experts and politicians who have only recently  become known in the MSZP will also be considered in the course  of the distribution of portfolios.

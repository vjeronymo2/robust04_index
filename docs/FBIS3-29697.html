About 500 Cambodian Government soldiers seized a Khmer Rouge  stronghold near the Thai-Cambodian border yesterday morning and  were later able to seize the camp after attacking it with heavy  shelling. Some of the Cambodian forces allegedly intruded into  Thai territory at An Ma Pass and later occupied a Thai military  base about 50 metres from the common border.    The Cambodian troops earlier refused to pull out of the  base,  claiming they wanted to wait until they were able to clear  landmines on the Cambodian side. They later agreed to withdraw  after a tough stand from the Thais. During negotiations, a  Cambodian soldier was killed when he stepped on a landmine.    A Cambodian soldier said the Cambodian government planned to  launch large-scale offensives against Khmer Rouge strongholds  this dry season. About 100 shells reportedly landed on Thai  soil during fighting yesterday morning but there were no reports  of casualties or damage to Thai property.</p>

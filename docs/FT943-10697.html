			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / Government Bonds: Mixed reaction to fall in US housing sales US Treasury bonds were mixed yesterday in spite of news of a sharp contraction in the housing sector. At the close, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  1/16 at 86 5/16 , with the yield rising to 7.397 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was up  1/16 at 100 9/32 , to yield 5.956 per cent. The initial reaction to the day's economic data was decidedly positive. Bonds across the spectrum pushed solidly higher after the Commerce Department announced that sales of new single-family homes had slumped 14.1 per cent in June to an annualised rate of 591,000, the lowest level in two years. Analysts had expected a more modest decline to an rate of 700,000 homes. Most economists agreed that the downturn was powerful evidence of the impact of the Federal Reserve's moves to tighten credit conditions in the first half. The report therefore supported a scenario which sees the central bank delaying its next move to lift interest rates. At the same time, the development reassured fixed-rate investors that the economy was slowing enough to allay fears of inflation. The market failed to sustain its forward momentum, with many retail accounts hesitant to assume new positions ahead of Friday's critical data on employment. As a result, the early gains evaporated, leaving bond prices near their opening values. Later in the session, the long end of the yield curve dipped into negative territory, as the Johnson Redbook Service reported retail sales last month had risen 0.3 per cent from June's level. UK gilts gained nearly two points at the long end of the yield curve, cheered by the Bank of England's quarterly inflation report in which the Bank indicated that inflation pressures remain subdued. After rallying throughout the morning, partly on Japanese buying overnight, gilt prices received another lift from the report, which was released in the afternoon. The long September gilt futures contract on Liffe rose two point to 103 9/16 . The long end of the market was further supported by technical factors in the futures market, where the break of resistance around 102 on the September contract triggered further buying, traders said. Moreover, dealers reported purchases by overseas investors, notably in east Asia and the US. Italian bonds also staged a recovery, boosted by heavy switching out of Spanish bonds and a general improvement in market sentiment. 'Prime Minister Berlusconi's decision to address the conflict of interest between his business and political interests has led to a general improvement in sentiment,' said Mr Ken Wattret, international economist at Midland Global Markets. The September BTP future on Liffe was up 1.21 point at 102.61 in late dealings. French bonds rose in largely futures-led dealings, with the September notional bond future on Matif gaining 0.80 point to close at 118.06. However, some of those gains may be erased as traders start building up short positions ahead of Thursday's monthly bond auction. The Treasury will auction between FFr19bn and FFr21bn 6.75 per cent bonds due 2004, 8.5 per cent bonds due 2008 and 6 per cent bonds due 2025. German bonds also firmed, with the September bund future on Liffe rising by 0.36 point to 94.16. However, traders said these were not backed by cash buying from investors. Germany's debt liquidation fund (Kreditabwicklungsfonds) today will sell one-year zero-coupon paper via the Bundesbank. 'With the advent of money market funds in Germany, the issue should go quite well,' said a bund dealer.</p>

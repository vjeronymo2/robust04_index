			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / Dare Wigan: racing writer: Obituary DARE WIGAN, who has died in hospital following a stroke, wrote a daily racing column for the Financial Times and was a notably successful racehorse breeder. He was 76. His racing column appeared for 11 years from the mid-1960s, and he contributed to The Observer, Country Life and other publications. In the second world war he served with the Coldstream Guards. He was a gentle man, always courteous and modest. In racing and horse-breeding circles he was known for the West Blagdon Stud in Cranborne, Dorset, which he ran with his wife Dawn. Although small, averaging only four breeding mares, the stud produced a stream of winners from its foundation mare, Pelting. Pelting had 14 foals. Twelve appeared on the racecourse and all were winners. West Blagdon Stud achieved the top foal price at the leading Newmarket bloodstock sales on five occasions, an outstanding performance for a small enterprise. Wigan left four children, one of whom, Dominic, took over his father's FT column for a number of years. Another, James, is a bloodstock agent.</p>

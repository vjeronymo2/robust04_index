			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Spouse's career 'limits postings' LOSS OF a spouse's career is the reason most commonly given for employees turning down a posting abroad, a pan-European survey on expatriate management says. In spite of the extent of the difficulty, only a minority of companies in the survey sought to address the problem formally - for example by offering financial compensation for loss of a spouse's income. The survey, by Price Waterhouse, the management consultancy, examined compensation packages, benefits and allowances offered to expatriate workers by more than 200 companies based in 13 European countries. Price Waterhouse said that a well-administered expatriate workforce was an important element in the successful growth of a business overseas and the survey highlighted the ways companies were tackling issues. It said there were still significant barriers to the free circulation of labour - with pension portability one of the most important. The main findings of the survey included: Children's education was a significant reason for turning down expatriate assignments. Career risk was the third most common reason for reluctance - with employees fearing that they would be 'out of sight, out of mind'. One fifth of companies had no dedicated member of staff with responsibility for the management of the expatriate workforce. Of companies surveyed, 37 per cent did not pay a financial incentive to encourage employees to accept and complete expatriate assignments. More than half the companies did not offer any financial compensation to the expatriate for loss of state benefits, such as child allowance.

			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Russia warned to respect borders The US and Germany issued clear warnings to the new Russian government at the weekend not to seek to create any 'spheres of influence or interest' beyond its borders. Both Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany and Mr William Perry, the new US defence secretary, spelt out their deep concern at any moves by Moscow to revive a nationalistic foreign policy in the former area of Soviet influence. They also promised to do everything in their power to support reform in Russia, including both economic reform, and integrating the military. Mr Perry revealed plans for the first joint US-Russian military exercise, to be held by the US 3rd Infantry division, and the Russian 27th Motorised Rifle Division, in the Volga region next July. Both men were speaking at the annual Munich conference on security, where the debate over the future of the Nato alliance was dominated by concern over developments in the former Soviet Union. Chancellor Kohl expressed confidence that President Boris Yeltsin 'will not listen to those who call for Russia to adopt a nationalistic or even imperialist policy'. The Russian leader had confirmed this in a letter in the past few days, he said. However he underlined his concern at recent Russian statements suggesting a return to a nationalistic foreign policy. 'We all know that in Russia there are deeply-rooted fears of encirclement and isolation, and not only in military circles,' he said. 'Nato must take these fears seriously. . . if it wants to create a wide-ranging security order for the whole of Europe.' He said Nato's policy was aimed at 'a real and stable partnership'. He added: 'In return, we expect Russia to continue a foreign policy marked by constructive participation in solving international problems.' The Helsinki Final Act called for 'unqualified respect for the sovereignty and integrity of all nations' which 'must be adhered to unequivocally by Russia'. He said: 'Above all, Russia must foster trust particularly among its neighbours through its own action. Thoughts of creating spheres of influence or interest would not be compatible with this.' Mr Perry warned that Russia was undergoing an internal transformation which 'surpasses even that of the Russian revolution of 1917'. It was natural for Russia to have an interest in the well-being of Russian-speaking minorities in the former Soviet Union, he said. But he warned: 'If Russian forces operate beyond Russia's borders, they must do so in accord with international law. Russia's legitimate concerns with stability on its borders must not be dealt with by relying on the old Soviet practices of intimidation and domination, or by undermining the sovereignty and independence of Russia's neighbours, whether their independence is old or new.' He urged Nato allies to act swiftly to put their plans for partnership with members of the former Warsaw Pact into effect. 'If Russia hews to a course of internal reform, respect for its neighbours' independence, and co-operation with the west, Nato will continue to evolve in the direction of maximum inclusiveness,' he concluded. 'If, however, reform in Russia falters, Nato will be there to provide for the allies' collective defence.'</p>

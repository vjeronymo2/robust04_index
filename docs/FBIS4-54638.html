			<p>BFN     OFFICE FOR PRIVATE BALANCE SHEETS: An office to review the  balance sheets of private individuals has recently been created  at Shkoder Municipality. This office will verify the profits of  private individuals and will prevent their abuse regarding state  obligations by presenting false balance sheets to the Tax  Department. Many private firms and enterprises have ensured  illegal profits in this way. Although over 100 private firms  and enterprises are operating in Shkoder, only 20 of them have  so far presented their balance sheets to the newly-created  office.

Gabriel Lasku, director of the  Northern-Central Regional Agency in Lac, stated that this year  the European Union (EU) will provide credits of 3 million ECU to  stimulate the transition from small to medium enterprises.  Credits of $10-15,000 were granted to small enterprises last  year, while this year the credit limit will be raised to $30,000  for medium enterprises. The credits for this year will be  distributed to all SME Foundation agencies in Albania in 1994,  with more rapid distribution in the second half of the year.  The less developed areas, such as those in the far north, will  be given preference in the distribution of credits. The number  of people to be assisted this year will be greater than the 15  who benefited from the program last year. (Tirana ATA in  English 1014 GMT 30 Mar 94)    EUROPEAN COMMISSION GRANT: An EU spokesman said that the  European Commission has proposed that the European Union grant a  financial assistance to Albania and Moldova for economic reform  programs. The European Commission proposed 35 million ECU aid  for Albania to resettle its balance of payments. To be  effective, the aid should be approved by the European Parliament  and the EU Council of Ministers. Last year, Albania was given  the first aid of this kind worth 140 million ECU. (Tirana ATA  in English 1204 GMT 31 Mar 94)    FUEL PROJECTS: The Mining and Energy Ministry reports that  190 projects for the construction of fuel stations are held for  approval, following adoption by the government of the Law on Gas  Stations. Hill Mehilli, specialist in the Hydrocarbons and  Energy Department, told ATA that out of 190 projects that have  so far been approved, some 100 of them are under construction,  44 have been constructed, and 40 are already functioning.

(Tirana ATA in English 1007 GMT 2  Apr 94)    ITALIAN JOINT VENTURE: The Albanian-Italian joint venture  Sando-Co. was recently set up in Kucove. This joint venture is  a result of the cooperation of the Detergent Factory in Kucove  and an Italian company located in Milan. Thus, the production of  detergents has increased to 800 tonnes per month, compared to  200 tonnes in the previous period, which was due to the lack of  raw material and the rise in detergent imports. Fitim Malaj, the  Kucove factory's director, told an ATA reporter that "in May  this year we expect to have a monthly rise of 300 tonnes. The  quality of the material we produce and the price, which is 30-40  percent lower than the imported one, make us hope for the rise."  The Italian side will provide other equipment, spare parts, and  a large boiler, as well as organizing the sale on the domestic  market. (Tirana ATA in English 1020 GMT 3 Apr 94)    MERCHANT FLEET SHIPS AUCTIONED: The first eight merchant  fleet ships have recently been put on auction. The Durresi,  Liria, and Apolonia are among the ships that have been put up  for auction. The auction will continue with 11 other ships.  The first phase of the ships' privatization will end after the  11 ships are sold. Some six high tonnage ships are expected to  be sold in the second phase. The Durresi ships will be  privatized based on a recently compiled study that will give  priority to the fleet workers. In cases when any of the workers  will take possession of a ship, the fleet will guarantee them a  one-year term contract, with the right to renewal. (Tirana ATA  in English 1022 GMT 3 Apr 94)    MODULAR CONSTRUCTION BEGINS: The construction of modular  building units has begun in Shkoder on an experimental basis by  a joint Albanian-Italian venture. The System- plast factory  intends to use a process that will combine two sheets of  galvanized steel with a core of thermal insulation. The  material for the different size units has been furnished by the  Italian partner. The units will be used as kiosks, tourist  accommodation, petrol stations, and other purposes. The units  produced by the joint venture in Shkoder will compete with  imported units due to their comfort and attractive appearance.  They are available with excellent lighting and sanitary  systems. (Tirana ATA in English 1205 GMT 4 Apr 94)    TEXTILE MILL RESUMES PRODUCTION: After a suspension of  several months, work has recently resumed in the Textile Mill in  Tirana. The mill engineer told ATA that the mill is operating  with only one shift, with approximately 1,000 workers. The  average salaries the workers are expected to get this year will  increase over 30 percent as compared to the average level of  payments. The specialists say that the mill has undergone a  large scale of amortization. Thus, efforts are being made to  establish contacts with various firms for investments in this  important project of the textile industry. The mill's  privatization process will include its other factories of  thread, woolen textiles, velvet, light clothing, and other  linen. For many years the mill was named after Stalin, but  after the democratic movements in Albania four years ago, its  name changed simply into the Textile Mill. (Tirana ATA in  English 1015 GMT 10 Apr 94)    EGYPTIAN FIRM BEGINS CONSTRUCTION: The Egyptian ambassador  in  Tirana reported that the powerful Egyptian firm Cato Aromatic  will soon start to construct five food factories in Vore, near  Tirana. The factories will produce cheese, macaroni, olive oil,  and some cosmetics. Cato Aromatic came to Albania a year ago.  The ambassador stated that the company has concluded the first  stage of the project, the drainage system and land leveling.  (Tirana ATA in English 1033 GMT 11 Apr 94)    SHAMPOO FACTORY STARTUP: The Gjirokastra Company recently  produced the first two tonnes of shampoo that was proved to be  of the same quality as that of the Johnson branch in Germany.  After receiving the packing boxes and labels, ordered to be  made abroad, the factory will soon mark its own products. The  factory will have branches in Tirana, Vlore, and Shkoder.  Robert Asqeriu, company's president, told ATA that the factory  will produce detergents and cosmetics in the future. (Tirana  ATA in English 1202 GMT 13 Apr 94)    CELLULAR PHONES: Cellular telephone, one of this century's  achievements, will be installed in Albania as well. In an  interview with RILINDJA DEMOKRATIKE, Minister of Transports and  Telecommunications Fatos Bitincka stressed that the cellular  telephone will be installed along with the traditional telephone  network, thus contributing to a further modernization of  telecommunications in Albania. Regarding the tender on the new  facility, Mr. Bitincka said that they intend to complete the  selection of offers within May or June, thus leaving enough time  to work for the installation and install the cellular telephone  by the end of 1994 or in early 1995. The number of telephone  subscribers ranges from 3,000 to 5,000, but the new system will  have greater possibilities to increase the number of  subscribers. Both foreign and Albanian firms have so far been  registered for the tender. Bitincka stated that the new  telephone network is expected to cover 70 percent of the  country's territory, giving priority to coastal and touristic  areas. (Tirana ATA in English 1019 GMT 14 Apr 94)    AUSTRIANS TO RESTRUCTURE BANK: Erbert Stefic, president of  one of the biggest Austrian banks, Raiffeisen Zentral Bank,  declared before Austrian reporters that this bank will soon  carry out a complete restructuring of the Albanian Bank of  Agriculture, sources from this bank with its headquarters in  Tirana told ATA.

(Tirana ATA in English  1026 GMT 14 Apr 94)    BANK GOVERNOR SPEAKS IN ROME: A meeting between  representatives of the Italian-Albanian Bank and some 300  entrepreneurs, mainly from the Rome province, has been recently  held in Rome. The purpose of the meeting was to acquaint the  Italian entrepreneurs with the possibilities of investments in  Albania. Dylber Vrioni, governor of the Albanian Bank, took the  floor at the meeting and mentioned several good existing  priorities, such as the little geographical distance between  Albania and Italy, the young age and cheap cost of the labor  force, their training and education, and the open and liberal  legislation for foreign investors. Mr. Vrioni also mentioned  the building industry, transportation, tourism, and agriculture  as the most profitable fields for investments. Many Italian  entrepreneurs, including representatives from Coca Cola and  Siemens, discussed at the meeting. The Siemens representative  told those participants that Albania has greater possibilities  for Italian investors than any other east European country.  Such activities will continue to be held in Bari, Milan,  Ancona, and Trieste. (Tirana ATA in English 1025 GMT 14 Apr 94)    EU DONATION FOR ENTERPRISES: Founded in 1992, the SME [Small  &amp; Medium Enterprises] Foundation supports and encourages free  initiative among the Albanian businessmen, who have just started  their activity. The foundation, financed by the PHARE PROGRAM  [Economic Reconstruction Aid for Poland and Hungary], whose  member Albania is since 1992, has given credits worth 1.1  million ECU for 152 cases. The EU has approved credits worth 3  million ECU and some 1.5 million ECU as technical assistance to  the SME Foundation for the period 1994-1995. The program  attaches priority to the manufacturing of goods, small  factories, and the transition from small private enterprises to  medium ones. So, the goal is to set up a new economic platform,  the main part of which is occupied by agro-industry,  craftsmanship, and small tourism, thus creating favorable  conditions for investors. Some 200 Albanian different  enterprises have been created so far. (Tirana ATA in English  1011 GMT 16 Apr 94)    ALBANIAN-ITALIAN OIL VENTURE: An agreement has been signed  for the creation of an Albanian-Italian joint venture named  "Bertoli." Rakip Iljazi, the enterprise's director, told ATA's  reporter that the enterprise will start its production in the  second six months this year and will mainly produce olive and  vegetable oil. Later, it will also produce soaps, apart from  the installation of a milk production line. For the Albanian  side, the agreement was signed by Minister of Agriculture and  Food Hasan Halili and for the Italian side, by Rudolfo Bertoli.  (Tirana ATA in English 1012 GMT 18 Apr 94)    NUMBER OF VEHICLES INCREASING: Compared with 1992, the  number  of vehicles circulating in Albania has doubled, while the  situation of roads has remained the same or even worse. Based  on these facts, the parliament decided to use 70 percent of the  income levied from fines on traffic violations to improve the  situation in this sector. The growing funds will be used to  provide the traffic police with sophisticated means to prevent  accidents. (Tirana ATA in English 1204 GMT 19 Apr 94)    GLASS FACTORY RESUMES PRODUCTION: The Glass Factory in  Kavaje  resumed production on 18 April. This was made possible due to  the funds provided by the Enterprise Reconstruction Agency,  which reconstructed four factory workshops, such as that of  glass production, packing, and glass articles for every day use.  The factory stopped its production due to old technology on  July 1990 and later due to the economical difficulties of the  transition period. Work has been going on for several months to  make the operation start again. Glass products made in Albania,  such as glass windows and articles of every day use, will soon  be present in our market. All demands for glass products have  so far been met by import and sometimes with high prices.  (Tirana ATA in English 1810 GMT 19 Apr 94)    MORE FOOD: The Veterinary Office in Tirana municipality  reports that during the first quarter of this year, the capital  has been provided with 42,861 quintals of meat of various kinds,  7,400 quintals of sausage, 16,855 quintals of cheese, 1,250  quintals of powdered milk, and over 20 million eggs. Along with  these imports, local food products, such as fresh meat, sausage,  curd, cheese and other products have also been traded. At  present, every Tirana citizen consumes on average four times  more meat and its by-products, two to three times more cheese,  two times more eggs, and 1.7 times more milk than during  1980-1991. The increase of food articles in the market has been  accompanied with the increase of the number of shops from 80 to  over 220. (Tirana ATA in English 1209 GMT 20 Apr 94)    NEW AIRLINE SERVICE: The national company, Albanian  Airlines, which has been operating for the past two years, has  recently added Bologna to its schedule and will start a new  service to Skopje in FYROM before the end of April. Founded as  a joint venture with the Austrian company Tyrolean Airlines,  Albanian Airlines initiated its service with flights to Zurich,  Rome, and Munich. The company has recently concluded an  agreement with Delta Airlines, which will enable it to provide  services to various U.S. states. The airline's management is  mainly Albanian and Canadian, and the fares are favorable for  Albanians. Feliks Baci, the company director, said to ATA that  "in the future we plan to introduce larger and faster  turbo-powered aircraft, and in May we will introduce flights to  Istanbul as well." (Tirana ATA in English 1212 GMT 23 Apr 94)    FOREIGN TRADE EXPANDING: The economic opening of Albania is  evident in the increase and expansion of trade activity with  almost all countries in the world. Its export indexes for 1993  amounted to 11.344 billion leks, and the highest level was  registered in October last year, to the tune of 1.350 billion  leks. The value of imports in the previous year was 58.177  billion leks. If we compare the export of certain products, such  as minerals, chemicals, plastic materials and their by-products,  it emerges that their value is about 2.5 times lower than the  value of the import of the same articles. The export of  electricity is worth nearly 492 million leks, that of tobacco  about 650 million leks, and the import of cigarettes is about  299 million leks. The export to countries of Eastern Europe was  1,945.383 billion leks, while goods worth 44,577.827 billion  leks were exported to European Community member countries. To  the OECD member countries, the commodities exported from Albania  have been to the amount of 48,055.056 billion leks and to East  European countries 8,276.363 billion leks. (Tirana ATA in  English 0800 GMT 24 Apr 94)    COOPERATION WITH GERMANS: The interest of German companies  to invest in Albania has been increasing. Since 1992, many  Albanian-German joint ventures have been created in Albania. The  "El Frigo," "Transalbania," "Gerberc-Butrint II," "Albania Bau  Handel ShPK," "Arta" have an initial capital worth $5.812  million, of which $5.553 million invested by German companies  and $259,000 by Albanian companies. The German companies are  taking special interest in the energy and mining sectors.  Agreements are expected to be signed soon between the Albanian  Electroenergy Corporation and the energy company "Preussen  Elektra," an affiliate of a major German concern. The Institute  of Geo-Sciences of Hannover has allocated a fund of DM35 million  for the mine in northern Bulqize, and 85 percent of it has  already been furnished. Of great importance for the development  of this industry in Albania is the German offer represented by  BSE with three partners -- Sachtleben Bergban GmbH, Mannesmann  Anlagenban GmbH, and Metallgesellschaft AG -- which have  requested cooperation with the Albkrom company as a joint  venture, something that will be realized through a tender.  (Tirana ATA in English 0804 GMT 24 Apr 94)    FOREIGN INTEREST IN BEER PRODUCTION: While the Beer Factory  in Tirana has resumed its production after three years of  suspension, some well-known foreign firms have presented their  cooperation projects to the Albanian Ministry of Agriculture and  Food. The foreign firms -- the German "Bramburger," the Italian  "Peroni," and the Greek "Pheninger" -- are the first to have  presented their cooperation projects and studies. Minister of  Agriculture and Food Hasan Halili told ATA that "we have offered  these firms cooperation with beer factories in Tirana, Korce,  and Vlore (the latter is under construction)." Mr. Halili said  that "after examining all the projects, the specialists will  decide on the most profitable offer. (Tirana ATA in English  0806 GMT 24 Apr 94)    FREIGHTER SERVICE: The Tyrsus freighter of the joint company  Duval Line of the Albanian Merchant Fleet and the Italian  company Baund began service recently. The freighter will operate  from Durres to Vasto, a port in the eastern shore of central  Italy, and from Durres to Bari. The freighter is hired and used  by an Albanian crew and has a capacity of 600 passengers, 30  trucks, and 48 cars. The 10 freighters sailing from Durres port  have belonged to foreign firms so far. For the first time, half  of the freighter's income, apart from port taxes and other  services, will go to the Albanian side. This company, in  competition with other freighters, will operate with low  tariffs. (Tirana ATA in English 0814 GMT 25 Apr 94)    PRICE OF STEAM: The price of steam will now be set by the  productive enterprises themselves. Under a government decision,  steam-production enterprises, which are still free of  competition in this field, will not be allowed to abuse their  power to set the steam price. This right will be given to  enterprises with a maximum profit up to 10 percent, fixed by the  electro-energy corporation. Specialists state that the  liberalization of coal and solar energy prices, the increase in  the prices of acid and spare parts, as well as the increase in  workers' salaries influence the increase in steam costs. They  confirm that the previous prices of steam, set in November 1992,  have been at the expense of the Electro-Energy Corporation,  which today is unable to meet the development needs with its own  resources. The price of technological steam is almost the only  price that has not changed since the end of 1992. (Tirana ATA  in English 0817 GMT 25 Apr 94)    ALBCHROME TO BE JOINT VENTURE: The firms "Buero Fuer Social  und Entwicklungsmanagement" from Germany, "Mecolis Corporation,"  a group of Anglo-American firms, "Fucineti" from Italy, and an  Italo- Japanese group are the four firms selected from a tender  that the Albchrome Corporation, the only one in this field in  Albania, will hold soon for the creation of a joint venture.  Authorized sources of this corporation told ATA that, after a  careful selection by Albchrome and its U.S. financial,  technical, and juridical counselors, the tender envisages  re-evaluating the four proposals from the technical, financial,  and juridical angles until the end of April. The negotiating  group and leading board of the Albchrome Corporation will chose  the firm to continue negotiations for the creation of the joint  venture. A draft-agreement for the creation of this joint  enterprise, which is already drafted by the U.S. counselors and  Albchrome specialists, will regulate further negotiations.  Hence, a joint venture is expected to be created for the  extraction and processing of Albanian chrome, which is renowned  in the world market for its quality. (Tirana ATA in English  1001 GMT 25 Apr 94)    FLOUR FACTORY RESUMES PRODUCTION: After a four-year  suspension due to damage, the Flour Factory in Tirana became  active again after one year of reconstruction and reequipment  with modern technology. The factory is fitted with Turkish-made  Orkimsen machinery. Its equipment cost $1.4 million, and the  total value of the factory reconstruction cost 56 million leks,  amounts made available from the Albanian state budget. It is  assumed that the factory will later work in three shifts,  gradually reemploying first 80 and then 120 workers. The  factory accomplishes four processes automatically with a daily  capacity of 150 tonnes of flour, a production three times higher  than before. The high standard production of several kinds of  flour is destined for the Bread and Macaroni Factory, as well as  private bakeries in the capital and its neighborhood. (Tirana  ATA in English 1003 GMT 25 Apr 94)    HEALTH SERVICE FUNDS: Saimir Kadiu, director of the Economic  Department in the Ministry of Health and Environmental  Protection, told ATA that a fund of 4.934 billion leks has been  allocated for the health service in 1994. Kadiu said that this  budget marks a 35 percent increase compared to last year.  Salaries represent 44 percent of this budget, still low if  compared to the salaries of the health workers in the developed  countries, which represent 70 percent of the budget. In this  budget, priority is given to the problem of ensuring medicines,  a fund of 534 million leks, representing 35 percent of the  budget. With the privatization of pharmacies, demands for  medicine were somewhat satisfied, but offers declined because of  the very high prices of medicines in relation to the income of  the population. The Ministry of Health intends to resolve this  social problem, therefore the pharmaceutical network is assumed  to be heterogeneous. A fund of 510 million leks has been  allocated to the Tirana University Hospital Center. About 58  million leks have been put at the disposal of the Maternity Home  of Tirana, 48 million leks to psychiatric hospitals, and 1.3537  billion leks to district hospitals. Another fund of 1.862  billion leks has been allocated for health institutions,  out-patient clinics, dental clinics, health centers, children's  centers in villages, and the hygienic-epidemiologic sector. A  fund of 160 million leks has been allocated to nurseries; a fund  of 300 million leks to investments for the necessary health  equipment and apparatuses. Kadiu states that taking into  account the present needs of the Albanian health service, the  budget is not yet sufficient. (Tirana ATA in English 1204 GMT  25 Apr 94)</p>

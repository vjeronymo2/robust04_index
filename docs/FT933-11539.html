			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / New prototype of the AC Ace A pre-production prototype of the AC Ace, a modern version of the classic sports car of the 1950s and 1960s, went on show yesterday with five original-style but brand-new AC Cobras at Waterhouse Square in the City of London. There is no launch date yet for the Ace, which is made by Weybridge-based AC Cars, the UK's oldest surviving carmaker. The prototype uses a 2.8-litre V6 engine made by Ford, which until last year had a 50.96 per cent stake in AC. The US-based carmaker bought the stake mainly because of AC's production of the Ford-engined Cobra, a big image-builder for Ford which in the 1960s sold the car through its North American dealer network. Ford sold the stake back to Mr Brian Angliss, AC Cars' managing director, who has been seeking a new financial partner to bring the Ace into production.</p>

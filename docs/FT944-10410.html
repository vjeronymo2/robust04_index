			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / Markets Report: Dollar takes fresh heart from US election results The dollar yesterday rallied on the foreign exchanges as traders took heart from the good showing by Republicans in the mid-term congressional elections, writes Philip Gawith. Analysts were split about the implications of the results for the dollar, but the market's initial reaction was to assume that the shift in power towards the Republicans favoured US financial assets and the currency. The dollar finished in London at DM1.53, two pfennigs up from Tuesday's close of DM1.5097. Against the yen it closed at Y97.79 from Y97.005. It ended New York trading at DM1.5275 and Y97.775. Sterling lost 1 1/2 cents against the stronger dollar, closing at Dollars 1.6036 from Dollars 1.6184. It was higher against the D-Mark at DM2.4534 from DM2.4432. Opinions diverged about whether, and why, the election results were important. Some saw them as the catalyst for a big turn in the dollar, predicated on changes to fiscal policy, and a more aggressive Federal Reserve, released from the perceived constraints of a Democratic presidency. Others were more cautious, but said the election was still part of an important conjuncture of events favouring the dollar. Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank in London, said the combination of last week's Fed intervention to support the dollar, the election result, and further monetary tightening made him much more confident about the dollar's prospects. Having been bearish on the dollar for the past year, the Citibank analyst said he had now changed his view: 'The downside for the dollar is likely to be quite limited; I now believe the dollar goes up from here.' Mr MacKinnon added: 'The argument is based on the view that what is crucial for the prospects of the dollar is the relative attractiveness of US financial assets.' He saw this improving, on the basis of the Fed getting 'ahead of the curve' in the battle against inflation, and this attracting financial flows back to the US. Although investor buying would probably only slow the capital outflow from the US, a long term bearish influence on the dollar, Mr MacKinnon said it could rise as far as DM1.67 next year. This would be below the DM1.77 high it touched last February. Not all observers share this optimism. SG Warburg, for example, forecast the dollar at DM1.35-45 at the end of 1995. Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International, was more sceptical about the importance of the elections. He said the result might justify a 'modest rerating' of dollar assets. 'I would be very sceptical, though, about calling this a change in trend in terms of the dollar's performance.' He said the election result had resolved an element of political uncertainty, but this had not been a significant cause of dollar weakness. 'Monetary policy is a 90 per cent explanatory factor,' added Mr Hannah. 'Unless the market feels comfortable about the Fed's policy stance, and the election result does not alter that, then we have not really moved on.' The IBJ analyst said the market price was probably exaggerating the influence of the elections. Yesterday's move was a technical short squeeze, rather than a shift in trend. The latter would require aggressive Fed action  -two 50 basis-point increases in US rates before the end of the year - and an indication that earlier tightenings were slowing the economy, thus curbing inflationary pressures. The French franc fell to FFr3.438/DM, from FFr3.436, its lowest level since December last year, with the early stages of next year's presidential campaign beginning to weigh on the currency. Mr Chis Turner, currency analyst at BZW in London, said: 'It is difficult to see the franc appreciating ahead of the election, even if the dollar stages a strong recovery.' The catalyst for recent weakness was the entry into the campaign of Mr Jacques Chirac. He unnerved markets by saying French participation in European monetary union should be put to a referendum. The Bank of England provided UK money markets with Pounds 1.015bn of late assistance, and Pounds 143m at established rates, after forecasting a Pounds 1.3bn daily shortage. Three-month LIBOR was at 6 1/8 per cent. Firmer gilt prices helped short sterling futures, with the December contract closing at 93.60 from 93.55.</p>

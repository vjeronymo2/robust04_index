			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, May 30, RIA--The Duma faction of the  Agrarian Party of Russia considers as "political indecency" the  far from proper word used by former Russian Secretary of State  Gennadiy Burbulis in the Sunday Itogi television programme to  describe the way the new Constitution of Russia was adopted.    This is said in a statement issued by the faction. The  faction believes that Burbulis insulted millions of people who  on December 12 voted for the new fundamental law.    "The Agrarian Party was firmly against the adopted version  of  the Constitution. Mr Burbulis must have forgotten the vigour  and persistence with which the presidential team, in which Mr  Burbulis had no last role to play, was pushing through its draft  of the fundamental law," said the statement.    The document also mentions "Mr Burbulis's sinister role in  the history of Russia of the recent period".</p>

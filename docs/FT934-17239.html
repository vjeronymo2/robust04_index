			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / Government Bonds: Treasuries ease across range after economic data US TREASURY prices eased across the maturity range yesterday, sending long yields back above 6 per cent, following an upbeat Chicago purchasing managers' report. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  11/32 at 103 1/8 , yielding 6.018 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was down  1/32 at 100, to yield 3.859 per cent. After a slow opening, prices eased across the board when the Chicago purchasing managers' index, a reliable indicator for the national index which is released today, showed a sharp increase for September. Traders were unsettled by a big jump in the employment index. The data, combined with the earlier report of an 11,000 decline in weekly jobless claims, depressed bond market sentiment and pushed the 30-year yield above 6 per cent again. The day's other economic figures - a 1.3 per cent increase in August personal income and a 0.3 per cent increase in August personal spending, and a 3.1 per cent decline in August new home sales - were broadly in line with expectations and had little impact upon prices. THE sell-off in US Treasuries, and the latest developments in Russia, hit Europe's bond markets in late trading. German government bonds fell about  1/4 point towards the close, led by a sell-off in the futures pits. Bunds have risen in recent days on supportive inflation numbers, and on signs that Germany's industrial employers will take a tough stance in the coming wage round. 'After making some hefty profits, people decided to take some profits,' said a Frankfurt trader. The 6 per cent yield on the 10-year benchmark is also proving a hurdle few traders were willing to tackle. 'There was no real news to help us through that level,' said the trader. The 6 1/2 per cent bonds of 2003 yielded 6.10 per cent in late trade, up from 6.06 per cent earlier in the day. Traders reported little retail selling though, and bunds are expected to remain range-bound in the next few days. FRENCH government bonds eased in line with Germany on late profit-taking in largely futures-driven trading. As expected, the central bank left its 6.75 per cent intervention rate unchanged at its latest repo operation and traders say bonds are likely to remain range-bound until the next repo allocation Monday. GILT futures ended fractionally lower after retracing earlier gains, while cash market prices were mixed. Dealers said the market lacked any real direction in the wake of Wednesday's auction. Prices firmed in the morning on the back of rumours of a large switch from US Treasuries into gilts after the auction, but the market ran out of steam in the afternoon. The long gilt future on Liffe ended at 113 1/8 , down 3/32 from Wednesday's close. THE ITALIAN bond market stood out against the rest of Europe, with the December BTP future hitting another historic high at 116.20. While most of the gains were eroded towards the close, the market is expected to continue its recent strong performance. 'Italy still looks good - it's hard to be pessimistic about it,' said Mr Kit Juckes, European economist with SG Warburg. 'Italy is not a high-inflation country any more, and this will allow the authorities to cut rates further,' he said. Mr Juckes especially favours selling Belgian bonds against Italian bonds while Belgium remains dogged by its fiscal and structural problems. Belgian bonds weakened despite the central bank's 0.10-point cut in its central and end-of-day rates. The 10-year yield spread over Germany ended at 133 basis points, against 130 on Wednesday.</p>

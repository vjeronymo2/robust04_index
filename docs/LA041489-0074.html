			<p><P> April 14, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Actress Audrey Hepburn joined U.N. officials in Khartoum to see a Nile River  barge depart for famine-threatened southern Sudan with 100 tons of food and  medicine -- the first of more than 100,000 tons the United Nations hopes to  ship to the war-torn region by month's end. The barge is expected to join  several other river craft in Kosti, about 175 miles to the south, before  continuing to the besieged garrison city of Malakal. Hepburn, a good-will  ambassador for the U.N. Children's Fund, next plans to visit Nairobi to observe  efforts to move food northward into Sudan from Kenya and Uganda.  </P></p>

			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Stock index futures fell steeply, leading the cash market lower for most of the day with premiums to cash equities narrowing at times to little more than two points, writes Jeffrey Brown. Turnover was heavy with volume at the official 4.10pm close running to 15,099 contracts, against 14,599 on Friday. Unlike the cash market, futures traders had an active day. The FT-SE December contract closed 49 points lower at 2,993. This was at least above the day's low of 2,987 which was touched in the final hour of trading. At the close the premium to the cash market was 9.5 points with the fair value premium extending to around 16 points. Selling pressure was mostly heavy throughout the session, forcing the December contract down to a level at times close to parity with the cash market. Traders said a number of hard-nosed bear runs had been made with the locals  -independent traders - leading the charge. Institutional business remained non-existent. Traded option turnover also bounded ahead, rising from 22,036 lots on Friday to 35,586 lots. FT-SE and Euro FT-SE volume accounted for 22,822 lots. Scottish Power was the most actively traded individual stock option at 1,356 lots, with HSBC also active.</p>

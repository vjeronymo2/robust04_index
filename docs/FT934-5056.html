			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: PSBR in 1994-95 forecast to shrink back to Pounds 37.9bn - Government receipts set to rise by 10 per cent / North Sea revenues expected to top Pounds 2bn as production picks up This section brings together the detailed forecasts of revenue, spending, borrowing and debt for 1993-94 and 1994-95. The presentation of the public sector accounts now reflects the chancellor's commitment to draw a clear distinction between current and capital transactions. The outturn for the public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) in 1992-93 was Pounds 36.7bn, Pounds 1bn more than estimated in the March budget. The latest forecast for 1993-94 is a PSBR of Pounds 49.8bn, equivalent to 7 per cent of GDP. This forecast is only marginally changed from the March budget, although there have been offsetting changes to some components. Taking into account the new public expenditure plans and the tax changes announced in this budget, the PSBR in 1994-95 is forecast to come down to Pounds 37.9bn, or 5 per cent of GDP, the first year-on-year reduction since 1988-89. Receipts in 1994-95 are expected to rise faster than money GDP, reflecting both economic recovery and the tax increases announced in the March and November budgets. And tight control of public expenditure is expected to bring general government expenditure (GGE) growth below that of GDP, despite a further sharp rise in debt interest payments. The public sector financial deficit (PSFD) is forecast at 8 per cent of GDP in 1993-94, falling to 6 per cent of GDP in 1994-95. The gap between the PSBR and the PSFD - around  3/4 per cent of GDP in 1993-94 - represents various financial transactions, notably privatisation proceeds. The difference between the public sector's financial deficit and its current deficit is net capital expenditure (net of depreciation), less capital transfers. The current deficit is expected to stand at 6 1/2 per cent of GDP in 1993-94, falling to 4 1/2 per cent of GDP in 1994-95. The forecast reduction in the PSFD in 1994-95 is primarily due to a lower current deficit. The general government financial deficit (GGFD) is expected to be a little higher than the PSFD in 1993-94 at 8 3/4 per cent of GDP, reflecting the small financial surplus projected for the public corporations sector. It is forecast to fall to 6 1/4 per cent of GDP in 1994-95. Public sector debt: The stock of net public sector debt at end-March 1993 was Pounds 201.5bn, 32 3/4 per cent of GDP. The latest forecast of the PSBR for 1993-94 implies a rise to 38 1/2 per cent at end-March 1994, marginally lower than projected in March, mainly because of a higher forecast level of GDP. A further rise is in prospect to 41 3/4 per cent at end-March 1995. General government gross debt is projected to rise from 41 per cent of GDP at end-March 1993 to 49 per cent at end-March 1995. The 1992-93 outturn: The PSBR in 1992-93 was around Pounds 1bn higher than forecast in the March budget. This was more than explained by lower receipts. The 1993-94 forecast: The latest forecast of the 1993-94 PSBR is marginally lower than the March budget. Expenditure is now forecast at around Pounds 1bn lower than in March; there is a slightly smaller downward revision to the forecast of receipts. Although GDP growth is now expected to be a little higher than forecast in March, revenues from most taxes have been running at or below expectations. VAT receipts in particular have been weaker than expected. General government receipts are now expected to rise by 3 per cent in 1993-94. This is below the forecast growth in money GDP (5 1/2 per cent), but compares with a rise in receipts of only  1/2 per cent recorded in 1992-93. Within this total: the forecast of Inland Revenue receipts is more or less unchanged from the March budget forecast; income tax receipts are expected to be up on 1992-93, as are receipts of petroleum revenue tax and stamp duties. But this is partly offset by lower corporation tax; the rise in Customs and Excise receipts in 1993-94 is weaker than in the March Budget forecast. This is explained by a substantially lower forecast of VAT receipts, in line with the outturn observed so far this year; social security receipts are much as expected in March. But the forecast of interest and dividend receipts is higher, reflecting the buoyant outturn to date. General government receipts are forecast to rise by 10 per cent in 1994-95, significantly more than money GDP growth (6 1/2 per cent). Tax increases are an important factor. The measures announced in the March budget but not due to be implemented until 1994-95 will increase taxes by around Pounds 3.75bn (mostly from income tax, social security contributions and VAT) as compared with indexed 1993-94 levels. The November budget measures will increase taxes in 1994-95 by a further Pounds 1.75bn. Even without these measures, the projected increase in general government receipts in 1994-95 would still be around 7 1/2 per cent, which is higher than money GDP growth. Within this forecast total for 1994-95: Inland Revenue receipts are forecast to increase by 14 per cent from their 1993-94 level. Around a quarter of this is due to higher corporation tax, reflecting a cyclical recovery. Most of the rest of the increase is due to income tax, where receipts are boosted by the two sets of budget measures; Customs and Excise receipts are forecast to rise by 11 per cent, of which about half reflects the tax measures in the March and November budgets. Without the two sets of budget measures, receipts would grow slightly faster than consumer spending; social security receipts are forecast to rise by 10 per cent, of which around a third reflects the net impact of the two sets of budget changes. North Sea revenues: North Sea revenues in 1993-94, at under Pounds 1.5bn, are expected to be little higher than last year's outturn and Pounds 750m lower than forecast in the March budget. Petroleum revenue tax (PRT) receipts are expected to be marginally lower than forecast reflecting the lower oil price. But corporation tax receipts are now expected to be more than Pounds 500m lower, because of higher repayments of tax (caused by lower settlements for old years) and lower liabilities in 1992. North Sea revenues are expected to rise to over Pounds 2bn in 1994-95, as oil and gas production picks up, and following the reforms to PRT in the March budget. This would still represent less than  1/2 per cent of GDP, as compared with a peak of 3 3/4 per cent of GDP in the mid-1980s. Taxes as a share of GDP: The ratio of tax and social security revenues to GDP has fallen quite sharply since the onset of recession, from 37 per cent in 1990-91 to 34 3/4 per cent in 1992-93. A further reduction to 34 per cent is expected for 1993-94. Although output has been growing since mid-1992, the cycle in tax revenues tends to lag behind that in economic activity. Certain taxes - for example mainstream corporation tax and income tax on self-employment income - are collected a year or so in arrears, and these taxes are among those which show the greatest variability over the cycle. With economic recovery continuing through 1993 and 1994, and the tax measures announced in the March and November budgets taking effect, the tax to GDP ratio should rise sharply in 1994-95. The forecast is for an increase of nearly 1 1/2 percentage points in 1994-95. Expenditure: General government expenditure (GGE) in 1993-94 is now put at around Pounds 1bn below the March budget forecast. The control total is expected to turn out between Pounds 250m and Pounds 500m below the public spending plans. The main explanation of lower GGE outside of the control total is lower cyclical social security spending which mainly reflects a lower outturn for unemployment than assumed in the March Budget forecast. For 1994-95, new control total spending is to be held to a cash rise of 2 3/4 per cent, which represents a fall of 1 1/4 per cent in real terms. And although expenditure outside the control total is expected to rise somewhat faster, the forecast growth in GGE excluding privatisation proceeds - 4 per cent in cash terms, or zero in real terms - is much lower than for 1993-94. Much of the growth in spending outside the control total is expected to come from debt interest payments, reflecting the rising level of public sector debt. Central government debt interest is expected to rise by 11 per cent in 1993-94, and by 16 per cent in 1994-95. General government debt interest payments (which also includes local authorities' interest payments on borrowing from the market) are now rising as a per cent of GDP following a period of six years when the ratio was falling. The forecast assumes privatisation proceeds of Pounds 5bn in 1994-95, a similar level to the expected outturn for 1993-94. Public sector capital expenditure, net of depreciation, is expected to total around Pounds 14bn in 1993-94, an increase of Pounds 750m on 1992-93. There will be a reduction in 1994-95 from the high real level of spending maintained during the recession. However, this will be offset to some extent by the impact of the private finance initiative, which will lead to additional investment financed by the private sector in areas previously regarded as public sector.</p>

While more companies are hiring foreigners to satisfy their  needs for special expertise or to make use of their differing  cultural backgrounds, the trend also shows that "Japan's labor  market has become attractive (to foreigners)," the ministry's  Immigration Bureau said.    A total of 9,445 foreigners received residence status as  "technical" or "cultural" experts in international business in  1992.    More than 80 percent of the 7,336 foreigners who could be  contacted for statistical purposes were in their 20s or 30s, and  nearly 70 percent were men. By country, 2,750 came from the  United States, followed by 1,157 from China and 757 from Britain.    A majority of the foreigners were working as language  teachers at various kinds of schools. Computer-related jobs,  commerce and trade were other areas in which many foreigners  were working.</p>

			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Arts: Background for Evelyn Glennie - Weekend concerts in London The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra provided the backing for virtuoso percussionist Evelyn Glennie at the Royal Festival Hall on Sunday night, as part of a programme conducted by Paul Daniel and also including Stravinsky's Petrushka and Britten's Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra. This last was played with crisp decisiveness: I had not heard it in years, and was thrilled to bits by the utter simplicity and mastery of Britten's musico-pedagogical scheme. The section in which the percussion are displayed  -each instrument, down to gong, block and whip, instantly and subtly characterised - had more to say musically as well as pedagogically than the whole of the percussion concerto by the 60-year old Dane, Per Norgard, which followed. For a Change is a work in four movements - the inner pair much briefer than the outer - developed in 1983 from a solo percussion piece, I Ching, which Norgard composed the previous year. The movements have I Ching-like titles referring to states of being, such as 'The Gentle, The Penetrating' for the third movement, in which the soloist concentrates on the kalimba (ie sansa or mbira), an African metal-bar glockenspiel-ish instrument, played with the thumbs; or 'Thunder Repeated: The Image of Shock', which speaks for itself. Quite a variety of percussion was used, though more pitchless than pitched. Glennie in stockinged feet slid from one to another of four performance stations at the front of the platform, sometimes engaging in dialogue with members of the orchestra - exquisitely so when kalimba-ing with the two flutes - but alarmingly often breaking into long cadenzas and going bananas on the tom-toms. The orchestral parts had a disappointing tendency to turn into vamping after just a few bars of strict notation; and the work's problem, in a nutshell, was that it was too much percussion and not nearly enough concerto.</p>

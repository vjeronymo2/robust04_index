			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Banking on a little luck: The outlook for a Pounds 3.1bn merger A century ago, the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank had a secret weapon: 'joss', the pidgin English word for the protection of the local gods, the good luck they bring. 'Truly joss take care this bank,' said a Shanghai businessman; and one of its legendary early managers was known as 'Lucky' Jackson. In announcing yesterday's Pounds 3.1bn bid for the UK's Midland Bank, its boldest gamble yet, the Hongkong Bank has taken great care to minimise the need for luck. It is making an all-paper offer, rather than the part-cash bid that Midland's management asked for. It has pitched its offer at the cautious end of the range. It has gone to great lengths to square as many of the regulatory authorities as possible. Yet joss will still play a central role in determining the takeover's fate. Luck will be needed, first of all, in steering the bid to completion. Stockbrokers' analysts were hoping for a higher price than the 378p a share at which the bid values Midland. Shareholders were saying yesterday that they had expected at least 400p, and that the bid would have to be raised. Whether that is a realistic assessment depends on decisions at Lloyds Bank, the most successful big UK bank of the past decade, which had made an informal takeover approach to Midland before Hongkong Bank stepped in. 'Our view of a bid from another clearer,' said Mr Brian Pearse, Midland's chief executive, yesterday, 'was that it was extremely unlikely that it would have received the approval of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.' Even if it had, he said, the complementary factors were few, apart from the possible cost savings from big redundancies. A combined Lloyds/Midland 'would have had even more of an emphasis on the UK' than at present. Lloyds clearly has no fears of a UK concentration: it has based its recent success on making money close to home. It is now mulling over what to do next. There are no other likely bidders, so if luck favours the Hongkong team and Lloyds stays out of the bidding, the offer will be considered on its merits. Midland's shareholders, who received only 4.53p per share in dividends last year, will get 13.57p in dividends from their new shares in HSBC Holdings, the Hongkong Bank's new London-based parent company, and another 11p interest on the loan stock which makes up part of the offer. Investors will have to balance that short-term gain against the possibility of a sharp rise in post-tax earnings from an independent Midland Bank once the recession ends. One big shareholder, the Kuwait Investment Office, has been trying to sell most of its 10 per cent holding of Midland shares, from the moment the terms were announced  - an indication that it preferred cash today to the Hongkong offer or to the possibility of a higher price from Lloyds. If fortune favours its bid, the Hongkong Bank will still have to tackle the task of running the merged operation. London will be the headquarters of the holding company and the base for the senior executives who hold the main functional responsibilities. Mr William Purves, HSBC's chairman and chief executive, says that, in due course, 'there will be a group chairman and a group chief executive, both with an overview of Hongkong Bank and Midland. Both will be executives, with the chairman doing a lot of the representational work, but the buck will stop with the chief executive, who will reside in London.' The group's individual banks  - in Hong Kong, the Midland in the UK, Marine Midland in the US  - will retain their identities. But they will focus more on retail business, leaving treasury management and technology to the centre. It is not clear how much influence the individual banks will have in relationships with the group's 300 largest corporate customers. A central team, described in the offer document as 'an enhanced International Corporate Accounts capability', will keep a close eye on big customers. Midland's big-time corporate bankers may find themselves reined-in. The Hongkong team is confident it can run the merged group. 'We've been in international banking for 130 years,' says Mr John Gray, deputy chairman of HSBC Holdings. But he goes on: 'I would like to think we've learned our lessons' from previous overseas problems in the US and in Australia. Mr Purves, who will move to London to chair the combined group, makes a similar point: 'I think I can be criticised for not making management changes in Australia, UK and the US soon enough,' he said recently. The new group management clearly intends to keep a close hold on its subsidiaries  - but with important businesses on three continents, its inbred management culture will be stretched to the limit. If the Hongkong bid succeeds, and the management challenge is successfully met, there is still a third need for luck. The merged bank will be very big, and very strongly capitalised. It will rank, say the Hongkong people, in the world's top 10 by size, and will be the second biggest outside Japan. More importantly, perhaps, now that HSBC has revealed its Pounds 1bn of hidden reserves, the merged bank will handsomely meet the Basle ratios for capital adequacy, due to take effect at the end of this year. It will have 'tier 1' capital (shareholders' funds) of 5.9 per cent of assets, nearly half as high again as the Basle minimum of 4 per cent; and it will have total capital equal to 10.9 per cent of assets, compared with Basle's 8 per cent minimum. The takeover itself will cost money: HSBC will be making a provision of Pounds 190m for the takeover and Pounds 200m to take account of the change in HSBC's tax status in the UK. Mr Purves promised yesterday that the synergies from the deal would outweigh these one-off costs. Potential areas for synergy include trade finance, where Hongkong Bank believes it has much to teach Midland; technology, where Mr Purves believes Hongkong Bank is a world leader; treasury, where there are potential savings from merging the two banks' operations; and investment banking, to be run as a global business with shared back offices behind the separate identities of Samuel Montagu, James Capel, Trinkaus &amp; Burkhardt, Euromobiliare and Wardley. So far, so good. But another way of looking at the combined bank is to assess the quality of its core businesses. On that basis, fortune is badly needed. There is one enormously strong business, and a clutch of weaker ones. The strong business is banking in Hong Kong, which generated pre-tax profits for HSBC of Pounds 761m last year, 86 per cent of the total. Yet uncertainties will hang over the Hong Kong business until the colony has survived its transition to Chinese rule. By comparison with Hong Kong, the other businesses are much less impressive  - even the Pounds 117m earned in the rest of the Asia-Pacific region, or the Pounds 73m in the Middle East and India. There were losses in the Americas and in continental Europe. Midland Bank made only a Pounds 36m profit before tax. In the US, Marine Midland was back in profit in the first quarter and, in the UK, Mr Pearse is optimistic about Midland's underlying trading. These remain, however, weak banks in fiercely competitive markets. In time, with hard work and careful decision-making, they can probably be rebuilt. But a little joss would help.</p>

			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Letter: The CAB and employees' rights Sir, I am writing to correct an inaccuracy in your report, 'Union restrictions extended by new law' (June 18), which seriously misrepresents the position of the Citizens Advice Bureaux Service. The CAB service, while recommending that individual employment rights should be strengthened, has never argued that this should supersede collective bargaining. The service sees no contradiction between the role of collective bargaining and strengthening individual employment rights. When clients come to a CAB with an employment problem, they will be advised to consult their trade union or staff association if they are members. This is because the union or staff association will have detailed knowledge of the employer's practices and will be able to represent the client most effectively. Involvement of a trade union will almost always strengthen the client's position. If the client is not in a trade union, or does not wish to consult one, the CAB will always offer advice and representation as appropriate. Employment is now the third highest subject of inquiries to Citizens Advice Bureaux. While some elements of the new legislation will undoubtedly be beneficial to CAB clients, the service remains extremely concerned about a number of provisions in the Trade Union Reform and Employment Rights Bill, in particular the abolition of wages councils. In the absence of collective bargaining in the sectors covered by wages councils, their abolition is likely to result in a decrease in wages and increased dependence on social security benefits, as was pointed out by your editorial 'Waging war' (November 6 1992). Ann Abraham, chief executive, Citizens Advice Bureau, Myddelton House, 115-123 Pentonville Road, London N1 9LZ</p>

			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / Tories remove Smith references from manifesto Conservative party officials announced yesterday that references to John Smith in the party's European election manifesto were being deleted before its delayed launch next week. That followed Friday's postponement by the government of the white paper on competitiveness, a gesture intended to underpin the new, less confrontational mood of British politics ushered in by Mr Smith's death. But a row over campaign literature prepared by the Tories before Mr Smith's death last week underlined the fragility of the present suspension of hostilities between the main parties. Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader and a long-time campaigner against personal mudslinging at Westminster, said he was worried that the new mood would not last. Close colleagues of Mr Major, who like Mr Smith has a reputation for integrity, said the prime minister saw a genuine opportunity for politicians on all sides to raise the level of political debate. In the process they could seek to rebuild their battered reputations with voters. But the dispute over the alleged 'smears' in the latest edition of the Conservatives' campaign guide was seen by many at Westminster as a more reliable pointer to the future. The guide included many familiar attacks on Mr Smith's leadership, describing him as 'ineffectual' and 'visionless'. Its tone contrasted sharply with the fulsome tribute to the former Labour leader by Mr Major in the Commons on Thursday. Ministers insisted the criticisms were simply part of the normal 'rough-and-tumble' of politics during elections campaigns and pointed to similar personal attacks by Labour figures on Mr Major's leadership. But Mr David Blunkett, the Labour party chairman, said the guide advised Tory candidates in the forthcoming European elections to say 'very personal and unpleasant things which had little to do with the policy differences we have in Europe'. He added: 'This personal abuse contrasts with what has happened over the last three days.' Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, had planned to launch the white paper on British competitiveness alongside Mr Major and several other cabinet ministers later today. However officials said it would be delayed at least until next week. Bookmakers William Hill made Mr Tony Blair the favourite for the Labour leadership. He was originally quoted at 2-5 and is now 1-5, with others as follows: Gordon Brown 4-1, Robin Cook 8-1, John Prescott 12-1, Margaret Beckett 20-1, Jack Cunningham 33-1. Labour are 8-11 favourites to win the next general election, with the Conservatives at even money.</p>

			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / The Japanese Election: End of an era as the heavyweights clash - A confused electorate finds sumo wrestling more clear-cut than politics GATHERED around an oversized video screen in the Ginza shopping district, several hundred people watched and gasped yesterday as the spectacle of battle unfolded before them, certain that, whatever the outcome, Japan had entered a new era. Instead of the white gloves of campaigning politicians, the combatants on the screen wore the scant mawashi of the sumo wrestler, as the finale of a national tournament was played out by three contestants, one of them American, who are symbols of the passing of the old order in Japan. At least the outcome of the sumo tournament was clear: the American, Akebono, won. When Japanese went to bed last night, they knew the Liberal Democratic party had lost its majority and the largest opposition party, the Social Democratic party, had been humbled, but they didn't know who was running the country. 'I don't care who is the leader, as long as the LDP is punished,' a young man watching the sumo explained. But a nearby young woman said all she wanted was the replacement of Mr Kiichi Miyazawa as prime minister: 'That's the most important thing.' The confusion and the conflicting opinions have been stirred by the rise of two parties, the Japan New party and the Japan Renewal party, a former faction of the LDP, which has a large share of the balance of power. Mr Tsutomu Hata, the JRP leader, shared an ailment with the leaders of the parties with which he may form a coalition government. They had cracked, hoarse voices after two weeks of the constant speechmaking and loud hailer-shouting that is campaigning in Japan. 'I'm very happy that the people have given us such support,' rasped Mr Hata. But the JRP leader, who prides himself on his straight talking, was as vague as other party leaders when it came to describing the likely form of the new government: 'There will need to be a lot of discussion.' Before the discussion started, the rumours circulated. An opposition party leader who had promised to form a coalition with the JRP was talking openly of joining an LDP-led coalition government. The JNP was said to be swinging both ways, towards a partnership with the JRP and with the LDP. With the politicians being politicians, the sumo wrestlers had a drawing power of their own yesterday. A record low voting turnout, estimated provisionally at 67 per cent, was partly blamed on apathy, partly on the miserable weather, and partly on the attraction of the sumo.</p>

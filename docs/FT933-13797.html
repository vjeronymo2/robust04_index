			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Portuguese condemn Renault plan PORTUGAL'S trade minister, Mr Fernando Faria de Oliveira, has written a harsh letter to his French counterpart, Mr Gerard Longuet, over Renault's plan to dismiss more than 300 workers from the French car-manufacturing plant at Setubal, south of Lisbon, writes Peter Wise in Lisbon. 'Foreign investment has always been welcomed in Portugal,' the letter says. 'But we don't want projects that set up here like Bedouins, that are nomad by nature.' Portugal contests Renault's economic argument for the dismissals, which will reduce production at Setubal from 80,000 to 43,000 cars a year. Portugal says this is disproportionate to Renault's 13.8 per cent drop in production worldwide. But Renault says half the production in Setubal is for export to Spain, where sales have fallen 30 per cent.</p>

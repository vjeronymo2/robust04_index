			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Arts: Anne-Sophie Mutter - Concert The opening - a distant voice gradually making contact, as though from places far removed or a time long past - intimated from the outset that this would not be an ordinary performance of Sibelius's Violin Concerto. The mood and the delicacy are written into the score, but that does not mean they often come across so palpably. The Sibelius concerto was not among the selection that Anne-Sophie Mutter chose to play in the series of concerts devoted to her at the Barbican a couple of years ago. Nor has she yet recorded it; perhaps it is not one of those to which she feels closest. But it would have been difficult to come to that conclusion from the performance she gave of it at the Royal Festival Hall on Tuesday with The London Philharmonic. The last time that I heard this concerto, the soloist was the very young Midori - petite in tone, precise, perfectionist. There was little variety in the colour of the playing and within the first couple of pages Mutter had already traversed more ground in that respect than Midori did in the whole concerto, pleasing though she was for other reasons. With Mutter colour is expression; it speaks, it makes music. On this occasion there was a lot of the full-blown romantic, dark, deep playing on the G string that she favours for Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto (the Sibelius is its Northern younger relation) and the warmth of The London Philharmonic's sound goes well with that. The closing pages of the slow movement seemed to me particularly evocative, wonderfully measured, thoughtful playing. The finale was exciting - and never a sign of strain. With a captive audience come to see the evening's soloist, Franz Welser-Most and the orchestra were able to offer an unusual first half. Schubert is being featured as a running theme for a month or two and the concerto was preceded by Joachim's orchestration of the composer's Grand Duo for piano duet, a sort of overgrown divertimento, which could not stand as the main item of a concert itself. To start, they gave what sounded a sharp and well-rehearsed performance of Nicholas Maw's Spring Music. With its rich textures bubbling with activity, not unlike Janacek thrilling at nature's evergreen renewal, the piece seeks to put into music 'the energy and beauty of spring'. It is an approachable example of the music of the 1980s, deserving of a re-hearing. Are we perhaps also seeing the green shoots of more adventurous programme-planning on the South Bank?</p>

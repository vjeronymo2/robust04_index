			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / Karadzic threatens all-out war if Nato attacks Serbs BOSNIAN SERB leader Mr Radovan Karadzic warned yesterday that Nato air strikes against Serb targets could unleash an all-out war which would leave his Moslem rivals with no territory. 'If a single bomb strikes a Serbian position, there would be no more talks. We would have an all-out war and catastrophe,' he said. 'The attack would trigger a huge battle and chaos. There would be tremendous suffering on all three sides.' Mr Karadzic added that he would probably lose control of Bosnian Serb militiamen, apparently playing on the fears of Britain, France and Canada, whose United Nations troops on the ground could face retaliation by Serb forces. His comments came in an interview after the international mediators, Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, postponed talks because Serb forces had not withdrawn from strategic Mount Igman, west of Sarajevo. French UN troops later said Bosnian Serb militiamen had retaken positions they had vacated the previous day on mounts Igman and Bjelasnica - a move that deepened international frustration about Serb manoeuvring. But as Nato finalised its military preparations for possible strikes, after its meeting on Monday which approved the logistics for strikes, officials admitted that action was unlikely in the next couple of days. Before any strikes can start, the UN, Nato or a member of the alliance must make a specific appeal for action, which must then receive final authorisation from Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general. US officials yesterday said they would be pushing for Mr Boutros Ghali to approve action quickly, amid suspicions that the European allies still lacked political will to press on with the strikes. But speaking at his lakeside hotel in Geneva, Mr Karadzic denounced as 'absolutely irresponsible' western threats to launch air strikes. He said it encouraged Bosnia's President Alija Izetbegovic to hold out for military intervention and derail talks on the republic's ethnic partition. Mr Izetbegovic has refused to return to the negotiating table with Serb and Croat adversaries until Serb forces withdraw from the strategic heights above Sarajevo. He appears to be waiting to see whether Nato will push ahead with the air strikes. He yesterday criticised Lord Owen for his cautious response to Nato's threat. 'I am not satisfied with Owen's statement on air strikes. In this way they (the mediators) are supporting the other side. This is counter productive,' he said. An angry Mr Karadzic warned: 'If Izetbegovic continues to sabotage the talks, he will lose everything.' Russia announced yesterday it was contacting the US and leaders in former Yugoslavia to try to avert the use of outside force. Russia has traditionally sympathised with the Serbs, although moderate politicians around President Boris Yeltsin have been anxious not to let this undermine improved relations with the west. As a permanent member of the Security Council, Russia would have crucial influence over whether air strikes should be authorised in Bosnia. Letter, Page 12</p>

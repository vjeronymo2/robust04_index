			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> WEEK IN REVIEW;  </P> <P> SIMI VALLEY;  </P> <P> BRALY DENIES URGING POT DECRIMINALIZATION  </P> <P> With a mini-blizzard of news releases, a conservative Republican activist last  week injected the politically pungent issue of decriminalizing marijuana into  the race between Assemblywoman Cathie Wright of Simi Valley and Hunt Braly, her  GOP challenger.  </P> <P> Braly, who has accused fellow Republican Wright of ethics violations, suddenly  found himself denying charges that, as head of a Republican college group in  1980, he advocated the legalization of marijuana.  </P> <P> The charges were leveled by conservative GOP activist Steve Frank, a Simi  Valley public affairs consultant and admitted Wright supporter.  </P> <P> During an endorsement meeting of a local chapter of the conservative California  Republican Assembly, Frank produced a flyer he maintained was printed by the  college group headed by Braly, a one-time USC student. The flyer, in part,  urged decriminalizing marijuana for personal use, saying it was "ludicrous" to  put small-time pot users in jail with "rapists and murderers."  </P> <P> The flyer carried a phone number that matched what appeared to be Braly's  former home number on another document produced by Frank. But Braly, an aide to  state Sen. Ed Davis (R-Santa Clarita), a former Los Angeles police chief,  denied that he ever advocated legalizing drugs -- or smoked marijuana himself.  </P> <P> Braly said he "didn't recall" the flyer or whether his college group ever  formally advocated pot decriminalization. He also said local chapters of the  organization, California College Republicans, often printed their own  handbills, attaching his phone number because his apartment served as  headquarters for the cash-starved group.  </P> <P> But the manner in which the pot charge surfaced was almost as interesting as  the charge itself. Frank, an ex-CRA president who noted that he is no friend of  the "liberal" Braly, said he received the pro-pot flyer in the mail but had no  idea who the sender was. Asked if Wright's campaign had anything to do with  slipping Frank the material, Wright campaign manager Mark Thomas said, "I don't  have any knowledge of that."  </P> <P> Whoever sent it, the material had the desired effect. Frank dispatched news  releases about the flyer to no fewer than 47 newspapers and radio and  television stations. And after he presented it to his CRA chapter, the group  unanimously voted to endorse the conservative Wright over Braly in their June 5  face-off for the GOP nomination in the 37th Assembly District.  </P> <P> Despite his denials, the resulting publicity put Braly on the defensive, at  least momentarily, in his effort to spear Wright with the ethics issue. On the  stump, Braly has repeatedly called attention to Wright's well-publicized  attempts to intervene with police and judges on behalf of her daughter,  Victoria, who faced jail or losing her license after receiving 28 traffic  tickets over several years.  </P></p>

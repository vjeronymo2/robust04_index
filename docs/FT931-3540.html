			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Charities targeted by unions' bank UNITY Trust Bank, the small bank set up by the unions and the Co-operative Wholesale Society, is to step up its competition with the high-street banks by extending its services to charities and and voluntary organisations, Mr Gordon Beesley, the bank's managing director, said yesterday. The bank will offer small charities with a turnover of less than Pounds 5m a year free banking, while larger charities will be offered no-interest, no-commission services. The bank believes charities are suffering as a result of increased bank charges. It also plans to launch a campaign to encourage employers to provide occupational pension schemes for low-paid workers in conjunction with other employers and the bank. It estimates that between 7m and 9m workers have no provision beyond the state pension. Sir Dennis Landau, the bank's new chairman, announced the broad outline of its plans at the same time as its annual results for 1992. Those showed that the bank made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 368,000 after a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.7m the previous year. The bank's risk-asset ratio - the standard for assessing balance-sheet strength - rose from 18.5 per cent to 22.7 per cent last year while the number of its accounts rose 11 per cent to more than 15,000 with just over a quarter from outside the union movement.</p>

The sources base this conclusion on information which said  that the killers of the late Na'ib al-Ma'ayitah belong to  Fatah-the Revolutionary Council organization, led by Abu-Nidal  [Sabri al-Banna]. Abu-Nidal left Libya after the Gulf War and  decided to settle in Kuwait after he established new links with  the Gulf states. [passage omitted]</p>

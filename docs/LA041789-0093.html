			<p><P> April 17, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALAMO AGREES TO CHANGE CAR RENTAL REFILL FEES  </P> <P> Alamo Rent A Car will change the way it charges for refilling the gas tanks of  its rental cars in an effort to meet standards proposed by the National Assn.  of Attorneys General, a company spokeswoman says.  </P> <P> The move by Alamo, which is based in Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., comes amid a series  of lawsuits against rental car companies alleging that fuel charges are  inaccurately calculated and inadequately disclosed. The new rental car industry  guidelines from NAAG, an organization that has no law enforcement powers, were  issued April 1 and called for prominent disclosure in advertisements of all  mandatory gasoline fees.  </P> <P> Renters always have the option of filling the gas tank themselves before they  return the car. With vehicles rented from the Big Four rental firms -- Hertz,  Avis, National and Budget -- the renter thus can avoid the companies' refueling  charges. However, at Alamo and some smaller rental agencies a mandatory fuel  charge has been levied regardless.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Asked to Choose  </P> <P> As of May 1, Alamo's mandatory $11.95 charge for half a tank of gasoline will  no longer be required at any of its 82 U.S. offices, spokeswoman Liz Clark  said. Instead, customers will be asked to choose between paying the flat fee or  agreeing to return the car with as much gas as it had when it was rented. If  the car comes back with less, the renter will be billed up to $1.95 a gallon  for the refill.  </P> <P> The new system is already in use in California, Illinois and Hawaii, all of  which have banned mandatory gas charges within the past year. Alamo is the  nation's fifth-largest car rental company and is the largest firm with  mandatory charges.  </P> <P> Some Alamo clients, especially those traveling on business expense accounts,  continue to pay the $11.95 fee and bring the car back nearly empty of fuel,  Clark said. "The customer knows exactly how much the car is going to cost  before he turns the key."  </P> <P> The change was made to put the company "in accord with" the new NAAG  guidelines, Clark said. But the guidelines, intended to serve as a model for  state regulation of the industry, specify only disclosure and do not ask for  eliminating of mandatory gas fees, said Art Weiss, a Kansas deputy attorney  general who assisted in drafting them.  </P> <P> "They may have decided it's easier to make it an option than to advertise it,"  Weiss said.  </P> <P> Three Alamo offices in Britain will retain the mandatory fuel charge, Clark  said.  </P> <P> The Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit against Alamo on Dec. 29 alleging  that in giving price quotes the company failed to disclose either the mandatory  gasoline fee or its airport access surcharges, collected at 13 airports around  the country that have imposed revenue-based fees on rental agencies that do not  rent airport counter space but pick up customers from terminals.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Consent Order  </P> <P> Alamo agreed to a consent order the same day, neither admitting nor denying  wrongdoing, and its sales personnel are now instructed to mention the charges.  Clark said the firm would aggressively promote its new fuel charge plan as  offering consumers a choice that rival firms do not.  </P> <P> Since the Alamo lawsuit, other car rental agencies have begun to mention their  gas fees -- up to $1.99 per gallon at Avis and Hertz -- in printed  advertisements and over the telephone.  </P> <P> The Arizona attorney general's office is suing Hollywood, Fla.-based General  Rent-a-Car, alleging that the company should disclose its mandatory gas fees of  $12 to $13. Officials of General did not return phone calls Friday.  </P></p>

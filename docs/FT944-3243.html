			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / ICI looks outside on pensions: In-house manager may be scrapped as bids sought for Pounds 4.6bn scheme Imperial Chemical Industries is preparing to scrap the in-house manager for its Pounds 4.6bn pension scheme and has asked leading investment fund managers to make presentations to manage the funds externally. If ICI farmed out its entire investment portfolio, it would be the largest 'beauty parade' for external fund managers held in the UK within recent memory. ICI yesterday confirmed that the management of the pension scheme was under review but said no decisions had been made. Several leading fund managers said privately they had been asked to bid for the business. ICI is said to be seeking a core of managers to run 'balanced' portfolios investing in the UK and abroad in shares and bonds and a group of 'specialist' managers who will manage smaller satellite portfolios of investments in discrete geographical regions or special asset classes. Two weeks ago, Zeneca, the drugs company which was demerged from ICI in 1993, formally withdrew its Pounds 1.3bn in pension assets from the ICI Pension Fund, leaving only the property portfolio with the in-house manager. Its new managers are PDFM, Mercury Asset Management, Schroder Investment Management and JP Morgan Investment Management. ICI and Zeneca's pension schemes combined had been the 10th largest scheme in Britain. The decision to review the scheme's management follows the sudden death in the summer of Mr Thomas Heyes, long-time head ICI's investment department, and a wider review of the scheme. ICI, like many other large UK companies, has used its pension scheme to provide early retirement benefits to significant numbers of workers made redundant since the early 1980s. The provision of early retirement benefits has the effect of forcing schemes to crystallise their liabilities, a move which could force them to switch investments out of equities and into bonds. That switch could prompt employers to add additional cash to their schemes because, over time, bonds offer lower total returns than equities. In 1993, ICI and Zeneca together had more than 86,000 current or deferred pensioners and only 38,000 contributing members, according to Pension Funds and Their Advisers, an industry handbook. Its investments are heavily tilted towards equities with nearly 80 per cent of assets in UK or overseas shares. Just over 10 per cent of the schemes' combined assets are in UK or overseas bonds.</p>

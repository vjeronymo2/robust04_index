			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / Parcelforce to get Pounds 250m boost THE GOVERNMENT has sanc-tioned a further Pounds 250m investment programme into the Post Office's loss-making Parcelforce division. The move was revealed as the Post Office yesterday announced that its Datapost letter and document service, which is making a profit, is to be merged into Parcelforce which last year made a loss before tax and exceptional items of Pounds 131m. The Post Office's two other divisions, Royal Mail and Post Office Counters, both made profits. Overall the Post Office last year made a profit before tax and exceptional items of Pounds 30m. Earlier in the year Parcelforce received approval from the Department of Trade and Industry to invest Pounds 250m over five years in eight new automated sorting centres. About Pounds 50m has already been invested in Parcelforce. The DTI said that the fresh Pounds 250m investment would come from the Post Office - possibly from cashflow as pre-tax profits had been just Pounds 30m. Mr Peter Howarth, managing director of Parcelforce, said the merger with Datapost - which guarantees a next-day service - would significantly reduce Parcelforce's losses and would mean it was expected to be back in the black by 1992-93. Parcelforce is to publish its own accounts for the first time when the Post Office produces its reports and accounts in July. The new Parcelforce service will offer customers guaranteed deliveries for 10am and noon the next day, as well as access to Parcelforce's standard services - which take between three and five days - throughout the Post Office network. Customers will now be offered a 25 per cent price differential between the 10am and noon services. The former will cost Pounds 17.20 and the latter Pounds 13. The average price for a parcel will remain Pounds 2.70. The merger will lead to a net loss of 100 jobs which the Post Office expects to come from voluntary redundancies.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Since April of this year, Guangxi has carried out a  regionwide commodities prices examination and achieved some  initial results in connection.    By early May, Guangxi had investigated a total of 1,427  price-related cases, confiscated illicit incomes totaling 27.62  million yuan, handled a total of 1,043 price-related cases, and  collected price-related fines totaling 2.4 million yuan.    In view of a series of problems exposed during the region's  commodities prices examination, including an unbalanced  crackdown on price-related cases, ineffective measures against  price-related cases, slack regulation and control of daily  necessities and services prices, and so on, the regional  people's government held a regional prices examination work  conference in Nanning on 9 June.    Liu Xueyue, regional people's government secretary general,  said in his speech to the conference that the second-stage of  the regional commodities prices examination will be directed at  certain basic daily necessities, production means, and services  prices, including grain, chemical fertilizer, agricultural goods  and materials, electricity, and so on.    With regard to grain and other basic necessity prices, Liu  noted that conscientious efforts should be made to implement the  state grain prices reform plan and relevant measures, market  prices control measures, and so on. The whole region should  strictly control price hikes, especially those relating to bus  and train fares; prohibit enterprises and operators from raising  chemical fertilizer prices, agricultural goods and materials  prices, and electricity prices without state approval; and  prohibit enterprises and operators from altering state guidance  prices as well as other prices set by the state, such as, prices  set by the State Council or the regional people's government.  Moreover, Liu stated that the whole region should strive to  implement to the letter a series of preferential prices set by  the state for farm and sideline products and prohibit relevant  units from raising basic services prices, such as, rent, water  prices, electricity prices, bus fares, and telephone charges.</p>

			<p><P> July 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: LAST LETTERS PRISONS &amp; PRISONERS OF THE FRENCH  REVOLUTION BY OLIVER BLANC (FARRAR, STRAUS &amp; GIROUX: $9.95)  </P> <P> Working from a cache of prisoners' letters that were confiscated by officials,  Oliver Blanc compares conditions in the Parisian jails and offers brief  portraits of people who were executed for alleged counterrevolutionary  activities. His subjects range from Marie Antoinette, the dethroned queen of  France to middle- and lower-class citizens.  </P> <P> Whether the writers acknowledge their guilt or protest their innocence, the  recurring theme of the letters is "remember me." It might have comforted these  unhappy men and women to know that 200 years later, people would read their  pleas and remember. A welcome antidote to the gaudy celebrations of the  bicentennial of the French Revolution.  </P></p>

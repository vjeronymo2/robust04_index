			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Queens Moat under fire Rebel shareholders in Queens Moat Houses yesterday accused the heavily indebted hotels group of breaching company law by not calling an annual meeting within the required time. Mr Dennis Woodhams of the QMH Shareholders Action Group said failure to call the AGM could mean there is at least one director 'not properly a director of the company'. 'All directors have been appointed by the board itself since the 1992 AGM, which was the last one validly to elect or re-elect directors,' he said. 'Consequently there is no director who has been elected by shareholders.' Queens Moat rejected Mr Woodhams' suggestions that it had breached company law: 'We are happy to reassure Mr Woodhams that the timing of the AGM is perfectly in order and it will be held before the end of this year.'</p>

			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Immune Response Corp. Plans Offering: The San Diego biotechnology company  co-founded by Jonas Salk, which is trying to develop an AIDS vaccine, has filed  for permission to hold an 2.2-million-share initial public stock offering to  raise as much as $19.8 million. Now in advanced clinical trials at several  medical centers, the firm's vaccine aims at stimulating patients' immune  response systems to prevent the disease from progressing to full-blown AIDS.  The company had planned to go public last fall, but the offering was called off  after the stock market soured.  </P></p>

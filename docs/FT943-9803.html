			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Sales expansion and cost control behind Inspec rise Inspec Group, the speciality chemicals company which came to the market earlier this year, yesterday announced a sharp increase in first-half profits following strong volume growth and tight cost controls. Pre-tax profits more than doubled from Pounds 2.85m to Pounds 6.91m in the six months to June 30, on sales ahead 46 per cent at Pounds 35m (Pounds 23.9m) Mr John Hollowood, chairman, said the outcome demonstrated the group's progress since its March flotation, which raised Pounds 49.5m. The figures were flattered, however, by Pounds 1.05m of exceptional gains following early repayment of a vendor loan to BP Chemicals - the group's former owners - and by first-time contributions from Allco, the US speciality acids business acquired last December for Dollars 20m (Pounds 12.9m). Although the group declined to reveal the exact size of Allco's profits, analysts estimated it contributed about Pounds 500,000 to increased operating profits of Pounds 6.41m (Pounds 3.54m). On a pro forma basis - assuming Allco had been acquired at the beginning of 1993 - operating profits rose 30 per cent from Pounds 4.92m. Mr Hollowood said the improvement had been underpinned by increased demand in its three core areas: coating intermediaries, synthetic lubricants, and Allco's speciality acids. 'Allco has turned out to be a real gem,' he added. 'But there's been strong organic growth; we've increased capacity and kept a tight control on fixed costs.' The group also plans to exploit sustained growth in Britain and the US by investing Pounds 5m on new facilities at its Hythe plant near Southampton and Dollars 5m on increased capacity at Allco in Kansas. Earnings per share came out at 6.9p - 5.5p excluding exceptional items  - and an interim dividend of 1.33p is declared. The shares, floated at 160p, closed up 3p at 231p.</p>

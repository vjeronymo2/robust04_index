			<p><P> February 14, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT : POP MUSIC;  </P> <P> UNKNOWNS GET ON TRACK AT COZY HILLCREST CAFE  </P> <P> The San Diego pop-music community could use more people like Georgia Bankston.  Last October, the 42-year-old former Alaska pipeline worker pooled her  resources and opened Uptown Sound in Hillcrest, a combination record store and  coffeehouse that provides local pop fans with a badly needed alternative to the  Top 40 bar scene.  </P> <P> Every Friday, Saturday and Sunday night, there's live music in the Soundtrax  Cafe, which occupies the back half of the store. The spotlight is on  up-and-coming home-grown talent outside of the nightclub mainstream. Regular  performers include piano man Bill Harris, jazz piano-vocal duo Turiya and Joe  Garrison, and singer-guitarist Jill Warren, a thin, peroxide-blonde in torn  jeans who last Saturday night delivered a compelling two-hour set of folk and  country standards.  </P> <P> Every other Wednesday is "Open Mike Night," with a dozen or so amateurs  commanding the stage between 8 and 10 p.m., for a song or two apiece.  </P> <P> "I have jazz, blues, rock, folk and country musicians," Bankston said. "A lot  of people who come to me are interested in playing here because they can't get  exposure anywhere else, and because it's a totally different environment from  the bars.  </P> <P> "They're not into the Top 40, and many of them are unknown, but if you come  here on a number of weekends, you'll find there's a lot of talent out there,  just waiting to be discovered."  </P> <P> In the four months that Uptown Sound has been open, Bankston said, concert  attendance has steadily increased -- to the point where two weeks ago, the  Soundtrax Cafe's seating capacity was more than doubled, to 90.  </P> <P> Delaney Bramlett will be back at the Belly Up Tavern in Solana Beach on  Saturday night, a little more than a month after his first appearance there in  several years.  </P> <P> Like John Mayall, Bramlett is best remembered for the company he keeps -- or,  rather, the company he kept. In 1969, he and his wife, Bonnie Lynn, toured as  Delaney and Bonnie and Friends. The "friends" included several L.A. studio  players and occasionally had such celebrated sidemen as Eric Clapton, George  Harrison, Dave Mason, Leon Russell, Rita Coolidge and Duane Allman.  </P> <P> A year later, Clapton left, and most of the non-celebrity "friends" were hired  away by Russell to tour with Joe Cocker's Mad Dogs and Englishmen. Delaney and  Bonnie made four more albums together -- fusing gospel, country, funk and rock  -- and scored two hits in 1971, "Never Ending Song of Love" and the  Mason-penned "Only You Know and I Know."  </P> <P> The husband-and-wife duo broke up in 1973, the same year their marriage  dissolved; Delaney Bramlett subsequently released several albums but never  quite found his way back into the spotlight.  </P> <P> Several half-hearted comeback attempts later, Mississippi native Bramlett  finally seems serious: he's recently formed a 10-piece band, Warhorse, and  there's a possibility he'll be opening for Fleetwood Mac on their upcoming  world tour.  </P> <P> LINER NOTES: Eric Clapton will be making his first San Diego appearance in  nearly a decade May 3, at the Sports Arena. Tickets will go on sale in late  March. . . .  </P> <P> Tickets go on sale today at 10 a.m. for the L.A. Guns' March 10 concert at  Iguanas in Tijuana, and for Sam Kinison's Feb. 24 double-header at the  Bacchanal in Kearny Mesa. . . .  </P> <P> Phil Quinn, executive vice president and general manager of the San Diego  Sports Arena, is in Palm Springs this week, attending the 1990 Performance  magazine summit. The annual parley brings together booking agents, managers,  concert promoters, record-company representatives and facility operators from  around the country. This year, the arena is sponsoring the closing night  "Readers Poll Awards Dinner." . . .  </P> <P> Best concert bets for the coming week: Dr. Hook and the Medicine Show with the  Premieres, tonight at Mr. D's in El Cajon; the Dynatones, tonight at the Belly  Up Tavern; Laurie Anderson, Thursday at Symphony Hall downtown; the Sugarcubes  with the Primitives, Thursday at the California Theater downtown; the Desert  Rose Band with Travis Tritt, Thursday at the Bacchanal; the Kentucky  Headhunters with the Savery Brothers, Thursday at the Belly Up Tavern; Melissa  Etheridge with Webb Wilder, Friday at the California Theater; Soundgarden with  Voi Vod, Friday at Iguanas; Tower of Power, Saturday at the Bacchanal; El Vez,  Saturday at the Spirit in Bay Park; the Fuzztones, Saturday at Rio's in Loma  Portal; and Deborah Harry, Feb. 20 at Symphony Hall.  </P></p>

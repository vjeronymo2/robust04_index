			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Management (The Growing Business): How to get the best out of your local MP Businesses should not underestimate the ability of their local Member of Parliament to influence legislation or to take action on their behalf, writes Charles Batchelor. Even if he or she is not a minister or a member of one of the influential standing or select committees, the MP will be able to raise questions and put points directly to ministers. 'It is worth remembering that your company is a creator of wealth and employment within a constituency and the well-being of your company is therefore of importance to your MP,' a handbook* to lobbying Westminster by the London Chamber of Commerce points out. If you have a concern to raise with your MP, the best way to make initial contact is by letter to the House of Commons (London SW1A 0AA). If you want to express your views on a particular piece of legislation, try to do so as early as possible in the parliamentary process. The best time is when the government issues a Green Paper or consultation document. Give your MP as much information as possible. If you fear a new law would cause job losses or extra expense for your company, spell out how many jobs might go and the extent of any extra costs. If you do not want your MP to mention your company's name, say so. If your concerns have a European dimension, you may wish to contact your MEP. He or she may be less familiar to you but you can get addresses and details of special committees from the European Parliament Information Office, 2 Queen Anne's Gate, London SW1H 9AA. (Tel 071 222 0411.) Your MEP will be able to put down a written or oral question, drawing the attention of the European Commission or the Council of Ministers to your concerns. The booklet suggests a number of simple rules when writing to your MP: Identify the subject you are interested in clearly at the start of your letter. Describe the background to your company - the length of time it has been based in the constituency and the number of people employed. Keep the letter as short as possible. MPs have a heavy postbag. End by asking your MP's position on the matter. If possible, suggest a solution to the issue you have raised. Above all, adopt a friendly tone. However angry you may be about a particular issue, it is pointless blaming or insulting your MP. The title of the booklet, Working with Westminster and Whitehall, is somewhat misleading since it does not actually look at how to lobby civil servants. It does, however, include useful lists of the membership of select committees and the names, policy priorities and points of contact for the different government departments. Some of the information, on, for example, London MEPs is probably only of value to London-based companies but the general advice is applicable to all businesses. *London Chamber of Commerce and Industry, 69 Cannon Street, London EC4N 5AB.

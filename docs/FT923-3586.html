			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / BMA will not fight London hospitals axe GOVERNMENT proposals to close some of London's most famous hospitals will not be obstructed by the British Medical Association even though many doctors' jobs will disappear. At a meeting this week with Dr Brian Mawhinney, health minister, BMA leaders accepted the case for hospital closures and concentrated on trying to ensure that they take place in a planned and orderly way. A report by Sir Bernard Tomlinson, former chairman of the Northern Regional Health Authority, on hospital provision in London is due to reach the government by the end of next month. With Sir Bernard's deadline for completing his study approaching, speculation is mounting over which hospitals might close. A report in the London Evening Standard yesterday said that the Tomlinson report would lead to the disappearance of St Thomas', St Bartholomew's, Charing Cross and the combined University College-Middlesex hospitals in their present form. Mr John Chawner, chairman of the BMA consultants committee, said the association recognised that there had to be change in London hospital provision. 'It has to be properly managed and planned around a sensible timetable.' The big London teaching hospitals are in increasing financial difficulty now that, under the government's health reforms introduced last year, health authorities outside the capital have greater incentives to treat patients locally. In addition, Mr Chawner said, they were experiencing 'planning blight' as a result of the Tomlinson inquiry. Health authorities were reluctant to place contracts with a hospital that might be earmarked for closure. Doctors in London estimate that between 600 and 700 consultant posts, plus the jobs of numerous other junior medical staff, are likely to disappear as a result of the Tomlinson rationalisation. Plans to close famous London hospitals are certain to meet opposition from their staff, but BMA leaders will not back individual hospital campaigns. They will concentrate their energies on issues arising out of the closures. Those include: Opening up opportunities in other parts of the country for medical staff who lose their jobs in London. Protecting the future of specialist clinical and research units housed in teaching hospitals selected for closure. Ensuring that the surviving hospitals contain a proper balance of services to meet the needs of the capital. The position adopted by the BMA even before the Tomlinson report has been published shows the extent to which the new financial structure of the government's health reforms has undermined the London teaching hospitals. London has proportionately more hospital beds than the rest of the country. Mr Chawner said the government had recognised decisions could not be based on the failure of particular hospital managers to balance their books, and had to be properly planned.</p>

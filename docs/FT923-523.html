			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / Arts: Today's Television Time was when it was fields of yellow rape which made the environmentally concerned townie sound off. Now, it is the sight of fields deep in dock and nettles which makes one hiss through clenched teeth, 'set aside'. BBC 1's Panorama (9.30) analyses that ultimate affront to the Protestant work ethic, paying farmers Pounds 84 an acre to let the weeds grow, plus the affront to Darwinianism of keeping unprofitable Yorkshire hill-farmers in business. Not, of course, that farmers are necessarily keeping afloat. If you can bear to watch, 'Going Bust', on ITV's World in Action (8.30) is about just that - the bitter experiences of those who have seen their businesses go down the drain. Out of Darkness, BBC 2's interesting series on African affairs, this week looks north to Algeria (7.50). It examines the roots of the political and economic crisis, which is fraught with menace for the EC's southern fringe. A million Algerians died in the fight to win freedom from France, and Algeria looked like a viable Islamic and socialist society as long as the oil revenues were there. Now, since the murder of Mohammed Boudiaf in July, Algeria's neighbours must hold their breath.</p>

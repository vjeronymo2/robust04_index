			<p>920111 FT  11 JAN 92 / Books: Friend to the famous - From Nabokov to Tolkien, the FT critics review the most interesting of the recently published volumes of biography and memoir / Sybil Colefax A PASSION FOR FRIENDSHIP: SIBYL COLEFAX AND HER CIRCLE by Kirsty McLeod Michael Joseph Pounds 20, 180 pages 'IF I dine with you, I shan't sleep; if I don't sleep, I cant write. You say this dont matter a straw. I quite agree with you. But my next year's income depends on sending a book to America in August. It aint half done, owing to dining out. So theres no more to be said.' The date is 1931. The handwriting - with its odd lack of apostrophes - is that of Virginia Woolf. The recipient? Lady Sybil Colefax. On receiving a refusal couched in those terms, most people would be inclined to delete the writer's name from future guest-lists. Sibyl's reaction was the opposite - to send Virginia three further invitations for other dinner-parties. Eventually Virginia caved in and became a friend of hers. A friend? Yes, but the kind of friend you make fun of behind her back to your real friends, the kind of friend you do your best to put off when she invites herself to stay with you in the country: 'Dearest Sibyl, Yes delighted Thursday 8th but, (1) View is ruined (2) No room for chauffeur in house (3) The smallest possible doghole for you (4) Village char is cook Let me know if you are daunted. If not, whether we shall meet a train: if so, which. Yours in haste (not hate) Virginia No clothes but nightgowns worn here.' Poor Sibyl] But if her friends often were bitchy about her, biographers have been kinder, pointing to the heart of gold beneath the absurdities, to the core of loyalty in friendship, masked by Sibyl's indefatigable collector's instinct for the famous. Brian Masters had a judicious chapter on her in his book Great Hostesses (1982) where Sibyl emerged as positively saintly beside the likes of Mrs Ronnie Greville and Emerald Cunard. Now Kirsty McLeod has filled the portrait out more fully. Sibyl Halsey was born in 1874, daughter of an Indian civil servant. The first great man Sibyl encountered was Lockwood Kipling, Rudyard's father. The Kipling connection remained firm after Sibyl had grown up and become a great hostess of London society. A young woman of her ambitious temperament, desirous of moving in the world of celebrities, might have been expected to marry a genius, or a perhaps a title, but Sibyl was shrewder than that. She found her fate in Arthur Colefax, a grammar school boy who became an eminent lawyer, then an MP, and was knighted for his work running the scientific side of the manufacture of munitions in the First World War. They occupied a grand house in the King's Road, Chelsea, where Sibyl entertained almost everyone of any eminence. At the height of her career in the 1930s her regular guests included HG Wells, Maynard Keynes, JL Garvin, Oswald Mosley, Robert Bruce Lockhart, John Gielgud, Edward Lutyens, Gerald Berners, Artur Rubinstein, Roger Fry, Noel Coward, Andre Maurois, Alfred Beit, Desmond MacCarthy, Gertrude Lawrence, Brendan Bracken, Mrs Churchill, Alexander Korda, Lord Beaverbrook, the Duke of Buccleuch, Rebecca West, the Mountbattens, the Dufferins, the Jebbs, the Wellesleys - to list but a few of the names in Sibyl's Visitor's Book. Sibyl's success may in part be ascribed to her persistence, to the immense trouble she took, and to her flair for invariably producing the man or woman of the moment - 'Paul Valery will be in London on Tuesday. Do come along and meet him' - but one gathers there was more to it than simply her ability to deliver the goods. Sibyl had great courage. She was fiercely anti-appeasement. Above all she was someone in whom you could safely confide. When the King's mistress, Mrs Simpson, had to decide whether or not to abandon her beloved, it was to her friend Sibyl that she turned for support. The full correspondence between Sibyl and the Duchess of Windsor has not yet been published. After it was all over, Osbert Sitwell, one of Sibyl's enemies, lampooned her in his poem Rat Week. 'Coalbox' was what the malicious Sitwells always called her. At the same time Sibyl suffered serious private adversity. Her husband's increasing deafness, coupled with unwise investments in the US, led to the almost total loss of their income. Now Sibyl showed her pluck and resilience. Following the lead of other women in society like Syrie Maugham, Sibyl set herself up professionally as an interior decorator. She joined forces with the furniture-maker John Fowler to found the firm Colefax and Fowler which still exists today. A smaller house in Westminster proved less satisfactory for her parties, but she carried on regardless. Even another world war could not stifle her compulsion to entertain. By now a widow, Sibyl made the Dorchester Hotel her wartime centre of operations; she would send each of her guests a bill to meet his share of the evening's cost. Everyone paid without a murmur. Sibyl's Ordinaries - as these parties were called - were one of the more bizarre manifestations of well-bred defiance to the rigours of the London blitz. Sibyl survived the war, but died of cancer in 1950. Kirsty McLeod certainly convinces us in this short readable book that Sibyl deserved more than the footnote biographers usually give her.</p>

			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Italy (5): Protest vote may spur action - Institutional Reform ALL TOO often, Italian politicians' ability to talk about problems has been the direct opposite of their capacity to solve them. On no issue has this been so evident as that of institutional reform. The process of electing governments and governing Italy has progressively become more unworkable. Every party has suggested remedies; but nothing has been done. Any such reforms attack the heart of the system of privilege and power which has been consolidated under Christian Democrat hegemony since the Second World War. The issue is finally being forced onto the political agenda from two opposite directions. One set of pressures is coming from an ever-more disillusioned electorate whose large protest vote in April demonstrated that the existing system of proportional representation had reached the limits of its viability. No fewer than 16 parties are represented in the new parliament of which 12 each gained less than 7 per cent of the vote, and only one (the Christian Democrats) more than 20 per cent. From another direction comes the impact of the cross-party referendum movement. This is an odd alliance of politicians, backed by the public's referendum signatures, who see parliament incapable of reforming the state and therefore are resorting to referendums to do the job instead. Significantly, it is led by a dissident Christian Democrat, Mr Mario Segni. Next year Italy could face up to 10 referendums on a variety of topics whose combined effect would alter radically the formal functioning of the state. Already the movement has managed, via a referendum in June 1991, to abolish the system of multi-preference votes which was much abused in the corrupt constituencies of southern Italy. Institutional reform is short-hand for a shake-up of a wide range of aspects of government and governance. It spans altering the system of proportional representation for parliamentary elections, the possibility of direct elections to the presidency, more autonomy for the regions and the introduction of direct elections for mayors. The most urgent concerns reforming proportional representation so that Italians possess a process which produces more stable governments. In this way Italians would vote for governments with clear programmes instead of the present vote for a party, an uncertain alliance and an ill-prepared programme. The existing system provides excessive guarantees to minority groups which in turn permits the political scene to be over-fragmented and obliges governments to be formed from coalitions. The country is divided up into 32 electoral colleges which provide the 630 deputies and 315 senators. Seats are awarded in the following way. The total votes in each college is first added and then divided by the total number of seats plus two - an equation which gives the electoral 'quotient'. This quotient represents the number of votes each party must obtain to win a seat. Usually, it is impossible to allocate all seats in this manner (between 16 and 20 remain). To fill these seats, the remaining votes in excess of each party's quotient - or the entire vote if a party has failed to reach the requisite quotient - are transferred to a national electoral college where a new quotient is worked out. Thus small parties may gain no seat in the regional electoral colleges but with their votes carried forward into the national college they stand a good chance; because at this stage the number of their votes is usually greater than the larger parties. The Christian Democrats have proposed to retain this system for 555 seats (88 per cent) in the chamber of deputies. The remainder would be awarded as a 'majority premium' to the party, or the pre-electoral coalition, with the highest number of votes. The aim of the 'majority premium' would be to give the main party or coalition a stable majority. The coalition would have to be clearly defined in advance. Their Socialist allies approach the problem of unstable governments from a different angle by introducing a minimum threshold vote of 5 per cent in at least half the electoral colleges. This would encourage the smaller parties to form coalitions; but it discriminates against regional parties. If applied on the April results, this formula would have excluded seven parties who won a total of 100 seats in the chamber of deputies. In addition, the Lombard League, which became the second largest party in northern Italy and obtained 9 per cent of the national vote, would have been excluded because its vote was unevenly spread. The former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) has favoured a procedure whereby deputies who failed to obtain a majority vote on the first round must go to a second round. Others have talked more of a first-past-the-post system as in the UK. One of the referendums currently being considered by the courts is a move to introduce a first-past-the-post system for two-thirds of the senate. Virtually all the parties are agreed on the need to redefine the respective roles of the chamber and senate. The two have been assigned similar but not complementary roles and this merely impedes the legislative process. More authority would be vested in the chamber. Another reform concerns the system of electing the president. He is elected by parliament, the successful candidate being the product of back-stage deals between the parties. He is thus dependent upon the goodwill of the parties, rather than the nation as a whole. The party bosses recognise that a quicker system needs to be introduced - last month's election of President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro was on the 16th attempt (the record is 23). Others want to see the president directly elected, accountable to the voters, not the parties, with more real presidential authority and a cut in the seven-year term. At present the president's principal powers are to nominate a prime minister and dissolve parliament. But these functions have been in effect controlled by the main parties, as has the composition of the cabinet. For a more efficient government, the prime minister also has to feel free to choose his own team and then be answerable to parliament for his programme. This margin of manoeuvre is being conceded for the first time to Professor Giuliano Amato. If it lasts, it could be an important element in the parties being pushed away from the affairs of state. The great barrier to institutional reform is the way the political parties have become entwined in the apparatus of state. The activities of party and government are often indistinguishable, and the situation has deteriorated as party bureaucracies have swollen. This has been made appallingly clear by the Milan municipal corruption scandal. A pattern of illegal party funding has emerged on the basis of bribes from rigged public contracts. This was encouraged by the nature of local government which has under its sway a large number of state and para-state bodies handling big contracts such as the local health organisations, the local public transport companies and the airport authorities. The boards of these bodies have been stacked with the party faithful. On one guestimate, over 100,000 people depend directly on political parties. The PDS, which now has only 16 per cent of the vote, employs over 1,750 full-time staff - by comparison the UK Labour party employs only 50. After the Milan corruption scandal, the parties may well feel obliged to withdraw their members from the boards of these local bodies to demonstrate they are cleaning up their act. Tighter control of state spending and greater transparency automatically would expose party free-loading and the soto governo (under-the-table government). But such measures would in themselves require a new approach to local government. At present, local government expenditures are agreed annually in the national budget; but with both the local authorities and the government knowing perfectly well the figures are understated. The local authorities are merely spending agencies with virtually no autonomy to raise their own funds and with no penalties for overspending, as invariably happens. If local government were to be reformed by permitting greater autonomy, with direct elections for the mayors and penalties for overspending, as proposed by the new government, this would go some way to correct existing abuses.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Wang Yunfeng (3769 0061 1496) and Shi Meisi </F> (0670 5019 3128)]    [Text] Guangzhou, 4 May (XINHUA) -- During his 29 April-3  May inspection tour of Guangdong Province, Li Lanqing, member of  the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and State Council  vice premier, pointed out: Foreign trade enjoys good prospects  this year, but what deserves our attention is the fact that  costs of producing export-oriented goods are increasing fairly  rapidly. It is necessary to take severe measures to ban the  practices of rushing for raw materials at high prices and  competing for market share by lowering commodity prices;  otherwise, such practices will severely affect the sustained  power of our exports. The Ministry of Foreign Trade and  Economic Cooperation has achieved very good results in inviting  bids for 10 or more export commodities this year, which helps  curb such ill practices. It is necessary to sum up these  experiences and spread them as soon as possible. Meanwhile, it  is imperative to take effective measures to prevent the loss,  especially the nonnoticeable loss, of the property of  state-owned foreign trade enterprises. It is necessary to  invigorate them through reform and to ensure that state-owned  property maintains and increases its value. The key to  achieving this goal lies in changing enterprises' management  mechanism. He expressed his hope that the banking sector will  provide the necessary circulating funds for those foreign trade  enterprises with good export earnings and economic performances.  The areas with good achievements in carrying out the policy of  reform and opening should take active measures to further  improve the investment environment, particularly the intangible  environment, so as to explore new ways to develop foreign trade  and to attract foreign funds.    Accompanied by Xie Fei, member of the CPC Central Committee  Political Bureau and secretary of Guangdong Province; Guangdong  Provincial Governor Zhu Senlin; and Wu Yi, minister of the  Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation; and relevant  leaders of the State Economic and Trade Commission, Li Lanqing  inspected the 75th Guangzhou Trade Fair, the Huangpu customs  office, and the Huangpu bonded zone. He heard reports made by  responsible comrades of Zhuhai and Zhongshan cities on the work  of improving foreign trade and attracting foreign funds. He  inspected the new airport in Zhongshan city. In addition, he  conducted a comprehensive study of some reform measures to be  carried out this year.    Li Lanqing said: To build a basic framework for our  socialist market economy, the central authorities have come up  with many major measures for reforming the systems governing  fiscal affairs, taxation, banking operations, modern business  operations, investment, foreign trade, and foreign exchange.  The performance in the first four months shows that the  implementation of these measures has been quite stable. The  problems we have encountered today are not caused by reforms but  rather are the old system's defects that have been exposed by  reforms. To deal with these problems, we must count on  deepening reforms and replacing the operating mechanisms, and  not by retreating, which has no way out. Leading authorities at  all levels must consider how to reinvigorate state-owned  enterprises as an important issue and place it high on their  agendas. Li Lanqing listened attentively to everybody's ideas  for reinvigorating state-owned enterprises, especially  state-owned foreign trade enterprises, and he discussed the  ideas with them.    On special economic zones' future development, Li Lanqing  pointed out: After 15 years, special economic zones have  undergone major changes from enjoying preferential treatment and  flexible measures -- such as paying lower taxes but retaining  more profits -- to improving their own operating mechanisms and  accumulating more capital for development. In order to remain  special, our special economic zones must continue to improve  their investment environment, especially the intangibles  environment, in accordance with international norms. To attract  more investment from large consortia and transnational companies  in accordance with China's development strategy and industrial  policy, special zones must use foreign capital more efficiently  and on more technologically advanced projects. Meanwhile,  special economic zones should take the lead in launching pilot  reform projects and adopting good foreign experiences useful for  China.    Li Lanqing was highly interested in educational investment  and teachers' pay, especially their housing situation. Passing  through a residential housing area in Zhongshan city, he  demanded to visit the home of a retired teacher. He was glad to  see that because of the government's preferential treatment, the  teacher had living quarters in which each member of his family  had on average more than 13 square meters of floor space. He  fully acknowledged the city's experiences in solving teachers'  housing problems. At a meeting with leaders of Jinan  University, Li Lanqing stressed that universities should proceed  with reforms with the objective of achieving higher academic  quality and better educational results. He said that  universities should explore a new way to arouse the enthusiasm  of all quarters and promote educational cooperation at home and  abroad, and universities should make greater efforts to train  versatile personnel useful for the development of the market  economy -- personnel who are knowledgeable about the economy as  well as about industrial technologies. While the government is  increasing investment in education, he said, schools must also  speed up their reforms. Li Lanqing praised Guangdong for its  attention to education in recent years.    Li Lanqing also mentioned that smuggling activities must be  cracked down on with protracted efforts and on a regular basis,  and that bonded zones must do a good job in providing storage  service, handling indirect trade, and processing supplied  materials according to international norms.</p>

			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Govett offers a 7% yield A NEW international investment trust, with a yield of 7 per cent paid quarterly, is being launched by fund management group John Govett. It will invest in an unusual mix of UK equities, high-yielding international bonds and emerging markets. The aim of the Govett High Income investment trust will to give investors a high and steadily rising income with the potential for long term capital growth. The bulk of the income will come from the bond portfolio. which will buy government bonds in developed countries such as Italy and Spain but also in such emerging markets as South Africa, Mexico and Turkey. Yields on Turkish government bonds are around 81 per cent, so obviously this is a high risk area. But Govett argues that emerging market debt should benefit from the same factors that have caused so many to buy emerging market equities. Economic liberalisation and increased capital inflows will improve the credit rating of emerging countries and encourage them to adopt anti-inflation policies. Therefore, says Govett, the risk premium on the debt of these countries will contract, giving investors above-average returns. As evidence, Govett cites figures for the year to September 30. The return on Turkish bonds, in local currency terms, was 77.2 per cent. Although the Turkish lira fell by 43.2 per cent against the pound, the net return to sterling-based investors was still a healthy 23.9 per cent. Only 34 per cent of the portfolio will be in international bonds (and just 4 per cent in Turkey). Around 14 per cent will be in emerging market equities, which will be expected to provide capital growth. The remaining 52 per cent of the portfolio will be in higher-yielding UK equities, with a particular emphasis on smaller and medium-sized companies. This particular combination of investments reflects the areas which Govett believes are attractive at present. The managers will have the flexibility to change the investment strategy; however, a minimum of 50 per cent of the portfolio will be kept in UK equities to ensure the trust qualifies for Pep status. Full details will be available in November but the trust will have a 10-year life. Its 7 per cent yield will attract income-seeking investors, but they should be aware of the risk profile.</p>

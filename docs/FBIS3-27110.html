The region embraces three cities of Suzhou, Wuxi and  Changzhou.    Township enterprises, the mainstay of the local economy,  brought in 280 billion yuan in output value last year,  accounting for 70 percent of the province's total.    On the other hand, high efficiency has helped reduce farming  population to 9 million, with each farmer bringing in about 100  kg of grain per year from land averaging 0.05 ha per person.    So far, all 12 counties in the region have edged into the  country's 100 economically powerful counties, with four among  the top six. They are Wuxi, Jiangyin, Zhangjiagang and Changshu.    The introduction of the joint stock system in 1993 is viewed  as a key to the region's success.    By the end of 1993, around 90 percent of partnership  enterprises the provincial-level enterprises groups were born in  the area, together with over 6,500 foreign-funded enterprises.    Suzhou City, whose township industry grossed 80 billion yuan  in sales and 20 billion yuan in exports, has converted 4,025 of  its 12,000 township firms into joint ventures.    At present, more than 90 percent of the existing 430 towns  under these three cities have risen to become multi-million-yuan  towns.    The township enterprises have subsidized farm production at  an annual average of over 200 million yuan since 1990. Last  year, the figure reached 360 million yuan.    The degree of farm mechanization in some of its cities and  counties has reached the level of developed countries.    A comprehensive system of farming services has been  coordinated throughout the region, ranging from plant protection  and irrigation to seed and fertilizer supplication.    All-round services have reduced heavy field labor by 70  percent and farmers have higher income than most workers of  enterprises.    At present, farmers in the region have contracted for  cultivated land of more than 33,350 ha from the collectives,  accounting for 15 percent of land for planting cash crops.</p>

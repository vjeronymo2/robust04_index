			<p><P> April 27, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> LIFE, ART BLEND IN 'CINEMA PARADISO';  </P> <P> OSCAR WINNER: NOSTALGIC ITALIAN FILM TELLS OF A YOUNGSTER'S LOVE AFFAIR WITH  THE MOVIES AND HOW IT SHAPED HIS ADULT LIFE.  </P> <P> The cinema, Jean Cocteau once said, is the only art form that shows death at  work -- and death, time and our love for films are the subjects of Giuseppe  Tornatore's "Cinema Paradiso" (at the Cove Theater in La Jolla).  </P> <P> It's a shining valentine to the movies -- full of homages, collages and  swooningly romantic Ennio Morricone music -- and it gets right at the messy,  impure, wondrous way they capture and enrapture us. It's a film about why  people love movies, how they can both break our hearts and lift them up again.  </P> <P> Winner of the Oscar for best foreign-language film, "Cinema Paradiso" is set  mostly in a small Sicilian fishing village in the '40s and '50s, recalled by a  man journeying back for the funeral of an old friend. It's an almost  unabashedly sentimental film. But, in a way, that fits. Movies, in general, are  a crowd-pleasing, impure art, and the movies we see here -- though sometimes  great classics -- are messily and happily involved with the day-to-day lives of  the people who watch them.  </P> <P> For all its dramatic flaws, "Cinema" becomes a cascade of wonders on the  screen, enlivened by its great central image: the wonderful old Paradiso  theater, a cross between a village church and a sleazy bijou, set in a Sicilian  village square. The film follows two lives dominated by the Paradiso: the  child, Salvatore Di Vitta, whose obsession leads to adult vocation as a film  director, and his mentor and paterfamilias, Alfredo, the Paradiso's Rabelaisian  projectionist (Philippe Noiret).  </P> <P> Young Salvatore, nicknamed Toto, is played with brio and ebullience by an  8-year-old Sicilian, Salvatore Cascio: a flashing-eyed imp with an entrancing  smile and a sneaky streak. The teen-age Salvatore (Marco Leonardi) is a  petulant juvenile who spends much of his time mooning over a young girl of  "superior" social class, whose image he first catches in a movie camera. The  elder Salvatore (played by Jacques Perrin, once the charming juvenile of "The  Sleeping Car Murders" and "Z") is a gray-haired urban sophisticate, a  bed-hopping bachelor who has, apparently, avoided his town and mother for 30  years, though Rome is only an hour away by plane.  </P> <P> While the movies open up the world for Salvatore, they close it down for  Alfredo. They seal him up in a hot, tiny, dangerous cubicle where he is  condemned to watch the same images over and over, talking with phantoms; where  he must -- under the prudish dictates of the local priest -- snip out every  kissing scene from every film.  </P> <P> In an accident, the movies actually turn on him, blinding him when the nitrate  ignites and burns down the theater, ironically at a moment when Toto's  namesake, the great Italian clown, is cavorting on film. When Alfredo loses the  movies, he has only Toto -- who becomes his successor, the new projectionist --  and his memories. And the movies, and the lure of the city, take Toto from him  too.  </P> <P> In a way, the older Salvatore is a man shaped by the new cinema, a product of  the old movie palaces who's adapted himself to the era of the VCR and the  multiplex. But Alfredo -- as Noiret memorably and beautifully plays him -- is  the soul of the old cinema. He's intimately involved with the "Golden Age," the  black-and-white movies of the '20s-'40s, and, playing him, Noiret summons up  the image of the great beefy French character actors of the period, the Raimus  and Michel Simons. When he dies, the Cinema Paradiso does too, torn down on the  same weekend as Alfredo's funeral. Videos and TV, both of which Salvatore  probably directs, have killed it.  </P> <P> Tornatore began as an award-winning photographer and he's stronger on imagery  than psychology, on the film past than the real-life present. The spirit of  Fellini hovers over the movie house and the city square, Antonioni over the  chilly, bare Rome apartments and Visconti over the seascapes. This 33-year-old  film maker may actually have given too much of himself to the 53-year-old  Salvatore, who acts more like an alienated young bachelor. Perhaps the movie's  main flaw is the way Tornatore lets Salvatore off the hook; it is Alfredo who  demands that his protege leave town and never look back, as if absolving Toto  for his selfishness.  </P> <P> There's a tricky balance here. But Noiret -- a consummate craftsman even, as  here, when he's being dubbed into Italian -- keeps Alfredo real and earthy, a  lugubrious-looking bear who turns preternatural wizard in the booth. Salvatore  may become a cinema aristocrat, but this illiterate old peasant has a tactile  love affair with the movies, the takeup reels, the gigantic single projector  that pours its blaze of light through an aperture formed into the shape of a  roaring lion.  </P> <P> Beneath Alfredo is an entire community that Tornatore lovingly re-creates.  While Alfredo shows movies like Renoir's social-realist classic "The Lower  Depths" or Visconti's Sicilian epic "Le Terra Trema," the audience divides up  into classes too. Up in the balcony is a bespectacled snob who spits on the  rabble below. Underneath is a hurly-burly of working men and women,  prostitutes, local families and small children like Toto.  </P> <P> Tornatore catches this rowdy crowd in a spirit of satire, but he also fills the  movie with odd, reverent imagery. Sex and religion, mysticism and sensuality,  are the twin poles of "Paradiso." For every film homage, for every clip of  Errol Flynn smooching or Vittorio De Sica gambling or Brigitte Bardot  lusciously in the nude, there's often a religious symbol: the local priest who  rings his bell at obscenities; the plaster Madonna flaming up along with the  burning stills of Bogart or Buster Keaton. Toto is altar boy as well as  Alfredo's assistant; he crosses himself when he enters the projection booth.  When the new Cinema Paradiso opens, priests bless it and then recoil from the  "pornographic" sight of a torrid Silvana Mangano mambo. And when now-blind  Alfredo makes his first visit there he asks, almost plaintively, "Any room for  me in the new paradise?"  </P> <P> Is there any room? "Cinema Paradiso" (Times-rated Family despite language and  lovemaking) is not just about the relationship or tragedy of Toto and Alfredo.  It's about the loss of a whole culture, a whole era -- a time when audiences  gathered in intimate communion in their favorite movie houses, when movies and  distribution weren't calculated, homogenized and marketing-hooked to death, and  when the people who showed and watched them loved them madly.  </P> <P> It may seem absurd or oversentimental to keep linking up films with objects of  worship and love affairs as Tornatore does here, but it reflects how people  really felt, how many of us feel now.  </P> <P> And when Salvatore the movie aristocrat watches, in a modern screening room,  the last gift bequeathed to him by his old friend, the peasant-worker of  "Cinema Paradiso," it's a moment of epiphany that goes beyond sentimentality.  It's a flood of passion, a collage of tenderness. It suggests the moment when  cinema, released in the dark, almost becomes paradise.  </P> <P> 'CINEMA PARADISO'  </P> <P> A Miramax Films release.

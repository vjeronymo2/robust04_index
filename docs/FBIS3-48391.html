The issue will be put to international agenda next month  when  the IAEA holds board of governors meeting, she said.    The IAEA wants to conduct specific tests to verify that  North  Korea did not divert any nuclear material since the last  inspection and to allow future verification while ensuring  continuity in safeguards, Shelly told a noon briefing.    "North Korea, while agreeing with a number of the planned  measures, indicated that a significant number of other required  measures, ones that were outlined by the IAEA, would not be  allowed," she explained.    "The IAEA will not send an inspection team to North Korea  unless there is full agreement on the safeguard measures which  have been specified and have been judged necessary for a  meaningful inspection," said Shelly.    While predicting a "formal review on this" at the February  board meeting, the spokeswoman emphasized the complexity of the  situation.    The United States or the security council will call a halt  when "they feel that there is nothing meaningful" in ongoing  talks.    "This is not a simple issue," she said.    But Washington is hopeful still of a settlement, according  to  Shelly, "I think the fact that North Korea is in Vienna and is  trying to work out the details with the IAEA is an indication  that they are committed to finding a resolution to the problem."    There was no planned contact with North Korea in New York,  she added.</p>

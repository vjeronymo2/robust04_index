			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Finance &amp; The Family: Retail sales show sharp monthly rise Retail sales raced upwards in March, according to government figures. This might have been the first sign of the end of the recession, but many analysts thought that it just showed that people were buying early to avoid the rise in VAT at the end of the month. Last month total sales volume rose by 3.7 per cent, according to provisional estimates. This is the biggest monthly rise since June 1979  - the last time VAT was increased - when sales increased by 6.9 per cent.</p>

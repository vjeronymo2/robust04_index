			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["for"-signed report: "Labor Minister Opposed to Early </F> Retirement"]    [Text] Bonn -- Labor Minister Norbert Bluem (Christian  Democratic Union) has defended the G-7 Jobs Conference in  Detroit. The meeting of labor, finance, and economics ministers  of the seven major industrial nations has clearly improved  conditions for harmonizing labor market initiatives. In view of  the practices adopted by multinational trusts, control of the  labor market and of job developments can no longer be an  exclusively national task.    The German Trade Union Federation had accused the government  of taking a defendant's position in Detroit. The Federal  Republic was the only participant that did not create a new  stimulus for economic recovery, and it was criticized for this.  Speaking to correspondents, Bluem said that the Detroit talks  had determined fields of action that would not have become  visible without this joint initiative. Against the background  of big trusts' international employment policies labor policy  needs find new solutions. The labor market, which has become  disordered, can no longer be controlled by individual national  initiatives alone.  <H5>  New Qualifications </H5>   The Federal Republic does quite well in international labor  market comparisons. Germany continues to come out on top as far  as vocational qualifications are concerned. In addition,  Germany is the only country besides Japan where unemployment  among young people is below the average unemployment rate. This  development is a success of the dual system of vocational  training, Bluem said. Qualifications are also the key factor for  a successful implementation of labor market initiatives.    With the existing labor market situation, original training  is no longer the most important thing, but new qualifications  must be acquired, the minister said. Employees have good  opportunities if "they keep abreast with new developments in  their jobs."    Referring to Finance Minister Theo Waigel (Christian Social  Union), who said in Detroit that certain inflexibilities still  have to be overcome in Germany following reunification, the  minister called upon companies and trade unions to give up their  inflexible positions with regard to working hours and to find  new and creative solutions and models. There are no legal  obstacles preventing this. It is high time to agree on  "tailor-made individual working hours."    On a critical note, Bluem said that the entire transport  infrastructure accounts for German industry and administration  structures that hardly allow for any variations in working  hours, with work beginning early in the morning. In Germany,  everything is organized by the "march in review" principle. The  Federal Republic would have an additional 2 million people  working if it adopted the part-time regulations common in The  Netherlands.    Another unresolved problem is the employment of older  people,  Bluem said. There are cultural and social reasons clearly  speaking against early retirement of older people, but they  should be offered flexible opportunities for employment instead.  The policy adopted by many companies that laid off older people  turned out to be a mistake. The recent development with entire  sectors, such as steel or mining, hardly having any workers that  are older than 50 "must be counteracted."  <H5>  "Vigorous Statements" </H5>   This has also been proven by several analyses that U.S.  Secretary of Labor Robert Reich presented in Detroit. The  minister said self-critically that "earlier vigorous Bluem  statements," with which he had spoken out for many people making  use of the early retirement scheme, are no longer up to date.</p>

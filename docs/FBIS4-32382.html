			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, June 21 (CTK) -- Wage growth limits in  1994 will be 10 percent for loss-making companies and 12 percent  for profit-making companies, according to a resolution approved  by the Slovak Government today.    During the first quarter, wages in loss-earning companies in  Slovakia grew by 15.1 percent in comparison with the first  quarter in 1993. As many as 2,900 firms with 25 or more  employees had combined losses of ten billion crowns in the first  quarter.    By holding down wages in profit-making firms the government  is attempting to prevent wage increases in the financial,  banking and insurance sphere.</p>

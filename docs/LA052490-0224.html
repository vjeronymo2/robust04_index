			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE BUTCHER: SAVE MONEY WITH ITALIAN-STYLE CUTS  </P> <P> If you want to eat better for less, maybe you should learn to be Italian. It's  not all that hard. My children gave me a little book that teaches you almost  everything you need to know. It's called "How to be Italian" by Lou D'Angelo  and it gives you all kinds of helpful hints:  </P> <P>  -- "Italian power is something that comes from deep inside, like a rumbling in  the stomach. Ditto Italian sex appeal."  </P> <P>  -- "Choose yourself a genuine Italian name. Once you've established yourself,  you can always change it back."  </P> <P> OK, I'm not serious. You can't really learn to be Italian, but you can learn to  think like an Italian butcher, and that will save you money.  </P> <P> Italians were among the first to do business as retail butchers in what is now  my part of the world -- Northern California. They did things and do things  differently than back in Iowa, where I learned the trade from English and  German butchers. Back there, back then, beef was cut with the bones left in.  Steaks like T-bones and sirloins had bones in them. Prime rib roasts had ribs  in them. Pot roasts were named for the bone they contained: blade chuck,  7-bone.  </P> <P> It has long been a tradition with Italian butchers to "muscle bone" beef. The  meat is cut along the natural seams separating each muscle one from the other,  leaving the bones behind. It took me a while to learn the muscle boning method  of breaking beef, but it was a lesson worth learning.  </P> <P> Perhaps the best example of this -- one that can save money on the meat bill if  you do a little cutting up in the kitchen -- is the beef chuck.  </P> <P> The chuck is the shoulder of the beef animal. It's a large part of the carcass  (about 26%), and it contains several different muscles -- some tough, some  tender. English and German butchers cut the chuck into pot roasts primarily,  either blade cut or arm cut, to compensate for the tough muscles that required  long, slow, moist cooking. Cut Italian style, the individual muscles of the  chuck are separated so that each can be cooked according to its natural degree  of tenderness.  </P> <P> Cutting beef Italian style is not as complicated today as it was when I was  learning the trade. Most of the beef that comes to market these days has  already had all of the bones removed at the packer. All that remains to be done  is the separation of the individual muscles.  </P> <P> Most beef chucks come to market divided into two boneless sub-primal cuts: The  cross-rib chuck or shoulder clod and the under-blade chuck. The shoulder clod  is a solid muscle removed from the arm portion of the chuck. Because it is a  solid muscle, it is easy to carve across the grain into thin slices, either  before or after cooking. It makes a good roast for the oven or barbecue if you  roast it slow (300 to 325 degrees) and keep it from getting too well done.  </P> <P> Thin slices from the clod are perfect for stuffing to make beef rolls Italian  style, any style.  </P> <P> A couple of thicker slices of clod can be turned into a boneless chuck roast  Italian style. Simply slice off a piece of the clod one-inch thick and then a  second slice two-inches thick. Butterfly the second slice by cutting it almost  in half, but not quite, so that you can fold it open, making a piece the same  thickness as the first, but twice as big around.  </P> <P> Cover the smaller slice with a layer of thinly sliced pepperoni or Italian dry  salami, one (2 1/4-ounce) can sliced black olives and one-quarter pound thinly  sliced mozzarella cheese. Place the butterflied slice on top and tie with  string at about one-inch intervals in both directions. Roast as described  above, or braise; brown well on both sides in a bit of olive oil, add a cup of  red wine, cover and simmer for about an hour.  </P> <P> The sub-primal under-blade chuck is the cut that offers the most money-saving  potential for the would-be Italian cut-up. It's the one you are most apt to  find on special, or at least reasonably priced, in the pot roast section of the  meat case, labeled, most probably, beef chuck pot roast-boneless. When you see  it, preferably on special, take home a piece, a good sized piece, and pretend  you're Italian. Take it apart.  </P> <P> Separate the individual muscles along the natural seams. Save the seam fat and  connective tissue from between the muscles to make a rich stock for making  sauces and soups.  </P> <P> After you have all of the muscles of the chuck separated and trimmed of all  gristle and fat, take a moment to examine each carefully. Some, you will note,  will have a coarse grainy texture. These are going to be tough and need moist  heat cooking to tenderize them. Use them for braised dishes or stews. Some  muscles will have a texture velvety smooth and fine. These can be used for all  kinds of quick or fry dishes, Italian and otherwise. Slice them into thin  strips for stir-fry, stroganoff, or Indonesian sate; or cut them in cubes for  fondue. Use your imagination.  </P> <P> You will, almost certainly, be seeing Italian Style cuts cropping up in the  butcher's meat case. It's good merchandising. They can make more money. But you  can do it yourself. You don't have to be Italian.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Yasir 'Arafat is to arrive on the 12th of next  month for a three-day visit to Jericho and Gaza. A message to  this effect has been relayed by 'Arafat's advisers to the  Israeli Government. Our correspondent notes that 'Arafat  postponed his visit by one week due to Israel's demand that he  give at least two weeks advance notice of his arrival.    According to Palestinian sources, Israel is not allowing  'Arafat to visit East Jerusalem and the Temple Mount. During  his visit in Jericho 'Arafat will meet U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher, who is scheduled to return to our region.</p>

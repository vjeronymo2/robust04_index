			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / International Company News: Klockner-Werke in talks on plant sale KLOCKNER-WERKE, the diversified German steel group, is in talks with three international groups to sell a majority stake in its steel plant in Bremen. The company said yesterday in was holding 'intensive discussions' to sell its integrated steel plant, which employs 4,600 in the city state of Bremen and has an annual crude steel capacity of 3m tonnes. The potential bidders are a consortium co-ordinated by the Bremen state government, grouping local companies and Sidmar, a subsidiary of the Arbed steelmaker of Luxembourg; Thyssen and Krupp-Hoesch, Germany's two largest steelmakers, which have held talks with Usinor-Sacilor of France about linking for a bid; and Hoogovens, the Dutch steel producer. These talks lend weight to the belief that Mr Hans Chritoph von Rohr, the chairman of Klockner-Werke, intends to sell the steel activities. The company narrowly escaped bankruptcy earlier this year due to a debt relief scheme which allowed it to write off nearly half its DM2.7bn (Dollars 1.7bn) debt. The group's steel activities recorded a DM200m loss in the year ended September 30, 1992. Following the debt relief scheme, Klockner-Werke sold its special steel subsidiary for a symbolic DM2 to Mr Jurgen Grossmann, its chairman, and Druker, a Frankfurt-based consultancy company acquiring 25 per cent of the shares. Thyssen reiterated yesterday that it was only interested in buying the cold-rolling mill and not other parts of the Bremen steel mill, which produces flat steel products. But a Klockner-Werke spokesman said that the company 'was only interested in selling a majority stake'. The Bremen government recently moved to block the Thyssen offer because of fears that the German steel group would close down most of the mill and eliminate a competitor in the German steel market. 'We are convinced that the plant is competitive and should survive,' Mr Claus Jager, Bremen economics minister, said. The consortium is believed to include companies in Bremen whose survival depends on the activities of the Klockner steel plant. These include the Bremen Vulcan shipyards, already receiving state subsidies. They also include the city's electricity utility for which the steel plant is a major client and which is slated for privatisation.</p>

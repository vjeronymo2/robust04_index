			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, May 3 (AFP) -- France Tuesday [3 May] said it  is granting strife-torn Rwanda three million francs [Fr]  ($540,000) in emergency aid.    Cooperation Minister Michel Roussin told the National  Assembly that the government had yet to decide on the best way  to channel the money.    France, he said, "has not stood by passively in the face of  this drama, and will continue to show its solidarity."</p>

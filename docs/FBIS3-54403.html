			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By a JORDAN TIMES staff reporter] </F>   [Text] Amman--Transport Minister Adib Halasah headed for  Baghdad Monday for high-level talks with Iraqi officials on  issues related to the flow of Iraq-bound cargo through Jordan  and the operations of a joint transport company.    Mr. Halasah and his Iraqi counterpart Ahmad Murtada would  cochair the annual board meeting of the Iraqi-Jordanian Land  Transport Company (IJTLC) and review the company's 1993  operations and draw up plans for the next year.    The meeting will also finalise the 1993 report and annual  accounts of the company, owned by the Jordanian and Iraqi  governments, officials said. No details of the company's  financial status were immediately available.    However, the officials said, the company's operations have  been adversely affected by the continuing international  sanctions against Iraq. Before the sanctions were imposed in  August 1990, following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, the company  largely depended on transporting Iraq-bound cargo unloaded at  al-'Aqabah to Iraq.    The company continued to survive after the imposition of the  sanctions on Iraqi imports of food and medicine exempt from the  sanctions, but the overall volume of such cargo has decreased  gradually, with Iraqi government agencies as well as private  sector merchants turning to Iranian, Lebanese and Turkish ports  for their imports to avert the costly delays incurred while  importing through al-'Aqabah.    The delays and higher freight charges are caused as a result  of what importers describe as overzealous enforcement of the  sanctions by inspectors aboard warships patrolling the Red Sea.    During his talks in Baghdad, Mr. Halasah, who is accompanied  by the Jordanian board members of the IJLTC and senior company  officials, is also expected to raise Jordan's concerns over  further decline of Iraqi imports through al-'Aqabah following  the reopening of Iraq's Gulf port of Umm Qasr in November, the  officials said.    While on a visit to Amman in late November, a senior Iraqi  transport ministry official was reported to have assured Jordan  that there was "a political decision" not to let the reopening  of Umm Qasr affect Iraq's imports through al-'Aqabah.    But a campaign launched in Baghdad to encourage private  sector importers to use Umm Qasr through incentives such as free  fuel and bunkering, and guidelines given to shippers to use  small-size vessels suitable to the Gulf port's capabilities have  fuelled Jordanian concrns.    In one case, the Australian Wheat Board was requested to use  two 25,000-tonne ships to carry 50,000 tonnes of wheat to Iraq  instead of one 50,000-tonne vessel. Umm Qasr can only handle  vessels up to a 25,000-tonne capacity.    Jordanian shipping agents however, expect a minimum level of  Iraq-bound cargo to pass through al-'Aqabah.    "Umm Qasr is suitable for Iraqi imports from the Far East,"  said a shipping agent. "But volume of Iraqi purchase from the  Far East is not much anyway. The bulk of Iraqi imports is from  Europe, and this has to come through al-'Aqabah."    Furthermore, said the agent, many shipowners are reluctant  to  send their vessels to Umm Qasr because most international  insurance companies either refuse to extend coverage to the  vessel or demand high premiums.    Umm Qasr lies in an area where the threat of mines planted  during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war as well as the war over Kuwait  remains high.    The Jordanian Shipping Agents Association (JSAA) has called  on the government to cooperate with the shipping sector to  devise a package of incentives to attract shipping lines to use  al-'Aqabah.</p>

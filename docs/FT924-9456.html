			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Fresh threat for north-east pit BRITISH COAL has linked the survival chances of the only deep-coal colliery in north-east England not on British Coal's recent 31-pit closure list to an application for opencast coal extraction. Ellington Colliery - or Big E - on the Northumberland coast near Ashington, provides 1,600 mining jobs and sustains hundreds more by supplying coal to the nearby Alcan aluminium smelter and Blyth power station. The licence under which the pit tips 670,000 tonnes a year of unsightly colliery waste on adjacent Lynemouth beach was renewed in 1990 on condition that British Coal pursued other means of disposal before the licence expires in mid 1995. It was warned that the licence would not be renewed unless the planning system showed that no land-based alternative existed. British Coal has told Northumberland County Council and local MPs that it will submit a planning application next year seeking permission to dispose of the waste on land next to the pit - and to mine 1.75m tonnes of coal opencast over six years. 'Without a shadow of doubt it will be an extremely contentious application,' said Mr Kevin Flaherty, the council's planning committee chairman, yesterday. 'We do feel caught in the middle; there's a great deal of pressure from both sides.' British Coal says the proposal is 'absolutely crucial' for the pit's future. Opencasting, it said, would create space for the waste. The site would avoid environmentally unacceptable waste transported by road, avoiding extra costs that would increase production overheads. Northumberland County Council has protested that opencasting in the county, providing 15 per cent of the UK's opencast coal, has reached unacceptable levels. The North East Opencast Action Group will oppose the application, said Mr Andrew Pratt, the organisation's chairman. 'We think it's trying to hold a gun to the county council's head,' he added. Mr Jack Thompson, the National Union of Mineworkers-sponsored Labour MP for adjacent Wansbeck, where most Ellington miners live, said he hoped the council would oppose the plan. He added: 'It smells a little bit of blackmail.'</p>

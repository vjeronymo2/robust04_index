			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> TAYLOR'S STATISTICS ARE DOWN, BUT HE IS STILL A GIANT FORCE  </P> <P> Pro football's Superman has spent some time playing Clark Kent lately.  </P> <P> When New York Giants linebacker Lawrence Taylor collected three sacks and  forced a fumble in the season opener against the Philadelphia Eagles, despite  skipping training camp while holding out, it enhanced the Superman reputation  of the nine-time Pro Bowler.  </P> <P> Since then, though, Taylor has looked, at times, like a 31-year-old linebacker.  He's had a total of just 1 1/2 sacks the past five games and none in the past  three.  </P> <P> When he lines up against the Washington Redskins on Sunday, he'll be trying to  end a drought of two games without a sack against a team he once terrorized.  </P> <P> Giants Coach Bill Parcells said: "It's different when you're 31 than it is when  you're 21. It takes him a little while longer to recover from games than it  used to, and he has to deal with that, too."  </P> <P> It's also tougher on Taylor now that the team's other outside linebacker, Carl  Banks, is on injured reserve with a damaged wrist. Opposing teams can run away  from Taylor more effectively.  </P> <P> Taylor says skipping training camp has taken its toll. It took time for him to  get in shape, and he was set back when he pulled a hamstring against the Miami  Dolphins on Sept. 23.  </P> <P> "Usually in the fourth quarter, when everyone else is tired, I can step it up  and make some plays. That hasn't happened this year," he said.  </P> <P> Taylor, though, still commands respect.  </P> <P> Redskins Coach Joe Gibbs seemed to get upset when it was suggested two weeks  ago that the Redskins showed last year they could stop Taylor. The game two  weeks ago hasn't changed Gibbs' mind.  </P> <P> According to the coach, Taylor changes the Redskins' playbook.  </P> <P> "If you want to add up everything he does to you, it starts with the things you  can't do right off the bat. You don't run certain plays against him. It's hard  to run a lot of your favorite things. You have to change your style of  offense," Gibbs said.  </P> <P> The Redskins often double-team Taylor with tackle Jim Lachey and tight end Don  Warren and occasionally get wide receiver Ricky Sanders in his way.  </P> <P> Parcells said: "Several teams have decided he's not going to ruin their game.  Teams have decided to do something about him and guys like Reggie White (of the  Eagles)."  </P> <P> Taylor, who says he'll retire when his contract expires after the 1992 season,  points to the double-teaming as a sign that he's still a force.  </P> <P> "When they start blocking me with a single person and not worrying where I'm at  or what I'm doing, that's when I know I'm just another ballplayer," he said.  </P> <P> Taylor doesn't appear concerned about his age.  </P> <P> "Three weeks ago, I was the greatest thing since white bread. All of a sudden  now, 'Oh, he's too old.' I don't think you're going to find a whole lot of  people saying, 'He's ready for the junkyard.' That's quite evident by what  teams are doing," he said.  </P> <P> Giants General Manager George Young says Taylor's only problem is living up to  his reputation.  </P> <P> "The trouble with great players, like great coaches, is that they're fighting  their own legend every week," Young said.  </P></p>

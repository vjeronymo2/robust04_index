Baker,  Canadian assistant deputy minister of fisheries, has written to  Chinese Ambassador to Canada Zhang Yijun making clear the  Canadian Government stand on the export of seal products to  China.    Recently, an international animal rights organization  accused  China's Shanghai Fisheries General Corporation of violating the  Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild  Fauna and Flora (CITES) by importing 50,000 dead seals from  Canada's Newfoundland and Labrador Province to make aphrodisiacs  out of sex organs severed from male seals.    Some Western countries' newspapers gave this accusation a  lot  of coverage. Some congressmen of a certain country even  proposed a bill to attack China on the issue.    Baker said in the letter: "I am writing to express the  support of the Government of Canada, and to seek the support of  your government for the joint venture between Terra Nova Fishery  Co. Ltd. (TNF) and the Shanghai Fisheries General Corporation  (SFGC) to produce seal products for export to China. The  government of the province of Newfoundland and Labrador also  strongly supports the project.    "We share the concern of your government regarding the  unfounded allegations that seals will harvested for the sole  purpose of using the male sex organs to make sexual stimulants.    "It has been common practice for the more extreme groups  (campaigning against seal hunting) to make sensational  allegations to stir up controversy and attract media attention."    The letter pointed out that the proposed venture is fully  consistent with Canada's commitment to the conservation and  rational management of marine resources based on the principle  of sustainable development.    There is a long-established commercial seal hunt in Canada  which is closely regulated, the letter said.    Canada encourages full use of harvested seals and would  oppose any project to kill seals only for a small part of the  animal, the letter went on.    The joint venture involves the harvesting and use of the  whole seal, the letter noted. It conforms to the licensing  requirements and regulations of the Governments of Canada and  the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador. Equally, it is fully  in accord with international conservation requirements.    Baker emphasized that the harp seal is not regulated by the  convention because it is not endangered or threatened, and  therefore no CITES permit would be required for export of harp  seal products from Canada.    At the end of the letter, Baker said he hoped that the  Chinese Government would consider this project favorably and  approve the joint venture.</p>

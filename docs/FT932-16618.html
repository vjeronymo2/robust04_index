			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / Arts: Bashmet - a great violist / Recital Over any few years, there is scarcely ever more than one viola player who can fill international concert halls. These days he is Yuri Bashmet, who (all but) filled the Barbican Hall on Thursday - and with a programme of stern sobriety. That was a feat. In fact Schubert's 'Arpeggione' Sonata, with which he began, is not normally expected to be so sober; but Bashmet expounded it with all his customary poise and intensity as if there were no joker anywhere in the pack. There is room for a contrary opinion: that when Schubert fulfilled his commission for the arpeggione (a species of bass viol, now extinct) he traded both upon its comical capacity for jumping between registers - which Bashmet's viola did with cool grace - and on its natural bent toward popular jollity, in the second subject of the Allegro moderato and most of the Finale. In those places there was no trace of a smile from Bashmet. Yet he expanded beautifully into the little Adagio, which can rarely have struck such depths of feeling. In place of the advertised Schnittke, we got a one-movement sonata by Nikolai Roslavets (1881-1944), a Russian avant-gardiste who sank beneath Stalinist disfavour. Some stretches of pure, late Skryabin, tritone-laden chords and all; a 'rondo' form, in the same stretched sense that applies to Skryabin's last piano sonatas, with similar extremes of clattery frenzy and sudden, hushed intimations. Bar by bar, however, Roslavets's diction shares only a couple of tropes with Skryabin's; there is more formally controlled argument, and more than a whiff of practice-constrained-by-theory (he wrote treatises on advanced chord progressions). At the piano, whose role is at least as important as the viola's, Mikhail Muntian was fluent and clangorous as required. Throughout that first half of the recital the audience was respectfully attentive, but not (I thought) much moved. In the circumstances the second half, allotted wholly to Shostakovich's last work, his op. 147 Viola Sonata, made a dour prospect: long, relentless, mostly slow, alternately grief-stricken and numb, with brief bursts of livid fury. The writing is cruelly spare, often reduced to sullen strings of single notes. Very few works of any composer are at once so expressively, nakedly personal and so disconsolate. In this bleak territory, Bashmet is unequalled - and the veteran Muntian partnered Fyodor Druzkinin, Bashmet's teacher, in the first (posthumous) performance of the sonata in 1975. Their basilisk concentration compelled us to listen, forbade critical detachment: the lean lines, subtly plain and earth-coloured, spoke volumes. Since we live in fluey-cold times, several people in the Barbican audience were at the point of choking on coughs and sneezes during the Aria and Scherzo, but the entire hall held its breath for the agonised final Adagio. It was a discomforting experience - scathing, even; but indelible.</p>

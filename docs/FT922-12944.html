			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Midland fined Pounds 50,000 for Dumenil failure MIDLAND Bank, which acts as one of the largest trustees in the UK for unit trust investment schemes, was fined Pounds 50,000 yesterday for failing to prevent circumstances which led to the closure of the Dumenil unit trust group two years ago. Administrative mistakes at Dumenil caused the price of units in its 11 unit trusts, which covered various European markets, to be wrongly calculated. The trusts, which at one time managed Pounds 86m for 25,000 private investors, were subsequently wound up and investors paid out in full. Midland, which with Coutts, a subsidiary of National Westminster, acted as trustee to the Dumenil funds, had been responsible for ensuring the managers of the trusts carried out their duties properly. It has admitted three failures in its supervision of the Dumenil fund managers, according to a statement yesterday by the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation, one of the City's self-regulatory organisations. The bank has been ordered to pay the fine and Imro's investigation costs, thought to amount to nearly Pounds 200,000. Midland is one of the UK's top three trustees, being responsible for funds under management of about Pounds 6bn, about an eighth of the UK market. The failures to which Midland admitted are: It did not take reasonable care to ensure the managers calculated unit prices properly. Its supervision of the schemes was not close enough to prevent the managers breaching investment rules which limit the proportion of a trust's funds that can be placed in any particular investment. It failed to ensure a proper register was kept of the holders of six unit trusts. Midland yesterday called the failures 'technical rule breaches of an administrative nature', and said it had acted to ensure its systems were fully in compliance with Imro rules. Coutts' role in the Dumenil collapse is thought still to be under investigation.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] On the morning of 16 May, the Hubei provincial  economic delegation held a news briefing in Europe's triangle  region -- Germany's Saarland, France's Lorraine, and the city of  Saarlouis in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg --and, at the same  time, a seminar in the city of Ludwigsburg in the Ruhr Valley  industrial area, which is situated in west-central Germany.  Over 200 entrepreneurs and bankers were invited to attend the  two gatherings to hear about Hubei's economic and technological  cooperation projects.    In the city of Saarlouis, while systematically expounding on  the various methods taken to absorb foreign capital, Comrade  Guan Guangfu said: China's reform and opening up to the outside  world is irreversible, like the earth revolving round the sun,  and its determination to link its economy with the world economy  is unshakable. China's economy is moving into the orbit of  sustained, steady, and healthy growth. China is both the  world's largest construction site and market. Although Hubei is  not the largest province in China, it is one of the provinces  with the greatest potential for development. Those who are the  first to go and invest in China and Hubei will be the first to  reap benefits.    After the news briefing, which was held in the city of  Saarlouis, Guan Guangfu and other comrades attended the signing  ceremony for the $80-million agreements concluded by our  province with three German companies and one French company.    In the city of Ludwigsburg, Wuhan Vice Mayor (Wu Houfu)  briefed seminar participants on Wuhan City's investment  environment and development plan and reviewed the close ties  between Wuhan and Ludwigsburg. Stressing the role of Wuhan, one  of the exceptionally big cities in China, as a dragon head in  the Chang Jiang Economic Belt and Hubei Province, he said:  Wuhan City is the center of China's inland market. Our  delegation brings along close to 200 economic and technological  cooperation projects requiring a total investment of  approximately $1.5 billion. After the seminar, German bankers  and entrepreneurs held discussions with the Wuhan delegation on  the specific ways of cooperation and signed 19 letters of intent  involving a total investment of about $200 million.</p>

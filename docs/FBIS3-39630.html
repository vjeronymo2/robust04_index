This is shown by  the latest estimates from the EU Commission.    This means that Finland will receive more from the EU budget  than it pays in.    According to the Commission's estimates, Finland's net  contribution will amount to around ECU100 million, corresponding  to something over 600 million markkas.    This is due to the seriously weakened Finnish economy and  the  large payments that are expected to be paid back to Finland for  agriculture and regional policy support.    But a spokesman for the Commission stressed that this figure  should be taken with a pinch of salt. As long as membership  negotiations have not settled the chapters on agriculture and  regional support, the calculations are unreliable.    The other three countries -- Sweden, Austria, and Norway --  will be net contributors in the event of membership -- that is,  they will pay more into the EU budget than they will receive in  return in payments from the EU's various funds. And Sweden will  be the biggest net contributor, with probably the highest  membership fee per inhabitant.</p>

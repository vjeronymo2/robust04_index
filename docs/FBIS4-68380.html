			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Announcement by the St. Petersburg State Newspaper Complex: </F> "Newspaper Publication Suspended"]    [Text] The St. Petersburg State Newspaper Complex wishes to  make it known that a number of central and local newspapers  systematically fail to fulfill contract agreements with respect  to payments for printing services.    As of 20 April 1994, the newspaper complex was owed R10.6  million by ARGUMENTY I FAKTY, R35.6 million by ROSSIYSKIYE  VESTI, R26.5 million by ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA, and R13.9 by SMENA.    The total amount owed to the complex by all customers  amounted to more than R300 million.    Because of systematic nonpayments the printing house is  unable to purchase materials and pay for fuel, energy, and  transportation, which may jeopardize newspaper printing in St.  Petersburg and the Northwestern region altogether.    Beginning 25 April 1994, the printing house is compelled to  suspend printing the following newspaper until all payments due  are received: ARGUMENTY I FAKTY, ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI, and  ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA.    We suggest that all complaints be addressed to these  newspapers' editors.</p>

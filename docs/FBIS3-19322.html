With an increase of 10.6 percent to 41.609 billion  schillings, imports rose far more strongly than exports, which  went up by only 3.1 percent to 34.539 billion. However, the  month under review had one work day more than January 1993.    Higher imports are registered primarily from the FRG (up 6.7  percent), Italy (up 16.8 percent), France (up 14.3 percent), the  Netherlands (up 16.2 percent), Sweden (up 23.2 percent), and the  United States (up 28.8 percent). Imports from the Czech  Republic (up 41.5 percent) and Russia (up 27.9 percent) have  also gone up. An increase was registered in Austrian exports to  France (14 percent), Spain (29 percent), Slovenia (10.8  percent), Hungary (20 percent), the United States (35.8  percent), and Switzerland (11 percent).    In January imports decreased only for fuels and energy (down  2.1 percent), while all other important groups of goods  experienced increases, in some cases even double-digit growth  rates. In exports there were losses concerning processed goods  (down 1.2 percent) and durable consumer goods (down 3.3 percent;  clothes, furniture, musical instruments). Exports of raw  materials (16.4 percent) and chemical products (12.3 percent)  showed an increase.</p>

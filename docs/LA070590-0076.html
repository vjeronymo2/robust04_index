			<p><P> July 5, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN;  </P> <P> COUNCIL SAYS CENTER CAN'T HOUSE CHURCH  </P> <P> It seemed a perfect match: a commercial center with few tenants paired with a  church with no home.  </P> <P> But when the Tustin Redevelopment Agency committed $250,000 to improvements for  the Pacific CommerCenter on Red Hill Avenue in 1986, the money came with an  agreement that specified acceptable uses. Housing churches was not one of them.  </P> <P> By a 3-2 vote, the City Council rejected the owner's request to modify the  agreement to allow the church to make the center its temporary home.  </P> <P> "I am sympathetic to the church and the concept of the church being in the  city, but when we have a legal opinion given to us and when we have spent  hundreds of thousands on the development, I cannot support this modification,"  Mayor Richard B. Edgar said.  </P> <P> City Atty. James G. Rourke said in a written opinion that giving the developer  money and then not requiring him to conform to the agreement's obligations  would "smack of a gift of public funds."  </P> <P> "Clearly, the redevelopment plan does not provide for churches in the project  area, and the basic purpose and intent of a redevelopment project is to  generate tax increment revenue, which a church does not produce," Rourke wrote,  stating that substantial legal findings would be required under state law to  modify the agreement.  </P> <P> Councilmen Jim Potts and Earl J. Prescott disagreed with the majority opinion.  </P> <P> "Under the (redevelopment agreement), an atomic-bomb manufacturer could be  there, but not a church," Prescott said. "It's a matter of this council's  desire."  </P> <P> James Biram of the center's property manager, Newport Beach-based Resco, said  he was frustrated by the council's decision. Since the agreement was  negotiated, the business climate has changed, he said. While lease rates were  projected at $1.05 per square foot, the 62,000-square-foot center is now  leasing for 79 cents a square foot, he said. Even at that price, the vacancy  rate is about 45%, he said.  </P> <P> Randy Wolf, pastor of Harvest Fellowship International, was also disappointed.  Unable to find a home in the city, his church now meets at Saddleback Inn in  Santa Ana. SHANNON SANDS  </P></p>

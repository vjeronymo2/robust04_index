			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mirza Saikovic] </F>   [Excerpts] The Serbian aggressor is continuing his  offensive on the Bihac region on this 57th day of fighting in  this part of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Karadzic's terrorists last  night continued artillery attacks on Bihac and the surrounding  area. Civilians in this UN protected zone are still being  targeted. [passage omitted]    The lines of separation with the paramilitary formations of  the so-called Cazin autonomous region were not quiet either. The  separatists are constantly opening small-arms fire and provoking  clashes. They are still shelling the (?Prusce) area in the Cazin  municipality.</p>

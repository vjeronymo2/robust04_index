			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Czechs warn Germany on tighter asylum laws GERMANY'S plan to curb the influx of asylum-seekers, approved in the Bundestag on Wednesday, could be hampered by Czech unwillingness to take back deportees. Mr Josef Zileniec, the Czech foreign affairs minister, said yesterday Germany should understand it could not solve its domestic security issues at the cost of the Czech republic. Most asylum-seekers from the former Yugoslavia, Romania and Bulgaria cross the former Czechoslovak territory on their way to Germany. Czech officials have indicated they want certain assurances before agreeing to allow back such asylum-seekers barred by Germany. 'We first need assurances that countries such as Romania and Bulgaria will take them back,' a Czech official said. 'We also need a proper border with Slovakia. This could take two years to be set up.' German conservative MPs have welcomed a deportation agreement signed three weeks ago with Poland. Under the agreement, Poland will take back 10,000 asylum-seekers this year and an unlimited number thereafter. Germany is offering DM120m (Pounds 47.8m) to build the infrastructure to host the asylum-seekers. The agreement with Poland was crucial to winning over the opposition Social Democrats, who for a long time opposed changing Germany's constitution to dilute its guarantee of political asylum to foreigners. In future, border guards will be able to stop asylum-seekers 'with manifestedly unfounded' claims, turning them back to 'safe' countries. But it is feared more foreigners will try to enter Germany illegally. Surveillance on Germany's eastern borders will be stepped up, with 1,700 more police taking up duty later this summer. Officials are also testing infra-red equipment that will allow border trespassers to be seen at night.</p>

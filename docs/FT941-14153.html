			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / Spring Ram launches Pounds 42m rights Shares in Spring Ram rose 9p to 76p after the new management of the UK kitchens and bathrooms group announced a Pounds 42.2m rights issue to take advantage of trading opportunities. The group also said that pre-tax losses for the year to January 1 would not exceed Pounds 36.5m. Proceeds of the 2-for-9 issue, priced at 53p, will eliminate Pounds 33m debt. The deterioration in Spring Ram's balance sheet was one of the main reasons for disgruntled institutional shareholders installing Mr Roger Regan as chairman last summer. In September he forced the resignation of Mr Bill Rooney, co-founder and chief executive of the Yorkshire company. After accounting changes, Spring Ram's losses were Pounds 34.6m for the six months to July 31. Mr Regan said sales had grown in the second half of 1993 and he believed economic activity was increasing in the group's markets. It was essential it had working capital available to seize these opportunities. The proceeds would also finance organic growth and bolt-on acquisitions in the Pounds 5m-Pounds 10m range. 'Spring Ram has been through a difficult period in its history, during which the group, its businesses, its management and its finances have all come under intense scrutiny. Throughout this period, the principal businesses have continued to demonstrate their strengths,' Mr Regan said. 'I believe that it is important for investors, management and employees alike to be able to draw a line under the events of the recent past and to focus on the future.' The pre-tax loss was mainly caused by the Pounds 30.2m provision announced at the time of interim results. Mr Martin Towers, finance director, said there would be no need for further provisions. Group sales increased from Pounds 193.3m to Pounds 240m, but underlying growth was about 10 per cent, excluding property development and Pounds 25m of sales from Stag Furniture, bought at the end of 1992. Mr Regan described as 'an appalling inheritance' the Regency Doors business in the special products division, where operating losses increased from Pounds 2.9m to Pounds 11.3m. He said a new management team was now developing the recently created business 'which lacked adequate operating systems, a suitably trained workforce and an appropriate level of expertise in a number of key management areas'. There was a loss per share of 11p, compared with restated earnings of 3.6p. The group paid a nominal final dividend of 0.1p, but forecast that the dividend for the current year would be not less than 0.5p. The rights issue has been fully underwritten by NM Rothschild, with BZW acting as brokers. Lex, Page 18</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 15 (XINHUA) -- Deng Xiaoping is in  pretty good health, said Deng Nan, vice-minister of the State  Science and Technology Commission, at a press conference held  here today.    Deng Nan, who is one of Deng Xiaoping's daughters, made the  remark at a news briefing, arranged by the information office of  the State Council, for "China's Agenda 21", which charts the  country's development course for the next century.    Deng Nan told reporters at the briefing that her father  cares  deeply about China's construction cause.    "He is much concerned with the entire implementation of the  targets set forth in the `China's Agenda 21'. Every day, my  father follows his routines and completes a set of work as  before. He reads a lot and goes for a stroll each day," said  Deng Nan, adding that they played bridge together the day before  yesterday.</p>

However,  it is heartening to know that postponed event has started this  week. Malaysian Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamed and the  foreign minister, Datuk Ahmad Badawi, are both in New Delhi.  This fact does underscore Malaysia's commitment to the  objectives of the Group of 15.    In the context of fast-moving events in our world today, a  gathering like the Group of 15 is a firm necessity. This aspect  of globalism is always being stressed by Dr. Mahathir. There is  no doubt whatsoever that Malaysia will continue to play a  leading role in this group. Some critics were skeptical about  the postponement. It had even been rumored that the New Delhi  meeting might be called off. Malaysia does not subscribe to  such negative attitudes. A specific idea that was conceived by  the Malaysian prime minister and worked on in detail by a team  of officials concerns the establishment of centers of  excellence. The New Delhi gathering will deliberate on this  innovative concept.    The need to sustain and spread education of high quality is  widely acknowledged. For the countries of the South, this is a  crucial sector. Malaysia's plan to start such centers in  suitable places should receive a positive response from the  other states that are attending the New Delhi meeting.    The past few years have witnessed the steady strengthening  of  the South awareness. New lines of communications have been  established. They can confidently forecast that the leaders will  review several issues of global concern. They will also map out  strategies toward coping with numerous areas of human endeavor.  A new wave of confidence in certainly in evidence as far as the  South countries are concerned. Their determination to lessen  dependence of the North has begun to produce concrete results.  Malaysia itself is a good example of the new South. It has  succeeded in becoming a highly diversified economy. By the year  2020, Malaysia will be a fully industrialized nation.  Therefore, there is no longer any need for the smaller and  poorer nations to run to the affluent West for guidance. It is  better, in everyone's long-term interest, to interact as much as  possible with other member states of the South.    In this connection, the New Delhi meeting is expected to  study the present UN set up. Concrete proposals will probably  merge for reforming the UN system. Drafted in the aftermath of  the Second World War, the UN Charter reflects the power  positions and the ambitions of the victorious nations in 1945.  The entire international system is in need of change to  accommodate the needs of the numerous nations of the South.    Whatever one chooses to call it, the New Delhi meeting will  be yet another step forward for the South. Malaysia will give  the South the fullest support.</p>

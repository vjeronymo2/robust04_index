			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Letter: Right ways for accountants to be regulated and improve image (2) Sir, The article 'Six ways to improve the profession's image' (Accountancy column, April 30) contained no reference to steps that have already been taken by the profession in these areas, namely: 1. The remit of the Accounting Standards Board undoubtedly includes the narrowing of options and the tightening of financial reporting standards. 2. Proposals from this institute to the Cadbury Committee include the role of audit committees in all public-interest entities. One of the duties of audit committees, containing independent non-executive directors only, would be to recommend auditor appointments and dismissals to the board. 3. We have recently published a paper recommending that auditors should approve the issue of interim accounts. 4. We (and others) also proposed to the Cadbury Committee that directors should report on the adequacy or otherwise of listed companies' internal controls and that auditors should attest the directors' statement. 5. The Auditing Practices Board is about to publish an exposure draft on a new form of auditors' report, including a proposal that the responsibilities of the directors for the preparation of financial statements should be distinguished from those of the auditors. Directors' responsibilities would therefore be highlighted. The need for auditors to draw attention to items of significance which may be buried in the notes to financial statements is also dealt with. 6. Procedures exist to cover the naming of members of the profession when serious 'public interest' cases result in disciplinary action against them. The coming months will see further progress on those matters that are still only at the proposal stage.

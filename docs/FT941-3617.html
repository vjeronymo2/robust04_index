			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / World Commodities Prices: Copper hits 6-month high - Market report London Metal Exchange COPPER prices built on Friday's surge in early trading, when the three months position reached a six-month high of Dollars 1,952 a tonne. Profit-taking then appeared and by the close it was back to Dollars 1,944.50, up Dollars 14.75 on the day, but traders remained confident that bullish charts, improving fundamentals, a shortage of good quality metal and a big expected drawdown from exchange warehouse stocks would help the market to mount an assault on upside resistance at Dollars 1,970 before long. Other base LME contracts fared less well, notably NICKEL, which fell Dollars 52.50 to Dollars 5,565 a tonne for three months delivery as it met trade selling and long liquidation in thin market conditions. COCOA futures climbed to the highest levels for nearly three months as fund buying in the US boosted values at the London Commodity Exchange. The May futures position closed at Pounds 957 a tonne, up Pounds 31 on the day. Traders saw the close above Pounds 950 as very constructive. 'The Pounds 949/Pounds 950 level was an important chart point,' one said. 'Until then people were selling into the market. Now they may be encouraged to cover shorts and even go long.'

			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / Letter: Feudal system is no safeguard of London's architectural heritage Sir, Colin Amery ('London's heritage in danger', November 9) criticises the disembowling of English Heritage with respect to its role in London and argues that 'the delicate architectural fabric of the capital' needs special treatment, ie a strong, independent, centralised body with the power to direct decisions on all listed building consent applications. I agree with this. However, I thoroughly disagree with Mr Amery's contention that preservation of London's architectural heritage requires retention of the feudal leasehold system. This is an argument currently being advanced by the London estates, the same estates that in 1967 protected their empires by arguing 'redevelopment' - the Cadogan Estate was offering at the time to knock down and redevelop a large part of Chelsea. London should not be relying on a group of disparate estates with differing standards and development agendas for preservation of its architectural heritage. This preservation argument rests on the fundamental assumption that the people who live in flats and houses in these special parts of London would not be concerned to protect their economic and quality of life interests. That assumption is flawed. People who spend hundreds of thousands of pounds to buy leases in central London where freeholds are not available are highly unlikely to allow their interests to be compromised. The small risk of a maverick property owner with alteration plans unsympathetic to the neighbourhood is virtually eliminated with a central planning authority with some teeth as advocated by Mr Amery. The author lauds the 'remarkably high standard' to which many estate squares and crescents are maintained. In fact, this is often the result of efforts made by the residents. I live on a square of 20 houses. We have a residents' association and all voluntarily contribute an annual assessment. We maintain the garden. This past year, we organised our own exterior painting to ensure that we had the job done efficiently and to the highest standard possible. The estate has responsibility for maintaining the garden railings and structures. Nothing has been done for years. Mr Amery specifically mentions Thurloe Square. He is presumably not aware that Thurloe Square itself is managed by a volunteer group of residents and maintenance is funded by annual membership subscriptions. Lastly, Mr Amery suggests that there are no 'intelligent alternative management proposals' to the estates. Once again, he is wrong. The proposals provide for sensible management schemes for common areas that the estates may adopt if they choose. Anne F Maxwell, 6 Alexander Square, London SW3 2AY</p>

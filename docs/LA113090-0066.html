			<p><P> November 30, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> WOULD-BE MURALISTS CONFESS TO GRAFFITI;  </P> <P> VANDALISM: POLICE LINK PAIR TO WEST VALLEY TAGGING. COUNCILWOMAN PICUS PLEDGED  CITY FUNDS FOR THEM TO COMPLETE RESEDA ART PROJECT.  </P> <P> Two teen-age graffiti artists commissioned by Los Angeles Councilwoman Joy  Picus to paint a historical mural have been arrested on suspicion of felony  vandalism for defacing property with spray paint throughout the west San  Fernando Valley, police said Thursday.  </P> <P> The youths -- Marco Cisneros, 15, and Larry Chavez, 16, both of Reseda -- were  arrested the day before Thanksgiving, said Los Angeles Police Lt. William  Gaida.  </P> <P> They confessed to "tagging" their nicknames on at least 76 mailboxes, telephone  poles and walls from Canoga Park to Van Nuys, causing $14,000 in damage, he  said.  </P> <P> "These two boys are not artists -- they're vandals," Gaida said. "We've  resolved a major vandalism problem."  </P> <P> Earlier this month, Picus pledged to provide $2,400 from the city's  anti-graffiti funds for a mural tracing the history of Reseda, which the boys  were to have painted under the aegis of a Venice arts organization. However,  Picus was unaware that one of the youths had been arrested twice before on  suspicion of misdemeanor vandalism, said Edward F. Roes, a Picus aide.  </P> <P> "It's a bummer," Roes said. "We figured they were young artists. We had no idea  of their criminal activities."  </P> <P> But after The Times reported the events leading to the historical mural  commission, police recognized the youths' tag names -- "Anger" and "Kosk,"  which stands for Krazy Obscene King, and arrested them, Gaida said.  </P> <P> The boys came to Picus' attention after they obtained a Reseda homeowner's  permission to paint a mural on a wall facing busy Vanowen Street. The mural,  depicting a bare-breasted woman wearing a bandoleer of ammunition being leered  at by a man with an extra-long tongue, provoked protests from passersby and  neighbors.  </P> <P> After the boys agreed earlier this month to replace the offending mural with  artwork on a Christmas theme, Picus commissioned the historical work as part of  an effort to redirect young graffiti artists. The mural was to be supervised by  the Social and Public Art Resource Center, or SPARC, a private, nonprofit  organization.  </P> <P> Roes said Picus will consult with police and SPARC members before deciding  whether to allow the youths to paint the historical mural or to rescind the  commission.  </P> <P> "We have no intention of supporting graffiti in any way," Roes said. "But it  may be a good idea to keep the kids on board as rehabilitation."  </P> <P> Alan Nakagawa, head of educational outreach for SPARC, said the youths should  be allowed to participate in the project.  </P> <P> "Although we don't endorse what they did, I'd like to see them continue on the  project to show them an alternative to graffiti," Nakagawa said. "The reality  is, a lot of the kids we hire are past taggers. Murals are one of the best ways  to deter that."  </P> <P> But Gaida said the youths did not learn their lesson from previous arrests and  should not be rewarded with the commission. One of the youths -- whom he would  not identify -- had been arrested twice before, on Sept. 1 and Nov. 5, by  officers who caught him in the act of spray-painting mailboxes and lampposts in  Reseda, he said.  </P> <P> When they were arrested Nov. 21, "they were somewhat proud of what they had  done," Gaida said. He is recommending that the boys be sentenced to community  service cleaning up graffiti. Both boys have been released pending sentencing,  he said.  </P> <P> Larry, who is known as "Kosk," said Thursday in a telephone interview that he  would like Picus to give him a second chance.  </P> <P> "The tagging was a way of getting fame, but it's in the past," he said, adding  that his parents had punished him by grounding him indefinitely.  </P></p>

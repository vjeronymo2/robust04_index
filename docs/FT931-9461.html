			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (America): US shares fall on uncertain outlook Wall Street IN spite of more good news on inflation, US share prices fell across the board yesterday in thin pre-holiday trading, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 30.26 at 3,392.43, at its lows for the day and the first time the index has been below 3,400 in more than a week. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 also ended lower, down 3.07 at 444.59, while the Amex composite finished 1.58 lower at 415.47, and the Nasdaq composite 5.34 weaker at 690.54. Trading volume on the NYSE was some 217m shares, and declines outnumbered rises by 1,100 to 740. Again, uncertainty about the outlook for equities dogged investors, who are worried that recent gains may have been overdone and that shares may be heading for a prolonged period of stagnation. One analyst noted yesterday that about 40 per cent of the S &amp; P 500 stocks have fallen substantially from their highs since a week ago - an indication that a significant correction may be under way. Such was the mood of the market that more good news on inflation, a modest 0.2 per cent rise in January producer prices, and yet further gains in bond prices (which pushed 30-year rates down to a historic low of 7.135 per cent) failed to generate any enthusiasm. The markets' poor performance, however, may have been affected by thin trading, with many participants taking the day off ahead of the weekend President's Day holiday. General Motors was one of the most actively traded issues, rising Dollars 1/8 to Dollars 40 5/8 in volume of 2.7m shares as investors continued to respond positively to Thursday's news of a turnround in operating earnings at the car manufacturer. The other two motor stocks, however, were both weaker, with Ford down Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 49 1/4 and Chrysler Dollars 1 lower at Dollars 39 7/8 . For the second consecutive day the prices of Student Loan Corp and the Student Loan Market Association (Sallie Mae) fell in heavy trading on reports that the Clinton administration is planning to replace the current guaranteed student loan programme with student loans issued directly by the government. Student Loan fell another Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars 18 5/8 and Sallie Mae plunged Dollars 4 3/4 to Dollars 58 1/2 . Schering-Plough rose Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 63 1/2 after the drug maker's board approved an additional Dollars 500m buy-back of shares. Weak technology stocks led the Nasdaq market lower. Microsoft fell Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 83 5/8 , Oracle Systems dropped Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 29 3/4 , Novell slipped Dollars 1 to Dollars 27 3/4 and Intel gave up Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 111. Canada TORONTO closed little changed as the market's two-week rally showed signs of running out of steam. According to preliminary data, the TSE-300 index closed up 2.38 points, or 0.07 per cent, at 3,445.55. Volume was 49.104m shares, down from 52.819m shares on Thursday.</p>

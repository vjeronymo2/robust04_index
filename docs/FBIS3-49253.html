			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Frane Plancic: "Montenegro Under Military </F> Management?"]    [Text] Serbian plans for Montenegro have long been known,  and they have long been implemented without any great problems,  in cooperation with [President of Montenegro] Bulatovic and  [Prime Minister] Djukanovic, the duo in power. What is not known  are the Serbian plans for solving the expected secessionist  crisis in Montenegro. However, there are certain indications of  these plans, such as the deployment of the means for a  preventative solution to this crisis by force, which have  already been carried out. Naturally, the matter involves the  Yugoslav Army (the Serbian armed forces), whose troops are on  the alert because of the "constant danger from Croatia and  Albania."    Belgrade is prepared to solve this "secessionist crisis"  either by introducing martial law or by war. In either case,  what Serbia must have is the following: territory clear of  Albanians and Croats, a short period to apply armed force,  achieved by deploying force on the crisis territories at the  appropriate time, and, finally, to keep the situation on the  borders with Albania and Croatia politically unstable, so that  "internal intervention" could be covered and justified by  external reasons.    The plans for the additional militarization of the Lustica  peninsula (the Boka Kotorska bay), Valdinos cove (near Ulcinj),  and Krnjicko Oko (on Lake Skadarsko) thus assume a clear  political and military meaning. Belgrade's plan is accompanied  by a request for building apartments for about 10,000 officers  and their families.    Most of all this is being planned in eastern Herzegovina,  densely populated by autochthonous Albanians. It clearly  follows that "cleansing" is being planned. At the same time,  Serbs are being settled in the area, so with additional  militarization a favorable "balance of power" in relation to the  Montenegrin "secessionists" is being achieved. The  militarization of Lustica and the advanced cleansing of the  autochthonous Croats in Boka is being guided by the same  principle.    The decision to turn the Lustica peninsula into a military  range and the construction of a naval port (base, stronghold) at  Valdinos is primarily an open threat to Montenegrin sovereignty,  and indirectly also to Croatia and Albania, since it is assumed  that these countries will act aggressively toward Montenegrin  territory.    The naval port of Valdinos does not only have a "land"  purpose (threatening the Montenegrin secessionists), but its  primary task is to hold the Serbian fleet that needs to secure  for Belgrade a part in controlling the sea and the traffic in  the wider Otranto area, especially when the lifting of the  sanctions or a laxer regime of navigation and traffic is  expected, as is constantly being announced in Belgrade. A more  acceptable explanation has been put forward in the Montenegrin  public -- that all this is a question of defense measures.    Viewed more passively, this represents the redeployment of  the fleet from Boka, where the ships are within the range of  Croatian weapons. Moreover, it would be difficult for the many  different ships and submarines to sail out on time, fast, and in  an orderly manner.    Valdinos Cove offers much better opportunities for active  defense measures, at least insofar as it is further from Croatia  and as it is easier to sail out of. However, all the other  conditions are less favorable than those at Boka. This cove is  only a mile long, the water 5 to 15 meters deep, and it is  surrounded by hills that are, on average, two to three times  lower than those at Boka, and open to strong winter winds. When  one sails out of the cove, as is the case with Boka, the ships  are in the open, at the mercy of a superior opponent from the  air, the sea, or under the sea. Particular drawbacks are the  fact that all the work has to be done from scratch (where will  this kind of money come from?), that it will take a long time,  and then there is also the hinterland with which Valdinos has  very weak traffic and other connections.    After all, is the best indication not Belgrade silently  overlooking the fact that Valdinos is not the best choice?  There are several coves more appropriate for the purpose, but  the "trouble" is that there is no Albanian or Croatian  population there.    While talking to several senior Croatian Navy officials, we  agreed that Montenegro (when it truly is Montenegro) will have  the legitimate right to establish its own navy, in accordance  with its defense needs, and also to take all passive and active  security measures. However, they stated that the warships at  Boka are neither Montenegrin property (but Serbian, while they  are waiting for the division to be legally resolved), nor a  factor of legitimate defense. Moreover, it is not such a bad  thing that the Serbian fleet has been moving further away from  our border.    It is quite another matter as to what will happen when  Montenegro becomes the Republic of Montenegro, and when it has  to defend itself on all sides against a spreading Belgrade  aggression. The Slovenes, Croatians, Muslims, and Albanians had  no other solution. It is therefore probably not necessary to  point out that we are not dealing with fools and politically  illiterate megalomaniacs such as Admiral Isakovic -- who  addresses the people from The Galeb [formerly Tito's ship] in  the manner of Tito -- but with clear-headed criminals who could  be said to rank among the most notorious in the world.</p>

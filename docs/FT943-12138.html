			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / US consumer confidence remains high US consumer confidence edged lower this month but remains close to a four-year high, the New York Conference Board, the business information group, said yesterday. Separate figures on employment costs indicated little evidence of upward pressure on wage inflation despite the robust economic recovery. The board said its index of consumer confidence fell to 91.6 against 92.5 in June. The decline was entirely accounted for by slightly less optimistic expectations for future growth and jobs; consumers' assessment of current economic conditions improved slightly. The survey is based on a sample of 5,000 households. Mr Fabian Linden, for the board, said the rise in the expectations component of the index 'suggests a continuation of steady, moderate economic growth in the second half of the year'. He noted encouraging shifts in buying intentions: plans to purchase cars registered a solid gain after declines in May and June; plans to buy homes were also up, although not to levels of earlier this year. Consumers, however, said they were less likely to buy household appliances. The employment cost index - a broad measure of labour costs that includes fringe benefits as well as wages and salaries - rose 0.9 per cent in the three months ending in June, against 0.7 per cent in the previous quarter. The annual increase for private industry workers was 3.4 per cent in June against 3.3 per cent in March. Wage and salary inflation has edged up slightly since the end of 1992 but the impact on overall employment costs has been more than offset by a sharp fall in inflation of benefits.</p>

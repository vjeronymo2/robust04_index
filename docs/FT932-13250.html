			<p>930423 FT  23 APR 93 / International Company News: Tandem's earnings below expectations TANDEM Computers reported an increase in second-quarter earnings but failed to live up to Wall Street expectations. The US manufacturer of fault-tolerant mainframe computers said that although sales picked up in the US, revenues continue to decline in Europe. Net income for the quarter was Dollars 11.1m, or 10 cents per share, compared with Dollars 8.8m , or 8 cents, in the same period last year. Revenues rose to Dollars 517.6m from Dollars 502.9m a year ago. 'Although we anticipated a weak quarter, the computer business exceeded its profit goals, but our Ungermann-Bass networking subsidiary fell below its revenue, margin, and profit targets,' said Mr James Treybig, president and chief executive. 'For the seventh consecutive quarter, business in the US posted year-over-year revenue growth, gaining 13 per cent over the same quarter of the prior year,' Mr Treybig noted. 'Non-European international revenues showed modest growth. Although some countries in Europe achieved revenue gains, revenues from the European division declined.' Tandem is one of many computer companies that is making a transition from proprietary technology to open systems based on industry standards. The company is also developing lower-priced, server products based on the latest Risc technology. For the first six months of fiscal 1993, revenues were Dollars 1bn and net income Dollars 28.6m or 25 cents a share, including a Dollars 12.4m, or 11 cents-per-share gain from a tax accounting change. In the first half of fiscal 1992 Tandem posted revenues of Dollars 957.4m and a net loss of Dollars 85.8m, or 79 cents, after a Dollars 98m pre-tax restructuring charge taken in the first quarter.</p>

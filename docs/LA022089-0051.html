			<p><P> February 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> The Hartford Insurance Group of Connecticut announced plans to shut down  clerical operations in Brea in Orange County and Walnut Creek in Northern  California, effective May 26. It said 205 workers at the two facilities must  either transfer to operations in other states or lose their jobs. Sixty-five  employees at a Brea underwriting and service center and 140 employees at a  Walnut Creek processing center will be affected. The offices will be closed  because of cost-cutting measures and the increased use of automation.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 14, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMPTON  </P> <P> The report on present-day Compton ("Black Middle Class Keeps the Faith for  Compton," Part I, June 26) and its proud residents is a lucid testimonial not  only on pride of ownership, but also pride of community.  </P> <P> The article should be read by all ethnic groups who, despite social stigma and  stereotypes nurtured by bigots believing in "exclusive neighborhoods," continue  to think that the latter is the sole way to go on the road to the American  success story. The Compton story defies this.  </P> <P> May there be more community-conscious individuals like those Compton folks, and  may their tribe increase!  </P> <P> LUDY ASTRAQUILLO ONGKEKO  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

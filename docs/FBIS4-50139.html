			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Li Jie (2621 2638) and XINHUA </F> reporter Gu Yuezhong (7357 2508 1813)]    [Text] Zhengzhou, 13 May (XINHUA) -- May 14 of this year is  the 30th anniversary of the death of Comrade Jiao Yulu. At  General Secretary Jiang Zemin's request, Hu Jintao, member of  the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau Standing Committee  and member of the CPC Central Committee Secretariat, gave an  important speech at a meeting today called by the Hunan  provincial party committee to mark the occasion. He stressed  that all party members and people of all nationalities in the  country acknowledge the fact that Comrade Jiao Yulu was a good  party member and a good public servant as a county party  committee secretary whose good example should be emulated by the  vast number of cadres. Hu Jintao said that emulating and  fostering Jiao Yulu's spirit is a requirement set for this great  era, a call made by people of all nationalities in the country,  and a need for building a stronger party and expediting the  socialist modernization.    The meeting was chaired by Ren Keli, deputy secretary of the  Henan provincial party committee. Li Changchun, secretary of  the Henan provincial party committee; and Lu Dawei, secretary of  the Lankao County party committee, also took the floor at the  meeting.    On behalf of the CPC, Hu Jintao expressed its profound  remembrance of Comrade Jiao Yulu, its sincere sympathy to  Comrade Jiao Yulu's family, and its high respects for those  Communist Party members, cadres, and other progressive elements  who have fostered Jiao Yulu's spirit and distinguished  themselves in reforms, opening up, and the modernization drive.  Hu Jintao emphatically noted: Comrade Jiao Yulu's life was one  in which he dedicated himself entirely to the party's cause and  the people's interests. While striving to attain the highest  ideal -- communism -- Jiao Yulu also worked earnestly, dedicated  himself entirely, strove to explore, served the people  wholeheartedly, relied closely on the people, and always linked  his heart with those of the people. The brilliant image of an  outstanding Communist Party member and cadre, which he created  with his personal deeds, has become a majestic monument in the  hearts of the people. Over the past three decades, his moving  deeds have educated and inspired thousands upon thousands of  party members, cadres, and people to move forward, and his great  spirit will continue to shine brilliantly in history.    Hu Jintao said: Our objective at this stage is to build  socialism with Chinese characteristics. The requirement of  overall importance for the whole party and the whole nation now  is to seize the opportunity, deepen reform, open up wider to the  outside world, expedite development, and maintain stability.  Under the new situation, it has become even more necessary for  us to uphold the party's goal of serving the people  wholeheartedly, inherit and carry forward the party's fine style  of forging close ties with the masses and wage arduous struggle,  and emulate and foster Jiao Yulu's spirit. Hu Jintao urged the  vast number of party members and cadres to do the following:    -- Follow Jiao Yulu's example and establish the footing  based  on the current situation, keep the future in mind, and combine  efforts to achieve the lofty goal -- communism -- with efforts  to achieve socialist modernization; firmly adhere to the party's  basic line characterized by "one center, two basic points,"  heighten their sense of responsibility and sense of mission in  building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and demonstrate  their values while carrying out reforms, opening to the outside  world, and proceeding with the modernization drive.    -- Follow Jiao Yulu's example and serve the people  wholeheartedly, forge close ties with them, do everything for  them, trust them, and rely on them in everything. While  deepening reforms, in particular, we must have a stronger  concept of the masses, adhere to the mass line, understand the  masses' views, strive to solve the hot issues and problems about  which the masses care, properly handle all types of  contradictions among the masses, firmly take root among the  masses, and serve the people conscientiously.    -- Follow Jiao Yulu's example and firmly adhere to the  party's ideological line of seeking truth from facts, proceed  from practical needs in doing everything, speak the truth, do  practical work, explore with courage, and work creatively. We  must strive to have a firm grip of the essence of Marxism --  namely, emancipating minds and seeking truth from facts -- make  painstaking efforts to study and master the scientific view and  world outlook and methodology, comprehensively understand and  carry out the party's lines and general and specific policies as  well as all its reform measures, correctly understand and handle  contradictions and problems, guard against one-sidedness and any  tendency of doing things in terms of absolutes, combat  subjectivism and recklessness, and make constant efforts to  improve leadership and proficiency.    -- Follow Jiao Yulu's example and defy hardship, confront  dangers dauntlessly, fight with fortitude, and make painstaking  efforts in launching pioneering projects. A great cause needs a  great spirit. Waging arduous struggle is both a lofty spirit  and a great force needed to cut through thorns and proceed with  an exploratory spirit. The spirit of waging arduous struggle is  particularly needed when we encounter problems during reform and  construction. We must defy hardship and danger, and by no means  should we be cowed by them and do nothing. We must make  constant efforts to make ourselves stronger and proceed  courageously with an exploratory spirit, and by no means should  we follow the beaten path and make no efforts to press forward.  We must work hard and practice economy and treasure the wealth  created by the people, and by no means should we go in for  ostentation and extravagance, compete with one another in  showing off opulence, and waste our resources.    -- Follow Jiao Yulu's example and carry out official duties  honestly and work diligently for the people. Party and  government cadres, especially those in leading positions, must  follow Jiao Yulu's example and temper their party spirit,  consider the party cause first in doing everything, set strict  requirements for themselves, correctly exercise the power given  by the people, work hard to provide the people with practical  and useful services, and live up to the people's expectations by  firmly fighting corruption.    Hu Jintao concluded: Party committees at all levels must  consider emulating and fostering Jiao Yulu's spirit to be an  important task of ideological construction in party and  government organs, an important task of intensifying socialist  spiritual construction, and an important task of expediting  reform, opening up, and socialist modernization. Continual  efforts must be made until success has been achieved. While  emulating and fostering the spirit of Jiao Yulu, we must also  carry out the guidelines laid down by the 14th party congress  and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee,  study Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping, and safeguard and promote reform, development,  and development, which are requirements of overall importance.  During this process, we must strive to cultivate and bring up  thousands upon thousands of good party members and cadres like  Jiao Yulu. Leading cadres at all levels must take the lead in  setting the example with their personal deeds. They must  improve their proficiency in various fields so that they can  attain new successes and make even greater contributions during  the great cause of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics!    Present at the meeting were Lu Feng, head of the CPC Central  Committee Organization Department; Zeng Qinghong, director of  the CPC Central Committee General Office; Zheng Keyang, deputy  director of the Central Policy Research Center; and Duan Junyi,  Wang Congwu, Liu Jie, Mu Qing, and other veteran comrades as  well as persons in charge of relevant central departments.    Also present at the meeting were persons in charge of party,  government, and military departments in Henan.</p>

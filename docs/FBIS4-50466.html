			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Roundup: Performance of Shanghai's Economy Improves"] </F>   [Text] Shanghai, May 17 (XINHUA) -- Known as "China's  economic barometer," Shanghai's economy continues to operate  smoothly despite such adverse factors as raw materials price  hikes, shortage of fund supply and sluggish market.    According to the municipal statistics bureau, Shanghai's  gross domestic product (GDP) this year is expected to surpass  the 13-percent increase of last year and reach the year's target.    Although industry, of which the output accounts for 60  percent of the GDP, slipped early this year, it began to pick up  in March, and jumped by 16 percent in April in comparison with  the same period of last year. The ratio between sales volume  and output reached 97.5 percent last month.    As a result of streamlining the foreign trade structure,  improving the mechanism for encouraging exports and the  municipal government's policy of promoting foreign trade,  Shanghai exported a record 2.46 billion U.S. dollars-worth of  goods in the first four months of this year, up 26.6 percent  over the same period last year.    The city's improving investment conditions have aroused the  interest of foreign business people, who set up 1,256  foreign-funded projects with the approval of the municipal  government in the January-April period.    These projects involved a combined investment of 2.89  billion  U.S. dollars, and some of them were funded by trans-national  corporations.    However, a local official said there are still problems in  the economy.    He analysed the situation as follows: "One third of  state-owned enterprises suffer from losses which are caused by  poor enterprise management, price hikes for raw materials and  the unification of the dual exchange rate system. They result  in a rise in production costs and hurt the enterprises badly."    Other factors include shortages of funds, inflation and  sluggish markets.    The official noted that though Shanghai's inflation rate is  lower than those of many other major cities in the country, it  still affects the living standard of the lower-income people,  retired people in particular.    However, experts here agree that Shanghai's economy is  developing steadily thanks to the high input into the economy  over the past few years, the increasing rationality of the  economic structure, and the smooth reforms of the tax, banking  and social security systems.    In line with the economic situation in the first four months  of this year, the municipal government has decided to rearrange  its credits and loans with the focus on supporting key  enterprises, especially major foreign trade enterprises.    It urged industrial departments to take the marketing of  industrial products as the most important task in order to boost  production.    Meanwhile, related government departments have begun to help  enterprises in the red to change their operational mechanism and  make up deficits and increase surpluses in the process of market  competition step by step.    In addition, the city is looking for a new way to make an  overall opening to the outside world while continuously  implementing the reform measures.    Economists believe that the municipal quota of a 12-percent  growth in the economy and striving to attain 15 percent this  year can be obtained on the condition that the macro-economic  environment does not deteriorate.</p>

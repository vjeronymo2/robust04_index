			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Fishing: SOS - save our salmon I CAUGHT my first salmon on a breathlessly hot August day a quarter of a century ago. Expert opinion held that conditions on the Cumberland Eden were hopeless: the water low and scummy, the few fish stale and sullen. But somehow I had to be kept quiet, so the keeper thrust a spinning rod at me and bid me do my worst. When he saw my six pounder, he raised a hairy eyebrow, muttered something about 'beginner's luck,' and shook me warmly by the hand. I can recall the capture of my last salmon pretty clearly, too - a gleaming fish of seven pounds taken on fly in the shadow of Ashford Castle hotel in the west of Ireland, with a admiring gallery of guests watching the fun. And I can see each of the salmon which came between those two triumphs - all eight of them. Ten salmon in 25 years is not an impressive tally. But I am not a salmon fisherman. In fact, speaking purely as a catcher of fish, I could do without salmon. For the trouble with salmon fishing is that it is such a business. You have to arrange it months in advance. You must travel vast distances. Once there, there is little else to do but fish, and since you have paid thousands for it, do it you must. I haven't the money, the connections, or the hunger. But I still love the salmon, and the thought that this wonderful creature - with its extraordinary, epic life cycle - might one day be lost to our rivers is odious. It may be a cliche, but we would all - salmon fishermen, trout fishermen, non-fishermen, members of the League Against Cruel Sports - be diminished by such a loss. Is it possible? There is no doubt that things are bad. Reports from the Scottish rivers show that last season was calamitous. The story was broadly the same west, north and east. Stocks of fish were pitifully small, catches unprecedently low. It is not surprising that lamentations north of the border should have reached such a pitch of rage and despair. Great effort and expense have been expended there - particularly in buying off the estuary netting stations. Yet the decline accelerates. The great question is whether we should blame nature, or ourselves. There is a theory - which I am too ignorant to assess - that the numbers of salmon have waxed and waned on a cyclical basis through the ages. It is said to be something to do with climate, enforcing mass migration of the food on which salmon grow fat at sea. If we are patient, the balance will tilt again, possibly within our lifetime - possibly not. The advantage of blaming ourselves is that it offers the hope - maybe illusory - that something can be done. Look at what we do to the salmon. We destroy its spawning grounds with acid rain and poison the estuaries through which it must swim. We net it in those estuaries, and at sea. We steal its food, for use as fertiliser or heating oil. We pollute the seas, and everything that in them lives. Oh - anglers catch a few. Reluctant governments can be forced to act. Take the case of the infamous north-east England drift net fishery. For years the fishing interests in Scotland - where this atrocious practice was banned decades ago - have gnashed their teeth at the interception of tens of thousands of salmon bound for east coast rivers such as the Tweed and the Spey. The Agriculture Minister, John Gummer, hummed and hawed, until the pressure became too much. Last autumn - belatedly and grudgingly - he announced that the fishery would be phased out. So it can be done. Let us, therefore, holler at the Irish until they enforce the ban on netting salmon off Donegal. Let us shame the Danes into ending the plundering of sand eels in the North Sea. Let us pray that the EC produces measures to protect fish stocks while there are still stocks to protect. Will any of this happen? One sighs, despondently, for the omens are not encouraging. Governments prefer words to deeds. Action is only taken when conclusive evidence is furnished - and usually not then. The problem when dealing with something as complex as the survival of a species is that the only conclusive evidence tends to take the form of extinction.</p>

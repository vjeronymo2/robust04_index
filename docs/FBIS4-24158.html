			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] At a news conference in Maputo today, Dr. Brazao  Mazula, chairman of the National Election Commission [CNE],  spoke of the latest developments on the electoral process in the  country. Germano de Sousa reports:    [De Sousa] This afternoon CNE Chairman Brazao Mazula told  correspondents that 20 percent of voting age Mozambicans have  already registered throughout the country. This percentage  represents 1.7 million voters. Mazula said at the news  conference that a new timetable will be announced soon for the  registration of a specified group of voters, who in view of  circumstances cannot register within the established timetable.  The people who will benefit from this include refugees still in  neighboring countries and soldiers confined in different  assembly areas waiting to hear their fate.    Two issues considered important did not have definite  answers  at the news conference. They are the issues of emigrants who  still do not have approval to vote in the election and the trust  fund for the operation of political parties. Mazula said these  two issues are discussed in almost all the CNE meetings. Mazula  also said that the CNE has not yet issued guidelines on the  operation of mobile voter registration teams, an issue which  raises doubts about the voting process by the electorate in the  areas concerned.

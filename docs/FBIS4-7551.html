			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, March 31 (CTK) -- Relevant ministers, who  met to discuss the Czech arms industry and its transformation,  have decided to divide long-term defense contracts into two  groups according to their importance to the state, Premier  Vaclav Klaus said today.    Within six months, the Ministry of Defense will work out a  proposal describing its expected contracts with Czech arms  producers. One group of items will contain those with direct  effect on the country's security interests. The other defined  group will involve less government attention, Klaus said.    He noted that the state does not plan to organize arms  exports. It will simply ensure that competition in the arms  industry is not lessened, and that no laws are broken.    Defense Minister Antonin Baudys said before the ministers'  meeting that Czech companies will be allowed to participate in  the country's arms conversion process according to their  abilities. Discussions with them will start once the ministry  has drawn up its proposal.    Arms conversion in the Czech Republic could be carried out  over five to ten years, Baudys noted.    Most important, said Deputy Foreign Minister Alexandr  Vondra,  is for the Czech armed forces to state their modernization needs  and for the state to be ready to cooperate with arms producers.    The issue of re-equipping is not the only path to  compatibility with NATO, he added.</p>

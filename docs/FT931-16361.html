			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / Observer: Diplomatic choice There is nothing like a royal wedding to buck up the masses. Japan's Crown Prince Naruhito has done his bit to reform the tradition-bound Imperial Family by choosing a thoroughly modern, multilingual, 29-year-old diplomat as his bride, and presumably the country's next empress. The 32-year-old prince is to marry Masako Owada, a graduate of Harvard and Oxford, and the daughter of vice foreign minister Hisashi Owada. As well as much rejoicing by Japanese television hosts and newspapers, the announcement was greeted with enthusiasm by business leaders such as Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Keidanren. Many Japanese had feared that the crown prince would be condemned to bachelorhood, as potential brides balked either at the massive media coverage that his attentions generated or at the thought of a life of refined confinement behind the palace walls. The present empress, Michiko, also a commoner, is known to have had a tough time adjusting to the conservative ways of the Imperial Household Agency. But the crown prince's choice of a tennis-playing environmentalist was generally interpreted by ponderous Imperial Household-watchers last night as a sign that he intends to make the family less cloistered and more international, a not so easy task for the heir to a chrysanthemum throne still ascribed supernatural powers by Shinto theology.</p>

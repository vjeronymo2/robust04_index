			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1992 (2): The information imperative - Comment Today's technology now gives managers the ability to choose the exact level of business information they need - but without the right training, this crucial selection process may prove difficult and lead to data overload FOR THE first time, perhaps, since the beginning of the modern computer era, business people have the opportunity to make information their servant, rather than their master. The reasons for this profound shift in the business paradigm are to do with improvements in technology: with the growth of distributed computing systems, client-server architectures and object-orientated programming - all topics that have been dealt with in recent issues of Software at Work. Making the most of the opportunity will mean that, also for the first time, executives will have to take the responsibility for choosing and defining their information requirements. Peter Drucker, doyen among management experts, recently told a seminar that people at every level must develop information responsibility: 'They must ask themselves what information they need to do their job, when, from whom and in what form, and what information they owe to other people. 'The right answer is not 'as much as possible,' but 'as little as possible'  -only what I need, because otherwise I cannot digest it,' Drucker argued. Executives, however, may find it hard to decide on the information that is most important for their job. They have become used to the systems department dictating what information they can have and when. Staff will have to be trained to define their information needs. Early attempts to give senior managers information at their fingertips failed for a variety of reasons; the inflexibility of the systems and a reluctance among top managers to use keyboards put paid to early 'executive information systems,' (EIS). Robert Cringely, a US industry observer, notes in his gossipy book Accidental Empires: 'The idea was that the Big Boss would be able to look into the bowels of the company and know instantly how many widgets were being produced in the Muncie plant . . . but American business executives didn't know how to type and didn't want to learn.' Those who did develop keyboard skills, however, were hardly able to roam at will through the thousands of megabytes of information which constituted their company files. Essentially, those early systems provided an electronic slide show; a way of looking at information, carefully prepared by data processing staff. In many companies it became a computerised version of the 'Blue Book' (or Red Book or Green Book), the collection of key business statistics, updated monthly. The electronic version might be updated minute by minute and it might allow its users to 'drill down' through layers of data to investigate exceptions and anomalies, but it remained essentially a static record, prepared in advance. Free-ranging enquiries were simply not possible. Professor Enid Mumford, one of the UK's leading computing academics, outlined the problem in a recent paper: 'Developers tend to assume that all managers have the same needs and this belief can turn EIS into information straight-jackets, instead of providers of relevant data. The attempt to provide 'general solutions' has failed because all companies do not have the same business problems. Also the complexity of today's business environment means that problems are becoming more different, rather than more similar, even in the same industry.' The term EIS, in any case, is looking dated. First, because it is now appreciated that it is not only 'executives' who need access to corporate data, but employees at every level of the organisation. Second, because there should be no need of a special system to provide information of the right quality. As John Kavanagh illustrates in his articles on personnel systems in this issue of Software at Work, substantial efficiencies and economies should flow from any properly designed management information systems. Designing a system properly, however, is a big challenge. Professor Mumford - best-known for her research on the ways in which humans interact with computer systems  -has an interest to declare because she is now commercially associated with an innovative new management information technology, but her criticism of the inflexibility of earlier EIS systems is well taken. As this issue makes clear, the personnel area is one where software packages have been designed to allow personnel people to define the information they want. Generally, however, managers tend to identify the data they used most recently; or they concentrate on the information used by their own department ignoring the wider needs of the company. Her solution involves a combination of group discussions and with a cybernetic model derived from the work of Professor Stafford Beer designed for the analysis of managers' roles and responsibilities. The model provides the basis for the group discussion through which managers agree the problems they wish to address - and the information needed to address them. Professor Mumford's approach may not suit every company, but it is an important step in the right direction. Instead of bombarding everyone with everything, it is important to provide the right information to the people who need it.</p>

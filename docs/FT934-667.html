			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / Auditors stress Euro Disney crisis Euro Disney's auditors have warned that the troubled leisure group will be forced to close if it cannot persuade its banks to restructure its finances. PS Audit, a subsidiary of Price Waterhouse, has qualified Euro Disney's accounts for the year to September 30. 'The company will need financial support in order to meet its contractual obligations for the 1994 accounting year,' it said. It also warned that if the refinancing 'is not completed in sufficient time', the group will 'have liquidity problems and will not be able to continue'. Euro Disney, which last month reported a net loss of FFr5.3bn (Dollars 900m) on turnover of FFr5.7bn, is trying to negotiate a financial rescue package with 60 international banks. Its net debt totals FFr20.3bn. Walt Disney, the US entertainment group that owns 49 per cent of Euro Disney, warned the banks last month that Euro Disney was on the brink of bankruptcy and that the lavish EuroDisneyland theme park outside Paris would close if they did not agree to the restructuring. 'The auditor's statement hasn't told us anything we didn't already know,' said one of the bankers involved. 'But it does emphasise the fact that Euro Disney is in deep, deep trouble.' Euro Disney said yesterday that it was still financially self-sufficient, but that it risks running out of cash - thereby becoming technically bankrupt - early next year. Walt Disney has promised to provide enough money to keep the park afloat while the restructuring is completed - but itssupport will only last until March 31. The Disney camp hopes to pressurise the banks into reaching an early agreement, thereby defusing the uncertainty over Euro Disney's future and minimising the amount of money that Walt Disney will have to plough in. But the negotiations are on ice because the banks have commissioned an investigative audit of Euro Disney's finances. KPMG, the accountancy group, was appointed last week and is expected to complete its report in January. Walt Disney has proposed that the banks reduce Euro Disney's net debt to around FFr10bn through such measures as a debt-for-equity swap and a rights issue. The banks are expected to insist that the parent also waives or postpones royalty payments from Euro Disney. Rights issue prospects are clouded by the recent slide in Euro Disney's shares, which yesterday shed another FFr1.40 to FFr34.10. The only consolation for Euro Disney is that the Christmas season has so far been busier than in 1992. World stock markets, Page 27</p>

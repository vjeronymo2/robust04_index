			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Weaker drug shares take shine off Dow Wall Street US SHARE prices held steady in busy trading yesterday as financial markets wound down for the Christmas holidays, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 7.56 at 3,313.54, its low for the day. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 finished 1.28 off at 439.03 but the Nasdaq composite added 2.12 at 662.96, a record high. Trading volume on the New York SE amounted to 234m shares and rises narrowly outpaced declines by 935 to 882. Stocks opened slightly firmer, but struggled to hold on to the early modest gains, primarily because pharmaceutical issues were mostly weaker following downgrades by some Wall Street brokers. The day's economic news was mixed. Personal income rose 0.2 per cent and personal spending by 0.5 per cent last month, both signs of a healthier economy. November durable goods orders, however, fell 1.9 per cent, an unexpected decline after the previous month's strong gain of 4.6 per cent. The durable goods orders figures are notoriously volatile, so most investors ignored the data. ADRs in Glaxo retreated Dollars 1 to Dollars 23 in volume of 6.9m shares, making the stock the busiest of the day. Selling was prompted by news that analysts at Wall Street broking houses Smith Barney and Lehman Brothers had cut their ratings on the drug stock. Other drug shares were notably weaker, even though most of their ratings were left untouched by the broking houses. Pfizer dropped Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 74 in turnover of 2.1m shares, Merck Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 45, Johnson &amp; Johnson Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 51 5/8 and Schering-Plough Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 65 1/2 . Honeywell fell Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 32 1/8 in busy trading after Mr Christopher Steffen, the company's chief financial officer, resigned unexpectedly. The company has not yet found a successor. Advanced Micro slipped Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 17 5/8 after Merrill Lynch lowered its near-term rating on the stock from 'above average' to 'neutral'. IBM weakened slightly, giving back some of the gain earned in Tuesday's mini-rally. Market sentiment remains set against IBM, at least until the uncertainty surrounding the dividend is removed. The stock shed Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 51 1/4 in volume of 4.2m shares. On the Nasdaq market, Oracle Systems surged Dollars 8 1/2 , or 44 per cent, to Dollars 27 7/8 in turnover of 5.7m shares after several analysts raised their ratings for the stock after the company reported second-quarter net income of 23 cents a share, up from a year-earlier 10 cents. Canada THE TORONTO market ended slightly stronger after slow, sleepy dealings as recent interest rate cuts continued to prop up Canada's heavier-weighted shares. The TSE 300 Index rose 9.6 to 3,323.1 and advances led falls by 348 to 216 after volume of 28.9m shares. United Reef Petroleum, which announced a diamond find earlier this week, led the actives list. The stock ended 36 cents ahead at a 52-week high of CDollars 2.28 after turnover of 1.7m shares. High-flying but volatile telecommunications stock Newbridge Networks forged ahead CDollars 3 1/2 to CDollars 53 1/2 .</p>

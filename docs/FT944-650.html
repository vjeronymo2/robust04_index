			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / BNF loses German contract for Thorp British Nuclear Fuels has lost a multi-million-pound German contract for its Thorp reprocessing plant because of pressures from the anti-nuclear lobby. The cancellation is a blow for BNF, which is currently negotiating a number of long-term contracts for the plant at Sellafield, Cumbria, which was built over 10 years at a cost of Pounds 2.5bn. It comes just a year after BNF won a licence to operate Thorp, after a bitterly contested battle with environmentalists in which BNF put great weight on Thorp's economic prospects. The Krummel nuclear power station in northern Germany has told BNF that it has decided to dispose of spent fuel from its reactors in an underground repository instead. Krummel is 50 per cent owned by Hamburgische Elektrizitatswerke, the municipal utility controlled by the city of Hamburg which is run by the Social Democrat party. The Social Democrats oppose nuclear reprocessing because it produces plutonium. Direct disposal has become possible in Germany this year after law changes and the start of construction of a repository in Gorleben, north-west Germany. Direct disposal is cheaper than reprocessing. The cancelled contract covers the second 10 years of Thorp's operation, from 2004 to 2014, and involves around 125 tonnes of spent fuel. Krummel still has a contract for the first 10 years which it will see through because Gorleben will be unable to accept spent fuel for a number of years. BNF said it was disappointed by the cancellation, but pointed out that the contract represented only 4 per cent of the order book for Thorp's second 10 years. The owners of the Krummel plant would also have to pay 'significant' cancellation charges. The company said the value of the contract was less than 1 per cent of the Pounds 9bn revenues so far secured for Thorp. In order to secure German contracts, BNF has been offering opt-out clauses, but the cancellation charges rise each year. They are due to rise again on January 1.</p>

			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Letter: Costs indicate need for a national childcare strategy Sir, Your report, 'Real cost of childcare rises steeply' (August 5), made interesting reading, largely because the figures you quote do not correspond to the real cost of full-time childcare in the UK. Perhaps the average weekly spend includes part-time childcare, and hence does not give an indication of the average cost of full-time childcare. In the interests of informed debate on the general inaccessibility of good, affordable childcare, against the background of the recent 'home alone' case, I suggest that the following costs are the norm in London: Full-time nursery, Pounds 60-Pounds 184 a week, with most nurseries charging in excess of Pounds 130 a week for children under two years. The costs are largely governed by the staff: child ratios set out in the Children Act Guidelines. Full-time, live-out nanny, Pounds 150-Pounds 200 a week net. A parent paying Pounds 180 a week net must also pay Pounds 95 tax, employee's NIC and employer's NIC, making a total cost of Pounds 275 a week. Hence the need for a national childcare strategy and a revisiting of the tax relief debate. Helen Jameson, 39 Blandford Road, London W4 1DX</p>

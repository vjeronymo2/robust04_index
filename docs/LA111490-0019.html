			<p><P> November 14, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> 22 OF FURNISHING 2000 STORES WILL OPEN FOR 3-MONTH LIQUIDATION SALE  </P> <P> Furnishings 2000, which entered bankruptcy proceedings in September, will  reopen 22 of its 31 stores in California on Saturday for a three-month  liquidation sale. When the sale is completed in February, the troubled  furniture retailer will close all its stores in Southern California.  </P> <P> The Mira Loma-based furniture store chain owes an estimated $20 million to $30  million to creditors, including about $1.2 million to customers who made down  payments on furniture never delivered, said Don Vesey, a Northern California  mattress manufacturer who serves as chairman of Furnishings 2000's creditors'  committee.  </P> <P> Initial proceeds of the liquidation sale, expected to gross about $40 million,  will be used to "take care of consumers" who made those down payments, Vesey  said.  </P> <P> General Electric Credit Corp. is Furnishing 2000's only secured creditor, with  a $6.5-million claim, Vesey said. Its other creditors are mainly wholesalers  and manufacturers.  </P> <P> Because of inventory constraints, Furnishings 2000 won't be able to supply  every customer with specific merchandise ordered before the stores entered  Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings.  </P> <P> Furnishings 2000 on Tuesday began sending letters to customers with down  payments on undelivered furniture. Customers who don't receive letters should  seek assistance at a nearby store, a spokeswoman said.  </P> <P> Furnishings 2000 stores in Puente Hills, San Bernardino, Lancaster, Corona,  Artesia, Anaheim, Redondo Beach, West Los Angeles and Van Nuys will reopen  Saturday for the sale.  </P> <P> In San Diego County, Furnishings 2000 will reopen stores in El Cajon and the  Clairemont area of San Diego. Stores in Bakersfield, Chula Vista, Downey,  Glendale, Orange, San Marcos, Santa Ana, Upland, Venture and West Covina will  not reopen for the sale.  </P> <P> In Northern California, 11 stores will reopen Saturday.  </P> <P> Although Furnishings 2000 will close all its remaining Southern California  stores when the sale ends in February, its 11 Northern California stores will  remain open indefinitely, with profits earmarked for unsecured creditors whose  debts are not covered by profits from the liquidation sale, Vesey said.  </P></p>

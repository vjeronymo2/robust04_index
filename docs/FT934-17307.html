			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Buy-out at McCarthy &amp; Stone management arm  -Proceeds will help to reduce housebuilder's debt MCCARTHY &amp; STONE, the Bournemouth-based housebuilder specialising in retirement housing schemes, is disposing of Peverel, its management company, in a Pounds 30.7m management buy-out. The company, which incurred a pre-tax loss of nearly Pounds 20m in the year to August 31 1992, will be using the proceeds to reduce its Pounds 50m bank borrowings by Pounds 20m and to fund new development. Peverel manages about 17,000 retirement flats and houses in more than 400 private developments, mostly built by McCarthy. It will retain the McCarthy man-agement contracts and its freehold and leasehold interests. The buy-out, led by Mr Nigel Bannister, Peverel's managing director, is mostly equity-financed by Electra, the in-vestment institution, with some debt financing from Bank of Scotland and 5 per cent from the management team. Peverel made a Pounds 3.7m pre-tax profit in the year to August 1992 and had a net asset value of Pounds 5.1m. McCarthy's sales have dropped from 2,600 units a year before the recession to about 1,000, although Mr John McCarthy, chairman, said yesterday it was now seeing an improvement. 'It is the right time to reinvest in land and in our core business and to realise a non-performing asset - the freeholds and leaseholds,' he said. The disposal of Peverel would also end, he said, what some saw as a conflict between the roles of developer and manager. Peverel was originally an estate agency acquired by McCarthy in 1982, the year that the parent company was floated on the stock market. It is retaining its existing management team and staff and will be seeking to expand by winning other management contracts.</p>

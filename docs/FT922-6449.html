			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Travel: Boutique hotels hit town - A luxurious and intimate experience not a pretty name. In London, they do not seem to have any recognised name at all. But if the recently-coined term 'town house hotel' has yet to catch on in London, the establishments it describes have. Hidden away, meticulously managed, and each with an intimate atmosphere entirely its own, London's small luxury hotels can make their better-known cousins seem not so much grand as over-sized. More than 1,100 hotels cater to 17m visitors in London each year, and there are plenty that are neither large nor cheap. Yet there are only 25 or so that fall into the small, luxury 'town house' bracket - something like 300 rooms in all. Generally, these hotels are to be found in converted private houses in quiet residential streets. Invariably, they serve a full morning meal, though only a few have a restaurant of their own. None are members of a hotel chain, and are instead privately owned. What is it that makes these hotels something other than glorified B &amp; Bs? Not long ago I went on a four-day bed-hopping spree to find out. A stones's throw from the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Egerton House Hotel sits in a street off the Brompton Road in Knightsbridge. Like its owner, David Naylor Leyland, it is discreet, under-stated and traditional. Two years ago, after 50 wins as an amateur jumps jockey, Naylor Leyland broke his neck while steeplechasing. Ever since, he has put his energy into hotels rather than horses. I met him in the drawing room, a place where he is often found chatting to guests or sharing an evening drink. It has an elegant, residential atmosphere; there are oil portraits on the walls, books and newspapers by the fireplace - and, in the adjacent study, an 'honesty bar' where guests serve themselves from a side table. His application of the town house concept is simple. Cut out areas that are costly and often loss-making - restaurants, public bars, lobby facilities and the large staffs that go with them - and you can still provide a wide range of luxury services and accommodation at prices that undercut the large hotels. Single rooms at the Egerton begin at under Pounds 100. On opening my door at the Sloane Hotel, a tiny establishment of just 12 rooms in Chelsea, I first felt somewhat put out. The room beyond was full of lovely antiques, but it seemed slightly small. On one side of the room, though, there was a wooden banister. I moved over to it, and was astonished to find myself gazing down onto a room of enormous height and the grey silk canopy, draperies and tassels of a four-poster bed. Like all the rooms in the Sloane, its Pounds 150 gallery suites offer lavish and surprising design. With its wall tapestries, walnut antiques, silver-backed brushes and crochet-bordered sheets, spending a night there was rather like staying in a grand, highly decorated private country house. But as in all of London's small luxury hotels, the American vision of what an English country house should be - Colefax and Fowler-inspired chintzes, frills and floral patterns  -is conspicuously absent. Like other town house hotel owners, the Sloane's Sue Rogers, an interior decorator, puts the stamp of her individual taste and style on every room, traditional, contemporary or neo-classical. Hidden behind the reception desk at the recently opened Halkin Hotel near Hyde Park Corner lies an office resembling Nasa's mission control. A bewildering display of consols, monitors and computer screens, it is the electronic heart of the most modern, high-tech hotel in London. What in God's name, I wondered, as I peeked at this gadgetry, can the rooms be like? Apart from a fax machine and two telephones on the desk, there was no sign of any silicon-chip wizardry in my Pounds 300 room. The luxury of the large marble bathroom was far more striking. The 41 rooms at the Halkin are of Italian minimalist design: stark lines and empty space are as much responsible for an air of opulence as stylish, Milan-imported furnishings and art pieces. But the high tech was there nonetheless, security-recording room entries, automatically allocating private fax numbers, electronically prioritising butler's room calls and duties. It is all as unobtrusive and professional as the service in the Halkin's Italian-nouvelle Gualtiero Marchesi restaurant. This is a hotel as much for the modern aesthete as the pressured businessman. My favourite little luxury hotel, though, is Blakes in South Kensington, something of an institution among celebrities, fashion and media people in London. Quite simply, it is self-indulgent fun. This is a place where a little fantasising comes easily. Behind the fantasy lies a meticulous attention to detail and decoration. Owner Anouska Hempel blends fabrics, furniture and accessories, and carries individual themes and colours across whole floors of the 50-room hotel. My own Pounds 295 room, in black and gold, positively glowed. Light, bleached floorboards stained with black diamond patterns; black silk walls covered with 36 gilt-framed lithographs; polished Biedermeier furniture; a four-poster bed festooned with masses of fabric - as the hours passed, all conspired to carry me light years from the grey weather and the anonymous city that lay outside my window.

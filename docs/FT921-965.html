			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Businessman proposed as Thai premier A POWERFUL businessman and politician from northern Thailand who was refused entry to the US last year because of alleged links to heroin trafficking was proposed yesterday as the country's new prime minister. Mr Narong Wongwan, a taciturn 66-year-old entrepreneur with interests in tobacco, logging and other agricultural industries, was chosen by a group of five pro-military parties which announced yesterday that they had formed a coalition following the general election on Sunday. The choice of Mr Narong dismayed western embassies and the business community in Bangkok, although Mr Narong said he was proud to be entrusted with the premiership. 'I'll do my best for the country,' he told a news conference. 'I will be decisive and fair in my job.' He brushed aside questions about drugs, and his associates said suggestions that Mr Narong was involved in the trade were unfounded and unfair. Ms Margaret Tutwiler, of the US State Department, confirmed yesterday that Mr Narong had in July last year been denied a visa to the US under section 212 of the US Immigration Act. This section allows the US to deny visas to anyone known or believed to be involved in the illicit trafficking of controlled substances. Mr Narong, a former agriculture minister and leader of two other political parties in the past, now heads the Samakki Tham (Justice Unity) Party, which was created last year with the approval of the armed forces after they overthrew the previous elected government in a coup d'etat. Samakki Tham was established to strengthen the influence of the military in parliamentary politics, and the party won the largest number of seats - 79 - in the election on Sunday. In order to achieve a majority in the 360-seat lower house of parliament, however, Samakki Tham decided to form an alliance with four other parties sympathetic to the military. The coalition is likely to be fragile. Mr Narong, an elected MP, was apparently chosen by the pro-military parties as a compromise candidate in response to opposition among liberals and students to the idea of a non-elected, senior military officer being appointed by the outgoing junta. The choice of Mr Narong puts the supporters of democracy in a quandary. 'The Thai electorate has spoken,' said one western diplomat yesterday. 'If the leader of the largest party becomes prime minister, who are we to object?' Mr Narong has yet to be confirmed by parliament or by King Bhumibol Adulyadej. Mr Samak Sundravej, leader of the Prachakorn Thai (Thai Citizens) Party, another coalition member, said a further two weeks would be needed before the first parliamentary session could be convened. Haggling over cabinet posts may yet upset the coalition and the proposal to install Mr Narong.</p>

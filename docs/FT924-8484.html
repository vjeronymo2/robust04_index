			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Tokyo claims machinery orders are rising A SHARP fall in Japanese private sector investment in new machinery over the last two years is close to bottoming out, government officials suggested yesterday after reporting a 7.9 per cent increase in orders in September. Yet the officials from the Economic Planning Agency warned that private sector orders in the final three months of this year would be 11.2 per cent down on the third quarter. The increase in machinery orders was a welcome relief for Japan's political leadership after a stream of statistics which have shown the economy is still in fragile health. Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, told a meeting of the ruling Liberal Democratic party policymakers that it would not take long before the economy bottomed out. However, a supplementary budget which is central to the implementation of the emergency public spending package announced in August is unlikely to be debated soon by the Japanese Diet (parliament). Mr Kozo Watanabe, minister for international trade and industry, said the supplementary budget would only be debated towards the end of the 40-day extraordinary session of the Diet which began on October 30. Debate on the budget has been held up by the protracted and increasingly intense political power struggle within the LDP and between it and the opposition parties over the Tokyo Sagaw Kyubin bribery scandal. The LDP yesterday moderated its stance in the dispute by agreeing in principle that some of its leaders could be called to give evidence to a parliamentary committee over their role in the affair. However, the three main opposition parties are insisting they will not agree to a detailed timetable for discussing the budget until it is clear which LDP leaders will give evidence and whether they will appear as sworn witnesses. Mr Noboru Takeshita, the highly influential former prime minister, is top of the list of leaders which the opposition wants to question. Despite the delay to the budget, spending on public works is increasingly rapidly. Starts on public construction programmes rose by 41.5 per cent to a record monthly Y2.3bn (Pounds 12.2m) in September, according to the construction ministry. Much of the public works investment in the Y10,700bn package is being financed by the so-called shadow budget, the Fiscal Investment and Loan Programme, which is not subject to detailed scrutiny by parliament.</p>

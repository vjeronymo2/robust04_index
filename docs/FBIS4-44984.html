			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sakina Yusuf Khan: "Scepticism Over Sulaiman </F> Sait's New Secular Party"]    [Text] New Delhi, May 1--The launching of the Indian  National League in New Delhi last week by the former Indian  Union Muslim League (IUML) president, Mr Ibrahim Sulaiman Sait,  is being viewed with scepticism in political circles.    Political observers point out that the emergence of the new  party is the logical culmination of the contradiction within the  IUML which has been persisting for quite some time. Over the  past two years Mr Sait, who had reigned supreme as the IUML  president since 1973, seemed to his party colleagues to be a  leader out of touch with reality.    The Kerala IUML's objection to Mr Sait's approach and  politics have been articulated by the state unit president, Mr  Thangal, from time to time. The split, observers feel, was a  foregone conclusion after Mr Sait's replacement by Mr G.M.  Banatwala as party president in February this year.    Holding the Prime Minister and the Congress responsible for  the demolition of the Babri-masjid, Mr Sait had been insisting  on the withdrawal of the IUML from the Congress-led coalition  government in Kerala.    But IUML MLAs [members of Legislative Assembly] believe that  snapping the alliance would be impolitic as losing the Muslim  support would leave the Congress free to woo the majority  community more aggressively. Besides, they argued why should  they agree to end the marriage of convenience that provided them  control of 65 percent of the state's budget and plum ministries,  including industry and education. But Mr Sait who had little at  stake in the UDF [United Democratic Front] coalition dismissed  them as power-hungry politicians and severed his ties with the  IUML to set up his own party.    In a bid to don the secular mantle, Mr Sait dropped the word  Muslim and chose to name his party Indian National League. The  party's professed aim is to break out of the minority cocoon and  join the secular mainstream and fight the fascist forces gaining  ground in the country.    But there are very few willing to accept Mr Sait's professed  secularism at its face value. Especially in view of the  inaugural charter of demands raised by his party which include  the formation of a ministry of minority affairs at the Centre,  reservations for Muslims in government jobs, dialogue between  the administration and the Kashmiri people for a political  solution, the disciplining of anti-national forces like the RSS  [Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh] (organization of service to the  nation), the inclusion of wakf land and graveyard in the Babri  masjid site and protection of the mosques in Mathura and  Varanasi. These have raised eyebrows in political circles and  already cast a shadow on the nascent organisation's professed  secular aim.    Says Mr Tariq Anwar of the Congress: "If Mr Sait thinks that  he can ensure his political survival by keeping the Ayodhya  issue alive, he is being foolish. The recent assembly elections  in six states have proved that Muslims do not want to submit  their destiny to religious leadership and will not follow their  diktat."    According to Mr Anwar, organisations like the IUML, have  ceased to have any relevance and if a united IUML could not  progress beyond the backwaters of Kerala, to expect its  decimated avatar to make an impact is being plain unrealistic.    While agreeing with Mr Anwar that there is no scope for a  communal party in national politics, the Janata Dal MP [member  of Parliament], Syed Shahabuddin, is not entirely dismissive of  Mr Sait's new outfit. Says Mr Shahabuddin, "In so far as it is  the launching of a secular party I welcome Mr Sait's initiative.  But given his background, Mr Sait will have to prove his secular  credentials to be accepted into the national mainstream which  does not however mean that he has to stop advocating the  legitimate causes of the Muslims. However, we must wait and  watch the party's performance before passing any judgment on it."    A pertinent question being raised by critics is can a party  whose very genesis is based on a religious issue like the Babri  masjid be expected to follow a secular path? Mr Sait counters  the contention vociferously. "The demand for rebuilding of the  Babri masjid is not a religious demand. The demolition was a  severe blow to the secular fabric of the nation. To reduce it to  a Hindu-Muslim issue is mischievous," he says.    As for the other demands, Mr Sait says none of them can  justifiably be called sectarian or communal. For instance, the  Kashmir issue, the demand for reservation for backward sections  of society are national and societal issues and have been raised  by other secular parties as well from time to time. "Then why is  it that when we raise these issues it is branded communal  sectarian demand," he asks.    But as rightly pointed out by Mr Shahabuddin it is not  IUML's  raising these issues but its concentrating only on them in its  inaugural convention which has raised doubts about the parties  secular intentions.    But how does the former IUML patriarch propose to reconcile  the party's professed secular ideals with the conservatism and  fanatical outlook of the fundamentalists, who form the majority  of Mr Sait's following? Mr Sait refutes the fact that the  majority consists of extremists. He cites the overwhelming youth  presence at the party's convention in Delhi last week as  evidence of his support among the younger generation of Muslims  which according to Mr Sait is neither fundamentalist nor  communal.</p>

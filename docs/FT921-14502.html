			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / International Company News: Motorola climbs to Dollars 126m as sales rise by 4% MOTOROLA, the leading US electronics and semi-conductor manufacturer, reported improved fourth-quarter results, buoyed by the performances of its semi-conductor, cellular telephone and paging businesses. Fourth-quarter income rose to Dollars 126m, or 96 cents a share, from Dollars 109m, or 82 cents, in the fourth quarter of 1990, when Motorola suffered an earnings decline. Sales for the quarter rose 4 per cent to Dollars 3.04bn from Dollars 2.93bn in the same period last year. Fourth-quarter results reflected 'sluggish economies in the US and Europe', Mr George Fisher, chairman and chief executive, said. 'This impact should continue to be felt in the first half of 1992 with the potential for modest economic growth in the second half.' Sales for the full year increased 4 per cent to Dollars 11.34bn, from Dollars 10.88bn in 1980. However, earnings declined to Dollars 454m, or Dollars 3.44 per share, from Dollars 499m, or Dollars 3.80, in the previous year. Motorola said sales of its communications products rose two per cent in 1991, against the previous year. Semi-conductor products sales rose 7 per cent. However, the company's computer sales fell 2 per cent and the information products group recorded increased operating losses for the year. The company also recorded losses due to investments in a proposed global communications system called Iridium. Military and government sales fell 8 per cent, despite a significant contract for secure telecommunications equipment from Saudi Arabia. The Automotive and Industrial Electronics group reported an 8 per cent increase in sales.</p>

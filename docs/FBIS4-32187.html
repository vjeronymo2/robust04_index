			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Janos Nemeth, chairman of the National </F> Election Commission, by Gy. Attila Fekete; place and date not  given]    [Text] In an interview with NEPSZABADSAG, Dr. Janos  Nemeth, chairman of the National Election Commission (OVB), has  said that the political parties and their candidates, as well as  independent candidates, would be wise to use the three weeks  between the two rounds of voting to introduce themselves to the  voters and outline their programs to them in detail, instead of  switching to a dirty campaign. According to the OVB chairman,  the role of the electronic media in the campaign has risen since  1990. This explains in part the fact that the number of filed  objections to the programs of Hungarian Television, for  instance, has multiplied in comparison with the number filed  four years ago.    [Fekete] In recent weeks the Supreme Court has reviewed on  appeal several opinions of the OVB. At first the court set  narrowly, and then ever wider, the limits within which the OVB  could condemn violations. Would it not be more expedient if the  OVB could issue not just opinions but also binding orders?    [Nemeth] With due consideration for the provisions of the  law  and the decisions of the Supreme Court, since its establishment  the OVB has been seeking the legal instruments and other means  through which it could express its opinion of conduct described  or presented in various petitions. I know this is difficult to  understand for persons whose background does not include legal  training. The law assigned the OVB the task of safeguarding the  fairness and legality of elections. At the same time, the  legislators failed to give the OVB suitable instruments with  which to enforce the Electoral Law. According to my experience,  however, the very fact that the OVB's proceedings on every  petition are open to the press, and that its opinions regularly  receive full coverage in the press and on radio and television,  is sufficient to deter violators from continuing to break the  rules.    [Fekete] What happens when violators disregard the opinion  of  the OVB? Those who attempted to buy nomination forms have been  arrested.    [Nemeth] Section 34, Paragraph 2 of the Electoral Law  defines  the jurisdiction of the OVB in specific cases. There you do not  find any provision that would enable the OVB to penalize conduct  aimed at "gaining an unlawful advantage," for instance. That,  too, explains why we have never claimed that the Electoral Law,  which is rather sketchy on procedure, is our very best piece of  legislation.    [Fekete] You were OVB chairman also during the 1990  elections. In what respects are the 1990 campaign and the  present one similar, and how do they differ?    [Nemeth] Four years ago the political parties had  substantially less money for campaigning. This is evident also  from the substantial increase in political advertisements in  public places, in the press, and also on radio and television.  In comparison with the 1990 campaign, the role of the electronic  media has risen. It is no accident that the OVB has received  substantially more complaints, objections, and notifications  concerning Hungarian Radio and especially Hungarian Television.    [Fekete] What objections did the notifications contain?    [Nemeth] One group of notifications protested that Hungarian  Television had refused to broadcast one or another political  party's election program. But another group of notifications was  not critical specifically of the election programs. In  conjunction with the increased number of complaints against  Hungarian Television, however, one must also realize that the  country itself has become more politicized. People very often  believe to perceive political overtones even in programs that  have no political message whatever. On the whole, it seems to  me, there was less rudeness in this election campaign than had  been expected.    [Fekete] But most of the complaints critical of Hungarian  Television's programs must have had some foundation. After all,  the OVB recently called on Hungarian Television, Hungarian  Radio, and the Hungarian News Agency to observe the provisions  of the Electoral Law, and it warned them that the principles of  fairness and impartiality must not be violated even in programs  not related to the elections. Could you explain this somewhat  Dodonian opinion?    [Nemeth] The Electoral Law specifies what the public service  media are required to do during an election campaign, what kind  of programs and announcements they are obliged to broadcast.  Except in the case of election programs, however, the law  contains no provisions regarding the conduct of Hungarian  Television, Hungarian Radio, and the Hungarian News Agency. We  drafted our exhortative opinion, for impartiality and fairness  in the elections, on the basis of Section 26 of the Electoral  Law.    [Fekete] For Hungarian Television, what would be the  consequences of failure to change its programming policies,  despite the OVB's warning?    [Nemeth] The OVB has no authority to impose a penalty on  Hungarian Television. Should Hungarian Television's programs  fail to conform to the OVB's opinion in the future as well, the  political parties or voters could claim a violation.    [Fekete] Four years ago the campaign really degenerated only  in the second round.    [Nemeth] I sincerely hope that will not be the case in 1994.  The parties and their candidates, as well as independent  candidates, would be wise to use the three weeks between the two  rounds of voting to outline their programs in greater detail  instead of discrediting each other. The voters will punish any  candidate who conducts a dirty campaign.    [Fekete] Much of the time during the OVB's sessions is spent  arguing whether the question that happens to be on the agenda is  or is not within the commission's jurisdiction. Why is that?    [Nemeth] It would be unfair of me to blame everything on the  Electoral Law's shortcomings. Parliament elected four members  and the secretary of the OVB, and 15 members have been delegated  by political parties running national lists. Some of the  disputes stem from the political parties' contrasting interests.  Naturally, it would be better if the OVB were following legally  correct rules of procedure--say, rules contained in the  Electoral Law itself.    [Fekete] Has it never occurred to the OVB to propose  amending  the Electoral Law and to draft a bill on electoral procedures?  After all, the Electoral Law now in force has simply proved to  be bad.    [Nemeth] I am unable to fully agree with your last comment.  In my opinion, the Electoral Law's substantive provisions are  not bad. It is the law's procedural part that has been left  unfinished and is causing countless problems. The OVB does not  have authority to draft legislative bills, and no one has  requested it to do so. Of course, if the Interior Ministry or  the Justice Ministry were to begin work on amending or further  amending the new or amended Electoral Law, the OVB would gladly  share its experience with the authorities concerned.</p>

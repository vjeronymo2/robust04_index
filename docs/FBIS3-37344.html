			<p>Language: <F P=105> Latvian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Latvian Prime Minister Birkavs told journalists  today that Latvia will actively--dependent on financial  possibilities-- start cooperating within the framework of the  NATO Partnership for Peace program. Birkavs comments came  following his return from Brussels. On Monday in Brussels,  Birkavs confirmed with his signature Latvia's agreement to the  new NATO program.    Latvia will initially participate in the formation of a  Baltic peacekeeping battalion, arranging its military structures  so they correspond with NATO standards. Moreover, Latvia will  try to use all the information received from the NATO, as well  as taking part in NATO exercises and various educational  seminars.</p>

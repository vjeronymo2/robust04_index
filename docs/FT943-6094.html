			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): Britain's grain harvest lower but good in parts - Unfavourable weather has hit yields in some parts of the country, though quality is up to standard In 35 years of farming I can remember only three occasions when we have finished the harvest before the end of August - and this year is the third. It was achieved by working over most of the bank holiday weekend. If I am totally honest I should admit that we have not quite finished, there are still a few beans to do as well as a couple of fields of linseed grown for industrial use on set-a-side land. But all the wheat is in the barn. That represents the main harvest on this farm, so we feel we can relax a little. As I forecast in this column a few times, yields were down on last year, although not as drastically as I once feared. The appallingly wet conditions into which many of the wheat crops were planted last autumn, followed by still more unwelcome rain in the spring and then a heatwave in July, were hardly the best mix of weather for heavy yields. But as I drove the combine harvester during the regular drivers' meal breaks, I was pleased to note that some of the patches that were flooded for much of the winter had recovered quite well. Only the crops planted after sugar beet into near-impossibly muddy conditions were really thin. In the event, I estimate, in advance of putting the crop over a weighbridge, that we have harvested between half and three quarters of a tonne less wheat per acre than last year to average about three and a quarter tonnes. It could have been so much worse. I am told by farming friends in other parts of the country that this drop in yield is by no means universal. In the south and west of England most wheat yields have been as good or better than last year. The most disappointing crops have been in the east, where I farm, and the north, although there is still a considerable acreage to harvest in the north and Scotland so it is perhaps too soon to make a definitive judgment on the size of the national crop. It is fairly clear, however, that all over the UK the quality of the grain is generally good and well up to European Union, and therefore merchants', required standards. This applies to both berry size and weight although, in the case of milling wheat, protein content and baking quality are somewhat variable. More satisfying is the price which is probably more than Pounds 10 a tonne (10 per cent to 12 per cent) more than most UK farmers budgeted last year. There are a number of reasons for this. The continuing devaluation of sterling against other EU currencies has, through the green monetary system, raised the UK intervention price for common (milling) wheat and that has created a firm base for all wheat, including that grown for feed and even that sold for delivery before intervention starts in November. Higher than expected grain prices are not confined to the UK, however. All over Europe they are above budget. This can only be because perceived shortage compared with expected demand across the community as a result of a combination of set-a-side, below average yields and the likely requirements of third countries. But high grain prices add to the problems of the already stretched intensive livestock sector by raising the cost of animal feed. To try to reduce this burden the European Commission, a few days ago, increased the volume of grain on EU markets by releasing 1.6m tonnes from the 14m it held in intervention stores. Prices dropped a couple of pounds a tonne as a result but only for a few days and have since bounced back almost to where they were before the release. The trade obviously believes the shortage is real for the time being. Meanwhile, according to the International Wheat Council, world wheat production is expected to be down by 23m tonnes this year as a result of reductions in output in several northern hemisphere countries and declining prospects in Australia. So, as I steered the combine harvester round our final field of wheat last weekend, I reflected how times had changed. It seemed only yesterday that we farmers were being accused of producing grain that nobody wanted. 'Put your farms down to trees and theme parks,' the critics had said. 'We don't need you any more.' And most of us in the UK responded by reluctantly accepting the EU's shilling to set aside 15 to 18 per cent of our land. Is that policy already out of date? Is it time to bring that land back to cultivation? Can we rely on the politicians, who usually take years to make a decision, to react fast enough to avoid a major world grain shortage?</p>

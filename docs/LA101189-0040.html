			<p><P> October 11, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 3-YEAR OLD CALLS 911, SAVES CHOKING MOTHER  </P> <P> When his mother began choking on a lozenge in their Van Nuys condominium  Tuesday, 3-year-old Jameson Rodgers knew exactly what to do. He called 911,  just as his parents had trained him.  </P> <P> "My mom's on the floor. She can't breathe," he told a Los Angeles Fire  Department dispatcher in a calm and articulate voice.  </P> <P> Minutes later, three paramedics arrived from a station only a third of a mile  away and found Peggy Rodgers on her hands and knees, on the verge of becoming  unconscious. They dislodged the lozenge stuck in her throat, authorities said.  She did not need to be hospitalized.  </P> <P> Jameson's parents said they taught him how to call 911 about a year and a half  ago when the mother was in the midst of a difficult pregnancy. They placed the  phone within easy reach and had him practice making the call with the phone  line unhooked, said his father, Michael Rodgers -- son of country-pop singer  Jimmie S. Rodgers.  </P> <P> "I didn't realize he had called 911 till I heard sirens," the mother told a  news conference that fire officials called to honor the boy. "He kept saying,  'It's OK, mom. They're on their way, they're on their way.' "  </P></p>

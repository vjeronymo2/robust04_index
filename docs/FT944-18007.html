			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: European salmon farmers set for a bumper year This will be the most profitable year for salmon farming in northern Europe for some time, confounding the predictions of many industry experts, according to a Norwegian salmon industry executive. Mr Jostein Refsnes, executive vice-president of Hydro Seafood, a large salmon producer in Norway and Scotland, attributed the upturn to a yield boost at existing farms thanks to improved methods and better disease control. This was combined with a rise in demand in Europe and the Far East in response to competitive prices and better marketing, notably by the Scots, he told the annual Scottish fish farming conference in Aviemore, Scotland. The optimistic picture painted by Mr Refsnes contrasts with the gloomy one drawn earlier this year by Scottish salmon farmers. In February they urged the European Union to investigate allegedly unfair subsidies given to Norwegian farmers, which caused over-production and drove prices down. Since then the Scottish farmers' relations with the Norwegians have improved and they have benefited from the factors listed by Mr Refsnes. Farms can now make a profit even though prices have not increased much in real terms. Mr Refsnes said the Far Eastern market for Norwegian salmon had grown by 68 per cent this year, while that in Europe was up by 23 per cent. Scottish attempts to hinder the free flow of Norwegian salmon into the EU had not succeeded. The Scottish salmon growers association says UK demand has risen 26 per cent rise this year. Output is expected to reach 59,000 tonnes, up from 45,000 tonnes in 1993. Norway is expected to produce 220,000 tonnes and Mr Refsnes expected the gap in output between the two countries to widen. Mr Refsnes criticised the idea, strongly advocated by Scottish farmers, of establishing producer organisations to control output and sustain prices. That, he said, would slow the development of the industry into larger units and allow the inefficient to survive.</p>

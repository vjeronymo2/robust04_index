Karayev; UDC 519.25] </F>   [Abstract] The proliferation of ship-borne and coastal  radar (RLS) used at very low grazing angles resulting is surface  shadowing in addition to space and airborne radar operating at  medium and small angles of incidence and the shortcomings of  existing approaches of solving the problem of echo signal  spectrum at small grazing angles prompted the development of a  new approach which is suitable for finding any statistical  characteristic of a random moving surface allowing for blockage.  The approach is first tested on a simple model and then applied  to the case of sea waves. The approach thus makes it possible to  treat the undulating sea surface as a superposition of traveling  plane waves with random amplitudes and determine its effective  statistical characteristics. Since available computer facilities  are too slow and inadequate for parallel calculations, the new  approach is based on taking blockage into account for each term,  than adding up the results. The proposed algorithm is a  combination of precise and approximate approaches and makes it  possible to consider moving surfaces and find any statistical  characteristic allowing for blockage as well as plot the  distribution function, resulting in a precise solution. It is  expected that the algorithm will be used to find the spectrum of  the echo from the sea surface at small grazing angles. The  author is grateful to M.B. Kanevskiy for constructive  discussions. Figures 5; references 11: 10 Russian, 1 Western.</p>

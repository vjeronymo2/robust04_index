			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / International Company News: Salomon Bros strengthens US equity operations SALOMON Brothers, the New York investment bank recovering from last year's Treasury bond auction scandal, yesterday moved to strengthen its battered US equity operation with the appointment of Mr Rodney Berens as co-head of the department. Mr Berens, 47, formerly in charge of global research at Morgan Stanley, will share responsibility for the department with its existing head, Mr Bruce Hackett, and like him will join the executive committee which runs the securities firm. Mr Berens left Morgan Stanley last year for private business. Salomon's equity department suffered a substantial number of resignations late last year and early this as the group implemented a wide-ranging shake-up of its management practices in the wake of the scandal. This led to a widespread belief on Wall Street - strongly denied by Salomon  -that the firm was scaling back its commitment to equities.</p>

			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Indonesian police arrest leading labour activists Indonesian police have detained two leading labour activists and summoned a third in an apparent crackdown linked to riots which swept Medan city in April, Reuter reports from Jakarta. Diplomats said the moves, which included interrogating Mr Muchtar Pakpahan, a labour leader, may be part of a wider effort to discredit Indonesia's nascent labour movement by linking it with growing unrest directed at the ethnic Chinese minority. Labour rallies in Medan in April were the climax of growing worker unrest in economically vibrant Indonesia.</p>

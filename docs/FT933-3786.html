			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Trials show water meters may cut consumption by up to 11% HOUSEHOLD meters could cut water use by some 11 per cent in England and Wales, according to a long-awaited report by the government and the water industry, to be published on Monday. The findings, based on three years of trials, will fuel the growing debate about whether people who use a lot of water should pay more. Most households pay a flat annual fee based on property value under the old rating system. Many businesses have been metered for years. The results of the 12 regional trials will be welcomed by Ofwat and the National Rivers Authority, the industry regulators. They have feared that recurrent water shortages in the south of England would force companies to build new reservoirs and raise customers' bills. The industry's response is likely to be mixed. Anglian Water and Cambridge Water have already announced compulsory metering to curb water use. But many water companies, including some in the south, were sceptical that metering would be worth the high cost - industry estimates suggest Pounds 3bn for England and Wales. 'Metering might delay the need for new reservoirs, but not forever,' one said. The report says to install a meter typically cost Pounds 165 inside a home and Pounds 200 outside. The cost of fitting free meters in the smaller 11 trials ran to several million pounds, split between the environment department and water companies. In the Isle of Wight, the 50,000 households surveyed reduced their water use by some 21 per cent after meters were installed. But in the Hotwells district of Bristol Water, where some 850 households were tested, the drop was only some 2 per cent. Many water executives yesterday questioned whether these falls in demand would be permanent. One said: 'The Isle of Wight trial took place over only three years, during recession and during the worst drought for decades - it is hard to separate the metering effects from other exhortations to use less water.'</p>

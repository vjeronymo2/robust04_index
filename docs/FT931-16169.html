			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / Arts: Korea squashed into a corridor - Susan Moore visits the Samsung Gallery The V&amp;A's new Korean art gallery is little short of a slap in the face for the culture it seeks to celebrate. First, the 'gallery' - a glorious misnomer for what is, a section of corridor previously occupied by part of the sculpture collection. This is the nub of the problem. The gallery is heralded as 'the first permanent, comprehensive display in Korean art in Britain', reflecting some 1500 years of Korean art and craft. What we find are some 200 objects of wildly fluctuating quality presented in a hotch-potch display. Is this crowd of exhibits, squeezed into a corridor as if an embarrassing postscript to the Far Eastern collection, a fair representation of the achievement and culture of the Korean people? I think not. A new Korean gallery was not at the top of the list of the museum's priorities. It has an important but smallish collection of some 600 items, notably ceramics, built up ad hoc after 1878. During the state visit to Britain of the Korean President and his wife in 1989, the First Lady Kim Ok-sook was disappointed by the low profile of Korean art in Britain and asked whether the V&amp;A would be interested in a Korean gallery. Soon after, the Korean conglomerate Samsung came forward to offer the museum Pounds 430,000 for the project. Looking around the Samsung Gallery of Korean Art, it is difficult to see how the sponsor's money was spent. Rather than allowing the strengths - and weaknesses - of the museum's holdings to determine the nature of the display, the curators opted instead for the bold historical sweep regardless of the lack of appropriate material with which to flesh it out. Take the ceramics, which line the right wall of the corridor. The first case, which claims to display Korean pottery 300-900 AD, fails to do justice to the abundance, diversity of shapes and skill of the Silla potters and makes for an unpromising introduction. While the collection does have some fine examples of 18th century white porcelain with underglaze red decoration, these are outnumbered by a clumsy arrangement of large blue and white porcelain, grey and deformed. Equally misleading are the displays of furniture, textiles and metalwork on the left flank of the corridor. The collection has been arbitrarily ordered into themes in the spirit of the TT Tsui Chinese Gallery, where works of art are presented as documents of social history. In the shallow space of 'The Man's Room', for example, we find a carved slate funerary epitaph to a 17th century official which would probably have been made for display in an ancestral shrine. Similarly, alongside objects made for the scholar's desk such as elegant porcelain and inlaid metal brush pots, we find a small bronze incense burner that, far from being an object of everyday life, was used in Korea for ceremonies, either in a Buddhist monastery or for ancestor worship. A kind of eternal Korea is presented: there is no sense of chronology or evolution. Some objects are contemporary, others may be 16th century. The cases are sprinkled with objects that strike even the untutored eye as third-rate - a Choson lacquer table inlaid with mother-of-pearl; hunting and flower screens; and a garish contemporary flower painting made by a Buddhist monk. A glance at their inventory numbers reveals them to be the fruits of last-minute shopping expeditions to stop the gaps. The inexplicable absence of any Korean art specialist from the gallery advisory committee is only too apparent. It would be wrong to suggest that the gallery did not contain rare and exceptional works of art. There is the arresting Choson jar bearing a boldly gestural lotus flower in underglazed red. Another of the collection's treasures is a Koryo dynasty bronze vase of 1100-1300 AD, subtly inlaid in silver wire with delicate willows and waterfowl. The inlaid Koryo celadons are peculiar to Korea, as are the brightly painted ox-horn caskets from the late Choson period. By not being sufficiently selective the Far Eastern department does a grave disservice to its public. It is worth contrasting the V&amp;A experience - complete with unhelpful silent videos and an object we are invited to touch, a completely smooth blue and white dragon jar - with the spectacular new Hotung Gallery of Oriental Antiquities at the British Museum, and the Fitzwilliam's installation of the outstanding Gompertz collection of Korean ceramics. (The spacious Fitzwilliam gallery was created in 1990 for less than Pounds 60,000.) Both galleries reveal a respect and a feeling for works of art which are lacking in these cluttered shop-window displays. Here, individual objects do not have the breathing space to be properly viewed or to speak for themselves. The quiet, understated quality of so much Korean art does not profit from busy neighbours. Thanks to the peculiar serenity of the Gompertz Koryo celadons - combinations of simplicity of shape, sparse decoration and perfect, luminous glazes - the effect of the Fitzwilliam gallery is overwhelming. The visitor goes away determined to find out more. Faced with the Samsung Gallery, the visitor could be forgiven for walking away unmoved and little the wiser.</p>

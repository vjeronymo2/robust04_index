			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / Construction Contracts: Maintaining military installations The BALFOUR BEATTY PROJECTS &amp; ENGINEERING company has been awarded a Pounds 33m contract by the Ministry of Defence for works services management for the entire MoD estate and installations in Gibraltar. The Royal Navy, Army and Royal Air Force installations form an important operational and logistic base in support of Nato's southern flank. The contract is a major achievement as Balfour Beatty Projects &amp; Engineering is believed to be the first works services manager appointed for an overseas Ministry of Defence base. Gibraltar has been a British base since 1704. As works services manager, Balfour Beatty Projects &amp; Engineering will be responsible for managing the annual maintenance and minor new works budget of about Pounds 10m per annum. The works services manager contract is initially for three years and Balfour Beatty Projects &amp; Engineering will be responsible for the facilities in Gibraltar from June 1993 after a three month hand-over period.</p>

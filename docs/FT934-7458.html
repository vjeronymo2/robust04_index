			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Losses at 600 rise to Pounds 1.6m With no sign of a recovery in the European capital goods market, pre-tax losses at 600 Group, the engineering equipment manufacturer, increased from Pounds 240,000, adjusted for FRS 3, to Pounds 1.59m for the six months to September 30. Turnover fell to Pounds 44.9m (Pounds 49.4m). Prof Michael Wright, chairman, said it was due to a downturn in the European machine tool market, particularly in Germany, and a further deterioration in the construction related mechanical handling market in the UK. The shares fell 6p to 36p. The result was helped by a Pounds 1.3m (Pounds 846,000) credit from the actuarial valuation of its UK pension scheme. Prof Wright said that despite significant progress in rationalising and restructuring the results remained disappointing. Losses per share were 3.8p (1.3p). The dividend is halved at 0.5p.</p>

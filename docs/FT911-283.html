			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / Downing Street quiet on what Sir Robin Butler saw THE tight-lipped world of Downing Street news management was itself under close scrutiny yesterday when it emerged that Sir Bernard Ingham, for 11 years Mrs Margaret Thatcher's press overlord, had found himself victim of the censor's blue pencil. Infamous for his non-attributable quotability, Sir Bernard's autobiography has undergone some selective and, most probably, financially damaging editing by the sensation-shy Cabinet Office. The memoirs, entitled Kill the Messenger, have been long-awaited for revelations on the more controversial moments of the Thatcher years. Not least, pundits were anxious to read an account of the Westland helicopter affair in 1985-86 which led to the resignation of Mr Michael Heseltine as defence secretary. Under the so-called Radcliffe rules, however, civil servants and ministers must submit their drafts to the Cabinet Office. The Sunday Times, ru-moured to have paid a six-figure sum for the serial rights, yesterday had to make the best of having Sir Robin Butler, Britain's chief home civil servant, as its unpaid editor. While carrying an officially abridged version it tried to make good the damage with a front page report of what Sir Robin saw. Deletions included passages criticising Mr Heseltine's judgment and others on Mrs Thatcher's often stormy dealings with European partners and Sir Geoffrey Howe, her deputy prime minister. On the key question of whether Downing Street or the Department of Trade and Industry leaked the memorandum from the then solicitor general which was critical of Mr Heseltine, Sir Bernard was allowed to go on the record with his plea of innocence. Downing Street yesterday was characteristically taciturn about whether The Sunday Times would be hauled over the coals for its revelations - as, it pointed out, it was unclear whether or not they were revelations. Its classic reply: 'We don't answer hypothetical questions,' was a well-known formula of Sir Bernard's, who was yesterday understood to be unavailable for comment.</p>

			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / The Lex Column: France The French stock market has never liked Mrs Edith Cresson, so it is not surprising that equity prices have tended to rise as rumours of her resignation gathered pace this week. There is no change in the economic fundamentals, however, which are not encouraging. The National Accounts Committee trimmed its 1992 economic growth forecast to 2 per cent yesterday from 2.2 per cent, and even the new figure looks optimistic. Slower growth is pushing up the budget deficit, though it is still well within the Maastricht limits. The market expectation is that Mr Pierre Beregovoy will take over from Mrs Cresson if and when she goes. He is trusted with the defence of the franc, and there would be less risk of exchange market nervousness forcing an increase in short-term interest rates. But the problem for France, as for other ERM members, is that it now looks likely that German rates will stay high for the rest of the year. Even though French inflation is now nearly two percentage points lower than that of Germany, there is little scope for undercutting German interest rates, as last year's painful experiment showed. Nor is realignment the answer, if Mr Beregovoy would ever permit it. The experience of 1987 showed it actually led to higher interest rates. Recovery, as elsewhere in Europe, thus looks as though it will be deferred. Set in that context, any post-Cresson rally on the bourse could be short lived. The CAC index has already outperformed the Dow by nearly 8 per cent this year. There is no reason for any further outperformance.</p>

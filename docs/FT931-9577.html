			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / Ruhe faces battle for political life: Kohl humiliates minister after attack on DM860m German defence cuts MR VOLKER Ruhe, the German defence minister once regarded as a likely heir apparent to Chancellor Helmut Kohl, appears to be fighting for his political life in a bitter battle over cuts in the defence budget. Twice in the past week Mr Ruhe has been publicly humiliated by Mr Kohl after he attacked a government decision to order new spending cuts of more than DM860m in his DM50bn budget and to consider further cuts in troop strength. First he was rebuked in an official statement from the Chancellor's office, which rejected his accusation that he was facing 'the dictatorship of the finance minister', Mr Theo Waigel. Mr Kohl said the defence cuts were agreed by the whole cabinet. Then he was left sitting outside a meeting of the coalition leadership in Mr Kohl's office for more than an hour, only to be abruptly told there was no time left to discuss the defence cuts. After he went home they discussed the cuts after all. Mr Ruhe, who last year won popular acclaim for attempting to pull out of the European Fighter Aircraft (EFA) project, only to be forced to retreat in the face of furious opposition from the German defence lobby and the British government, has made no secret of his fury at the latest round of cuts. Although he launched himself as defence minister last year on the promise of delivering the 'peace dividend' to the German taxpayer, he now believes the cuts have gone too far. When Mr Kohl announced last weekend at the Munich security conference that he had ordered a new review of numbers in the Bundeswehr, beyond the current target of 370,000 men by 1995, Mr Ruhe sat in silence, looking set to explode. That night, he appeared on Bavarian television to charge Mr Waigel (and by implication, Mr Kohl) with high-handed dictatorship. At stake is a drastic increase in the savings being demanded from this year's budget, as part of the government's consolidation programme to finance spending in east Germany. Originally set at DM300m, the sum was suddenly raised to DM863m in order to scrap a politically unpopular move to means test children's allowances. Last week Mr Ruhe announced an immediate freeze on all new defence contracts, and the cancellation of plans to buy a DM3bn aerial reconnaissance system from the US. 'I was merely saving money I did not have in the first place,' he said later. 'It certainly will not mean there is any extra money for the Eurofighter.' Mr Ruhe was promoted to the Cabinet last April after the resignation of Mr Gerhard Stoltenberg. He was previously secretary-general of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), Mr Kohl's party, and long seen as key figure in the new generation of party leaders. Lacking a strong grassroots base of his own - he comes from Hamburg, where the local CDU organisation is weak - Mr Ruhe has traditionally relied on Mr Kohl's personal support and his own considerable political wits.</p>

			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: HE CAN HONESTLY SAY HE'S WORTH A MILLION  </P> <P> Dwayne Schintzius, a junior at the University of Florida, can sleep nights now  that he has insured his future -- even if he doesn't have one in the National  Basketball Assn.  </P> <P> The 7-foot 2-inch center recently took out a $1-million insurance policy with  Lloyd's of London for protection in case he is injured before he gets a chance  to play professionally.  </P> <P> "From now until I turn pro, if I can't pass an NBA physical, I get a million  dollars," Schintzius said.  </P> <P> Schintzius' policy makes life easier on the Florida basketball program, too,  because it increases the likelihood that he will return to Florida next year.  </P> <P> However, Linda Schintzius, Dwayne's mother, said he was planning to remain at  Florida regardless so he could play with his brother Travis, a high school  senior who signed a letter of intent to play at Florida next season.  </P> <P> The younger Schintzius has yet to contact Lloyd's.  </P> <P> The Associated Press interviewed 36 members of its All-American football team  in the wake of the recent debate over the merits of the National Collegiate  Athletic Assn. requirements for scholarship athletes.  </P> <P> The survey showed that good players and good grades go together, and some of  the athletes explained the reasons, or in some cases, the motivation  responsible for that finding:  </P> <P>  -- Oklahoma's Tony Phillips: "On the average I think most of your better  football players are the more intelligent ones. Sometimes you can make up for a  lack of talent with intelligence."  </P> <P>  -- Arkansas' Kendall Trainor: "Coach (Ken) Hatfield knows if you don't go to  class. Sometimes I think he has people following us around. And if you miss a  class, you have to do a series of 300-yard runs at 6:30 a.m. called the  Razorback Reminder."  </P> <P>  -- Washington State's Mike Utley: "I probably would have been a manual laborer  if it hadn't been for football, but now I'll get a degree."  </P> <P>  -- Alabama's Derrick Thomas: "I will graduate, and football was my ticket."  </P> <P> Donald Trump may be new to boating, but when faced with registering his new  luxury yacht, the Trump Princess, he wasn't too hard-pressed to figure a way  around the 6% sales tax on the $29-million price tag.  </P> <P> Trump formed an out-of-state corporation to buy the yacht, closed the sale in  London, took possession of the vessel in international waters off the coast of  France and painted "Bahamas" on the stern.  </P> <P> This didn't sit well with New Jersey tax agents, who sued for a $1.74-million  "use tax" because the ship is used mainly in New Jersey waters.  </P> <P> Trump, however, got around the use tax, saying that the Trump Princess is used  for promotional purposes and therefore New Jersey can tax only the $400,000  lease payments.  </P> <P> Only three people showed up last week at a golf course in Grand Island, Neb.,  to play in the "First Annual Groundhog Day Golf Tournament," and for good  reason.  </P> <P> The temperature was 2 below zero and the wind-chill factor made it feel like 46  below.  </P> <P> "We had to use the golf clubs as a hammer to drive in the tees," Steve  Rasmussen said. Golf balls froze, plastic in the bottom of two golf bags broke  out when clubs were dropped, "and the frozen greens were fast," Rasmussen said.  </P> <P> "The golf balls became crystallized about the 18th hole," he said. "The shock  on the elbows was about like hitting a rock with a baseball bat. We actually  thought the balls were going to explode."  </P> <P> Just being frank: Boxer Frank Bruno, on his chances of beating Mike Tyson for  the heavyweight title Feb. 25 in Las Vegas:  </P> <P> "This is a peak time to beat Mike Tyson," Bruno said, referring to Tyson's  marital and managerial problems in recent months. "What he is going through --  I don't think his mind is 100% on the job."  </P> <P> Tyson's response: "After the fight you ask Frank Bruno whether it was such a  peak time."  </P> <P> Quotebook  </P> <P> Louisville center Pervis Ellison, after being injured recently in a game  against Ohio State: "I could just see dollar bills flying away. I guess that's  why I couldn't say anything."  </P></p>

			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Most large chains to sell lottery tickets Camelot, the consortium which will launch the UK's national lottery on November 19, has signed up most of the leading retail chains for its initial network of 10,000 outlets where tickets will be sold. The list includes branches of Tesco, J. Sainsbury, Safeway, WH Smith, Menzies, Woolworth and the Co-op. Two of the missing names, Boots and Marks and Spencer, did not want to get involved. Esso and Shell garages will also have the computer terminals that issue and validate lottery tickets. The tickets are expected to cost Pounds 1. At least 55 per cent of the first 10,000 retailers will be independently owned outlets, including grocers, newsagents, off-licences and post offices. Mr Norman Hawkins, Camelot's commercial director, said yesterday: 'We are confident that the retail outlets which form our launch network will enable more than 80 per cent of the adult population in the UK to be within easy distance of a lottery outlet at home or at work.' The aim is to have more than 40,000 retail outlets by the end of 1996, with the percentage of independents rising to 65 per cent. The jackpot prize for the first live draw on BBC 1 on November 19 could be as much as Pounds 2m. Larger top prizes are likely to follow when ticket sales grow. Camelot brings together the food and drinks group Cadbury Schweppes, computer company ICL, the security printer De La Rue, Racal Electronics and GTech, the US company which manufactures lottery equipment and runs lotteries. The consortium said it had put a great deal of effort into selecting its outlets, which had to be in prime locations with at least 500 customers a day and long opening hours. Retailers and their staff also had to be willing to take part in detailed training programmes. Camelot expects to sign a three-year television deal with the BBC later this week. The Office of the National Lottery is set to confirm the details by the end of next week. The weekly programmes are expected to run for about 30 minutes and the BBC is likely to make the programmes in-house rather than using an independent producer. If the lottery has revenues of more than Pounds 3.5bn a year - which is thought possible - five good causes will get between 31.35 per cent and 34 per cent. During the period of the licence, which runs to 2001, the good causes - arts, charities, a millennium fund, the national heritage and sport  -could get a total of Pounds 9bn. Camelot said yesterday that all aspects of the complex operation were on schedule for the November launch. Scratchcard games will be launched next year to back up the main lottery.</p>

			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / US presses for Serbian oil embargo THE US last night pressed for an immediate oil embargo against Serbia as part of a tough package of United Nations sanctions aimed at stopping the ethnic conflict in the breakaway Yugoslav republics. A State Department official said Britain, France and Belgium had agreed to go along with the harder line against Serbia, dropping their proposals to put off an oil embargo to the second stage of a sanctions programme. But the US now had to win over other members of the 15-nation UN Security Council, notably China and Russia. China has already made plain it objects to sanctions and Russia opposes an oil embargo, but neither is expected to block action by using its veto - an extreme step now out of favour at the UN. Western nations were hoping the Security Council would pass a sanctions resolution today. But the tougher US intervention could delay agreement because of more difficult negotiations. The US bid to sharpen international action against Serbia came as Serb irregular forces last night fired further barrages of rockets and artillery shells on Sarajevo, the besieged capital of the breakaway republic of Bosnia-Hercegovina. The missiles came from Serb positions in the wooded hills ringing the city. Earlier, there was a lull in the fighting around Sarajevo after heavy overnight clashes. In a bid to distance itself from Wednesday's mortar attack on Sarajevo which left 17 dead and 80 wounded, the rump Yugoslav presidency called on the UN to investigate the 'massacre'. A European Community suggestion that UN troops should provide protection for humanitarian aid efforts in Bosnia-Hercegovina was rejected by Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general. While acknowledging it was for the Security Council to make a final decision, Mr Boutros Ghali warned that it would require large numbers of UN troops to secure several hundred miles of roads and to establish a defensive perimeter around Sarajevo. The city has been cut off by Serb militia and Yugoslav federal army troops in a bid to starve it into submission. Mr John Major, on his visit to Budapest, said UN sanctions were likely to include a trade embargo, a freeze on Serbia's overseas assets, severe restrictions on commercial flights, the suspension of all official sporting contacts and the break-off of scientific, technical and cultural co-operation. Under EC proposals, there was to be provision for an oil embargo from the middle of next month if Serbia did not act to halt the fighting. The prime minister said the precise terms of the resolution were still under discussion. 'But I hope it will be agreed by the United Nations by the end of this week . . . that it will be a binding and mandatory series of sanctions.' In Belgrade the Serbian Orthodox Church attacked the policies of President Slobodan Milosevic in an unprecedented open letter. The church, which had supported the nationalist politics of Mr Milosevic, yesterday appealed for his resignation and the formation of a government of national salvation. Serbia's state-controlled media censored the memorandum. Greek exports' new road, Page 3</p>

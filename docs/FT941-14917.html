			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Many hands light on work - Chris Tighe canvasses the jobless on training schemes Training schemes? They're crap.' Darren Chow, 25, unemployed, father of one baby with another due in March, is a scheme veteran: he has been on five since leaving school with two CSEs but has never had a 'proper job'. 'At the end of the training, I just got hoyed (thrown) back on the dole. They don't get you into work.' Benwell, the area of Newcastle in which Chow lives, once housed thousands of families whose male breadwinners worked at the vast Vickers engineering complex and other heavy industrial works along the River Tyne. Today, Vickers remains but, like most of the new workplaces along the river, it now employs not masses of labourers but a highly trained, skilled elite. Chow has picked up Youth Training qualifications as a painter and decorator, a City and Guilds in catering from a year at college and a criminal record - 14 months in prison for attacking an inspector on Tyneside's Metro network. This month he starts at a Job Club, a government-sponsored initiative to help the unemployed find work. If it proves fruitless, he plans to return to college for more catering training. 'I've kept out of trouble for two and half years; I can't afford to get into trouble now with my children,' he says. 'I'd be a better lad today if I'd got a job.' Along the road, brothers Trevor and Phillip Donnelly, 22 and 23, are walking home from the Netto discount supermarket. 'I've been on two YTs and three ETs (employment training schemes) and I still haven't got a job,' says Trevor. 'The first YT was at a butchery. They had us sweeping floors. It was rubbish. It was six months before they'd let you scrub the blocks.' His latest scheme gave him forklift truck-driving experience, but no job. He has been on the dole a year. 'I might take another scheme just to get out of the house.' Phillip, jobless for nine months, has had one proper job - a short-term contract as a hospital domestic. His mother fixed that up. A hospital cleaner, she is the only one in the family of seven working. Neither Trevor nor Phillip has ever been in trouble. 'I just sit in the house, play the guitar,' says Phillip. 'You just get sick, bored.' After surviving on Pounds 69 each a fortnight, they would be happy to earn Pounds 100 a week. 'I'm not asking for wads of money,' says Trevor. Disillusion with training schemes is widespread. But Newcastle's West End offers a scheme giving real prospects of work for unskilled men. The government-funded Newcastle City Challenge urban regeneration initiative has employed Larry Watt, an experienced construction project manager, to persuade companies to which it awards building contracts to recruit local people to work on site. His job is not easy; many contractors believe trainees lack skills. But Watt is dogged, and the West End trainees he offers do have skills: they have attended a Tyneside scheme run by Jarvis, the construction company, which offers 39 weeks of concentrated training, including site experience, in bricklaying or joinery, and a National Vocational Qualification. So far 50 West End men have taken up this scheme. Half are now employed and the rest are still in training with Jarvis. For some such as 29-year-old Steven Wilson, now on site placement and about to hear whether the contractor is to employ him, it has helped surmount a history of school truancy, patchy employment and a criminal record. For others like Robert Oxley, 25, employed by a contractor improving the West End estate where he lives, it has been the chance to gain a job and joinery skills. 'It's up to employers to give people a chance,' he says. 'There needs be better quality of training, and better prospects. It's no good having a lot of training if there are no prospects at the end of it.'</p>

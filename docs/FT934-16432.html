			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Observer: Rectoress The fightback has begun. After more than a decade of men colonising the fellowships and student intake of Oxford's former women's colleges, a woman has finally been elected to head one of the university's former male preserves. Professor Marilyn Butler, elected yesterday as Rector of Oxford's Exeter College, is currently King Edward VII professor of English literature at Cambridge. Her husband is David Butler, the renowned academic psephologist. While he became a household name in the 1960s, she was bringing up three children at the same time as writing the doctoral thesis that launched her academic career. Given the inter-college battle for her services, Butler may be the first of many female heads of House. Both Merton and Keble Colleges approached her before the summer, but Exeter came up with a definite offer while the other two were on collective vacation.</p>

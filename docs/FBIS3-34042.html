A ceremony was held on the occasion. It began with Koranic  recitations, and then the Opening Chapter of the Koran was read  to invoke God's mercy on the souls of the noblest of all  creatures, the martyrs of Iraq and the glorious Arab nation.    Comrade Taha Yasin Ramadan then delivered a speech. He began  by conveying the greetings of comrade leader Saddam Husayn to  those who received the medals. He also conveyed his  excellency's wishes of continued pride and victory. He added:  This honoring ceremony crowns the enormous struggle, high  discipline, and true commitment displayed in your performance of  holy missions and tasks.    Ramadan affirmed that the current phase requires further  preparedness, continuous training, and constant vigilance,  because the Mother of Battles is still going on, and also  because the enemies are using all their cards to undermine the  willpower and steadfastness of the noble Iraqis, who thwarted  the most massive aggression and defeated the most ferocious  embargo enforced by all forces of evil and aggression.    Ramadan noted that defending great Iraq by all means is a  holy duty to be performed by all honorable Iraqis. He asserted  that the reconstruction drive is a chapter in the  counteroffensive against the aggressors meant to break the  unfair embargo imposed on Iraq by the enemies of Arabism and  mankind in defiance of all heavenly and earthly laws and in  violation of human rights.    The medal-awarding ceremony was attended by several comrade  members of the National Command and the head of the National  Command General Secretariat Office.</p>

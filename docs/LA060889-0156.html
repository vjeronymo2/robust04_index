			<p><P> June 8, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SWISS SAY KHASHOGGI WILL FIGHT EXTRADITION  </P> <P> Saudi Arabian businessman Adnan Khashoggi has decided to fight extradition to  the United States, where he is wanted on charges of racketeering, Swiss  officials said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Khashoggi, a key middleman in the Iran arms-Contra aid scandal during the  Reagan Administration, was arrested April 18 at the request of American  officials and has since occupied a small cell in Bern's district prison.  </P> <P> The one-time billionaire was indicted in March in New York on charges of  fronting in illegal real estate deals for former Philippines President  Ferdinand Marcos and his wife, Imelda.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Will Present Arguments  </P> <P> The United States had 60 days to formally request extradition and the demand  arrived May 31 -- two weeks before the deadline.  </P> <P> Khashoggi, reportedly in financial difficulties after amassing enormous wealth  through arms deals and other transactions, could have gone at any time to the  United States.  </P> <P> But officials said he chose to fight the U.S. demand.  </P> <P> Switzerland's federal police had to make sure the request was "sufficiently  documented and therefore receivable," Swiss justice department spokesman Joerg  Kistler said.  </P> <P> "That was the case, and Mr. Khashoggi and his lawyers will now present their  arguments against extradition," Kistler said.  </P> <P> "Those arguments will be considered together with the case put by the American  authorities. It will take several weeks before there is a ruling," he said.  </P> <P> Khashoggi has the right to appeal if the Federal Criminal Police rule that the  U.S. request contains sufficient proof of activities that would also be illegal  under Swiss law.  </P> <P> The appeal would be directly to the Swiss Supreme Court in Lausanne and those  proceedings would mean several additional weeks in prison for the flamboyant  Saudi Arabian businessman.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Daughter Visits Daily  </P> <P> In the Iran arms scandal, Khashoggi put up collateral for the initial U.S. arms  sales to Iran but later complained that the Reagan Administration reneged on  its promise to repay him and fellow investors. He was reported to have been  left $10 million short.  </P> <P> In the scandal, which emerged in 1986, arms were sold to Iran in the hope that  American hostages held in Lebanon by pro-Iranian extremists would be released.  Proceeds from the sales were funneled to Contra rebels in Nicaragua.  </P> <P> Khashoggi has U.S. and Swiss lawyers working on his case in Bern. They visit  him several times daily to confer on strategy, as does his daughter.  </P> <P> Because he is detained on a provisional basis, he uses his right to order meals  from outside and gourmet food is delivered by his driver and bodyguards from  the five-star Schweizerhof Hotel.  </P> <P> Khashoggi, 54, had been in Bern for cellular therapy, more commonly known as  rejuvenation treatment.  </P></p>

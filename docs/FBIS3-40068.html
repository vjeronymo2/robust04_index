			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Chinese Material Information Center: "Analysis </F> and Prospects of the Materials Situation"]    [Text] (I)    As regards the current overall economic situation,  macroeconomic control has just begun to show its effect, the  scale of investment still has not been truly reduced, and  inflationary pressures still are very great. It is forecast that  the annual gross value of industrial output will increase by 20  percent or more, the annual scale of fixed asset investment  could break 1 trillion yuan, increasing by 45 percent or more,  and the retail price index will increase by about 13 percent.  In the two months since the estimate, the tightness of funds  could have been somewhat relieved, but it will be difficult for  the materials market to exhibit significant change in supply and  demand. Moreover, led by the anticipated decline in futures and  long-term forward contract prices on several exchanges, the  prices of production materials will essentially maintain a  steady decline and the rise in the annual price index will be  about 40 percent. The weak market trading situation will not  show a significant change. It is estimated that annual steel  production could increase by 15 percent, and with imports, total  resources could break 100 million tons for the first time. Total  annual materials sales for the whole society could reach 1.75  trillion yuan, a 30 percent increase. Within that materials  system sales are forecast to be 630 billion yuan, an increase of  about 35 percent.    Next year the overall economy will have another rapid growth  year, although the growth rate could be a little lower than this  year. According to preliminary estimates, next year the scale  of investments will increase by at least 20 percent. Next year  the economic growth rate and the rate of inflation could both  reach double digits. To maintain economic stability, the  corresponding economic rebound cannot be delayed to the second  quarter of next year. It is understood that in setting up the  plan for next year the guiding thought is to achieve sustained  rapid economic growth as much as possible.    (II)    According to the basic estimates given above, the combined  index of production material prices is expected to continue to  rise, but the increase could be smaller than this year.  Preliminary calculations are for the combined index of prices  influenced by upturning factors to rise by five percentage  points next year. Adding new price rising factors, the rise in  the combined index could exceed 10 percent. Certainly, the  overall characteristic of next year's prices will not simply be  rising or declining. Next year's production material prices  fluctuations could very well exhibit a complicated and  changeable situation, because next year the factors influencing  price fluctuations will increase. Not only must we consider the  domestic economy, we also must consider changes in the  international market, and we must especially consider the  implementation of several recent major reform measures. For  example, reform of the Ministry of Finance tax revenue system,  reform of the financial system, reform of the foreign exchange  and foreign trade systems, and continuing adjustments (or  freeing up) of the prices of energy, basic raw materials, and  transportation could have a huge influence on the economy and  the production materials market. So, structural change will be a  pronounced characteristic of next year's materials market  prices. Both the product mix and the regional structure could  cause them to rise or fall. The characteristics of the market  economy will be even more significant.    In addition, next year the adjusted price of foreign  exchange  could tend to rise. Some experts believe that if China wants to  accelerate the merging of the dual track foreign exchange system  and lessen the impact of "reentry into the GATT," it should be  accompanied with a continued devaluation of the renminbi. If the  foreign exchange rate is merged next year and the foreign  exchange quota system is eliminated, the price of foreign  exchange could reach or exceed 9 yuan to the U.S. dollar. This  would help the international balance of payments, but it also  could promote domestic price rises.    (III)    Based on the above analysis of next year's macroeconomy, we  have calculated the balance of supply and demand for principal  materials. It can be simply described as follows:    1. There still will be a gap between supply and demand for  steel and the market can be expected to rebound. Next year's  steel demand is forecast to increase by 10 percent to 13  percent. As regards resources, domestic production could  increase by 12 percent to 15 percent. With the use of some  reserves, there still would be a rather large gap that will  depend on imports. So, the steel market can be expected to  rebound in the first half of next year. As regards product mix,  the majority of the overstock is in wire rods and threaded  steel. So, it is difficult to expect that the prices of  construction use steel could return to this year's high levels.  Production materials such as some plate and tubing materials,  especially such heavily imported materials as cold-rolled  silicon steel sheets, large diameter seamless tubes, and  galvanized iron could again tend to be tight.    Next year China will still need to import a rather large  amount of steel. At the same time, it also will eliminate the  licensing system for a group of materials including steel and  there will be an increase in destabilizing factors on the steel  market.    2. The prices of nonferrous metals could come out of the low  valley. It is estimated that next year the world economy will  tend to rebound and it could somewhat increase the demand for  nonferrous metals, and the international price could come out of  the valley. The domestic economy will maintain a rather high  acceleration and the demand could continue to rise. The market  price will stumble toward stability and then rebound to a  certain extent. According to overall calculations, next year  copper and aluminum will have to maintain imports no lower than  this year to essentially balance domestic resource supply and  demand.    3. The supply of coal can be assured and the market price  will steadily rise. It is forecast that next year the demand  will continue to steadily rise, increasing by 5 percent to 6  percent and reaching about 1.2 billion tons. Next year coal  production can maintain about a 5 percent rate of increase, and  with a rather high level of reserves, can essentially satisfy  demand. But because of the effect of inadequate transportation  and adjusted prices, the price of coal still will rise steadily.    4. The building materials market will rise steadily. Next  year investment growth will remain a major factor moving the  economy, and the building materials market continue to look  favorable. It is estimated that next year national cement  consumption will continue to increase, exports will remain  steady with this year, and total demand will increase by  approximately 14 percent. Generally, domestic production  capacity can satisfy demand, but there is a pronounced  contradiction in the product mix, and large cement and high  grade cement could still be tight. The market for other building  materials such as glass and ceramics for construction use and  decorating materials also will gradually improve.    5. There is a rather large contradiction in lumber  production  and demand and the market tends to be tight. It is estimated  that next year lumber demand will be largely the same as this  year, but because domestic production also could decline, the  balance of supply and demand will depend more and more on  imported resources. If Western economies recover, the demand for  lumber could increase, creating a tight international market,  and the price could go higher. It appears that next year imports  could continue to be reduced and the price tend to rise.    6. The chemical industry market is both sluggish and  flourishing with product mix the principal contradiction. Next  year with the national economy growing rather rapidly, the  chemical industry market demand could rebound somewhat, but  there is a rather large divergence among various types of  products. The sales of plastic materials such as polyethylene,  polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), PVC resin, and ABS  resin, and natural rubber can be expected to improve and prices  will tend to rise.    7. Automobile market resources are adequate, but prices are  rather greatly effected by policy. Since the third quarter,  influenced by such policies as tight money and increased credit  association controls, the flourishing automobile market suddenly  cooled, dropping everywhere, and the prices of large and small  vehicles generally declined. It is estimated that next year's  automobile production could reach 1.5 million vehicles and with  imports supply can be ensured. As regards the product mix, the  market for heavy vehicles sold mainly to such key industries as  the railroad, energy, and the basic raw materials industry will  still be good. The small vehicle business could be in trouble  compared to this year. As regards the price of automobiles, as  it gradually merges with international market demand, for a  period of time, the domestic price generally should steadily  decline.</p>

			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / Milan bourse at new low amid growing pessimism ITALY'S hard-pressed equity markets suffered a further blow yesterday with the Milan bourse sinking to a new low for the year, while money market interest rates continued to surge. The Comit index of shares fell by 0.47 per cent to 409.76, its lowest level since October 1985. Rates for banks' securities repurchase agreements (repos) with the Bank of Italy climbed to 17.56 per cent from 16.02 on Friday. Analysts blamed the movements on pessimism about Italy's economic and political prospects, which has overwhelmed any fundamental factors about the health of the corporate sector. 'Uncertainty is what drives the market crazy, and we're at the height of uncertainty at the moment,' said one. Sentiment remains overshadowed by concern about the lira, possible further interest rate rises and political instability before parliamentary votes later this week on the mini-budget and privatisation. Italy's credibility has also been hit by the poor handling of treatment for creditors of Efim, the state holding company which is to be wound up. Shares in companies linked with Mr Salvatore Ligresti, the Sicilian property magnate arrested last week in the Milan political corruption scandal, were among the hardest hit. Premafin, Mr Ligresti's main holding group, tumbled 3.4 per cent to L7,100. Dealers were pessimistic about equities and the economy. 'Foreigners are already out of the market; it's Italian funds which are selling now on account of high redemption pressure from investors,' said one. See World Stock Markets</p>

			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Letterboxes for loners: An obscure Dartmoor pastime TOMORROW, around 2,000 members of one of Britain's most eccentric clubs will hold one of their twice yearly 'meets' at the Prison Officers' Social Club at Princetown, Dartmoor. There will be no agenda and no formal structure to the meeting, for the 'organisation' behind the Dartmoor Letterboxers has no officers and no constitution. Nevertheless devotees of this west country cult will travel to the event from Scotland, the north of England and Wales to swap information and reminisce. All share a passion - hunting plastic ice cream boxes, biscuit tins and metal ammunition boxes hidden in boggy hollows and under piles of stones on remote tors. Each 'letterbox' contains a rubber stamp, a book in which to record his or her name, and the address and telephone number of the person who put out the box. All letterboxers travel armed with a rubber stamp pad and many carry their own personalised stamp which they insert in the record book in the box. It is not so very different from the summer day in 1854 when a Dartmoor guide named James Perrott stuck a bottle in a remote part of the moor called Cranmere Pool and left his card in it. The challenge was for people to walk to the pool and leave a calling card or self-addressed postcard to show they had been there. A custom emerged of signing a visitor's book and leaving a self- addressed postcard which the next visitor would carry to a real post box off the moor. Today, the callers' book remains in every letterbox, but the main challenge is to log 100 letterboxes and to collect 100 stamps and so become a member of the Dartmoor Letterboxers 100 Club. 'Although there are now 9,000 recorded members of the 100 club, letterboxing itself is an extremely informal business,' said veteran plodder Godfrey Swinscow, 73. He is the genial retired brewer who has acted as a focal point for the Dartmoor letterboxers since 1978, a year before he founded the 100 club. Some enthusiasts have beaten the figure of 100 letterboxes many times over. Michael Perry, a student from Plymouth has discovered nearly all the boxes and claims to have walked 6,000 miles over the moor in search of them since the age of 10. He has sought out letterboxes as a cub, a scout and with his family, and still spends every second weekend and much of his holiday time letterboxing. 'It's a compulsive pastime. It's challenging, there's an air of mystery to it, and you meet lots of people,' he said. 'A lot of my friends think I'm a bit weird but, when they try letterboxing themselves, most of them get hooked. You've got to be a bit crazy to enjoy it, but my parents still love letterboxing and so do thousands of others.' What is to stop ordinary members of the public discovering, and possibly removing or vandalising, letterboxes they might find when out on the moor? 'Nothing,' says Swinscow, 'except that they would have to be very observant, or very lucky, to find one on foot in a remote area. 'Experience shows that most visitors to Dartmoor rarely walk more than 100 yards from their car. And, of course, if that person is keen enough to walk that far, he or she will probably be an enthusiastic type who is so fascinated by the discovery of a letterbox that we gain another recruit to our ranks.' At this time of year Swinscow is out on the moor most days, checking, cataloguing and plotting the locations of letterboxes, which are constantly arriving and being removed by their 'minders.' If you do find a letterbox by chance while out on the moor, how do you get started as a letterboxer? And how, for that matter, did seasoned letterboxers get going, discover boxes, and go on to 'plant' their own? 'People have to rely a great deal on their initiative, powers of inquiry and on what they learn from other walkers on the moor - often letterboxers themselves,' Swinscow said. He is happy to help aspiring letterboxers get off the mark, but he is also keen that the pastime should retain an air of mystery. Swinscow produces a six-monthly printout of all the known letterboxes on the 365 square miles of the moor. It is available only to enthusiasts and is also the only means of keeping keen letterboxers up to date. This is because boxes come and go, put out by a wide range of people for a variety of reasons. The person who puts out the letterbox is also responsible for its maintenance and, ultimately, for removing it. Swinscow makes it his business to check this process - inevitably on foot. 'Letterboxing brings pleasure to thousands. It is a very good way of making friends, poses a challenge, and provides an added interest for young and possibly slightly reluctant walkers,' he said. 'Above all, it introduces thousands of people to the wonders and mysteries of a marvellous tract of countryside.'

			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / Violence returns to townships: S African leaders compete for scarce resources ahead of budget South Africa's respite from its problems ended at the weekend as at least 18 people died in political violence and ministers in the newly formed all-race government tussled over budget allocations. The killings and political tensions showed the harsh realities facing the new government, following the post-election euphoria. President Nelson Mandela's government also has to make early decisions on economic policy. Fears of a resurgence of violence grew after 12 bodies were discovered on Saturday in a house in Thokoza, a black township east of Johannesburg, in the worst incident since the elections began three weeks ago. Although the political affiliations of the dead were not immediately known, Thokoza had been a centre of clashes between supporters of the victorious African National Congress and the Zulu-dominated Inkatha Freedom party. A soldier was shot dead in front of a hostel in the township yesterday, after four gunmen believed to be Inkatha supporters dragged him from a car. In the KwaZulu/Natal region, where the worst pre-election bloodletting took place, there were at least five politically motivated deaths over the weekend. But Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi urged his Inkatha stalwarts to make peace with their rivals, warning that violence would scare off vital foreign investment. Meanwhile, provincial and national leaders have begun competing over scarce budgetary resources in the run-up to next month's budget. Mr Ben Turok, a radical political scientist from the University of Durban Westville, who has called for increased rates and taxes for whites, has been put in charge of implementing the ANC's reconstruction and development programme in the Pretoria-Witwatersrand-Vereeniging (PWV) region around Johannesburg. This is South Africa's economic heartland, responsible for some 39 per cent of GDP. However, Mr Tokyo Sexwale, the region's premier, has promised wide consultations before imposing any new measures. The cabinet will this week begin shaping its legislative agenda, and Mr Mandela is due to address parliament tomorrow to spell out the government's plans. The budget to be presented by Mr Derek Keys, the finance minister, will have to reconcile many conflicting regional spending needs. The ANC has costed its reconstruction and development programme at R39bn (Pounds 7.1bn) over five years. The previous National party government, of which Mr Keys was a member, said it would cost much more. Observer, Page 15</p>

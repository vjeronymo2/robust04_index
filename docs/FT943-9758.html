			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / International Company News: Annual sales rise by 5% at Coles Myer Coles Myer, the large Australian retailer which is currently trying to arrange the buy-back of a 21.45 per cent stake in itself from Kmart of the US, saw annual sales rise by 5 cent last year, to ADollars 15.92bn (USDollars 11.7bn). The unexciting overall result, however, contained a 10.4 per cent gain in the final quarter - although this figure partly reflected the benefit of an extra trading week (14 weeks in 1994 compared with 13 in the previous year). The group result was also held back by flat sales at the Myer Grace Brothers department store division.</p>

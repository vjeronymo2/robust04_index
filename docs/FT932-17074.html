			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Technology: US puts the emphasis on quality If the US is to compete with Japan and Europe, it must create a 'national quality centre' to co-ordinate the dissemination of total quality management technologies to industries throughout the country, the Washington-based Council on Competitiveness said this week. In a new report*, the Council said that although TQM is now widely recognised in business as a national priority, individual corporations do not have sufficient resources alone 'to meet the aggregate US demand for quality education and information'. The Council - whose members are drawn from industry, academia and labour and who helped produce the Clinton administration's technology policy - said Japan's Union of Scientists and Engineers (Juse) could serve as a model for a new systematic approach to 'quality diffusion'. Juse is a non-profit group of corporations which work together with leading universities to promote quality improvement throughout Japanese industry. With its extensive national network of companies, it conducts research, promotes quality practices and provides training in quality to workers and managers. Ray Stata, chief executive of Analog Devices and a member of the Council on Competitiveness Executive Committee, sees a Juse-like organisation as key to accelerating US quality improvement. The world economy is 'in the midst of a transition in which competition has become more acute,' he said. 'To some extent, it's them - Japan and Europe - or us. We must find more efficient technologies for handling human resources.' In Japan TQM is regularly deployed throughout the company; in the US this is true in only a few firms. Japanese industry has ongoing national programmes to raise quality consciousness in society; Juse's 'QC Circles' focuses the activities of small groups of workers continuously improving and problem solving. The adoption of TQM techniques requires a significant change in US corporate culture. US companies have learned from the Japanese example that they have to work together. 'Ten years ago, in our company and in others, if we found a new way of managing, we would consider that a trade secret,' said Stata. 'But US industry has never been in this kind of a jam before.' * Catalyst for Change: Juse and Japan's national quality system.

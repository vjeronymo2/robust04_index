			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Xiao Wang: "Revision to `Unfair' Law Against Dumping </F> Urged"]    [Text] A senior Chinese trade expert urges the United  States to revise its unfair anti-dumping law, which he claims  has unjustifiably cost China several hundred million dollars  worth of exports.    The U.S., viewing China as a special case because of its  transition from a planned to a market-based economy, agreed in  1988 to revise its law.    The 1988 Comprehensive Trade Law stipulated that the U.S.  Department of Commerce complete studies on China's  market-oriented economic reform and possible revision of  America's anti-dumping law against China by August 23, 1989.  The U.S. was to send specialists to China to examine production  costs and export prices.    However, the whole process was halted after June 4, 1989.    "Now time is up for the two countries to restore contacts on  the issue," said Zhou Shijian deputy director of the Institute  of International Trade Research at the Ministry of Foreign Trade  and Economic Co-operation (MOFTEC).    But Zhou believes the U.S. is unlikely to make its  anti-dumping law against China totally reasonable in the near  future, given America's concerns over its foreign trade balance  and the waxing and waning of domestic trade-protectionist  sentiments.    "Western nations usually espouse protectionism under the  veneer of protecting fair competition, and the U.S. anti-dumping  law against China is unreasonable and unfair, too," Zhou said.    He said exporters from a market-economy country would not be  charged with dumping on the American market so long as their  prices are above domestic levels, but the U.S. won't apply the  same yardstick to China. Chinese exporters are given no  standard price level under which they could face dumping charges.    Zhou said, "How can people abide by a law which is  unpredictable?"    Zhou attributes the lower prices of Chinese exports mainly  to  cheaper labour and lower-quality products.    "In disregard of this fact, the U.S. usually makes a  comparison between Chinese products and their peers from  developed countries, where costs are much higher," he points out.    Thus, Zhou said, the results of the comparison can only be  unfair: Low-priced Chinese products are judged to have been  dumped. What is ridiculous, Zhou said, is that Indian exports to  the U.S., which are comparable in price to China's, are not  regarded as dumping items simply because the U.S. views India as  a market economy and China as a planned one.    "China no longer has a centrally planned economy," Zhou  pointed out. "Foreign-invested enterprises, private business  and township ventures have all sprouted over the past decade.</p>

			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Leading Article: Heseltine at the coal face IT HAS taken Mr Michael Heseltine, Britain's trade and industry secretary, five months to clear his throat and try once more to explain what he thinks to be the appropriate future for the country's coal industry. On October 13 last year, he announced that demand for British Coal's output was falling so fast that he could see no alternative to the company's plan to close 31 of its 50 pits. With the recession at its bleakest, the public edgy and the Tory backbenches in a flush of post-election enthusiasm for lording it over a government with a slim majority, the proposals hit an unscaleable wall of resistance. Yesterday, Mr Heseltine looked muscular enough to scale that wall. He now thinks that 12 of the 31 doomed pits can be saved. But at what cost has this has been achieved, financially and in terms of additional muddle for Britain's energy industries? The 150-page document Mr Heseltine produced yesterday to support his case at least has the merit of stating soundly, if inelegantly, the principles upon which energy policy should be based. It says: 'Competitive markets provide the best means of ensuring that the nation has access to secure, diverse and sustainable supplies of energy in the forms that people and businesses want, and at competitive prices.' It is also obvious that Mr Heseltine has not changed his view that the coal industry faces decline, at the hands of cleaner, cheaper gas and continued supplies of cheap electricity from nuclear power stations where construction costs have been written off and where decommissioning costs are there to be paid whether they are shut down or kept going. Resisting pressure The government has resisted most of the most foolish things urged by its critics. It will not delay the liberalisation of the electricity supply market; it will not switch off supplies of French electricity; it will not interfere with freely agreed contracts based on gas-fired power stations. It will not instruct the big electricity generators, National Power and PowerGen, to buy more coal than they think fit. Or at least, it will not do so openly. At the same time, it has made concessions to the influential Commons Trade and Industry Committee which are at worst harmless. There will, for example, be an annual energy report and a panel of energy advisers, perhaps along the lines of the Treasury's panel of forecasters. Both these innovations could improve the quality of public debate and force the government to set its market-led energy policies in a strategic context and so avoid conceding by default the argument that it lacks an energy policy. Unclear picture So far, not so bad. The problem is that for all its welter of detail, the report fails to give anything like a precise picture of the cost of the subsidies it proposes to make British coal more saleable. Since the report also suggests the government may lean on the power generators to carry more stocks than they need, there is a further potential line of subsidy under the table. Worryingly, no clear time limit is set on these subventions, raising the possibility that a weak government will in practice back off from difficult decisions, requiring the taxpayer to pick up any bill British Coal happens to run up. In other words, it could be business as usual for the British coal industry. This need not be the outcome. If the government does as it promises and presses on quickly with a privatisation bill, while lifting British Coal's effective monopoly on the licensing of mines and putting all redundant pits up for sale, the coal industry could be quite swiftly transferred to the private sector. There, it is much more likely to achieve the productivity advances which consultants have argued to be feasible. Since the subsidies proposed yesterday will also be available to private sector coal companies, they could be used as fixed-term sweeteners for privatisation deals. Mr Heseltine has the makings of the right policy, but it will take more months of political skill and determination to achieve it. His next steps should be to come clean about its cost and get on with the job of privatisation.</p>

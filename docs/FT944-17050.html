			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Sarajevo prepares for third winter of suffering: Survival is the watchword of all in the city Cold weather has come early to Bosnia. The first blanket of snow on the high land around Sarajevo signals the start of a third winter of suffering for the 340,000 people trapped in the besieged capital. As the war rumbles on around the city, its residents continue to be threatened by sniper fire and a shortage of food and other supplies. Most have become anaesthetised to the continuing diplomatic and military efforts. Hopes raised for a settlement have too often been dashed by the turn of events. Instead, the word 'survival' is on everyone's lips as they try to prepare for the difficult months ahead. 'What more can we do but survive and smile,' asked Mrs Amela Kurtovic, who has lost three of her family since the start of the war. Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, has vowed to strangle Sarajevo unless peace can be agreed on his terms. His troops have surrounded the city since April 1992 and they continue to block United Nations aid convoys when it suits them. Last weekend, the UN resumed aid flights after a two-week stoppage, forced by the Bosnian Serbs, during which food reserves became dangerously low. Sarajevo's mayor, Mr Tareq Kupusovic, said the city had only two days of reserves and feared that 'if the airport is closed again before the city has time to build up its reserves there will be a crisis'. In an attempt to regain some kind of self-sufficiency, many Sarajevans have planted small allotments throughout the city. Cabbages, carrots and potatoes grow in what used to be the 1984 Winter Olympics village, only a few hundred metres from the front line. A screen of overturned cars and buses helps protect gardeners from Serb snipers. Nearby, the city's cigarette factory, which produces a few thousand Drina cigarettes a day from stock left from before the war, has moved its machinery underground so that production continues whatever conditions on the streets. While the UN protects and feeds the city, Sarajevo's civic administration tries to provide a range of services from public transport and utilities to a planned reconstruction programme. A rather shaky local tax structure was introduced at the end of August which levies up to 40 per cent income tax on commercial enterprises. But revenues are so low that most of the 300 people working in the city hall are paid in packets of Drinas. This barely sustainable economic situation is made worse by the constant threat to life. Nearly nine months after Nato forced the Bosnian Serbs into signing a ceasefire agreement to remove heavy weapons from a 12-mile zone around the city, people are still being killed almost daily. On Saturday, one person was killed and 11 wounded in a sniper attack on a tram in the city centre. This brought civilian casualties since April, 1992 to 10,078 dead and around 58,500 wounded. As a result, cars and UN vehicles drive at breakneck speeds and pedestrians half run to avoid being exposed to the sniper's sights for too long. 'The place feels like a concentration camp,' says Mrs Ullsija Dzubur who works at the city hall. 'We know we could be killed at any time.' Asking the people of Sarajevo how much longer they think the situation can last elicits only shrugs and sighs. The future reaches only to the next few days. However, Lt-Gen Sir Michael Rose, UN commander in Bosnia, is cautiously optimistic that the policy of isolating the Bosnian Serbs from their former masters in Serbia could end the impasse. President Slobodan Milosovic of Serbia cut off nearly all military and economic supplies to the Bosnian Serbs in early August when Mr Karadzic rejected the peace plan drawn up the the international contact group. 'The isolation policy of the contact group is working. . . . but we must be careful not to make them feel cornered,' he warns. In the meantime his job is to keep aid flowing. Yesterday, he met Gen Ratko Mladic, head of the Bosnian Serb army, to try to obtain assurances that supply routes would stay open. But, while Sarajevo remains under siege - Mr Karadzic's most important bargaining chip - this is by no means guaranteed.</p>

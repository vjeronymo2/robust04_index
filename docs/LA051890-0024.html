			<p><P> May 18, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> Piscopo, Miller Beer Rapped: A New York federal judge has rapped Miller Brewing  Co., its ad agency and comedian Joe Piscopo by refusing to dismiss a copyright  infringement suit against them brought by the Fat Boys rap group. At issue is a  nationally-broadcast Miller Brewing television commercial featuring Piscopo and  three Fat Boys look-alikes performing in the group's distinctive style. The Fat  Boys had refused to appear in the ad, and U.S. District Judge Charles Haight  said Miller and Piscopo exercised "bad faith and evasive motive" by copying the  group. GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

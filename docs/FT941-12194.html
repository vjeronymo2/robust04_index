			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Travel industry wins tax deferral Imposition of the new tax on aircraft passengers is to be deferred by a month until November 1 after pressure from the travel ind-ustry. Sir John Cope, the paymaster general, told the Commons last night that summer holiday brochures offering holidays until the end of October had already been printed - many with no-surcharge guarantees - when Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, announced the new tax in the Budget on November 30. As MPs began debating the committee stage of the finance bill, which implements the Budget, Sir John agreed that it was unreasonable to expect tour operators to take into account 'the theoretical possibility of a new tax' when offering such brochure guarantees. The new tax - Pounds 5 for passengers on flights to British and European Union destinations and Pounds 10 elsewhere - was attacked by Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs. The tax was estimated to yield about Pounds 115m in 1994-95 had it been introduced on October 1. This has been revised to Pounds 90m. Travel companies welcomed the postponement, though some said that they would continue to argue for the tax's abolition. The Association of British Travel Agents said imposing the tax from the beginning of October could have driven some smaller, specialist tour operators out of business. Companies would have had to absorb the cost of the tax themselves. Abta said smaller companies might have found this ruinous. The Federation of Tour Operators, whose members account for 90 per cent of overseas package holidays sold in the UK, welcomed the postponement but added: 'We remain opposed to the principle of a travel and tourism tax. We hope that this tax will be short-lived.' A Labour attempt to delay the tax until a report had been presented to parliament on its effect on the air transport industry and tourism was defeated by a government majority of 34 (312-278). Debate on the committee stage of the bill will be resumed later today.</p>

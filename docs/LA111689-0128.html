			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONSTRUCTION CURBS OKD FOR PICO-ROBERTSON AREA  </P> <P> Apartment and condominium projects in a 15-block neighborhood near the  intersection of Pico and Robertson boulevards will be required to provide  deeper front yards and additional landscaping under temporary building  restrictions approved Tuesday by the Los Angeles City Council.  </P> <P> The restrictions, proposed by Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky because of complaints  about a surge in building, are intended to prevent new projects from  overwhelming duplexes and small apartments that make up the core of the  neighborhood. The restrictions limit most construction to three stories and  require developers of taller buildings to set back upper floors at least 10  feet.  </P> <P> "They are designed to improve the aesthetic quality of development and make it  compatible in scale and mass with the existing units," said Vivian Rescalvo,  planning deputy to Yaroslavsky. "People were just tired of seeing these  buildings go in with no front yards and no landscaping."  </P> <P> The restrictions require developers to provide 20-foot-deep front yards, five  feet deeper than normal. They also require a minimum of 100 square feet of open  space for each dwelling unit and at least one tree for every three dwelling  units.  </P> <P> Miriam Bertram, an official of the Crestview Neighborhood Assn., which first  asked for building curbs in January, said the group welcomed the restrictions  but had hoped they would be tougher. The association, for example, asked for a  25-foot front-yard setback, but the Planning Commission opted for 20 feet.  </P> <P> "We were extraordinarily discouraged before the Planning Commission," said  Bertram, secretary for the 750-household association, which represents renters  and homeowners south of the affected area. "But we are pleased that at least  there is something."  </P> <P> Rescalvo said 20 new projects have been proposed this year for the  neighborhood, which is bounded by Pickford Street and La Cienega Boulevard in  addition to Pico and Robertson. In June, the council imposed similar  restrictions in an adjacent neighborhood north of Pico and south of the Beverly  Hills city line, where old apartment buildings were being demolished for  condominiums.  </P> <P> The new limits will be in effect for at least one year while planning officials  draft permanent guidelines for the two neighborhoods. Rescalvo said she expects  those guidelines in large part to mirror the temporary ones.  </P></p>

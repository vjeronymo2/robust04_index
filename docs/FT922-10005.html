			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Payments code wins prompt response - In A Nutshell Nearly 400 companies have signed up for the prompt payment code launched by the Confederation of British Industry two months ago. Firms which pledge support for the code agree to set the terms of payment at the outset of a deal and to stick to them. They also promise to provide suppliers with clear guidance on payment procedures and inform them of any disputes immediately. A total of 380 companies have pledged their support including Anglian Water, BAT Industries, Cadbury Schweppes, Esso UK and Whitbread. However, small business owners want the government to do more to tackle the problem of late payments but many appear reluctant to do anything to improve the position themselves. Six out of 10 small businesses want the creation of a special government office to deal with late payment claims while 56 per cent want a code of payment practice which companies would have to adhere to, according to a survey by Barclays Bank. But many small businesses appear complacent with 46 per cent admitting to doing nothing about the problem compared with 42 per cent which followed up late payments promptly. Twenty-three per cent of the 500 businesses polled said late payments had created severe cash flow problems. In a separate survey by National Westminster Bank, 40 per cent of business polled said they were not being paid on time compared with almost 50 per cent of those surveyed in July 1991.</p>

			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Early permission may be sought for Sizewell C NUCLEAR ELECTRIC, the state-owned nuclear power utility, is likely to seek planning permission for Sizewell C power station in Suffolk before the government decides whether to approve further plants. A formal application for the Pounds 3bn twin-reactor plan could be submitted to the local authority later this year - two years before the outcome of a ministerial review of nuclear power economics is known. Even if planning permission is granted, a start to construction in late 1994 would still depend on a favourable outcome of the review. Sizewell B, which was under construction before the government announced a moratorium on nuclear expansion, is due for completion in 1994. It is Britain's first pressurised water reactor (PWR) power station. Planning permission has been granted, subject to the outcome of the review, for a further PWR at Hinkley Point in Somerset, but Nuclear Electric would prefer to build Sizewell C first. Mr Brian George, Nuclear Electric's executive director for construction and future projects, said yesterday the company would be taking a commercial risk if it decided to proceed with a planning application for Sizewell C before the outcome of the review was known. He said granting of planning permission in advance would enable a start to be made immediately in 1994 if the outcome of the review was favourable. Considerable expertise had been acquired during the construction of Sizewell B, and there would be advantages in transferring manpower to the C station site. Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, who was paying his first visit to the Sizewell site yesterday, said that it was a matter for Nuclear Electric whether or not it submitted a planning application. This would not influence the outcome of the review of nuclear economics.</p>

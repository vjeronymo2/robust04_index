			<p>BFN     [Text] Police yesterday issued arrest warrants for two  Iranians allegedly involved in a foiled truck-bomb plot believed  to have been aimed at the Israeli Embassy in March, Bangkok  Metropolitan Police Chief Pol Lt Gen [Police Lieutenant General]  Chaisit Kanchanakit said.    However, Chaisit admitted that it was not possible that the  men were still in Thailand.    Mohammad Lotfollah and Hossein Shahriarifar, both about 40  years old, have been identified by police in connection with the  plot.    Police said they had asked Interpol to help.    "We still don't know where they are living but we are  certain  that they left the country through the southern border of  Thailand," Chaisit said. [background passage omitted]</p>

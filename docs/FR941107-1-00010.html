			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On August 23, 1993, the FAA issued AD 93&hyph;17&hyph;04, amendment 39&hyph;8674 (58 FR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 47036, September 7, 1993), applicable to all British Aerospace Model BAe 146 series  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> airplanes, to require repetitive eddy current or ultra high sensitivity penetrant inspections  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to detect cracking of the upper main fitting of the nose landing gear (NLG), and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> replacement or repair of cracked parts. That action was prompted by reports of cracking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the main fittings of the NLG. The actions required by that AD are intended to prevent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> failure of the main fitting, which could lead to collapse of the NLG during landing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AD 93&hyph;17&hyph;04 is applicable only to British Aerospace Model BAe 146 series  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> airplanes. Since issuance of that AD, however, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which is the airworthiness authority for the United Kingdom, has advised that additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> airplanes may be subject to the same unsafe condition addressed by the existing AD  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action. Further analysis has indicated that cracking of the upper main fitting of the NLG  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may occur on all British Aerospace Model Avro 146&hyph;RJ series airplanes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> British Aerospace has issued Revision 2, dated July 10, 1993, of Service Bulletin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> S.B. 32&hyph;131. The inspection procedures described in this revision are identical to those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described in Revision 1 of the service bulletin (which was referenced in AD 93&hyph;17&hyph;04).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This revision only expands the effectivity listing to include additional airplanes. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CAA classified this service bulletin as mandatory.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This airplane model is manufactured in the United Kingdom and is type  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of Section 21.29 of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the CAA has kept the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the CAA, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, the proposed AD  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would require repetitive eddy current or ultra high sensitivity penetrant inspections, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> replacement or repair of cracked parts. The actions would be required to be accomplished  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in accordance with the service bulletin described previously. This proposed rule would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be applicable only to Model Avro 146&hyph;RJ series airplanes.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Note:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The FAA's normal policy is that when an AD requires a substantive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> change, such as a change (expansion) in its applicability, the ``old'' AD is superseded by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> removing it from the system and a new AD is added. In the case of this AD action, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FAA normally would have proposed superseding AD 93&hyph;17&hyph;04 to expand its applicability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to include Model Avro 146&hyph;RJ series airplanes as the additional affected airplanes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, in reconsideration of the entire fleet size that would be affected by a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supersedure action, and the consequent workload associated with revising maintenance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> record entries, the FAA has determined that a less burdensome approach is to issue a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> separate AD applicable only to these additional airplanes. This AD does not supersede  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AD 93&hyph;17&hyph;04; airplanes listed in the applicability of AD 93&hyph;17&hyph;04 are required to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continue to comply with the requirements of that AD. This proposed AD is a separate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AD action, and is applicable to all British Aerospace Model Avro 146&hyph;RJ series  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> airplanes.)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FAA estimates that 3 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed AD, that it would take approximately 2.5 work hours per airplane to accomplish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $60 per work hour. Based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be $450, or $150 per airplane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adopted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federalism Assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Flexibility Act.

A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Docket at the location provided under the caption  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> The Proposed Amendment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=2 --> PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES <!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> 1.

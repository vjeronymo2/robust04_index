			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Investment side helps lift Govett to Dollars 27.3m Govett &amp; Co, the fund management and insurance group, announced a sharp rise in investment management profits in spite of weaker market conditions in the first half of 1993. The fund management division saw profits increase by 62 per cent, from Dollars 8.37m to Dollars 13.6m (Pounds 8.7m), despite increased redemptions from US retail investors and a slow down in capital inflows after the rise in US interest rates. Interim pre-tax profits rose by 20 per cent from Dollars 22.8m to Dollars 27.3m on the back of Dollars 2.5bn additional funds under management from acquisitions, the launch of new funds, and some Dollars 200m of new institutional client money. The company launched three new mutual funds in the US in the first half of 1994, and a further two funds in the UK. At the end of June, it had Dollars 8.6bn of funds under management or administration. Govett has decided that the key to increasing the build up of funds is to strengthen its distribution. It has secured agreements with Charles Schwab, Paine Webber and Smith Barney to distribute its products, and is looking for other similar deals. Its insurance division saw profits rise from Dollars 8.24m to Dollars 9.7m, and the group exceeded its budget in achieving Dollars 107m of new premium sales. However, earnings from development capital investment fell from Dollars 3.41m to Dollars 3.27m. The company is seeking to increase funds under management through acquisition, and has some Dollars 60m liquid funds to spend on any purchases. It is also planning to upgrade its quotation from Nasdaq to the New York Stock Exchange, and will work on the required expansion of its shareholder base in order to achieve this. Fully diluted earnings per share rose 20 per cent to 30.5 cents. The company is paying an interim dividend of 11 cents, up from 10 cents.</p>

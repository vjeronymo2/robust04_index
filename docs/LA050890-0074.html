			<p><P> May 8, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> THE MYSTIQUE OF 'PHANTOM';  </P> <P> THEATER: THE SHOW'S STILL A FEAST AS GUILLAUME TAKES CONTROL.  </P> <P> Those who've harbored concerns that "The Phantom of the Opera" minus Michael  Crawford might be a banquet without a main course can set aside their fears. A  glance Sunday at Crawford's replacement -- Robert Guillaume -- gave every  indication that the feast may have shifted somewhat, but that it does go on.  </P> <P> And a feast it is. The Andrew Lloyd Webber musical, less than a month away from  celebrating its first year in Los Angeles, is in rip-roaring shape: a  sumptuous, smooth-as-silk super-spectacle. Graceful leading lady Dale Kristien  is now several cuts above her own opening night performance as Christine Daae,  object of the Phantom's obsessions, while Reece Holland, as her suitor Raoul,  is in equally emancipated form and voice.  </P> <P> The confidence of this well-practiced cast can only have created a welcoming  crucible for the newcomer, Guillaume. The role of the lonely, disfigured man  behind the mask can't be measured in terms of minutes on stage, which are  surprisingly few but intensely demanding. Yet at the end of his first week in  Los Angeles, Guillaume was clearly in growing control of the part, if just as  clearly still in the process of making it his. After all, the Michaelmania that  accompanied Crawford's last weeks in the show had to be a tough act to follow.  But Guillaume is doing the only sensible thing: He is becoming his own monster.  </P> <P> This naturally entails a slightly different slant. So far, the body language is  less dependent on a limber sexuality and graceful gestures of the hands. This  is a gruffer monster. Pitch and tonality are angrier, the hands more stressed.  His rage is both more palpable and more concealed. Only in the final scenes,  when all is lost, and after the compassionate Christine has shown the Phantom  the affection no one had ever before proffered, does Guillaume allow the  humanity to finally break through.  </P> <P> This may shift some as the performance grows (and we shall pay another visit at  a later date to note the changes). It's a gestation that is developing almost  before our eyes -- from a certain bristling severity in the earlier scenes to a  full-blown vulnerability and resignation of the soul in the concluding ones.  What is never in doubt -- and Sunday's audience seemed instinctively to know  this -- is that Guillaume is mastering his Phantom.  </P> <P> After all, as a show this is a thumping-good fairy-tale on the grandest scale,  a trip through Fantasyland that's akin to entering a sort of Disneyland for  adults. It is furthermore a consummate act of techno-prestidigitation that  relies as much on the versatility of Maria Bjornson's magnificent sets and  costumes, Andrew Bridges' light tricks and Hal Prince's inventive direction, as  it does on the undeniable skill of the players.  </P> <P> The fact that it is all splendidly executed to the soaring strains of Lloyd  Webber's instantly hummable melodies conspires to enhance "The Phantom's"  phenomenal and unprecedented popularity with the public. It floats on a magic  all its own that has nothing or little to do with depth or content, which are  beside the point.  </P> <P> Notably, no one at Sunday's packed matinee was overheard bemoaning Crawford's  departure, and the thundering ovation that greeted Guillaume at the curtain  call only confirmed that it's the show and not the actor -- masked and buried  as he is under an inch of make-up -- that the mystique of "Phantom" is about.  </P> <P> Crawford happened to be the first one to create the role -- and handsomely. But  to Sunday's crowd, Guillaume was every bit as thrilling as his predecessor.  Whatever the differences, they simply didn't matter.  </P> <P> At the Ahmanson, 135 N. Grand Ave., Tuesdays through Saturdays, 8 p.m.;  matinees Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, 2 p.m. Indefinitely. $32.50-$50;  (800) 762-7666.  </P> <P> </P></p>

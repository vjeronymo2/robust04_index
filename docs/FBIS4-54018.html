			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [By Hiroshi Inoue] </F>   [Text] (London--14 May) British leading computer maker ICL  reached an agreement with Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT)  to provide the latter with consulting services encompassing all  phases of information security systems. The services will cover  all information computerized by NTT in the areas of customer and  employee data. NTT has already launched a joint study with ICL  to review the adequacy of information management and, if  necessary, plans to procure equipment and software to reinforce  its information security systems.    NTT currently stores and manages computerized data on  individuals and clients for about 230,000 employees and 57.3  million circuits. The current review on the status of security  management was initiated because advances in data processing and  communications technology have increased the risk of illegal  exploitation or theft of personal information.    ICL was chosen for the consulting contract because of its  participation as a principal player in the European Union's (EU)  information safety management technology-enhancement project  (commonly referred to as the SESAME Project), abundant knowledge  of the subject matter and its extensive record providing  information security services to the British Government and  major European and U.S. businesses.    ICL has already submitted its opinion paper on improving the  security management technology of NTT's information systems and  both firms are now undertaking a detailed review in response to  that paper. It appears that the improvement actions being  considered include restrictions on access to computer networks  through the use of integrated circuit cards and protective  technology which prevents illegal outside access to data bases.    NTT is expanding its purchases of materials and equipment  from overseas sources, but the EU has always been discontented  with what it viewed as NTT's preference for U.S. sources. There  is the potential that the current consulting agreement with ICL  will lead to the procurement of security-related equipment and  software from ICL. Fujitsu holds an 80-percent ownership  position in ICL and will provide the latter with operational  support.</p>

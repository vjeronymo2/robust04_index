			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Survey of New Broadcast and Communication Media (5): A 'bouquet of channels' - How pay television is starting to expand in Europe Pay television continues to expand in continental Europe with the two main established players, Canal Plus, the French-based broadcaster and FilmNet of Belgium drawing up ambitious plans for international development. Canal Plus, which has Europe's largest subscription television base - over 5.8m subscribers by the middle of this year - is hard at work preparing the way for the launch of digital services, possibly by the end of next year, looking at ways of breaking into the US cable market and also starting to think about channels that could become global. Last month the company reported an operating profit of FFr888m for the first half of this year - an increase of 2.8 per cent on last time. FilmNet, owned by Richemont, the tobacco and luxury goods company and M-Net International, the South African pay television company, is considerably smaller than Canal Plus but has started to expand in Europe from its first bases in the Netherlands and Scandanavia. At the beginning of this month FilmNet, which already has more than 700,000 subscribers across Europe, launched the first premium movie and sports channel in Greece. The channel, broadcasting 24 hours a day, will be available in the Athens and Thessaloniki region and has the potential to reach around 50 per cent of the Greek population. What is the first pay television channel in Greece will be operated by Super Hellas, a local company which will bring together Greek investors and Nethold, FilmNet's parent company. On the same day, another new FilmNet channel was launched in Poland and central Europe, which means that the pay television group now broadcasts different channels in Belgium, the Netherlands, the Nordic countries, Poland, central Europe and Greece. FilmNet, which began broadcasting in the Netherlands in 1985, specialises in providing two channels for a single subscription - The Complete Movie Channel which transmits films 24 hours a day and FilmNet Plus, which combines films, sport, children's programmes and live entertainment. The FilmNet parent Nethold is expanding its business across Europe with the launch of MultiChoice, a company set up to offer a wide range of subscription channels for satellite, cable and conventional broadcasts. The 'bouquet' of channels offered by MultiChoice includes FilmNet, The Discovery Channel, Country Music Television Europe, The Children's Channel, The Adult Channel and QVC, the home shopping channel. Apart from Belgium, the Netherlands and the Nordic countries MultiChoice currently operates in Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Croatia and Poland. This month Mr Jonathan Shier, former deputy managing director and sales director of Thames Television, joins the MultiChoice headquarters team at Hoofddorp in the Netherlands as managing director for eastern and central Europe. Earlier this year Richemont spent Dollars 180m acquiring a 25 per cent stake in Telepiu, the Italian pay television operator which broadcasts two encrypted pay television channels featuring films and sports events and one unencrypted channel specialising in documentaries and cultural programmes. For Canal Plus, which is active in both television and feature film production, the challenge is to extend its dominance in terrestrial pay television services to its newer satellite channels and on to the wider choice that digital television, using compression technology, can offer. Mr Claude Ravilly, executive vice president and chief financial officer of Canal Plus, believes there will be more competition when digital television arrives as more channels can be offered to the consumer. 'We believe we have the ability to compete strongly because we know how to create programme values and we know how to sell to homes and market subscriptions. It will be difficult to compete with Canal Plus,' says Mr Ravilly. Canal Plus has one problem to deal with, however. For the first time in its history the main Canal Plus channel, which specialises in movies and sport, had a significant shortfall between new subscriptions and cancellations in the first half of this year. The latter totalled 170,000 while there were 139,000 new subscriptions. In the same period last year there was a net growth of 36,000 subscribers. Mr Ravilly blames the shortfall on the worsening economic climate in France. He concedes that saturation point for Canal Plus in France may come at 4m to 4.4m subscribers. Canal Plus hopes the numbers will be boosted by the continuing introduction of a new receiver box and smart card system which is cutting the rate of piracy. Where the new receiver has been introduced, there has been an average increase of 10 per cent in subscriptions - in Toulouse, however, the growth was 30 per cent, evidence of the scale of piracy in the area. In France the group estimates that there will be 3.74m individual Canal Plus subscribers by the end of this year. The total Canal Plus universe, including services owned with partners in Belgium, Spain, Germany and Africa is expected to exceed 6m by the end of December. The forecast includes 950,000 subscribers in Spain and 900,000 in Germany. In addition, Canalsatellite in which Compagnie General des Eaux has a 30 per cent stake, is expected to have 200,000 subscribers. The thematic channels offered by the Canalsatellite 'bouquet' satellite channels, are designed for those who are unlikely to be able to get cable television. The choice ranges from film channels and the French version of Eurosport to the French music channel MCM to Canal J for children and Canal Jimmy for young adults. It is a strong base from which to take on a major future challenge.</p>

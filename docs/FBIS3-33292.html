The  president's friends also are trying to prove that Franco,  secluded in Juiz de Fora, does not feel depressed by the  consequences of his merry behavior during Carnival.    Telemig [expansion unknown] director Roberto Medeiros, who  is  one of Franco's closest friends, said: "The president is very  happy; he is cheerful and in good spirits."    In the meantime, despite so much "happiness," Franco remains  isolated in either his downtown apartment or his home in the  Parque Imperial compound. In his apartment, Franco only  received Secretary General of the Presidency Mauro Durante,  adviser Saulo Moreira, his secretary Neusa Mitterhoff, and his  friend Roberto Medeiros. On 18 February, as he left his  apartment for another appointment with the dentist, Franco  looked depressed. Franco spent some 130 minutes at dentist Luis  Serrato's office, from where he went to his house located far  from the downtown area.    Another friend of Franco's commented: "The president is no  longer worried about what happened in Carnival. What worries  him is the inflation rate, the serious national problems; that  is why he looks serious."    Franco will return to Brasilia on 20 February, according to  Acting Press Secretary Fernando Costa, who also denied the  president met Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso in Juiz  de Fora on 18 February.</p>

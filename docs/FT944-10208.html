			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / UK Company News: LIMIT underwriting capacity rises 15% London Insurance Market Investment Trust, the largest Lloyd's investment trust, yesterday announced a 15 per cent increase in its underwriting capacity, alongside its first interim results. LIMIT's maximum capacity, which is allocated to 101 syndicates managed by 33 agents, rose from Pounds 502.5m to Pounds 580m for 1995, after a valuation of its funds on August 31. It is one of 25 new corporate capital groups which underwrite about Pounds 1.6bn of premiums out of Lloyd's total capacity of Pounds 10.9bn. Pre-tax profits were Pounds 4.97m on investment income of Pounds 5.73m in the six months to September 30. Under Lloyd's three-year accounting convention, income for the period does not include results from underwriting. Mr Jonathan Agnew, chairman, said underwriting remained favourable this year with stable premium rates and satisfactory levels of claims. Earnings per share came out at 1.42p and the board declared an interim dividend of 1p.</p>

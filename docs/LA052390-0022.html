			<p><P> May 23, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SEN. CRANSTON ON USING PEACE DIVIDEND FOR NATIONAL NEEDS  </P> <P> I was pleased to see Cranston's thoughtful analysis of the peace dividend. He  clearly has recognized that the real danger to our security comes from wasted  lives and crumbling infrastructure and not from Soviet missiles.  </P> <P> I would like to have seen him allocate a small fraction of the peace dividend  toward helping developing nations overcome hunger and poverty.  </P> <P> The Harvest of Peace Resolution, introduced in the Senate by Sen. Mark Hatfield  (R-Ore.), sets forth a vision of a world in which money spent on arms is  directed instead toward human needs, and in which the U.S. provides leadership  in reducing arms sales and resolving conflicts by negotiation. I hope that now  that Cranston has completed his study of the peace dividend, he will join in  co-sponsoring this resolution.  </P> <P> PAUL C. EKLOF  </P> <P> Costa Mesa  </P></p>

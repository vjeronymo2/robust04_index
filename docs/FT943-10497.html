			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / International Company News: TCI and Viacom in pact talks Tele-Communications (TCI), the largest operator of cable systems in the US, and Viacom, the entertainment group, yesterday confirmed that they were in talks about a strategic pact between some of their businesses. TCI said yesterday it had been in conversations for some time with Viacom as well as other companies, but declined to comment on reports that the Viacom talks focused on a potential merger of cable and programming operations and on the sale of Viacom's Madison Square Garden division. Viacom, which earlier this year succeeded in its long struggle to take over Paramount Communications, has been looking for ways to rationalise its huge portfolio. The attraction of an alliance between the two groups, according to investment analysts, would be to link Viacom's Showtime pay-cable operations with TCI's Encore service. TCI could also add value to Viacom's cable television operations, they said. However, any talks would have to address the antitrust suit filed by Viacom against TCI last year during the tussle over Paramount. TCI threw its weight behind QVC, a rival bidder for Paramount. Viacom is known to be keen to sell Madison Square Garden, which it bought from Paramount. The division includes the New York Rangers hockey team and the New York Knicks basketball team. Viacom said yesterday it had been discussing a number of initiatives, but would not comment on speculation.</p>

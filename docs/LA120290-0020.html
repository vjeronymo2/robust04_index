			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: MARILYN AS A MOM:  </P> <P> The Role She Lost  </P> <P> When Fox Broadcasting Co. airs its one-hour special, "Marilyn: Something's Got  to Give," on Dec. 13 at 9 p.m., we'll see Marilyn Monroe the closest she ever  came to the motherhood she so desperately wanted.  </P> <P> The Fox documentary chronicles the final months in the life and career of the  doomed star, with never-before-seen footage from the last film she worked on --  "Something's Got to Give." Twentieth Century Fox fired her from the film just  after her 36th birthday, June 1, 1962. She committed suicide about two months  later.  </P> <P> The comedy, in which Monroe had her first screen role as a mother, was never  completed. In real life, Monroe had undergone abortions and suffered  miscarriages and was known to be nearly obsessed about having children,  according to some Hollywood historians.  </P> <P> Alexandra Heilweil and Robert Christopher Morley played Monroe's two young  children for about eight weeks until the studio pulled the plug, reportedly  because Monroe missed so many work days.  </P> <P> So intent were the Fox Broadcasting producers on interviewing the two for the  documentary that they placed ads in several newspapers and later hired a  private investigator to track them down.  </P> <P> Heilweil, 5 at the time "Something" was in its troubled production, is now 33.  A physicist, she's currently "between jobs," working as a waitress in Florida.  "I really don't remember much (about the filming)," she says. "It was a long  time ago."  </P> <P> Morley (now legally Christopher Robert Morley) was 8 during the shoot. Now 37,  he's a Wall Street bond trader.  </P> <P> "One of the things that I remember most about her is that she was very  personable," Morley says of Monroe. "You can sense as a little kid who really  cares about you and who could care less. I distinctly remember that she was  very warm, that she would spend time talking to you as another human being, as  opposed to some of the other actors (Dean Martin, Cyd Charisse and Wally Cox  co-starred). At least as a kid, it felt pretty genuine.  </P> <P> "She was very sensitive. I remember my scenes with her a lot more than with the  others, which were very mechanical."  </P> <P> Fox Broadcasting's Henry Schipper, who wrote, narrated and co-produced the  special with Ken Turner, says that outtakes from the ill-fated production --  which later was made as "Move Over, Darling" -- show a maternal Monroe both  on-camera and off.  </P> <P> After one take, he notes, the camera captured her "rolling around with the two  kids, tickling them, laughing, really enjoying them. The emotions on her face  as she looks at them are marvelous . . . in the outtakes, you get a profile of  Marilyn Monroe as a real person."  </P> <P> Morley, of course, was too young at the time to know if Monroe felt emotional  reverberations from real life in her scripted role as a mother. But, in  retrospect, he senses the possibility.  </P> <P> " . . . The only photo I have from that time is a very small picture of Marilyn  hugging the two kids," Morley said.  </P> <P> Like Monroe, the work of Morley and Heilweil in "Something's Got to Give" was  also final. Neither performed again. John M. Wilson  </P></p>

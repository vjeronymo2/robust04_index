			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Israel and Jordan move closer to full peace treaty JORDAN yesterday initialled an outline peace agreement with Israel, becoming the first Arab state to reach an understanding with the Jewish state since Egypt signed a full peace with its neighbour in 1979. In a sign of the growing momentum for peace in the Middle East, Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, yesterday visited Morocco for talks with King Hassan. Later Mr Rabin said: 'I don't believe that it will take too long before additional Arab countries will recognise Israel.' In Rabat, a spokesman for Mr Rabin said: 'It is the first time an Israeli prime minister has met an Arab leader out in public, other than the Egyptian leaders.' The developments came only a day after Israel signed its outline agreement with the Palestinians. In Washington, where the ceremony took place, Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, met Senate leaders before travelling on to the United Nations in New York. During an hour's meeting with about 20 senators, Mr Arafat requested a review and repeal of laws that impeded or prevented economic or other relationships between the US and the PLO and repeated his strong commitment to peace. Mr George Mitchell, the Senate majority leader, said the general reaction among senators was to be helpful and that laws should be changed where necessary. In Israel last night the government said it would seal off the occupied Gaza Strip during the Jewish new year which begins today, in a move intended to allay mounting fears among Israelis about an increase in violence following the signing of the peace agreement. Two Palestinians died in further violence in the occupied Gaza Strip yesterday, including a suicide bomber who blew himself up in a police station in an apparent protest at the peace deal. In sharp contrast to Monday's ceremonials on the White House lawn, the Jordan agreement was initialled by Mr Elyakim Rubinstein, head of the Israeli delegation to the peace talks, and Mr Fayez Tarawneh, his Jordanian counterpart in the small Thomas Jefferson room in the State Department. The accord was described as an 'agenda' framing future negotiations towards an eventual peace treaty. After a modest affair of just over 10 minutes, the two signatories shook hands without hesitation or embarrassment. A draft text covering the outstanding issues between the two sides has been virtually ready to sign since last year. Jordan, however, delayed a final signing until progress had been made on the Palestinian-Israel negotiations. The document contains undertakings from both sides to refrain from threats to each other's security and sets out the main areas for future discussion - notably on water rights, minor border issues and the status of refugees. 'We hope this is just a first step, which will follow into an agreement based on comprehensive peace,' said Mr Tarawneh. The document calls for 'steps to arrive at a state of peace based on Security Council resolutions 242 and 338' - which demand an Israeli withdrawal from the territories occupied since the 1967 war - indicating that Jordan is not likely to sign a full peace deal with Israel until the Jewish state has done so with others. In Israel there were increasing signs yesterday that Mr Rabin would face an uphill struggle to win the parliamentary votes he says he needs to pass the peace agreement. Mr Arye Deri, leader of the ultra-orthodox Shas party, which has effectively quit the Labour-led coalition, said he had recommended the party's spiritual mentor to demand a referendum be held on the same day as local elections due on November 3. Mr Deri also said he had told the interior ministry, which he headed until yesterday, to prepare for a November referendum. So far there has been no government decision on a referendum. Arafat put to the test, says Rabin, Page 6 Edward Mortimer, Page 24</p>

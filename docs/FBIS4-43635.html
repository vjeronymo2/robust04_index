			<p>BFN     [Text] Brussels, June 21 (AFP) -- Some of France's partners  in the Western European Union (WEU) are prepared to provide  "logistical support" to a proposed French-led military  intervention to end ethnic bloodletting in Rwanda, WEU sources  said Tuesday [21 June].    The sources said Italy had again pledged to supply troops  for  the operation.    They added both commitments were conditional on the UN  Security Council endorsing the operation and on the  participation of African countries.</p>

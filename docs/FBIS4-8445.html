			<p>BFN     [Text] PRAGUE, April 13 (CTK) -- The intervention of NATO  air forces and UNPROFOR troops is being dictated by a bad  conscience for the past political incompetence of Western  governments, Jiri Holub, foreign policy secretary of the Liberal  Social Union [LSU] and former Czechoslovak Ambassador to Italy,  told journalists today.    The LSU is convinced that not all political means have been  applied, he said, adding that "we are harvesting the fruit of  the disintegration of Yugoslavia, which was a bad act." At the  beginning of the crisis there were several solutions such as  "democratization, democratic federalization and a confederative  set-up," Holub noted.    He also asked why Italy will not attend the forthcoming  presidential meeting in Litomysl and why Slovenia is being torn  out of the Balkan area. "If the presidential meeting is attended  by Germany and Slovenia, it should also be attended by Italy,"  he stressed.    LSU Chairman Frantisek Trnka cautioned that Czech-Slovak  relations were not developing favorably. He pointed to the  reluctance of the Czech Republic to hand over the shares of the  Czech Commercial Bank to which Slovakia has a legal right. He  called the obstructions politically wrong.</p>

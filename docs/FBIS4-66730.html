			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Muhammad al-'Ariqi: "Sanaa Has Not Bought Any </F> Prohibited Weapons Or Poisonous Gases"]    [Text] A responsible source in the General Committee of the  General People's Congress [GPC] has denied what has been said by  the [Yemeni] Socialist Party [YSP] about some responsible  agencies in Sanaa undertaking the purchase of prohibited weapons  and poisonous gases. The source was responding to accusations by  'Ali Salim al-Bid, the secretary general of the YSP, made when  he received the members of the National Dialogue Committee in  Aden. The source said that such statements tend to arouse  misgivings concerning the extent to which Yemen is committed to  international agreements, and the source demanded that the YSP  refute these statements.    In addition to this, GPC sources also denied news items  mentioned concerning elements of the forces loyal to 'Ali Nasir  Muhammad in Sanaa leaving their camps and joining the forces  that are serving the YSP. They described these news items as  fabricated and untrue. They said that the opposite is what  happened--that camps belonging to the military units located in  Sanaa and al-Bayda' have received hundreds of individuals who  have fled the camp of the Ba Suhayb Brigade in Dhamar and the  camp of the 3rd Brigade in 'Imran, in addition to a number of  recruits who had joined the military units located in Aden and  Shabwah which served the YSP. The GPC sources said that they  justified their desertion by saying that they were protesting  the actions of some of the YSP leaders who sought help from the  sultans who were fighting against the Yemeni revolution.    In addition to this, Yemeni newspapers yesterday said that a  clash occurred recently between the northern and southern forces  and that this resulted in five persons being killed in the  Shabwah area. However, a northern source vehemently denied this,  saying that what happened was a clash between two tribes, which  resulted in only two persons being killed.</p>

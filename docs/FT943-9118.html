			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / Canada to wind up insurer with British offshoot Canadian government regulators are to wind up the country's fourth biggest insurance company. They took control of Confederation Life Insurance, which had corporate assets of CDollars 19bn (Pounds 9bn) at the end of 1993, after the failure of protracted efforts to put together a bail-out package. Confed has 250,000 policyholders in the UK. Its British arm includes one of the biggest providers of pooled pension products to medium-sized companies, and Confederation Bank, which offers residential mortgage loans and deposit accounts. The Canadian government said it moved in the interests of policyholders, creditors and depositors, based on information that Confed's assets were not sufficient to provide 'adequate protection'. The 123-year-old mutual company is the latest victim of the slump in North American property markets. Confed's collapse is likely to accelerate the shake-up in Canada's overcrowded insurance market where margins have been squeezed by fierce competition. The company's offices in Canada and the UK will remain open for the time being. Canadian policyholders and depositors are partly covered by the insurance industry's consumer-protection fund, but are nonetheless expected to suffer losses. The UK arm said yesterday that it was conducting 'business as usual'. Confed disclosed earlier this week that it was in talks to sell the UK operations to an unidentified financial services group. The negotiations have been taken over by the Canadian regulators and are expected to be concluded shortly. Canada's superintendent of financial institutions took control of Confed late on Thursday. It will seek a court order to wind it up and liquidate its assets. The Canadian Life and Health Insurance Compensation Corporation, the industry's protection fund, said Confed would continue to pay death claims and retirement and disability benefits to Canadian policyholders. However, these will be subject to specified ceilings. Toronto-based Confed had sought an alliance for the past year with Great-West Life Assurance of Winnipeg, which would have included a CDollars 225m capital injection. The search for a rescuer was widened to a group of 10 Canadian and US insurers last month when it became apparent that the company required as much as CDollars 600m to survive. The group was unable to agree, however, on how to divide Confed's assets and liabilities. Confed suffered heavy capital losses as a result of commercial property lending during the 1980s. It wrote off CDollars 232m in loan losses in 1992 and 1993, but still has more than CDollars 800m of non-performing loans on its books. It had CDollars 33bn under management at the end of 1993.

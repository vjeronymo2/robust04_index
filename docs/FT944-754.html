The day's performance was strung about with all sorts of buying signals, dealers said, adding that were it not for the seasonally low level of activity the market could be expected to surge further. At the close of pit trading the March contract had reached 3,125, up 32 points for a five-day advance of 132 points. The premium to the cash market was 34 points, or 10 points above fair value. There was a limited amount of genuine buying during the morning session, but for the most part activity was nominal. Less than 4,000 contracts were traded up to the official 4.10pm close. In contrast, the traded options market had a busy day with 26,465 lots transacted. The main feature was the high proportion of call business. At 17,223 lots, calls outstripped puts by almost two-to-one, their best day since mid-October. The most active stock option was drugs group Glaxo at just under 2,000 contracts traded. Dealers said business was steady, with the recent strong rise in the cash market providing the spur. Wellcome, Hanson and Marks and Spencer were also actively traded.

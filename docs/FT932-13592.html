			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / International Company News: Channel tunnel contractor claims Dollars 360m BOMBARDIER, the international aerospace and transit equipment group, has lodged a CDollars 450m (USDollars 360m) claim with the prime contractor in the Channel tunnel project, which is to link Britain and France, to cover the cost of late design changes to 250 shuttle wagons it is building. The prime contractor, TransManche Link, comprising a group of construction companies, awarded Bombardier the CDollars 700m shuttle contract order three years ago. The equipment is being built by Bombardier's Eurorail unit in Europe. TML itself is in dispute with Eurotunnel, the Channel tunnel owner, over cost over-runs. Bombardier halted output of wagons at Eurorail's Bruges plant in Belgium nearly two months ago, saying it could not deliver because TML had not provided certification for the first 10 prototypes. Bombardier's claim is nearly twice industry estimates. Mr Laurent Baudoin, chairman, said the claim would be subject to arbitration. In the year ended last January, Bombardier earned C4132.8m, or 85 cents a share. This was up 23 per cent from CDollars 107.7m, or 73 cents, a year earlier. Revenues advanced to CDollars 4.4bn, against CDollars 3.1bn. The revenue increase partly reflected an acquisition. All parts of the business did better except transit equipment which posted a loss of CDollars 73m before tax. Fourth-quarter earnings were CDollars 42.1m, or 27 cents, against CDollars 37m, or 24 cents, a year earlier. Talisman Energy, formerly BP Canada, had first-quarter earnings of CDollars 7.9m, or 16 cents a share, against Dollars 2m, or 4 cents, a year earlier. Revenues were Dollars 63m, against Dollars 53.5m.</p>

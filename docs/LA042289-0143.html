			<p><P> April 22, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: BANKING / FINANCE  </P> <P> The last name of the spokesman for Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan in Irvine and its  parent firm should look familiar. It's Connally, as in John B. Connally, the  former Texas governor and presidential candidate.  </P> <P> The spokesman is the former politician's youngest son, Mark M. Connally. Before  taking on his new duties, the 36-year-old Connally worked for Lincoln's parent  firm, American Continental Corp., overseeing land development and loan  administration at its Tucson office for the last 2 years.  </P> <P> American Continental's chairman, the politically well-connected Charles H.  Keating Jr., served a short stint as campaign manager for the senior Connally's  presidential campaign in 1980.  </P></p>

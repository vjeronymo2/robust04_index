			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Tokyo welcomes discount rate cut: Bentsen predicts reduced trade surplus with US JAPAN'S business and political leaders yesterday gave a resounding welcome to the Bank of Japan's 0.75-point cut in the official discount rate, to 2.5 per cent, as an important step towards reviving the economy. The domestic welcome was amplified by Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US treasury secretary, who said the cut would be instrumental in whittling down Japan's trade surplus with the US. He said the cut would revive Japanese demand and 'help shrink Japan's very large external surplus, as well as strengthening world economic growth'. The Bank of Japan decided on the cut, the sixth consecutive cut since 1991, when the discount rate stood at 6 per cent, at an emergency meeting of its policy board yesterday morning. Mr Yasushi Mieno, bank governor, said the cut was justified because the adjustment of the economy after the collapse of the speculative bubble economy of the late-1980s had been much more severe than expected. He said other factors in the bank's decision included stable wholesale and consumer prices, the rising trade surplus and the recent sharp contraction in the money supply. The cut should help to stimulate bank lending and thus rekindle growth in the money supply. The bank had agreed on the cut only after intense pressure from its masters in the ruling Liberal Democratic party. Business leaders praised the long-awaited cut but immediately stressed that it needed to be followed by income tax cuts to stimulate depressed personal consumption. Mr Soichiro Toyoda, chairman of the car-maker, Toyota Motor, said an income tax cut should be introduced as soon as possible to lure consumers to resume spending. Mr Koehi Abe, of Chubu Electric Power, said the cut would have a limited impact unless there were further stimulative measures such as increased public works spending. Mr Takeshi Nagano, president of the Japan Federation of Employers' Associations, called on the government to take every measure it could to revive the economy if it sank further next month. Mr Yoshiro Hayashi, finance minister, said the priority was to pass the 1993 budget, which would increase overall spending by about 7 per cent. He said an income tax cut would not stimulate the economy. The ministry favours higher spending on public works. However, a task force set up by the LDP is expected to recommend soon an emergency fiscal package of about Y4,000bn (Pounds 21bn), including an income tax cut. Government ministers called on the commercial banks to pass on the official discount rate cut to lenders by lowering their short-term prime rates. It is thought the banks will consider a cut as early as next week. The long-heralded cut left the Tokyo equity and foreign exchange markets unmoved. The Nikkei stock average, which closed 35 points up on Wednesday, lost 31 points to 17,190 yesterday. The yen was almost unchanged, falling Y0.27 to Y124.6 against the US dollar in Tokyo.</p>

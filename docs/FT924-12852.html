			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Arts: The Rake rises from the ashes - Opera The final revival to join Glyndebourne's autumn tour is John Cox's celebrated staging of The Rake's Progress, designed by David Hockney. Revival is a misnomer in this case, for the original sets were nearly all destroyed in a fire. Their painstaking recreation has been overseen by Hockney, and the results seem brighter, crisper than ever. The production is once again a visual triumph, a glorious celebration of a great painter's art which enhances the work and adds to it further layers of allusion. Hogarth filtered through Hockney's own graphic techniques, just as Stravinsky's music distilled his classical models ' to become designer's opera in the very best sense. In its dramatic and musical recreation too the evening is immensely rewarding. Cox's elegant, intelligent production has been revived by Aidan Lang with care and subtle understanding; its virtues seemed even more precious after suffering the inanities of the Aix Rake only ten weeks ago. There is nothing heavy-handed about Cox's approach, no jolts as it pans between panoramic satire and close-focussed pain; the tours de force of the brothel and auction scenes owe just as much to the thoughtful direction as to the virtuoso design. Ivor Bolton conducts a vivid, scrupulously drilled account; a hint of rushing in the early numbers was soon controlled, and the rest of the score moved easily and naturally. There is fine, exuberant chorus work and a cast without notifiable weaknesses. Anne Dawson's Anne Trulove takes a determined middle path between resilient independence on the one hand and mawkish sweetness on the other; her singing is firm-toned and most accurately placed. Barry Banks's Tom began unprepossessingly but gained steadily in confidence and the flexibility of his phrasing; the Bedlam scene was movingly managed. Steven Page's Nick Shadow is well timed and consistently sinister, a little too much the pantomime villain momentarily, though judged nicely in the end. Fiona Kimm's Baba the Turk, adorning Glyndebourne Touring's posters for many weeks now, is a gem, sung without parody and vividly acted; her farewell scene with Anne was touching. The remainder ' John Hall's Trulove, Angela Hickey's Mother Goose, Andrew Yeats's Sellem ' are also fitted tellingly into the scheme, in which every element is perfectly weighted and postioned. The whole production is one of the highpoints of British opera in the last decade and more, and once again should been seen, savoured and saluted. The Rake's Progress: Glyndebourne Touring Opera at Sadler's Wells. Further performances tonight, October 22 and 24, then on tour to Plymouth, Sheffield, Southampton, Manchester and Oxford b</p>

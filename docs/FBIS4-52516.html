			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 10 KYODO -- Business leaders urged Prime  Minister Tsutomu Hata to pass the overdue fiscal 1994 budget  quickly in the Diet and take measures to help small and  medium-size businesses suffering from the recession.    They also separately appealed to Hata to redistrict for a  new  single-seat electoral system under a Diet-approved overhaul of  the current multiseat electoral system.    Hata replied the tasks must be done and will draw  international criticism if they are not.    The business leaders were Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the  Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren), Masaru Hayami,  president of the Japan Association of Corporate Executives  (Keizai Doyukai) and Kosaku Inaba, chairman of the Japan Chamber  of Commerce and Industry.    Hiraiwa also told Hata the government should try to keep the  yen-dollar rate at an appropriate level and promote political,  administrative and economic reforms.    Hayami asked Hata to follow the reform-oriented policies  pursued by former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and appealed  for a national election under a new electoral system after  summer.</p>

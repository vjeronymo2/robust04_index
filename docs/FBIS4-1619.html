			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on "exclusive" interview with Lu Xueyi (7120 1331 </F> 5669), National People's Congress deputy and noted sociologist,  by reporters Zhang Hong (1728 4767) and Liu Hongtao (0491 3163  3447); date, place not given]    [Text] Beijing, 22 Mar (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- In an  exclusive interview with these reporters, Lu Xueyi, National  People's Congress deputy and noted sociologist, pointed out: In  the relationship among reform, development, and stability, it is  stability that should be put in the first place. At present,  special precautions should be taken against the trends of  soaring prices, boasting and exaggeration, and corruption, as  well as against the massive flood of migrant workers.    Lu said: Judging by the price increases in the first two  months of this year, it will be very difficult to keep this  year's price increase index below 10 percent. For this reason,  it is absolutely necessary to keep down the scale of capital  construction and the growth rate; we should not be impatient.  Provided China can maintain an annual progressive growth rate  of 9 percent, and even 7 percent in the future, its absolute  economic strength will reach the world standard quickly.  According to his analysis, the problem this year will focus on  commodity prices. If the increase rate can be contained within  a double-digit figure, there will not be big problem. It is  only the peasants, the unemployed urban workers, and young  people who have just joined the work force who will be hard up.    Lu pointed out: There is a very serious trend of boasting  and exaggeration going on. He cast doubts on the credibility of  some important statistical figures. He took up a list of last  year's total industrial output indices from various localities,  saying that, calculated in terms of comparable prices, the  township industrial enterprises in 10 provinces registered a  growth rate of 60 and even 100 percent. He said: How was this  possible? China has come to grief on account of boasting and  exaggeration. He said: If we are not clear about our rice  output last year, there will be problems when we need rice, but  it is unavailable.    Lu said: According to an anticorruption report by the  procuratorate, some 110,000 cadres at or above the  department-head level have economic or other problems. This  represents a large proportion of in-service cadres at or above  the department-head level in China. The public, however, does  not know this proportion; There are a lot of complaints against  the public security organs, procuratorial organs, and people's  courts. If we fail to step up supervision over law enforcement,  it will adversely affect social stability.    Lu said: Now people have eventually come to realize that  civilian workers play an irreplaceable positive role in economic  construction and have stopped calling them "blind migrant  workers." For this reason, it is necessary to guide them and  ameliorate their situation. It is not good for the economy to  grow either too rapidly or too slowly. If it grows too slowly,  many of the capital construction projects will have to be  stopped and the civilian workers will be the first to bear the  brunt, which is likely to cause social instability.</p>

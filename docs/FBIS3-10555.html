			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada has also  commented on the clashes that occurred in Chapare. During a  news conference, the president commented on the drug trafficking  issue. He said Bolivia and his administration are coexisting  with a time bomb because Law 1008 obliges the government to  eradicate 1 hectare of coca for every cocaine maceration pit  that is found. He said this is the cause of the problems.    [Begin Sanchez de Lozada recording] This causes the problem:  We have been finding large production centers of cocaine base,  which is purchased by the main cocaine producers who transform  this base into cocaine. This concerns us. [end recording]    Asked if his administration will defend coca production, he  said:    [Begin Sanchez de Lozada recording] Of course we will defend  it. Coca is part of our society. It is a consumer product, but  we cannot protect coca production in the Chapare region where it  is grown exclusively for drug production, for cocaine  production. You know very well that if you offer Chapare coca  leaves to miners, they will refuse to chew them. Miners and  peasants only chew coca grown in Yungas. This, however, is no  reason to simply eradicate this coca and fill our country with  violence. We must find solutions to this problem and these  solutions can only be found through dialogue. Pressure from  abroad is great and domestic damage is also great. We cannot  forget that Bolivia is already beginning to have (?addicts) and  drug consumption problems. Cocaine base is a very bad drug.  [end recording]</p>

			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: London &amp; Provincial The UK mortgage debenture market took heart from yesterday's deal allowing holders of the Pounds 135m London &amp; Provincial Shop Centres issue to exit for 95p in the pound. That was much more than many had expected, but it would be rash to conclude that a similar outcome awaits investors in any future defaults. The size of the payment to stockholders depended on the skill and determination of large institutions in negotiating with Citibank, the company's main banker. Citibank is acquiring the mortgage property at less than its 'willing buyer' valuation but it is taking substantial additional risk. It could hardly recover the price if it were compelled to sell in today's depressed market. Other bankers in a similar position will see in yesterday's market relief a good reason for being less generous. The true lessons from London &amp; Provincial are, first, that defaults can happen and, second, that better arrangements are needed to protect stockholders when the value of the security starts to fall. Law Debenture Trust, the trustee in this case, has been far too passive. It argues that an earlier valuation of security would not have been in stockholders' interest, because it might have led to a receivership. But its concept of stockholder interests is a subjective one, resting heavily on confidential exchanges of information with the borrower. Trustees need a better defined role giving them clout and the obligation to exercise it if they are to help make the market a safer place.</p>

			<p><P> August 3, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE;  </P> <P> CHINESE WON'T SEEK ASYLUM  </P> <P> Eight members of a Chinese opera company who disappeared in San Francisco last  week just days before they were scheduled to return home will not seek  political asylum in the United States, Alan Chow, executive director of the  Chinese American Arts Council in New York City, said. He said the performers  from the Shanghai Kun Opera had not realized the implications of their actions  and were frightened by newspaper publicity. "They don't realize what they did,"  said Chow, adding that he was angry the entertainers had not contacted him  before they acted. "If they wanted to stay in the U.S. they should have gone  the legal way." Chow, who has had no direct contact with the eight since they  left New York, said he heard from friends that the group probably would not  apply for asylum. Chow said he believes the performers are hiding with friends,  four in San Francisco, two in New York City and two in Washington. immigration  and FBI officials reported no contact with the group.  </P></p>

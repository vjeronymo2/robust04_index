			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed ARS: "Netherlands Prime Minister Lubbers </F> Returns Early From Indonesia"; as released by The Hague ANP  Database]    [Text] Surabaya, 6 Apr (ANP) -- Netherlands Prime Minister  Ruud Lubbers will cut short his Indonesian trip and return to  the Netherlands Wednesday evening to participate in the debate  on the Interregional Research Team. By so doing, Lubbers is  complying with the express wish of the Chamber that the prime  minister, in addition to Justice Minister Ernst Hirsch Ballin  and Interior Minister Ed van Thijn, attend its debate on the  matter. Consequently, the originally limited four-day visit by  the prime minister will be further shortened by one day.    According to the Netherlands prime minister, there is no  reason for the Indonesians to feel offended at his early  departure. He said he was convinced that he had managed to  explain this clearly to his hosts.</p>

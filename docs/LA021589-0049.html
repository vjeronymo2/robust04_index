			<p><P> February 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'LAWRENCE' RESTORED: NOTHING CAN TOUCH IT  </P> <P> From the suppressed excitement in its overture to the last moments as that  prophetic motorcyclist overtakes Lawrence's open car in the desert, David  Lean's "Lawrence of Arabia" (Cineplex Odeon, Century City), restored to its  full clarity and magnificence, is one of the Seven Wonders of the cinematic  world.  </P> <P> Nothing to come along since "Lawrence's" release in 1962 has diminished the  power of cameraman F.A. (Freddie) Young's desert vistas. Stretched out in  70-millimeter Super Panavision vastness, the movie's most pungent memory has  lost nothing to time as a shimmering pin point in the center of the screen  becomes clearer and clearer and can finally be read as a man, all in black, on  camelback, riding straight toward the camera. It's still the greatest actor's  entrance in movies, the one that launched Omar Sharif into American moviegoing  consciousness.  </P> <P> But Lean never makes haunting pictures for their own sake; he uses scale to  sculpt character, and as our themes shrink along with our screens, the joy of  storytelling on this epic scale is thrilling. It couldn't have been an easy  story to shape. Thomas Edward Lawrence was a scholar, a soldier, a hero with  notable flaws and a man whom Lowell Thomas said had "a genius for backing into  the limelight."  </P> <P> In his literate, subtle screenplay from Lawrence's autobiography, "The Seven  Pillars of Wisdom," Robert Bolt has kept all of Lawrence's complexities: his  reticences and his flair for bravura; his compassion and the blood lust that  came on him after his capture by a Turkish Bey at Deraa. And in fleshing out  the man, Peter O'Toole has fatally colored our vision of Lawrence; the 5-foot-4  "El Aurens" will forever live as a 6-foot 2 gold-blond demigod.  </P> <P> What has changed? We're finally able to take O'Toole's unwavering charisma for  granted and look beyond him to the film's uncommonly compassionate and shaded  portrayal of these Arab leaders. They emerge as proud, brave, ancient,  honorable: Alec Guinness' elegantly ironic Prince Feisel or Sharif's firebrand  Sherif Ali, fascinating alternatives to the all-purpose villainy that has been  the Arabs' lot on screen for so long. The intensity of Lawrence's exchanges  with these sinuous, seductive men make us forget completely that it is a film  without women.  </P> <P> Bolt has been only moderately successful in explaining what was taking place  historically: a revolt by the Arabs against the occupying Turks during World  War I. Bolt is better at laying out Lawrence's passion to create an Arab  nation.  </P> <P> Bolt and Lean are best at change-ups, at shifting down from scenic vastness to  intimate, highly charged moments between two or three characters. Wonderful  vignettes emerge: Claude Raines at his Cheshire-cat best as the foreign office  politician Dryden; Jack Hawkins' shrewdly manipulative Gen. Allenby, and Jose  Ferrer's indelible Turkish Bey, whose beating of Lawrence reveals to the  Englishman two sides to himself that he finds unendurable: a human side and a  streak of masochism.  </P> <P> That last trait, of pleasure in punishing his body, has been hinted at in a  reinstated early, crucial scene between Lawrence and his fellow  soldier-cartographers in Cairo. Sliding his fingers up a match to put it out,  Lawrence says: "Of course it hurts. The trick is not minding that it hurts."  </P> <P> There's a slyness to the film makers' presentation of Lawrence; twice, they set  off his superhuman accomplishments with scenes in which a detached observer  catches him when he believes himself utterly alone. As he runs to float his  silken sheik's robes, given by Sharif as a measure of homage, and to catch his  reflection in his dagger, we move sideways to see his preening, mortifyingly,  from the point of view of Anthony Quinn, as Auda Abu Tayi, sardonic leader of  an opposing tribe.  </P> <P> The film, now 3 hours and 36 minutes long (rated PG, because its language is  pure although its scenes are sometimes bloody), is in two unequal halves. The  action before the intermission is the upward arc of Lawrence's life, the second  half is his tragic unraveling, documented by Arthur Kennedy's Jackson Bentley,  a correspondent and resident ugly American.  </P> <P> The first half ends after Lawrence has pulled off a seeming military  impossibility, crossing the oven-like Nefud desert and capturing the Turkish  stronghold of Aqaba. Lawrence's return is a moment of unabashed theater -- Gen.  Allenby conferring with his filthy, burnoose-clad lieutenant, equal to equal.  It's a little embarrassing to discover how deeply satisfying the scene is.  </P> <P> The shorter second half, as Lawrence's illusions are stripped from him, is  almost unendurably painful and oddly unsatisfying. Here, the great visual  moments are invariably connected with suffering, like the scene in Allenby's  quarters when Lawrence's wounds at the hands of the Turks bleed through his  jacket. This stigmata is an eerie, almost Shakespearean device, a bloody  witness to his "weakness."  </P> <P> In the year after its debut, "Lawrence's" overwhelming authority collared seven  Academy Awards -- best picture, director, (color) cinematography, (color) art  direction, sound, editing and music. Although it seems shocking that O'Toole  and Sharif were omitted, now we can also be grateful for its artful and  resourceful restorers, Robert Harris and Jim Painten, to Columbia Pictures and  the quartet of Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, Jon Davison and Dawn Steel,  who supported the complex restoration.  </P> <P> 'LAWRENCE OF ARABIA'  </P> <P> A Columbia Pictures presentation of the Sam Spiegel-David Lean production.

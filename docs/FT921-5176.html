			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading TRADING in the derivatives market remained directionless and volatile as the lack of economic or political data gave little on which to focus, writes Joel Kibazo. Stock index futures opened at 2,580, and an initial setback in the March contract on the FT-SE was followed by a slight squeeze sending March to 2,582, the high of the day. However, buying interest faded after that initial run, leaving the contracts to drift lower to reach 2,567, its lowest point. The firm opening on Wall Street saw interest in the contract return and a brief rally was attempted, but New York's retreat soon put paid to further advances. Dealers talked of sizeable rolling into the June contract and out of March. March ended at 2,569, just two points above estimated fair value premium to cash of around six. Turnover at around 4,500 contracts, included over 1,000 contracts traded in June. In traded options business was dull and turnover totalled 23,702 contracts. The FT-SE 100 Index option traded 5,331 lots, part of which was attributed to one house unwinding a big call spread. BP was the busiest stock option trading 1622 contracts.</p>

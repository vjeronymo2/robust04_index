			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / Smith 'incandescent' as Speaker reprieves Scott Mr Nicholas Scott, the minister who admitted misleading parliament in a debate on rights for the disabled, yesterday won a reprieve from the speaker of the Commons after she decided not to refer his case for disciplinary action. Miss Betty Boothroyd, the Speaker, told MPs she would not initiate an inquiry by the Commons Privileges Committee into whether Mr Scott had been 'in contempt' of the House during a debate last week. Downing Street officials hoped the ruling would end pressure on the social security minister to resign. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, was reported to be 'incandescent' that Mr Scott had appeared to lie to the Commons without losing his post. A spokesman for Mr Smith said he regarded the case as 'one of the clearest indications yet of how little public accountability there is in John Major's government'. In a letter to Mr Smith, the prime minister firmly backed Mr Scott. 'I now consider the matter closed,' he said. In reply, Mr Smith referred to the affair as 'a squalid episode'. Tory MPs said the government's image had been dented by claims that the minister had used 'dirty tricks' to defeat a bill to improve rights for disabled workers. Mr Scott apologised to the Commons on Tuesday for saying that his department had had 'no part whatsoever' in helping Tory backbenchers draw up the amendments that had scuppered the bill. Several Labour MPs criticised the ruling, saying Mr Scott had lied to the House. Downing Street officials stressed that Mr Scott had 'inadvertently' misled parliament, and had not been in full possession of the facts relating to the amendments during last Friday's debate. But as ministerial colleagues rallied to his defence, Mr Scott's daughter Victoria, who works for the Royal Association for Disability and Rehabilitation, accused the government of 'lying' over the bill. 'I have spoken to him (Mr Scott) and I hope to talk about it again,' she said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme. 'I am very angry with him on behalf of 6.5m disabled people, but we remain very good friends.'</p>

			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Sport: More power to your right foot - Motor Racing / The Formula One year is building to a finale which will be decided by driver skill Bizarre as it may seem the outcome of this year's Formula One world championship, still the technological pinnacle of motor racing, may prove to have rested on the thickness of a short plank. Made of wood, bolted to the underside of the Benetton-Ford of current championship leader Michael Schumacher - as it is every grand prix car  - its purpose is to make the cars ride higher and thus lose some of the downforce which has allowed them to corner at G-forces for which most circuits had never been designed. The plank forms a small part of the intended safety dividend from that black day in May when the late Ayrton Senna's Williams-Renault speared tragically, and still not wholly explicably, into the unyielding concrete wall of Imola's infamous Tamburello curve. Had the plank under Schumacher's Benetton been a few millimetres thicker when it was measured by race officials at the end of the Belgium grand prix, he might be watching tomorrow's Portuguese round from the sidelines reasonably confident that Damon Hill had little chance of challenging his lead in the four remaining grands prix. Schumacher would have had that confidence even though at the Estoril circuit he will be sitting out the second race of a two-race ban for ignoring the stewards' black flag for a misdemeanour in the British grand prix at Silverstone. Instead, the plank's missing millimetres, bringing the car closer to the ground and thus making it more aerodynamically effective, were construed by officials as more than could be explained by scraping over the kerbs. Schumacher lost all his points for first place. If Hill takes his Renault-Williams to victory tomorrow, as he has vowed he will, the young German's lead will have been cut to just one point. In the season's final three races Schumacher will have to cope not just with Hill and the other rivals who he has outpaced so easily this season , but the fiercely competitive former FI and IndyCar champion Nigel Mansell. At 41 Mansell, returning from IndyCars to his old Renault-Williams seat, has something to prove. Currently enduring media taunts that he is over the hill, he will almost certainly prove Schumacher's most formidable challenger. Benetton was also fined in connection with the black flag incident. It has been involved in disputes with the authorities over its in-car computer software and its pit-stop refuelling equipment. There is a risk that for both Benetton and Schumacher a season which began as a tour de force may end as fiasco. If so, it will be a debacle for Benetton only. Spectators, media and sponsors, are more likely to relish an exciting fight to the finish. Better yet, this season's rule changes, embracing a 'technology ban', and safety changes, are having an almost entirely positive effect on grand prix as competition and spectacle. It may still not offer the wheel-banging closeness of touring car racing, but the huge technology advantage of leading teams has been much diminished. In particular, the banning of traction control, that odious computer device which limited power to the rear wheels while accelerating out of a corner, has tilted the balance of power firmly back to the driver's right foot. No longer is he protected by technology from his own over-eagerness. Recently, we have witnessed even the demi-gods pirouetting into the gravel-traps as they re-learn the traction control through human perception and reflexes. There are those who argue that the traction control ban is a step backwards in terms of safety, and perhaps it is. But balancing power against available tyre grip is one of the most fundamental of racing driving skills. Its absence had served to diminish a sport which, by its very essence, can never be wholly safe. The changes have also helped brave and skilful drivers escape from the relative obscurity of the middle pack. No-one, for example, could fail to be impressed by Ukyo Katayama thrusting the Tyrell-Yamaha team back to prominence and harassing even the Williams-Renaults in the most recent grand prix, at Monza. The hard-charging of Rubens Barrichello with the Jordan-Hart and Ferrari, with Jean Alesi and the ever-cheerful Gerhard Berger, are also beneficiaries of the levelling of the technological playing field. With Estoril the latest circuit to have corners tamed and run-off areas increased, tomorrow's drama should be confined to the race itself. It should nevertheless contain plot and texture enough for the most demanding aficionado. In the past few days, Hill and Schumacher have re-signed for their teams. Their immediate futures are assured. But the young Scot, David Coulthard, who must give up his Williams seat to Mansell for the last three grands prix, will be out to prove that it is he, not Mansell, who deserves to drive alongside Hill next year. He pressed Hill hard at Monza and will probably do so again tomorrow. Hill himself is uncomfortably aware of a growing tide of 'Coulthard is faster' comment. The coming months for the likeable Hill will be uncomfortable indeed if tomorrow Coulthard remains behind him only on the basis of team orders. Neither will gain much relief from Ferrari. Alesi, after leading so easily at Monza until mechanical failure intervened, lusts for his first win. Trying hardest of all will be Johnny Herbert. It has been a miserable couple of seasons with Lotus for the undoubtedly rapid Englishman. Lotus' deteriorating financial position led at last to the appointment of administrators a few days ago. Ironically, this coincided with the arrival of new Mugen-Honda engines. At Monza Herbert headed even the Williams cars away from the start. The brief challenge was ended by a collision with the fiery Irishman, Eddy Irvine. But if Herbert can prove tomorrow, in front of several potential sponsors, that Monza was no flash in the pan he may save not only his own career - but Lotus itself.</p>

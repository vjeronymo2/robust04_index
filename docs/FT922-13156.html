			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Backward in coming forward to claim cash - In a Nutshell Small businesses frequently complain about how slowly their customers settle debts but they are reluctant to do anything about it. Eighty per cent of small businesses have suffered cash flow problems as a result of being owed money but only 20 per cent take action to pursue this money within 10 days, according to a survey* by REL Consultancy Group. More than half waited until the money was at least two weeks overdue before making contact with the debtor while three quarters continued supplying customers who were at least 30 days late. Half of the respondents to the survey never employed a third party such as a debt collection agency to recover a debt. *The Impact of Overdue Debt on Investment and Capital Expenditure.

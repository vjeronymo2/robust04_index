			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading HEAVY selling of the June Footsie futures contract not only boosted turnover but led to the day's big fall in the underlying equities market, writes Joel Kibazo. Having opened at 2,884, June went into retreat with a leading US house said to have led the way with a big selling order. Further selling was seen by UK holders convinced there was unlikely to be a cut in UK base rates. Attempts at a rally were seen following the 11.30am release of favourable UK economic data, but this soon petered out leaving June to continue to slide. The poor opening on Wall Street was seen as a cue for further selling and the contract fell to the day's low of 2,845 in the last hour of trading. It finished at 2,850, down 43 and at a slight discount to the underlying cash market. Turnover at 14,984 was heavy. Trading in British Steel mainly by Kleinwort Benson was the main feature in the traded options. By the close volume in the stock was 19,115. Total turnover was a hefty 52,354 lots.</p>

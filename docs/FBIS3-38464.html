The contenders in the final ballot are the candidate from  the right (with 32.8 percent of the votes) and the candidate  from the center (26.3 percent).    These are surprise results in the provincial elections in  Catania. Little more than six months after the choice of Enzo  Bianco as "progressive" mayor of Palermo, the city has suddenly  turned its back against the left, placing on the final ballot  the National Alliance candidate Nello Musumeci and the Pact for  Italy politician Stello Maugiameli. Rejected with no chance of  appeal are Andrea Scudieri (PDS [Democratic Party of the Left],  Communist Renewal, AD [Democratic Alliance], Rete, and the  Greens) and Maurizio Pellegrino (socialist and PDS circles plus  League).    National Alliance leader Gianfranco Fino is exultant: "This  is the proof that we are not destined to fall into the hands of  the left." Satisfied too are [Pact for Italy leader] Mario  Segni, [Italian Republican Party Secretary] Giorgio La Malfa,  and the CCD [Democratic Christian Center] neocentrists. Tolling  the death knell, for the left, [PDS Secretary] Achille Occhetto  recited a late "mea culpa." "We should not be disheartened, but  work hard, because the battle will be a hard one."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Nanchang, April 6 (XINHUA) -- Ten years ago, a  person who left a state-owned unit to join a township or private  business would soon become a local celebrity described as daring  to "swim" in China's economic reform.    But now, taking the dive has become a daily occurrence.    Last year, tens of thousands of technicians in economically  strong east China broke their "iron rice bowls" and found jobs  in enterprises not run by the state.    Experts held the enforcement of retirement insurance as one  of the determining factors in this conceptual revolution, as  people in collective or private businesses can also draw old-age  pensions.    It is a far cry from the old labor insurance regulations,  which were drawn up in the early 1950s and providing that only  the staff in state enterprises could enjoy free medical  treatment and old-age pensions.    So far, 85 million employees throughout the country have  taken out the new retirement insurance.    The new system, under which premiums are shared between the  government, employers and retirees, has covered more than  500,000 businesses, giving benefits to 17 million retirees.    In 1990, trial operation of the new pension insurance  started  in Nanchang, capital of east China's Jiangxi Province.    Seeing its initial success, over 300 cities have followed  suit.    As early as three years ago, over 90 percent of Nanchang's  enterprises and 500,000 people were included in the system.    Now, about 90,000 persons have retired on an annual pension  of 20 million yuan raised in the new way.    People welcome the new rules, for they have removed or  reduced an obstacle to changing jobs.    Statistics show that from January to August last year, 70  percent of over 10,000 job hunters in Nanchang city streamed  into non-state firms. And more than 3,000 engineers and  managers flowed to township businesses in Zhejiang Province.    Even people in state-owned enterprises have realized that  the  system can help them hold the "iron rice bowl" more firmly.    For example, workers in the Nanchang No. 1 Linen Textile  Factory, which suffered losses for several successive years,  have had a hard time, while the retired can obtain full pension  from the municipal social insurance bureau.    Xiong Xiaofeng, an official with the city's labor bureau,  surmised that China's fast developing market economy has  necessitated the system.    At present, the insurance sector in Nanchang has extended  into such areas as unemployment, maternity and industrial injury  coverage.    Last year, the city paid two million yuan in compensation to  900 lying-in women, people injured on the job and people out of  work.    Xiong said that there is a long way to go for China to set  up  a sound insurance system, to relieve the heavy financial burden  on enterprises which have to cover big-number medical bills and  old-age pensions for their employees.</p>

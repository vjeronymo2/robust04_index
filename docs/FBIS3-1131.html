			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report]  <H6>  THE STAR </H6>   DP, NP Unable To Penetrate Black Electorate Market -- Paul  Pereira, who is public affairs manager of the South African  Institute of Race Relations, writes in an article in the  "Election Watchdog" column on page 12 of Johannesburg THE STAR  in English on 21 March, that "the chances of the traditionally  white National and Democratic parties penetrating the black  electoral market in any substantial way seem slim." The  Democratic Party's (DP) attempts this week to hold public  meetings on western Cape tertiary campuses "were disrupted by  ANC [African National Congress] supporters, echoing the  disruptions last year of DP meetings in Khayelitsha and  Gugulethu as well as the more recent disruptions of NP [National  Party] road shows." "Natal, in which Africans constitute 81  percent of the population (including kwaZulu) is another area  where the traditionally white parties have to contend with  `no-go' areas." "Amidst all the attention being focused on  events in Bophuthatswana, East Rand violence, and constitutional  negotiations, we could lose sight of the predicaments of the  Democratic and National parties. These two traditionally white  parties are, in some of South Africa's most populous areas,  being denied a hearing."    Only `Reasonably' Free, Fair Election Expected -- In the  "One  in Your Eye" column on the same page, Kaizer Nyatsumba, asks:  "Will the election be free and fair? I don't think so. Given  the very high degree of political intolerance in our society, it  is impossible that we can have a free and fair election.  Instead, we should now hope for a reasonably free  and fair election -- and we would be lucky to have even that.  But, realistically, that is what is within the realm of  possibility at the moment. Although ANC members have been the  guiltiest, not many parties have clean hands in this regard."  <H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>   De Klerk `Dereliction of Duty' in Third Force Claims --  Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 21 March in a page-14  editorial says ANC President Nelson Mandela and his colleagues  "accuse De Klerk of personal and direct responsibility for the  deaths of black people" by an alleged "third force". However,  BUSINESS DAY disagrees, saying "De Klerk's refusal over the  years to give sufficient attention to the possible existence of  a third force does not add up to that kind of culpability."  However, the De Klerk government appears guilty of "a gross  dereliction of duty." Despite the available evidence "it failed  to recognise the potential dangers posed by its secret police  force which, after all, was trained to see opponents of  apartheid as enemies to be fought ruthlessly." De Klerk has  also "ignored numerous calls" for the replacement of General  Johan van der Merwe as commissioner of police "because of doubts  about his commitment to the political process. The President  has put in political charge of the police force first Adriaan  Vlok and then Hernus Kriel -- two hawks unwilling to attempt to  seek out the rote which now threatens the creadibilit of the  entire force."    ANC's `Selective Conscience' on Controls, Discipline -- A  second editorial on the same page finds its "encouraging" that  the ANC "is taking such a tough stance on financial discipline.  The party has joined in the lambasting of self-governing  territories for overspending and is pushing for a fiscal control  mechanism that will apply to central government too." ANC  deputy head of economics, Tito Mboweni, "wants to make sure `the  family silver is still there when the new administration takes  over'." "Let us hope the family silver is treated with the same  respect once the new administration has taken over," remarks  BUSINESS DAY. "The ANC has already shown that it has a  selective conscience on controls and discipline. It had no  qualms in asking that import duties on election materials be  waived, and to use finrands to buy a building. Those playing  watchdog now should be watched in future with equal vigilance."  <H6>  SOWETAN </H6>   Enough Evidence of `Third Force' -- "The Goldstone  Commission  has uncovered massive SAP [South African Police] and kwaZulu  police involvement in the arming and training of large numbers  of men on the Reef and Natal," states a page-8 editorial in  Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 21 March. "Even State  President F.W. de Klerk admitted that there was enough evidence  of a Third Force being instrumental in the taking of thousands  of lives during the past four years. It is fortunate that these  revelations come a few weeks before the elections. Heads must  roll and De Klerk's previous timid attempts to clean the deadly  mess must be given teeth."</p>

			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> NIELSEN CRASHES 'HOUSE PARTY'  </P> <P> So how's Steve Doocy doing on his new syndicated show, "House Party"?  </P> <P> Don't ask. The magazine show, which is seen on stations owned by NBC and Group  W (it's a joint production of NBC productions and Group W), debuted the week of  Jan. 22.  </P> <P> But that's the good news for Steve. In Los Angeles, "House Party" airs at 10  a.m. on KNBC, right after reruns of "The Golden Girls" and "227." This past  Monday, "House Party" averaged a 0.3 rating and a 1% share of the Los Angeles.  audience at that hour. Tuesday, it shot up to a 1.5-7.  </P> <P> On Monday, in Chicago, it averaged a 1.4-4 on NBC-owned WMAQ following "Santa  Barbara" in the afternoon. Tuesday, it averaged a 0.8-2. And in Indianapolis  the ratings are so low, they don't meet "minimum reporting standards" for the  Nielsen count. "House Party," which has signed on for a 13-week run, airs in 11  of Nielsen's 23 big-city markets. So far it has averaged a 2.0-8 in those major  markets.  </P></p>

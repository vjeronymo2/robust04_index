			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Poles' fear of future obscures past: Christopher Bobinski and Anthony Robinson on support for parties with communist roots POLISH voters seem poised to legitimise the discredited Communist party's re-named 'social democratic' successors, only four years after the Solidarity movement inflicted a humiliating electoral defeat on the ruling Communist party. If the opinion polls are to be believed, a clutch of left-wing parties with their roots in the communist past are expected to be the main gainers in Poland's third post-communist era elections on September 19. The Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) led by Mr Alexander Kwasniewski, a former communist who played a key role in negotiations with Solidarity four years ago, is within sight of overtaking Solidarity's main successor party, the Democratic Union (UD) as the largest single party. The SLD's rural equivalent, the Polish Peasant Party (PSL), is achieving similar success in garnering votes from a disgruntled rural population which still makes up 40 per cent of the Polish electorate. The strength of the left contrasts with confusion and division among the anti-communist right and the former Solidarity parties. The implications for Poland's international standing and economic health provoked Mr Leszek Balcerowicz, the non-party economist widely regarded as the author of Poland's painful but successful shock therapy reform programme, to warn this week that Poles should beware 'the parties of printing easy money' and vote for those who made Poland's private enterprise revolution possible. These include the free market Liberal Democratic Congress (KLD) led by Jan Krzysztof Bielecki, a former prime minister, which is most threatened by the leftward shift indicated by the polls. The renewed attractiveness of the left reflects fears that, despite rising industrial production and predictions that Poland will achieve the highest rate of economic growth in Europe this year, unemployment will continue to rise beyond an already high 15 per cent. The leftward tilt also comes as memories of past privations under the communists fade and are replaced by anxiety that the future will bring the dismantling of the welfare net and limited access to free schooling and health facilities. This is all in contrast to the last general elections in 1991 when it was the fractious right-wing parties, with their populist, reflationary economic slogans, which won enough of the protest vote to be able to form a short-lived government led by Mr Jan Olszewski. Now these groups, which are suspicious of foreign investment and want to purge former communists from public life, are also struggling - along with their liberal and free market KLD rivals - to cross the new 5 per cent barrier introduced to limit the proliferation of small parties which characterised the last parliament. The strength of the PSL in the countryside underlines one of the ironies of post-communist Poland. The deeply Roman Catholic and conservative small farmers who made life so difficult for the communists now look back with nostalgia to the old days of meat shortages in the shops and guaranteed prices for farmers: they have suffered a steep fall in income because of competition from subsidised EC imports. All this leaves the Democratic Union (UD) as the only mainstream party with its origins in Solidarity in a position to challenge the regressive trend. This is partly to do with the personal popularity of Ms Hanna Suchocka, who emerged from relative political obscurity in July 1992 to become prime minister. The UD hopes that her popularity will help the party capture about 20 per cent of the votes, the most any party can hope for in Poland's still fragmented political scene. The strength of personal support for Ms Suchocka has turned the election campaign into something of a 'beauty contest' between the outgoing prime minister and President Lech Walesa, the once charismatic leader of Solidarity. Mr Walesa's new bid to secure a strong personal power base by promoting his so-called 'Non-Party Movement for Reform' (BBWR) does not appear to have made many converts. The movement, which was formed in July, won an initial 10 per cent support in the polls but appears to have lost momentum. Much is at stake for the president. If his movement fails to overcome the 5 per cent hurdle (or 8 per cent for coalitions) it would place a question mark over his chances of re-election in the 1995 presidential race. But, mindful of the criticism which followed his promise during the presidential campaign two years ago that privatisation would leave every Pole Dollars 10,000 better off, Mr Walesa is no longer promising miracles. This unwillingness to make rash promises is indeed a general characteristic of this campaign, partly at least because many of the politicians taking part have had the sobering experience of taking part in government over the past four years. This has given them direct knowledge of the constraints imposed by powerful external bodies such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, and awareness of the dangers inflation would bring if monetary policies are eased too much. What is significant is that the broad unspoken consensus in favour of continuing with market reforms means that the main outlines of the economic policies of the past four years are not directly challenged by any party. Even the post communist SLD talks of the need to keep the budget deficit to around the 5 per cent of gross domestic product required by the IMF, although the rural PSL and the anti-communist Confederation for an Independent Poland (PKN), with their suspicion of the EC and foreign investment, talk of raising the limit to 7 per cent. Neither of these parties is known for its economic sophistication and it is questionable whether they or their supporters are aware of the consequences of such an apparently small deterioration in Poland's hard-won fiscal rectitude. No single party will emerge as the clear winner but as the political debate heats up, the Solidarity-based parties will strive to remind Poles of the miseries of their recent communist past.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- THE OUTGOING PARLIAMENT  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Main coalition partners  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Fatherland Coalition: Catholic church-backed bloc grouping right-wing parties, including the Christian Nationalist Union (ZChN), which formed a part of the outgoing cabinet. Loyal to the church; strong on issues such as banning abortion. Appears to have dropped hopes of getting growth through fuelling inflation. Seats: 71. Share of 1991 vote: 8.7%.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Democratic Union (UD): Sprang from the Solidarity movement's intellectual and white-collar supporters. Combines strong commitment to budget stringency and anti-inflationary policies with social democratic approach to issues such as division of church and state. Seats: 57. Share of 1991 vote: 12.3%.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Liberal Democratic Congress (KLD): Free-market party which has held many economic portfolios in previous governments and wants to continue with present economic policies. Seats: 52. Share of 1991 vote: 7.5%  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Main opposition parites  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Democratic Left Alliance (SLD): Successors of the old Communist party and trade union allies. Promises to repair welfare net and improve health and education standards while easing present stringent budget policies only 'slightly'. Seats: 58. Share of 1991 vote: 12%.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Polish Peasant party (PSL): Hundred-year-old farmers' organisation which survived post-war period by collaborating with Communists. Promises budget support for farming and more protectionist policies. Seats: 49. Share of 1991 vote: 8.7%  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

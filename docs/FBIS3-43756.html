			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Five different types of identity documents will be  acceptable for the 27 April election. The Home Affairs  Department says the green ID card issued in 1950, the blue ID  document issued since 1972, all green ID's issued since 1980,  reference books issued to blacks since 1950, and ID's issued by  the TBVC [Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda, Ciskei] states are  acceptable. The department has requested that those already in  possession of a valid ID not apply for a new document at this  stage because it might delay the provision of valid documents to  those who need it for the April poll.</p>

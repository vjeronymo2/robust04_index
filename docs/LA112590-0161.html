			<p><P> November 25, 1990, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> U.S. READY TO OFFER U.N. RESOLUTION ON FORCE THIS WEEK;  </P> <P> IRAQ: BAKER CONFERS WITH OFFICIALS OF COLOMBIA AND MALAYSIA IN QUEST FOR  SUPPORT IN SECURITY COUNCIL.  </P> <P> Strong signs emerged Saturday that Secretary of State James A. Baker III, after  a remarkable diplomatic odyssey that ended at Los Angeles International  Airport, will present a U.S. resolution authorizing use of force against Iraq  to the U.N. Security Council this week, probably Thursday.  </P> <P> Despite noncommittal stands by two nations he consulted Saturday -- Colombians  in Bogota and Malaysians at the airport -- the Bush Administration feels  confident that the measure will receive at least the necessary nine votes in  the 15-nation council, and no vetoes from any of the five permanent member  nations.  </P> <P> By unofficial tabulation, seven members of the council appear committed to vote  for the resolution and five nations, including the Soviet Union are likely to  support it as well. The remaining three -- Cuba, Yemen and Malaysia -- are  expected either to vote against it or abstain.  </P> <P> Baker has covered five continents in five grueling days in quest of support for  the resolution, which would authorize a 25-nation coalition with military  forces in the Persian Gulf region to use them to implement the 10 U.N.  resolutions that demand Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait.  </P> <P> From the sophisticated hotels of Paris last Tuesday to the parched lands of  Yemen on Thanksgiving to the verdant heights of Colombia on Saturday, Baker has  argued in person to all but one of the council members that Iraq's aggression  against Kuwait must be reversed with force if peaceful diplomatic means  continue to show no results. Only Cuba had not yet been consulted on the new  resolution.  </P> <P> Cuba has been the only council member to vote against any resolution so far. It  did so only once, although it abstained on four other measures. Yemen, the only  Arab nation on the council, has abstained five times. All other members have  voted for all of the resolutions.  </P> <P> Virtually all nations consulted by Baker have emphasized their preference for a  peaceful solution to the gulf crisis, as has Baker himself in presenting the  U.S. view. His remarks at a press conference in Bogota reflected the case he  has been making throughout.  </P> <P> "We strongly prefer a peaceful and political resolution of this crisis," he  declared. "But perhaps the best way to achieve it is for us not to rule out the  option of force. It may be the only thing (Iraqi President) Saddam Hussein  understands . . . and if it (force) is to be a credible option, we must lay the  appropriate military and political foundations for it," through a buildup of  forces and a U.N. resolution authorizing their use.  </P> <P> The response of Colombian Foreign Minister Luis Fernando Jaramillo was also  typical of the stand of the smaller non-permanent members of the council,  including Finland and Ivory Coast, which have not openly committed themselves  to the American case so far but who seem inclined to do so.  </P> <P> "Colombia really stands for peaceful solutions of conflicts," Jaramillo said.  "But Colombia cannot accept the fact that, through force, a party has violated  international order."  </P> <P> In Los Angeles, Baker met Malaysian Foreign Minister Abu Hassan Omar, who had  flown here from Kuala Lumpur. Both used identical language to describe "a very  good" meeting.  </P> <P> Abu said his country's Cabinet and other officials will meet at midweek to  decide on the U.S. proposal. He said that he and Baker "discussed it as  equals," and he said of Malaysia, "We are good friends of the Arab countries,  both sides -- Saudi and Iraq."  </P> <P> U.S. officials are confident of Soviet support, and probably that of China as  well, in the forthcoming council debate. But the wording and timing of the  resolution may be subject to bargaining among the five permanent members -- the  Soviet Union, China, Britain, France and the United States -- as well as other  members.  </P> <P> Current expectations are that the resolution will have two phases, the first  calling for a final peace overture to Iraq to which Hussein must respond  positively by a certain time. If the deadline passes without movement, the  use-of-force provision would take effect.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Patt Morrison contributed to this story.  </P></p>

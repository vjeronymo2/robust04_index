			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Survey of International Telecommunications (7): France looks far beyond home base - A new overseas offensive by France Telecom THANKS to the French telecommunications authority, telephone subscribers in and around the US city of Minnesota, last month plugged their personal computers into a new electronic directory. It is the first such service in the US which can be operated by so-called 'natural language,' whereby a user can just tap out a general question on the keyboard and the computer will produce a list of services able to help, from garages to dial-a-pizza. The directory, provided by US West, one of the seven regional Bell telephone companies, works by retrieving the answers to US subscribers' computer demands, in a fraction of a second, from France Tlecom's database in Paris. This is the latest example of how state-owned France Telecom, the world's fifth largest telecommunications operator, is trying to catch up in the trend for national telecommunications operators to compete outside their home bases, either in alliance with or competition against local operators. To make this possible, the French government has loosened the shackles that bound the telecom service to the state since its birth in the early 19th century, running a telegraph service for King Louis Philippe. France Telecom was a department of the telecom ministry, under close political control, until two years ago. Then it was transformed into a semi-autonomous state-owned company, to give it the management flexibility to compete in deregulated telecom markets in the European Community and around the world. Since then, France Telecom has for the first time in its history gone on the offensive in foreign markets. It struck a landmark accord in March with Deutsche Telekom, the German operator, to form a joint venture, Eunetcom, to provide worldwide telecommunications services for international companies; a serious competitor to Syncordia, a similar group being set up by British Telecom. Early last year, France Telecom even challenged British Telecom on its home turf, when it launched Transpac Network Services in the UK to operate private telecommunications networks - like Eunetcom - for large companies. It was the first time that a national telecommunications operator from one European country had tried to compete on the fixed networks of another. In a smaller UK deal, France Telecom has also teamed up with the Swedish national telecom operator to take a 25 per cent in Ram Mobile Data, a British company which offers data transmission by mobile telephone. Further afield, it has over the past year taken stakes in Telmex, the privatised Mexican telecom operator and participated in a takeover of Argentina's northern networks, to gain an entree into what will be fast developing markets, ripe for modernisation. A similar strategy was behind its two first deals in eastern Europe, to open a mobile phone network in Poland, with Ameritech, one the US regional operators and to help set up a pageing system in Czechoslovakia. If France Telecom has been busy abroad, it has also continued to be active at home, where it is continuing to enlarge its networks, develop areas where it lags international competition, like mobile phones. Turnover rose by 7 per cent to FFr115bn last year, on which France Telecom made a pre-tax profit of FFr16bn. However, that dropped to a mere FFr1.6bn net after the FFr14.5bn annual levy which the state charges France Telecom. The levy, the last remaining legacy of its history as a state agency, will disappear at the end of next year, when the group will start to pay normal corporate tax. This would have added around FFr6bn to net profits last year, estimates Mr Marcel Roulet, group chairman. As in previous years, last year's sales expansion was led by a strong growth in business traffic. Facsimile machine use rose by 50 per cent, while computer data transmission was up by 12 per cent. The number of lines rose last year from 28m to just over 29.1m, of which 80 per cent are now connected to digital exchanges, giving France one of the highest levels of digitalisation in the world. This modernisation of what was 20 years ago one of Europe's worst telecom services, has permitted a steady improvement in quality. Digitalisation has also permitted a fast expansion over the past year in the number of subscribers to Numeris, the integrated services digital network which allows voice, data and pictures to be piped down the same line. Numeris had 150,000 subscribers nationwide by the end of last year, six times more than in 1990. Minitel, meanwhile, has continued its relentless growth, with a 7 per cent rise in the number of terminals to 6m. French citizens spent a combined total of more than 105m hours last year tapping away at their Minitel keyboards, making use of more than 15,000 services. By far the most popular of these is the electronic telephone directory. The project, launched 11 years ago, in part owes its fast growth to France Telecom's controversial policy of giving away terminals, has been criticised by the Cour des Comptes, the government's financial watchdog, as a waste of money. A recent audit by Coopers and Lybrand for France Telecom disagrees, pointing out that Minitel will have made a FFr4.3bn profit in the 16 years to 2000, if the extra traffic it generates is taken into account. One of the operator's weak areas continues to be portable telephones, use of which is still one quarter of that in Britain. Here France Telecom is staking everything on the future generation of Group Special Mobile (GSM) digital mobile phones, launched in Paris and Lyon in July, and a complementary network of cheap mass-market pocket phones, nattily named Bi-Bop, for use in cities. France is one of the first European countries - along with Germany - to introduce GSM, the big advantage of which is that it offers a big increase in capacity over existing analogue mobile networks. France's current two analogue networks, run by France Telecom and its one private sector competitor, Societe Francaise du Radiotelephone, already have around 375,000 subscribers between them, near their 400,000 subscriber maximum capacity. With GSM in place, France Telecom believes that mobile phones will provide around a fifth of its income from telephone charges by the end of the decade. It will mark a radical change in French telephone users' habits.</p>

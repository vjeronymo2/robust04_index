			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / New Zealand heads for 5.5% growth rate New Zealand's economic growth has accelerated sharply and is likely to exceed 5.5 per cent in the 12 months to the end of this month, Mr Bill Birch, finance minister, said yesterday. Mr Birch, who is in London on an international tour to brief the financial markets, said in an interview that the country's 10 years of 'bruising' adjustment and reform, designed to restore international competitiveness, were paying off in export-led growth and a rapid rise in investment. The latest estimate compares with a forecast of 2.9 per cent for 1993-94 made only last October by Ms Ruth Richardson, Mr Birch's predecessor. The government believes annual growth rates of 3.5-5 per cent are sustainable. Manufacturing investment grew by 30 per cent last year, industrial capacity utilisation was approaching 90 per cent, and unemployment had dropped to 9.1 per cent from a peak of 11.5 per cent, Mr Birch said. Consumer price inflation, influenced by an appreciation of the New Zealand dollar, is expected to remain around 1 per cent, in the middle of the zero to 2 per cent range which the Reserve Bank is contracted to achieve under New Zealand's arrangements for the central bank's independence. Faster growth has reduced estimates for the budget deficit. Mr Birch said that in the fiscal year ending June 30, it would be less than 1 per cent of GDP or under NZDollars 800m (Pounds 310m), compared with a NZDollars 2.2bn deficit originally budgeted and NZDollars 1.4bn estimated in October. Mr Birch is expecting future budget surpluses but gave no specific forecast. He said New Zealand was benefiting from labour market reform - which he spearheaded as labour minister - deregulation, painful restructuring of industry and of government spending, and the opening of the economy. The National party government won re-election only by a narrow margin in November. Mr Birch said, however, that economic reform had been pursued by both leading parties during the 1980s and had wide support. 'Now we want to carry on and ensure that the benefits of those reforms are demonstrated and captured.'</p>

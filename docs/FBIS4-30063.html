			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 23 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  and the head of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [of Japan,  SDPJ], a former coalition member, failed Thursday to find common  ground to patch together the severed ties between the ruling  coalition and the SDP.    SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama told reporters that talks  with  Hata did not bear fruit because sessions between the two sides  over policy pacts are still continuing.    Coalition parties and the SDP, which are holding talks  toward  forming a policy agreement, could not find any middle ground in  their reconciliation talks that would pave the way for the SDP  to rejoin the alliance, official sources said.    Although Hata indicated Thursday that his minority cabinet  would resign en masse, a condition the SDP has demanded for  returning to the fold, off-and-on sessions between the two sides  aimed at achieving a policy accord before forming a new  coalition, hit an impasse over differences on tax reform, the  sources said.    SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo told reporters the party  cannot immediately agree on the tax reform issue, including a  hike in the current 3 percent consumption tax rate.    The coalition sought an SDP agreement to specify the size of  the hike, but the socialists, who objected to the introduction  of the tax, rejected the request.    The minority coalition and the SDP will continue to discuss  the matter Friday, the sources said.    On Hata's remarks that he is ready to step down with all his  cabinet ministers, Kubo said he takes the statement seriously  and urged Hata to resign voluntarily en masse.    At a press conference after the long-overdue fiscal 1994  budget cleared the Diet, Hata, 58, said he is ready to disband  his cabinet if it is necessary to bring the SDP, a primary force  in the previous coalition administration led by Morihiro  Hosokawa, back to the camp.    The House of Representatives Diet Steering Committee,  meanwhile, failed to set the timetable for the lower house to  hold a plenary session to vote on a no-confidence motion against  the Hata cabinet, which was submitted Thursday by the Liberal  Democratic Party (LDP). The LDP has said the minority  administration does not reflect people's views.    The LDP, which was ousted by the coalition last August after  dominating Japanese politics for 38 years, demanded that the  lower chamber take a floor vote on the no-confidence motion on  Friday but the coalition opposed it, saying talks with the SDP  are continuing, the sources said.    It depends on SDP members whether the no-confidence motion  passes the lower house, they said.</p>

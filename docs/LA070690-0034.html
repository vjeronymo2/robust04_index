			<p><P> July 6, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EXTRA HELP FOR ELEMENTARY PUPILS URGED;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: THE HEAD OF THE NEA CALLS FOR A $2.2-BILLION PROGRAM THAT WOULD  OFFER INTENSIVE TRAINING FOR STUDENTS IN NEED OF ADDED ATTENTION.  </P> <P> The head of the National Education Assn. on Thursday called for a $2.2-billion  program that would offer an intensive session to prepare elementary students in  need of extra attention.  </P> <P> Keith Geiger proposed Operation Jump Start during the opening session of the  NEA's annual meeting, explaining that the program would be an "all-out,  full-alert effort to give every elementary child who needs it an educational  booster shot."  </P> <P> About one-third of the nation's 26 million elementary students would be  involved, he said.  </P> <P> In his first address as president to the union's policy-making body of about  8,100 delegates, Geiger asked the federal government to provide half of the  estimated $2.2 billion needed for Operation Jump Start. States and local school  districts would pick up the rest.  </P> <P> At a news conference, Geiger said that those identified for Operation Jump  Start would be given a two-week head start on the school year, in classes  limited to 15 students. The teachers would be those the students will have  during the regular school year, Geiger said.  </P> <P> Also at the meeting, the nation's largest teachers union said that public  schools should offer day care, meals and health screening for preschool,  kindergarten and elementary pupils.  </P> <P> The NEA board of directors approved a committee report that said public schools  should be the primary provider of such early childhood services. It said that  they should be universal, with low or no cost to the child, and that all  children would have equal access.  </P> <P> With the exception of Head Start, most day care or preschool programs are  offered by private or nonprofit organizations. Head Start provides education,  meals and health screening for needy youngsters ages 3 to 5, but officials said  only a small percentage of eligible children are served by the program.  </P> <P> The report did not contain an estimate of the cost of implementing its  recommendations.  </P> <P> The committee said that its recommendations were prompted, in part, by changes  in American families and the labor force. It also cited changes in the  demographics of poverty, increases in the preschool population and its changing  ethnic composition.  </P> <P> NEA statistics showed that between 1960 and 1985, the percentage of traditional  households -- mother, father, two school-age children -- decreased from 60% to  7%.  </P> <P> It said also that more than 3.2 million mothers work outside the home, and  200,000 more mothers join the labor force yearly. By 1995, it is estimated that  80% of children under age 6 will have mothers working outside the home.  </P></p>

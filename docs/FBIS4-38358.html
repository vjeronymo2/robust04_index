			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "`Ostankino' Correspondents Have Been </F> Denied Accreditation"]    [Text] Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has adopted a  decision to deprive correspondents of the "Ostankino" television  company who work in Ukraine of their accreditation. This was  stated to UKRINFORM by Yuriy Serhyeyev, chief of the Information  Administration at Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He  pointed out that the decision had been adopted in view of the  actions, which are incompatible with international concepts of  information. The representative of the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs also stated that the decision had been adopted following  "the provocative coverage of events in Odessa, the Crimea, and  in Eastern Ukraine." All of this led us to adopt such a  decision, he said. We are not depriving these mass media of a  possibility to work, but we want information carried by them to  be objective.</p>

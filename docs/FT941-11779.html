			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / Canadians to launch big social security review Canada's new Liberal government has launched a review of the social security system with a view to trimming costs, targeting programmes more effectively to people in real need and bringing more people into the workforce. Mr Lloyd Axworthy, human resources minister, told parliament he expected to introduce legislation by next Christmas to reform programmes such as unemployment insurance, social welfare and government-funded training schemes. In addition, the government plans to follow the example of several European countries by examining innovative job-creation proposals such as work-sharing through a shortened work week. 'The objective is to find out what really works so people can work,' Mr Axworthy says. Canada has one of the world's most generous social-safety systems, ranging from unemployment insurance benefits of up to CDollars 445 (Pounds 227) a week, to taxpayer-funded, universal healthcare. But spiralling costs have intensified pressure for reforms. Social security, health care and education now make up about 60 per cent of federal and provincial spending. In particular, existing programmes are criticised for their bias towards 'hand-outs' rather than incentives to coax able-bodied welfare recipients back into the workforce. Mr Axworthy said the government would draw up its proposals after the widest possible consultations, including a series of public conferences, a parliamentary committee, and negotiations with the 10 provinces. Several of the programmes are administered by the provinces, with financial contributions from Ottawa. These transfer payments have become a growing point of friction, as the federal government has sought to lighten its burden while maintaining uniform standards across the country. Several provinces have already begun to overhaul their own social-assistance schemes. Alberta has taken the route of across-the-board spending cuts. Newfoundland, with a 20 per cent unemployment rate, plans to replace welfare payments with a guaranteed minimum income which can be supplemented with earnings from a job. New Brunswick has launched a 'workfare' project which makes welfare payments conditional on participation in intensive training courses.</p>

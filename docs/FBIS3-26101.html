Their statements, which differ  from normal ones, are worth pondering.    A Guangdong official disclosed that Yang Shangkun met with  provincial officials while in Guangdong. He listened to an  account given by these officials. Yang, who has kept a  relatively low profile since the 14th CPC Congress, talked  volubly. He expressed support for Guangdong's reform, saying  that the province had a correct guiding ideology, which was  worth recommending. He particularly asked the special economic  regions to consolidate their achievements.    It is said that Yang Shangkun spoke highly of Guangdong's  proposal in the new round of reform of reestablishing the  province's superiority, particularly the superiority of Shenzhen  and Zhuhai, which included the tentative ideas of establishing  the Nanhua financial center and setting up a free trade zone.  When the question of Shanghai's Pudong was mentioned, however,  Yang Shangkun remained silent.    During his visit to Shenzhen the other day, Tian Jiyun  stressed "reform, opening up, delegation of powers, and  flexibility," saying that herein lies the crux of mainland's  economic development.    Tian Jiyun spoke highly of the recent reforms. He said that  a market economic mechanism will be gradually introduced to  replace the forsaken planned economic model, which was  disadvantageous to development of productive forces.    Guangdong officials say that the remarks of Yang Shangkun  and  Tian Jiyun meant more than what they say and are worth  pondering. It shows that there are differences within the CPC on  a number of issues.    Reportedly, there are also serious differences within the  State Council. Besides external affairs and the Three Gorges  project, Premier Li Peng will not bother about other businesses.  Zhu Rongji and Zou Jiahua argued contentiously as they shared  different views on the capital for key construction projects.  Qian Qichen and Li Lanqing also attended to their own business.</p>

			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Saatchi warning The fragile status of US economic recovery and the even more fragile status of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, one-time world beating media group, received a jolt as Saatchi issued a gloomy trading statement which sent the stock plunging. Speaking at a media conference organised by US investment house PaineWebber, the group said it would have to carry out Pounds 10m of redundancies and make other cuts that would hit 1993 profits. The statement was a response to the loss of two big accounts and an anticipated drop in 1994 earnings. The shares, which fell 23 to 157p, have tumbled from a theoretical Pounds 50 a share since the October 1987 crash; last year there was a one-for-10 consolidation which revalued the stock. Neither that nor a Pounds 73m rights issue early this year have offset the steady decline. Broker SG Warburg was said to have been 'shocked' by the Saatchi statement and analysts moved quickly to lower earnings forecasts. Hoare Govett cut its 1993 estimate by Pounds 6m to Pounds 19m and next year's figure to Pounds 36.7m from Pounds 42m. Mr Guy Lamming of James Capel said worries over US recovery and the impact of 'brand de-emphasising' would continue to overhang the stock. Rival media group WPP, which owns J. Walter Thompson and Ogilvy and Mather, lost 4 to 88p. The second takeover bid in as many weeks kept the broadcasting sector buzzing as Granada launched a Pounds 600m hostile offer for LWT. The prospect of a prolonged assault prompted speculation in the market that LWT's manouevring could be a ploy to entice an overseas bidder, either as a white knight, or to draw a higher offer from Granada. Under the latest government proposals, overseas players will be allowed to bid for UK broadcasters after January 1, 1994. Leisure analysts pronounced the bid as a good strategic move for Granada, which came as the group announced full-year profits. These came in ahead of market forecasts, prompting a raft of upgrades to around the Pounds 210m level for 1994. However, some analysts are worried about the company's longer term income stream. Granada slipped 5 to 485p in turnover of 5.4m. LWT edged up a penny to 586p - 6p above the Granada all-share offer. Familiar bid talk stalked regional brewer Morland as speculators responded to a weekend press article which predicted the imminent return of Greene King to the fray. The latter failed to land Morland last year and still holds a 29.3 per cent stake. Speculation has been rife since October when Whitbread restructured its shareholdings, giving it an 11.9 per cent stake in Morland, with Greene King being tipped as the most likely buyer. Yesterday, Morland shares surged ahead 53 to 578p, although dealers said trading was thin. Greene King was steady at 570p, as was Whitbread 'A', at 561p. Half-time results from Scottish &amp; Newcastle came within market forecasts, although the dividend increase was considered disappointing. Profit-taking left the shares 14 cheaper at 524p. A bearish note on the oil sector issued by NatWest Securities, plus news that Moody's, the US credit rating agency, is considering a downgrading of debt ratings, with the emphasis on Enterprise Oil, saw the latter retreat 10 to 437p. Other oils suffered from another weary performance from crude oil prices, which settled well below the Dollars 14 a barrel mark. BP closed 4 1/2 lower at 327 1/2 p. Hints of exploration success in the Yemen helped Clyde edge up 2 to 45p. HSBC was hard on the heels of Standard Chartered as the bank sector's best performer, with the strong showing by the Hong Kong market helping HSBC move up 22 to 777p on good turnover of 3.9m. Lloyds rose 12 to 638p on 2.4m traded, with Lehman Bros said to have been an aggressive buyer of the shares, while TSB, a big mover recently, eased 3 1/2 to 234p on 6.5m traded. Royal Bank of Scotland, another of the sector's front runners, spurted 9 more to a record 439p. Abbey National, on the other hand, declined 7 to 445p, with the market fretting about a further cut in the bank's mortgage lending rates, a move which will impact on profit margins. King &amp; Shaxson, the money broker, retreated 6 to 135p after revealing a steep fall in interim profits and on news that it was considering the acquisition of Greig Middleton, the stockbroker, which will involve K&amp;S issuing up to 12m of its shares. Life assurance stocks continued to suffer from worries about the imminent report from the Securities and Investments Board. Dealers said, however, that falls in the life stocks owed more to deteriorating sentiment than any massive weight of selling. Legal &amp; General weakened 13 to 519p and Prudential 6 1/2 to 354p.

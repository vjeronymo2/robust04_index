			<p><P> June 3, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOS ANGELES TEACHERS' STRIKE SETTLEMENT  </P> <P> As a citizen I was appalled when I watched the LAUSD police manhandle teachers  who were demonstrating at the district offices on May 22. As a teacher I was  incensed when I saw men and women grabbed in headlocks, slammed onto the hood  of a car, arms wrenched behind their backs to be handcuffed and finally placed  in a patrol car.  </P> <P> As a citizen I was infuriated when it was stated that the reason for this  brutality was because the teachers were accused of trespassing.  </P> <P> As a teacher all LAUSD police officers I know have always performed their  duties in a professional manner, displaying restraint when required and showing  sensitivity when appropriate.  </P> <P> However, the badge-happy "rent-a-cop" mentality displayed by the LAUSD officers  at the district office on May 22 showed only contempt.  </P> <P> Perhaps their actions reflect the district's true feelings toward teachers.  </P> <P> JIM CROMWELL  </P> <P> Woodland Hills  </P></p>

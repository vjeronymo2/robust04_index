			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Cary Huang, China editor, in Beijing] </F>   [Text] China is resuming Stalinist planning economics by  stockpiling staple foods. The move is prompted by price rises  in major cities in December and panic buying in recent years  after sweeping market-driven reforms. It also underscores  serious concern by the leadership over increasing inflation and  other potential social instabilities, Beijing analysts and  diplomats say.    The decision, mapped out by Ministry of Internal Trade and  endorsed by the State Council China's cabinet, orders localities  to revive a Mao-era practice of storing basic goods and  necessities. "Storage of important commodities is the basis for  the government to guarantee supply to meet the needs of basic  life of the people, to combat inflation and deal with natural  disasters and other unexpected events," Chinese sources quote a  government circular as saying.    The central government is asking localities, especially  large  and medium-sized cities, to have a certain quantity of  commodities such as grain, pork, sugar and edible oil in  storage. Consumer products are also listed but the central  government notes that emphasis should be laid on necessities and  commodities sensitive to markets. Beijing also requires  localities to set up risk funds to enable the government to  maintain stockpiles.    The practice was popular under socialist planning economy  throughout Mao's period, by which the government controlled all  market supplies under a rationing system. However, the system  has abated since the late 1970s when paramount leader Deng  Xiaoping launched market oriented economic reforms and openness  policies.    Nevertheless, the government has kept grain stores-the  rationing system for this staple food was only recently  abolished. The circular says the storage system should only be  conducted by government departments through state-run commercial  enterprises. The cost should be met by the state and enterprises  will not be liable.</p>

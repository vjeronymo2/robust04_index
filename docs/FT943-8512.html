			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / New building orders rise 15% New construction orders for the second quarter of the year rose 15 per cent from the same period last year, government figures showed yesterday, Andrew Jack writes. Orders received by contractors for construction work were down 4 per cent from this year's first quarter. The figures, published by the Department of the Environment, are based on the value of orders at existing prices adjusted to exclude normal seasonal variations. New orders in the private housing sector were 3 per cent lower in the second quarter than in the first quarter and 21 per cent above the second quarter last year. The total value of new orders in June was Pounds 1.71m.</p>

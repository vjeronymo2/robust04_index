			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (3): Leaders far ahead of pack - Balanced Accounts MR IAIN Saunders, chief executive of Robert Fleming Investment Management, has a fight on his hands to get his company back among the top dogs of the balanced pension fund management business. Only four years ago Fleming was second in the annual FT league table of funds under management, but by the end of last year it had slipped to seventh place. Though even a short period of indifferent performance can spell big trouble in the context of the intense competition that now rules in the pension fund arena, Mr Saunders claims he is winning. In 1990 Fleming achieved a return some 1 per cent ahead of the median for pension funds. The fund management structure has been reorganised, with teams focused upon different types of funds. 'We feel we are very much back on track,' he says. A handful of successful managers is now winning almost all the new business in balanced accounts. Mercury Asset Management, Phillips &amp; Drew Fund Management, Schroders and Prudential Portfolio Managers are drawing away from the rest, along with a single rising star, Gartmore. Five years ago the then top three managers accounted for 31 per cent of the aggregate business of the Top 20. This year's top three hold 39 per cent of the total funds. 'I've never known the business to be so concentrated,' says Mr Paul Myners, chief executive of Gartmore. He concedes this is in some respects worrying, but of course it suits the likes of Gartmore, which is currently getting on most of the short lists. A typical case was that of the Merchant Navy pension funds, focus of the most spectacular bust-up in the industry in recent times, when they threw out their in-house manager Argosy Asset Management a few months ago. Gartmore and PDFM duly picked up most of the business when external management contracts were offered. Although dozens of managers are still in theory in the hunt for new balanced mandates, some are starting to lose heart. For instance Bankers Trust Investment Management, a long-standing operator in the British market, has decided to relinquish its remaining UK balanced accounts and to focus on specialised international briefs. Meanwhile the remarkable Mercury Asset Management continues to lead the pack by a long way. It is secretive about its investment performance, probably because with hundreds of clients there is significant divergence and any mention of a MAM average performance would provoke complaint from those who had done worse. However, it plainly succeeds in keeping most of its clients happy, although the highly publicised loss of a small specialised UK equity contract for the Marks &amp; Spencer unit trust last year illustrated the problems that big managers can have with small, fussy clients. MAM has retained its much bigger contract with the M &amp; S pension fund, however. In general, management contracts have not been changing especially fast in the pension fund sector recently. According to Mr Roger Hunt, marketing director of Prudential Corporate Pensions, 'pension fund trustees may be too absorbed with the consequences of the Barber judgment to consider manager changes this year.' The Pru is the sole insurance company to have broken through into the big time in the external pension fund management business. PDFM is the only ex-stockbroker to have done the same (although nowadays it is an independently constituted offshoot of Union Bank of Switzerland). MAM and Schroders Investment Management have come from the merchant banking sector. Gartmore, now owned by Indosuez, was originally an independent manager of investment trusts. Elsewhere Barclays de Zoete Wedd Investment Management is the market leader in index funds, and naturally manages the Pounds 5bn-plus Barclays Bank pension fund. But many famous names have fallen by the wayside over the past 10 years or so. According to Mr Paul Haines, investment director of consultants Noble Lowndes, the reason is the breakdown of the old City of London connections, and the rise of the consultants, who have developed a much more competitive selection process involving beauty contests. 'Fewer appointments are made because of banking or stockbroking connections, or because someone is owed a favour,' he says. 'The short lists will tend to be the same. Greater concentration is an inevitable consequence.' It is performance over several years that counts, but 1990 appears to have been a particularly good year for PDFM. According to information collected by the magazine Equity International, PDFM was the top performer last year, albeit in the sense that it lost less of its clients' money than any other major manager. Its return of -8.4 per cent (including property) was some 2 percentage points better than the industry median. Queen Anne's Gate Asset Management, which turned independent after the water industry privatisation, was close behind, and Rothschild and Gartmore also did well. Such figures can be selective and incomplete (the Pounds 4.7bn ICI pension funds, for instance, achieved a rate of return of -7.7 per cent in 1990), so it is the ability of managers to score well and consistently in the league table of funds under management that is the real indication of lasting quality.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In view of the statement by Ivo Sanader, head of  the Croatian delegation in the work of the transitional  committee in Vienna, given on 9 March to the Austrian paper DER  STANDARD, Kasim Trnka, head of the Bosnia-Herzegovina delegation  in the committee for the preparation of the constitution and  other documents for the federative republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, has issued the following statement for the  public:    In his statement Mr. Sanader voiced numerous imprecisions  and  inaccuracies about the work of the transitional committee. In  this way he, among other things, mentioned the existence of  Croatian and Bosniak cantons and said that Mostar would be the  capital of the community of the Croatian cantons.    The concept of the constitution of the proposed federation,  whose bases have been established by the Washington agreement,  does not envisage ethnic cantons. This constitution does not  envisage any other form of state organization beside a  federation, cantons, and communes. Therefore, Trnka emphasizes,  there was never any talk of any capitals of any community of  cantons. The arbitrary statement by Mr. Sanader that Mostar  will be the capital of such a community is completely inaccurate  and bears no relation whatsoever to the Vienna talks.    Such statements, as well as certain other steps, do not  contribute toward the strengthening of mutual trust or the peace  process as a whole.    The Croatian delegation and the U.S. mediators had all these  imprecisions and inaccuracies pointed out to them, after which  Mr. Sanader personally asked me to accept his apologies, reads  the statement for the public by Kasim Trnka, head of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina delegation in Vienna talks.</p>

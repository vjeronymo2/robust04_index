			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow volatile in wake of rate increase Wall Street US shares reacted wildly to the Federal Reserve's announcement yesterday afternoon that it would raise the Federal Funds target rate by 75 basis points to 5 1/2 per cent, writes Lisa Bransten in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 3.37 at 3,826.36. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 lost 1.01 at 465.03, while the American Stock Exchange composite was 0.11 easier at 448.61 and the Nasdaq composite 0.88 firmer at 769.02. Trading volume on the New York SE was 340m shares. Immediately after the Fed's announcement, the Dow shot up more than 23 points on the heels of a rallying bond market. But the index dropped substantially as the long bond returned to its pre-announcement level, the Dow falling 21 points before rebounding somewhat. A broad consensus of economists expected an increase of about 50 basis points, to 5 1/4 per cent, so the Fed's move caught some off guard. Interest rate increases are generally bad for the markets, because they deter corporate borrowing. Some economists attributed falling share prices to signals from the Fed that it might move to raise the interest rate target again in the near term. 'Today's tightening is hardly going to represent the definitive end,' said Mr John Lipsky, chief economist at Salomon Brothers. Share prices were mixed among the banks, which tend to be particularly sensitive to interest rate changes. Gainers included Chemical Banking, Dollars  1/8 up at Dollars 36 1/2 , and Chase Manhattan, Dollars  1/2 ahead at Dollars 36 3/4 . Declining were NationsBank, down Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 47 3/4 , and BankAmerica, Dollars  1/8 lower at Dollars 42 1/4 . Microsoft, the software maker, saw its shares increase Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 64 5/8 on news that it would launch a new, on-line service to be available in 35 countries. Digital Equipment was up Dollars 1 at Dollars 33 5/8 on news that it would manage the client/server network for Microsoft. ADRs of British Telecommunications, which will help carry the new service, closed unchanged at Dollars 61 3/8 . Whirlpool increased by Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 53 after announcing that it would streamline operations by cutting 3,200 jobs in its European and North American operations and closing two North American plants. Two retailers gained ground on reports of strong third-quarter earnings. Home Depot put on Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 47 3/4 and JC Penney Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 47 3/4 . Dayton Hudson dropped Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 80 5/8 in spite of a strong earnings report. Canada Toronto stocks finished softer after early strong gains were wiped out by the US interest rates rise, and traders said they expected choppy trade to continue. The TSE 300 index shed 8.29 points on the day at 4,168.90 after putting on more than 20 points initially. An analyst said investors either had to step outside the market (yesterday) or be strapped in and have a very strong stomach. Volume totalled a moderate 59m shares valued at CDollars 698.5m and declining stocks outscored rises by 471 to 266. Among interest rate-sensitive issues, the real estate sector was hardest hit, sinking 46.05 to 2,152.66. Another seven of the 14 sub-group indices fell, including transport, down 47.19 to 4,495.18. Golds lost 24.15 at 9,679.98 in spite of higher bullion prices. Newbridge Networks climbed CDollars 2 1/4 to CDollars 46 3/4 after Merrill Lynch upgraded its rating on the stock to near-term above average. Vitran jumped CDollars 1 1/8 to CDollars 9 on news that it has acquired a US freight carrier, the Overland Group of Companies, doubling the size of the company.</p>

			<p><P> August 10, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME TECH / WHAT'S NEW IN VIDEO: 'FOURTH OF JULY' ARRIVES IN STORES WITH A BANG  </P> <P> THIS WEEK'S MOVIES  </P> <P> One of the most praised, successful and controversial films of last year, "Born  on the Fourth of July" (MCA/Universal, priced for rental, R), leads off this  week's videocassettes with a bang.  </P> <P> Based on the real-life experiences of Ron Kovic (though with some stretching of  the facts), "Born on the Fourth of July" is the dramatic story of a soldier who  volunteered to fight in Vietnam but returned paralyzed below his chest.  Director Oliver Stone ("Platoon," "Wall Street") provides the lengthy but never  boring film -- winner of two Academy Awards -- with his usual gritty view, and  Tom Cruise surprised many detractors with his strong performance as Kovic.  </P> <P> Other recent pictures new to video this week:  </P> <P> "Revenge" (RCA/Columbia, $89.95, R) came out earlier this year with a big star  (Kevin Costner) and a hot director (Tony Scott of "Top Gun") but still only  managed to gross about $16 million. The passionate-triangle thriller also stars  Anthony Quinn, Madeleine Stowe and Sally Kirkland.  </P> <P> "Blue Steel" (MGM/UA, $89.98, R) stars Jamie Lee Curtis as a rookie cop who  gets involved with a crazy killer. The most publicized aspect of this 1990  release was that it was directed by a woman (Kathryn Bigelow).  </P> <P> "Coupe de Ville" (MCA/Universal, priced for rental, PG-13) -- not to be  confused with the Robin Williams movie "Cadillac Man" or the Clint Eastwood  vehicle "Pink Cadillac" -- stars Alan Arkin, Joseph Bologna and Patrick Dempsey  in a comedy about three brothers who try to deliver a classic car to their mom  for her birthday.  </P> <P> "Torrents of Spring" (HBO, $89.99, PG-13) is a period drama starring Timothy  Hutton and Nastassja Kinski, directed by Jerzy Skolimowski.  </P> <P> "Rockula" (Cannon, $89.95, PG-13) spoofs vampire films and rocks out with Bo  Diddley, Thomas Dolby and Toni Basil.  </P> <P> VINTAGE VIDEO: "Elvira's Midnight Madness" is the umbrella title given to  Rhino's latest batch of schlocky horror films from the late '50s:  "Frankenstein's Daughter," "She Demons" and (directed by bad-movie master  Edward Wood, Jr.) "Night of the Ghouls."

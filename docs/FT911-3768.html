			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Walesa looks to clear air in UK PRESIDENT Lech Walesa arrives in London today hoping for good weather and determined to convey some 'home truths' about the way western countries are dragging their feet over reuniting Europe in the twilight of the cold war. 'I perform badly when its rainy and misty' he said, adding: 'I've had the sun on my other trips,' referring to recent journeys to Washington, Paris and Brussels where he has urged western investors to come to Poland. These visits have revealed west European leaders unwilling to speed integration with post-Communist countries at the moment when, according to Mr Walesa, 'everything is possible'. In Britain he will be encouraging businessmen to put money into Poland, where the government is maintaining strict monetary controls in an attempt to lower inflation to a monthly 1 per cent by the end of the year. Mr Walesa will meet bankers at the Bank of England on Thursday and urge them to halve the Dollars 11bn his country owes them, as western governments have agreed to do. His visit comes in the wake of 40 hours of talks in Paris at the weekend between Polish negotiators and representatives of 17 western countries to whom Poland owes Dollars 33bn. The talks produced a framework for a 50 per cent debt reduction. This foresees Poland devoting Dollars 600m a year until 1994 to debt service payments, by which time the debt should have been reduced by half on condition that Poland maintains its anti-inflation programme agreed with the International Monetary Fund. Repayment of the entire debt, however, should be complete by the year 2014. President Walesa will be staying with the Queen at Windsor during his three-day visit. Meetings with Mr John Major and Mrs Margaret Thatcher, the present and former prime ministers, and Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour party leader, are also envisaged.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 13 May (TANJUG) -- The relevant  authorities shall warn conscripts who fail to respond to a  general mobilization call up about the possibility of the use of  force, although the period of time necessary for reporting  cannot be shorter than 12 hours. This is the essence of the new  Federal Government regulation on the mobilization of citizens,  whose Article 35, as announced by the Federal Defense Ministry's  information service, says:    "If citizens-conscripts do not respond to a general  mobilization call up in numbers prescribed by individual  mobilization plans, relevant district bodies, that is  military-territorial bodies, will order the mobilization service  to directly and personally inform the conscript who failed to  report and warn him about the possibility of the use of force if  he does not report in a period of time not shorter than 12  hours."    One of the innovations in this regulation is that the  mobilization of combat units and institutions will be carried  out in due time and gradually and that, unlike what was  prescribed by regulations until now, only certain institutions  or parts of institutions, as well as an optimal number of  conscripts needed for the consolidation of the country's defense  system, will be liable to mobilization.</p>

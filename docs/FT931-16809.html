			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / Seoul predicts more trade deficit cuts SOUTH KOREA cut its trade deficit almost in half to Dollars 4.92bn (Pounds 3.23bn) in 1992 and officials predict the deficit will shrink to Dollars 3.5bn this year. Exports last year rose by 6.8 per cent to Dollars 76.8bn on a customs clearance basis, while imports were almost unchanged at Dollars 81.7bn, according to preliminary statistics from the Ministry of Trade and Industry. The ministry estimates that exports will rise by 8 per cent to Dollars 83bn, while imports will grow by 6 per cent to Dollars 86.5bn. The expected growth in imports this year is because of increased purchase of foreign machinery for plant automation and building supplies for several big infrastructure projects. Export growth last year was led by petrochemicals, steel, vehicles, tyres and containers, while shipments of textiles, toys and footwear were sluggish as the country's light industry lost competitiveness through higher wage costs. The trade deficit in 1991 reached a record Dollars 9.7bn.</p>

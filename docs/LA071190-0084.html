			<p><P> July 11, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FRIENDS BID FAREWELL TO ACTIVIST SNYDER;  </P> <P> HOMELESS: THOUSANDS, CELEBRITIES AND UNKNOWN, PACK THE SERVICES. HE IS  EULOGIZED AS A 'GIANT . . . VOICE FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE.'  </P> <P> Cher stood on the flower-filled podium and lauded him for finding beauty in  people whom others had "written off." Martin Sheen called him a "giant,  uncompromising and compassionate voice for social justice."  </P> <P> But by and large, Tuesday's farewell to homeless-advocate Mitch Snyder was more  like a political rally than a solemn funeral service. The tone was appropriate,  said many of the rich and poor, famous and unknown, who gathered by the  thousands to remember Snyder, filling a park across from the Federal City  Shelter that Snyder helped create in downtown Washington.  </P> <P> "I don't think you can separate the politics from the man when it comes to  Mitch Snyder," said Hilda Nikkel, a Mennonite from Canada who took time off  from work to "pay tribute to a pretty great man."  </P> <P> The Rev. Jesse Jackson, who officiated, praised Snyder but insisted that the  best eulogy was to continue his work.  </P> <P> "As he ascends to glory," said Jackson, "he leaves us here to tell the story  that America's dream is incomplete, that the Liberty Bell has a crack in it  until the homeless are housed and the hungry are fed."  </P> <P> Snyder was found dead in his room at the shelter last Thursday in an apparent  suicide. A note found with the body indicated that Snyder was despondent over  problems in his personal life.  </P> <P> Carol Fennelly, his long-time companion and fiancee, said that during several  of Snyder's hunger strikes he told her what he wanted his funeral to be like.  "There were specific people that he requested speak at his funeral," she said.  </P> <P> So as mourners wiped eyes damp with sorrow and brows damp with sweat on a hot  day, a string of the celebrities and supporters he had mentioned stepped up to  a clutch of microphones arrayed above Snyder's plain pine coffin.  </P> <P> Sheen, who portrayed Snyder in a television movie, said that "it is not  possible to comprehend Mitch's passing any more than it is possible to  comprehend the very great and wondrous mystery of his life."  </P> <P> In fulfilling his call to "feed the hungry, clothe the naked, house the  homeless," Sheen continued, Snyder "confronted the wrath of both church and  state as well as a troubled nation's conscience."  </P> <P> "Mitch ministered to the unacceptable, and so he himself was sometimes  considered unacceptable," said Karen Saunders, an official at the women's  shelter Snyder helped run.  </P> <P> Dick Gregory, the comedian, was one of the few who alluded to Snyder's cause of  death. "Mitch was a soldier," he said, "and soldiers wear down when they are on  the front lines.  </P> <P> "I don't know what was in that darn (suicide) note," he said, turning to  Fennelly, "but don't let him blame it on you."  </P> <P> Washington Mayor Marion Barry, taking a break from his trial on drug and  perjury charges, also spoke. Snyder believed, Barry said, that "whether you are  addicted or not addicted, you are still a human being in God's eyesight."  </P> <P> As the ceremony continued, a sticky drizzle turned into heavy sunshine, forcing  mourners to use their umbrellas first for shelter, then for shade.  </P> <P> Phillip Berrigan, the radical priest who met Snyder while both were serving  time in prison, called Snyder a "true shepherd" who fought against "the false  shepherds of church and state."  </P> <P> One of Snyder's sons, Dean, sat on the podium with others who participated in  the ceremony. Snyder had separated from his wife and two sons in 1969.  </P> <P> After the service at the shelter, speakers and mourners marched down  Pennsylvania Avenue behind Snyder's coffin, encased in an elegant horse-drawn  hearse.  </P> <P> They stopped at the city's main administration building where they demonstrated  for greater support for the homeless.  </P> <P> One of the marchers, Iva Joyce Spencer Vaughn, said that she first met Snyder  in the 1960s anti-war movement and remembered him having said that "if no one  followed his casket at the end of his life then he would have failed." '  </P> <P> 'Well," she said, making a broad sweep at the procession with her arm, "you can  see for yourself."  </P></p>

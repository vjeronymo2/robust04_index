			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Technology: Herbal sales set to grow Pharmaceuticals giants and consumer products groups are quickly moving into the herbal remedy market, according to a report* by consultants McAlpine, Thorpe &amp; Warrier. The report shows that companies such as Rhone-Poulenc Rorer and Sanofi of France, Johnson &amp; Johnson and Merck of the US, and Ciba-Geigy and Sandoz of Switzerland have made acquisitions of herbal medical companies in the last three years. The report estimates there are more than 2,000 herbal medical companies in Europe and more than 220 in the US. Most companies in this highly fragmented sector do not have sales beyond their national bases. More than 90 per cent of these companies have a turnover of less than Pounds 5m and the same percentage is privately owned. The largest company is Proctor &amp; Gamble; its herbal laxative Metamucil has sales of Pounds 80m a year. The pharmaceutical groups are attracted by the fast growth of the herbal medicine market which is expanding more rapidly than the traditional over-the-counter sector. In the US, UK and Italy it is growing at between 12 per cent and 15 per cent a year by value. The report argues that greater knowledge of the side-effects and dangers of modern medicine will drive demand for herbal medical drugs. The increasing size of the geriatric market in western countries will also be a factor. The report warns that there is a danger of new regulatory requirements for herbal products equivalent to those existing for pharmaceuticals. This would stifle the introduction of new products and diminish the effectiveness of existing products through the reduction in the number of ingredients they are allowed to contain. Germany is the largest market in the world for herbal medicines, with annual sales of Pounds 1.2bn representing nearly 25 per cent of the national pharmaceuticals market. About 40 per cent of these sales are sold on prescription. The US is the next largest with sales of Pounds 480m. *Competitive positioning: Who's doing what in the herbal medical industry.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Regarding Comment 3d., many of the suggested activities may be authorized, funded or conducted by Federal agencies. The responsible Federal agency active within the range of the northern right whales is required to consult with NMFS regarding its projects and activities under section 7 of the ESA. If the activity is found likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the species, directly or through habitat degradation, reasonable and prudent alternatives would be offered that could include restrictions. Even if the activity is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the species, NMFS is required to provide an incidental take statement that identifies the impact of any incidental taking of northern right whales by the action agency, and specifies reasonable and prudent measures, and terms and conditions that must be complied with, to minimize such takings. These measures may include restrictions upon the activity. In addition, private entities are prohibited from taking an endangered species pursuant to section 9 of the ESA, which may include harm to the species caused by habitat degradation. In this regard, such activities are already prohibited as a result of listing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regarding Comment 3e., NMFS agrees that discharge of pollutants at the mouths of rivers that empty into the calving grounds should be monitored for possible effects on the habitat. A designation of critical habitat may assist Federal agencies in evaluating the potential environmental impacts of their activities on northern right whales and their critical habitat. The designation may also help focus state and private conservation and management efforts in those areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 4: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Two commenters recommended that a ``distance buffer'' be established around northern right whales. One recommended that a minimum approach distance of 100m to 300m should be established for all vessels around right whales.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second commenter recommended that NMFS establish around every northern right whale, in any area designated as critical habitat, a 500m radius ``protection zone,'' and prohibit any vessel or person from entering or knowingly remaining within this zone. The commenter further suggested that such a buffer zone is consistent with similar rules already adopted by NMFS and cited as examples the minimum distance rule for humpback whales ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Megaptera novaeangliae <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) in Hawaii (50 CFR 222.31) and the 5.5 k buffer zone established around Steller sea lion ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Eumetopias jubatus <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) rookeries and major haulouts in Alaska (50 CFR 226.12). The commenter continued that such protection zones for the area designated in Cape Cod Bay and Stellwagen Bank would be consistent with existing Massachusetts regulations (322 CMR 12.00  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), which require that no one approach or remain within 500m of a right whale in state waters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In both cases, the purpose of the suggested buffer zones would be to ensure that northern right whales are undisturbed as much as possible throughout their range, and to keep vessels far enough away so that there is no danger of a collision between whales and vessels. Critical habitat designations reflect specific determinate geographical areas containing physical or biological features essential to the conservation of the species. While NMFS recognizes that the area around each whale is important, it is not appropriately the subject of a critical habitat designation. Rather, such buffer zones should be established through separate rulemaking, similar to the special prohibitions for humpback whales in Hawaii.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 5: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter suggested that NMFS implement research and monitoring programs focused on: (1) Behavioral changes (of northern right whales) associated with the possible impacts of vessel traffic, noise and whalewatching; or (2) the effects of dredging activities and their associated vessel traffic, siltation and noise in the southeastern United States through continued observation of dredge activity and aerial surveys of right whales in and adjacent to buffer zones around dredging operations; (3) the impact of pollution on phytoplankton and zooplankton abundance_specifically the impact of the Boston Harbor effluent outfall; and (4) the effects of whalewatching activities on the northern right whale. The commenter recommended that, if necessary, NMFS promulgate regulations to mitigate the effects of these activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In addition to the monitoring program implemented by the Southeast Implementation Team, NMFS is developing a 3&hyph;5 year research plan that will focus on research needs identified as priorities in the Northern Right Whale Recovery Plan. The current research program is the result of several meetings that occurred on April 14&hyph;15, 1992, in Silver Spring, MD; June 18, 1993, in Brunswick, GA; and July 16, 1993, in Silver Spring. These meetings established the following research priorities:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. To determine the wintering location(s) of most northern right whales in the northwest Atlantic through the deployment of satellite tags on selected female right whale;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. to determine daily movements within the wintering/calving area. Tagging with VHF tags in the SEUS could determine the daily movements of these animals. This information could be useful to develop a long-term monitoring program to reduce ship strikes in the SEUS;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. to determine the unknown location of a third summering area. There are three matrilineal stocks of northern right whales recognized. One of the stocks does not visit the Bay of Fundy, but is seen in the GSC and CCB during spring, and in the SEUS in winter. Satellite tracking a tagged female from the third matriline (these have already been determined from mtDNA analyses and photoidentification) in the GSC or CCB in the spring might lead to the location of the other summer location of northern right whales in the North Atlantic.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d. to identify ``bottlenecks'' in the rate of recovery. The reasons for the northern right whale's low reproductive rate relative to southern hemisphere right whales are unknown. One theory is that there is too much inbreeding as a result of the extremely depleted population. The extent of inbreeding can be determined from genetic/molecular identification through mtDNA biopsy sampling and sexing using molecular techniques; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> e. to determine the best location and methods to monitor recovery of this population.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

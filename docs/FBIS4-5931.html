			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 14 (KCNA) -- The Pyongyang-visiting  group of former heads of state and government and politicians  from different countries led by ex-President of Costa Rica  Rodrigo Carazo Odio visited Mangyongdae Wednesday.    At the old home in Mangyongdae where the great leader  President Kim Il-song was born and spent his childhood, the  guests saw the relics with keen interest, hearing the immortal  story about this historical home.    After going round the revolutionary sites on the Mangyong  hill, former member of the parliament of France and member of  the European Parliament Pierro Ceyrac said Mangyongdae is a very  beautiful place. "The Korean people look up to, revere and  follow President Kim Il- song because he has performed great  feats for them, always finding himself among them," he noted.    At the construction site of the Nungna suspension bridge  which is being built by Korean People's Army soldiers, former  President of Costa Rica Rodrigo Carazo Odio congratulated the  soldiers participating in construction for the welfare of the  people. He expressed the belief that the Korean people would  certainly achieve progress.    After inspecting the three-revolution exhibition, former  Prime Minister of Egypt Aziz Sedky said Korea has built a  wonderful independent national economy. He noted that Korea has  attained self-sufficiency in nearly all things because its  policy is correct.    "Agriculture has developed and the people are well off as  good policies for the people are pursued in your country," he  said, adding: "All the people are evenly off. This is  important."    After making a round of the Mangyongade School Children's  Palace, General of the Army Jeannou Lacaze, former chief of  staff of the Armed Forces of France, member of the European  Parliament and chairman of the union of independentists, said he  had never seen such talented children. "I will remember till the  end of my life everything I saw at the palace," he added.    President of the Summit Council for World Strategy of Japan  Hirogatsu Ota said it is wonderful to bring up the children,  regarding them as "kings" of the country.    The guests went round the May Day Stadium and Chongchun  Street of the capital on the same day.</p>

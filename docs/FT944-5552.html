			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / Russia in new plea for peace as it masses troops on Chechen border President Boris Yeltsin of Russia last night reissued an ultimatum to the warring factions in Chechnya to stop fighting as Russian troops massed on the borders of the breakaway Caucasian republic. But he withdrew an earlier threat to impose a state of emergency in Chechnya, leading to hopes that a peaceful solution could still be found to the crisis. A Russian parliamentary delegation, led by Mr Sergei Yushenkov, head of the defence committee, yesterday held talks with senior Chechen government officials in the capital, Grozny. Before leaving Moscow, Mr Yushenkov said his aim was to prove that 'by peaceful means it is possible to attain greater results than by using force' and to help release up to 70 Russian fighters who were captured in recent fighting in Chechnya and threatened with execution. It is believed that Mr Yushenkov met Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, on Wednesday and received the government's blessing for his peace mission. Chechnya, an oil-rich region of 1m on the edge of the Caucasus mountains, has defied Moscow's will for two centuries, boasting a tradition of fierce independence. Despite Mr Yeltsin's ultimatum, fighting continued in Chechnya yesterday with unidentified aircraft opening fire on a disused airstrip in Grozny killing at least one person and badly injuring two children. Other aircraft swooped over the city dropping leaflets urging the Chechen government forces to lay down their arms. But President Dzhokhar Dudayev, the Chechen leader, who declared independence from Moscow three years ago, continued to express defiance yesterday. Speaking at a press conference in the basement of the presidential palace, Mr Dudayev read out a letter from demonstrators demanding that one Russian soldier be killed every time a warplane flew over Grozny. According to news agency reports, Mr Shamsedin Yusef, the Chechen foreign minister, said: 'We will fight until we die. We will go to the grave here.' Russia has long supported Chechen opposition forces seeking to overthrow Mr Dudayev but has refrained from direct intervention for fear of becoming embroiled in a protracted conflict. Chechnya's leaders have promised the region would become a 'second Afghanistan' if Moscow sent in troops, and threatened to unleash a terrorist campaign throughout Russia. Mr Yeltsin has promised decisive measures to resolve the unrest in Chechnya and ensure the release of the Russian captives, whose plight has touched a raw public nerve. 'The president shares with all his heart the worries of the relatives ...of Russian servicemen held in Chechnya,' his press spokesman said. Western diplomats in Moscow thought it significant that Mr Yeltsin's ultimatum omitted the previous threat to declare a state of emergency and suggested it either signified a toning down of the rhetoric, military disinformation, or confusion in the president's press department.</p>

			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Government Bonds: Approval of budget cuts lifts Italian issues EUROPE'S high-yielding government bond markets enjoyed the biggest gains on a day when some European markets and the US were closed for public holidays. Italian government bonds gained about half a point, benefiting from the news that the Senate had finally approved cuts for the 1994 budget which will cut L31,000bn from the deficit. The budget legislation will now pass to the lower chamber. Spanish government bonds ended firmer following the release of poor unemployment figures which showed the Spanish jobless rate rising to 17.2 per cent in October. Dealers said the jobless news had raised some hopes that the Bank of Spain would lower interest rates at today's repo. The Spanish bond futures contract rose 0.06 on the day to end at 101.97, having touched a high of 102.23. GERMAN government bonds ended lower in thin trading and the bund futures contract saw selling pressure at the 99.62 level, falling back to close at 99.46. Mr Otmar Issing, Bundesbank board member, was reported saying that the central bank would cautiously test the scope for further interest rate cuts as price and money supply growth pressures eased, but dealers said the news did not have much impact on the market. INDEX-LINKED gilts were the main movers in the UK government bond market yesterday, with dealers suggesting that the fall of over half a point for the second consecutive day was probably due to a couple of big US investors taking profits. Conventional stocks saw little activity, with longer-dated gilts slipping about  1/32 . The December long gilt future closed  1/16 lower at 113 7/8 while the December short sterling contract settled five basis points lower at 94.40 as dealers said hopes of a near-term cut in the base rate appeared to be evaporating. JAPANESE government bonds ended weaker on profit-taking, in the wake of the recent rally which saw the futures contract reach a six-year high earlier in the week. The rate on three-month certificates of deposit fell to an all-time low of 2.32 per cent yesterday. Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International, said he expected money market rates to continue to decline. 'The bond market has discounted a lot of the recent bond-positive news, but given the way the economy has performed recently there's still further room for the market to rally,' he said. The March futures contract, which took over yesterday as the most heavily traded contract from the December one, opened at 114.45 and ended at 114.30. The December contract fell to 115.10 from 115.17.</p>

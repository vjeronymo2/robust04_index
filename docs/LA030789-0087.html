			<p><P> March 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Venezuela lifted a nationwide curfew but kept martial law in effect in the wake  of several days of price riots that claimed 247 lives by official count and  injured nearly 2,000. The curfew had been imposed Feb. 28, a day after riots  and looting erupted when authorities announced steep price boosts for transport  fares, gasoline and some basic food items. Primary schools and kindergartens  resumed classes, and secondary schools are expected to reopen this week. It was  unclear when universities -- traditionally a center of protest in Venezuela --  will resume classes. Under martial law, soldiers can search houses without  warrants and detain suspects without charge.  </P></p>

			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / International Company News: HK businessman seeks O&amp;Y assets MR LI KA-SHING, Hong Kong's richest man, yesterday confirmed he was interested in acquiring some of Olympia &amp; York's assets. O&amp;Y, the world's largest private landlord, is negotiating with its bankers to reschedule Dollars 20bn of debts. A spokesman for Mr Li would give no details of his plans except that he was interested in some of O&amp;Y's assets. Mr Li stood down from the board of the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank last week so he could devote himself fully to his business interests. Mr Li, dubbed 'superman' by the local Hong Kong media, is one of the few big players in international property with the resources to acquire O&amp;Y's assets. Cheung Kong, his flagship, is estimated to generate cash flows of over Dollars 1bn a year. Mr Li, who is one of the biggest landowners in Vancouver, is also a 9 per cent shareholder in Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce - the Canadian bank which is estimated to have lent O&amp;Y CDollars 1bn (USDollars 840m). Last October, in his first venture into the US property market, he bought for his own account a 49 per cent interest in a New York office building, formerly Drexel Burnham Lambert's head office, from O&amp;Y for an estimated Dollars 47.5m. The New York office block is held through a joint venture partnership, guaranteed by O&amp;Y's US subsidiary. Mr Li took pains yesterday to state, through a spokesman, that his investment in that building was unaffected by the difficulties facing O&amp;Y. In a joint statement at the time the two parties said the transaction signalled 'an important strategic alliance' between Mr Li and O&amp;Y. This announcement followed persistent reports he was considering an investment in Canary Wharf, Europe's biggest single property development situated in the east end of London. Since then the two have not announced plans to co-operate on any more business ventures. Mr Li may, however, be interested in more than just O&amp;Y property assets. O&amp;Y owns 75 per cent of Gulf Canada Resources, one of Canada's largest refiners of oil and distributors of petrol. Mr Li controls Husky Oil, Canada's biggest producer of natural gas and oil, through two listed Hong Kong companies. Gulf Canada Resources would give him a fully integrated energy business in Canada. Against this, analysts said, Husky has been a poor investment, at least in the short term, and he could face competition problems if he were to buy Gulf Resources, not to mention a backlash from Canada's vocal economic nationalists.</p>

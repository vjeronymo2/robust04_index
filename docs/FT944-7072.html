			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Lloyd's makes regulatory services appointment Lloyd's of London has appointed Mrs Rosalind Gilmore, chief executive of the Building Societies Commission, as director of its regulatory services department, Ralph Atkins writes. Mrs Gilmore, who has previously worked at the Treasury and the World Bank in Washington, will be responsible for overseeing Lloyd's system of self-regulation. The 200-strong department also oversees litigation - a sensitive issue given that Lloyd's is embroiled in several legal disputes with lossmaking Names. Lloyd's would not comment on Mrs Gilmore's salary but according to the insurance market's latest annual report her predecessor earned between Pounds 130,000 and Pounds 140,000 last year, including performance related bonuses and other benefits. A spokesman at the Building Societies Commission, the statutory regulator and supervisor of UK building societies, said Mrs Gilmore's current salary was a little over Pounds 60,000. At the Treasury Mrs Gilmore ran the financial institutions division that was responsible for legislation including the 1979 Banking Act. She was appointed a non-executive member of the Securities and Investments Board last year. Mrs Gilmore succeeds Mr Bob Hewes who was appointed Lloyd's finance director earlier this year.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] "We have obtained this result because the Italians  want change and we can provide it," Berlusconi said in a  telephone interview from his house in Arcore. He was not  surprised by Forza Italia's result ("our polls had forecast  it"), but he thought "the Center would lose more."    "In any case, the results show that there is a gap between  the voters of the Center and its leaders, who are too close to  the Left," he added.    On the League's losses, Berlusconi was very severe: "They  should examine their conscience. People like those who respect  pacts."</p>

			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Australia and NZ face up to closer links - Differences are emerging in the approach taken by each country AFTER nearly a decade of economic convergence, Australia and New Zealand are starting to face a series of uncomfortable questions about the goals of their 1983 agreement on Closer Economic Relations (CER). Both sides are playing down the significance of talks due to begin next month between Mr Philip Burdon, New Zealand's trade minister, and Mr John Kerin, his counterpart in Canberra. But the success of CER has stimulated a debate on whether the convergence process should eventually lead to a single market, a common currency, and even political union. The immediate aim of CER was to remove artificial barriers to trade between the two countries, which have developed separately for most of this century in spite of their shared language and culture. Progress was slow at first, but by mid-1990 all bilateral tariffs and import and export curbs had been removed, together with export incentives, production subsidies and anti-dumping legislation. Also, free trade has been set up for a wide range of services, and public sector contracts in both countries are open to tenders from companies in either. The changes stimulated average growth in merchandise trade of 14 per cent a year between 1983 and 1990/91, from ADollars 1.3bn (Pounds 550m) in 1983 to ADollars 4.7bn. Trade in services, still subject to some curbs, was worth a further ADollars 2.3bn in 1989/90. The Australian Bureau of Industry Economics estimates New Zealand has done eight times better out of CER than Australia, mostly because of its increased access to the Australian market. New Zealand's merchandise trade with Australia is now in balance, against a 3:1 imbalance before 1983, and Australia is its largest trading partner and source of foreign investment. Australia has gained less obvious benefits from access to the New Zealand market, but New Zealand is its fourth largest trading partner and source of foreign investment. Both countries say the forthcoming review of the accord will be restricted to detailed discussion of specific problems, notably trade in services. New Zealand will urge abolition of trade union restrictions which limit competition on the Tasman Sea shipping routes, and for a joint aviation market, benefiting Air New Zealand. Wellington is keen to iron out discrepancies between the two countries' customs and quarantine services, and recognition of professional standards. Australia's priority is removal of impediments to trans-Tasman investment caused by differences between the two countries' taxation and corporate law regimes. Canberra officials say businesses in both countries are seeking changes allowing creation of more trans-Tasman companies such as Goodman Fielder Wattie, the foods group, and Fletcher Challenge, the resources and construction group. But differences are emerging in the approach taken by the two countries, mainly over the Australian pursuit of harmonisation, which New Zealanders tend to see as a threat to sovereignty. 'Harmonisation is not the word to use in this relationship,' says Mr Burdon, who prefers to see the process as a search for 'complementarity' between two systems with a common British root. Mr Burdon says the CER process has been of 'enormous importance' to New Zealand, mainly in the light of the long period of slow growth caused by extensive structural economic change since 1983. But the government is anxious not to raise expectations about the current round of talks, which it says do not involve discussions on the kind of 'grand vision' which started the process eight years ago. 'We intend to go a lot further, but this particular review is strictly nuts and bolts. In some respects, CER had got ahead of itself, and we need to sort that out,' Mr Burdon says. This relaxed approach is echoed in Canberra, where Mr David Richie, director of the foreign affairs department's New Zealand section, recently pointed out that 95 per cent of Australian trade is with countries other than New Zealand. 'In other words, it would be silly for both governments to approach CER with the overriding objective of creating a single market of 20m people in Australasia,' he said. Nevertheless, Australian officials expect pressure for closer links to continue to mount, particularly from the business sector, which increasingly regards the two countries as a single market. Mr Len Bayliss, a former New Zealand Treasury economist who now runs a Wellington consultancy, says New Zealand has already progressed well down the path to economic union, which he claims has 'huge silent support' from business. As evidence, Mr Bayliss points to the listing of most of New Zealand's larger companies on the Australian Stock Exchange, and the participation of New Zealand ministers in most of Australia's federal/state ministerial conferences. 'New Zealand is becoming a de facto, if not a de jure, state of Australia,' he says. 'Sydney has become the financial and economic centre of the region, and the reduction of tariffs and import controls is going to continue making that more noticeable.' So far, there has been little detailed consideration of how further economic integration could be carried out, although the Reserve Bank of New Zealand has pointed out that difficulties could arise in linking the NZ dollar to Australia's commodity-driven currency. Mr Burdon says the government is not ideologically opposed to a common customs area and a common currency, if clear benefits could be demonstrated, but sees no advantages in political union. 'There has been no demand for it in the last 91 years. Why would we want to change now?' he says.</p>

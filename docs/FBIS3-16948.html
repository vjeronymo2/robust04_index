He said that a national installation would  require 1Bn 270 Mn rubles, while Japan is prepared to grant  know-how free.    Nazdratenko said that the Maritime Territory would be forced  to agree to continue purchasing grain abroad. He explained the  decision by the fact that now one ton of the national grain  costs 270,000 rubles, but with the addition of transport costs,  it will cost 400,000 rubles. One ton of grain imported from  Canada costs 100,000 rubles.(end)</p>

			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Company News (This Week): Renault plan moves closer to the altar - Volvo Volvo's controversial plan to marry its car and truck operations to Renault, the state-owned French giant, should finally be decided this week by a handful of Swedish pension funds and insurance companies. Although the special shareholders' meeting is not until December 7, the outcome should be clear by the end of the week as key institutions make up their minds which way to vote. With 30 per cent of the voting capital already in the bag for Volvo, the odds are now in favour of the merger winning approval. But a further twist lies in the intention of Aktiespararna, the small shareholders' association, to make a legal challenge. Decisions to watch for are from three insurance companies that earlier expressed opposition because of their scepticism over French promises. Trygg-Hansa and SPP, sister insurance companies that hold respectively 1.4 per cent and 4.5 per cent of Volvo's voting capital, are set to announce their verdicts on Thursday and Friday. Skandia, with 3.7 per cent, is also likely to decide this week. Other key players are the pension and investment funds of Sweden's two leading banks, Scandinaviska Enskilda Banken and Svenska Handelsbanken, which control 13 per cent of the votes.

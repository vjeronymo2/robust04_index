			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Sizewell reactor 'will enhance coastal views' Controversial plans for a Pounds 3.5bn twin-reactor Sizewell C nuclear power station in Suffolk have been backed by the Royal Fine Art Commission on aesthetic grounds. Three nuclear reactor domes on the nationally important Suffolk heritage coast landscape would look better than one, the government-funded commission has said in a letter to Nuclear Electric, the state-owned generator, and local authorities. The dome of the single-reactor Sizewell B plant, nearing completion, and the rectangular block of Sizewell A, an ageing Magnox plant, stand side-by-side on the coast, designated by the government as an area of outstanding natural beauty. The Countryside Commission and the National Trust - which has a property at Dunwich near Sizewell, from which the nuclear station can be seen - have argued that Sizewell C would be an intrusion in the landscape. But the Royal Fine Art Commission, which advises on architectural matters affecting the visual environment, says that, in the flat landscape of marshland and sand dunes, coastal views of the station would be enhanced by the addition of two domes. 'One dome just looks like a sort of bump,' Lord St John of Fawsley, chairman of the Royal Fine Art Commission, said yesterday. 'Because the area is very flat with long coastal views, it needs something longer to go with it. We came to the conclusion that with three domes it looked much better.' Lord St John, a former Conservative cabinet minister, said the commission was not in a position to comment on whether the plant was needed, or whether it should be built. It was passing a judgment purely on the architectural design. The commission had also been greatly impressed by the proposed landscaping programme, he said. However, the commission had expressed reservations about the plant's planned security fencing, again on aesthetic grounds. It had also emphasised the need to remove any temporary sheds. The commission, which is funded by the Department of National Heritage, employs nine salaried staff and has 17 commissioners - many of them architects. It has rejected an invitation from Suffolk County Council to qualify its view. Ms Julie Craven, who chairs the council's environment committee, said yesterday she believed that the commission was looking at the buildings in isolation, rather than considering their position in the surrounding landscape. The Department of Trade and Industry is considering Nuclear Electric's planning application for the Sizewell C plant. Approval of the plan will also depend on the outcome of a public inquiry and of the government's review of the nuclear industry, the timetables for which have yet to be announced. Suffolk County Council this week voted to object to the plans for the Sizewell C plant, making a public inquiry inevitable.</p>

			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Olympia &amp; York Files for Protection: Insolvency maze with three corners THE FILING by Olympia &amp; York under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement in Canada may trigger a highly complex relationship with insolvency procedures in both the US and the UK. Under Canadian law, a CCAA allows the management of the company to remain in charge with protection from creditors. It could decide to allow O&amp;Y subsidiaries in the US and the UK to continue to trade if they were solvent. But if management decides to file for Chapter 11 protection in the US, and administration in the UK - the most likely insolvency options in either case  -there are few precedents to guide co-ordination between the different national courts. There are no international treaties to foster or require co-operation between the different national jurisdictions under which the O&amp;Y empire could fall, according to Mr Bill Drake, second vice-president of the Canadian Insolvency Practitioners Association and a partner with Ernst &amp; Young, the accounting firm. He said there had been at least one recent case of a US parent company in Chapter 11, with a Canadian subsidiary under CCAA and one of its divisions under administration in the UK. 'A lot is being done by innovative, bright practitioners working with sympathetic courts prepared to take a pragmatic approach.' CCAA - which has its origins in a short piece of legislation called the 1933 Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act - has a number of similarities with Chapter 11 in the US. The management of the company - as debtors - initiates proceedings by filing a petition with the senior court of the province under which jurisdiction it comes. The petition is almost automatically granted, protecting the company from any existing or future proceedings by creditors to recover their loans. The management then has a period of at least six months in which to file a 'plan of arrangement' with the court. In practice, this deadline is often extended with a new court order. In the meantime, the management can continue to trade and operate its business. A series of committees will be formed for secured and unsecured creditors, which must approve the plan of arrangement before it is brought to the court. Teams of insolvency practitioners - generally led by lawyers but also including accountants and merchant bankers and other professional advisers - will be brought in to help develop the plan. The court may also appoint an individual as a 'monitor' during the CCAA process, who is responsible for reviewing the work of the management, gathering the financial information during the process for the court, and reporting on the fairness of the procedures if disputes arise. If the creditors endorse the plan of arrangement when it is finally presented, the court is likely to endorse it. However, it may need to make a ruling if disagreements arise. It is rare for the disagreements to go this far, however, because if the court has to make a ruling when the plan is not endorsed, the result is almost inevitably bankruptcy. 'It's a fairly onerous end of the road when the creditors realise that if they don't agree then the company is gone,' said Mr Drake. 'By the time the plan gets to the courts, there have been extensive and at times exhaustive negotiations. It is very much a reiterative process to develop a plan acceptable to all stakeholders.' Meanwhile, it is possible that O&amp;Y subsidiaries in the US and the UK could also be subject to equivalent insolvency proceedings. In the US, Chapter 11 would allow the management to remain in charge of the company as 'debtor in possession'. They are granted a stay from their creditors, and given 120 days - which is extendable - to file a 'plan of reorganisation'. This must be ratified by creditors' committees and the courts. But Mr Sam Gerdano, executive director of the American Bankruptcy Institute in Washington, DC, notes that a recent estimate showed only 17 per cent of Chapter 11 reorganisation plans were accepted and implemented. The vast majority of companies ended up passing into Chapter 7 - bankruptcy. If O&amp;Y's UK subsidiaries pass into UK administration, the procedures are somewhat different. If a company's directors petition for insolvency, then a judge must decide whether to grant their request. If so, the judge appoints insolvency practitioners as 'administrators'. The administrators run the company in place of the directors, and have three months - which can be extended - to draft a 'scheme of arrangement'. This must be approved by creditors and the court.</p>

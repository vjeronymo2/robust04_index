			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Teacher vacancies reach record low VACANCIES for teachers at schools in England reached an all-time low in January, Mr John Patten, the education secretary, announced yesterday. Full-time vacancies fell by 30 per cent overall compared with 1992, with 785 openings at 19,500 nursery and primary schools, and 558 in 3,850 secondary schools. Vacancies for teachers of modern languages and mathematics fell by 40 per cent. Mr Patten, who released the information in a parliamentary answer, described the figures as 'good news for schools'. He said they meant there was little more than one vacancy for every 20 schools. Mr Patten also pointed out that teacher numbers in grant-maintained (opt-out) and council-controlled schools had risen from 394,900 in January 1992 to 395,600 in January 1993. However, provisional figures suggested that pupil-teacher ratios had risen slightly, from 17.44 pupils per teacher to 17.66. The comparable figure for 1979 was 18.94. This leaves the state sector with fewer resources than independent schools, which reported last month that their pupil-teacher ratio had dropped from 10.9 pupils per teacher to 10.7. If the effect of small A-level classes is accounted for by doubling the number of sixth-formers the figure for independent schools still improved from 12.6 to 12.4. In state schools, the vacancy rate is highest in inner London, at 1.5 per cent of teachers in post, while in outer London it is 0.5 per cent. For England excluding greater London, the vacancy rate is 0.3 per cent.</p>

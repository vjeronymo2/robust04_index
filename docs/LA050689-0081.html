			<p><P> May 6, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REMEMBERING LUCILLE BALL  </P> <P> In reflecting on the life and death of Lucille Ball, I realized I had always  thought of her not as an inaccessible icon of stardom so much as a lifelong  friend. Whenever I needed to get away from my own troubles, whenever I needed  to look at the lighter side of things, whenever I needed a good laugh, Lucy was  there.  </P> <P> Perhaps even more important than that millions of us loved her was the fact  that we genuinely liked Lucy. And our children and grandchildren are sure to  like this great comic talent every bit as much as we do.  </P> <P> May she now find the eternal happiness that her genius gave us all for all  time.  </P> <P> JOHN JB WILSON  </P> <P> North Hollywood  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Dora Elena Cortes and Manuel Cordero: "Colosio, </F> Victim of a Plot; Accomplice Arrested"]    [Text] Tijuana, B.C. [Baja California], 27 Mar -- Before  dawn on 27 March, the Attorney General's Office [PGR] arrested  Tranquilino Sanchez Vega, an aide to General Domiro Garcia  Reyes, whom the Presidential Staff put in charge of the security  around Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta. Sanchez has been  interrogated since early morning on his presumed complicity in  the attack that left the Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI]  presidential candidate dead.    The revealing pictures of Robert Gauthier, a news  photographer for THE SAN DIEGO UNION, changed the course of the  investigations, after the PGR reported through its chief, Diego  Valades, that only one person had fired at the PRI presidential  candidate. In one of the pictures taken minutes before the  attack in Lomas Taurinas and published by Associated Press (AP),  we can see when Sanchez, wearing a dark leather jacket and cap  with a badge in front, extends his right arm toward the  candidate and reaches over the shoulder of Colosio, who has his  back to Sanchez.    The release of these pictures and statements by doctors,  specialists, policemen, and authorities who are close to the  case, as well as statements residents gave to EL UNIVERSAL,  support the possibility that Luis Colosio may have been murdered  as a victim of a plot possibly involving members of his security  staff. Sources who were questioned said that "at least three  persons shot at Luis Colosio." The first shot came from  Colosio's left side; the second one, which hit Colosio in the  abdomen, from his right side; and the third one --apparently  shot by Mario Aburto Martinez -- was fired at the candidate's  head as he was falling to the ground. Everything seems to  indicate that the three shots were fired simultaneously and that  the assassins were within the security ring around the  candidate, which is a usual practice in every presidential tour.  It was said that there were snipers around.    The report on the plot to assassinate the candidate was  corroborated by the alleged involvement of individuals  responsible for Colosio's security, as well as by big logistical  mistakes made during his tour to Tijuana. Last-minute changes in  the schedule and adjustments to the podium from which Colosio  would speak in Lomas Taurinas attributed to the General Staff  make us think that the PRI candidate was not murdered by one  person alone, as the PGR stated.    Sources close to the PGR spoke about the commotion caused by  the pictures taken by the San Diego reporter. Said pictures were  immediately taken to PGR authorities in this city. One of these  pictures, published in the 25 March issue of THE SAN DIEGO  UNION, shows the PRI presidential candidate, and to his right is  Vicente Mayoral Valenzuela, former judicial agent, whom the PGR  arrested immediately after the assassination. The PGR later  announced that it would set him free "as the law stipulates."  One of his two children, who were part of Colosio's security  team, is next to Mayoral.    A few steps behind Colosio (in the same picture), we can see  assassin Mario Aburto Martinez, and right next to him we can see  a tall and muscular individual who is wearing a dark leather  jacket and a cap with a badge on the front. He was later  identified as Tranquilino Sanchez Vega. On his left arm, he is  wearing an band with Colosio's name on it. Staff Gen. Garcia  Reyes is right next to him.    The second picture clearly shows how both individuals  (Aburto Martinez and Sanchez Vega) advance until Aburto  positions himself on the right-hand side of the candidate and  Sanchez Vega is behind the alleged killer, with the right hand  (of Sanchez Vega) pointing towards the abdomen of the candidate.  He remains standing next to a stocky individual, the staff  general, who, according to eyewitnesses, was always accompanied  by Tranquilino Sanchez.    Members of the security corps who were hired by the PRI  Municipal Direction Committee in Tijuana to guard the candidate  said Gen. Domiro Garcia Reyes, together with Tranquilino Sanchez  Vega, ordered them to remove the white band bearing Colosio's  name from their arms, which they had decided to wear to identify  themselves.    In THE SAN DIEGO UNION photograph, it can be seen that  Tranquilino Sanchez, who was captured early this morning, wore  the aforementioned band, without Domiro Garcia Reyes asking him  to remove it, as he had done with the rest of the security  agents.    Without going into great detail, Humberto Sanoja Morrell,  one  of those in charge of the security group under the municipal  PRI, confirmed to EL UNIVERSAL that they had been ordered to  remove the band and leave the area "because the candidate did  not like security." Sanoja Morrell affirmed that both he and  Rodolfo Rivapalacio, who coordinated the group of security  agents, had gathered some 125 agents to form a barrier guarding  the candidate's path, but insisted they were ordered to leave  the area. Sanoja Morrell denied the PRI hired these security  people (including former State Judicial Police agents) because  most of them volunteered to participate in the campaign, as is  customary during electoral campaigns. He denied knowing  Tranquilino Sanchez Vega and said he was not a member of the  security staff (local security).    Meanwhile, sources we talked with told us that Colosio was  taken to Lomas Taurinas without heeding the warning that it was  one of the most dangerous parts of town, not only because of the  high crime rate but because security conditions could not be  guaranteed there. They revealed the PRI decided to set up the  speaker's stand in front of an enormous wall painted with the  word Colosio "that would serve as protection for the PRI  candidate, but because of an order by the Presidential staff  that accompanied him, the stand was set up above the wall, on  the hill, leaving Colosio absolutely unprotected. [no closing  quotation marks as published]    Eglantina Esquivel de Abad, a PRI member who publishes a  bulletin in Tijuana, said in an interview with this newspaper  that they apparently tried to assassinate the candidate when he  addressed the crowd, but the presence of children next to  Colosio prevented this from happening. Eglantina said she saw  when Aburto Martinez arrived at the crime scene, accompanied by  Vicente Mayoral Valenzuela, former head of homicide of Judicial  Police in Tijuana. She explained that both Mayoral and a tall  and robust man (seemingly Sanchez Vega) always accompanied  Aburto Martinez.    "When Colosio spoke they appeared nervous, as if they were  preparing themselves to do something bad, but since they were  unable to attack him at that moment, they began to follow him  and always had direct access to the candidate," Eglantina noted.  After the attack took place, she burst into tears hysterically  accusing Mayoral of being one of the assassins.    The interviewee asserted that a PGR official sought her  afterward to notify her she would have to appear before the PGR  "because my testimony would be very valuable. I refused,  however, because I did not know if he was really an official or  they were trying to shut me up because I was a witness."    Eglantina affirmed that she later went to the PGR office  accompanied by her two sons and a state police agent she had  known for a long time, "but once I arrived there, they just kept  me isolated in an office until 0200 on Thursday, because no one  ever interrogated me." Apparently, Eglantina Esquivel conceded,  "what they were trying to do was to keep my mouth shut because I  had seen who attacked the candidate." She insisted she was never  questioned in connection with the assassination. Eglantina  referred to the way in which the candidate was evacuated from  the area, as well as the cragginess of the terrain, which made  it impossible to think of a quick exit in case of an emergency.    Sources we consulted, who have participated in logistical  tasks in previous presidential campaigns, said "no person  responsible for the security of a candidate should have ever  allowed a rally to be held in such place as Lomas Taurinas."  Local PRI figured emphasized that "in this case, apparently  there was strong interest by the organizers of Colosio's  campaign that he appear there." They explained that Jaime  Martinez Veloz, Solidarity deputy delegate, was tasked with  organizing the event at the request of Mario Luis Fuentes,  former general director of Solidarity and current social  participation coordinator of the Colosio campaign. Both  officials have worked closely with former Public Education  Secretary Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon.    PRI members themselves have revealed that fellow members  from Baja California are outraged by the fact that Zedillo Ponce  de Leon, despite being originally from that area and PRI  campaign manager, was not in Baja California, arguing that he  wanted to avoid any speculation regarding his possible candidacy  to the Baja California Government.    PRI militants who were interviewed and who insisted on  pointing out other reasons justifing that Zedillo did not  accompany Colosio in his native state, added: "For heaven's  sake, no one is more qualified to represent the PRI in our state  than Zedillo."    Logistics experts have also pointed out the lack of a  mechanism of immediate attention to the candidate: "In the  middle of a campaign, those in charge of logistics are the first  to visit the states the candidate is scheduled to visit, and  makes arrangements with a hospital so that it will be prepared  to offer its services in case of an emergency. In addition to  this, blood for the candidate (particularly, in Colosio's case  because his blood type was considered uncommon) and a Mexican  Social Security Institute [IMSS] ambulance are taken along  during the entire political tour.    On this occasion, both of these aspects were ignored. The  candidate was taken to the General Hospital, a Health  Secretariat institution that lacked medical equipment and  instruments, and donors were solicited because blood was not  available. They note that no IMSS ambulance or any other  hospital was available at the incident's site so at first, he  had to be put in a suburban van to be moved later to a Delta-7  rescue unit, which lacked the equipment needed to attend to the  emergency. Policemen questioned confirm that Colosio was taken  to the General Hospital the long way -- it took 20 minutes --  when he could have been taken to IMSS Clinic 20, which would  have been taken at most five minutes.    An expert in providing security services to prominent  persons  from California State was questioned about all of this, and when  he took a look at the second photo taken by the reporter from  San Diego, he categorically said that: "I hope this man (Sanchez  Vega) forgives me, but he is getting ready to shoot in this  phote. I believe he was one of the men who shot Colosio in the  abdomen." He emphasized the way in which Sanchez Vega keeps his  arm above Colosio's shoulder, and stated that "that is a  shooting position, and therefore, this situation must be  clarified by Mexican federal authorities."    Another one of Gauthier's photographs, which shows Colosio  lying on his stomach, destroys the PGR argument claiming that  Colosio Murrieta was shot by one person, with an initial shot to  the head as stated by Attorney General Diego Valadez. Valadez  said that when Colosio had walked a distance of approximately 10  meters in the crowd, Mario Aburto Martinez, the presumed  perpetrator, who was on Colosio's right, drew a revolver, placed  it to Colosio's right temple and pulled the trigger, mortally  wounding Colosio.    "When he was shot in his right temple, with an exit hole in  the corresponding left temple, the victim turned around  counterclockwise, and while he was falling down, the attacker  pulled the trigger again to produce a second wound in the  abdominal area, where the bullet entered through the  hypogastrium and exited in the region of the right  hypochondrium."    Guillermo Castorena and Alvaro Garcia Taxilaga, Colosio's  doctors, signed an initial report establishing that Colosio  received two bullet wounds: one in the region of the skull  entering through the right temporal bone and exiting through the  left parietal bone. Other doctors who were consulted said the  said report indicates that Colosio was shot in the skull; the  bullet entered the right temple and exited "through the small  bone located above the left temple." Meanwhile, the second shot  was in the abdomen, entering below his left rib and exiting in  the region of the right rib.    Doctors who performed surgery on the PRI presidential  candidate gave EL UNIVERSAL assurances that the body of the  unfortunate man apparently received three shots from three  different weapons: two apparently .38-caliber specials and one  of apparently smaller caliber, perhaps .22 or .25-caliber.    This coincides with the innocent remarks made on a radio  station by renown Tijuana cardiologist Patricia Aubanel Riedel,  whose past successes include "open heart" surgery on Nobel peace  prize winner Mother Theresa of Calcutta. During an interview on  XEC Radio the day after Colosio's death, the cardiologist told  commentator Jesus Arnoldo Lopez Salcido: "He received two  different shots; one of them, which entered on the right side of  the brain in the area of the temple, came from a .38-caliber  revolver; the other, from a .22-caliber revolver, apparently  entered the left side of his abdomen in the sub-thoraxic area,  which led the team of doctors to believe that there had been two  shots."    The commentator asked the doctor if she meant that two  different weapons had been used, to which she answered: "This is  what we thought (the doctors who saw Colosio's body) and those  are our observations (while we were treating the candidate),  although we have not yet read the legal expert's report. It is  our assumption." Later, in response to the commentator's  insistence on finding out if two persons fired at the candidate,  Aubanel Riedel answered: "Yes, I believe so. The reports will  establish that." The reports did not mention it, however.  Instead, they presented a totally different picture: one weapon,  a Brazilian-made "Taurus" .38 special fired by one man, Mario  Aburto Martinez, 23.    Confidential reports provided to EL UNIVERSAL reveal that  Dr.  Aubanel Riedel's statements greatly upset Attorney General Diego  Valadez, who issued instructions to "fix that." During  subsequent interviews Dr. Aubanel attempted to recant what she  had said but there is a recording of the interview.  Coincidentally, Doctor Rosalina Guerra, director of the General  Hospital (where the late PRI candidate was treated), on the same  evening (of Dr. Aubanel's interview) also made statements on a  local television newscast. Dr. Guerra answered, among others, a  very specific question: Could the doctors establish whether the  wounds were caused by a certain weapon. Guerra categorically  denied this possibility, adding: "Doctors can only determine the  caliber of the weapon." We asked doctors on both sides of the  border (Tijuana and San Diego) about this and they said,  virtually without even thinking: "Of course; we can determine  perfectly well if the wounds were caused by guns of different  caliber, but we always prefer to wait for confirmation by  experts."    Another of the doctors who treated Luis Donaldo Colosio in  the operating room, shocked by his death, complained of "how  filthy all of this was" and asserted that the candidate had not  been shot twice but three times. Hospital personnel who by  reason of their profession were able to get close to the  operating room, confirmed this and even gave assurances that  "very strange things happened; for example, members of the  Presidential General Staff did not allow doctors from Mexico  City to treat the patient or to enter the operating room while  he was still alive." The personnel in question said an  altercation took place between Presidential General Staff  members and representatives from the PGR over this situation,  but the latter prevailed because they said they were in charge  of the situation. As a result, only local specialists and  doctors treated the candidate.    Eleven doctors treated Colosio and "none of them were from  Mexico City; all of them were local doctors," insisted a source  who added that two autopsies were conducted on the candidate's  body: one by the Tijuana Forensic Medicine Service (Semefo) by  Doctors Gustavo Salazar and Esteban Chapital, and another by  Federal District doctors accompanied by members of the Federal  Judicial Police.    Criminologists, who were asked about how Colosio was  wounded, said it is improbable his body would have acted the way  the attorney general said had the first shot been to the head.  They said that definitely, the shots to the lower part of his  body must have been fired first because there are reports that  Colosio put his hands on his abdomen and he would not have been  able to do that had the first shot been to his brain.    Some policemen have explained: "If you want to kill someone  you bring him down first and then you finish him off with a shot  to the head." The policemen noted that considering the height of  the victim and that of the killer, it appears impossible Colosio  could have received the wounds officially reported. The  policemen noted: "Have you seen how bulls tumble when they are  dealt the coup de grace with a dagger? This is how Colosio would  have dropped had the first shot been to the head." They went on:  "The body goes limp and flabby and the arms fall to the side of  the body."    Anibal Colosio, a cousin of the late candidate who was at  the  site, said that immediately after the attack, he saw Colosio  fall "to his knees." According to some people, Colosio placed  his hands on his abdomen. Others claim they heard at least three  shots. This apparently is confirmed by a picture taken by  Gauthier. The picture shows Colosio's position when he fell. It  shows his back and his hands as if trying to grab his stomach at  the time some people try to put him on his back. The people  interviewed explained that this shows that Colosio was finished  off with a shot to the head and this has moved the PGR to  redouble its efforts. It became known this morning that Attorney  General Diego Valadez and his closest aides have traveled to  Tijuana again.    Finally, with regard to the discovery of a video showing the  moment Aburto places the gun near the candidate's head,  consulted experts have mentioned the possibility of a  photographic gimmick. These experts pointed to the darkness of  the video and recalled that the attack took place shortly after  1700, when it was still daylight. They affirmed that the picture  is so nebulous that a photomontage gimmick is conceivable.    The same experts also pointed out the position of the  killer's hand noting that "considering the way the revolver was  raised and its height, it had to be noticed by security people,  who in the face of such a situation would have killed the  aggressor before he could have taken aim." As policemen, the  experts said, we think this film could have been "fixed" in the  evening. This fits reports received by EL UNIVERSAL the night of  the attack. Those reports speak of members of the military  staff reconstructing the events. The people of Lomas Taurinas  asked reporters: "What is the use of doing that now?"    This newspaper has been informed of another noteworthy  thing:  Alleged federal agents reportedly from Sonora State, videotaped  absolutely everything having to do with the PRI candidate.  Sources close to the PGR have also reported that "on the night  of the crime," Attorney General Diego Valadez "saw the video  over and over."    Regarding what happened to the arrested man the day of the  crime, EL UNIVERSAL has been informed that (after the people  tried to lynch him) he was placed in a suburban van occupied by  at least 10 other persons. The commander of Tijuana's Municipal  Tactical Group tried to prevent them from taking Aburto away  because the people were afraid Aburto would be killed. One of  the people in the van, however, identified himself as member of  the military staff and the van was allowed to drive away. People  who were close to the van when the rifle-wielding commander of  the tactical group stopped it, have reported that this police  chief told the people in the van: "I will let you keep going,  but I want this man alive when he gets to the Attorney General's  Office."</p>

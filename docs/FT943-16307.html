			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / UK Company News: National Parking bid faces referral The proposed bid for National Parking Corporation by a consortium of venture capital investors led by Prudential, the UK insurance group, could trigger a reference to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. National Parking, which owns National Car Parks and the fast-growing National Breakdown Recovery service, disclosed last week that it was involved in negotiations which might lead to a bid. The talks concern the possible acquisition of the 64 per cent stake owned by Sir Donald Gosling and Mr Ronald Hobson, the company's founders. Last week National Parking's shares rose from 450p to 575p in over-the-counter trading, valuing the private company at Pounds 675m. The group made pre-tax profits of Pounds 53.3m on turnover of Pounds 234m in the year to March 26 1993, including profits of Pounds 31.1m on its parking operations. Despite the concern of the Consumers Association and motoring groups about NCP's domination of private sector parking in the UK, the group has until now remained outside the interests of the Office of Fair Trading, the government's competition watchdog, because of a quirk in the law. Under the terms of a 1937 court ruling, car park operators are not considered to be providing either goods or services - instead they were deemed to be issuing licences to park - and are, therefore, not subject to competition legislation. However, in the case of a bid different rules apply. The OFT confirmed that it was examining the position to see if it had any 'interest or jurisdiction' should a bid materialise for National Parking. Under current legislation the OFT can recommend a reference to the MMC if a merger means either that the resulting group controls more than a 25 per cent market share, or because more than Pounds 70m of assets are involved. In either case the OFT can decide to recommend a reference, although this does not automatically trigger one. Market structure, the degree of competition between the two companies before the merger, and competition from other companies would also be considered.</p>

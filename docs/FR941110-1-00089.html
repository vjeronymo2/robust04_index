			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The current regulation requires all companies that destroy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or transform controlled substances, regardless of whether or not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they were produced or imported explicitly for transformation or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> destruction, to maintain records and to report to EPA the amounts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of substances destroyed or transformed within 45-days of the end  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the control period (annually). Facilities that transform or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> destroy controlled substances that were explicitly produced or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imported for transformation or destruction must submit an IRS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certificate of intent to transform or a destruction verification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the producer when the substance is sold or transferred. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> producer reports to EPA quarterly the quantities sold or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transferred for transformation or destruction with a copy of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> IRS transformation certification or the destruction verification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA requires the information from both the producer/importer and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the transformer/destroyer to crosscheck and verify the quantity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of controlled substances claimed to be produced or imported  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> without expended allowances explicitly because it was for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transformation or destruction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Reporting and recordkeeping requirements for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transformers of controlled substances produced or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imported for intended emissive uses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the current regulation, a person who transforms a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlled substance that was produced for intended emissive uses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may request additional production allowances or consumption  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowances from the Agency. The current regulation lists the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information the Agency must receive to consider a request for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional production allowances in &sect;82.9(c) and for additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumption allowances in &sect;82.10(b). A person may only request  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional production allowances and consumption allowances for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the transformation of class I controlled substances (except  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methyl bromide) that were produced for intended emissive uses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during the remaining control period from January 1, 1995, to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> January 1, 1996. A person transforming methyl bromide that was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> produced for intended emissive uses may request additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> production and/or consumption allowances until January 1, 2001.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA proposes waiving the annual reporting requirement for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transformation facilities that receive controlled substances that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were produced or imported for intended emissive uses, as long as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the facility does not request from EPA additional production or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumption allowances before January 1, 1996, and does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> request transformation credits after January 1, 1996. If a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> person transforms a controlled substance produced or imported for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intended emissive use for which additional production or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumption allowances are requested from EPA during the control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period from January 1, 1995, until January 1, 1996, or for which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transformation credits are requested from the Agency after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> January 1, 1996, the transformer must report to the Agency the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> name and quantity of substance transformed at the end of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed recordkeeping and reporting requirements for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transformer who requests transformation credits (beginning after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> January 1, 1996) are similar to the current requirements for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obtaining additional production allowances as listed under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;82.9(c). Effective January 1, 1996, a person who transforms a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> class I controlled substance (except methyl bromide) that was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> produced or imported for intended emissive use may submit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific information to EPA requesting transformation credits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (see Section A.1.c., ``The Post-Phaseout Procedures for Granting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Destruction or Transformation Credits). The following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information must be submitted to request transformation credits: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _The identity and address of the person requesting the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> credits;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _The name, quantity, and volume of controlled substance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transformed;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _A copy of the invoice or receipt documenting the sale of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the controlled substance to the person;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _The name of the use system from which the controlled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substance was recovered; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (v) Reporting and recordkeeping requirements for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> destroyers of controlled substances produced or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imported for intended emissive uses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the current regulation, all facilities that destroy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlled substances that were produced or imported for intended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissive uses are required to report the names and quantities of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> class I substances destroyed within 45-days of the end of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control period. In addition, these destroyers may request  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional production allowances and/or consumption allowances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from EPA under the current regulation in &sect;82.9(c) and &sect;82.10(b).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA proposes waiving the annual reporting requirement for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> destruction facilities that receive controlled substances that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were produced or imported for intended emissive uses, as long as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the facility does not request from EPA additional production or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumption allowances before January 1, 1996, and does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> request destruction credits after January 1, 1996. However, if a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> person destroys a controlled substance produced or imported for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intended emissive use for which additional production or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumption allowances are requested from EPA during the control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period from January 1, 1995, until January 1, 1996, or for which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> destruction credits are requested from the Agency after January  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1, 1996, the destroyer must report to the Agency the name and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quantity of substances destroyed at the end of the control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The recordkeeping and reporting requirements for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> destroyer who requests destruction credits (beginning after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> January 1, 1996) are similar to the information now required for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional production allowances as listed under &sect;82.9(c).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Effective January 1, 1996, a person who destroys a class I  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlled substance (except methyl bromide) that was produced or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imported for intended emissive use may submit specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information to EPA requesting destruction credits (see Section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A.1.c. for a description of the ``The Post-Phaseout Procedures for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Granting Destruction and Transformation Credits''). The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information someone must submit to request destruction credits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _The identity and address of the person requesting the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> credits;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _The name, quantity, and volume of controlled substance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> destroyed;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _A copy of the invoice or receipt documenting the sale of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the controlled substance to the person;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _The name of the use system from which the controlled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substance was recovered;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _The efficiency of the destruction process. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (vi) Recordkeeping and reporting for exporters of controlled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substances that are transformed or destroyed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The current regulation has no specific recordkeeping or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reporting requirements for exporters of controlled substances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that are transformed or destroyed. All exporters of controlled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substances, regardless of whether the substance is exported for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an intended emissive use, for transformation or for destruction,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must submit the information listed under &sect;82.13(h) to the Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> annually.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "No to the Attempt To Exclude Jerusalem"] </F>   [Text] Developments in the last hours of the UN Security  Council's deliberations on the hideous bloody massacre committed  by Zionist settlers in the holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque reflected  serious attitudes. These attitudes have deviated from the  principles governing the peace process. It is clear that such  attitudes seek to circumvent these principles instead of being a  motive to rectify the course of these principles, which has been  marred and obstructed by Israeli policies and practices.    The reservations--which were expressed only by the United  States over the term "occupied" in reference to the  Israeli-occupied territories, including Jerusalem, in return for  a mere oral condemnation of the terrible massacre--amount to  blackmail which would grant Israel a false legitimacy regarding  the status of Jerusalem. These reservations also violate the  international resolutions which consider this holy city as an  occupied territory and regard Israel's annexation of Jerusalem  as null and void and an illegal measure.    Stemming from Jordan's realization of both this serious  situation and the political facts which could result from it  under the aegis of the UN Security Council, the Jordanian  leadership and Government have embarked on a high-level  political move to circumvent the ongoing attempts regarding  Jerusalem's legal status and cautioning against the dangers  posed by any resolution which would ignore Jerusalem's legal and  legitimate status as part of the peace process. This could  undermine the whole peace process and bring things back to  square one in the Arab-Israeli conflict.    The contacts held between His Majesty King Husayn and  Presidents al-Asad, Mubarak, and 'Arafat and King Hassan II, as  well as the summoning by the minister of state for foreign  affairs of the ambassadors of the five permanent Security  Council member states and other council members both emanate  from the bases of the consistent Jordanian position on holy  Jerusalem. King Husayn asserted that sovereignty over Jerusalem  will only be that of God, and that Jerusalem will remain a holy  city which is yearned for by all believers in God from the three  monotheistic religions.    The inclusion in the Security Council resolution of the  condemnation of the bloody Friday events in the al-Ibrahimi  Mosque and a demand for effective international protection  measures for the defenseless Palestinian people against the  oppression of the occupation army and the Zionist extremists and  terrorists should not mean selling out the Arab character of  holy Jerusalem or relinquishing this city for the cheap price  Israel is trying to push under the aegis of the United Nations  and its Security Council through absolute U.S. support.    In view of this serious situation and the great challenge  posed to one of the holiest Arab and Islamic places, the Arab  and Islamic nations are now urged to adopt a decisive and  effective position to confront the usurpation, exclusion, and  annexation of Jerusalem by the Zionist entity.    Stemming from a sensing of the danger and feeling of  national  and pan-Arab responsibility, we appeal to the Arab and Islamic  leaders to rise to the level of this challenge and ignore all  differences, trifles, and tribal fanaticism, as well as support  the Jordanian move designed to close ranks, unify the Arab  position, and champion both Jerusalem and the Palestinian  people, who are standing fast on their land with unwavering  faith, thwarting the danger, and paying the tax of blood, souls,  and jihad, before it is too late.</p>

They are all located in China's most developed regions.    China has 32,000 km of coastline and some 300 deepwater  wharfs which can handle ships of 10,000 DWT [deadwieght ton] and  over. In the past few years, both the central and local  governments have stepped up efforts to construct ports.    The Bohai Sea Rim, the densest port group area in China, has  now more than 40 ports along its 5,800-km coast, including  Dalian, Qinhuangdao, Tianjin and Qingdao. It accounts for more  than 40 percent of the nation's port handling capacity.    More large ports, including Huanghua Port in Shandong  Province and Yingkou Port in Liaoning Province, will be enlarged  and built in the area in the coming few years.    In the Chang Jiang River Delta, one of the key construction  areas in China, a port group with Shanghai as the center has  taken shape.    So far, more than 20 well-equipped and modernized ports have  been built in the area, with more than 60 wharfs which can  handle ships of 10,000 DWT and over. The area now accounts for  about one third of the country's maritime cargo turnover.    According to local officials, the handling capacity of the  Chang Jiang River Delta will double when Shanghai Port, Nanjing  Port, Nantong Port, Beilun Port and Zhoushan Port are further  expanded or renovated.    In south China a number of deep-water ports are under  construction, apart from Guangzhou, Zhanjiang, Shantou and  Fuzhou. They will include a 100,000 DWT coal wharf, a 50,000 DWT  oil transfer wharf and a 50,000 DWT container wharf.    An international port system incorporating energy, industry  and trade is rapidly taking shape in south China.    According to China's transport departments, Qinhuangdao Port  in Hebei Province has become the largest energy transmission  port in the world. Dalian, Tianjin, Zhoushan and Beilun have  respectively become China's largest foreign trade, container,  crude oil transfer, and mineral ores and liquid petrochemical  products transfer ports.    Economists predict that nearly ten ports in China, including  Dalian, Qinhuangdao, Nanjing, Beilun, Guangzhou, Huizhou and  Zhuhai, will each have a cargo-handling capacity of more than  100 million tons by the end of the century.    At the same time, a port construction wave is surging along  the coast of the Yellow Sea.    Rizhao in east China's Shandong Province has become the  second- largest coal port in China. Jiangsu Province will also  build large transfer ports for crude oil and coal at Qidong and  Dafeng.    In addition, statistics show that ports on the Bohai Sea Rim  have set up trade relations with more than 160 countries and  regions and contribute to more than half of the country's import  and export trade volume.</p>

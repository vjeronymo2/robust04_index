			<p>920701 FT  01 JUL 92 / Hizbollah backs poll Shia Moslem fundamentalists took an important step towards the mainstream of politics yesterday when Hizbollah (Party of God) announced it would take part in Lebanon's first post-civil war general election, Reuter reports from Beirut. Syrian-backed President Elias Hrawi hopes to hold the vote within three months, although Christian hardliners are pressing for delay. Mr Samir Geagea, chief of the rightwing Christian Lebanese Forces (LF), declared yesterday his group would boycott the vote if it were held too soon. The general election will be the first since 1972.</p>

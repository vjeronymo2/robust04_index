			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Jinsheng (1728 6930 0524)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 3 Apr (XINHUA) -- The latest figures of  the State Statistics Bureau indicate that the consumer price  index [CPI] in 35 large and medium-sized cities across the  country rose 25.9 percent in February over the same period last  year. Vegetables, grains, aquatic products, meat and poultry,  and meat and poultry by-products registered the greatest price  rises, ranging from 30 to 53.5 percent. Economic experts  pointed out that authorities should take the sharp price rises  seriously. It is particularly important to firmly put a stop to  arbitrary and speculative price hikes.    The statistics for February indicate that the CPI of  "edible"  items rose 31.7 percent in the 35 large and medium-sized cities,  faster than any other categories. Of the food items,  vegetables, grain, meat and poultry, and meat and poultry  by-products saw the sharpest price rises; their prices rose by  53.5, 39.9, 31.7, and 37 percent, respectively. Next was rents,  which rose 27.8 percent, followed by services, which rose 25.8  percent. Among the major categories of consumer goods that  registered smaller price rises were transportation and  communications equipment; medical and health care; household  appliances and daily articles; recreational, educational, and  cultural products; and clothing. The price rises in all of  these categories were lower than the CPI average.    The statistics also showed the cities with a CPI higher than  the national average: Haikou, Qingdao, Urumqi, Chongqing, Hefei,  Nanjing, Ningbo, Tianjin, Dalian, Shijiazhuang, Wuhan, Nanchang,  Fuzhou, Shenyang, Guangzhou, Xiamen, Xian, and Beijing. The CPI  of these cities were between 26 to 39.3 percent. The cities  with a CPI below the national average were: Kunming, Yinchuan,  Xining, Shenzhen, Zhengzhou, Shanghai, Hohhot, Changchun,  Harbin, Hangzhou, Changsha, Guiyang, Lanzhou, Chengdu, Taiyuan,  Jinan, and Nanning. The CPI of Kunming and Shenzhen stood at  15.3 and 19 percent, the lowest.    Experts pointed out that consumer price rises are a normal  phenomenon since China started implementing the policy of reform  and opening up. Some of the prices are, however, arbitrary and  speculative; some units are seeking extraordinary profits by  unfair means to enrich their small groups, thereby severely  harming the interests of consumers. We must take resolute steps  to put a stop to and punish such irregularities. At the same  time, we should step up administration over prices, and enforce  relevant state laws and regulations to ensure that consumers'  interests are not infringed upon. This is the only way to  ensure the smooth implementation of price reform and other  reforms.</p>

			<p>931102 FT  02 NOV 93 / Iraqi N-arms 'neutralised' IRAQ'S clandestine nuclear weapons programme has either been destroyed or neutralised, with no 'big pieces' missing, Dr Hans Blix, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said yesterday, Reuter reports from New York. Dr Blix told the UN General Assembly that after 21 inspection missions gaps still had to be filled in about Iraq's nuclear supply channels and sources of scientific information. But, at a news conference following his speech, he said: 'Through a piecing together of the evidence we have found, we have a consistent and coherent picture of the nuclear programme. There are no big pieces missing.' He said declared non-irradiated highly-enriched uranium had been removed in November 1991 and a schedule set up to remove declared irradiated highly-enriched uranium. Iraq has not yet agreed to a long-term monitoring programme to ensure it does not reacquire weapons of mass destruction.</p>

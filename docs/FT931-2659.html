			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / GPA says net assets have halved GPA GROUP has told its shareholders that its net assets have more than halved, from Dollars 1.23bn to Dollars 520m (Pounds 366.1m) primarily because it has been forced to compensate aircraft manufacturers for cancelling orders. Separately it also emerged last night that banks have granted the financially troubled aircraft leasing group a further one-month waiver of breaches on its banking covenants, narrowly beating today's deadline. A financier involved in the GPA restructuring also said that the group was very close to securing banks' approval to defer Dollars 1bn of debt repayments until 1996. It has received 100 per cent votes in favour from providers of a Japanese club loan, worth Dollars 150m, and providers of an interim financing facility of Dollars 325m. On its two bigger facilities, it has received close to 100 per cent approval on one facility and almost 90 per cent on the other. This deferral of repayments is conditional on GPA succeeding in its attempt to raise Dollars 200m in new equity through a rights issue of convertible preference shares. Mr Maurice Foley, the group's deputy chairman, said that in order to satisfy the banks, GPA needs to receive firm commitments for Dollars 100m of this equity within a month and the rest within a further three months. He said that slightly more than half of the equity would have to come from new investors, because one third of its existing shareholders are too financially stretched to subscribe for the convertible shares and another 20 per cent are unlikely to do so. 'We are talking to between three and six potential investors', he said. As yet none of GPA's existing shareholders have committed themselves to taking up their rights. The restated net asset figure is included in a document sent to shareholders. Mr Foley said the net asset figure was a 'pro forma' estimate. He said that net assets could turn out to be different, 'either higher or lower', when the accounts are audited. On the basis of the estimate, net assets per share are Dollars 4.25, compared with Dollars 10.10 last March. Mr Foley said the decline also reflects provisions made to cover penalties the group would face if its fails to take delivery of aircraft.</p>

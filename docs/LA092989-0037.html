			<p><P> September 29, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Arturo Durazo, the former Mexico City police chief who was said to have made  millions of dollars from extortion, smuggling and drug dealing, was sentenced  to six years in prison on arms possession charges. Durazo, the police chief  from 1976 to 1982, has already served five years but still faces sentencing on  charges of fraud, smuggling and extortion. Durazo said he will appeal the  ruling by Judge Jose Luis Garcia Vasco. The former chief was charged with  illegally possessing 52 pistols. However, he said that as police chief he had a  right to keep weapons. Durazo fled Mexico after his friend, President Jose  Lopez Portillo, left office. FBI agents arrested him in 1984, and in 1986 he  was extradited from Los Angeles.  </P></p>

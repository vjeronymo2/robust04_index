			<p><P> December 28, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DRESSED TO THRILL;  </P> <P> RING IN THE NEW YEAR WITH FESTIVE FROCKS THAT GO FOR $100 OR LESS  </P> <P> New Year's Eve outfits for about $100 are easier to find than most women might  expect. Post-holiday markdowns help, so does some creative thinking about how  to spruce up what you already own.  </P> <P> At ClothesTime, a bargain-hunter's paradise, there are velvet cocktail dresses  for less than $40 and sweaters trimmed in gold ribbon for less than $30.  </P> <P> Other stores, including Whip Cream in the Beverly Center, have marked down some  holiday items as much as 50%. "Our customers are more cost-conscious this year,  and looking for sales," says Chris Coyle, manager of Whip Cream. Even at full  price, party fare at the store, which specializes in junior fashions, ranges  from $70 to $98.  </P> <P> For women whose budgets best fit a new accessory, not an outfit, shoe ornaments  have become a favorite wardrobe reviver. Nordstrom stores and Le Petite Jean, a  Beverly Hills shoe store, stock elegant clip-on shoe ornaments, encrusted with  faux pearls, rhinestones, bows and other trims, priced from $7.95 to $50.  </P> <P> Scarfs in festive fabrics can dress up a plain sweater, tunic or evening  jacket. At Robinson's, a solid sequined scarf by Oscar de la Renta sells for  $60.  </P> <P> Deborah Harmon, a Sherman Oaks actress, takes an imaginative approach to  accessories. She bought a large scarf in black crepe with gold soutache trim to  wear as a sarong on New Year's Eve.  </P> <P> CBS senior publicist Lori Huhn combats outfit fatigue by mixing old and new.  For this New Year's Eve, the Manhattan Beach resident and infrequent party-goer  decided to pair a new, black lace skirt with a chiffon-sleeved black jacket  already in her closet. She added a new hat to complete the ensemble. Total  investment: $80.  </P> <P> Another money-saving tip: Shop resale stores. April, a new Long Beach  consignment store, recently sold a gently worn, red wool jersey dress by Donna  Karan for $100, a fraction of the original cost.  </P> <P> For the most temporary yet trendy looks of all, rental stores such as Dressed  to Kill in West Hollywood will loan big-name designer chic for about $150. The  fee buys an evening with a Bob Mackie black velvet short cocktail dress with  gold lame trim, or a black strapless Gianni Versace cocktail number. Given the  holiday crunch, the by-appointment-only store suggests a week's notice.  </P></p>

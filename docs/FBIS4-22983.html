			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by O. S. Kropotkin, department chief in Russian </F> Federation GKRCh [expansion unknown]; first paragraph is  ELEKTROSVYAZ introduction]    [Text]Availability of mobile  communications to the people of the CIS does not exceed 10  percent of the mean level in Europe and virtually all existing  networks are used by state administration agencies. This article  describes the classification of types of mobile communications,  features of general use systems with honeycomb structure and  future satellite systems. The limitation on assigned frequency  bands compelled VAKR-92 [World Conference of Radio  Administrations] to allocate new frequency bands for development  of mobile communications.    In the last decades, there has been rapid development of  mobile ground-based and satellite communication systems in all  parts of the world. They make it possible for any mobile  subscribers to communicate with one another, use the general  communication network, transmit and receive telephone  communications and digital data. Operation of such systems  yields profit in the billions. Tens of firms all over the world  are engaged in production and assembly of equipment for them.    In view of the increasing role of mobile communication  systems, many national communication administrations are  expanding the frequency bands reserved for their operation.  Recently, additional frequency bands were also assigned in  Russia, in the range of 450 and 900 MHz, which should help  overcome the considerable lag in development of such networks in  our country, as compared to development of mobile communications  in Europe and America.    Considerably fewer radio stations are in operation in Russia  and other CIS states than in western countries (one radio  station per 100 people, which constitutes only 5-10 percent of  the European level); all networks of mobile communications are  used by state administration agencies and the ordinary citizen  is deprived of the opportunity to become a subscriber to the  mobile communications network. For this reason, there is a need  for intensive development of networks of mobile communications  accessible to all in Russia and other CIS states. The importance  of this matter lies in the considerable economic impact of its  use, as well as acceleration of furnishing telephone  communications to many regions of Russia, where availability of  telephones is quite low.    Ground-based systems of mobile radio  communications are divided into the following types:     -  general use radiotelephone systems    -  RSOP;    -  technological dispatcher networks    -  TDS;    -  personal pagers [beepers]    -  SPV;    -  emergency communication systems    -  SAS.       The RSOP is intended for communication between any mobile  subscribers, as well as their access to the municipal and  sometimes intercity network. As a rule the RSOP has one base  station (BS) that services 2000-5000 subscribers over an area  with a radius of 30-50 km. Communication between them, as well  as access to the general use network, is effected through the BS.    In recent years, all over the world there has been intense  development of RSOP with a honeycomb structure, that makes quite  efficient use of the frequency band assigned to them. In such  networks, there are several tens of BS in a city or region, each  of which operates over a radius of 1-2 km. Altogether, these BS  service 100,000-200,000 subscribers. Honeycomb networks require  more complicated equipment and software, used to control the  flow of information between BS.    TDS are intended for control of industrial operations and  technological processes in construction, agriculture, railroad  services, river fleet, municipal services of cities, systems for  control of gas line operation, power lines, etc.    SPV began to be used relatively recently, and they serve to  transmit signals from one or several BS to mobile subscribers  situated in a specific territory. They enable any subscriber to  the general telephone network to access SPV subscribers. Their  distinction is that there is no two-way communication channel.  To respond, the mobile subscriber must use a telephone,  telegraph or any other available channel. SPV are often  organized by means of multiplexing the FM UHF channels of  broadcast transmitters with radio access signals in the pauses  between transmissions. The range of SPV is 30-40 km, and it  serves 10,000-20,000 subscribers. There are systems for not only  individual, but also group paging.    SAS are used by state administration agencies, and have been  developed the most in the maritime and aviation services, where  they are used to transmit distress signals, including automatic  ones.    In CIS states, 10 frequency bands have been assigned to  mobile communication systems: I (1.6-30 MHz); II (33-48.5 MHz);  III (57-57.25 MHz); IV (74-74.6 MHz); V (75.4-76 MHz); VI  (146-174 MHz); VII (300-308 MHz); VIII (336-344 MHz); IX  (451-466 MHz) and X (890-960 MHz). These bands are used not only  by mobile communication systems, but also other radio systems.  For this reason, assignment of frequencies for a new network  presents a serious problem, and it is resolved by communications  agencies in each specific instance.    These 10 bands are divided mainly according to type of  mobile  communications: I-VIII are used in TDS networks; I-VI in SPV. As  a rule, band I is used to organize long-distance communications  in inaccessible regions; band II is one of the most used, since  hundreds of thousands of radio stations of various departmental  networks (emergency medical aid, militia, etc.); band III is  intended for organization of intraplant [intrafarm] and  intraregional communications in rural regions; bands IV and V  are used essentially to organize communications at construction  sites; the networks for railroad technological communications,  as well as services of the petroleum and gas industries and  electric power complex, operate in bands VI and VII.    RSOP uses bands VII and IX, and the latter band was assigned  recently to deploy, for example, the honeycomb systems in Moscow  and St. Petersburg, which were assembled using NMT-450 equipment  purchased abroad. The question of using band X in Russia must be  resolved in the near future. It is planned to develop RSOP using  the latest equipment of the general European GSM standard, which  operates in the frequency ranges of 450 and 900 MHz. On the one  hand, this will provide subscribers with a wide range of  services and, on the other hand, it will permit quite efficient  use of the frequency band assigned to mobile communications, so  that networks with a large number of subscribers can be  organized. In CIS states alone, we expect a 10-15-fold increase  in number of mobile radio stations.    The GSM system, use of which has already begun in FRG,  France, Italy, Great Britain and other countries, was developed  by a team of experts in mobile communications of the European  organization SEPT.[.sup]1[/] It is expected that the network  of this system will cover 10 million subscribers by 1995 and 15  million by the year 2000. In addition to new services related to  digital transmission of signals, GSM provide for privacy of  communications.    Considering the prospects for development of industry and  agriculture in Russia and the fact that it is moving closer to  the European market, it should be conceded that it is desirable  to have speedy development of this system in Russia. For this  reason, we can only welcome the production of equipment for the  900 MHz range planned by several Russian enterprises.    The PCN[.sup]2[/] [Personal Communications Network] system  will be another promising international system of mobile  communications, and several Russian enterprises are undertaking  production of equipment for it.    Satellite systems of mobile communications (SSS)  are an effective means of organizing communications in the  maritime, air and ground services.    Commercial operation of SSS was started in 1982 by the  international organization INMARSAT, which comprises more than  50 countries including Russia. Stations for this system,  designed to provide for maritime and aircraft communications,  can be installed on trucks that make long-distance runs,  railroad cars, aircraft and vessels. At the present time, the  system services up to 700 ships cruising in the Atlantic, Indian  and Pacific oceans. Communications are established via a  geostationary IS3 [artificial satellite] and stationary  ground-based station. The system uses ranges of 6 and 4 GHz  (coastal ground-based stations), 1.6 and 1.5 GHz (ship- and  aircraft-based stations). The annual income to the INMARSAT  organization is about 160 US dollars.    INMARSAT provides the following types of services:  telephone,  telegraph and fax communications, transmission of data,  reception of signals from satellite radio navigation systems.  Since 1992, personal radio paging is also provided, which  permits INMARSAT users to receive brief texts displayed on a  monitor by means of a personal device weighing 400 g.    National SSS systems are being developed in many countries  of  the world. In the United States, for example, it is planned to  start up a system in 1995 that will service up to 270,000 users  with the possibility of accessing the general telephone network.  This system will provide for transmission of data and  organization of dispatcher communications, in addition to  ordinary telephone communications.    In Russia, the Marafon -- a specialized national satellite  system for land, sea and air mobile communications -- is being  developed with consideration of the INMARSAT experience. Marafon  will satisfy the acute need of our country for mobile  communications in all types of transportation, and it will  resolve the problem of providing reliable communications to the  most remote and inaccessible regions.    It is planned to start up the first line of this system in  1993 for 2000 subscribers, and their number will reach 50,000 by  the year 2000. The cost of the system should be returned after  9-11 years of operation.    Satellite systems of scanning radio paging with subscriber  receivers the size of a credit card have gained wide use in the  last few years. The low-cost receivers can operate out of doors,  in buildings and vehicles. Since 1986, such a system has been  undergoing test operation in Great Britain, and it permits  paging truck drivers on the roads of West Europe, the Mideast  and Africa.    In the United States, a satellite system of scanning radio  paging has been put in operation, and it services more than 50  major cities in that country. Many regional ground-based radio  paging services in the United States are integrated by means of  space communication channels.    One of the main factors retarding RSOP development is the  limited radio frequency spectrum. Considerable difficulties are  involved in assignment of additional parts of the spectrum for  RSOP, and for this reason almost half the items (9 out of 21) on  the agenda of the World Conference of Radio Administrations on  Assignment of Frequency Bands (VAKR-92) had a direct bearing on  this problem.    In the relevant Table of Band Assignment of the  International  Radio Communications Regulations, there are are virtually no  frequency bands assigned on an exclusive basis to the mobile  service (with the exception of maritime and air mobile services  directly related to providing for safety of human life). In  addition to spectrum overloading, this circumstance limits the  possibility of meeting the needs for organization of mobile  radio communications.    For this reason, it was conceded at the VAKR-92 that it is  imperative to broaden the spectrum for mobile services, and  discussions arose only on different details of the problem, in  particular, matters of compatibility of mobile services with,  for example, the stationary service already using these parts of  the spectrum.    The conference approved the decision to raise the status of  the mobile service to a primary rank in the 1700-2450 MHz band.  The Russian delegation proposed limitation to a 1710-2110 Mhz  band since the 1700-1710 MHz band is used extensively to receive  meteorological information from satellites, the 2110-2450 MHz  band is needed for the stationary service (radio relay lines),  while the 2200-2290 MHz segment is needed for space-earth and  space-space communication lines in space research services. In  the opinion of Russian specialists, questions of electromagnetic  compatibility of the mobile service with these important  stationary services have not been sufficiently explored. Since  the same apprehensions were voiced by other delegations, VAKR-92  asked MKKR [International Radio Consultative Committee] to  investigate the problem of compatibility of these services and  develop the technical criteria for joint use of frequencies.    The VAKR-92 assigned the frequency bands of 1670-1675 MHz  (ground-aircraft) and 1800-1805 MHz (aircraft-ground) to  administrations thatwish to use such systems for communications  with aircraft. In Canada, the United States and Mexico, 849-851  and 894-896 MHz bands, respectively, are already being used for  such purposes. Thus, a dual set of onboard equipment will be  needed on aircraft that will fly between zones with different  frequency assignments.    At the VAKR-92, assignment of spectrum segments for  satellite  mobile services was the subject of the main discussions. This is  attributable to the fact that the typical distinction of the  present stage of using space communications equipment is the  desire to make broad use of nongeostationary, including  low-orbit, satellites. The reason for this is that the  feasibility of using a geostationary orbit is close to being  saturated in several ranges, and geostationary satellites in  circumpolar regions are not very efficient because of the small  angles at which radiowaves reach ground stations. Systems with  low-orbit satellites also have higher power characteristics of  communication lines, which is particularly important when using  cheap portable ground-based terminals with nondirectional  antennas.    Lengthy discussions revolved around several specific parts  of  the spectrum, which it was proposed to assign to the satellite  mobile service, which uses nongeostationary earth satellites:  137-138 MHz, 148-149.9 MHz, 149.9-150.05 MHz, 400.15-401 MHz,  and 1610-1626.5 MHz. The 137-138 MHz band was divided into 4  segments, and the satellite mobile service (space-earth) was  assigned the 137-137.025 MHz and 137.175-137.825 MHz segments on  a primary basis, 137.025-137.175 MHz and 137.825-138 MHz on a  secondary basis.    Such separation of the band was made because of the fear of  several countries, including the Russian Federation, Belarus and  Ukraine, as well as SEPT nations, that this new service could  create problems in using existing ground-based mobile services.  The 148-149.9 and 400.15-401 MHz frequency bands were assigned  to the satellite mobile service on a primary basis. Limits were  set for power flow density near the earth's surface in the  137-138, 148-149.9 and 400.15-401 MHz bands to protect existing  ground-based services. These bands are permitted for use only by  nongeostationary satellite systems, provided steps are taken to  protect radioastronomic observations in the 150.05-153 and  406.1-410 MHz frequency bands.    At the suggestion of the Russian Federation, Belarus and  Ukraine, a satellite mobile service was included on a secondary  basis in the 312-315 MHz (earth-space) and 387-390 MHz  (space-earth) bands. This permits development of Gonets [racer],  a Russian system of satellite mobile communications, was  included in the Table of Frequency Assignment of the Radio  Communications Regulations on a secondary basis, and it will now  be rid of the complicated coordination procedure that is  mandatory for all analogous services in the 235-322 and  335.4-339.9 MHz frequency bands.    At the VAKR-92, it was decided to distribute 50 MHz at a  time  in each direction to the satellite mobile service, scheduled to  be done by 1 January 2005, to meet its growing needs. In the  meantime, there are several problems to be solved concerning  control of reciprocal interference between the satellite mobile  service and existing ground-based services.    There was particularly sharp discussion of suggestions on  assignment of the 1610-1626.5 MHz band to the satellite mobile  surface. A suggestion was advanced by the United States that  proposed the use of this band for development of a global system  of mobile communications. One of the plans of the Motorola firm  proposes to develop a system of 77 low-obit satellites at an  altitude of 770 km in circumpolar orbits. Each satellite with 37  pencil beams would generate 37 coverage areas [``honeycombs'']  each about 670 km in diameter near earth's surface. On a global  scale, total carrying capacity of the system will be 377,000  duplex telephone channels (240 channels per honeycomb).    In its report to the VAKR-92, the MKKR concluded that the  frequency bands for air and maritime radio communications and  radio navigation that are related to assuring safety of human  life should not be viewed as candidates for satellite mobile  services. The conference, however, disregarded this conclusion  and, under pressure of the U.S. delegates, adopted the proposed  decision.    In order to protect the GLONASS system, the Russian  delegation was compelled to record a special statement in the  concluding minutes of the VAKR-92.    On the whole, the decisions of the VAKR-92 pertaining to  mobile services are indicative of the increasing interest in new  types of communications, mainly for general use.  Footnotes    1.

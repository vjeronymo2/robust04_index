			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / People: Solotec John Howell, chief executive of Teesside Training and Enterprise council, is moving south to become chief executive of Solotec, the Training and Enterprise council for Bexley, Bromley, Croydon and Sutton. Howell, 49, has been running the Middlesbrough-based TEC since April 1991. While his predecessor had been seconded from the civil service, Howell came from Singer UK, where he had been managing director. His new post, which he takes up in October, represents a move back to his roots, for Howell went to school in this part of south London, and still has family living in the area. Chris Hubbard, who had been Solotec's chief executive since its launch in 1991, returned to the mainstream civil service in June. Since his departure, David Phelan, previously operations director with British Gas South Eastern, has been acting chief executive.</p>

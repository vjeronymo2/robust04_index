			<p>Language: <F P=105> Finnish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Alarming Trend"] </F>   [Text] According to the latest HS [HELSINGIN  SANOMAT]-Gallup poll, in November the number of us opposing EU  [European Union] membership was for the first time greater than  the number of supporters of membership. The gap is not yet  significant, but the development trend is alarming from the  standpoint of prospects for membership. The percentage of  respondents uncertain of where they stand on the issue was  noticeably large throughout this period, nearly a fourth of them.    Opposition to EU membership in Sweden and especially in  Norway is still considerably stronger than here among us. This  is why the change might have been anticipated. While it is  premature to speak of a lasting change on the basis of a single  poll, public opinion seems to be seriously confused with regard  to the wisdom of EU membership. The number of opponents has not  very significantly increased during the past year, but many  supporters have at least become doubters. The EC Commission's  harsh stance on agriculture certainly led to an increase in the  percentage of both doubters and opponents.    It is hard to say how much the different Aho government  ministers' wavering or contradictory positions on membership or  the superficiality of the debate have influenced the development  of public opinion. Opposition to it has grown in Sweden, even  though the government as well as the opposition single-mindedly  support the membership negotiations. In Sweden the reason for  the increase in opposition to the EU has been sought in the fact  that [in the negotiations] they have gotten too bogged down in  various problematic details and can therefore no longer see the  forest for the trees.    Citizens' confusion at this point in the negotiations is  understandable. If their confusion is prolonged, more of them  than before may switch to opposition to membership. The  government must convince citizens that it knows what it wants  and do everything it can in the nation's interests in the  negotiations. This does not mean inflexible intransigence.  Hopefully, it will suffice for the end result of the  negotiations to be "reasonable," that is, as favorable as it is  possible to achieve. There has been much too little discussion  on alternatives to EU memberships.</p>

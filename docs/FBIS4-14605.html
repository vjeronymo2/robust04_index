			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Kutakhov] </F>   [Text] Tokyo March 31 TASS -- The Russian Parliament  believes that its foreign policy should not be oriented only at  the West. It should also vigorously develop ties with countries  of the Asia-Pacific region, specificaly with Japan, Mikhail  Poltoranin, chairman of the Committee on Information Policy and  Communications in the State Duma of the Federal Assembly, said  in an exclusive interview to ITAR-TASS on Thursday [31 March].  He arrived in Tokyo at the invitation of the Japanese  Parliament.    Poltoranin said priority in this area should be given to  contacts at regional level rather than to the development of  interstate ties where there is more bureaucratism and inertia.  The initiative of local government bodies should be encouraged  for which they should be given more rights and greater freedom,  Poltoranin said. He said there is a need for caution in the  approach to this process so as not to upset the balance between  federal structures and local authorities and not to set in  motion centrifugal forces.    Poltoranin told ITAR-TASS that he is to meet Japanese  Premier  Morihiro Hosokawa and other Japanese leaders during his visit.  "I am going to tell the head of the cabinet that it is time for  Japan to recover form slumber so as not to lag behind other  states, competitors, that now begin to do business with Russia,"  Poltoranin said. To attract foreign partners, the Russian  Parliament embarked on drafting a solid legal basis guaraneeing  protection for foreign investment. A number of draft laws will  be completed in April or May.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 10 Apr (DPA) -- Thousands of Mexicans  marched today in the capital city to commemorate revolutionary  peasant Emiliano Zapata, murdered 75 years ago.    With a march along Reforma Central Avenue to the Zocalo, the  demonstration -- which included peasant organizations from all  over Mexico as well as leftist groups based in the capital city  -- also protested the reforms made to Article 27 of the Mexican  Constitution which now allows the privatization of the so called  "land tenures" [ejidos].    Zapata, born in the State of Morelos, south of Mexico City,  was a leading figure during the Mexican revolution (1910-1917).  He became famous as a result of his cry "land and liberty" as  well as because he demanded the distribution of large estates  among the peasants. He was murdered in an ambush on 10 April  1919.    Since this Mexican revolutionary and national hero's name  was  adopted by the Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN), some  of the protesters openly expressed their support for the Chiapas  guerrilla group that took up arms on 1 January 1994. Several of  the signs held by the protesters read: "Zapata lives in the  EZLN." Other signs carried the revolutionary hero's image, and  expressed support for a "Government by the EZLN, the workers,  peasants, and people's organizations." In addition to shouts  such as "Here, there, Zapata will prevail," there were also  shouts condemning the North American Free Trade Agreement  (NAFTA) between Mexico, the United States, and Canada which  entered into effect this year.    In the meantime, during a commemoration ceremony that took  place at the Topanzolco Municipal Auditorium in Morelos,  President Carlos Salinas de Gortari said that many of Zapata's  aspirations have come through. "However, Mexico changed, new  problems arose as well as new opportunities, the Mexican rural  sector changed, and our peasants also changed," Salinas pointed  out in justifying the much criticized reforms to Article 27 of  the Constitution which now allows the privatization of state  land tenures established by the Mexican agrarian reform.    The president highlighted that "prior to modifying Article  27  of the Constitution, we proceeded to discuss it exhaustively  with the peasant organizations." Likewise, the president ruled  out fears related to the reappearance of large estates. "The  large estates will not reappear, they disappeared from our  country's history," the president indicated.</p>

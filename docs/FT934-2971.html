			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / International Company News: James Hardie falls to ADollars 19.5m after six months James Hardie, the Australian building materials group, yesterday reported a slump in first-half profit after tax and abnormals to ADollars 19.5m (USDollars 13m) in the six months to end-September, writes Nikki Tait in Sydney. This compared with ADollars 30.2m in the same period of 1992. Abnormal items accounted for ADollars 7.7m, against nil last time. Operating revenues were ADollars 822.5m, compared with ADollars 723.9m. Mr John Reid, chairman, blamed the fall in interim profits on a flattening-out in the building market.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] In Port-au-Prince, the provisional government  protested against statements made by President Bill Clinton of  the United States. The government of Judge Emile Jonassaint  raised a vigorous protest against President Clinton's recent  statements, according to which Haiti is located in the United  States' backyard.    Such untimely statements clearly violate the cardinal and  universal principles of sovereignty and self-determination that  govern relations among nations, writes the Ministry of  Information in a press release. The land of Haiti is not and  will never be the backyard of any state, not even of the world's  most powerful, continues the government press release which also  denounces the unspeakable behavior of unnatural sons of the  homeland who, obsessed with the passion of power, offer the  country's detractors an opportunity to degrade it.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Nan Shih-yin (2809 4258 0936): "Inside Story About </F> Jiang, Li, Zhu in 1994 Reform"]    [Text] In March 1994, various reform measures were put  into effect in China, and various events happened before and  after the adoption of these measures causing ripples to spread  all through the society. This proved the prediction of some  experts: In the year of reform, contradictions in relations  will appear. How will the Chinese authorities react? Will they  make further advances or withdraw? Various signals have  attracted attention from all quarters concerned, because the  orientation of reform has been continuously discussed by people  outside the mainland since last autumn.    This year, China's economic train will continue to run at a  high speed, and the growth rate may even exceed the high figures  of the two previous years. This was predicted by many Chinese  economic experts.    Both the predictions of experts and the official statistics  showed that industrial production in the first quarter of this  year would continue to increase rapidly, and it was expected  that the total industrial output value would increase by 22  percent over the same period last year. Up to the end of  January, the total industrial output value increased by 33.2  percent over the same period last year. The State Information  Center revealed more startling figures: Since February 1992,  the industrial output value had almost always remained at a  level above 20 percent, and in December 1993, the increase rate  jumped sharply by 10.9 percentage points to 29.8 percent, with  the average daily output being 1.48 billion yuan above that in  the previous month.    The figures were the main grounds on which the economic  experts predicted high-speed economic growth in China this year.  Some experts predicted that it was very likely that the Chinese  economy would grow at a rate much higher than the government  target of around 9 percent. Such runaway economic growth  makes people worry that the constraints of the "bottleneck" will  become more serious, the economic efficiency will remain low,  there will be excessive demand for resources, and such a  strained economic environment will make it very difficult to  implement reform.    Another characteristic of China's economic development this  year was that prices remained high. According to the prediction  of some experts, the volume of retail sales in the first quarter  of this year may increase by 28.6 percent over the same period  last year, and the retail price index will reach 14.5 percent.  Both figures will be higher than last year's average.    In 1993, retail prices in China increased by 13.2 percent,  and the living costs in 35 large and medium-sized cities  increased by 20 percent. The margins of increase were not only  bigger than those in 1992, but also marked the highest record in  recent years. In fact, the retail price index in mainland China  has already exceeded the warning line of inflation, and in the  35 cities it has exceeded the warning line of serious inflation.  The inertia of inflation and sustained high-speed growth in  1993 will continue to have an impact on this year's inflation  situation.    A pronounced characteristic of inflation last year in China  was that the prices of producer goods increased by a much wider  margin than the price increases of consumer goods. It was  expected that the prices of producer goods would increase by  about 35 percent over the whole year. The increase in the  prices of producer goods then raised the production costs of  consumer goods. Moreover, the prices of some energy products  and agricultural products will be raised this year, and the  prices of some commodities will be shifted from a low,  plan-fixed level to a high, market-determined level. Consumers  also anticipated the aggravation of inflation and began to  react. All this makes it easy to imagine how great the inflation  pressure will be in 1994.    The continuing, huge investment in fixed assets is closely  related to the inflation situation. According to Beijing  economist Wen Tiejun's prediction, the size of investment in  fixed assets in the whole country will increase by at least 50  percent over last year, and the investment will mainly be  concentrated in the real estate and construction industry.    Official Chinese statistics showed that, between January and  September 1993, the investment in fixed assets made by  state-owned units increased by 66.4 percent over that in the  same period in the previous year, and the growth rates in the  coastal areas were almost all above 60 percent, with some  exceeding 100 percent. In 1993 the overall size of investment  in fixed assets in the whole country exceeded 1.15 trillion  yuan, or increased by more than 300 billion yuan (47 percent)  over the previous year; the growth rate of investment made by  state-owned enterprises was 58 percent; the investment rate [tou  zi lu 2121 6327 376] increased to 37 percent; and the gross  volume of investment in 1993 was more than double that in 1991  and reached the highest level in 15 years. This was obviously  an abnormal condition. A more worrisome fact was that there was  a nearly 30 billion yuan investment fund shortage, and the  economic results of the investment were rather poor. The rate  of utilization of fixed assets declined by 5.5 percentage points  from 1992. The proportion of agricultural investment dropped  from 2.8 percent to 2.2 percent, that of investment in the  energy and raw material industries dropped from 39.5 percent to  35.6 percent, and the constraints of the "bottleneck" still  existed to a serious degree.    In particular, in the last three months of 1993, China's  money supply was loosened, and nearly 300 billion yuan of credit  was made available. This not only enabled the state-owned  enterprises to quicken the circulation of their funds, but also  stimulated their investment desire. In some localities, people  had a stronger desire for expanding investment, and tried to  quicken the pace of investment in fixed assets.    Only one month after the Third Session of the 14th CPC  Central Committee adopted the "50-point Decision on the Market  Economy," the prices of grain, cooking oil, and meat increased  sharply in various localities. According to the price  monitoring organs in 12 cities, the price of mixed grain  increased by 3.8 percent, the price of nonglutinous rice  increased by 8 percent, the price of polished long-grain rice  increased by 9.1 percent, and the average grain price increased  by about 30 percent in the whole year. In the last few months  of 1993, the prices of cooking oil and meat increased rapidly.  Over the whole year, the average price of cooking oil increased  by 35 percent, and that of meat increased by about 20 percent.  For example, the price of rape seed oil increased from 4.08  yuan per kg in early 1993 to 6.08 yuan per kg at the end of the  year, and price of fresh boneless meat increased from 7.03 yuan  per kg to 9.55 yuan. Panic shopping ensued in some localities,  and people contended with each other to buy as much grain and  cooking oil as they could. This resulted in shortages in many  places.    Immediately after that, the authorities decided to unify the  two sets of foreign exchange rates. Some hotels and restaurants  took advantage of this opportunity to raise their charges and  prices, and this spread panic among customers. The move of  unifying foreign exchange rates also made it possible to further  decontrol the prices of crude oil and oil products, and this  produced chain effects on other commodities and further  increased consumers' anticipatory feeling against inflation. In  Beijing, many consumers rushed to buy gold.    Then came the reform of the taxation system, and this  flustered more people in China. Before people really understood  the meaning of such new terms as consumption taxes and  value-added taxes, rumors about "a substantial increase in the  prices of luxurious and durable consumer goods and even all  commodities due to the state's collection of special consumption  taxes and value-added taxes" were spread rapidly and widely  among the general public. As a result, another round of panic  shopping appeared before the Chinese New Year. In Beijing alone  the total volume of retail sales in December 1993 reached 5.42  billion yuan, an increase of 30.5 percent over the same period  of the previous year, and this was also an all-time high for  monthly retail sales.    The three strong winds swept across many places of the  mainland, and added another layer of frost to the icy situation  of the inflation pressure.    At the beginning of the new year, the situation in China's  economic reform was rather stern, and things had an unfavorable  start. The high growth rate, high investment rate, and high  inflation rate all continued, and were not any milder than the  situation in 1993. The three gusts of wind also showed that if  there were any loopholes in the implementation of the reform  measures, which must be well-coordinated, some major trouble  would be brought about, especially because the reform measures  were put into practice when the "three high rates" existed and  when the risks were increasing. Reportedly, the CPC top leaders  made a sober assessment of the situation in 1994, the year of  reform.    The CPC leadership took a number of resolute measures to  cope  with the situation. The three top leaders, General Secretary  Jiang Zemin, Premier Li Peng, and Vice Premier Zhu Rongji  personally took up the matter of curbing the price hikes. At  the year end national meeting on stabilizing grain and  cooking-oil prices, Premier Li Peng announced a number of urgent  measures to check the price hikes. Before the Chinese New Year,  Jiang Zemin inspected Beijing's retail markets. He asked shop  assistants what commodities became more expensive and how much  the prices had increased and whether the prices were lowered to  a reasonable level. Zhu Rongji went to Fujian and Anhui to make  an inspection tour. He pointed out many times that "some people  thought there was no need to manage the grain prices after they  were decontrolled, and this was a misunderstanding of the market  economy." He hoped that shops would lower grain prices to a  level specified by the state plan, and would further lower  prices before the Chinese New Year so that there would be  greater room for maneuvering in this year's price adjustments.  The State Planning Commission, the Ministry of Internal Trade,  the State Economic and Trade Commission, and the State Grain  Reserve Bureau jointly took action to check the price hikes of  grain, cooking oil, and meat. After that, the State Council  once again held a national work conference on the supply of  grain, cooking oil, and meat. Li Peng required the local  governments to "actually give top priority to the improvement of  the people's livelihood." On the one hand, the CPC top  leadership drew a lesson from the problems, and "adopt effective  macrocontrol measures" to curb inflation and stabilize prices.  On the other hand, the authorities also tried hard to reduce  people's misgivings about the reform measures through various  channels as such misgivings increased after the abrupt increase  in grain, cooking-oil, and meat prices.    When the new reform measures were put into practice, there  were risks, especially as the situation of the "three high  rates" was stern and worrisome. All this showed that, as the  reform deepened, it would certainly be facing unprecedented  contradictions and certain difficulties. Many problems that  piled up under the old system would impact the course of the  across-the-board reform and would obstruct the adjustment of the  interest pattern. The inflation pressure, the recession of the  state-owned enterprises, and the increase in the jobless  population would all create a dilemma for the top authorities:  If they continue to expand the scale of investment in order to  stimulate the economy and improve the business condition of  enterprises, the people will face increasing inflation pressure.  If they reduce the issuance of currency and tighten up money  supply, the state-owned enterprises will once again be bogged  down in the mire of chained debts. If they further the radical  reforms, which will affect the vested interests of various  social strata, various localities, and various departments, this  may bring about social turbulence and thus endanger social  stability. But if they are overcautious and even try too hard  to maintain stability, they will effectively end the reform.    At the same time, facts also remind people that first, the  risks from reform come primarily from the problems of the old  system, so in order to reduce risks, the only way is to  substantially advance reform. Second, it has become more and  more important to maintain stability, because nothing will be  accomplished in reform and economic development if there is no  stability and the people will have to pay even heavier costs.  Third, the feasibility and proper arrangements of the reform  measures have also become more and more important. In these  eventful days, it is no longer possible to advance reform in any  single field, and there must be no major mistakes in the  implementation of the reform measures. However, differences  exist between the central authorities and the local authorities.  Some local governments are overanxious to quicken the pace of  reform and to speed up economic development. They even  misunderstood Deng Xiaoping's remark that "development is the  last word."    Therefore, in the past, senior officials in Beijing often  discussed the approach to the relationships between reform,  development, and stability and the way to deepen the reform. It  is said that all this caused deep concern in Zhongnanhai.    Zhu Rongji was the first to call for: Grasping the  opportunity, deepening the reform, promoting development, and  maintaining stability. Li Ruihuan, another member of the CPC  Central Political Bureau, pointed out: Reform is the driving  force, stability is the precondition, and development is the  objective. Li Peng pointed out: Development is the aim, reform  is the driving force, and stability is the precondition. He  also said: Reform will be further deepened, and the scale of  opening up to the outside world will be further expanded. Then,  before the Chinese New Year, Jiang Zemin made the final  decision on the general guideline for this year's work:  Grasping the opportunity, deepening the reform, expanding  opening, promoting development, and maintaining stability.    These 20 characters give much food for thought. First,  reform, development, and stability are arranged in a certain  sequence, and deepening reform is placed first. The three  things will be coordinated and integrated in a dialectical way.  Second, the word "quickening" is not put before the words  "reform" and "development," but this does not mean that reform  and development need not be quickened. Instead, the key point  in this year's work is to ensure coordinated operations in the  aspects of reform, development, and stability. Third,  importance is attached to stability. Fourth, stress is laid on  grasping the opportunity. Undoubtedly, seeking a prudent path  of reform, opening, development, and stability is the core of  the 20-character guideline.    Zhu Rongji, who continued to play a role as a  trouble-shooter  in the CPC top leadership in recent years, recently once again  took resolute action to deal with some difficult problems.    According to the 20-character guideline laid down by Jiang  Zemin, this year's guideline for the monetary work in China is:  Continue to rectify the monetary order, steadily advance the  monetary reform, strictly control the gross quality of credit  funds, and effectively exercise monetary management and  supervision. Before the Chinese New Year, Zhongnanhai  eventually formulated the macrocontrol principle for this year's  economic operation: First tightening control and then relaxing  control, and pursuing an economic policy for "a high growth rate  and intensive operation."    Whether or not the size of investment in fixed assets is  reasonable is a key factor for determining whether China's  economy is able to maintain stable growth and prevent serious  inflation. Zhu Rongji precisely decided to take action on  this point. The "monetary commander-in-chief" issued an order:  "Beginning this year, the credit funds for infrastructural  facilities and key projects in basic industries will all be  arranged and coordinated by the newly established Development  Bank of the state;" "No loan will be offered to projects going  beyond the gross size of credit, to projects which are started  without the approval of the authorities, and to any projects  which are turned from a whole to parts; and not even one single  penny can be given to any one such project." RENMIN RIBAO  also published a commentator's article to cool down the  excessive enthusiasm of the local authorities for increasing  investment.    Reportedly, when told that a province planned to build more  than 10 airports this year, Zhu Rongji was very angry and  openly blamed some local officials for being "unrealistic."  Sources said that he was determined to keep the size of  investment in fixed assets below 1,450 billion yuan. At the  same time, the State Council issued a red-headed document,  ordering the local authorities and the relevant departments to  strictly scrutinize new construction projects and shorten the  front of construction. The State Planning Commission then  formulated the concrete measure for turning enterprises into  investment bodies. According to the measure, construction  projects will not be started until legal persons are formed, and  legal persons will take full responsibility for the whole  process of investment. The corporation responsibility system  will be adopted in order to change the situation in which  investment results are poor and no people are responsible for  investment. The top authorities are also quickening the  process of investment legislation.    Thus, according to the speculation of the experts in the  State Information Center, the pace of investment growth in fixed  assets will be temporarily slowed, and capital construction  investment made by state-owned units in the first quarter of  this year will be 36 percent, which is slightly lower than last  year's average. At the same time, however, the State Council  will increase investment in basic industries in order to prevent  the situation from exceeding the limits in adjustments.    On the other hand, Zhu Rongji also made great efforts to  advance taxation reform. This indicated that the financial  system in China would enter a new path; the new taxation system  will become a mechanism for stabilizing the growth in central  finances and will increase the macrocontrol capacity of the  central policies; the local authorities will pay more attention  to fostering tax sources; and the state budgets will certainly  play a tougher controlling role and the results of financial  expenditure will be gradually enhanced. In order to give  stronger guidance to taxation reform, the State Council decided  that Finance Minister Li Zhongli was concurrently appointed to  be director of the State Administration of Taxation, and Jin  Xin, former director of the taxation administration, was  appointed to be deputy director (remaining at the  full-ministerial level). Six sets of taxation rules were put  into practice on a trial basis. In order to remove consumers'  misgivings, Jin Xin led taxation officials to the streets to  explain the new tax rules to the general public. Before the  Chinese New Year, six ministerial- level officials gave a series  of lectures through CCTV, and the first lecturer was Jin Xin.    Various signs showed that the Chinese authorities had  gradually replaced administrative control with market regulation  and control. The most effective means of economic control was  the issuance of currency and the retrieval of currency from  circulation. The two major economic levers, the interest rates  and the tax rates, were also used to adjust economic  development. It seemed that Zhu Rongji was learning key skills  through practice, and was trying to bring the runaway economy  under effective control. Sources in Beijing said that Zhu  Rongji and other officials had always tried to bring the rate of  economic growth and the index of inflation below 10 percent. If  they achieve this target, the economic environment for China's  reforms in the second half of 1994 will become much more  favorable. Changing from "urgently applying the brake" to a  "soft landing," the mainland economy may be free from the  repetition of a "hard landing" as in previous years.    Recent facts showed that the CPC top leadership was  adjusting  some specific steps promptly in order to cope with the stern  situation. Some reform measures may be postponed, but this does  not mean that the authorities will backtrack from reform.    There were four main aspects in recent adjustments:  Exercising macrocontrol in order to prevent major ups and downs  and to create a more benign environment for the adoption of new  reform measures; prudently advancing reform and development to  make steady and solid progress and to prevent major errors;  improving the reform plans and ensuring that they are  well-coordinated and feasible and are put into practice in  opportune moments; preventing reckless action across the board  and ensuring solid results in reform and development. Recently,  Zhu Rongji particularly pointed out: "The reform orientation of  changing the specialized banks into commercial banks must be  kept firmly, but this is a long-term task and only the first  step will be taken this year. There must be no reckless action  across the board [bu yao gua feng 0008 6008 0450 7364]. The  remark reflected the intention of the CPC top leaders to  postpone certain reform measures.    Some economic experts commented positively on the CPC top  authorities' adjustment steps, and said that this was a  pragmatic and feasible approach. Most of them held that when  facing the dilemma, the authorities should not recklessly  advance or flinch from difficulty, and the sensible approach at  the current stage was to make minor adjustments and make stable  and solid development.    Of course they also found that, in the course of developing  the market economy, some reform measures were changed shortly  after they were put into practice, and brought about various  abnormal phenomena as a result of various backward economic  relations caused by the combination between the disadvantages of  the planned economy and the disadvantages of the market economy.  Therefore, economist Fang Hengshan, who participated in the  formulation of the "50-point" document on the market economy,  openly issued an urgent call for solving this problem. The  experts held that at this moment, the adjustment of the reform  steps would be favorable to removing the misunderstanding of the  market economy and the reform measures in some localities and  departments. At the same time, they also warned the authorities  against softening their determination for reform while facing  various difficulties. Although reform is facing increasing  risks, the risks would be even greater if reform were not  carried out. Economist Wu Jinglian held that fighting  fragmentary battles outside the establishment was not cheaper.  Economist Wen Tiejun held that the impact of various factors  might force the process of reform to slow down this year.    The general view of China's economic situation before the  Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress clearly  showed the intention of Zhongnanhai: This year, economic reform  should mainly lay a solid foundation for the across-the-board  adoption of the market economy and for more intensive reforms  between 1994 and 1996 in order to achieve the objective of  establishing the market economic structure on a full scale by  the end of 1996. The efforts to carry out prudent reforms and  to make effective development will exist throughout the whole  process of the tough reform battles in 1994.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Paid advertisement by the General Command of the Guatemalan </F> National Revolutionary Unity, place and date not given: "The  Situation and Resettlement of the Population Displaced by the  Armed Conflict"]    [Text] Being forced to leave one's land, place of origin,  home, and natural and social surroundings is no doubt one of the  most painful dramas that can happen to a person, a family, and a  community. If violence and repression force them to seek  survival and run for their lives in the midst of ferocious  extermination campaigns, the scope and drama of this situation  is then unmeasurable.    It is an exodus of sorrow and bitterness. It is a march  amidst terror and huge uncertainty. It is to walk not knowing  where, leaving everything behind, abandoning everything obtained  through the hard work of a lifetime. The tales, testimonies,  and descriptions of those who one day had to leave propelled by  anxiety and harassment will never tell the whole story. They  watched their homes burn down. They died along the way or had  to start their lives again overwhelmed by sadness and longing  for the past.    The scope of the people who were displaced by the repression  should be carefully considered. One must recall and clearly  state the motives behind the displacements, determine the  consequences of these displacements, and seek solutions. In  Guatemala, the displacement started with the scorched earth  strategy and genocide the army carried out in large areas of the  country during the 1980's. This policy later became  consolidated with the repressive mechanisms of control over the  population, the establishment of concentration camps,  euphemistically called model towns or development centers.    The direct, repressive, and brutal actions against the  civilian population is what causes the phenomenon of refugees,  people displaced internally, or resistant communities.  Altogether or separately, they constitute problems of a truly  terrifying scope in terms of quantity and quality.    The URNG [Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity] thinks  the  situation of the displaced population (refugees, people  displaced internally, and resistant communities) must be viewed  in its overall context, although we must seek specific solutions  that at any rate and from any standpoint have a common  denominator, and, therefore, comprise in a substantial manner  the list of topics in this search for a political solution to  the internal armed conflict.    It is totally wrong to view it as a simple problem of  repatriation of emigrants who wish to return based on their  legitimate right. It is also wrong to assess it for unspeakable  reasons as an administrative or economic problem.    The displaced population in its various forms constitutes a  living and visible testimony of a policy of repression and it  includes separations, traumas, and an aftermath of historic and  national consequences. It is a complex problem to which no  solution can be found if it cannot be found within the framework  of complete agreements that truly resolve the causes of the  problem and that compensate for harm inflicted.    Repression and mechanisms of oppression were the causes that  degenerated into this situation. They are the direct result of  a demented outpouring against insurgents. It would be illusory  or unrealistic to attempt to resolve this acute and immense  problem with partial agreements or measures.    Based on the fact that this reality must be part of the  general solution, the list of topics, and agreements between the  government and the URNG, the following has to be taken into  consideration:    1. The problem of the displaced population has to be  considered and discussed as a whole, starting with the  conditions and reasons that forced the different displacements  and establishing the specific characteristics of its current  situation.    2. Foremost, the solution to this problem must take into  consideration the opinion and stance of the sectors that were  directly hurt by it to study and design their resettlement.    3. Because of its nature, the situation of the displaced  population will be partly resolved if the agreements on human  rights adopted during the process of negotiation are fully  implemented. Their implementation, enforcement, and verification  is a sine qua none condition to make the problem viable. [as  published]    4. The active participation of the international community  through governments, nongovernment organizations, and  humanitarian organizations is truly essential and a decisive  element to guarantee their certain and effective resettlement,  based on the needs of that population.    5. Considering that the essence of the problem of the  displaced population has a social and political nature, although  it also has very important components of an ethnic and economic  nature, it is necessary to draft specific projects that address  those aspects.    6. It is necessary to create and guarantee conditions so  that  the solution to the problem of refugees, people internally  displaced, and resistant communities does not turn into a  demagogic program indented to fracture the overall negotiation.    7. In the case concerning refugees in Mexican territory, the  impartial conditions for their return have to be created. In  addition, the elemental principles of voluntariness and specific  guarantees of a political, economic, and social nature that they  are defending must also be created.

(&sect;644.31)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  Many commenters requested that the Secretary remove transportation, meals, and lodging from the list of unallowable costs in &sect;644.31. The commenters further requested that the Secretary include transportation, meals, and lodging in the list of allowable costs in &sect;644.30. Several commenters argued that campus visits are necessary to help participants choose an appropriate postsecondary placement. Other commenters noted that such visits are often impossible for EOC participants who reside in rural areas. Finally, some commenters argued that transportation, meals, and lodging should be allowable costs because they are allowable under the Talent Search program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary believes that college visits are often necessary to help adult participants gain the confidence and insight that they need to feel comfortable in applying for college admission. The Secretary agrees with the commenters that it would be unfortunate if the cost of such visitations prevented some participants from pursuing postsecondary education. Therefore, on a case-by-case basis, transportation, lodging, and meals may be allowable costs under the circumstances described in the regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary has removed transportation, lodging, and meals from the list of unallowable costs in &sect;644.31. The Secretary has also changed &sect;644.30 so that the list of allowable costs includes: ``(a) Transportation, meals, and, with specific prior approval of the Secretary, lodging for participants and staff for_(1) Visits to postsecondary educational institutions to obtain information relating to the admission of participants to those institutions; (2) Participation in ``College Day'' activities; and (3) Field trips to observe and meet with people who are employed in various career fields in the target area and who can act as role models for participants.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> What other requirements must a grantee meet? (&sect;644.32)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  Some commenters suggested that the Secretary should change &sect;644.32(d)(1) to read: ``Unless a part-time director furthers coordination of the project with other programs for disadvantaged clients operated by the sponsoring institution or agency, or unless a waiver is granted, a grantee shall employ a full-time project director.'' The commenters argued that the change was necessary because the language in the NPRM does not reflect the intent of the 1992 Amendments to the Higher Education Act, which requires the Secretary to encourage coordination among TRIO programs and other programs for disadvantaged students and to allow for a less-than-full-time director.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter recommended that the Secretary require a full-time project director at all Educational Opportunity Centers. The commenter noted that the degree of detail to which a director must be attentive requires a full-time commitment. The commenter further suggested that coordination among projects is desirable and can be accomplished when various directors work together for the mutual benefit of all projects on a single campus.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary strongly supports coordination of EOC activities between and among projects to extent that the coordination fosters_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Improved services for the EOC participants;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) More efficient or effective means of delivering services; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) An increase in the resources available to participants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There is no magic formula for coordination. It only occurs when all partners see it in their best interest to cooperate and coordinate activities to obtain some beneficial objectives. Projects do not have to share staff to coordinate activities. Coordination can occur in a number of ways by staff at all levels. Having a part-time director does not guarantee that coordination of activities will occur. Having a full-time director does not guarantee that the coordination of activities will not occur.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each project is different in terms of its setting, resources, and support systems. The Secretary recognizes that a project may effectively operate with less than a full-time director if other support personnel are in place to assist in shared management duties. However, coordination can take many other forms. For example, coordination may be achieved by planning and conducting joint or cooperative field trips, lectures, career days, or test-preparation sessions. Coordination may also be achieved by sharing space or equipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

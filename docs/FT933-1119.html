			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / TGWU members below 1m MEMBERSHIP of the TGWU general union has dropped below 1m for the first time since the middle of the second world war, it was announced yesterday. The union has 994,881 members, less than half the figure of 14 years ago when membership reached its highest total of 2.1m. Mr Bill Morris, TGWU general secretary, blamed the decline in membership on the contraction of employment since 1979 in private manufacturing, the former stronghold of the union. The largest section of the union is now employed in the public services - 107,655 members - followed by food, drink and tobacco (102,077), and commercial services (97,312). Only 15,192 members are employed in docks, waterways and fishing, and 73,163 in the vehicle building and automotive sector. Nearly a quarter of the TGWU's members are in London and the south-east, with 165,506 in the Midlands and 127,270 in the north-west.</p>

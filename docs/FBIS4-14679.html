			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondents Sergey Zhirnikhin and </F> Ivan Ivanov]    [Text] Budapest April 1 TASS -- Trade-economic cooperation  is a special aspect of the Russian-Hungarian relations, Russian  Prime minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, currently here on an  official visit, told Hungarian businessmen today.    The importance of trade-economic relations has drastically  increased now that Russia and Hungary have overcome the past and  have no serious political problems, said.    Geographic closeness of Russia and Hungary and years-old  traditional bilateral contacts are very important. The two  countries know each other's conditions, customs and potential  market abilities and have a developed communications network for  economic relations. Cooperation reserves are huge, stressed the  premier.    Viktor Chernomyrdin called for encouragement of new forms of  business cooperation, creation of joint ventures and banks,  mutual participation in investment processes and privatization  programs in Hungary and Russia. He thinks that production  cooperation and direct relations of Hungarian and Russian plans  are a priority area. There are also reserves of regional  cooperation.    "We value high Hungarian experience in this sphere. Hungary  has been active in Tatarstan, Bashkortostan, the Komi Republic  and the Stavropol territory," he said.    Speaking of the Russian economic situation, Chernomyrdin  stressed that Russian market economy has been created and will  be further developed.    "We are determined to follow this path no matter how hard it  might be. Russian problems cannot be solved at once. Any haste  can rather spoil the situation, provoke social tension and break  the economic reforms," noted the Russian prime minister.</p>

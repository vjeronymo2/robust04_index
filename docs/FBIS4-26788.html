			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [CHINA DAILY Commentary: "Anti-Drug War"] </F>   [Text] Tomorrow will be the International Day Against Drug  Abuse, an occasion designed to raise people's awareness of the  danger of narcotics.    China, the biggest victim of opium in the 19th century,  knows  best the deadly effect of drugs on a nation as well as a person.    It was not until the establishment of New China in 1949 that  the world's most populous country achieved total elimination of  drug abuse and trafficking as a result of a series of successful  campaigns.    However, international drug rings using China as a transit  route have led the resurgence of drug-related problems in the  country in the past few years. Tons of heroin have been  intercepted and thousands of traffickers of different  nationalities arrested.    In the first quarter of this year alone, China cracked more  than 4,900 narcotics-related cases, seizing 1,000 kilograms of  heroin and 476 kilograms of opium.    The nation's horrendous experience with opium has made it  the  deadliest foe of narcotics, be it heroin, opium or marijuana.  And the government's relentless stance on this score enjoys  wide support of the people at large.    In the face of increasing drug trafficking and abuse, both  central and provincial governments have stepped up the fight  against such illegal activities.    The National Narcotics Control Commission (NNCC), the top  anti-drug agency, has vowed more than once to deal with the  drug-related crimes most sternly.    Established in 1990, NNCC was reorganized recently. Headed  by Tao Siju, Minister of Public Security, the high-powered  commission is composed of 15 senior officials from ministries of  Public Security, Civil Affairs, Justice, Finance, Foreign  Affairs and the Customs as well as the military. The commission  is in charge of stopping drug trafficking, curbing drug abuses  and launching anti-narcotics publicity drives.    Local authorities, especially those in border areas, have  also published drug-control regulations suited to local  conditions to combat the crimes. Various campaigns have been  launched to mobilize the public to join in the fight.    While imposing heavy punishments on narcotics criminals,  including the death sentence, central and local governments have  also carried out rehabilitation plans, which have weaned  thousands of people off drug addiction.    To stop any loopholes, the central government has tightened  control over chemicals that might be used to process drugs by  decreeing that 32 substances cannot be exported without licence.    Drug abuse is becoming more and more an international issue  which cannot be effectively curbed unless all nations join hands.    China has been active all along in the fight against  narcotics. Its successful interceptions of cross-border drug  trafficking have prevented tons of heroin and opium from being  smuggled via China.    To wipe out the scourge of narcotics, however, calls for  comprehensive international co-operation. The nations should  exchange experiences and share information.    With concerted and unremitting efforts we will be sure to  win  this new Opium War.</p>

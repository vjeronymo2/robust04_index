			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Demirel attempts to negotiate the Kurdish labyrinth: An economic and human rights plan, has put reform back on to Turkey's political agenda IT WAS ALWAYS going to be difficult to argue the case for reform after the recent bloodshed in Turkey's Kurdish region. But Turkish Prime Minister Suleyman Demirel's bold pitch in introducing an economic package for the region and submitting human-rights legislation to parliament has taken even his closest supporters by surprise. Incensed perhaps by the criticism from Germany, the European Community and now by the Social Democrats within his own conservative-led coalition, the veteran Turkish politician has seized the initiative to put Kurdish reform back onto the political agenda. The government can breathe more easily on the military front, having thwarted the threat of a general Kurdish insurrection and drawn the sting of the Kurdish Workers Party (PKK), even though the military gains may prove harder to translate into political advantage. The prime minister can also point to some other achievements: two Kurdish-language newspapers have been established and a private Kurdish cultural centre is being started. Even the possibility of a Kurdish political party, another long-held taboo, is now being discussed at the national level. Nevertheless, many of Turkey's 10m Kurds remain disillusioned with Ankara's politicians, the resentment exacerbated by what has been the security forces' increasingly harsh counter-insurgency tactics. The latest violence, with more than 100 people killed following demonstrations to mark the Kurdish new year, has merely played into rebel hands. Mr Demirel may now even find himself charged with caving in to PKK pressure: by seeking social and political answers to the problem he is challenging the hard-line view that only a military solution can bring peace. General Dogan Gures, chief of the general staff, only last week repeated his threat to crush the PKK, whose eight-year campaign for Kurdish independence has claimed more than 3,000 lives. There have been renewed air attacks on alleged rebel targets in north Iraq, underlining the government's claim that the PKK represents an external threat, despite the growing evidence that it is taking root inside Turkey. Mr Demirel seems obliged to endorse his military publicly and has launched an unusually forthright attack on the PKK's Syrian backers. He is planning to send his interior minister, Mr Ismet Sezgin, to Damascus next week to reiterate Turkey's concern at what it sees as Syrian complicity. However, Mr Demirel's real fear is probably closer to home, with the prospect of a racial backlash by ethnic Turks growing every day. Turkish newspapers have become almost ghoulish in their profiles of the young conscript casualties in the Kurdish east, bringing home to many Turks a conflict which had until recently seemed quite remote. In some provincial cities, Turkish businessmen already are refusing to employ ethnic Kurds. Against this background, Mr Demirel's forthcoming submission of his programme to parliament will be a difficult balancing act. This will be made more so by the weak coalition between his True Path party and the Social Democratic Populists (SHP). The coalition has insufficient support to throw out the military's 1982 constitution, which many government officials still maintain is at the root of the Kurdish problem. Moreover, 16 of the 22 radical Kurdish deputies have resigned from the coalition. While few Turks regret the departure of the Kurds' combative and often disputatious parliamentary performance, Mr Demirel has lost a potential channel for negotiations with the guerrillas. All hopes are resting with Mr Demirel's human rights legislation, which was approved last week by the Justice Ministry. The proposals envisage changes in the criminal procedure code, particularly on police conduct during the period of arrest and interrogation. The aim is to reduce detention periods, provide suspects with access to legal counsel and thereby stamp out torture. In an interview last week in the nationalist daily newspaper Hurriyet, Mr Demirel also unveiled spending plans to introduce financial support for free health care in the Kurdish region and for its unemployed. The measures may well seem modest but, taken together with the human rights legislation, they represent the first concrete measures in what is expected to be a major political initiative to address Kurdish problem.</p>

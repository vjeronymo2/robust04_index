			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / International Company News: Venezuelan steelmaker to invest Dollars 300m in exports SIVENSA, Venezuela's largest private steelmaker, is to invest Dollars 300m in a new plant to produce direct-reduced iron ore briquettes for export. Mr Henrique Machado Zuloga, chairman, said his company's exports of iron ore briquettes were aimed at meeting rising international demand for direct-reduced iron ore in steel furnaces, where it is mixed with scrap steel. The briquettes improve the quality of the mixture and help lower pollution levels, he said. Sivensa is already one of the world's largest producers of hot briquetted, direct-reduced iron ore, with installed capacity of over 1m tonnes a year. The company has turned to European and American capital markets to help finance its recent expansion. It was the first Venezuelan company to offer its shares overseas, in the form of American depositary receipts (ADRs) sold in the US. The company recently sold shares on the European market through global depositary shares.</p>

L. 96&hyph;354) requires the Federal government to anticipate and reduce the impact of rules and paperwork requirements on small businesses and other small entities. The primary impact of these final rules is on State, Tribal and Territorial governments. To a lesser extent the regulation could affect individuals and small businesses. However, the number of small businesses affected should be limited, and the expected economic impact on these businesses would not be so significant that a full regulatory flexibility analysis is indicated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;First, the regulations retain many provisions designed to ensure broad participation by small businesses in the program. For example, the IV&hyph;A entitlement programs provide that individuals must be able to choose among available providers, including family day care providers. The At-Risk program regulations still require that any registration requirements States impose on unlicensed and unregulated providers be simple and timely, and facilitate prompt payment. In the CCDBG program, the regulations still require that parents have a choice among a variety of providers including family day care providers. These and other provisions in the current rules will help ensure that States exercise restraint in imposing any additional requirements on small entities providing child care.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The proposed rule contains a number of provisions which could result in some decreases in the regulatory and economic burdens on providers who are small businesses. Most importantly, because States will be able to operate their programs under a more consistent set of program rules, participating providers should face a simpler and more streamlined set of regulatory requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Many of the providers who would potentially be affected are in-home providers. These providers are generally not operating as small businesses, but as domestic employees; thus, any impact on them need not be specifically addressed under this Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The regulation could ultimately result in some additional regulatory requirements or health and safety standards for other providers, such as family day care providers, who are small businesses. However, the impacts on small businesses, if any, would not be directly attributable to this regulation. With the possible exception of the immunization provision, the regulation does not directly propose any expansion of regulatory requirements or health and safety standards on providers; thus, any impacts on providers should only arise as the result of independent State and/or local decisions to impose additional requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The effects tests may have discouraged States from imposing additional requirements_beyond those which were generally applicable_on providers who specifically wanted to participate in these federally supported child care programs. However, we do not believe States have much interest in imposing additional requirements on these providers. First, States and localities know that parents often have difficulty locating child care providers which meet their needs, and that low-income parents frequently have more serious access problems. They do not want to make it appreciably more difficult for providers to participate in the programs which serve low-income families. Secondly, States have limited resources for enforcing and monitoring child care regulations; thus, they are motivated to be selective about imposing requirements. Thirdly, States have an interest in establishing a consistent set of requirements for providers, regardless of their payment sources; differential rules make it more difficult to ensure regulatory compliance and provide a seamless system of services which help families make the transition from welfare to self-sufficiency. Finally, under current rules, State and local governments have full flexibility to set general regulatory requirements and health and safety standards for child care providers. If States (or other grantees) have felt that there was a substantial need for additional requirements (presumably to protect the well-being of children in care), we would have expected them to act under this general authority.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While States generally have immunization requirements for children in child care, the proposed immunization provision might result in some additional children being subject to immunization requirements or stronger requirements for some children. However, States have flexibility in deciding how immunization requirements are to be implemented. Requirements would not necessarily be imposed on providers; rather, States can choose to impose them on eligible families. Thus, the immunization provision in this proposed rule does not directly affect small businesses. Further, where States do choose to impose additional requirements on providers related to the immunization provision, such requirements would be basically administrative in nature (e.g., documentation); we expect the costs of immunization to be covered through other funding sources. Thus, this provision would not have a significant economic impact on affected providers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, the number of entities affected, and the net economic impact on them, should not be significant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Paperwork Reduction Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Certain sections of these proposed regulations contain information collection requirements which are subject to review and approval by OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. chapter 35). The proposed revisions for the title IV&hyph;A child care programs will produce only minor changes and additions to the State Supportive Services Plan (ACF&hyph;106).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

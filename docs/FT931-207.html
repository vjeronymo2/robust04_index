			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Inquiry launched into party funds A SWEEPING Commons' inquiry into the funding of political parties was launched yesterday. It is set to investigate the Conservative party's links with businesses and Labour's with trade unions. The cross-party Home Affairs committee has called for evidence from the treasurers of every party represented in the House of Commons. The investigation will examine the case for and against the state funding of political parties, as well as the methods by which parties are financed at present. The MPs will also look at whether there should be greater legal control over political parties' sources of finance. Both Labour and the Liberal Democrat parties fought the last election on manifestos calling for greater state aid for political parties. Among Labour MPs the question of state funding of political parties has become an issue because of the leadership's determination to weaken its links with the trade unions - a move likely to lead to a fall in union donations. The Conservative party hierarchy has resisted pressure for a greater disclosure of details of its donors but if officials from the party are required to give evidence they could be pressed to reveal more information about sources of finance. Some Tory activists want greater openness. The government already gives limited financial support to the work of opposition political parties at Westminster, but the last review was after the 1987 election and the money is related to parliamentary activities rather than general campaigning. Some MPs on the committee are concerned that political parties should have sufficient funds to perform their duties. The committee could decide to study the extent to which other European countries provide financial support to political parties. The Home Affairs committee, chaired by Sir Ivan Lawrence, Conservative MP for Burton, will also take evidence from the Confederation of British Industry, the Trades Union Congress and other interested groups, as well as the Green Party.</p>

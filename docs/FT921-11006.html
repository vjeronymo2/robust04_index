			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / Observer: Priceless Had trouble getting hold of the FT recently? Then look no further than Harvey Nichols, the Knightsbridge department store. Its display windows are crammed with sculpted piles of FTs. There is even a huge head with its tongue stuck out, all made out of the pink 'un. The up-market store, which prides itself on the originality of its displays, used 100,000 copies. The bad news for Observer and colleagues is that the papers were not bought, but given away . . . and that was before the price went up another 5p.</p>

			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / PM warns Serbia on eve of peace talks THE WARLORDS and political masters of the rival forces in the former Yugoslavia prepared for a new round of peace talks in Geneva today as international opinion hardened against Serbia. Mr John Major, the prime minister, speaking in London, warned the Serbs that the west was running out of patience with the lack of progress towards a settlement. There was sporadic small arms fire around the Bosnian capital Sarajevo yesterday and there are indications that Bosnian Moslem forces are preparing counter-attacks to dislodge Serb forces from their more exposed positions in the hills south of the city. Under pressure from Moslem forces, the Bosnian Serbs were again reported to have defied UN no-fly rules to re-supply troops. This was implicitly admitted by Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, who said he had issued orders to ground all fixed-wing aircraft but wanted to continue using helicopters to ferry wounded from battle areas. General Philippe Morillon, commander of the UN protection Forces (Unprofor) in Bosnia, told a French radio station yesterday that he feared fighting could flare up in Sarajevo in an attempt to undermine the Geneva talks. He again called for a winter truce around the capital, which has been besieged for months by Serb forces. Speaking on BBC radio, Mr Major said sanctions might have to be both tightened and stepped up dramatically, and that the 'complete and total diplomatic isolation of Serbia' might also have to be considered. 'Serbia should understand very plainly the increasing impatience and despair felt in the west at the way they have been behaving,' he said. 'Everyone to a certain extent is to blame for the present conflict but the primary blame beyond a doubt in our mind, lies with the Serbs. 'They are the principal cause of the present conflict and people are getting very impatient with that, not just us - the European Community collectively, the US and others as well. I do not believe they should push that impatience too far,' he warned. Faction leaders gather, Page 2</p>

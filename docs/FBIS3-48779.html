The seasonally adjusted production index for the mining and  manufacturing sectors came to 88.0 against the base 100 for  1990, the ministry said in a preliminary report.    The index was the second-lowest under the 1990 base,  introduced in May last year, after 87.6 registered last October.    Shipments in December decreased 0.3 percent for an index  figure of 89.7, also a shift from a 1.0 percent growth in  November.    The inventory index declined 0.8 percent to 108.4, following  a 0.8 percent rise in November.    The December inventory-to-sales ratio rose 1.3 percent  against a 0.5 percent slide in November, with the index standing  at 125.6.    Industrial output has been seeing ups and downs alternately  in the past five months -- a 1.2 percent fall in August, a 2.2  percent gain in September and a 5.5 percent slide in October,  the largest- ever decline.    On an unadjusted basis, industrial production in December  slid 4.2 percent from a year before for the 27th successive  month of decline, the longest ever losing streak.</p>

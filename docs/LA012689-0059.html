			<p><P> January 26, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Four government censors in Rome have been ordered to stand trial on obscenity  charges for clearing the way for the TV showing of "9 1/2 Weeks," the steamy  movie starring Mickey Rourke and Kim Basinger. The censors reduced the 18-year  age limit for viewing the film in movie houses to 14, thus making it eligible  to be shown on TV. The commercial Canale 5 network showed the film in prime  time Dec. 16, 1987. The court stepped in after receiving complaints about the  TV showing. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

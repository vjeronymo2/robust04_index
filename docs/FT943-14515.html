			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / Survey of Merseyside (7): Reskilling emphasised in 'Training for work' - A look at changing the economic base Wavertree Technology Park was launched in 1983 as a symbol of Merseyside's future. The idea was to attract value-added, high-wage new employment - rather than low-paid jobs in retailing and assembly - and help stop the drift of qualified, able young people from the region in search of work. The original 65-acre site was a disused railway marshalling yard. Tenancies were to be restricted, if possible, to high technology and associated industries. The original park is now approaching full occupancy, with 30 companies employing 2,200 people. The technology park has always worked closely with the Merseyside Innovation Centre, which, in turn, has close links with the two universities, Liverpool and John Moores, and the Merseyside TEC. MIC was set up in 1981 by the universities and the local authorities, and has become an important force in providing product development, design contracts and training. One of its largest contracts is with Merseyside Training and Enterprise Council and is aimed at keeping university graduates in Merseyside. Each year, the MIC has a graduate training and placement programme involving more than 200 unemployed graduates. About 70 per cent get jobs, The MIC is also involved in registering companies for the BS5750 quality standard and helps inventors and small companies obtain seedcorn money from such schemes as the Prince's Trust and the DTI's Enterprise Initiative. Dr Brian Job, executive director, says: 'We give signposting support to individuals and inventors. We have around 1,000 approaches from individuals or companies a year.' An adjacent 23-acre site to Wavertree has been acquired and landscaped and the first building, a business and technology centre, has just been completed by English Partnerships, the successor to English Estates. Merseyside Innovation Centre will manage this new centre and strengthen the links between the park and the universities to encourage more technology transfer. However, Wavertree's role as the forerunner of a local network of similar parks for knowledge-based concerns remains, in the words of Mr John Pugh, corporate affairs director, 'an aspiration'. So difficult has been Merseyside's unemployment problem that the area has been glad of any job-creating investment it can get. The largest employer on Wavertree is Barclaycard - certainly not low tech, but hardly the model of state-of-the-art high technology. However, the desire not to be content with a mix of low paid jobs in retailing, tourism, leisure and construction remains strong. The evidence for this is a drive to upgrade skills in all areas, rather than just trying to reduce unemployment. Mrs Linda Bloomfield, chief executive of Merseyside Training and Enterprise Council, feels some criticism of the two main training programmes has been justified. Many believe the youth training scheme and the employment training programme have been aimed at reducing dole queues, rather than addressing the long-term problems of skill mismatches between the jobless and the jobs available. She says: 'The employment training programme has been particularly discredited. People were signing up for a few weeks, then immediately going back to unemployment.' The replacement programme - 'Training for Work' - emphasises reskilling and tries to ensure proper placement for older long-term unemployed people. Meanwhile, the programme of training credits for young people which has taken over from the youth scheme stresses training and acquiring skills for both the employed and unemployed. Mrs Bloomfield says: 'We start in the schools with 14-year-olds. We try to raise their horizons, make them believe in themselves.' School-leavers are given credits which will give them training that leads to a national vocational qualification. The training credits programme is the largest scheme undertaken by Merseyside TEC, accounting for Pounds 20m of its Pounds 46m budget. At any given time, there are 6,000 young people on schemes. Last year, 36 per cent left with some form of National Vocational Qualification, with a 42 per cent increase in the numbers reaching NVQ level three. Over 25 per cent went into a permanent job. Mrs Bloomfield believes that solving Merseyside's chronic unemployment problem is beyond the remit of the three Tecs - the other two are Qualitec in St Helens and Cewtec, which covers Chester, Ellesmere Port and Wirral. 'Overall unemployment is 15 per cent against a national level of 10 per cent, but male unemployment in some pockets is 50 per cent. Merseyside will go on exporting workers,' she says. 'What we can do is contribute to making skills available so that the significant money about to come to Merseyside utilises (the skills of) the local population.'</p>

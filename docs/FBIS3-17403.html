Mr Nazarbayev has no  need for pockets: when he wants to smoke, an aide scurries  forward with a cigarette and a lighter; when it rains, another  produces an umbrella; and if he sneezes, a third is ready to  produce a handkerchief. The president, with a complete lack of  selfconsciousness, has a tendency to begin sentences with the  phrase "I always tell my Kazakhs..."    The strong hand with which Mr Nazarbayev rules Kazakhstan --  a country the size of western Europe stretched between Russia  and China disturbs many western political observers. He sees  politically authoritarian and economically free-market  south-east Asia, rather than western Europe, as a model for  development. Western investors, weary of the anarchy in Russia's  economic and political life, do not object. They are delighted  to have found a despot with whom they can do business.  Kazakhstan has already finalised an oil and a gas deal with two  consortia of western multinationals. Russia, which has far  greater oil and gas production, has been much less successful in  attracting western investment.    This contrast gives Mr Nazarbayev the opportunity to observe  that "whereas Kazakhstan is a unitary state, in Russia all  political power has collapsed, so perhaps it is harder to do  business there".    He believes that "based on our oil and gas reserves, we can  say that in the 21st century Kazakhstan will be the world's main  hydrocarbon producer". The businessmen patiently awaiting an  audience in the plush lobby of the Hyde Park Hotel during his  visit to London this week might not go so far, but they tend to  agree that Kazakhstan is a good commercial prospect.    While Mr Nazarbayev dreams of his country becoming a central  Asian Saudi Arabia -- with a South Korea style government -- he  knows Kazakhstan must first overcome formidable hurdles. Chief  among them, as for all the former Soviet republics, is the  development of a workable relationship with Russia.    Kazakhstan is bound to its northern neighbour by ties of  blood and miles of pipeline. The blood runs in the veins of the  ethnic Russians, who make up more than 35 per cent of  Kazakhstan's population. Aware of the potential threat from  this Russian population, Mr Nazarbayev is careful on questions  of language and culture: both Russian and Kazakh are the  official languages of the republic and both Russian and Kazakh  holidays are officially celebrated.    Despite this sensitivity, unrest among the Russians in  Kazakhstan is growing, and is finding encouragement from some  quarters in Russia. Russian nationalists -- ranging from Mr  Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the neo-fascist leader born in Almaty, the  Kazakh capital, to Alexander Solzhenitsyn, the Russian author --  believe the north-eastern corner of Kazakhstan, where Russians  form a majority, should be incorporated into the motherland.  Some local Russians agree. Mr Zhirinovsky's land claims so  riled the normally diplomatic Mr Nazarbayev that he described  him as "a little Hitler".    Economic bonds with Russia pose a more immediate problem for  Mr Nazarbayev. Soviet centralisation means Kazakhstan has no  oil refineries, and all its pipelines lead into Russia rather  than to the western markets Mr Nazarbayev is wooing. Over the  winter, this infrastructure created the paradox of oil-rich  Kazakhstan shivering in an energy crisis.    As a member of Mr Nazarbayev's delegation bitterly put it:  "We walked over billions of barrels of oil and gas, but we  nearly froze to death."    The shortage was created by the failure of Siberian  refineries to stick to an agreement to return refined oil to  Kazakhstan. Through control of the pipelines, Russia is also  demanding an equity share in the two big ventures Kazakhstan is  undertaking to exploit its oil and gas fields.    "There are certainly some political overtones here," said Mr  Nazarbayev . "These are our growing pains. We are all just  beginning to learn to treat one another as fully independent  states."    These overtones, and Kazakhstan's realisation that Russia  has  the economic muscle to drive a hard bargain, have provoked an  important shift in Mr Nazarbayev's relationship with the Kremlin.    In contrast with the leaders of more stridently independent  nations, such as Ukraine or the Baltic states, Mr Nazarbayev  wanted to preserve the connections between the former Soviet  republics when the Union disintegrated in 1991. But his dream  of a partnership between equals has been displaced by the  reality of Russia's increasingly overt efforts to dominate its  neighbours; so the Kazakh leader has begun taking a different  tack.    The best example is the rouble zone. Last year, Mr  Nazarbayev fiercely objected to being forced to drop the rouble  by Moscow reformers, who argued the impoverished central Asian  republics were dragging Russia into hyperinflation. Having been  forced into the cold and survived, Mr Nazarbayev is now scornful  of proposals by Moscow's new leadership to recreate the rouble  zone.    "Having a common currency now that each republic has its own  economy, its own budget, its own central bank and its own  legislature is just wishful thinking," Mr Nazarbayev said.  "What is happening now is that each state is finding its own  niche."    For Kazakhstan, this entails breaking its dependence on  Russia's oil and gas infrastructure. Mr Nazarbayev said he  would reject the Russian bid for equity in Kazakhstan's oil and  gas fields. But so long as Russia controls the pipelines and  the refineries, his words may prove empty.    That is why he spoke publicly this week about a hitherto  secret project -- Kazakhstan's plan to build a pipeline from  Karachaganak, its largest gas field in the north, direct to the  west via Turkey. "The pipeline through Turkey is a long-term  project but it is definitely one to which we will give the  highest priority," Mr Nazarbayev said.    The dilemma he and his Kazakhs face is that, bright though  their prospects may be, today they must rely on Russia. It will  be years before Kazakhstan reaps the benefits of developing its  oilfields and building pipelines direct to the west. In the  meantime, Mr Nazarbayev, the unchallenged ruler of his own land,  will have to bend in his dealings with Russia.</p>

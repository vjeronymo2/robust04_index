It is 49 years since a Soviet soldier wrote on the wall of  the Reichstag building in Berlin and the renowned Marshal Zhukov  put his signature to the document on the full and unconditional  surrender by Nazi Germany. No matter how much time passes, no  matter how many epochs replace one another, the date 9 May 1945  will remain forever in the memory and hearts of our people.  Eternal glory to the heroes of the Great Patriotic War!    Looking back on what happened almost half a century ago, one  finds oneself wondering whether there is another people in the  world capable of such self-sacrifice and deserving of such  undying glory and respect. We bow low to you for your loyalty  to the oath, for your heroism, for you love of your motherland,  and for your anguish at its destiny. The Russian Army is proud  of your exploits and of your victory.

Russia's armed forces are the heirs of the Soviet armed  forces, of its best traditions and victories. In the name of  the soldiers of the Russian Army, of the leadership of the  Defense Ministry, let me congratulate you personally with all my  heart on Victory Day. Russian soldiers wish those who fought in  that war, all who made their contribution to the great victory,  good spirits, optimism, as many unclouded, happy days as  possible, and, of course, good health. The years are relentless,  but you still have a lot to give, dear veterans.

Honor and glory to you!  Endless thanks for your selflessness, your soldier's duty and  patience, your loyalty to the ideals of patriotism and love of  your fatherland! Thank you.</p>

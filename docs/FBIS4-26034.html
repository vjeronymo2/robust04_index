			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 16 (XINHUA) -- China values its  friendly ties with Denmark and hopes for effective cooperation  in environmental protection and other fields.    Li Ruihuan, chairman of the National Committee of the  Chinese  People's Political Consultative Conference, expressed this at a  meeting with visiting denmark Minister of Environment Svend  Auken and his party here today.    China is launching a large-scale economic construction and  environmental problems are becoming more conspicuous each  passing day, Li said.    The country needs, and has put great emphasis on, learning  from and absorbing advanced foreign expertise in environmental  protection, he said.    In so doing, he said, "we hope to preserve a good  environment, achieve economic growth and bring benefits to  future generations."    Denmark boasts many advantages in environmental protection,  he said, voicing the hope that the environmental departments of  the two countries increase contacts, strengthen exchanges and  explore new spheres of friendly cooperation.    During the meeting, Li recalled his recent visit to Denmark.  He asked Auken to convey his thanks and best regards to the  Danish prime minister, president of the parliament and other  leaders.    Though far away from each other, China and Denmark have had  friendly ties for a long time. Denmark was one of the first  Western countries to set up diplomatic ties with New China and  also supported the resumption of China's seat in the United  Nations, Li noted.    Auken said China's economy is growing fast and Denmark is  keen on extensive cooperation with China in the sector of  environmental protection.    Auken and his party are here as guests of the State Bureau  for Environmental Protection. Xie Zhenhua, the bureau's  director, was present at the meeting.</p>

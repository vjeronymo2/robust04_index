			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In connection with the proposal of the Social  Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR] to conduct a dialogue with the  opposition parties, the Executive Bureau of the Democratic Party  [PD(FSN)] reiterates its readiness to participate in a dialogue  -- a communique received from the PD(FSN) reads. In the first  stage of the discussions, the PD(FSN) will be represented at the  talks by the Internal Political Relations Department.    Another communique of the same political grouping refers to  the statements made on 5 February by Mr. Mircea Snegur,  president of the Republic of Moldova, and Mr. Dimitru Motpan,  leader of the Agrarian Democratic Party [PDAM] of the Republic  of Moldova. The PD(FSN) Executive Bureau considers that they  are uncultured allegations with an electoral tinge, running  counter to the historic truth and to the interests of the  Romanians living between the Prut and Dniester Rivers.  Regarding the proposal that the parties advocating the  unification with Romania should be excluded from the political  life, the PD(FSN) considers it as an antidemocratic gesture, at  variance with the course toward democracy and pluralism assumed  by the Chisinau authorities before their own people and the  European democratic institutions. The PD(FSN), the communique  points out, is deeply involved and committed to achieving closer  ties between Romania and the Republic of Moldova.</p>

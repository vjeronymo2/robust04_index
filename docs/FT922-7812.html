			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Pemex ordered to plan reorganisation PRESIDENT Carlos Salinas de Gortari has given Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex), Mexico's state oil company, 30 days to present plans for a fundamental restructuring of its operations. The order comes less than a month after the explosion at Guadalajara that killed 200 people. The company has been widely blamed for the disaster and, during the past couple of weeks, has been subject to sustained and bitter criticism. Few details of the plans are known, but they are likely to lead to a greater decentralisation of Pemex's operations, and further demarcation between its lines of businesses. Local managers may assume greater responsibility for operations. It is expected more services will be contracted out to private companies. Pemex, and Mexico's oil reserves, will remain under full state ownership, and foreign oil companies will still not be allowed to explore for oil in Mexico, nor build and operate refineries. Under advice from McKinsey, the US consultancy, Pemex has already been divided into five profit and cost centres - exploration and production, petrochemicals, refining, sales, and construction. It is intended that the accounting price of trade between the centres be based on a formula linked to international prices. However, this new structure is meeting resistance within Pemex, and is not thought to be as running as smoothly as the government would like.</p>

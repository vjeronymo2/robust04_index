			<p><P> March 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOOD PHARMACY: A FALSE BELIEF IN A DIET SLOWDOWN  </P> <P> Do you believe that the more you diet, the harder it is to lose weight because  your body adapts and turns down your rate of burning calories -- your  metabolism?  </P> <P> This belief is extremely popular, but wrong, according to new U.S. Department  of Agriculture research by Dr. William Rumpler, who used a specially built,  room-size live-in calorimeter to assess calories burned.  </P> <P> Researchers measured calories burned during 24-hour periods before and after 28  men went on a calorie-reduced diet. Considering lower caloric intake, the men  did not burn fewer calories than they did prior to the diet. "Their metabolism  rate did not decrease," says Dr. Paul Moe, head of the USDA lab.  </P> <P> This is good news for dieters because "they can now be confident that if they  stay on a reduced-calorie diet, they will lose weight," insists Moe.  </P> <P> He says a main reason dieters have so much trouble continuing to lose weight is  because they don't take in fewer calories for their reduced body size. "If you  were once 130 pounds and you get down to 110," he explains, "you must eat like  a person who weighs 110, not someone who still weighs 130."  </P> <P> If you fear developing pancreatic cancer, eat more beans, lentils, peas  (legumes) and dried fruits. Ditto for prostate cancer.  </P> <P> To ward off colon cancer? Eat more beta-carotene foods, such as carrots,  spinach and other green leafy vegetables and cut back on meat. To inhibit lung  and stomach cancer, eat more fruit.  </P> <P> Those are the implications from the latest findings of a long-term study of  34,000 Seventh Day Adventists. Those eating the most of such foods were least  likely to develop such cancers.  </P> <P> What about heart disease? Surprisingly, after accounting for such factors as  smoking, obesity and high blood pressure, "one food stood out, as protective  against heart attacks -- nuts," says Dr. Gary Fraser, director of the study and  a professor at Loma Linda University School of Medicine.  </P> <P> People who ate nuts four times a week had about half the chances of a fatal or  non-fatal heart attack as those who ate nuts less than once a week.  </P> <P> What kind of nuts? That's what Fraser wants to know too. He's planning tests to  feed men various nuts and then check their blood pressure, blood fats and  blood-clotting factors.  </P> <P> Is fiber the reason high-fiber foods seem to discourage various diseases,  including cancer, heart disease and diabetes? Maybe not. Or maybe fiber is only  part of the reason.  </P> <P> That's what Dr. Lilian Thompson, University of Toronto, among others, is  discovering. In trying to sort out what makes high-fiber, high complex  carbohydrate foods healthful, she found that a compound previously thought  harmful may in fact be beneficial. It's phytate, also called phytic acid. It is  highly concentrated in high-fiber foods, notably dried beans and lentils.  </P> <P> Such legumes are well-established reducers of blood cholesterol and blood  sugar. But when Thompson removed phytate from navy bean flour, it no longer  stopped sharp surges of blood sugar in human volunteers. Only beans with  phytate did that, regardless of their fiber content. That makes Thompson  speculate that so-called "anti-nutrients" like phytate "are mostly responsible  for the benefits of high-fiber foods."  </P> <P> Phytates may also be one reason legume-lovers have less cancer of certain  types. University of Maryland researchers found that cancer-exposed rats given  phytate in their drinking water had 35% fewer cancers than rats not given  phytate.  </P></p>

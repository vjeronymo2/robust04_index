			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / GMB union sues cargo company A CARGO company is being sued by the GMB general union over the death of two dockers in separate accidents at King George Dock in Hull. Northern Cargo Services was prosecuted in both cases by the Health and Safety Executive. In the first it was fined Pounds 1,500 plus Pounds 1,000 costs, and in the second Pounds 3,000 plus Pounds 2,027 costs. Neither of the victims' widows has received compensation. Mr George Hewson, GMB regional industrial officer in Hull, blamed 'the lack of health and safety provision' at the company for the deaths. Accidents in Britain's ports have increased since the deregulation of dock labour five years ago.</p>

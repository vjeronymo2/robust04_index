			<p><P> June 25, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> THE USE OF NUNCHAKUS  </P> <P> The Eighth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States reads:  </P> <P> "Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel  and unusual punishments inflicted."  </P> <P> The use of nunchakus on peaceful Operation Rescue protesters by the San Diego  Police Department is clearly cruel and unusual. Their use has resulted in  broken bones, sprains and other physical anguish.  </P> <P> The San Diego police chief, city manager and members of the Citizens Advisory  Board on Police-Community Relations believe that such measures are not cruel  ("Advisory Board Supports Police Use of Nunchakus on Protesters," June 15). For  a fair evaluation, they should subject themselves to such handling.  </P> <P> When and where else in this state have such measures been used on peaceful  protesters? Certainly not on animal protection protesters or on anti-Operation  Rescue protesters.  </P> <P> Andrea Skorepa, acting chairwoman of the advisory board, is setting up herself  and the police as judge and jury when she says, "If . . . you're willing to  violate the law and be arrested, then you must be willing to accept the  consequences."  </P> <P> Determination of guilt and punishment, or consequences, if you will, are  functions of courts of law, not arresting officers. The San Diego police chief  was right when he said the Operation Rescue people "made the men and women of  the San Diego Police Department look bad." However, it was the brutal actions  of the police themselves that made them look bad.  </P> <P> We should be concerned that our law enforcement officers are allowed to use  such means. The Eighth Amendment protects all citizens at all times, and, even  when a person is convicted of a crime, the punishment must be fair, humane and  uniform.  </P> <P> JOHN K. FARNSWORTH  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

The  Belgian ambassador in Damascus attended the meeting. At the  outset of the session, Mr. Urbain extended sympathies on behalf  of himself and the Belgian Government to the bereaved President  Hafiz al-Asad and his dignified family and the Syrian people and  government. He thanked the Syrian Government for letting his  visit go ahead, despite the mourning the country is observing  over the death of the president's son, the golden knight, Staff  Major Basil al-Asad. Dr. Salim Yasin thanked him for his  sympathies.    The two sides then discussed bilateral trade and relations  between Syria and the EC in general, and explored avenues to  diversify and strengthen these ties. They agreed on a number of  measures to boost cooperation between Syria and Belgium and the  EC nations.</p>

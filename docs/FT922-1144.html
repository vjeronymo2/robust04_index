			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Labour party set for victory in Israeli elections: Clear win for Rabin would provide shot in arm for sluggish peace process ISRAEL'S Labour party was set for a stunning general election victory over the hardline Likud early today, paving the way for Mr Yitzhak Rabin to take over as prime minister and implement his promise to accelerate Middle East peace negotiations. With 25 per cent of the votes counted, Israeli television projected that Labour would emerge as the biggest single party by a wide margin, winning 45 of the 120 seats in the Knesset, or parliament. Likud, led by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, was set to win 32 seats. The projections, broadly in line with an earlier TV exit poll, signalled the biggest swing in Israeli politics since Likud came to power in 1977 proclaiming its rightwing ideology. The outcome represented a personal triumph for Mr Rabin, prime minister in the mid-1970s, and a disaster for Mr Shamir. Labour supporters took to the streets, cheering and dancing in celebration. The main question remaining was which parties Mr Rabin would turn to in an attempt to form a majority coalition government. Early projections suggested he would have the option of joining forces with Meretz, an alliance of leftwing and pro-peace parties, with backing outside the government from two small Arab parties. Meretz was forecast to win 12 seats and the Arab parties five. But Mr Rabin signalled that he would prefer a broader-based government, possibly even including Likud. He said: 'We'll aspire to a coalition which will express the mainstream of the people . . . we will want to include all the forces which identify with our way - the advancement of peace while maintaining security.' Mr Shamir, 76, is now likely to come under strong pressure to step down as party leader. But he was defiant, saying: 'Tonight, all over the world and in the Middle East, people are rejoicing (that the Likud has fallen). I say to them your happiness is premature, the Likud is not going down. It is alive and well and will continue its just struggle.' A victory of the scale forecast would be a resounding endorsement of Mr Rabin, who took over as Labour leader from Mr Shimon Peres earlier this year. The main consequence of a clear Labour victory may be a boost for the peace process. Mr Shamir had refused to yield any of the occupied territories in return for peace and appeared lukewarm on conceding the initial stage of Palestinian autonomy. Mr Rabin and Labour are committed to giving up at least some of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. They are willing to move quickly to an autonomy agreement. The forecast of a Labour victory was welcomed by Jordan and the Palestine Liberation Organisation. Tide of discontent Page 4</p>

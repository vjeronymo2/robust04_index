			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Management: Pioneers and Prophets - Mary Parker Follett Even in academic circles the name of this Bostonian polymath (1868-1933) occasionally provokes the question 'Mary who?'. Follett's posthumous fame, however, is growing and a new book due to be published in January* seems certain to bring her work to a wider audience. Peppered between extracts of her writings on conflict, power, leadership and other issues moreover, are glowing testimonials from distinguished authorities such as Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Peter Drucker, and Henry Mintzberg. 'Follett's espousal of mutual problem solving foreshadows employee involvement, participative management, quality circles and other team-based approaches to involving the workforce in diagnosis, analysis and solution finding,' says Moss Kanter. Drucker enthuses: 'Every one of her comments is fresh, pertinent and insightful, but her true importance lies in her vision. She saw the society of organisations and she saw management as its generic function and specific organ well before either really existed. . .She was the prophet of management.' A political scientist who never worked in business, Follett applied her original ideas in the field of social work. She was profoundly interested in the individual in groups and in society, developing a brand of democractic governance based on participation and responsibility. The seeds of late 20th century empowerment, cross functional thinking and leadership styles are firmly planted in her writings. On conflict she argued that differences of opinion and different interests should not be pushed under the carpet; problems ought to be resolved jointly through searching for an 'integrated' solution while imposed settlements, however benevolent, were ultimately doomed to failure. Follett was eagerly listened to by senior managers in the 1920s, She developed her ideas in a series of lectures in New York in 1925 and just before her death at the inauguration of the London School of Economics' Department of Business Administration. Her advocacy of conflict as a constructive and creative means of problem solving and her criticisms of hierarchical structures were out of tune with thinking after the second world war, and her ideas fell into neglect in the west. Drucker rejects sexism as an explanation, Moss Kanter is not so sure. The Japanese, however, were not so blinkered and incorporated much of Follett's teaching into their management culture in the late 1950s. Much of the credit for unearthing the Follett story deserves to go to Pauline Graham, editor of the forthcoming book. Graham, now a freelance lecturer and consultant in North London, discovered her 'mentor' in the mid 1960s. * Mary Parker Follett - Prophet of Management. Harvard Business School Press.

			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Hint at continued donation secrecy SIR NORMAN FOWLER, the Tory chairman, yesterday gave a strong hint that the party would resist pressure for the identities of its major financial donors to be made public. At the end of the debate on party organisation, Sir Norman rejected any notion of state funding for political parties, saying he would defend the principle that people should be free to give money to political groups if they wished. 'As with charities, if people wish to give money without publicity, their privacy will be respected,' he said. In recent months, the Labour party has campaigned strongly for the identity of donors to party funds to be made public. Several speakers in the debate on party organisation also said they were concerned that the party leadership was not giving financial support in retaining party agents in the constituencies. However, Sir Norman said there had been a drastic reduction in spending, which had been halved from more than Pounds 12m to Pounds 6m a year. 'We are spending less now in real terms than at any time since 1979,' he said.</p>

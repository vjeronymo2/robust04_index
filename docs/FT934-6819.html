			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / KLM falls on rights issue talk Shares in KLM Royal Dutch Airlines fell heavily yesterday in response to prospects for a rights issue following the collapse of the Alcazar merger talks. KLM, whose talks with Swissair, Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) and Austrian Airlines ended on Sunday, said it had no plans to pursue another European partnership. It also said it would be looking at a share issue, in which it could count on the participation of the Dutch government, which owns 38.2 per cent. Mr Pieter Bouw, chairman, said: 'When the time is ripe, we will go to the market.' The talks broke down after KLM insisted the new European carrier should co-operate with the Dutch carrier's US partner, Northwest Airlines. The other three preferred Swissair's US partner, Delta Airlines. KLM's shares fell by 8 per cent yesterday to close at Fl 37.20. Dutch unions have suggested KLM could seek to raise Fl 1bn (Pounds 358m). Analysts believe the issue would be closer to Fl 500m. KLM's current market value is just over Fl 1.9bn. SAS said yesterday it was likely to deepen co-operation with Swissair and Austrian Airlines. The airline, which incurred a nine-month loss of SKr11.3bn (Pounds 941m), said it would cut costs by up to SKr2.5bn, including shutting 12 routes and selling 17 aircraft, to get back to profit in 1995. One way forward would be to extend the European Quality Alliance established four years ago with Swissair and Austrian Airlines which covers co-operation on services to eastern Europe, Africa and South America. SAS must also seek a chief executive. Mr Jan Carlzon, chief executive for 12 years, stepped aside in September and will not return to SAS now that Alcazar, behind which he was a driving force, has failed. His successor, Mr Jan Reinas, was named only as a stop-gap until Alcazar was completed. He will become president of Norsk Skog, the Norwegian forestry group, in April. Moody's has put SAS under review for possible downgrade, affecting Dollars 1.2bn of long-term debt currently rated A2. World stock markets, Page 48</p>

			<p><P> October 25, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOB'S BIG BOY  </P> <P> In response to "Big Boy Bowing Out: Original Glendale Diner Serves Its Last  Burger After 51 Years," Metro, Oct. 17:  </P> <P> During the 1950s Bob's was a large drive-in restaurant popular with young  people as a hang-out "American Graffiti" style.  </P> <P> About 1958, a novelty song was frequently played on the radio about a Nash  Rambler behind a Cadillac; much horn honking was integrated into the music. The  young people, one night, all listening to the same station on their car radios,  proceeded to honk their horns in collective unison.  </P> <P> The carhops were quite perplexed, not knowing how all the young people knew to  honk in unison. I thought to myself -- "only in America!"  </P> <P> We will miss Bob's.  </P> <P> DON MANNING  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

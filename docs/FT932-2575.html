			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Attempt to put Nigeria polls back on course NIGERIA'S National Electoral Commission yesterday announced it would appeal against this week's court ruling restraining it from publishing election results. It said it was taking the case to the appeal court in an effort to put the country's presidential elections back on course. A high court ban on the outcome of Saturday's presidential elections threatened to undermine the democratic process which is due to restore civilian rule on August 27 and cast fresh doubts on the readiness of President Ibrahim Babangida to hand over power. Mr Ahmed Kusamotu, the chairman of the electoral commission, said yesterday that the suspension of the result was not in the best interests of democracy in the country. 'The NEC is being manipulated by the authorities,' said Mr Amos Idakula, a spokesman for the Social Democratic Party, which had a commanding lead in the polls after half the 30 states' results had been announced earlier this week. The Campaign for Democracy echoed the sense of injustice felt by many Nigerians at the legal wrangle which has disrupted the presidential polls. 'What upsets us about this court order is that it comes from a justice minister who gave the NEC complete discretion to carry out the polls,' said Dr Beko Ransome Kuti. The electoral commission is directly responsible to President Babangida for the successful outcome of Nigeria's presidential poll. The rival National Republican Convention has also condemned the commission decision even though it looks set to lose if the result is announced. There were reports that the military government had tightened security across the country. In the mainly Moslem northern city of Kano, state radio said police banned unauthorised public gatherings and processions 'to avoid a breach of the peace'.</p>

			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Mobil to Enlarge Refinery: Mobil Corp. said it was expanding its largest U.S.  refinery located in Beaumont, Tex., at a cost of $300 million.  </P> <P> The expansion, scheduled to begin in the third quarter, will increase the  plant's capacity to 325,000 barrels a day of crude oil from the current 285,000  barrels. The bigger refinery will enable Mobil, the nation's second-largest oil  company after Exxon Corp., to substantially increase production of  higher-profit super unleaded gasoline and distillate fuels, such as home  heating oil. The project, which is expected to be completed by the third  quarter of 1992, will also reduce emissions from the plant.  </P></p>

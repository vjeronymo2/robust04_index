A taxi driver estimated that only about 10 percent of the  drivers continued with the strike yesterday. In front of the  communications building, taxis again formed a long line to wait  for passengers.    The driver said: The strike ended quickly as a result of the  involvement of the taxi company. The company issued a circular  to taxi drivers, saying that if they continued to strike, they  would not be allowed to hire taxis. The drivers had no  alternative but to return to work.    But some drivers who were still on strike said that they  would take further action after collecting views from people in  the same trade.</p>

Vishnevskiy, Moscow]    [Abstract] Cell cultures of allogeneic dermal fibroblast  were employed as transplants (28-280 cm[.sup]2[/]) and tested  for their efficacy in the treatment of burns in 28 13-53 year  old patients. In 15 patients with IIIa-IIIb degree burns  (12-55% body area), 12 subjects (80%) showed  epithelialization  within an average of 12.1 days. In 13 patients with IIIb-IV  degree burns (4-40% body area) epithelialization was  evident in  18-24 days in only 3 cases in whom the transplant was 60  cm[.sup]2[/] or less. In addition, 2 patients presented with  graft rejection, and in 3 subjects the transplant was degraded  with suppuration. Accordingly, these observations point to the  potential usefulness of using transplants prepared from  fibroblast cultures in the management of certain second and  third degree burns.

			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Survey of Kansai (4): A regional lesson for national rulers  -Politics: A look at an enduring consensus Japan's lurch over the past year into an era of unstable coalition governments has raised ironic smiles among Kansai politicians. Mainstream political parties, with the expection of the eccentric communists, have been working together in Kansai in what might be described as loose coalitions for many years. They may have a lesson to teach their national government colleagues in Tokyo, who struggle to achieve political stability in their fourth government within the space of a year. In Osaka and Kyoto, the two most populous of the six prefectures that make up Kansai, local governors and mayors are chosen by agreement between the main parties, and can count on cross-party support. Japan's tradition of consensus remains strong in Kansai politics, just as it is breaking down on the national stage. 'Politics here are entirely different from central politics. The Liberal Democratic party (LDP) is in a minority and other parties are very strong,' says Mr Hajime Ishii, member of parliament for the Japan Renewal party (JRP)  -a national reform-minded group formed in June last year - from Hyogo prefecture and former home affairs minister. Mr Teiichi Aramaki, an independent in his eighth year as governor of Kyoto, says the national political turmoil has had no impact on local politics. He and his prefectural colleagues are more interested in defending the interests of the community, than in waging backroom battles over political philosophy. The same habit of co-operation exists in Osaka. 'We decide our own policies, and the governor co-ordinates if there is a discrepancy. We all support the governor,' explains Mr Tokuo Nishikawa, secretary general of the left-wing Social Democratic Party (SDP) in Osaka. 'Communications between parties here are very good, and there is not much room for disagreement on the main policies,' says his opposite number at the Osaka branch of the conservative LDP, Mr Yoshio Matsui. The balance of power in Osaka, the biggest prefecture, is more or less in line with the national balance, with one exception. Komeito, the Buddhist-linked clean-government party, has a stronger than average showing there. It was founded in Osaka, and has strong support from lower middle class employees of the prefecture's legions of small subcontractors, says the SDP's Mr Nishikawa. Overall, the LDP has the strongest power base in Osaka, with 48 seats on the 104-seat prefectural assembly, followed by the SDP with 23, Komeito with 18, the Japan Communist party with 11, and three independents. Osaka politics may be different, but the need to maintain contacts in Tokyo is as crucial as ever. The region is dependent on central government in Tokyo for cash to fund its ambitious projects, such as a badly needed extension to Kansai airport - short of capacity before it even opens - and Kansai Science City. Traditionally, local politicians have relied on three clear lines of influence to defend their interests in central government; members of parliament; the LDP's sectoral lobby groups, known as zoku; and direct approaches to the government ministries concerned with particular issues. The weakening of the LDP and its formerly powerful zoku, due to its 11-month spell in opposition until returning to power at the end of June, means that local politicians will increasingly rely on direct lobbying to the government bureaucracy. 'It is a very slow system. It took us 10 years of lobbying to complete one runway for the new airport, and now we need another one. Over the past year, we have had a very hard time trying to get the budget for this. First the governor had to approach the Hosokawa cabinet, then a few months later there was the Hata cabinet, and now we are back in power,' says the LDP's Mr Matsui. The LDP, SDP, JRP and Komeito see eye to eye on the most important regional policies, to continue promoting Kansai's big public works projects, to lobby for greater budget independence from central government, and to channel more financial support to the small businesses that make up the backbone of the regional economy. In Kyoto, the main item on governor Aramaki's big-ticket shopping list is a new government guesthouse in the grounds of the city's former imperial palace. He thinks it is high time the Japanese government lodged visiting dignitaries in a traditional Japanese-style house, rather than the present miniature of Versailles in central Tokyo. If Mr Aramaki gets his wish, which hangs on a central government decision due in the next few months, he hopes to persuade the government to hold the Group of Seven annual summit in Kyoto, when it is Japan's next turn to host the G7 in 2000. One of the most pressing concerns for the JRP's Mr Ishii is to give greater control over fiscal policy to the prefectures. 'At the moment, two thirds of the region's taxes go to central government, yet two thirds of regional spending is made by local government. That means one third of tax revenues have to be transferred from central to local government. We need direct local taxation,' he says. That, argues Mr Ishii, will be the key to transferring more power from central government to the regions. This has been a subject of much political debate and little concrete progress for the past decade, briefly relaunched by Mr Morihiro Hosokawa's reform-minded government last year. 'Transferring more power to local government is a very slow business, because we are still rooted in the strong central government traditions of the Meiji era,' says Mr Ishii, referring to the birth of modern Japan in the late 19th century. Mr Nishikawa, of Osaka's socialist group, believes central government is becoming more sensitive to demands for decentralisation. At the LDP, Mr Matsui says his most important policy issue is to expand the volume of low-interest loans for small businesses, to help them survive the impact of the yen's rise. Here he is hoping to expand support for local trust banks and farmers' co-operatives, which, unlike other banks, are controlled by the prefecture rather than the ministry of finance in Tokyo. Mr Matsui argues: 'The yen's rise companies all the way down the line, but the smallest ones at the end of the chain of subcontracters are the most vulnerable. We must do what we can.'</p>

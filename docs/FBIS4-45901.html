			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Erik Bjorn Moller: "HIV Law Would Make Demands </F> on Sex Life"]    [Text] A new law that would criminalize sex between  HIV-infected persons and others will hardly have any significant  consequences in itself. The law would primarily be a signal to  the Danish people that they should use condoms.  <H5>  Rules Must Change </H5>   This was stated by Justice Minister Erling Olsen (Social  Democrat) to BERLINGSKE TIDENDE after the Supreme Court  acquitted an HIV-infected 36-year-old Haitian man on Thursday  [14 April]. The man had been accused of having unsafe sex with  23 women.    As early as Tuesday the legal affairs spokesmen of the  coalition parties met in an effort to close the loophole in the  law that led to acquittal of both the Haitian and an Arhus woman  on Thursday.    "If you do not protect your partner, you will be convicted.  We will no longer accept situations such as these," Olsen said.    It is now up to Justice Ministry officials to work out a  foundation that the politicians can discuss on Tuesday.  According to BERLINGSKE TIDENDE's information, it is now being  decided whether the new law "On the Spread of the HIV Infection"  will be integrated into the penal code or whether an entirely  new and independent law should be passed. At the same time,  various aggravating circumstances are being considered, such as  whether anal sex and other sexual acts should increase the  punishment. But the big question is whether a violation of the  law should result in fines or imprisonment. One possibility is  to consult the penalties for assault when determining the  punishment.    Dr. Michael von Magnus of the Board of Health fears that a  new law would inhibit "infection-detecting activities" since,  "even though it is illogical, people will become more afraid."    "Strictly from the standpoint of health care, there is no  indication that laws help prevent sexually transmitted diseases.  But I understand full well that there are other considerations  in play, namely people's sense of justice," Dr. von Magnus said.</p>

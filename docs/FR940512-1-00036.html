			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed &sect;364.6 would define and address the use of ``program income'' for grantees under the IL programs authorized under title VII of the Act. Program income could be used for additional program expenditures or as a deduction from total allowable costs, but not to meet the non-Federal share requirement under 34 CFR 365.12(b). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;364.7 would incorporate section 19 of the Act that permits the carryover of unobligated Federal funds from one fiscal year to the next. However, pursuant to the 1993 Amendments, proposed &sect;364.7(b) would not permit recipients of discretionary grants under sections 722 and 752 of the Act to carry over Federal funds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;364.13 would implement section 706(a) of the Act concerning when the Secretary may withhold, reduce, limit, or terminate payments to a State under chapter 1 of title VII of the Act. The Secretary has revised proposed &sect;364.13 to make it more consistent with section 107(c), which is incorporated into title VII of the Act through section 706(a)(2)(A). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;364.20 would implement the State plan requirements in section 704 of the Act. These requirements relate to the State plan's form and content, duration (three years), development, and periodic review and revision (at least once every three years), and to public hearings on the State plan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;364.20(c) would incorporate the requirement in section 704(a)(2) of the Act that the designated State unit (DSU) and the Statewide Independent Living Council (SILC) must jointly develop the State's IL plan and that the Director of the DSU and the chairperson of the SILC must jointly sign the State's IL plan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;&sect;364.20(d) and 364.22(c) would incorporate the statutory requirement in section 704(a) as it applies to the development and submission of a State's IL plan under section 704 of the Act and part 364. Section 704 of the Act requires a single State IL plan to be developed and signed by the DSU and the SILC. Nothing in the language of section 704 permits a DSU for individuals who are blind to submit a separate State IL plan for serving individuals who are blind. However, &sect;364.20(d) of the proposed regulations would require that, in a State where there is a separate State agency that is the sole State agency authorized by law to provide IL services to individuals who are blind, that separate agency for individuals who are blind also must be included in the development of, and sign, the State IL plan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;364.20(e) would require an assurance in the State plan that the DSU actively consults with the Director of the CAP authorized by section 112 of the Act during the development of the State plan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;364.20(g) would require an assurance in the State plan that the DSU conducts public meetings to provide all segments of the public, including interested groups, organizations, and individuals, an opportunity to comment on the State plan prior to its submission to the Secretary and on any revisions to the approved State plan. The Secretary revised proposed &sect;364.20(g) to explain more comprehensively what a State is expected to do to comply with section 704 (a) and (m)(6) of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, proposed &sect;364.20(h) would require an assurance in the State plan that, at the public meetings to develop the State plan, the DSU identifies those provisions in the State plan that are State-imposed requirements (i.e., requirements imposed by State rule or policy that are beyond what would be required to comply with the regulations in proposed 34 CFR parts 364, 365, 366, and 367). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to public comment on the draft regulations, the Secretary has added language to proposed &sect;364.21 that establishes the SILC's responsibility for funds it receives under section 705(e) of the Act and protects the SILC's independence. In addition, the Secretary has added language to this section that requires the State plan to include a description of the resource plan for the SILC that is required by section 705(e) of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;&sect;364.23 and 364.24 would revise the staffing and staff development requirements in existing 34 CFR 365.6 and 365.7 to reflect the changes made by the 1992 Amendments (Pub. L. 102&hyph;569) and the 1993 Amendments (Pub. L. 103&hyph;73). These requirements would apply to all service providers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;364.23(a) would require the State plan to include an assurance that service providers have personnel who are specialists in the development and provision of IL services to individuals with significant disabilities and in the development of and support to centers for independent living (centers). Proposed &sect;364.23(b) would require the State plan to include an assurance that service providers have personnel available who are able to communicate with applicants for and recipients of IL services under title VII of the Act who need special modes of communication or whose English proficiency is limited. In response to public comment on the draft regulations, the Secretary added language to this section to include specific examples of special modes of communication that should be available for individuals who need special modes of communication. Finally, proposed &sect;364.24 would require the State plan to include an assurance that the service provider has adequate staff development programs to ensure that staff are able to provide quality services to meet the needs of individuals with significant disabilities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

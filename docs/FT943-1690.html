			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Italians at odds over pensions Italy's right-wing coalition government last night failed to reach agreement with the powerful trade union movement over pension reforms linked to the 1995 budget. After a day-long series of tough negotiating sessions, the two sides agreed to meet again on Monday - but time is running out. An agreement on changes in Italy's costly state-run and deficit-ridden pensions system is central to preparation of the budget, which must be submitted to parliament by September 30. The lira weakened yesterday as dealers waited nervously for the outcome of the government-union negotiations. The currency was traded at L1,011 against the D-Mark, L8 down on the previous day; while share prices on the Milan bourse fell by nearly 2 per cent. After the first session of talks yesterday morning, the CGIL, largest of the three main trade union confederations, was threatening a general strike. Despite new proposals tabled by the government late in the evening, trade union leaders were still adamant in rejecting the government's position as inadequate. The government is seeking to raise close to L50,000bn (Pounds 20.3bn) through fresh revenues and spending cuts to hold the budget deficit to below 9 per cent of GDP. Of this, the government originally sought to find some L8,000bn in pension cuts. Yesterday, ministers were hinting the figure would be closer to L5,000bn - placing greater emphasis on more fiscal revenue.</p>

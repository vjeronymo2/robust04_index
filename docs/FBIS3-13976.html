Noting that the remarks recently made in Washington by the  U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for South Asian Affairs, Ms.  Robin Raphel, a spokesman of the Ministry of External Affairs  today said the comparison was grossly misplaced as the Afghan  situation was a by-product of the Cold War whereas Jammu and  Kashmir has been facing a massive campaign of terrorism aided  and abetted by Pakistan. The only link between the two was that  the weapons and mercenaries were moved from both Afghanistan and  Pakistan to foment trouble in Kashmir, the spokesman said.  [passage omitted]  *</p>

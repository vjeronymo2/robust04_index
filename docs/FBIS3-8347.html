			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] We have just received the letter sent by the  president of our country's Presidency Alija Izetbegovic to  German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel. It reads as follows:    Dear Sir:    In connection with your government's decision to deny  further  hospitality to the citizens of the so-called Federal Republic of  Yugoslavia, we wish to draw your attention to the fact that its  literal implementation could do a great injustice to certain  members of our nation. Namely, this decision also applies to  Muslim refugees from Sandzak who, as your excellency knows all  too well, have been the target of brutal repression by the  Belgrade regime. Those from Sandzak had to flee their homes due  to open police terror and also because they refused to be  mobilized by the Serbian army and to be forced to commit crimes  against the Croats and later against their brethren in Bosnia.  To our knowledge, most of these people in Germany today hail  from the municipalities of Novi Pazar, Sjenica, Tutin, Rozaje,  Bijelo Polje, Berane, Prijepolje, Priboj, Nova Varos, Plevlja,  and Plav.    I am pleading with you, Sir, to exempt these unfortunate  people from the decision on deportation, because they simply  have nowhere to return. They would be sent to prison or, worse,  to the front in Bosnia or Croatia the minute they crossed the  border, President Izetbegovic wrote in his letter to Klaus  Kinkel.</p>

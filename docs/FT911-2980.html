			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (39): The middle class looks beyond manana - Other people's money / Democracy has changed Spanish people's attitudes towards savings JUAN JOSE Suarez, a 43-year-old journalist and broadcaster in Madrid has, for a Spaniard, an almost unique problem. 'I am over-insured,' he complains. 'I have policies with Mapfre, with Winterthur, with Barclays Bank, with New York Life.' He also has two mortgages, a new car, three children and a charming American wife, Susan, of whose expensive decorating tastes he will occasionally complain, only to be instantly put in his place if he has failed to complain out of earshot. Juan Jose has no idea how much the family purse haemorrhages a month in insurance premiums for the two houses, the cars and the multiple life policies, but he is beginning to show signs of resistance. It was Susan, drawing on her Anglo-Saxon upbringing, who sold him on the idea of putting something away for the future. 'Our Spanish culture was very fatalistic,' he reminds enquirers, 'the natural enemy of insurance and prudence.' That childhood legacy probably still tears at him a little, though he acknowleges that, now that he and other middle-class Spaniards have become quite seriously wealthy, the sense that one should protect what one has has grown strong. 'We went very quickly from nothing to everything,' says Juan Jose. 'Now we worry about losing it. We worry about the durability and strength of the social-security system. I'm going to live a long time, and I know that spending money on insurance policies is not throwing it away.' The lack of provision made by a society that is rightly praised for its verve and zest for life meant that, by the time General Francisco Franco's protective and paternalistic 39-year dictatorship came to an end in 1975, Spain's savings rate was very low (statistically, it is traditionally high, but savings accounts are subject to quick turnover) and practically no attempt was being made, beyond the banking and savings bank networks, to attract saving. Low savings are still a problem for the Spanish economy, making it rely too heavily on the entry of foreign capital to finance its deficits. But, inevitably, the existence of a virgin market of 35m people was not going to be left alone for long. From the moment the democratic authorities began allowing foreign banks into the country, at the end of the 1970s, Spanish habits began, slowly, to change. Life insurance was a particularly stubborn nut to crack, and it was only when insurers began to market the fiscal advantages of their policies - rather than the Anglo-Saxon notion of preparing for old age or unexpected death - that people began to take notice. Still, by 1986, the industry had managed to sell only 2.1m policies to a probably small stratum of people who had enough money to actually worry about how to avoid paying taxes. In contrast, the mainstay of the insurance industry, car insurance, accounted for nearly 12m policies. That picture has changed in the past four years. Car insurance has become increasingly unprofitable as Spain's crammed roads and impatient drivers cause more and more accidents. But the rush of foreign entrants into the market, smothering the television and newspaper advertising markets with life policies and pension plans, and quickly copied by local institutions, has bulldozed its way through fatalism, disbelief and suspicion. By the end of 1989, the number of life polices had more than doubled to 4.4m. Car insurance, meanwhile, had grown just 16 per cent to 14.8m policies. Where Spaniards were spending just Pta 11,000 a head on insurance at the beginning of the 1980s, they were spending Pta 60,000 (Pounds 330) by the end of the decade. At the same time, a vicious battle was being waged between foreign and local banks, and local savings banks, to attract and, more important, hold on to savers. In late 1989, local banks finally laid their old interest-rate cartel to rest and began to compete directly for rich savers - offering high interest-bearing current accounts on amounts over Pta 1m. That has been an expensive exercise for the commercial banks, and the big savings banks are only beginning to compete, having first been forced to leave the insurance market. But while the growth of services and automation in Spanish banking has been spectacular (one savings bank is working on machines that would enable people to buy and sell shares), the most telling measure of change has been the quick growth of personal-pension funds since the government first allowed them to operate at the beginning of 1990. In their first year, about 150 new pension-fund managers were able to generate Pta 85bn-worth of business, but no one dreamed they would double that by the end of last year, to some Pta 170bn. According to Mr Jose Miracle, the government's pension-fund supervisor, 530,000 Spaniards now have their own pension plans. 'Its an incredible number,' he says. 'It's clear that, in this country, a certain layer of people have come to regard long-term savings as an absolutely essential cover.' Well, sort of. Talk to the Spaniards who are buying life policies and pension plans, and it quickly becomes clear why they are so attractive. Alfonso Moreno, a rich young financial analyst, quickly bought into a pension scheme. 'I did it for fiscal reasons,' he says, meaning that what he found attractive about the schemes is that they allow contributions of Pta 500,000 to be fully deducted from income tax and that a further Pta 250,000 is 15 per cent deductable. So what about old age and all that? 'Look,' he says, 'I'm irresponsible. I suppose if I were married I would do it differently.' It is probably a reflection of their professions, but Alfonso Moreno and Juan Jose Suarez approach buying their products in very different ways. Alfonso says that, when he wants to borrow money (he has, truly, just bought a Porsche), he shops around. 'You can save up to two points,' he says. As banks vie for business, Alfonso's favourite stopping-points at the moment are Barclays and the Caja de Catalunya, a Catalan savings bank. Juan Jose says he makes a point of 'never asking about the interest rate, just the length of time I have to pay the money back'. On the Pta 12m mortgage he has just taken out? 'I got a good deal - 10 years  - but I don't know what interest I'm paying and I haven't asked.' Juan Jose is probably the more typical Spanish borrower. Which probably explains why so many people are trying to lend him and the rest of the country money. The sheer spread of offers at least means he is spoiled for choice and is not going to get ripped off too badly.</p>

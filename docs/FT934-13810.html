			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / People: Adding up at KPMG The search is on for a new head of the tax discipline at KPMG Peat Marwick, the UK's second largest accountancy firm, following changes in all the senior positions. Gerry Acher was yesterday announced as the new head of audit and accounting, following the elevation of his predecessor, Michael Fowle, to become head of the firm's south-east practice. Fowle takes over from Colin Sharman, currently deputy senior partner, who becomes senior partner at the start of next year following the retirement of Jim Butler. Acher's current role as head of corporate finance is taken on by Neil Lerner, currently head of privatisations. He will probably continue to hold this existing job. Roger White, currently head of tax, will remain as the senior tax partner, but it is believed there will be a new head of the tax discipline, while White will concentrate more on practice protection. Tim Hayward is remaining head of insolvency. All the appointments except Sharman's have effect from the start of this month. But that leaves one vacant post from Christmas: deputy senior partner, which Sharman inherited when Bill Morrison retired, and which he will vacate from the start of 1994. KPMG is a firm with six regional partnerships, but with the south east accounting for 60 per cent of fee income. That has traditionally made head of the south-east the number two position in the firm. Sharman is still considering whether he will also need a new deputy senior partner, on top of a management team of about eight people to include the heads of the disciplines, and functional areas such as practice protection and risk management. Acher, 48, who led the firm on bid defence work including Hanson and ICI, BTR and Hawker Siddeley, and Whyte and Mackay and Invergordon, says there is still too much 'low-balling' or competitive fee-cutting between accountancy firms. One of his priorities is to give the firm a higher profile in the current audit and accounting debates. Jon Madonna, chairman and chief executive of KPMG Peat Marwick in the US, has also taken on the role of deputy chairman of the firm worldwide. Madonnna's new job, which has just been created, will give him responsibility for Asia/Pacific and Latin America, and for developing international marketing and communications.</p>

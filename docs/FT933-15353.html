			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / PIA plan attacked by Pru chief MR MICK Newmarch, chief executive of Prudential, Britain's largest life insurer, said the company would be an 'unwilling' participant in a proposed new self-regulating body if a current blueprint it was considering is adopted. He told the Financial Times Conference on Retail Regulation that a report by Sir Brian Jenkins, commissioned by the board of the proposed Personal Investment Authority, far exceeded the remit of a self-regulating body. Mr Newmarch renewed his call for direct statutory regulation of the financial services industry and abolition of the self-regulating framework. He called for a structure similar to that used to regulate building societies. Regulators needed certain powers now prohibited to them, such as the ability to ban the sale of inherently flawed products. After the conference, he said he doubted the PIA would come to fruition and the Prudential would not participate unless the majority of industry participants joined on a voluntary basis. Separately, Mr Andrew Large, chairman of the Securities and Investments Board, told the conference he had established a joint working party on disclosure with Fimbra and Lautro, the two self-regulating bodies for retail financial services. The working party will consider, among other things, recommendations from the Office of Fair Trading on disclosure as well as a proposal from Mr Tim Miller, an SIB consultant, to help consumers understand the costs of the products they buy. Mr Large said it was evident the disclosure regime for life insurance products proposed by the SIB did not go far enough in meeting consumers' desire for more information.</p>

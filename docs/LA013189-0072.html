			<p><P> January 31, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SENSE OF HISTORY, FEAR DRAW TRIAL SPECTATORS  </P> <P> College professor Ray Ceniceroz said he was there to witness a slice of Los  Angeles history. "It's like coming to see Queen Elizabeth," said the  54-year-old Arcadia resident.  </P> <P> Kristen Barnard skipped class at USC to attend, recalling still the fear that  swept Southern California three years ago. "It influenced my life a great  deal," she said. "I was so careful."  </P> <P> Abraham Persky, 66, a men's clothing salesman from Northridge, admitted he was  drawn to the courtroom by his fascination with the vagaries of justice. His  first impression was that the defendant's decision to wear sunglasses was  "ridiculous."  </P> <P> They had come, along with scores of others, to witness the opening Monday of  the Night Stalker trial. A capacity crowd in the courtroom of Superior Court  Judge Michael A. Tynan heard an opening statement and initial testimony against  Richard Ramirez, a 28-year-old drifter from El Paso accused of 13 murders and  30 other felony counts.  </P> <P> The courtroom, with room for about 75 spectators, was packed mainly with news  reporters and lawyers. About 20 members of the general public also were allowed  to file through a metal detector and take seats inside. Dozens more waited  outside, eager to get in. Some stood in line for hours.  </P> <P> Just before 11 a.m., bailiffs declared the courtroom filled, and Ramirez was  escorted to his seat at the defense table. The crowd watched silently, and the  only thing that could be heard was the jangling of the defendant's shackles.  </P> <P> Tynan called the trial -- which is expected to take more than a year -- to  order. The judge began by delivering a piece of distinctly Southern California  advice to the jurors: "I would think about jogging, lifting weights. You're  going to have to do something physical."  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Part to Play  </P> <P> Not everyone who came to the proceeding was drawn by spectacle. Jack Vincow  came because of his mother. He would be the first witness.  </P> <P> In June, 1984, Vincow found his mother, Jennie, 79, slashed to death in the bed  of her Glassell Park apartment. After the opening statement, the 50-year-old  pharmacist shuffled to the stand and began to describe the discovery.  </P> <P> "There was a neck gash that looked like someone attempted to remove her head  and nearly succeeded," Vincow testified in his pronounced Brooklyn accent.  </P> <P> Earlier, over a cafeteria lunch, he had discussed his unceasing trauma.  </P> <P> "The loss of someone close to you is painful to anyone," he said, "but the  difference with a loss due to natural causes and a loss due to vicious,  senseless, irrational violence is . . . beyond imagination."  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Need to Relax  </P> <P> Vincow said he was very close to his mother, and after her death had considered  taking tranquilizers. Instead, he turned to meditation.  </P> <P> "I chose for myself two simple words: calm and relaxed. Just think about them  and repeat them, two simple words to meditate on: calm and relaxed."  </P> <P> Vincow, who is currently writing a book about meditation, said he was not  nervous about testifying against Ramirez.  </P> <P> "I want to, number one, see that justice is done," he said.  </P> <P> In the hallway outside the courtroom, another man with a personal interest in  the case lingered. It was Ramirez's older brother, Julian. His gray sweat shirt  stood in sharp contrast to his brother's gray pinstriped suit and black  sunglasses.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Possibly, Hope for Some  </P> <P> Julian Ramirez would not comment on whether his brother is guilty, but  expressed hope that the case might make people aware about the dangers of  certain heavy metal lyrics said to fascinate his brother.  </P> <P> "Maybe," Julian Ramirez said, "he'll save some souls if people learn about that  kind of music."  </P> <P> Throughout the day, more than 50 would-be spectators were turned away.  </P> <P> "It's unfair," said Gee Goodwin, 31, a Jamaican native studying law in  Fullerton.  </P> <P> Goodwin said that hypothetical murder cases regularly are reviewed in the  criminal law class he had skipped Monday to attend the opening.  </P> <P> "But," he added, "the cases are not this ugly."  </P></p>

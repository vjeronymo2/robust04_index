			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Political Notebook: The surreal world of Major's enemy within So now we know. It is all Mr John Major's fault. Everything. 'Sleaze', ministerial sojourns at the Ritz, high taxes, rising crime rates, Sir Leon Brittan's demotion, confusion over the Post Office, the chaos at the Child Support Agency. That of course is a severely abridged list. How can we be so sure that the prime minister alone must shoulder the blame? Easy. Just spend a few minutes in the lobbies and bars of the House of Commons. It is there, not on the opposition benches of the Commons chamber, that Mr Major's real enemies still gather. They sit on the government back benches. They call themselves the Tory right. They are available any day, any hour: ready to whisper with ill-concealed glee and synthetic resignation how once again Mr Major has made a hash of it. The issue that originally brought them together - Europe - has temporarily slipped down the agenda during the pause between Maastricht and the 1996 intergovernmental conference. But it will return. And the bile and bitterness remain. The raison d'etre of these self-styled guardians of the Thatcherite flame is simple: to denigrate the prime minister. They never miss a chance. In this surreal world the abrupt return to their ranks of the sacked industry minister Mr Neil Hamilton is almost a cause for celebration. Mr Hamilton may be a fellow-traveller in trouble. But the manner of his departure hands them yet another stick with which to beat Mr Major. And now, of course, Mr Hamilton is free to say what he really thinks of the prime minister in whose government he served. The two dozen Tory MPs who peddle the poison in the Commons corridors of course are only a fragment of what was once recognisable as the party's right wing. The battle over Maastricht provided the illusion of a coherent power bloc. But in reality the Tory right has fractured and divided since the departure of Baroness Thatcher. Its thinkers - Mr Michael Portillo, Mr Peter Lilley, Mr John Redwood and Mr Michael Forsyth - are in government, bound - if sometimes only loosely - by the gag of collective responsibility. The heavyweights of the 1980s have retired hurt to the House of Lords. With the honourable exception of intellectuals such as Mr John Biffen and clever mavericks such as Mr Nicholas Budgen, that leaves little firepower on the back benches. Take the most bitter malcontents. One or two have influence among less committed colleagues. A few of the younger ones can look forward one day to a career in government - maybe. But the rest are never-has-beens or never-will-be's, the flotsam and jetsam of a party in power for 16 years. Sir George Gardiner, Mr John Townend, Mr John Carlisle and the like profess to worship the memory of Lady Thatcher. But she would not have them in her administrations. Nor will any other Tory prime minister, left, right or centre. Now, their views - crudely populist as well as intellectually inconsistent - are treated with mild embarrassment by their mentors in Mr Major's cabinet. Sir George wants income tax cuts now and billions slashed at a stroke from the welfare budget. Mr Portillo, his idol, dismisses as absurd the notion that a Conservative government could cut taxes while it is borrowing Pounds 30bn a year. Meanwhile, he is busy defending his employment budget from the Treasury axe. Messrs Portillo, Lilley, and Redwood are no friends of the prime minister, and regard him as weak. They nurture the power base on the back benches which prevents him from sacking any of them. But they are interested in winning the intellectual argument, not in sticking pins into Mr Major or in seeing him replaced in 10 Downing Street by Mr Kenneth Clarke. Among the younger irreconcilables - the self-styled Essex right of the 1992 intake - there are a handful interested in argument as well as sniping. Mr Iain Duncan-Smith is respected by those who mix in the same circles. Mr John Whittingdale speaks with the experience of several years as a close assistant to Lady Thatcher. But by and large the young malcontents are sure of little else but their dislike of Mr Major and a hatred of Brussels. Britain can and should be great again. But it is not their role to explain how. Therein lies the danger for Mr Major. His enemies are not susceptible to rational argument. They are not interested in the politics of pragmatism required to hold the Tory coalition together. They have no credible alternative, but they would delight in the destruction of the prime minister. They expect the forthcoming battle over Europe to provide the opportunity, by widening the net of discontent on the back benches and rebuilding the illusion of unity and intellectual coherence on the right. But watch out Mr Major - any excuse will do.</p>

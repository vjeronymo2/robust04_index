			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two comments were received regarding the elimination of provisions that provided coverage while cotton stored in modules remains in the field. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) One comment stated that changing the end of the insurance period from ``removal from the field'' to ``harvest'' creates some concerns which need to be addressed. Specifically, the comment asks how quality will be accurately determined for cotton stored in modules when the modules may be stored in the field for a significant period of time? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) One comment opposed the removal of coverage for modules stored in the field. The comment stated that: (a) Large amounts of cotton are stored in modules and that the practice allows for timely and efficient harvest of the crop; (b) losses do not occur frequently once cotton is moduled, but there is some risk of weather-related loss until the modules are removed from the field; and (c) continuing the practice of insurance coverage until removal from the field would be consistent with recent ad hoc disaster rulings that deemed weather-damaged, field stored modules eligible for assistance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Upon further review, FCIC has determined that coverage for modules stored in the field should be provided. Approximately seventy percent (70%) of the U.S. crop is stored in modules until ginning can take place, and cotton stored in modules is not as susceptible to loss as cotton remaining on the stalk. The provisions in section 8 (Insurance Period) have been revised accordingly. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One comment recommended either revising or deleting provisions that allow the insured to leave representative samples if they disagree with the insurer's appraisal. In the event the provision cannot be deleted, the comment recommended changing the provision so that the insurer can decide when using representative samples is appropriate. In many situations, samples are more susceptible to loss and do not accurately represent what the entire unit would have produced. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FCIC agrees that there are situations in which it may not be reasonable to leave representative strips from which production to count would ultimately be determined. The samples could be more vulnerable to damage than an entire field, or the insurer may be confident that the appraisal made accurately reflects production potential. However, the entire provision should not be removed. The provision has been changed to allow the insurer to determine those situations in which it is reasonable to leave representative samples to determine the amount of production to be counted. In cases where it is necessary to defer determinations the insured must be advised how production to count will ultimately be determined and the consequences of failure to leave or care for the samples. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One comment recommended that language in subsection 12.(b) be changed to require only one notice for prevented planting acreage rather than requiring notice three days after the final planting date and three days after the date the insured stops planting within the late planting period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The crop provisions provide two distinct periods during which the insured may be prevented from planting (i.e., by the final planting date and during the late planting period). The notice requirement allows the insurer the opportunity to verify that the acreage could not have been planted during such periods. FCIC agrees that an insured should only be required to give one notice if it is sufficient to cover all acreage for prevented planting purposes. Subsection 12.(b) has been modified to clarify that written notice must be given not later than three days after the final planting date for acreage the insured was prevented from planting by the final planting date, and not later than three days after the date the insured discovers that planting will not be possible if the insured was not prevented from planting such acreage by the final planting date but was prevented from planting such acreage during the late planting period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One comment indicated that the proposed provisions in paragraph 12.(d)(3) will allow an insured to request a written agreement for prevented planting coverage for acreage exceeding the policy limitations, and to subsequently enroll in a USDA program that allows less acreage to be planted. The comment recommended revising the paragraph to limit eligible acreage to the amount allowed by any applicable USDA program, regardless of when the insured enrolls in such program or any previously approved written agreement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FCIC agrees that, if the farm is enrolled in an USDA program that limits the number of acres planted, acreage in excess of the amount allowed under an USDA program should not be eligible for prevented planting coverage. Paragraph 12.(d)(3) has been amended accordingly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One comment recommended that language be added to paragraph 12.(d)(3) to allow prevented planting coverage by written agreement for acreage added to the insured's farming operation after the sales closing date. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The insurance period for prevented planting coverage begins on the sales closing date. Allowing additional coverage to attach after the beginning of this period would likely result in coverage being requested primarily when conditions are favorable for a prevented planting indemnity. This adverse selection should be avoided to help maintain an actuarially sound program and to keep premium rates from rising to cover such losses. The definition of ``written agreement'' has been amended to specifically disallow any prevented planting liability as a result of any request submitted after the sales closing date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the changes indicated in the responses to comments, FCIC has determined that: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The definition of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> skip-row  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> should reference United States Department of Agriculture qualification requirements for  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> skip-row  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> patterns. These requirements are used to determine the land area that is considered to be planted to cotton. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Provisions in section 6 (Insured Crop) are modified to allow coverage on crops planted into an established grass or legume in certain instances. The increased emphasis on Highly Erodible Land Conservation had made conservation tillage and no-till more acceptable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. New small grain and cotton varieties that mature earlier than previously available varieties make ``double cropping'' more practical. However, in areas where soil moisture may be depleted by the first crop planted, this practice may not be feasible or may result in significantly more risk to the insurer. To allow insurance for this practice, yet limit the insurer's vulnerability in areas where ``double cropping'' may not be practical, section 6 of the crop provisions have been modified to allow insurance for ``double cropped'' cotton only if allowed by a written agreement or the Special Provisions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, the rule, ``Common Crop Insurance Regulations; Cotton Crop Insurance Provisions'' published at 59 FR 28022 as revised as set out below is hereby adopted as final rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 457 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

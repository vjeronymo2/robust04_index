			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / International Company News: Magnum makes loss after write-offs MAGNUM, the New Zealand liquor group, yesterday announced net losses of NZDollars 233.36m (USDollars 125.27m) after extraordinary items for the year to June, a sharp turnaround on the previous year's profits of NZDollars 25.24m. Sales and operating revenues were NZDollars 820.92m, down from NZDollars 901.2m. The extraordinary items included NZDollars 264.3m written off for heavy losses made on the sale of non-core assets and other investments. In particular, Magnum wrote off NZDollars 89.7m on its 50 per cent investment in fellow liquor group Wilson Neill, which owns Tasmania's Cascade Breweries. Magnum paid 65 cents a share, and has written them down to 6 cents, saying it may write this off as well. Wilson Neill's share price has tumbled amid accusations of insider trading in its shares. Yesterday they sold at 4 cents. Other sums written off included a loss on the sale of its Countdown grocery chain, and various Australian investments that totalled a further NZDollars 58.7m. The group's New Zealand retail and wholesale grocery businesses were sold to Foodland Associated of Perth for NZDollars 175.3m, NZDollars 41.6m less than book value. However the directors said the group, which is controlled by Brierley Investments and Asia Pacific Breweries of Singapore, improved its forecast profits after tax and before extraordinaries. It earned NZDollars 30.9m, compared with the NZDollars 20m directors forecast in March. The result was helped by a better-than-expected result from sales of hotels owned by Austotel, the Australian hotel group, which contributed NZDollars 24.6m. The proceeds of the grocery businesses and hotel sales were applied to debt reduction. However, the directors said that in spite of the better-than-anticipated result, the quality of earnings was not satisfactory. Only Corban Wines performed well, as the group continued to face depressed trading conditions and competitive pressures and drastically reduced margins both in Australia and New Zealand. The company said sales by its core New Zealand liquor operations fell 3 per cent to NZDollars 777m, due to a drop in beer sales and higher taxes. However, Dominion Breweries finished the year strongly and maintained its market share. In Australia, Magnum's investments in retail and wholesale businesses were unsatisfactory, the directors said. Since balance date, Vintage Cellars had been sold to Coles Myer. The group was continuing negotiations with banks to replace debt facilities, and was considering additional funding. A rigorous programme to restore profitability was being continued.</p>

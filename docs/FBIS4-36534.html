			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by military correspondent Eytan Rabin] </F>   [Excerpts] An alert was declared yesterday along the  northern border and in south Lebanon following resumed exchanges  of fire between the terrorists and the IDF [Israel Defense  Forces] and SLA [South Lebanese Army]. At the same time, there  is no intention of reinforcing the army along the border and  inside Lebanon, although the alert is being maintained.  [passage omitted]    Sources in the defense establishment said yesterday that  mainly Hizballah is responsible for the shooting yesterday,  although it may be that other organizations took part in the  activity against the IDF. Army sources stressed that Hizballah  has quickly recovered from the air raid on the organization's  camp in Ba'labakk last week and resumed activity in the security  zone. This activity is comprised of firing katyushas, as well  as placing roadside bombs, remote-control explosive charges, and  trip wire charges.    IDF soldiers have been instructed to intensify patrols in  the  coming period in view of possible attempts by Hizballah  terrorist squads to infiltrate into the security zone. Major  General Yitzhaq Mordekhay, commander of the Northern Command,  yesterday stressed that, despite the resumption of the firing of  katyushas last week and yesterday, the terrorists have not  violated the agreements made at the close of Operation  Accountability last year. It is assumed that U.S. and Syrian  pressure made Hizballah stop firing katyushas at Israel last  week. At the same time, an IDF Intelligence Branch source said  recently that it is not inevitable that the firing of katyushas  at the northern settlements will resume. [passage omitted]    [Tel Aviv 'AL-HAMISHMAR in Hebrew on 9 June carries on page  2  a report by Aharon Klein and Betzal'el 'Amiqam citing remarks by  Deputy Defense Minister Mordekhay Gur at the Knesset yesterday,  during a discussion of the events on the northern border. Gur  said: "The message the Syrians have received over the last two  weeks is that they have no chance of closing the qualitative gap  between us. If they consider going back on the peace process,  they will know what they are faced with." Gur is further cited  as saying that "we will not accept terror, not even if it is  supported by Syria, and it is important that the Syrians know  this."]</p>

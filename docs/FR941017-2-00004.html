			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The current situation and outlook for sugar in fiscal year 1995 indicates that the probability of forfeiture of sugar pledged as collateral for price-support loans would be high without allotments, because estimated actual ending stocks are high and refined beet sugar prices, which softened in mid-September, were likely to fall further without allotments. Marketing allotments are expected to raise market prices to levels which will provide effective price support and avoid costs to the Federal Government. Any level of ending stocks at or above 1,279 TST determined to be ``reasonable'' would not trigger marketing allotments and would very likely leave market prices depressed at levels that would result in not achieving the price-support objectives and cause forfeitures of sugar held as collateral under the price-support loan program. A determination of reasonable ending stocks of less than 1,279 TST would trigger marketing allotments, which would have the effect of raising sugar prices by reducing marketings of sugar in fiscal year 1995. Therefore, a level of unrestrained ending stocks of 1,278 TST would be reasonable in light of the objectives of the sugar program of assuring an adequate supply of sugar to the U.S. market while supporting domestic sugar beet and sugarcane growers and also avoiding costs to the Federal Government. Accordingly, the quantity of sugar needed to be imported into the United States during the fiscal year in order to achieve such level of ending stocks would be less than 1.25 million short tons, raw value, in the absence of domestic marketing allotments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Establishment of Marketing Allotments for Crystalline Fructose <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 359b(c) of the 1938 Act provides that for any fiscal year in which sugar marketing allotments are established, the Secretary shall establish allotments for the marketing by manufacturers of crystalline fructose manufactured from corn, at a total level not to exceed the equivalent of 200,000 tons of sugar, raw value, during the fiscal year. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Overall Allotment Quantity <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 359c(b) of the 1938 Act provides that the Secretary shall establish the overall allotment quantity of sugar by deducting from the sum of the estimated sugar consumption and reasonable carryover stocks for the fiscal year (1) 1,250,000 short tons, raw value and (2) carry-in stocks of sugar. This formula yields an overall allotment quantity for sugar of 7,889 TST, calculated as follows: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=1 --> 9,247 (consumption) + 1,278 (reasonable carry-over stocks) ^ 1,386 (carry-in stocks) ^ 1,250 = 7,889. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Beet Sugar and Cane Sugar Allotments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to sections 359c (c) and (d) of the 1938 Act, the Secretary must establish overall beet sugar and cane sugar allotments by using percentage factors established in a fair and equitable manner on the basis of past marketings of sugar, processing and refining capacity, and the ability of processors to market the sugar covered under the allotments. Section 359c(f) of the 1938 Act provides that the cane sugar allotment shall be further allotted among the 5 States in the United States in which sugarcane is produced (i.e., Florida, Hawaii, Louisiana, Puerto Rico, and Texas) in a fair and equitable manner on the basis of past marketings of sugar, processing capacity, and the ability of processors to market the sugar covered under the allotments. Section 359d(a) of the 1938 Act provides for the allocation among processors of the State cane sugar allotments and the beet sugar allotment after such hearing and on such notice as the Secretary by regulation may prescribe, in such manner and in such quantities as to provide a fair, efficient, and equitable distribution of the allocations by taking into consideration processing capacity, past marketings of sugar, and the ability of each processor to market sugar covered by that portion of the allotment allocated to it. For purposes of these divisions of the overall allotment quantity, past marketings are based on the 1985&hyph;1989 crops, processing or refining capacity is defined as the highest crop year production of the previous 5 years, and ability to market is defined as the current crop year production estimate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / Arts: Today's Television Several new series and fresh batches of old series begin tonight. Voices From The Past (7.40 BBC2) are early sound films bringing back the age in which they were made. Tonight's offering, 'Giants And Pygmies', dates from 1935 when Armand Denis went on safari to the Congo. No Job For A Lady (8.00 ITV) is another run of the comedy in which Penelope Keith plays an unlikely Labour MP. Horizon, still the best science series, begins a fresh season with a programme about breast cancer (8.10 BBC2). Wildlife On One, starts another series with a film about chimpanzees in west Africa, claiming to show the 'true' life of these higher primates for the first time (8.30 BBC1). World In Action comes back with a programme about Borneo being denuded of hardwood trees for the sake of Japanese industry while Japan protects its own trees (8.30 ITV). The tediously trendy American series thirtysomething returns for what, according to Channel 4, 'seems to be' its final episodes (10.00). Otherwise Engaged promises to report on conversation in the women's lavatories of south Wales dance halls. You have been warned (10.55 C4).</p>

			<p><P> December 6, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOCKER SHOCKER;  </P> <P> GROWING NUMBER OF SCHOOLS ELIMINATE THE METAL BOXES  </P> <P> They're a rite of passage, a symbol of adolescence. But school lockers are now  becoming history in a small but slowly growing number of Southern California  schools.  </P> <P> Three Long Beach middle schools are the latest to lock lockers for good and  force students to, ever so grudgingly, schlep their books to and from home.  </P> <P> "It's too hard to carry all your books. Let me show you my history book," said  Jefferson Middle School student Jason Knowles, displaying a thick text. "Now,  picture eight of these," continued the eighth-grader, whose 75-pound frame  carries a heavy backpack daily.  </P> <P> What's a school without lockers?  </P> <P> To administrators and teachers, it's a quieter, safer, less troublesome place.  Kids get to class on time because they're not schmoozing by their lockers.  Hallways are no longer filled with the loud chorus of clanging metal doors.  School staff is freed from having to fix the lockers. And for some students,  there is one less place to stash drugs or weapons.  </P> <P> "It's called locker problems," said Diana Pichierri, principal of Desert  Springs Middle School, a new school in the Palm Springs Unified School District  that was built without lockers. "The lock is jammed, or somebody vandalized it,  or nasty things are written on them, or  'I-gave-my-combination-to-my-best-friend-and-I-hate-her-today-and-look-what-she's-done.'  I can guarantee (getting rid of them) saves some gray hair."  </P> <P> But to most teen-agers, a school without lockers is like a school without pep  rallies. On a practical level, carrying a backpack filled with textbooks, note  pads, gym clothes and other equipment is, well, heavy. And besides, lockers  signified a kid's arrival in the big leagues.  </P> <P> "I thought I would feel more grown up, older," said Dustin York, one of the  many disappointed newcomers to Jefferson Middle School looking forward to  getting a first locker. "But this is like an elementary school."  </P> <P> Principals at Jefferson, Franklin and Lindbergh middle schools in the Long  Beach Unified School District, on the other hand, have nothing but kudos for  the experiment, which may expand to the other 11 middle schools in the district  but has not yet been considered for the high schools. In other districts, the  concept has already taken hold in both junior and senior high schools from  Pasadena to San Bernardino to San Diego County.  </P> <P> "My hallways are cleaner. My custodian has time to do custodial things. My kids  have (more) time in the classroom. It's been a positive thing," said Linda  Moore, principal at Franklin Middle School.  </P> <P> At the Pasadena Unified School District, most students don't have lockers in  either middle schools or senior high schools, said Michael Klentschy, assistant  superintendent for instruction. As in the other districts, Pasadena school  officials assign lockers to students with special problems, such as medical  conditions.  </P> <P> In the San Bernardino City Unified School District, lockers in both middle  schools and high schools were removed in recent years to cut down on  maintenance costs, said Harold Boring, the district superintendent for  administrative services. It saves the district about $200,000 a year, he said.  </P> <P> In the Los Angeles Unified School District, South Gate Junior High School is  exploring the idea, according to Verna Stroud, the school improvements  coordinator. Elsewhere in the district, however, workers are fixing broken  lockers. Last year, the Los Angeles school board allocated $400,000 to repair  lockers, said Julie Crum, the district's assistant maintenance director.  </P> <P> While the advantages are many in getting rid of lockers -- or shutting them off  by placing long metal bars through them, as officials did in the three Long  Beach middle schools -- the main drawback is that children sometimes must carry  heavy book packs.  </P> <P> To check just how much they were carrying, San Bernardino school officials  gathered the textbooks and weighed them. The average load was about 12 pounds,  unless students were carrying all of their books with them, which raised the  weight to 26 or 27 pounds, according to Boring.  </P> <P> Khalilah Slaughter and Anitrica Howze are cousins, petite 11-year-olds who  share the same classes at Jefferson Middle School. They place all their books  in one large gym bag, which they take turns carrying. They complained of a need  for personal storage space beyond their physical education lockers, which are  small and out of the way.  </P> <P> Many of the students say their biggest beef is that it is burdensome to lug  their texts from home to school and back each day.  </P> <P> The benefits, however, have paid off, said Principal Candace Toft of La Mesa  Middle School in San Diego County. "We just don't find the things that we used  to. We're not finding the drugs and the weapons," she said.  </P> <P> Myrna Fujimoto, the principal at Jefferson Middle School, said one gun was  found hidden in a locker last year. "That was enough to convince me," she said.  </P> <P> Overall, however, principals at the three Long Beach schools say drugs and  weapons have not been a serious problem at their campuses.  </P> <P> And while youngsters such as Jefferson seventh-grader Jairo Olivos will clamor  for lockers ardently -- "We want our rights! We want lockers!" -- officials say  the metal boxes are neither a right nor, some argue, a venerable teen-age  tradition.  </P> <P> "Traditions change daily," Pichierri said. "I would rather think of it as a fad  that has lost its excitement."  </P></p>

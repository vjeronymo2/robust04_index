			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Democrats counter Bush tax cut plans DEMOCRATS in Congress have countered President George Bush's bid for a cut in the capital gains tax rate with a proposal to index all future capital gains to inflation. The indexation plan forms part of a Dollars 90bn (Pounds 49.7bn) tax reform package put together by Democrats on the ways and means committee of the House of Representatives, Congress's key tax body, in response to the Bush package backed by the Republicans. While Democratic party leaders have opposed a capital gains tax cut as a gift to the rich - they claim 70 per cent of the money would go to people earning over Dollars 100,000 a year - it became clear last week that many Democrat backbenchers favoured some form of cut. Mr Dan Rostenkowski, ways and means chairman, tried to craft a cut that would target middle income families by giving a bigger exclusion to those earning less than Dollars 100,000. But his committee opted for indexation, applied to all new assets except collectibles, on the grounds of simplicity. While indexation would still bring big benefits to the rich, a 1990 study by the Congressional Budget Office showed that the gains realised by lower income taxpayers contain a greater proportion of inflation than those realised by the wealthy. Many tax reformers have advocated indexation of capital gains on the grounds that much of the gain is merely the result of inflation, and does not represent a real income rise. This was one of the reasons given this year by the US Treasury for the cut proposed by Mr Bush to a top rate of 15.4 per cent for long term gains. Congressional aides expect indexation to cost Dollars 3.5bn in lost revenue over the next six years, and in the short term the measure might even bring in some additional revenue, as investors roll over their assets to establish a new base for indexation.</p>

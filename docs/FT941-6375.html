			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Can Europe Compete?: Prospects lie in IT's rapid rate of change - Electronics Europe's contribution to the evolution of information technology in the two decades following the invention of the microprocessor has been strong in telecommunications but weak in microelectronics and computing. One measure is commercial success. Of the world's 12 leading telecoms equipment companies in 1991, seven were European. Compare this with Europe's overall position in information technology: only 12 of the world's top 100 IT companies in 1992 were European-owned, according to Datamation magazine. Europe's top three, Siemens-Nixdorf, Olivetti and Groupe Bull, continue to lose money heavily. Europe's strength in telecoms is chiefly a consequence of protected markets. Most European telecoms authorities and their suppliers continue to enjoy the protection of regulated and monopolistic regimes. The European electronics and computer companies have never had similar protection but their relative failure involves complex factors including recession, inadequate finance and insular markets which do not encourage economies of scale. Europe's weakness also has much to do with its consistent failure to contribute technically to the IT revolution. It seems continually to be catching up rather than leading. Meanwhile, the US is ploughing ahead with plans for a national information highway, for example, while Europe is still debating the issue. There is an exception. France invented, developed and championed the 'smart' or computer card. It has now been adopted all over the world for applications ranging from an electronic key to an electronic wallet. The world market for microprocessors, nevertheless, is owned by the US companies Intel and Motorola. Packaged software, both systems and applications, is dominated by US suppliers such as Microsoft and Lotus. The design of large computer systems has been increasingly relinquished to the US and Japan. How serious is the situation for Europe? Mr Pasquale Pistorio, chief executive of SGS-Thomson Microelectronics, puts it bluntly: 'No advanced industrial society can exist without controlled access to an advanced electronics industry, which in turn cannot exist without controlled access to an advanced semiconductor industry.' This sort of thinking has generated a raft of attempts to turn the tide, chiefly in the form of EU research programmes encouraging pan-European collaboration in 'pre-competitive' research. Last year EU ministers decided that information technology should have the lions' share (28.2 per cent or about Pounds 3bn) of the budget for the Framework Research programme extending from 1994-98. It will be the fourth such programme. Has the money been well spent? There have been some successes. EU funds, for example, went into the development of the ARM microprocessor, a small, fast chip designed for high-volume production and well suited to tiny computers and games machines, which has been adopted by Apple for its Newton pocket computer. On the other hand ES2 - once hailed as the greatest success of the Eureka programme, a Europe-wide initiative supporting market-oriented research - has failed to live up to the highest expectations. The ES2 story is instructive. The company, based in France and owned by a consortium of European industrial groups, was founded to exploit what was thought to be a large emerging market for chips which could be quickly customised by electron beam for specific applications. At first it looked likely to fulfil its promise, then the technology changed and chips which could be tailored more cheaply gained a hold on the market. ES2 remains profitable but it has not been a success on the scale envisaged. 'The analysts got their forecasts wrong,' says Mr Robin Saxby, formerly at ES2 and now chief executive of chip-maker ARM. Europe's best hope for the future seems to lie in the phenomenon which damaged ES2's prospects - the dramatic rate of change in the IT industries. No European chip maker could hope to capture a share of the personal computer microprocessor market; but the trend is to smaller devices, opening a window for ARM.</p>

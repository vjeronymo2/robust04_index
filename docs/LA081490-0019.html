			<p><P> August 14, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CHANEL FETES LOCAL LADIES AT TEA PARTY;  </P> <P> TEA TOTALING  </P> <P> Eighty-five of the county's A-list hostesses gathered at the Ritz-Carlton hotel  in Laguna Niguel on Friday for high tea and a fashion show. The party was  underwritten by the fashion house Chanel in honor of the benefit committee for  the September gala opening of a Chanel boutique in South Coast Plaza. The Costa  Mesa store will be the 11th U.S. shop operated by the French clothing empire  founded by the late Coco Chanel. Of the guests, only a few wrapped themselves  in Chanel suits and dresses or dropped their lipstick and wallets into one of  Coco's gold-chain shoulder bags. No problem, said Barbara Cirkva, a Chanel  senior vice president who spoke briefly to the group before the show. "We just  view (the party) as something for a lot of likely customers," she said.  </P> <P> Dressed for Darjeeling  </P> <P> Likely customers included Donna Bunce and Gayle Anderson, co-chairs of next  month's $300-per-couple store opening, a benefit for Opera Pacific. Asked for  the name on the label of her smart suit, Anderson emphatically declined. "No,  no, no, no!" she said, laughing. Translation: not a Chanel. Bunce dropped the  magic words "classic" and "timeless" regarding Coco's design legacy; as for her  own non-Chanel party outfit, Bunce dropped to the bottom line. "Chanel is the  most expense design house in the world," she said. How expensive? Well, Kasia  Johnson, chairwoman of this year's Opera Ball, was recently checking the goods  at the Chanel boutique in Beverly Hills. "I fell in love with this wonderful  suit," she said. "It was $12,000." Oh. Anne Badham didn't wear her Chanel, but  only because she "didn't really think about it." She explained: "I have this  gorgeous white raw-silk spring suit, but it was in the back of the other  closet, and I didn't think about digging it out." Peggy Goldwater Clay, in a  peach-toned pantsuit she called "my catalogue item," allowed as how she liked  the Chanel makeup and shoulder bags but found the clothes "not for me." Sandy  Beigel joked that the dress she wore was "from France -- so that's close,  right?" Michelle Rohe, who spent the social hour chatting with her friend  Elaine Havelock Heinz, reached into her closet and came out with the real thing  -- a classic, timeless navy-blue Chanel dress.  </P> <P> The Program  </P> <P> A harpist played during the social hour as the be-hatted tea group mingled and  sipped Perrier Jouet champagne and Vittel water. Sitting with friends of their  own choosing (at the place-card-free tables), guests were served finger  sandwiches, scones, fruit tarts and a selection of teas as Cirkva gave a brief  speech and leggy models stepped one by one onto a platform set at the front of  the room.  </P> <P> Also Seen  </P> <P> Benefit honorary chairwoman Jeanette Segerstrom and committee members Lois  Aldrin, Floss Schumacher, Pat Allen, Mary Lou Hornsby, Candy Schnapp, Lillian  Fluor, Ruth Ding, Marilyn Nielsen, Ruth Ann Moriarty, Ruth Segerstrom, Sue  Perewozki, Arlene Cheng and Elaine Redfield.

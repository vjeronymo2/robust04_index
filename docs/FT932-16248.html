			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / Socialist power struggle nears climax in Spain A POWER struggle inside Spain's ruling Socialist party has spilled into the open, virtually ensuring that a clear defeat or victory will emerge for Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez when the party executive meets on Saturday. It could force the resignation of Mr Gonzalez as party leader. Efforts by senior Socialists failed yesterday to paper over cracks caused by disagreements between the prime minister and Mr Alfonso Guerra, the left-wing deputy party leader and former deputy prime minister, over charges that the party illegally financed itself in the late 1980s. Mr Gonzalez and other conservative members of the cabinet and the party are pressing for early resignations of senior party personnel in the face of the scandal, which is hurting the Socialists in advance of elections later this year. Mr Guerra and the party's chief administrator, Mr Jose Maria Benegas, deny anyone in the party is to blame. Mr Guerra and Mr Benegas have released a letter written by Mr Benegas to Mr Gonzalez last Thursday in which he appeared to offer to resign. In the note, he accuses members of the government of trying to topple him by blaming him for the scandal and of breaking the traditions of loyalty and solidarity in the party. The bitterly worded note was being interpreted more as a call to arms than a resignation offer. Supporters of the left-wing party apparatus led by Mr Guerra and Mr Benegas were yesterday lobbying hard before the Saturday executive meeting. Mr Gonzalez has made it clear he will be seeking political, rather than legal, responsibility from the meeting. He has suggested that he will be prepared to step down as party leader - and thus probably not lead the party in the next election - if no one else does. A problem for the prime minister and his supporters is that they do not command a natural majority on the Socialist executive. Mr Guerra does, though this is no guarantee that, faced with an election disaster if Mr Gonzalez goes, the executive would sacrifice Mr Benegas or Mr Guerra. Tension between the two sides, who accuse each other of destroying the Spanish economy and the Socialist vote, is now so intense that some senior party members were speculating that if Mr Gonzalez fails to get his way on Saturday he will call a quick general election as revenge. The Socialists would do badly, possibly would not even be able to form a coalition unless the financing scandal is resolved.</p>

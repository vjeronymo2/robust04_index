L. 95-452, as amended, 5 U.S.C. App.) (IG Act). The OIG is an independent unit within the Board which was established to promote economy, efficiency, and effectiveness in the administration of Board programs and operations and to detect and prevent fraud, waste and abuse in such programs and operations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Board is establishing two new systems of records, pursuant to the Privacy Act, entitled: (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> OIG Investigative Records <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , and (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> OIG Personnel Records <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . These systems of records are essential for the Board's OIG to perform the duties assigned to that Office by the IG Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The system called  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> OIG Investigative Records <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (designated BGFRS/OIG-1 below) will consist of files and records compiled by the OIG on Board employees or other persons involved with the Board's programs or operations who have been or are under investigation for criminal or civil fraud and abuse related to the Board's programs or operations. The Board's Inspector General has the authority to conduct such an investigation under the IG Act. These files and records include materials maintained in electronic and hard copy form including databases for case tracking, ``Hotline'' telephone call logs, investigator notes, case files, and memoranda or letters. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The system of records called  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> OIG Personnel Records <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (designated BGFRS/OIG-2 below) will consist of files and records compiled by the OIG on past, current, and prospective employees of the OIG for use in the management of the Board's OIG. These files and records include materials maintained in electronic or hard copy form, several databases including the OIG Time Entry System, and files on individual employees maintained and used by the OIG. The information in the system of records is used for making and tracking assignments and for assessing individual employee progress on assignments as well as for evaluating employees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board proposes to exempt certain files within these two new systems of records from disclosure to individuals who are the subject of a record in the system. The exemptions would cover only files compiled for the following purposes: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Investigative material compiled for law enforcement purposes; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Investigatory material compiled solely for the purpose of determining suitability, eligibility, or qualifications for employment by the OIG, but only to the extent the disclosure of such material would reveal the identity of a source who furnished information to the Board or OIG under an express promise of confidentiality. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> This information in these two new systems is proposed to be exempt under the authority of 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2) and (k)(5). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), the system of records designated as  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> OIG Investigative Records <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (BGFRS/OIG-1) also shall be exempt from certain parts of the Privacy Act insofar as the records are maintained by a Board component which performs as its principal function any activity pertaining to the enforcement of criminal laws and which consists of: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Information compiled for the purpose of identifying individual criminal offenders and alleged offenders; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Information compiled for the purpose of a criminal investigation, including reports of informants and investigators, and associated with an identifiable individual; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Reports identifiable to an individual compiled at any stage of the process of enforcement of the criminal laws from arrest or indictment through release from supervision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> The system is exempt from the provisions for the following reasons: notifying an individual at the individual's request of the existence of records in a criminal investigative file pertaining to such individual, or granting access to such an investigative file could: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (A) Interfere with investigative and enforcement proceedings and with co-defendants' right to a fair trial; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) Disclose the identity of confidential sources and reveal confidential information supplied by these sources; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) Disclose investigative techniques and procedures; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (D) Be inconsistent with Federal laws and rules governing disclosure of such information in certain circumstances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552a(r), a report of these new systems of records is being filed with the President of the Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.

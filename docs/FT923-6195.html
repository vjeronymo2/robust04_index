			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / The Markets Under Strain: Obligations of European ERM members MEMBERS of the European exchange rate mechanism are obliged to intervene in foreign exchange markets to support currencies above their agreed floors during European trading hours, writes Emma Tucker. This means that unlike the dollar, ERM currencies have a guaranteed floor beyond which the market cannot push them. If, for example, the pound or lira were to hit their floors, the UK and Italian central banks would move in with open bids to buy the currency at that rate, thereby guaranteeing a sale for foreign exchange dealers. In practice central banks are likely to take action before their currencies reach their outer limits. Yesterday the lira and sterling moved within fractions of their floors but moved back up before the Bank of England and the Bank of Italy were obliged to intervene. The obligation to intervene means countries may have to draw on their reserves, sometimes very heavily. The European monetary system provides for a very short term financing facility (VSTF) under which unlimited credit is automatically available to finance intervention. Another option is to raise short term interest rates. The system also provides for realignments in which currencies may be devalued or revalued but the presumption is that such a move is a last resort. Realignments must be agreed between all EMS members.</p>

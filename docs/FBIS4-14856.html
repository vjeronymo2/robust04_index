			<p>BFN     [Text] Vyacheslav Marychev, elected to the Russian State  Duma on the party ticket of Liberal-Democrats, has been expelled  from the party. This was reported to the press on Monday by  Marychev himself. He said he was notified by the party leader  Vladimir Zhirinovsky just before the 5th congress of  Liberal-Democrats held in Moscow last Saturday. He also said  that security guards did not let him into the Central Tourists'  House where the congress was held even though the convention was  open to everyone.    Marychev said his expulsion had been caused by a number of  speeches in which he actively resisted the so-called imperative  mandate being given to party groups. It would give groups the  right to strip members of the State Duma elected on party  tickets of their mandates.    During a visit to St.Petersburg before the congress  Zhirinovsky repeatedly declared that Marychev who used to lead  the local branch of the Liberal-Democratic Party accepted  bribes, in particular from Russia's Choice, for making  statements directed against the leader.    Marychev said he was ready to sue Zhirinovsky for libel if  the conflict is not settled. However, in reply to a question  from Interfax he said he was not disappointed in Zhirinovsky as  a person. He said he still considers the party leader a talented  politician.    The decision of the congress to make Zhirinovsky the party  chairman till 2004 and grant him absolute power between  congresses contradicts party rules, said Marychev.    Members of the State Duma Vyacheslav Marychev, Viktor  Kobelev  and Alexander Pronin expelled by Zhirinovsky from the  Liberal-Democratic Party are planning to hold a news conference  at the State Duma on Wednesday.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Italian Research and University Minister </F> Umberto Colombo by MEDIA DUEMILA correspondent Giampiero  Gramaglia, place and date not given: "Support For Research To  Increase Employment" -- first five paragraphs are MEDIA DUEMILA  introduction]    [Text] Umberto Colombo follows the tradition started by  Antonio Ruberti (and immediately interrupted) of having a  scientist who is a specialist at the ministry of research and  universities. During this interview with MEDIA DUEMILA, Colombo  describes the difficulties of a ministry, that more than many  others, and with less justification, is being affected by the  sacrifices of a period of crisis.    He was, almost without interruption, president of the ENEA  [National Agency for New Technologies, Energy, and the  Environment] from the end of the seventies to his nomination as  minister in May. Colombo is 66 years old and comes from  Leghorn, the same city as Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the prime  minister.    He graduated with a degree in physical chemistry from Pavia  and then taught applied chemistry. Between 1967 and 1979 he was  director of the Donegani research institute and was, therefore,  responsible for the development strategies of Montedison. In  1979 he was nominated president of what was then the CNEN (today  ENEA), a position that he left for a period of four months  (November 1982-February 1983) to take on the presidency of ENI  [National Hydrocarbons Corporation]. He returned to the CNEN in  March 1983, at the time when the CNEN became the ENEA.    Whilst he was president, ENEA changed from being responsible  for nuclear energy at a national level, to managing three types  of initiatives: the new technologies, energy (not just nuclear  energy), and the environment. In recent years, under the  guidance of Colombo, the attention of the ENEA has turned to the  problems of global climatic changes (the greenhouse effect) and  of development that is in harmony with our resources.    Umberto Colombo is on the executive committee of the Rome  club, and is a member of the Academia dei Lincei. In 1984 he  won the Honda international prize for environmental technology.    [MEDIA DUEMILA] Italy is the G7 country that spends the  least on research as a percentage of GNP. You denounced this  situation more than once before you became minister. What are  you doing now, and what do you intend to do to change this  situation? What margins do you have for maneuvers in the  current context of reductions in public expenditure?    [Colombo] We know that Italy's financial commitment to  research and higher education is rather modest when compared to  that of the other countries that we are usually compared with  and we are doing everything possible to balance this situation  despite difficulties regarding public funding. R&amp;D  expenditure  is about 1.4 percent of GNP. This is about half what the other  major western countries spend. The universities are in a  similar situation. Not only does Italy have a low level of  expenditure, but the efficiency with which this expenditure is  managed is also weak.    The most significant room for maneuver that we have at this  time is that of improving efficiency and effectiveness. We are  putting a lot of effort in this direction, using a number of  different mechanisms: the coordination of programs, the  evaluation and checking of the merit of research projects that  are supported by public funding, and the streamlining of  procedures.    [MEDIA DUEMILA] Italian research has often had little to do  with industrial applications and production. It has given  priority to the fundamental and theoretical aspects. What do  you think can be done to assist the transfer of innovation to  industry, and eventually through the introduction of laws? How  do you think any such action could improve the competitiveness  of the Italian system and, furthermore, influence economic  recovery and employment?    [Colombo] By nature research must be subdivided into several  levels, ranging from free basic research, to that with a  fundamental direction, and the applied research that is  conducted by industry. The problem is that of establishing forms  of coordination between these various levels, singling out the  subjects that are also of strategic importance for university  and public research in such a way as to create the conditions  required for technological development.    We are putting these guidelines into practice by creating  special commissions to direct research leading to the main  socioeconomic goals that are of interest to the country.    Every program should be monitored by expert evaluators from  now on. They will also see to the exploitation of the results  that are obtained in order to help transfer the results of  public research. Then the peer review methods that are usual in  advanced countries will also be applied in Italy.    The effort of bringing our industry up to the potential of  international competition requires the technological development  that is obtained from being able to translate the results of  research into innovation, particularly by favoring small and  medium-sized companies. We are therefore promoting and  reinforcing public and private instruments to support these  actions: technological information bureaus, information  networks, and networks providing company support and bringing  the researchers in specific geographical areas together.  Support for valid research is also a condition for maintaining  and structurally developing employment in the country. Our  culture has not understood well that it is only possible to keep  jobs by promoting competitive production at an international  level and quickly preparing products to meet a demand that is  rapidly evolving. Technology is the key instrument for  attaining these goals.    [MEDIA DUEMILA] In which sectors of advanced research do you  think Italy is best placed in a European and world context? On  the other hand, in which sectors do you think the greatest  efforts should be made? I would like your reply to concentrate  on the sectors that are potentially strategic for the "Year 2000  Horizon" including telecommunications, computers, semiconductors  and biotechnologies.    [Colombo] It is true that generally speaking Italy holds an  inferior position on the scientific and technological front with  respect to the other advanced countries. However, it is also  true that our research system is capable of exhibiting peaks of  high, or extremely high, qualification in certain sectors. This  is often thanks to individual researchers, or excellent small  research groups. The problem is that these peaks cannot be  amassed, or become a structural school.    The main exception to this picture is that of high energy  and  nuclear physics, where the great traditions of the Italian  school have been maintained in a preeminent position at an  international level. We must try to develop these points of  excellence in order to generate science-based productive  activities around them.    We are behind in the dominant and emerging technologies,  such  as computer science, advanced materials, and the new  biotechnologies. Therefore our effort is being aimed at finding  the strong points that can be levered, and these are not lacking  here either, and singling out the scientific and technological  segments that are structurally valid. In order to do this, we  need to work closely with industry. Industry can work alongside  the State effort, if we have a more longsighted strategic vision  than at present.    [MEDIA DUEMILA] Italian research has never played the role  of a lion at an EC level; and it has rarely managed to get a  slice of the EC funding cake that was even equal to the sums  paid in. Furthermore, the participation of small and  medium-sized companies in EC programs has hitherto been less  than was expected. What initiatives have you taken, or do you  intend to take to avoid delays and shortages? As far as the new  EC research program for the coming years is concerned, what  activities do you think Italian interest should be concentrated  on?    [Colombo] Italy does not manage to obtain the just return  for research with respect to the contributions paid to the  European Community. What are the reasons for this? A small  volume of industrial research that mainly has short-term goals  can only make the acquisition of European contracts difficult.    Analogously, the small amount of internationalization of the  companies, particularly the small companies, makes it difficult  for them to find partners in other countries, and this is  necessary to have access to EC funding. We are working to  improve this situation by reinforcing the technical support  structures at the ministry, with the inclusion of a strong  industrial component, that had little presence before.    [MEDIA DUEMILA] What is your opinion of the research  priorities that have been hitherto suggested by the EC research  programs that have been managed by Italian commissioners and by  EUREKA [European Research Coordination Agency] since 1989? Do  you think that the innovation gap between Europe and the world  partners, the United States and Japan, is closing up or widening?    [Colombo] Unfortunately we must recognize that, although  praiseworthy efforts have been made, the gap is widening, and  Europe is losing ground. This is due to the fact that it has  not known how to gain competitive advantage from new factors  that were not its traditional ones. This does not mean that the  EC and EUREKA programs have not been useful. In fact, without  them, things would have been undoubtedly worse. They have not  sufficed, because they have not been aggressive enough. The  definition of EC programs takes an intrinsically long time, and  the "bottom-up" type process of EUREKA finishes with dispersive  choices being made. Lengthy timing, too many projects, little  concentration of resources, and above all a conservative  attitude that does not completely renew goals and productive,  organizational, and administrative structures, are the European  problems, that EUREKA and the EC programs do not manage to  overcome, but only to ease.    [MEDIA DUEMILA] You have recently spent four months as a  commissioner of the Italian Space Agency. Are there conditions  for relaunching Italian space activity, and if so what are they,  and how are they set out?    [Colombo] The space agency is coming out of a state of  crisis that has characterized the last few years of its work.  This has, in part, been due to the problems that were created  by the lack of a clear definition in the law that set it up.  The space sector is a sector that looks to the future. Here  Italy has won a position of respect, both in Europe, and at a  world level. We need to make better use of the resources  available. Amongst other things, we must create a better  synergy than in the past between civilian space and military  space, given that the international political picture has  changed, and consequently the technological goals that defense  must have in the space sector are different. More in general,  and not just with reference to space, it is important to focus  on the problem of the so-called "dual use" products, so that the  general crisis of the defense industry does not strike again on  the national production machine.</p>

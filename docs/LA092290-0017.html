			<p><P> September 22, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. FANS ARE THRILLED (IN THEIR SPECIAL WAY) THAT RAIDERS WILL STAY  </P> <P> It's sure nice to find out that all the hard-working politicians and others  interested in community betterment have finally got Al Davis' signature on a  contract to ensure "our" hallowed Raiders playing in the Coliseum until at  least somebody comes by with a better offer.  </P> <P> Nice job, Spectacor, Coliseum Commission and and all concerned. Look for me in  Anaheim.  </P> <P> BOB GEORGE  </P> <P> Covina  </P></p>

Antelo said the 30-member task  force of government security agents, carrying a warrant for the arrest of  suspected narcotics trafficker Hugo Rivero Villavicencia, raided his home. But  the team was forced to withdraw amid a gun battle with Rivero's guards and a  small army of reinforcements. Antelo said one gunman was killed and that  Astrugas Medina Villegas, believed to be in charge of security for Rivero, was  among five people arrested.  </P></p>

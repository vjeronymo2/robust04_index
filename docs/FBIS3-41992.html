By 6 February INB expects all 40 new fuel rods will be in  the plant.    Angra-1 will be undergoing its fourth fuel replacement  process, an operation that is usually made every 18 months. The  plant, which discontinued operations in 1993, will be started in  the middle of February according to the latest decision by the  directorate of Furnas, which operates the nuclear plant.    Fuel rods are assembled at INB's Fuel Elements Factory (FEC)  in Resende (Rio de Janeiro). Transportation between this city  and Angra doe Reis (Rio de Janeiro) takes approximately six  hours. During this first stage two fuel rods are being  transported in each container, in four trucks.</p>

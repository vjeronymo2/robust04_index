			<p><P> July 21, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> NLRB CALLS ON THE UNION-TRIBUNE TO ANSWER UNFAIRNESS ALLEGATIONS  </P> <P> The National Labor Relations Board has ordered a September administrative  hearing for officials of the San Diego Union-Tribune to respond to allegations  that the company has engaged in unfair labor practices in its contract  negotiations with the San Diego Newspaper Guild.  </P> <P> In a 16-page order signed by NLRB Regional Director Victoria E. Aguayo last  month, the board listed 37 specific allegations against the Union-Tribune  Publishing Co. The allegations arose from charges raised by the Guild, which  has attempted to negotiate a new contract with the company for a year.  </P> <P> An NLRB official said an administrative law judge will preside and federal  rules of evidence will apply at the hearing. Guild administrative officer  Robert Kemp called the NLRB order "an answer to the question who has been  stalling negotiations." Union-Tribune Editor-in-Chief Herbert Klein was  unavailable for comment.  </P> <P> In the order signed by Aguayo, Union-Tribune officials are alleged to have  "interfered with, restrained and coerced" Guild members. The order further  alleges that Union-Tribune officials are "discouraging membership in a labor  organization" and have "refused . . . to bargain collectively and in good  faith" with the Guild.  </P> <P> The order lists specific instances of alleged wrongdoing by the company. One  allegation, dealing with alleged violations of the grievance procedure by  Union-Tribune officials, was couched in especially harsh language.  </P> <P> According to the document, since Feb. 12, the company has been "generally  engaging in a pattern of petty harassment, obfuscation, and vituperation  calculated to substantially undermine the arbitration procedure. . . . " The  document also alleges instances in which Union-Tribune officials illegally  "conducted surveillance of employees engaged in Guild activities."  </P> <P> Some Guild employees were told that taking time off for Guild business "would  count against (them) when being considered for promotion or transfer,"  according to the allegations. The document also alleged that other employees  were told that the filing of grievances "would count against employees when  being considered for promotion or transfer."  </P> <P> About 1,000 workers at the Union-Tribune are represented by the Guild,  including reporters, librarians and employees in the circulation and  advertising departments.  </P></p>

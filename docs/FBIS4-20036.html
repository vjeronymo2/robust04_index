			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["df"-signed report: "Environmental and Social Differences </F> Must Be Accepted"]    [Text] Duesseldorf -- In a speech delivered to the IHK  [Chamber of Industry and Commerce] in Stuttgart, President Hans  Peter Stihl, president of the DIHT [Federation of German  Chambers of Industry and Commerce], welcomed the fact that GATT  has now acquired a firm institutional framework and a legal form  of governance, as well as the ability to impose its  international regulations and to punish violations. Through the  World Trade Organization (WTO), GATT regulations have finally  obtained -- GATT being a part of that organization -- the  international force of law.    The precise and binding process of settling multilateral  disputes is of particular importance within the WTO framework.  This means that threats and bilateral restrictions will no  longer have a legal basis. Stihl said: "What that means in  effect is that the law of the jungle will no longer apply in  international trade policy."    However, despite the Uruguay agreement and the establishment  of the WTO, many questions remain open, such as the links  between world trade on the one hand and aspects of  environmental, social, and competitiveness policy on the other  hand. According to the Stihl, the DIHT position is as follows:    Environmental standards naturally have a direct impact on  companies' competitiveness. Some Western countries view the  differences compared to developing countries as a blatant  distortion of competition.    Thus, this has given rise to the demand for a harmonization  of standards. Stihl: "I have doubts about whether we should  force our environmental standards, which are restrictive on  trade, on less developed trading partners. Just imagine a  country in black Africa suddenly having to introduce a clean air  or sewage charge just to be able to trade with us. That would  be absurd."    The question of minimum social standards has also recently  been linked to trade policy in countries such as the United  States, France, and southern EU [European Union] countries above  all. However, there are also some people in the FRG, for  example, in the unions and the SPD [Social Democratic Party of  Germany], who are of the opinion that German social standards  must be recommended to other countries.    According to Stihl, these other countries owe their  competitive advantages internationally to modest social  standards and the favorable cost structures that those entail.  This particularly applies to the former socialist states of  East Europe: "To want to measure their social standards  according to the criteria of our affluent society that provides  for all needs amounts to cynicism."    A further topic is the harmonization of national policy on  competition. In one country, company mergers may constitute a  violation of the law on cartels, whereas in another country,  they may receive massive support for competitive reasons.    This undoubtedly gives rise to serious distortions. However,  Stihl cannot imagine a "world cartel office" or a general,  internationally accepted law on competition. An adequate  consensus on basic rules governing the free market economy and  competition is lacking. "What does seem realistic to me is the  introduction and raising of national minimum standards and their  gradual harmonization."    The problem of harmonizing export controls remains unsolved.  The export of goods that can or could serve civilian or  military uses is subject to severe restrictions in Germany.    Other countries do not have such a mass of export controls.  Thus, foreign competition enjoys immense advantages. The FRG is  seeking harmonization within the framework of the EU.    The results that negotiations have yielded to date are  disappointing: "Everything points to a sham harmonization  allowing everyone to maintain his national standards: we will  maintain high ones and our neighbors will maintain low ones."    A further threat to world trade is posed by the fact that  the  world economy is increasingly breaking up into regional trade  zones. Since GATT came into force in 1948, over 80 preferential  regional accords have been concluded, of which very few are in  keeping with the actual provisions of the GATT treaty and  scarcely one is in keeping with its spirit.    It is estimated that by the year 2000, over half of world  trade will be conducted within preferential regional zones.  Stihl: "However, it must be ensured that if internal walls  collapse, external walls are not raised."    Stihl is very concerned about bilateralism, which is  assuming  increasingly aggressive forms in international economics. In  bilateral "managed trade," two-page agreements that can scarcely  be described as "voluntary" constitute a danger to the  international trade order. The most-favored principle is  circumvented and market shares are simply allocated and the free  market is taken out of operation.    Both the EU and the United States are to blame for that.  Just a few weeks ago, the commission in Brussels yet again  forced through an agreement with Japan on two-way automobile  exports. This has protected automakers in selected EU member  states from the rise in exports in the Japanese automobile  industry.    The United States, bolstered by the powerful protective  instruments of national trade legislation, also practice this  form of trade by government accord. It has concluded agreements  with Japan on the semicondcutor industry and recently on mobile  telephones.    If bilateral agreements cannot be avoided, then their  results  must subsequently be given a multilateral form. It would, of  course, be better if the United States and the EU were to come  up with a common policy for Japan.</p>

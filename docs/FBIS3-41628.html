			<p>Language: <F P=105> Azeri </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Azerbaijan's permanent mission to the United Nations  has conveyed an appeal by the Azerbaijan Academy of Sciences and  the Azerbaijan Committee for Supervision of Ecological  Protection and Use of Natural Resources to the UN Security  Council, UNESCO, the leading officials of organizations  responsible for the protection of the environment, the  presidents of the CIS Academies of Sciences, and the CSCE  Intergovernmental Council for Ecological Protection. It called  for halting the damage caused to Azerbaijan's plant life and  forests as a result of the Armenian occupationist war. The  appeal said:    The Transcaucasus plays an important role in the ecological  balance of the world. However, the region is faced with the  danger of destruction and ruin. The ecological balance has been  disrupted in the Transcaucasus and serious damage has been  caused to the soil structure, forests, and plant life in the  region as a result of air raids and the use of heavy artillery  and rockets in the war Armenia wages against Azerbaijan.  Several rare varieties of plants have become extinct. They  were unique to the region. In addition, rare varieties of  animals, which are also unique to the region, are threatened.    The appeal later said the following:    The rare forests in the region are being destroyed. Other  important natural resources, including forest reserves, are also  threatened. Many of the areas reserved for forests have been  turned into battlefields. Consequently, the damage Azerbaijan  has suffered totals more than $1 billion. Combat is taking  place in 260 hectares of afforested areas. The aggressors cut  down the trees and transport them to Armenia during their  military operations in those areas. The world is helpless to  protect the vitally important forests in the region, which are a  source of oxygen and fresh air. The war Armenia has been waging  against Azerbaijan has caused serious damage to our republic's  natural resources. In general, this is a serious loss for  humanity.    That behavior has been described by the convention on war  victims, the protocol added to that convention, and the 1978  convention, which condemns as an international crime military  and other measures against natural resources. Any country that  resorts to such behavior is guilty of committing a crime against  the international community and the country it attacks. In view  of that, Armenia must pay compensation for the damage it has  caused to Azerbaijan. Furthermore, in accordance with the norms  of international law, that republic must be held responsible for  repairing the damage it has caused to the region.    The appeal concluded:    That behavior, which has remained unobstructed, constitutes  a  crime not only against Azerbaijan but also against the entire  world. Therefore, we urge you to direct the necessary pressure  on the aggressor to end the war. We also urge you to bring a  court action against the aggressor. The existing situation  requires an urgent and undelayed intervention by the  international community.</p>

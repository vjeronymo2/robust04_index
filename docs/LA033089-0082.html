			<p><P> March 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIGHLAND PARK;  </P> <P> COUNCIL OKS DEVELOPMENT RESTRICTIONS  </P> <P> The Los Angeles City Council unanimously voted this week to approve an  ordinance that would severely limit development in parts of Highland Park.  </P> <P> The measure was approved without discussion, in stark contrast to the bitter  opposition that it met from small business and property owners when it was  first proposed in December.  </P> <P> If signed by Mayor Tom Bradley, the ordinance would prohibit the demolition of  buildings in most cases and limit new construction to projects deemed by city  planners to be compatible with the surrounding neighborhood. It is a temporary  measure designed to stave off development while planners revise the area's  general plan over the next few years.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Boundaries of Area  </P> <P> The ordinance covers sections of Highland Park that are part of the 1st and  14th City Council districts. The long, irregular swath is bounded by the  Pasadena Freeway and Griffin Avenue on the east, Avenue 35 on the south, Avenue  50 and Marmion Way on the west, and York Boulevard on the north.  </P> <P> Under the ordinance, city planners will review new construction projects in the  area to determine if they are consistent with the "density, scale and  character" of 75% of the existing buildings within a 300-foot radius of the  project. Under existing law, building projects in most areas of Los Angeles are  only individually reviewed if a zone change is requested.  </P> <P> The ordinance combines two measures introduced separately this fall by  Councilwoman Gloria Molina and Councilman Richard Alatorre.  </P> <P> Another interim control ordinance proposed by Alatorre this month would use  means similar to those in the Highland Park ordinance to limit development over  a much larger area -- all of northeast Los Angeles. A City Council committee  directed city planners Tuesday to draw up that ordinance and hold hearings on  it.  </P></p>

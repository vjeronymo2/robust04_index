Tietmeyer also called for a new relationship between growth  and employment, and said that social support in Europe  discouraged the creation of jobs.    Tietmeyer told the World Economic Forum here that his  unequivocal message was that there should be no experiments in  policies to combat inflation. Expansionist monetary policy  could not be used to fight unemployment, he said. There was no  alternative to rectification of structural causes of under  employment.    He also warned against sliding budget deficits in Europe,  holding that a stable monetary policy which left no room for  inflation had to be linked to budgetary policies which did not  lead later to an increase in taxation.    Tietmeyer posed the question of how to reduce the budget  deficit without bearing down unduly on demand. The problem was  how to do it at the appropriate time while being credible about  the fact that the deficit would be reduced.    Growth was necessary in dealing with unemployment, but  growth  alone was not sufficient. A new relationship between growth and  employment was needed. In European countries there were too  many encouragements to be unemployed and these should be  replaced by incitement to work.    He blamed rigidity in the labour market, a lack of  flexibility in pay rates and a system of social welfare which  discouraged the creation of jobs.</p>

			<p><P> November 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: WILSHIRE CENTER  </P> <P> In the '50s, art patron Peggy Guggenheim jokingly used to admonish sculptor  Claire Falkenstein, "Now go home and do your knitting." In fact, the artist was  painstakingly welding iron wire or bands fused with chunks of glass to create  dense, glinting sculptural webs suggestive of molecular structure and  biological growth patterns. Her affinity for fields of energy and rhythmic  patterning -- visible even in early representational drawings -- was well  suited to translating news from the world of science into tangible imagery.  </P> <P> A zingy group of works from the past 60 years by Falkenstein -- still active at  80 -- gives an idea of the breadth of her technically adventurous creations.  They range from "Fluids in Motion" (1947), a Plexiglas relief lit by  fluorescent lights, to "Predator" (1963), two tightly "knitted" enameled iron  forms that surround, and are engulfed by, a shopping cart. Falkenstein welded  slumping green glass wine jugs to metal ("Four Within a Structure"), painted on  X-ray film ("Game") and made a shaped wood painting in 1948, decades before  that approach was sanctioned by the contemporary art Establishment. When you  plug in "Planet Mars" (1962), a piece of plastic filled with mercury glows red  and yellow behind a scruffy tangle of painted iron.  </P> <P> If some of her experiments seem rather clunky and quaint today, other pieces  remain impressive. "Cellular" (1941), for which the artist made her own  double-triangle frame, offers an engrossing play of shapes transformed from  nature (a foot, a planet, an orbit), painted in a luscious medley of stinging  green, salmon, lemon and pale purple. Even "DNA Molecule" (1970-71) --  concentric networks of curving copper forms twinkling with Venetian glass -- is  hard to resist as it slowly and solemnly circles in opposing directions. It is  a tribute to the optimism and investigative energies of the American modernist  vision, of which Falkenstein remains a vigorous, witty and superbly intelligent  proponent.

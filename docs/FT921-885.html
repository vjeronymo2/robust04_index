			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: US ruling permits logging in endangered owl forests THE US Supreme Court yesterday gave victory to the US timber industry in yet another round of its protracted battle with environmentalists concerning the protection of the Northern Spotted Owl and the forests inhabited by the endangered bird in the Pacific Northwest. The court revived a 1989 federal law which barred environmental lawsuits against logging in old-growth forests in Washington and Oregon states. The 1989 law, supported by the Bush administration in an effort to protect timber industry jobs, had been struck down in 1990 as unconstitutional by the ninth circuit court of appeals in San Francisco. Yesterday's ruling may permit some 16 blocked timber sales, worth Dollars 30m (Pounds 17.3m). It will have limited impact on the issue of protecting the owl, as the 1989 bill was due to expire. Bush administration officials said yesterday they would issue a preservation plan for the spotted owl in April. They were responding to criticism from Democratic congressmen who told a House hearing that the White House had blatantly ignored laws to preserve the owl. Meanwhile, Mr Cy Jamison, director of the Bureau of Land Management, which controls large tracts of forest in Oregon, said his agency would run out of marketable timber in the west of the state by the end of the year.</p>

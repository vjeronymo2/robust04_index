			<p><P> June 1, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MRS. BUSH SINGS 'I'M A LITTLE TEAPOT TO BEWILDERED TOTS  </P> <P> Barbara Bush chose the appropriate country to break spontaneously into a  rendition of "I'm a Little Teapot," gestures and all.  </P> <P> Mrs. Bush was inspired by a colorful paper teapot thrust at her by an eager  child during the First Lady's only solo appearance in tea-loving Britain.  </P> <P> Mrs. Bush visited a day care center as well as classes in cooking, English and  fashion design during a 75-minute visit to the Lambeth Institute's Strand  Center, an adult education school. It is in Brixton, the poor south London area  hit by anti-police riots four years ago.  </P> <P> "Do you know it?" asked Mrs. Bush, as she sang the classic English nursery  rhyme about a teapot, short and stout. The First Lady shaped a spout with her  left arm.  </P> <P> British Education Secretary Kenneth Baker, who accompanied Mrs. Bush on the  outing, smiled encouragingly. The 3-year-old children, perhaps too young,  looked bewildered.  </P> <P> The school's classes, mostly in primary education, attract an average of 2,000  students a week to courses of varying length. About 65% come from "ethnic  communities," according to the Education Department.  </P></p>

			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / International Company News: Desjardins Laurentian in profit Desjardins Laurentian Financial, the financial services group controlled by the Desjardins credit union movement, reported first-quarter profits of CDollars 9.2m (USDollars 6.66m) or 18 cents a share, after a CDollars 9.5m reorganisation charge, on revenues of CDollars 983m. It was the first reporting period since the December 1993 takeover of the Laurentian Group by Desjardins to form a financial services and banking group with corporate assets of CDollars 55bn. Desjardins Laurentian, with CDollars 22bn assets, brings together life insurance, general insurance, trust operations, investment banking and consumer banking with subsidiaries in Canada, the US and Britain. It is 7.7 per cent held by La Victoire of France and its shares are publicly traded in Toronto and Montreal. Imperial Life, one of its biggest units, earned CDollars 59,000 in the first quarter after a CDollars 2.5m special charge by its British subsidiary. This compares with CDollars 5.6m a year earlier. Performance was also affected by the north American property market collapse, but overall Canadian and US operations were still profitable. Desjardins Laurentian will set aside CDollars 40m this year to cover reorganisation costs. 'The full benefits will be felt in 1996,' said Mr Humberto Santos, president. Two life units may be merged but asset sales are unlikely, he added.</p>

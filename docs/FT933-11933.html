			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Capita manages 15% advance to Pounds 2m CAPITA GROUP, a provider of services to the public sector, reported pre-tax profits up 15 per cent, from Pounds 1.77m to Pounds 2.04m, in the six months to June 30. Turnover rose to Pounds 22.1m (Pounds 13.7m) mainly because the company's outsourcing division secured ten new contracts - three to manage local authority information revenue and benefits administration, and seven in computer services - tripling the number of contracts since the last year end. Outsourcing contributed turnover of Pounds 13.2m (Pounds 7.08m) and pre-tax profits of Pounds 1m (Pounds 1.06m), giving a sharp fall in margins to 7.6 per cent (15.1 per cent). The shares closed 1p lower at 168p. Mr Rod Aldridge, chairman and chief executive, said: 'The key to the outsourcing business is creating economies of scale. Efficiency comes with growth.' The company said the new contracts had depressed margins because of the high initial costs associated with reorganising public sector structures. Capita also wrote off Pounds 300,000 in implementation costs. Analysts said they would give the company the benefit of the doubt. One said: 'It's all very plausible and this is still absolutely the business to be in. Everything now depends on effective management.' Another worry was the company's decision to move into revenue and benefits administration which some analysts said offered less scope for scale efficiencies. The advisory and consultancy division contributed Pounds 8.89m (Pounds 6.65m) to turnover and Pounds 1.04m (Pounds 703,000) to pre-tax profits, giving margins of 11.6 per cent (10.6 per cent). Capita has integrated its Pounds 450,000 cash acquisition of Goldcrest - made in April - within the property services arm of its outsourcing operations. The company estimates it contributed Pounds 203,000 to turnover and Pounds 11,000 to pre-tax profits. At the half-way stage Capita had cash of Pounds 12.3m (Pounds 7.62m) and no borrowings. Mr Aldridge said: 'A strong balance sheet is the key in our market. People want to be confident that the company they are getting into bed with for the next five years is not going to go bust.' The interim dividend is 0.85p (0.7p), payable from earnings per share of 2.86p (2.53p).</p>

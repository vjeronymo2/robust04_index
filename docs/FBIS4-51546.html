			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 30 KYODO -- To cope with the yen's  sharp advance against the U.S. dollar to a record high, Prime  Minister Tsutomu Hata's cabinet is resolved to upgrade  dollar-buying intervention in the world's currency markets in  concert with other economic powers, the cabinet's top spokesman  said Saturday [30 April].    The agreement was made at an emergency meeting of ministers  in charge of economic issues, held in the evening of the same  day after the U.S. currency plunged to a record low 100.65 yen  at one stage in New York on Friday after opening at 100.80 yen,  lower than the former record of 100.85 yen Aug. 17, 1993.    The U.S. currency recovered slightly to end the Friday  trading at 101.55-65 yen, up from Thursday's late quote of  101.35-45 yen in the wake of repeated dollar-buying intervention  by the Federal Reserve Board.    The cabinet members concurred that Japan will take  "appropriate measures at a right time" in a concerted action  with the Group of Seven (G-7) nations including the United  States to avoid volatile foreign exchange movements, Chief  Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai told a news conference after  the hurriedly called cabinet gathering.    The Bank of Japan will step into the world's currency  markets  in Hong Kong and Singapore together with New York, Frankfurt and  London as the Tokyo market opens only Monday and Friday in the  coming week for national holidays between Tuesday and Thursday,  a financial industry source said.    The source said the intervention volume by the Japanese  central bank will swell to billions of dollars one day in the  world's foreign exchanges to fight persistent market speculation  that Hata's cabinet would fail to take effective and strong  steps against the yen's surge because of its fragile political  position as a minority coalition.    "The yen's strengthening against the dollar above the 100  yen  line will give a hard hit on the economy which began to show  signs of recovery," the source said.    At the emergency cabinet meeting, the ministers also agreed  on the need to smoothly carry out a record 15.25 trillion yen  economic stimulus package unveiled in February and seek to pass  the long- overdue fiscal 1994 national budget through the Diet  as quickly as possible, Kumagai said.    The top cabinet spokesman said the ministers confirmed that  the government should come up with more concrete measures to  further open its markets by the end of June on the basis of  similar steps announced in March.    The hastily arranged meeting brought together Hata,  International Trade and Industry Minister Eijiro Hata, Koshiro  Ishida, chief of the Management and Coordination Agency, and  Yoshio Terasawa, head of the Economic Planning Agency.    Kumagai also attended the gathering on behalf of Finance  Minister Hirohisa Fujii, who left Tokyo earlier Saturday to  attend the annual conference of the Asian Development Bank to be  held in Nice, France, from Tuesday through Thursday.    The ministers shared the view that the government should  spur  the nation's sustainable growth led by domestic demand and cope  with its massive trade surplus, especially with the United  States, Kumagai said.</p>

			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / International Company News: US agribusiness groups agree joint venture terms ILLINOIS-BASED IMC Fertilizer Group and Freeport-McMoRan Resources Partners have finalised the combination of their phosphate fertiliser businesses. The joint venture, to be called IMC-Agrico company, becomes one of the largest phosphate fertiliser operations in the world, and represents about 30 per cent of US market share. The venture, first announced in January, is expected to achieve about Dollars 95m in cost savings for the two companies. Estimated sales for the company are Dollars 1bn, and combined phosphate rock capacity will be about 30m tons a year. The consolidation was driven by a long-term slump in world fertiliser prices. World prices are at 20-year lows, in part because the former states of the Soviet Union have been aggressively marketing their phosphate resources internationally. India and China have also reduced their central purchases of the commodity, and demand has been curtailed in eastern and western Europe because of economic slumps and agricultural reforms.</p>

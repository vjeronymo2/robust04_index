			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Sun Alliance reviews reinsurance policy SUN ALLIANCE, the composite insurer, is seeking to increase the level of its reinsurance protection following continuing heavy losses and a fall in its asset base and solvency. In recent years, the company, which is the best capitalised insurer in the UK, has bought less reinsurance cover than its biggest competitors, preferring to carry more insurance exposure on its own books. But Mr Scott Nelson, general manager, indicated yesterday that the policy was being reviewed following recent weather losses, claims of Pounds 42m after the IRA bombs in April, and a decline in the value of its equity and property assets. During the autumn the company would seek to reduce the limits at which its catastrophe reinsurance policies came into play. Mr Nelson warned, however, that conditions on the reinsurance market were 'very tough. We can't be confident that we will achieve what we want.' COMMENT Sun Alliance's share price shot up by 31p following its results announcement, which showed that pre-tax losses at Pounds 97.9m to be less serious than many analysts had feared. Like its competitors, the company is beginning to reap the benefits of premium increases and more selective underwriting. The fact remains though that failing any sudden turnround in the housing market, Sun Alliance's heavy exposure to the black hole of mortgage indemnity insurance will continue to depress the profitability which is emerging in most of its other businesses until at least well into next year. Moreover, Sun Alliance has invested more heavily in the UK equity and commercial property markets than any of its rivals, making it especially dependent on the fortunes of the wider economy. Potential investors would need to ask themselves whether those risks are adequately reflected in yesterday's closing price of 253p. Assuming a maintained dividend, this puts the shares on a yield of just under 8, compared to a sector average of under 7.</p>

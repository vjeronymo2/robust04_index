			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Survey of European Offshore Centres (4): Hiccups on the economic horizon - Gibraltar THE chairman of the Madrid stock market's Securities and Exchange Commission, Mr Luis Carlos Croissier, pays Gibraltar the sort of backhanded compliment that every offshore centre thirsts for. 'Lately we've been seeing Gibraltar crop up again and again,' says Mr Croissier. 'We are used to the Dutch Antilles, to the Cayman Islands and the Channel Islands but now, when we are investigating, we are also up against Gibraltar.' Never mind that the guardian of honest broking in Spain is following up allegations of dubious financial dealings conducted, in this case, by companies linked to the Kuwait Investment Office. If one, or several, of the trails leads to Gibraltar then the British crown colony on the tip of south Spain is living up to its offshore pretensions and is on a level with its peers in the secretive and tax efficient game. In Gibraltar itself, however, a lot of the brashness that was evident just a year ago seems to be evaporating. 'People were far too bullish about the offshore business,' says one well-established lawyer on the Rock. 'The business, if it is coming along at all, is not coming quick enough. There are a lot of hiccups on the economic horizon.' The main evidence of this is a Pounds 220m office complex that was developed by the Scandinavian Baltica group on land reclaimed from Gibraltar's harbour. It is virtually empty, more of a Canary Wharf look-alike at the entrance to the Mediterranean than the hive of activity that had been intended. The truth of the matter is that when Europe catches an economic cold, a place like Gibraltar risks getting pneumonia. The Rock still has a long way to go before it becomes a robust offshore centre. Baltica has written off the Europort complex and is ready to take around Pounds 50m from any group that can take the white elephant off its hands. Rather more embarrassing than the massive investment miscalculation is the fact that serious fraud investigators from the UK and Denmark have been going through the Europort books. The investigations in this case involve allegations of political bribes and scams that lead from Gibraltar to Liechtenstein. This is the sort of publicity that Gibraltar does not need. It is bad enough to have the Madrid government, which continues to press for the eventual devolution of the crown colony to Spanish sovereignty, periodically rubbishing the Rock as a centre for drugs smuggling and money laundering. Nor does the Rock need a row that has just blown up over the privatisation of the colony's companies register. Rather than pitting Gibraltar against angry investors, fraud squads and Spanish coast guards, this row has seemingly divided Gibraltar's own business community down the middle. At issue is the allegation that the privatised body, called Company House (Gibraltar) Ltd, is owned by a Liechtenstein-registered trust that will provide the working capital for registry's overdue computerisation. The colony's government, led by Chief Minister Mr Jose Bossano, 'referred to nobody (over the privatisation), tendered nothing and did everything secretively,' says an opposition member in the colony's House of Assembly. The main opposition party to Mr Bossano's government has termed the privatisation process 'entirely unacceptable'. This is in part because Liechtenstein has become a dirty word for many on the Rock ever since it emerged that the late Mr Robert Maxwell was trying to switch his Liechtenstein registered companies to Gibraltar at the time of his death. 'Revenue authorities the world over are suspicious of that place,' says Mr Christopher Samuelson of Gibraltar's Riggs Valmet asset management group. 'Liechtenstein is where you hide things, it is not the sort of base that you use for open tax planning.' Critics of the privatisation have a point when they say they cannot understand why a Liechtenstein trust should have access to the inner workings of Gibraltar's corporate life. 'How would the Isle of Man like Gibraltar to run its registry?' asks Mr Samuelson. Mr Bossano's government is also in the business firing line because it has moved in on Gibraltar's fledgling Investment and Business Development Board. Originally intended to be a joint venture between the private sector and the government, the board now looks as if it will be taken over entirely by the latter and its chief executive has resigned as a result. Those who are hostile to Mr Bossano claim the turnaround over the board is yet another example of Mr Bossano's high-handedness. The government insists, however, that it must reserve for itself the right to channel all inquiries over the Rock's development and should have all the decision-making responsibilities. The worst row, however, is one that has far more serious implications for it pitches Mr Bossano's executive against the UK government, the Treasury and the Department of Trade and Industry. Essentially it is over Gibraltar's exact status within the EC and it concerns the degree to which the UK, as the Community member that is responsible for Gibraltar before the European Court of Justice, should regulate in the colony so as the ensure the compliance of Brussels' directives. Seen from Gibraltar the prospect of UK officials running day-to-day business on the Rock is disquieting. It will, for a start, throttle the sort of local initiative that is required to search out the niche business in the highly competitive offshore sector. Mr Bossano has forcefully argued this point in London, much to the Madrid government's annoyance, and it is still not clear what sort of compromise arrangement can be worked out. Rows of one kind or another will always break out in the sort of hothouse, over-crowded community that Gibraltar has become. Exacerbating matters, intensive checking by Spanish customs officials at the colony's land frontier with Spain ensures horribly long queues and serves to fuel the tempers. Add to this the economic climate and, in the circumstances, Gibraltar does remarkably well to bring in the high quality business that it does. Hassan and Partners, a top law firm on the Rock, says it is 'very busy' at present. This is partly because it has just launched a Pounds 100m ADR (American Depositary Receipts)issue in New York on behalf of Spain's Banco Bilbao Vizcaya. This was a follow-up to a similar issue last year and a third is now likely thus demonstrating that when it comes down to money Spanish institutions tend to forget the nasty politics that envelop the Gibraltar dispute. 'At a time of recession, our units continue to grow and this shows we have a healthy banking community,' says Gibraltar's banking supervisor Mike Davidson. 'I'm reasonably happy in the current environment.' Gibraltar needs to mend fences with its own business community, with the UK and with Spain. A tall order perhaps but should it carry off such a trio of tasks and should global confidence return, developments such as the Europort complex will cease to be a disaster zone.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Ruben Mooijman and Nadia Dala: "We Are Not </F> Engaged in Politics Here; Spokesman for Milli Gorus Toning Down  Allegations About Fundamentalism"]    [Excerpts] Is the Turkish Islamic organization Milli Gorus  a hotbed of dangerous fundamentalism, as is claimed by the  Flemish Bloc? On the evening before the European Milli Gorus  congress in Antwerp, DE MORGEN spoke with Necmettin Efe, a  member of the board of the Federation of Islamic Associations,  Milli Gorus' Belgian section.    Although virtually unknown to most Belgians, Milli Gorus  (Turks for Islamic Perspective) is a very powerful organization  in the Muslim world and in Flanders. In addition, the  organization is expanding at a terrific pace. In 1976, the  Belgian Milli Gorus was formed by 16 people. Today, the  organization has 5 to 10 thousands members and supporters. "I  estimate that within a few years, half of the 85,000 Turks in  Belgium will be either members or supporters of Milli Gorus,"  Necmettin Efe says. "We have a lot of influence."  <H5>  Islam Rules </H5>   In Flemish circles, Milli Gorus is often described as a  fundamentalistic movement. Efe is not happy with that. Not  because the organization is not strictly religious, but because  the term evokes associations with, as Efe puts it, "the  troublemakers from the Mideast."    "We are no advocates of an Islamic state at all," Efe says.  "On the contrary, we do not want the state to interfere in  religion. That is why we are not in favor of so-called secular  states such as Turkey and Belgium, either. Officially, the  Church and the state are separated there, but in reality the  state controls religion. This is also true for Belgium. The  Catholics have a lot of influence in the state structure. Every  year, an average of 1,200 Belgian francs [BFr] of tax money per  citizen is appropriated for the official religions, against only  BFr10 for every Muslim."    Efe immediately seizes the opportunity to eliminate several  misconceptions. Such as the contacts with the Gray Wolves. "I  am a member of the board, and I am unaware of any such contacts.  It is sheer nonsense." An alleged move of the European  headquarters from Cologne to Antwerp? "I had to laugh about  it." Money from Saudi Arabia? "I wish it were true."    And how about the statements of the Turkish Milli Gorus  leader Necmettin Erbakan? Last year in Genk, he said that Islam  should determine the state's rule. Efe says: "Of course, I can  hardly speak for Mr. Erbakan. I agree with some of his  statements, I disagree with others. Erbakan is not familiar  with the Belgian situation, and a statement like this is  obviously not applicable to this country." [passage omitted]    Another tricky matter when it comes to Milli Gorus is  politics. In Turkey, the Refah party, the Turkish Milli Gorus'  political wing, aims at an Islamic organization of society.  "However, in Belgium we do not interfere in politics," Efe  says. "Our only political view is that we are in favor of  voting rights for migrants. An Islam party is out of the  question. This way, we would only play into the hands of the  Flemish Bloc. But I must admit that Milli Gorus did ask its  members to be as actively involved in existing political parties  as possible."</p>

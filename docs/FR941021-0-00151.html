LEO satellites' lower power levels alleviate the need for large antennas aboard the spacecraft and reduce transceiver weight and volume, enhancing their portability. By contrast, AMSC suggests that handheld transceivers are not contemplated by GSO systems. <FOOTCITE>29</FOOTCITE>  Its immediate plans do not include handheld capability, though its second generation system is expected to support them. <FOOTCITE>30</FOOTCITE>  As we embark on the promise of new mobile technologies, we find it in the public interest to permit the timely deployment of personal communications services that include the broad use of handheld transceivers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 29 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> AMSC Reply Comments at 3, n. 1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 30 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Id. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 18. One risk cited by AMSC is the increased possibility that the satellites in the LEO constellation will collide with other objects in space. We do not view this as stifling LEO technology. Both the likelihood of collisions and future mitigation methods are being discussed in domestic and international fora. However, the record in this proceeding does not support a finding that space collisions will become a significant problem for LEO systems. We also acknowledge that the reception shadowing associated with LEO satellite movement relative to the Earth's surface (which AMSC suggests would adversely affect signal quality during voice communications) may add to the operational challenges confronting LEO MSS technology. There is no showing, however, that shadowing is more of a problem with LEO technology than it is with GSO technology. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 19. Advocates of both GSO and LEO systems argue that their technology will offer economic and social benefits, domestically and globally. The essential advantage of GSO systems is their proven capability to provide telecommunication services. Intelsat and Inmarsat are but two examples. These successes, however, are not sufficient to preclude embracing a new and potentially more efficient technology, notwithstanding its substantial risks and costs. On the contrary, the Commission has a mandate to encourage new technologies and services. <FOOTCITE>31</FOOTCITE>  While both LEO and GSO systems portend substantial opportunities for employment growth and export of U.S. technologies worldwide, LEO systems have greater potential to serve more uniformly the United States and international locations with smaller, more ubiquitous and lower power equipment. This leads us to conclude that the primary use of the subject spectrum should be by LEO systems. We therefore adopt Section 25.143(b)(2)(i) as proposed in the Notice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 31 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 47 U.S.C. 157. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 20. Most commenters agree that it would be difficult for GSO and LEO systems to operate MSS services together in this band. Indeed, this was a significant factor in our decision to propose limiting the 1610&hyph;1626.5/2483.5&hyph;2500 MHz band to LEO systems Notwithstanding our decision to adopt a LEO design requirement, we would consider authorizing a GSO system in these bands upon a showing that its operations would not cause interference to or affect LEO operations. Similarly, the provision of radiodetermination satellite services (RDSS) by either LEO or GSO systems would be permissible if fully compatible with licensed LEO MSS systems. <FOOTCITE>32</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 32 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  47 CFR &sect;25.141(f). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ii. Global vs. regional coverage. 21 In our  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Notice, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  we discussed the geographic coverage we would require these satellite systems to provide. In view of our interest in furthering the creation of the global information infrastructure, we proposed to require each MSS Above 1 GHz applicant to demonstrate that its proposed system is capable of providing mobile satellite service to all areas of the world, with the exception of the polar regions, for at least 75% of every 24 hour period. Specifically, we proposed that Big LEO satellite systems be designed so that at least one satellite would be visible above the horizon at an elevation angle of at least 5 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; for at least 18 hours each day at latitudes less than 80 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;. <FOOTCITE>33</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 33 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See Notice, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  note 2,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  App. A at 1152; proposed Section 25.143(b)(2)(ii). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 22. The commenters generally support this requirement. They disagree, however, on the extent to which systems must offer service in or near the polar regions. The majority, including the system applicants, agree that there is little need for a requirement to serve unpopulated areas. They argue that the additional costs associated with such service would not be justified. For example, TRW suggests that service up to 80 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; northern and southern latitudes may not be necessary, because there are no populated areas that far north or south and the economic costs of requiring such service are high. Ellipsat favors requirements of 55 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; Southern Latitude and 75 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; degrees Northern Latitude, to cover all but the most remote population centers. The parties to the Joint Proposal modify their previous positions by suggesting a coverage requirement of up to 70 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; North Latitude and 55 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; South Latitude. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 23. As noted, LEO systems are capable of providing service to all points on Earth. We recognize, however, the need to balance system cost against geographical service area. We agree with the commenters that it is sufficient, given projected need and alternative service options, to require service only to populated areas. We therefore require that Big LEO systems be capable of serving locations as far north as 70 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; latitude and as far south as 55 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; latitude. This will allow coverage to populated areas that cannot be reached by GSO systems. While ships and airplanes may traverse the polar regions beyond these latitudes, they are not necessarily deprived of service because the LEO satellites may, in fact, be visible. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> iii. Continuous coverage of the fifty states. 24. We indicated in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Notice <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  that the public interest would be served if LEO systems provided efficient and ubiquitous voice service to users throughout the United States. We therefore proposed to require each LEO system to have at least one satellite at an elevation angle of at least 5 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; at any given time in all areas of the United States. <FOOTCITE>34</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 34 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See id.; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  proposed Section 25.143(b)(2)(iii). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

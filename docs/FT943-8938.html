			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / General denounces army plan General Alexander Lebed, the hardline commander of the Russian 14th army in Moldova, yesterday denounced plans to pull his army back into Russia and remove him from his post. He described last week's agreement between Russia and Moldova on a three-year timetable for the withdrawal as 'a crime' and said that he would not be 'an obedient performer' of Moscow's orders. Gen Lebed's outburst, just a month after he described Russian President Boris Yeltsin as 'a minus', poses an immediate threat to the delicate rapprochement between Russia and Moldova and could further undermine Moscow's control over the military, particularly units serving outside Russia's borders. Some observers fear that the charismatic general could act as a focal point for Russians who lament the collapse of the Soviet Union.</p>

			<p><P> May 4, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> OCCIDENTAL BASKETBALL JOB TAKEN BY NEWHALL  </P> <P> Brian Newhall, interim basketball coach at Occidental College last season,  confirmed Wednesday that he will accept an offer to coach the team on a  permanent basis.  </P> <P> "I'm definitely going to take it. I just need to work out the details," said  Newhall, an Occidental graduate who took over for Bill Westphal last spring.  </P> <P> Newhall, 28, served as an assistant and junior varsity coach for two years  under Westphal, who now coaches at Grand Canyon College in Phoenix.  </P> <P> Last season -- Newhall's first as a head coach -- the Tigers (15-10,5-5)  finished in a tie for third in the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic  Conference. In 1987-88, Occidental was 12-14 overall and 4-6 in conference  play, and the previous year the team finished 13-13 and 5-5.  </P> <P> David Axeen, dean of students, said that the reaction from the Occidental  community toward Newhall's performance as coach was positive.  </P> <P> "He took over in a difficult situation and not only maintained the continuity  of the team but actually made progress," Axeen said.  </P> <P> "I was very pleased to give Brian the job. He was my student and I think very  highly of him."  </P> <P> Newhall said that recruiting in the midst of the search was difficult because  he could not guarantee prospects that he would be coaching next season.  </P> <P> "You get hurt on recruiting because (the position is) being advertised all  over," he said. "It was really distracting."  </P> <P> The search committee of 10 included administrators and coaches.  </P> <P> In addition, one combined vote was given to players Chris Anderson, Stephen  Bertz, Nate Thompson and Brett Dennis.  </P> <P> Newhall's most ardent backing might have come from the players.  </P> <P> Said Anderson: "We weren't going to use it as a threat, but it was to the point  where some of us were saying if he didn't get the job we were going to go  elsewhere.  </P> <P> "There's no way, without Brian, that we would have a chance at winning. Not  with someone we don't even know and who doesn't know us."  </P> <P> Although seven players return for their senior season, Newhall will have to  fill the void left by starting guard Jason Greenstein and all-conference  forward John Keister, who averaged a team-high 23 points a game.  </P> <P> In the 1982-83 season, Newhall played point guard for the Tigers, averaged 15  points and six assists a game and was named Southern California Intercollegiate  Athletic Conference Player of the Year.  </P> <P> Occidental finished 10-2 in conference play that season -- the last year it won  a conference title.  </P></p>

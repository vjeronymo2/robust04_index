			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / Japanese Bonds: Optimists expect further discount rate cut THE PROLONGED rally in the Japanese government bond market came to a halt last week - though not for long. By Friday, with further official confirmation of the sharp slowdown of the Japanese economy, prices seemed back on their upward path. Bond market optimists were left once again looking forward to a cut in Japan's official discount rate from its current 4.5 per cent. The 15 basis point rise in the yield on the benchmark bond no 129 as the week progressed may seem too meagre to constitute a significant reversal for the market. But after a virtual one-way drive since last summer, which has seen yields plummet from 6.9 per cent last June to 5.275 per cent earlier this month, the switch in direction was a novelty. Profit-taking was blamed in part for the move, but the more significant reason was the fall in the yen, one of the casualties of the US dollar's re-emergence so far this year. Before last week, the unstoppable rise of the yen had mirrored the fall in bond yields, from Y143 to the dollar last June to around Y123 soon after the new year. But the gathering signs of confidence over the US economy helped to reverse this, pushing the dollar up to Y128 during the week. The inflationary implications of a weak yen may have knocked the steam out of the bond market, but was it an over reaction? According to Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist of DKB International in London, a rate of around Y130 to the dollar would not necessarily prove inflationary - especially with oil prices remaining soft. On this reading, the threat of imported inflation was not as severe as the market seemed to indicate. Also, many market observers predict the dollar rally has been too much, too soon: the bubble of optimism which has driven the market will not last without early signs of US recovery. By Friday night a sharp reversal wiped Y3 off the value of the dollar, thanks to disappointing industrial production figures in the US and reports of co-ordinated intervention to support the yen. The attention of the Japanese government bond market had already returned to the domestic front. Earlier, reports of comments by Bank of Japan governor Mr Yasuchi Mieno brought further confirmation the slowdown in the Japanese economy was intensifying. The market is now free to return to its familiar game of predicting the next move in the Official Discount Rate. The general view: another 0.5 percentage point cut, sometime in the spring.</p>

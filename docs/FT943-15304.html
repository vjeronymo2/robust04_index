			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Arts: All change at the Arts Council - Off the Wall The Arts Council was quietly relaunched this week. Gone is that old Arts Council of Great Britain which closed down arts organisations, cut their grants and bombarded them with bureaucracy. In its place is a new supportive, user friendly, Arts Council of England that wants all arts lovers in the country to join its campaign to persuade the government to give it a larger grant in 1995-96. The miserly frozen sum of Pounds 186m that it is currently promised, warns the council, could lead to the disappearance of some arts companies. The new secretary general, Mary Allen, speaking on behalf of the new chairman Lord Gowrie and bolstered by such fresh members at this week's Council meeting as Richard Rogers and Trevor Nunn, tore up the old strategy of picking winners and funding fewer but better arts groups, and instead promised to fight for all. As a first step the new music chairman, Gavin Henderson, has deferred the planned overhaul of the regional orchestras, so no section of the arts is currently in line for the torture chamber. The council is batting for everyone and negative talk about the minutiae of the council's distribution of subsidies to clients is to be discouraged - at least until the New Year. Mary Allen has accepted the uncomfortable reality that if the council is to make a case for a higher grant for next year it has to act now. Contrary to rumours, Lord Gowrie had not come with a dowry: speedy lobbying of the Treasury is essential. The urgency is inspired by the most quixotic of reasons. By next January the National Lottery money will start to flow into the arts at a rate of at least Pounds 100m a year, perhaps rising quickly to Pounds 200m. With all this extra funding no one is going to take seriously hard luck stories from whinging arts companies. In fact the council faces an almost impossible task in trying to persuade government and public that some arts organisations, especially the orchestras and touring drama companies without permanent homes, will still be facing horrendous financial difficulties next year. Lottery money is supposed to go towards capital projects, although the heritage minister Peter Brooke has quickly bowed to reality and allowed some grants to go towards endowments, and funding the inevitably higher running costs that follow from building improvements. This is fine for the National Theatre and the Serpentine Gallery, with capital projects in hand, but of little obvious help to transients like English Festival Ballet or the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra. The fear is that two classes of arts company will emerge; thrusting, building based organisations favoured by the booming lottery, and hard-pressed, touring performers financed by an under-funded Arts Council. Still, it is impossible to believe that if arts funding in the UK doubles next year some means will not be found to help out the genuinely needy. Millennium Fund hopefuls are falling into some rough kind of pecking order. The Royal Opera House has just received a boost, with Westminster Council finally accepting its rebuilding plans; but Albertropolis, the scheme to give London the world's leading museum city in South Kensington, has received a setback, with the Royal Albert Hall withdrawing from the project. The cost, Pounds 150m plus, was always against it, and now the RAH feels that its own renovation plan, including a pedestrianised piazza linking it with the soon to be refurbished Albert Memorial, stands more chance as a separate project. It also enables the RAH to apply to the arts lottery honey-pot, rather than the Millennium Fund, if it thinks that avenue offers a better chance of cash. Ernst &amp; Young was very happy with its Pounds 350,000 investment in the Picasso show at the Tate Gallery earlier this year. Not only did it attract a record 300,000 visitors but it also enabled the consultants to profitably wine and dine clients and contacts. So pleased were they in fact that the company is already clamouring for more. In 1996 the Tate will present the first major Cezanne exhibition for years, with around a hundred of his greatest paintings, and Ernst &amp; Young is the sponsor. It is also underwriting two smaller exhibitions, including the display next spring of architectural proposals for the conversion of the Bankside power station into the Tate museum of modern art. Every time the phone rings in the Tate's development office these days it seems to bring good news - BP is to sponsor the annual re-hangs for another two years; Reed Elsevier is supporting the major Whistler show opening in October; and Channel Four has signed up for three more years of the Turner prize. The shortlist for this most controversial of art prizes will be announced later this month and the feeling is that painters might once again be considered to be artists after years in which a sculptor or conceptualist has walked off with the Pounds 20,000. Possible names in the frame include Tony Bevan and Jenny Saville, but they might have to compete with the likes of photographer Andy Goldsworthy, sculptor Antony Gormley, and butcher's boy Damien Hirst. Brian McMasters, director of the Edinburgh Festival, is feeling schizophrenic. Ticket sales to date for the festival, which opens on August 14, are over 40 per cent higher than a year ago. But they are virtually all for music and dance events: his ambitious drama programme, built around a seven hour production by German director Peter Stein of the Oresteia, in Russian, is finding few takers. Perhaps the locals, who make up 60 per cent of the festival audience, have not quite recovered from Stein's 1993 offering - Julius Caesar in German. With the festival on course McMasters has time to patch up his continuing row with Timothy Clifford, director of the National Gallery of Scotland. Clifford wants his big summer shows, in particular the significant French painting from Monet to Cezanne, to be included in the festival, or at least in its official programme. McMasters has resisted, and instead suggested that the National Gallery takes part in an autonomous visual arts festival, incorporating all 69 Edinburgh galleries, to coincide with the main event. Clifford has gone along with the idea this year, but hardly relishes the thought of one of the leading art museums in the UK mixing regularly with some very small fish. The conflict between the two leading figures on the Edinburgh arts scene remains unresolved. But this pettiness is nothing compared to the problem facing Bill Burdett-Coutts, who at festival time runs the Assembly Rooms, far and away the biggest Edinburgh Fringe venue. This year he cannot sell tickets for the shows he is presenting at the Assembly Rooms own box office. His landlord, the City Council, insists that it only dispenses Edinburgh Festival tickets, or tickets for future Edinburgh events. So the 115,000 people who cram the Rooms each year will be directed to a separate Portakabin ticket office in one of the lanes around the back.</p>

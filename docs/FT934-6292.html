			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Government Bonds: Attention turns to German regional inflation figures The latest batch of west German regional inflation figures provided the main focus of attention for the European government bond markets yesterday as market participants were anxious to see whether they would provide the Bundesbank with an excuse to lower key interest rates next month. German government bonds ended little changed, with the release of the cost-of-living figure for the state of Hesse providing the main highlight of the day. The cost of living rose 0.3 per cent in the month to mid-November, giving a year-on-year increase of 3.8 per cent which was in line with market expectations, dealers said. The other west German states of Baden-Wurttemberg, North Rhine-Westphalia, and Bavaria are due to report their cost-of-living data over the next few days. Consumer prices for western Germany are expected to climb about 3.7 per cent in November from a year earlier, down from the October figure of 3.9 per cent. Some market participants believe this would enable the Bundesbank to cut its key Lombard and discount rates in December - in spite of the higher-than-expected money supply figures for October which came out this week. At its repo, the Bundesbank added a net DM12.2bn to the banking system. The funds were allotted at a fixed rate of 6.25 per cent, down from 6.29 per cent the previous week. Italian government bond prices bounced back again, with prices rising across the yield curve and making up for some of the ground lost earlier in the week. Dealers said long-dated bonds outperformed the short end of the market, with the 10-year yield spread over three-year bonds moving to around 30 basis points, compared with about 55-60 basis points a week ago. Traders reported some selling out of Asia Pacific yesterday, particularly in the three-to-five year area, but said some semblance of calm had been restored to the market when it appeared unlikely that approval of the 1994 budget would be jeopardised by the recent political upsets. Long-dated UK government bonds continued to benefit from the positive sentiment about the low inflation background yesterday, while short-dated issues drifted lower as investors ruled out the prospect of another interest rate cut in the immediate future. After the excitement of Tuesday's half-point cut in the base rate - which prompted a flurry of activity - the gilt market experienced a somewhat calmer trading session yesterday. Short-dated stocks closed about  1/8 point lower while long-dated issues gained nearly  1/4 point, helped by extension trades. The moves resulted in a flattening of the gilt yield curve. US Treasury prices ended little changed in light trading yesterday in the wake of some mixed economic news. The benchmark 30-year government bond closed  1/16 higher at 99 7/32 , yielding 6.303 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was unchanged at 100 3/32 , to yield 4.184 per cent. After Tuesday's big rally, investors and dealers set about consolidating their gains from the opening. There was some nervousness that a round of strong economic data would spark off fresh selling, but fortunately yesterday's news on the economy was not consistent enough to drive the market lower. Although durable goods orders rose 2.0 per cent in October - the third consecutive monthly gain - weekly jobless claims came in weaker than expected, and the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index showed a decline from 82.7 in October to 81.2 in November. Japanese government bond prices ended mixed with the yield curve steepening sharply in the four to 10-year area. Continued weakness in the Japanese stock market helped to support prices at the short end of the bond market. Money market prices edged lower as yesterday's fall in share prices once again revived hopes that the Bank of Japan will cut interest rates.</p>

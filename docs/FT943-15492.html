			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Demerger hints lift Thorn Leisure to electronics group Thorn EMI was one of the FT-SE 100's best performers as the market picked up hints of a bullish trading statement at Thorn's annual meeting next week. News of further disposals from the group's defence activities is also expected. The market was also said to be increasingly optimistic about the chances of demerger for the company's two core businesses, music and rental. That move would almost certainly see Thorn shares accelerate as the market focused on the intrinsic value of its premium music production and publishing operations. There have been strong rumours that the Thorn board is poised to discuss a potential demerger which, the market believes, could be completed before mid-1995. Henderson Crosthwaite, the agency broker, was a large buyer of Thorn EMI stock yes-terday. Mr Brian Newman at Henderson puts a break-up value on Thorn EMI of between 1340p to 1420p and described the shares as a 'strong buy'. At the close of business, Thorn EMI shares were 28 higher at 1,026p. Turnover was a hefty 2.1m.</p>

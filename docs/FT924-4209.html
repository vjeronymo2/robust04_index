			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Mountview shows marginal growth to Pounds 3.6m MOUNTVIEW Estates, the property dealing group, reported a modest 2 per cent increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 3.54m to Pounds 3.62m in the half year to September 30, as higher rental income offset its exposure to the depressed south-east property market. Turnover improved to Pounds 7.31m (Pounds 6.89m). In spite of higher earnings per share of 52.8p (51.7p), the Mountview board believed any increase in the interim dividend would be 'injudicious in the uncertain economic climate' and is holding the pay-out at 8p. Mr Duncan Sinclair, chairman, said trading income was flat, but rental revenue more than twice covered the company's administrative costs and finance charges. Mr Sinclair said the availability of repossessed homes was 'the most depressing factor' on the market, and it would take time before lower interest rates had an impact in improving market conditions.</p>

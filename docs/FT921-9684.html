			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Letter: Hopes for enhancing the security of pensions Sir, In your leader, 'Maxwell's pensions' (February 7), you say that 'the pensions lobby' would argue against the principle of pension rights ranking as secured creditors when the sponsoring business fails, because it does not regard final salary pensions as deferred pay. The assertion confuses two issues. Few people would argue with the principle that the value of accrued pensions rights - the members' stake in the fund as you put it - could be described as deferred remuneration, but that does not in itself resolve the complex question of the ownership of surplus assets in balance of cost schemes. As far as the ranking of pension rights in a liquidation or receivership is concerned, even fewer would argue against the case for further enhancing the overall security of members' retirement provision in occupational pension schemes. In fact, it is to be hoped that such a change in legislation may be one positive development which may emerge from the disastrous consequences of the Maxwell case.

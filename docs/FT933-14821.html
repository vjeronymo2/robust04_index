			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Germany's man at EBRD not quitting MR MANFRED ABELEIN, German vice-president on the board of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, yesterday denied that Bonn was about to replace him because of business dealings in east Germany. The German finance minister, Mr Theo Waigel, also rejected a report in Der Spiegel, that he and Chancellor Helmut Kohl had decided to replace him at the bank, whose president, Mr Jacques Attali, quit two weeks ago. Mr Abelein issued a statement that his activities on behalf of the east German car manufacturer, SAZ - the state enterprise which produced the Trabant - preceded his appointment as a director of the bank. He denied having had any second job while working at the bank. He was involved at SAZ as a legal adviser for the sale of its drive-shaft works, eventually bought by Britain's GKN. Subsequently, Mr Abelein, for 25 years a Christian Democrat MP and a close colleague of Mr Kohl, became a member, and then chairman, of the SAZ supervisory board. Der Spiegel claims Mr Abelein and a business partner, Mr Werner Frantz, submitted a bill for their activities on behalf of the company totalling more than DM6.5m, (Pounds 2.55m) based on an estimated value of the drive-shaft works of DM203m. It says the bill was questioned by SAZ management, and reduced by over DM2m. Mr Abelein said his fees had been investigated by a neutral source at his request, and an agreement reached with the Treuhand privatisation agency on an agreed sum. He gave up his position as chairman of the SAZ supervisory board at the end of 1992. Philip Stephens, Political Editor, adds: The British Treasury last night declined to damp speculation that Mr John Major is set to propose Lord Lawson, the former chancellor, to replace Mr Attali.</p>

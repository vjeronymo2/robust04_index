			<p>BFN     [Text] The House of Representatives held a session this  morning under the speakership of brother Shaykh 'Abdallah  Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar and in the presence of Foreign Minister  Muhammad Salim Basindwah. The foreign minister explained to the  House the actions taken by brother Engineer Haydar Abu-Bakr  al-'Attas, the prime minister, on his medical and tourist trip,  as well as his contacts and telephone conversations abroad with  Arab and other officials. These contacts included the Arab  League secretary general, the UN secretary general, certain  Yemeni ambassadors, and our Arab League permanent  representative. The foreign minister explained that al-'Attas  exploited his position as prime minister by holding these  contacts and asking for an Arab League peace-keeping force, thus  allowing for the violation of our national sovereignty and  national independence, when what is taking place in our country  is no more than a war against those who have rebelled against  constitutional legitimacy and democracy.    The foreign minister added that the advent of foreign troops  to our country would undermine the sovereignty and independence  of the country. He indicated that brother Haydar Abu-Bakr  al-'Attas is exploiting his position as prime minister in a  manner that does not serve the homeland as much as it serves a  party faction. Moreover, our Arab League permanent  representative has called for peacekeeping forces without  obtaining the Council of Ministers' approval, but at the request  of brother Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, who has not received the  approval of the Council of Ministers or the Foreign Ministry.  Had our permanent representative believed in the homeland's  interest, he would not have received his instructions from the  prime minister, who is on a tourist trip abroad.    The brother foreign minister said the Arab League Council --  thanks to our national, candid, clear, and firm stand -- was  satisfied with the adoption of a decision, whose most important  point was the Arab League Council's reaffirmation of the  statement it issued in March supporting Yemeni unity without  reservation.    The House then discussed in detail the illegitimate foreign  moves and activities of the brother prime minister, who is  abroad on a medical trip. The House members approved the  following House draft resolution:    In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate.    Resolution by the House of Representatives:    During its session today, Monday, 29 Dhu al-Qi'dah 1414  Hegira, corresponding to 9 May 1994, the House of  Representatives discussed the moves and contacts made by brother  Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, the prime minister, and the political  activities accompanying them in his official capacity as prime  minister although he traveled for medical purposes and was not  assigned with any official mission by the Presidential Council  or the Council of Ministers. Since his talks, contacts, and  statements deal with domestic Yemeni affairs and violate Article  110 of the Constitution of the Republic of Yemen, which states  that the role of the chairman of the Council of Ministers is  confined to implementing the Council of Ministers' decisions and  the state's general policy in a coordinated and unified manner;  and in view of what is entailed by these contacts and moves in  terms of negative repercussions that are detrimental to the  sovereignty, independence, and supreme interests of Yemen, the  House has decided the following:    1. His contacts and statements are totally null and void due  to their violation of constitutional legitimacy in accordance  with Article 110 of the Constitution of the Republic of Yemen.  Moreover, any contacts or moves outside the framework of the  constitutional institutions by any official or politician in the  state are considered null and void and entail no legal  commitment whatsoever.    2. The executive authority should implement the House  resolution, communicate it to other states and international  bodies and organizations, and adopt the necessary measures in  accordance with the Constitution. May God grant us success.    Brother Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam Khalid Karman, minister of legal  and House of Representatives affairs, attended today's session.</p>

The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> I.

AUTOM is an electronic delivery system of small options orders to the Phlx trading floor, with an automatic execution feature. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The original proposal included a request for permanent approval of AUTOM. Because the Phlx is in the process of modifying and upgrading the computer system on which the AUTOM system operates, the Phlx submitted a letter, dated December 17, 1993, withdrawing that request from the proposal (``Amendment No. 1''). The Phlx states that it will resubmit its request for permanent approval after the Phlx and the Commission have had the opportunity to evaluate the operation of the system in light of the current modifications and upgrades. See letter from J. Keith Kessel, Staff Counsel, Phlx, to Richard L. Zack, Branch Chief, Division of Market Regulation, Commission, dated December 17, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II.

The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On March 31, 1988, the Commission approved the establishment of AUTOM as a pilot program. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  The Exchange currently is proposing to extend the AUTOM pilot program until December 31, 1994. The Exchange represents that, from the date of the last Commission order extending the AUTOM pilot program, AUTOM has operated efficiently and without any material problems being reported by Phlx members or AUTOM users. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission approved AUTOM on a pilot basis for market orders of up to five contracts for all exercise prices in the near month covering twelve Phlx equity options.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Securities Exchange Act Release No. 25540 (March 31, 1988), 53 FR 11390 (April 6, 1988). Since then, the order routing feature of AUTOM has been expanded to include all orders in all exercise prices and months in all Phlx equity options. In addition, day orders, good until cancelled orders, and cabinet orders (accommodation transactions) have become eligible for delivery through the system, and the eligible order size for the order routing feature of AUTOM has been increased from five to one hundred contracts. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 28643 (November 26, 1990), 55 FR 49960 (December 3, 1990) at notes 2&hyph;6 for citations to Commission orders approving these expansions of the AUTOM pilot. See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> also <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Securities Exchange Act Release No. 28978 (March 15, 1991), 56 FR 12050 (March 21, 1991). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The AUTOM system is an online system that allows electronic delivery of options orders from member firms directly to the appropriate specialist on the Phlx options trading floor, with electronic confirmation of order executions. Specifically, once AUTOM orders are entered into the system and routed to the specialists' post, they are executed manually by the specialist who, upon execution of the order, enters the relevant trade information into the system. An execution report is then automatically transmitted to the firm that placed the order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The AUTOM system also has an automatic execution feature called ``Auto-X.'' Currently, Auto-X is available to public customer market and marketable limit orders of up to 20 contracts. Orders eligible for automatic execution through AUTOM are: (1) Printed in hard copy form at the floor representative booth of the delivering member organization; (2) displayed on the trading crowd screen with buy/sell information omitted; and (3) printed in hard copy form at the specialist post. The order is priced and executed automatically at the best displayed bid or offer, and the execution is reported automatically to the Options Price Reporting Authority (``OPRA''). A report of the execution also is electronically sent to the delivering member organization. Under Auto-X, the specialist is the contra-side of all trades. However, the specialist is required to ensure participation of bids and offers on the limit order book and in the trading crowd that are entitled to execution pursuant to the Phlx's rules of priority, parity, and precedence.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

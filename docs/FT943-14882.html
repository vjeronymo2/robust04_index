			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Survey of World Automotive Components (5): A mark of respect for German supplier - Profile of Robert Bosch German-based Robert Bosch topped the list of automotive component suppliers in the recent Financial Times/Price Waterhouse survey on Europe's most respected companies. It was second overall in the Automobiles/Auto Trucks and Parts category, headed only by its compatriot BMW. Perhaps this recognition for excellence among its competitors provides some consolation for recent trading conditions which, by any standards, have been exceedingly tough. They could hardly have been otherwise in the context of sharp declines in European vehicle production. In the company's all-important German market, for example, car production fell by 23 per cent in 1993 and commercial vehicle output by 28 per cent. Latest financial results highlight the damage caused, with total group turnover in 1993 falling by 5.7 per cent to DM32.5bn. Net income was down for the fourth consecutive year and, at DM426m, showed a decline of 16.8 per cent compared with the previous year and stood at its lowest level since 1985. Capping the gloom, the company incurred an operating loss for the year, although the figure has not been revealed. Although Bosch manufactures a wide range of consumer and industrial products, automotive equipment is easily the largest business sector, accounting for 49.7 per cent (DM16.2bn) of group sales in 1993. This makes the company the world's largest independent supplier of automotive components and systems, and Bosch technology can be found on the products of every leading vehicle producer. There are nine main automotive divisions producing a wide range of components and systems. Many fall into the category of traditional items such as starters, alternators, sparking plugs, head lamps and windscreen washers. But Bosch has also established a reputation for producing technically advanced products for vehicle safety, security, performance, comfort and fuel efficiency. With regard to safety, the company was the first to produce ABS (anti-lock braking systems), traction control and triggering devices for occupant restraint systems for the motor industry. On the security front, Bosch is supplying factory-fitted electronic immobilisers to prevent unauthorised starting - a feature which is expected to become standard equipment on cars in the near future. Meanwhile, the unique Blaupunkt 'KeyCard' solution to car theft from Bosch's audio division has produced impressive results. KeyCard-equipped radios account for 5 per cent of the German market, but for just 0.4 per cent of the units stolen. Improvements to vehicle economy and performance are achieved through diesel and petrol fuel injection, transistorised ignition, engine management systems and electronic gearbox controls. The company is also in the forefront of developing systems to promote cleaner emissions. Although the company has an extensive international presence with subsidiaries, affiliates or agencies in 125 countries and more than 70 foreign-based production facilities, 51 per cent of sales are made in Germany and around 85 per cent in Europe. Of the remainder, the Americas account for 12 per cent, which means that exposure to the fast developing south-east Asia motor industry is as yet limited. One of the most successful foreign ventures is the UK manufacturing facility, located near Cardiff, where compact alternators are manufactured. The plant was opened in 1991 and at the time represented Bosch's largest single foreign investment. Cumulative output recently passed the 5m level. As well as supplying UK vehicle assembly operations there is a sizable export trade to continental Europe, America and Japan - sufficient to propel Bosch into the Top 100 list of UK exporters. There is a high priority on research and development. Of the group's 156,000 employees worldwide, about 12,000 are scientists, engineers and technicians involved in improving the functionality and reliability of existing products and developing new ones. In 1993, Bosch allocated more than DM2.2bn to R &amp; D, the same level as in the previous year and equal to 6.8 per cent of sales. In the face of falling turnover, therefore, Bosch has maintained its R &amp; D momentum. Several examples indicate the type of products which Bosch will supply for tomorrow's vehicles. In headlights, the company has developed a system which uses cherry stone-sized gas discharge lamps to produce twice the amount of light of conventional units together with improved range and width of illumination. An electrical fuel pump has been developed which is 45 per cent lighter and 30 per cent smaller than previous designs. And an electronic wiper system is under development which will eliminate the need for the driver to operate windscreen wipers manually. Early in 1994, Bosch announced details of its latest ABS which contains both the hydraulic and electronic components in a single assembly. As well as being more compact and weighing less - crucial characteristics as vehicle makers attempt to make their products more fuel efficient - the new system also offers significant cost savings and will hasten the day when ABS is a standard fixture. The company differs from global competitors insofar as about 92 per cent of its equity is owned by the Robert Bosch Foundation, which is charged with ensuring that the company's assets are administered for public benefit purposes. This means that the dividends received are donated to charitable causes. While this status does not mean, of course, that there is no pressure to secure satisfactory financial returns, the company undoubtedly enjoys the luxury of not having to satisfy an outside group of hungry investors on a quarterly or half yearly basis, as is the case with the principal American and British component groups. This has provided the necessary conditions to focus on long-term targets - notably in R &amp; D - an especially valuable characteristic during the recent downturn. Perhaps this freedom is Bosch's greatest asset.</p>

			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / Election boost to housing market reported HOUSEBUILDERS and estate agents say there has been a modest improvement in interest from prospective house buyers since the Conservative general election victory. Some agents report that the number of people visiting show houses and other properties for sale rose by up to 20 per cent over the two weekends since polling day, compared with the weekend prior to April 9. This period included Easter weekend when sales are usually higher. Estate agents, nonetheless, said they were encouraged by the rise in interest. Mrs Sandy Pearce, sales manager of south London estate agents Linay &amp; Shipp, said the outcome of the election 'was the right result for the property market'. She added: 'House buyers had been worried about the impact a Labour government might have on taxation and interest rates. That uncertainty has been removed and confidence among prospective buyers has risen. I am very encouraged.' Mr John Evans of the Nationwide estate agency in Chester also believed that the Tory victory had given a fillip to the housing market. 'People who had been sitting on the fence and delaying exchanging contracts have in the past two weeks decided finally to go ahead and take the plunge,' he said. Estate agents were, however, reluctant to talk of the possibility of a sustained recovery. They said that sales had staged a similar improvement last year after the Gulf war only to fall sharply again as summer approached. Mr Andrew Spittle, a partner of James &amp; Lister Lea in West Midlands, said prices were still falling in some instances and would remain under pressure while there was such a backlog of unsold properties on the market. He said that interest from buyers had risen since the beginning of this year and had improved further since the election, but that there was still a lot of slack in the market. Housebuilders also remained cautious. Mr Duncan Davidson, chairman of Persimmon, a builder based in the north of England, said the company had made a solid start to the year which was continuing. But it was too early to say whether the outcome of the election would lead to a longer term improvement. Mr Richard Fraser, chairman and chief executive of Westbury, the Cheltenham-based building group, said: 'We are encouraged by the performance since the election and over Easter which has gone slightly better than we expected.' Mr David Holland, chief executive of Wimpey Homes, the UK's second-largest housebuilder, said: 'Our sales this year have been running about 10 per cent above the corresponding period last year. There was a fall-off during the run-up to the election, but sales have picked up again since polling day.'</p>

			<p><P> December 12, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> OFFICERS PRESS HUNT FOR KIDNAP-SLAYERS  </P> <P> Santa Ana police and Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies on Tuesday pressed  their investigations into the kidnaping of two Santa Ana men who were robbed  and then driven to Malibu, where one was fatally shot.  </P> <P> Authorities declined Tuesday to release the names of the victims. They said new  information on the case may be released today.  </P> <P> The abductions occurred about 10:30 p.m. Sunday night when the victims were  taken from a Santa Ana bar at gunpoint and robbed of their wallets and gold  jewelry, according to Sgt. Tom Pitkin, watch commander for the Malibu station  of the Sheriff's Department.  </P> <P> After driving the victims around for more than three hours, the kidnapers took  them to a point on Decker Road about a quarter-mile north of Pacific Coast  Highway, made them get out of the car and kneel by the side of the road, Pitkin  said.  </P> <P> One of the victims was then shot once in the back of the head at close range.  </P> <P> "It was an execution," Pitkin said. "It blew out the back of his head. When the  survivor saw them execute his friend, he just bailed out and headed down the  hill."  </P> <P> The survivor, who apparently eluded his captors for about four hours in the  dense brush, was described as a Salvadoran national between the ages of 25 and  30.  </P> <P> Decker Road, in the area where he made his escape, is one of the steepest and  most remote roads in the Malibu area, Pitkin said.  </P> <P> The survivor waited until daylight Monday and then flagged down a passing  motorist.  </P> <P> Since the shooting, Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies and investigators  from the Santa Ana Police Department have uncovered few clues that they will  discuss publicly but have run onto many unanswered questions.  </P> <P> "This begs the question: If they were just going to rob them, why drive all  that way?" asked one officer, who asked not to be identified. "And why kill  them over a robbery? I would suspect they were looking for more than just what  these (victims) had on them."  </P> <P> Police do not know what type of gun was used, and the only clue left at the  scene was a pair of surgical gloves, apparently used to prevent fingerprints  from being left behind, Pitkin said.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Allison Samuels contributed to this report.  </P></p>

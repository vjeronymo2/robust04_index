The delegations were led by Czech Industry and Trade  Minister  Vladimir Dlouhy, Hungarian Minister for International Economic  Relations Bela Kadar, Polish Minister for Foreign Economic  Cooperation Leslaw Podkanski and Slovak Economic Minister Jan  Ducky.    The introductory evaluation of the Central European Free  Trade Association's [CEFTA] agreement, for the short time which  it has been in force, confirmed that the mechanism was effective  in its support of the aims of the contracting parties, and was  thus contributing to the development of international trade and  the world economy. The report announced the near completion of  the negotiations which had been taking place in the last few  months on the further lowering of tariffs and other obstructions  for industrial products and the extending of concessions for  agricultural products, in the interest of the continuing  liberalisation of trade. During today's meeting, ministers  expressed willingness to continue in attempts to also remove the  remaining tariff and non-tariff obstructions to trade, including  obstructions in the agricultural sector.    The delegations firmly believe that by the end of 1997 a  free-trade zone will be formed for the 65 million inhabitants of  the CEFTA countries. The CEFTA agreement was a good example for  the liberalisation of trade, the ministers said, adding that  they welcomed the process of negotiation and implementation of  bilateral agreements on free trade between the individual CEFTA  countries and third countries.    Association agreements with the European Union, as well as  the agreements on free trade with the European Free Trade  Association (EFTA) were the basic means by which the  obstructions to a considerable amount of trade would be blown  away in a relatively short time, and were important milestones  in the integration process of CEFTA countries into international  trade, the ministers said. They expressed the hope that in the  future no measures with protectionist elements would be passed,  such as anti-dumping measures, if these were not fully justified.    As far as the results of the Copenhagen summit of the  European Community were concerned, the ministers praised the  additional trade concessions offered to the CEFTA countries,  although they also said they expected the European Union to  extend the trade concessions further.    The ministers praised the individual and joint initiatives  and the measures approved by the Organisation for European  Cooperation and Development (OECD) which improved the  accessibility of their markets to goods from CEFTA countries.  They said they also believed that the very sober appliance of  protective measures was of great importance for the maintenance  of the dynamics of development, the integration of national  economies and the liberalisation of trade within the CEFTA  agreement. The ministers also expressed their great pleasure at  the declared interest of the United States to further liberalise  trade with the CEFTA countries, adding that during further  negotiations with the United States they expected to be able to  improve conditions for access to U.S. markets. The CEFTA  agreement countries expressed satisfaction at the successful end  to the Uruguay Round of GATT talks, whose results represented an  important step in the direction of the further liberalisation of  goods and services. Confidence in the international trade  system had been increased by the agreement concerning the  establishment of the World Trade Organisation, the ministers  said.</p>

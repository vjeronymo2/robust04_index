			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOOD;  </P> <P> HEALTH FARE;  </P> <P> A PRIMAVERA OF WHOLE-WHEAT PASTA AND FRESH VEGETABLES  </P> <P> When the weather warms up, garden-fresh vegetables and whole-grain products  begin to sound especially appealing. "Summer is a great time to get into  high-fiber foods," says Cheryl Hyman, nutrition consultant and spokesperson for  the California Dietetic Assn. "Abundance makes for a lot of choices, and the  pairing of vegetables with foods such as whole-wheat pasta is a lot more  appetizing than a bowl of oat bran."  </P> <P> Inspired by classic Italian pasta primavera, the dish shown here combines  slivers of zucchini, onion and yellow peppers with whole-wheat spaghetti.  "Traditional Italian food is very health conscious," adds Nicholas, executive  chef of Pane Caldo in West Hollywood. "More and more, people order dishes with  no oil, no butter. Upon request, we'll reduce the butter and leave out the  salt, using herbs and a good olive oil as a substitute," he continues. Low in  fat and high in carbohydrates, this pasta combination pairs nicely with a  clean, intensely flavored fresh pea-and-watercress soup drizzled with a little  tasty -- but, alas, cholesterol-rich -- sour cream.  </P> <P> ZUCCHINI AND ONION WITH WHOLE-WHEAT PASTA  </P> <P> 1 1/2 pounds zucchini, seeded  </P> <P> 1/4 cup olive oil  </P> <P> 2 medium red onions, halved and thinly sliced  </P> <P> 1 yellow pepper, seeded and thinly sliced  </P> <P> 1/4 cup wine vinegar  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons water  </P> <P> 6 whole cloves  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon fennel seeds  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon fresh oregano leaves  </P> <P> 1/2 cup fresh basil leaves  </P> <P> 1 pound whole-wheat spaghetti  </P> <P> Salt, pepper  </P> <P> Freshly grated Parmesan cheese  </P> <P> Cut zucchini into 1/4-inch-thick strips 2 to 3 inches long. Heat 2 tablespoons  olive oil in skillet and saute zucchini over medium-low heat until tender but  still crisp. If necessary, add more oil to prevent burning. Transfer zucchini  and remaining oil in pan to shallow baking dish.  </P> <P> Add olive oil to skillet, add onions and yellow pepper strips and cook,  stirring, over medium heat until softened, about 3 minutes. Add onions and  their juices and yellow pepper strips to zucchini, tossing lightly to mix.  </P> <P> In small saucepan, combine vinegar, water, cloves and fennel seeds. Bring to  boil, reduce heat and simmer 3 minutes. Pour over zucchini and onion mixture.  Add oregano and basil leaves, cover tightly and marinate at least 1 hour.  </P> <P> Just before serving, cook pasta in boiling salted water until tender. Drain and  turn into greased serving dish. Drain zucchini and onions, reserving marinade.  Add zucchini mixture to pasta and toss gently. Add reserved marinade to taste  and season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve grated Parmesan over each  portion. Makes 4 to 5 servings.  </P> <P> NOTE: For variety, different vegetables may be substituted for the zucchini and  yellow pepper. Some suggestions are julienned yellow squash, red and green  pepper strips, julienned carrot.  </P> <P> FRESH PEA SOUP  </P> <P> 1 cup sliced green onions, green part only  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons butter or margarine  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons flour  </P> <P> 1 quart clear chicken broth  </P> <P> 1 small potato, peeled and diced  </P> <P> 3 cups fresh shelled peas or 2 (10-ounce) packages frozen peas  </P> <P> 1 cup watercress leaves, not packed  </P> <P> Salt, white pepper  </P> <P> 1/4 to 1/2 cup sour cream or creme fraiche, if desired  </P> <P> Additional watercress sprigs for garnish  </P> <P> Saute green onions in butter until limp and tender, about 2 minutes in heavy  saucepan. Gradually add flour and cook, stirring, for about 1 minute. Add  broth, cooking over medium heat until mixture thickens slightly. Add potato,  peas and watercress, cover and simmer for 20 minutes or until vegetables are  tender.  </P> <P> Remove from heat and puree until smooth in blender container in several  batches. Return to pan, heat through and season to taste with salt and white  pepper. (If soup is too thick, additional chicken broth may be added to thin  slightly.) To serve, drizzle sour cream or creme fraiche in each bowl. Makes  about 6 servings.  </P> <P> Photographed by Myron Beck; produced by Robin Tucker; food styling: Stephanie  Puddy; tableware: Tesoro, Los Angeles  </P></p>

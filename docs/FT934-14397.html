			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Travel Focus - Caribbean &amp; South America: Relax: it's just a pelican crossing - James Henderson enjoys the lazy lifestyle on undisturbed Barbuda BARBUDA is a little-known coral outcrop, lost, as its name suggests, somewhere between Barbados and Bermuda. Barbuda is a sister island to Antigua and lies some 30 miles to its north. It is mostly scrub and a few superb, incredibly long beaches (there is so much sand that Barbuda actually exports it); and a couple of incongruously smart and expensive hotels. The island's highest point is 120ft, jokingly referred to as the Highlands by the 900 locals. Over the centuries development has bypassed Barbuda. For many years it was a private farm rented from the British king at an annual rent of 'one fat sheep, if demanded.' In fact, were it not for the abandoned cars all over the place (a common feature of Caribbean islands), most of Barbuda would be recognisable to the American Indians who lived there 500 years ago. The Amerindians - the first Caribbean island-hoppers - certainly stole a march on 20th century travellers. They lived within the rhythms of nature, enjoying the benign climate, spending much of their time in hammocks, fishing as need be and grilling their catch over open fires on the beach. The Amerindian idyll can still be found in Barbuda, but you must be prepared to pay a thoroughly 20th century price. Both the main hotels charge about Dollars 1,000 (about Pounds 660) a night for two. After my arrival, I took a bumpy ride along the island's only road. Like so many West Indian roads it was pitted and pot-holed; the traffic simply swings left and right through the path of least resistance. Suddenly we emerged into the calm, manicured environs of the K Club. Either side of its breezy white main house, the K Club has about 20 villas strung out along one of the Caribbean's finest beaches - about five miles of it. The K Club is the chic design child of Milanese fashion empress Mariuccia Marinelli, known in the trade as Krizia. Krizia's symbol, a simple K in the world of fashion, has sprouted palm fronds on its left-hand stalk in the tropics and this logo appears all over the club, on plates, pens and on the bottom of the pool. As you would expect, the K Club has real style. With an acreage of white wood and tiles, offset with jade fittings, it appears effortlessly simple, but the simplicity is cleverly crafted. The design takes old Caribbean themes like louvred windows, wicker furniture and gently-sloping roofs and turns them to 20th century comfort. Fans overhead whip up the tropical heat; even the showers have a view, through the garden to the sea. The flight from Europe, following the sun across the Atlantic, helps you relax into the rhythms of tropical life. After a long day's travelling you flake out early in the evening, but then you wake with the sun (about 9am UK time), and dawn is perhaps the best part of the Caribbean day. The air is fresh and calm. Even the noises are different, unaffected by the midday heat. I walked the whole beach on the first morning in a slightly surreal state of mind after a heavy sleep, testing the sand between my toes. Ahead of me was a little band of sandpipers trotting along, dodging the frothy fingers of the breaking waves. Breakfast was served on the veranda and I watched the gathering blue of the sea; it strengthened steadily to turquoise as the sun climbed slowly higher and higher. There is little to do on Barbuda. I found myself reclining, happy to watch the beach. It is still a living beach. Seven pelicans make it their beat, sometimes arriving in formation, at other times cruising in alone, then wheeling like a bomber on outstretched wings and dropping with a distant flump in the water. High above them is the occasional dark streak of a frigatebird. These scissor-tailed birds are magnificent creatures. They have 6ft wingspans and can fly at 100mph. Only when they are mating are they not so sleek; males display ridiculously unwieldy scarlet pouches the size of a football on their gullets. Their nest on Barbuda can be visited easily. Snorkelling is also a great pleasure on an island as undisturbed as Barbuda. You don't need to dive here because the best of the corals are so close to the surface. The reefs shimmer with thousands of tiny silvery fish, all facing into the current and twitching in unison. Swim among them and they scatter in momentary chaos, but soon they come back into line and the cloud re-forms around you. Elsewhere angel fish swim singly and in pairs, coloured a luxurious deep blue, like velvet; rock beauties loiter around the corals, pouting; lobsters lie in little stacks in their crevices. It comes as a bit of a surprise to find that there is a hotel bang next door to the K Club (well, a couple of miles down the beach, to be fair). Even more surprising, it has been there about 30 years. Coco Point Lodge has a magnificent setting in a coconut garden, on a tapering spit of land rimmed with very fine sand. The sunset view takes in a string of islands from Antigua to Nevis. It is very exclusive and it now sees generations of returning visitors. Newcomers may not get in. Walk-in writers get short shrift. The story runs that Krizia herself was refused entry and so she decided to build her own hotel. Certainly the owner of Coco Point did not go a bundle on the K Club. Guests there are not allowed to use his private airstrip. There are few places around the Caribbean that I haven't managed to talk my way in to. But it is surprising what you can see from below the high-water mark if you use a long lens. Coco Point is clearly smart. Some of the older rooms look small but there are some superb villas, very finely decorated, overlooking an expanse of sumptuous, golden sand. James Henderson flew with BWIA, which operates twice-weekly flights to Antigua from Heathrow. Current return fares: Pounds 804-Pounds 3,490. From Antigua connections can be made to Barbuda on LIAT or the K Club's private aircraft. It is possible to visit the K Club for the day from Antigua (tel: 809-460-0300, fax: 460-0305).</p>

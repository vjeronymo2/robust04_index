			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "NTV" newscast] </F>   [Text] Ground units have successfully participated in the  Moncada exercise held by the Western Army. Missile attacks were  launched against a landing enemy force. The combat alert did not  take the Orden Antonio Maceo Naval Base by surprise. The units  deployed and quickly occupied combat positions. The mock battle  against some 20 enemy ships only required the use of 50 percent  of our forces.    The initial missile attack was launched against the landing  boats. Our infantrymen acted calmly and with dedication to  attain, in peace, the adroitness war demands. At a speed of over  30 knots, a missile boat launched its weapons and returned  victorious from its mission.    The Western Army Moncada exercise demonstrated today that  the  Cuban Revolutionary Navy maintains a high combat readiness and  its troops are also a fist of steel against the enemy. This is  why it has retained seven years in a row, the Revolutionary  Armed Forces's Top Forward Unit status.</p>

			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / The FT Interview: Hard-driving realist - Howard Davies It has been some years since British business had it so good. When Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, was recently with a group of West Midlands businessmen, only one was negative about his prospects. 'We looked at him as if he were a bad smell,' says Davies. Could all the CBI surveys capturing rising optimism among business leaders be wide of the mark? Davies took the man aside to seek out the problem. ' 'Oh, Howard, don't worry,' ' Davies recounts in a passable Brummy accent from his airy office high above London. ' 'We've just got some very bad products right now.' ' Davies returns to Birmingham on Sunday for the start of the CBI's annual conference. While grass roots members will have their usual share of gripes, the business outlook is unusually favourable. Inflation is at a 27-year low. The exchange rate is stable. Growth, exports and investment are accelerating. Even if interest rates have to rise further to keep inflation in check, they will not return to the double-digit levels of only a few years ago. The outlook is also good for the CBI as a lobbyist for business. Its views find a ready ear in Whitehall, especially with Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary. The relationship with the government is sweetness and light compared with 1980 when Sir Terence Beckett, a previous director-general, threatened a 'bare knuckle fight' over economic policy. So where is the next challenge for the hard-driving director-general, who seems to make as many media appearances as England's football manager. In the short term, he will be watching the government closely to make sure that it is not back-sliding on economic management. The temptation to switch from investment to consumption in order to line voters' pockets at the expense of business will strengthen as the next general election approaches. 'It is at the back of one's mind that they may well,' Davies says. An investment-led recovery requiring the government to bear down on public expenditure 'may not be popular' with the electorate, he concedes. Vigilant for such unwelcome policy shifts, Davies and the CBI will try to use their influence to keep the economy on a business-friendly track. Looking further ahead politically, the CBI is keen to further its dialogues with the Labour and Liberal Democratic parties. It is also keen to lobby the European Commission where, arguably, the real power will increasingly lie. All three organisations will be on the platform at the Birmingham meeting. Paddy Ashdown will be the first Liberal leader to address the CBI convention, following Labour's debut last year by John Smith. Labour's representative this year will be Robin Cook, until recently the party's pugnacious and effective industry spokesman. The CBI is less lucky in attracting Euroleaders to speak. Last year Jacques Delors, then EC president, pulled out at the last minute because of illness. This year, the CBI invited Jacques Santer, when he was a candidate to succeed Delors, but the new president appears to have decided to save his first UK public appearance for a bigger occasion. But the Commission's representative at Monday's morning session, Padraig Flynn, is hardly a make-weight. Responsible for the EU's social policy, he will be expected to respond to the charge, voiced by many a British business executive, that the commission's social charter on employment would be an instrument of ruin. 'Flynn will get a mixed reception,' Davies says. 'But it's a good sign that he more or less volunteered to come.' The commissioner is likely to be grilled by CBI members on the extra employment costs and inflexibilities laid down in the charter and Britain's chances of retaining its opt-out from it. To marshal ammunition, the CBI has conducted two extensive surveys on its members' Euro-thoughts that it will publish on Sunday. Broadly speaking, CBI members favour the EU and its enlargement, Davies says. But they worry about the costs, chafe at needless complexities and are disappointed by the degree reality falls short of rhetoric. The CBI's survey will show the single market remains highly imperfect for many goods and services. Davies is a realist. A future Labour government would sign Britain up to the charter regardless of vociferous business complaints, he concedes. Therefore, the CBI, which has a Brussels lobbying office, is working with UNICE, the European employer organisation, to make the charter less costly for business. Other themes in the conference schedule include long-term issues such as raising investment levels, improving competitiveness, the cost of environmental legislation and the difficulty of getting the unemployed back to work. For Davies, the pick-up in investment has been the most significant development in the last six months. Until the spring, the economic recovery had been led by consumption, with investment levels remaining stubbornly low for this stage in the cycle. This reflected the UK economy's slow response to stimuli such as lower interest rates. 'You give the thing a kick and this surly beast turns round and says 'what's going on?',' Davies says. One reason business has been slow to invest has been the volatility of the British economy compared with other countries. 'It takes people longer to believe things are better,' he says. But now that business has enjoyed an unusually long period of price, exchange rate and interest rate stability, it has begun investing again. 'We're back on track.' As a percentage of gross domestic product, investment is back to levels last seen in 1983-1984. After years of underinvestment compared with other countries, the CBI's bigger concern is to achieve a 'step change' in investment levels. Its budget proposals, for example, are an attempt to improve the return for investors. 'If we can recalibrate those things surrounding the investment decision, then the natural animal spirit of the British entrepreneur will have a free rein.'</p>

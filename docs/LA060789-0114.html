			<p><P> June 7, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: EXPANSION OF TRASH RECYCLING BEGINS  </P> <P> A major expansion of the city's curbside recycling program began Monday with  sanitation workers delivering special trash containers to Westchester  households.  </P> <P> Under the recycling plan, residents are being asked to place cans, glass  containers and plastic items in separate trash cans, said Gyl Elliot, a  spokeswoman for the Los Angeles Bureau of Sanitation.  </P> <P> As part of the pilot study, some residents are receiving 12-gallon containers  and others are getting 14-gallon ones, she said. Residents are also being asked  to save newspapers for a once-a-week pickup.  </P> <P> The trucks will then take the materials to vendors for purchase, Elliot said,  adding that the revenue will be used to pay for the program.  </P> <P> During the next few weeks, sanitation workers will drop off the canisters at  homes in Wilmington, the Crenshaw District, South-Central Los Angeles and the  Cheviot Hills and Beverlywood areas of West Los Angeles to bring the total to  32,000 households.  </P></p>

			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Held up on the western line: Latvia's tough citizenship rules are a blemish on its international image Closer than Switzerland' says the advertisement for a large private bank in the newly independent state of Latvia, which nestles between Russia and the Baltic Sea. The slogan could apply to the entire country, as it tries to rejoin the capitalist west from which it was torn by Stalin in 1940. With a strong currency and hopes of becoming a financial centre, Latvia is emerging as an island of relative economic stability within the former Soviet Union. However, Latvia's ambitions for a speedy reintegration with the west are threatened by a political problem which has festered for the past three years: whether non-Latvians, who make up almost half the population, should be given citizenship. On Tuesday, the Latvian parliament finally passed a law giving non-ethnic Latvians born in the country a chance to apply for naturalisation by 2000. But it imposes draconian citizenship quotas on non-Latvian residents who were not born in the country. These quotas mean Latvia is unlikely to join the Council of Europe, the 32-nation forum for human rights and democracy regarded as a stepping-stone for integration into western Europe. This is because such organisations, as part of their membership requirements, insist countries should not leave residents stateless. More importantly, the Latvian parliament's decision means any longer-term ambition to join the European Union and Nato - which Latvia sees as its best guarantee of security and independence - has been pushed further into the distance. Mr Hugh Hamilton, local representative of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, the 52-nation forum regulating borders and security, said yesterday: 'International opinion in general will be expressing concern that this law really does not accord with the norms of the western community which Latvia has been seeking to associate itself with.' Mr Valdis Birkavs, Latvia's prime minister, recognised the new difficulties created by parliament's vote when he told deputies: 'Let us cherish no illusions that we will wriggle out, that nothing bad will happen. These quotas can only complicate matters.' The ramifications are considerable. The curbs on citizenship will hinder economic progress because citizenship brings the right to own land as well as to vote. They are also hampering Latvia's attempts to mend relations with Russia and restore trade ties damaged by the collapse of the Soviet Union. Had it been able to devise a more internationally palatable solution to the citizenship issue, Latvia would have been better placed to build on its economic strengths. Since recovering its prewar independence in 1991, Latvia has run a near deficit-free budget. Its currency, the lat, is fully convertible and last year appreciated against the main western currencies. Under the monetarist stewardship of a fiercely independent central bank, Latvia's inflation and recession have been milder than in all its former Soviet neighbours other than Estonia. Latvia's GDP contracted by 12 per cent last year but has returned to modest growth this year. An inflation rate of 35 per cent last year is forecast by economists to fall to about 20 per cent this year - low by the standards of the former Soviet Union. High real interest rates and lack of foreign exchange controls have attracted capital fleeing instability elsewhere in the former Soviet Union. Mr Alexander Rannikh, Russian ambassador to Latvia, described the country as 'a Switzerland for second-class capital which is not ready for Switzerland but unsafe in Russia'. But the financial orthodoxy which has made Latvia a favourite of the International Monetary Fund contrasts sharply with its clumsy handling of its demographic arithmetic. As a result of the migration of Russians, Ukrainians and Belarussians to work at factories built under Soviet rule, ethnic Latvians today account for only 52 per cent of the population, compared with three-quarters before the country's annexation in 1940. Fearing Latvians could be swamped by 'Russian-speakers', parliament decided in the run-up to independence to restrict citizenship to pre-1940 citizens and their descendants. This arrangement effectively disenfranchised 700,000 people who had the vote when Latvia was part of the Soviet Union. The legislation approved this week will enable spouses of citizens, plus more than 200,000 Russian-speakers born in Latvia, to apply for citizenship by 2000. But Mr Hans-Peter Furrer, the Council of Europe's director for political affairs, said the quotas in the new law would mean only about 2,000 people born outside Latvia (out of a total of 300,000 in this category) would qualify for citizenship each year after 2000. Latvia can argue that it faces a unique dilemma - few countries' demography have been so radically altered in a relatively short period. But while sympathetic to its circumstances, Mr Furrer and the CSCE's Mr Hamilton believe Latvia could have protected its national identity and security without quotas - via, for instance, a requirement that citizens can speak Latvian. Mr Nils Muiznieks, a US-born academic, explained the reluctance to grant citizenship as a mixture of a desire by extreme nationalists to encourage Russian speakers to leave, and fears among more moderate politicians that giving them the vote could 'slow' Latvia's market reforms and create a 'fifth column' of potentially disloyal citizens. Many Russian speakers work in Soviet-era factories now likely to close and are regarded by ethnic Latvians as inclining to the east rather than to the west. The irony is that many Russians, who constituted the local elite in the Soviet era, have become akin to the Jews of the Tsarist empire. Excluded from government posts, they have thrived on business, which they dominate. Local Russian-language radio in the capital Riga plays locally produced pop songs with lyrics about the delights of going into 'biznez'. Mr Boris Tsilevich, a Jewish writer who has taken up the cause of non-citizens, said a large segment of the population was being unnecessarily alienated. 'If Russian-speakers turn out to be the 'fifth column' Latvians talk about, it will have been built by Latvian hands.' Perhaps more worrying is the reversal of progress in repairing relations with Russia which could ensue from parliament's decision this week. Last month the two countries signed an agreement on the withdrawal of the remaining Russian troops by August 31. In return, Latvia agreed to give residence permits to retired Russian officers who decide to stay. Russia made clear its displeasure at the reappearance of quotas in the draft citizenship law earlier this month when it postponed indefinitely a planned visit to Latvia by Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, Russian prime minister. In anticipation of the visit, a trading agreement between Russia and Latvia, halving import and export duties on trade between the two countries, came into force at the beginning of this month. Latvia's eagerness to recover markets in the east is being spurred by fears that, in spite of its pro-western outlook, overpowering competition from more developed capitalist economies could see its national interests subjugated to those of foreign investors. The danger Latvia faces is of upsetting both east and west. On the one hand, the citizenship law may fuel the demands of Russian nationalists in Russia, thus creating greater regional instability. On the other hand, Latvia has harmed its chances of winning acceptance by the western organisations that could protect its independence - and bring economic benefits - whatever happens in Russia.</p>

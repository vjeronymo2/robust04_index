			<p>BFN     [Text] The Inkatha Freedom Party has added its voice to the  widespread praise still pouring in for Mr. Mandela's revised  reconstruction program announced in his state of the nation  address in Parliament yesterday. IFP spokesman Hennie Bekker  said his party would support the plan as far as it was practical  and feasible, but there was cause for concern that expectations  were being created that could not be fulfilled. Industry and  commerce, as well as politicians across the spectrum, including  the National Party, the Democratic Party, and the Pan-Africanist  Congress, have already expressed their support for the  president's vision. Others, like the Freedom Front, expressed  guarded optimism.</p>

			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Business and the Environment: Energy Trust slow to gain speed It was going to be one of Britain's answers to global warming. Plans for an Energy Saving Trust to look at ways of using energy more efficiently featured in the Conservative Party general election manifesto in April. A month later, Michael Howard, environment minister, called the Trust 'an important initiative to protect the environment', and made much of it at the Rio Earth Summit in June. But five months after the first declarations, little appears to have moved. The Trust still lacks a chairman and its pilot projects, which were going to invest Pounds 6m in the first year, are on hold. The purpose of the proposed Trust - in reality a company limited by guarantee - is to search out investments for British Gas or the 12 regional electricity companies that will help their customers to use energy more efficiently. The first three pilot schemes were chosen to encourage: More efficient use of gas by low-income households. Purchase of more efficient heating when households replace old systems. Investment in small-scale generators for both heat and power, in hostels, blocks of flats, and small factories. The pilots were expected to cost Pounds 6m in the first year of operation. British Gas - which spends around Pounds 10m per year on other energy saving schemes - would be allowed to pass that through to the gas consumer, adding some 30p a year to bills, Ofgas estimates. One of the Trust's other roles would be to help the regulators Ofgas and Offer - which supervise the increases in gas and electricity bills  - judge whether projects merited such 'cost pass through'. There have been several reasons why progress has been slight, although British Gas expects the Trust to be running by next May, just within the original timetable. First, the lack of a chairman has prevented the appointment of a full-time chief executive or a board of directors. The Department of the Environment, which is setting up the Trust through its Energy Efficiency Office (EEO), says the appointment is 'a political matter' and will not comment on the apparent delay. Part of the problem may be that the Trust's creators have set their sights high. Colin Myerscough of the EEO says that the Trust has been looking for a 'high status' person possibly with business experience who 'can talk to the top executives of the utilities as an equal'. Luring that kind of worldly negotiator to public sector posts has never been easy. Delays also seem to have arisen when the original gas remit was broadened. John Dawkin, Ofgas's deputy director general, says: 'It is moving more slowly than we would have wished partly because the government wanted a wider brief.' He adds that momentum may have been lost when it moved to the EEO. In the long run he expects the wider remit to be fruitful. Even with a board in place, questions remain about the Trust's likely effectiveness - and who will benefit. For a start, why should the utilities encourage their customers to use less energy, if this leads to lower revenues? In Dawkin's view: 'British Gas will certainly suggest schemes where it doesn't lose out. One could look at ways of getting round that, but at the moment the priority is getting started.' However, both he and Myerscough suggest that in the long run the schemes are to their advantage because gas and electricity compete when consumers re-equip their homes. It is clear, though, that in the depths of a recession it may take a long time before householders take up this new technology. It seems likely too that the consumer will foot the bill for projects which get the Trust's backing. According to Myerscough: 'The utilities have made clear that they want most of the costs passed on - and the Trust's approval could encourage the regulator to allow that.' Ofgas responds that 'we will have to be sure, before approving projects, that it is in the benefit of British Gas's customers'. Despite the delays, those involved remain confident. According to Dawkin: 'I don't think it will solve Britain's problems in one fell swoop but it can make a significant contribution.'</p>

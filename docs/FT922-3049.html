			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: UK economy The good news is that underlying inflation is showing some real improvement at last. Retail prices excluding mortgage payments rose an annual 5.3 per cent in May compared with 5.7 per cent in April. Better still, service sector inflation, which has long resisted treatment, has begun to abate. The process should continue, even though there remain one or two sticky points, like motor insurance premiums. The bad news is that the fall in inflation is to some extent a measure of desperation about the economy. Thursday's CBI distribution survey showed that post-election optimism fizzled out in May, while City economists are busy cutting their growth forecasts for the year to almost nothing. A combination of success on the inflation front and continuing economic weakness ought to provide the government with a ready excuse for cutting interest rates. Since Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht Treaty, that prospect has become even more remote. Base rates may be 5 points below their peak, but more cuts will be needed to breathe life into the housing market, in turn a prerequisite for serious recovery. With the FT-SE 134 points below its peak on May 11, a fair amount of this must already be in the market. Certainly, the economy is not actually weakening any more, and the index is in sight of the trading range established during the first quarter when investors were grappling with electoral uncertainty. The problem is that the implications of economic stagnation for corporate earnings in 1992 may not have fully sunk in. Wall Street is showing signs of nervousness. And there is a daunting number of new issues to get away, even if some of the proceeds of the Wellcome issue will doubtless be reinvested in UK equities.</p>

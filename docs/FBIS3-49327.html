			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bratunac, Jan 9 (TANJUG) -- Moslem troops in  Sarajevo are increasingly using civilian facilities to fire at  the Serb positions in that city, sources in the Bosnian Serb  army said on Sunday.    The Moslems are firing at us over the positions held by U.N.  peace-keepers from their strongholds in hospitals, post  buildings and other exclusively civilian facilities, the sources  add.    The aim is obviously to try to provoke us into neutralizing  these Moslem nests so that we could then be blamed for attacking  civilian targets, they explained.    The same sources said that the Moslems had used the same  tactics before to fire at Serb and U.N. positions in Sarajevo,  the capital of war-torn Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The Serb side has protested with the U.N. Protection Force  over this practice, but to no avail.    Moslem provocations in Sarajevo continue on Sunday, with the  brunt of the Moslem mortar fire directed at Serb-controlled  sections of Ilidza, Nedzarici, Grbavica, Dobrinja 4, Vogosca and  Rajlovac, the Bosnian Serb Army said.    Over the past 24 hours, the Moslems were attacking Serb  military and civilian targets throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina, it  added.    Bosnian Serb troops are firmly holding their positions and  responding only when absolutely forced to do so, the Bosnian  Serb army said.    It added that the Moslem troops in the Gorazde enclave in  the  east continued their attacks on Serb-controlled Foca and Cajnice.    Sources in the Bosnian Serb Army also said that, despite a  U.N. ban on military flights over Bosnia, Moslem helicopters  were flying from Orasje to Gradacac and Tuzla in northern  Bosnia, and over the areas of Vares, Breza, Visoko, Kiseljak and  Vozuce in central Bosnia, where Moslems and Croats have been  fighting pitched battles since the spring of 1992.    The Serb side has duly informed the U.N. command about the  unauthorized Moslem helicopter flights, the Bosnian Serb  military sources said and added that the U.N. command had failed  to react to an earlier warning from the Bosnian Serb command  that unless such flights stopped, the Bosnian Serb anti-aircraft  defence would be forced to itself prevent similar incidents from  recurring.</p>

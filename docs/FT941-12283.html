			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / International Company News: Semiconductor sales lift Texas Instrument Texas Instruments, the US semiconductor and electronics manufacturer, reported strong fourth-quarter results to cap one of the best financial years in the company's history. Growth in semiconductor sales drove revenues for the fourth quarter up 19 per cent to Dollars 2.4bn from Dollars 2.0bn in the same period last year. Net income was Dollars 134m, or Dollars 1.42 a share, compared with Dollars 78m, or 80 cents, in the fourth quarter of 1992. Profit from operations increased 75 per cent to Dollars 198m from Dollars 113m in the same period of 1992. The increase reflects improved results from semiconductor operations and an increase in patent royalties, which rose to Dollars 133m from Dollars 89m in the same period last year. Fourth-quarter results for 1993 included an accrual of Dollars 31m for employee profit sharing and a pre-tax charge of Dollars 23m related to the consolidation of TI's consumer and peripheral products businesses. For the full year, TI's revenues rose to Dollars 8.5bn from Dollars 7.4bn in 1992. Essentially all of the increase was in semiconductor revenues, the company said. Net income for the year was Dollars 472m, or Dollars 5.03 per share compared with Dollars 247m or Dollars 2.50 per share in 1992. Profits from operations rose 73 per cent to Dollars 728m from Dollars 420m in 1992. Revenues from components, the bulk of which are semiconductor devices, rose 28 per cent to Dollars 5.1bn for the year from Dollars 4.0bn in 1992. About half of semiconductor revenues were from 'differentiated products', TI said, reflecting the company's strategy to diversify beyond its strong position in the market for standard memory chips. Royalty revenues for the year rose 33 per cent to Dollars 521m from Dollars 391m in 1992.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 31/3/1994 -- Daily ADEVARUL  comments on a deadline set for 1 April 1994 in the Republic of  Moldova: Staff's examination with regard to their knowledge of  the state language, an opportunity to reveal the maneuvers of  the anti-Romanian quarters aiming at a relapse to the situation  existing in the defunct USSR, when the official language in the  republic was Russian.    Showing that the previous deadline was 1 January 1994, then  postponed "to avoid trouble before the 27 February elections,"  the paper writes: "The poll is gone, and its returns known: The  agrarians hold the majority in the legislative and together with  the socialists (former communists and also Russian-speakers of  the `Edinstvo-Unity' movement) they hold two-thirds of all  deputy seats. Is this why the deadline for the examination is  still uncertain?" -- the daily wonders.    "As a matter of fact, the majority's stand is known. The  socialists and Russian-speakers made a big fuss, while  electioneering, about the enforcement of the state language law.  But they circumvented the content of the law. For, the  law-makers meant that the examination to be passed only by the  executives of the state enterprises and institutions and the  functionaries (of the same state institutions) who get into  direct touch with the public. It was only they who ought to have  acquired the least knowledge of Romanian language inside six  years.    "But, in order to be more convincing, to infuriate their own  electorate, the Russian-speaking leaders threatened that the  whole population having a different mother-tongue would be fired  unless it complied with the above-mentioned provision. Too  preposterous to need further comment. But it is just as true  that a number of Russians, which is not at all inconsequential,  hold leading offices with state institutions and they have not  learned Romanian, hoping for a return to the old rules. For,  that is what the respective leaders want: The Russian to become  a state language once more, along with the language of the  majority population, which they call "`Moldovan.'"</p>

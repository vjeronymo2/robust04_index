The new agreement was signed here October 18, 1993 between  the Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and  Kazakhstan Foreign Minister T. I. Suleymenov, on behalf of their  respective governments.    According to the new agreement, diplomatic and service  passports holders and their children under age will be exempted  from entry, exit and transit visas when passing through ports  which are open to international visitors or designated by the  two sides.    Visitors who need to stay for more than 30 days must undergo  certain procedures required by local regulations of the country  they stay in. That is, Chinese should apply to the Foreign  Ministry of Kazakhstan for exit visas through host units;  Kazakhs should apply to the Chinese public security organs for  residence permits.</p>

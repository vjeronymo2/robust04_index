			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / International Company News: Travelers hit by asbestos claims A RISE in the number of environmental damage and asbestos-related claims has forced Travelers, the US insurer, to add Dollars 325m to its property-casualty reserves and take an after-tax charge of Dollars 211m in its third quarter. The addition to reserves and charge mean Travelers will record a net loss for the July-September reporting period when it releases its results next week. The company, however, said its operating earnings will show an improvement over the year. Primerica Corporation, the financial services group which owns a 27 per cent stake in Travelers and which agreed last month to a full merger with the insurer, said yesterday the charge would have no impact on its third quarter or full-year results. Travelers said it has bolstered its asbestos and environmental litigation reserves, which now stand at Dollars 670m, for three reasons: an increase in the number of industry workers alleging they have been exposed to asbestos; a rise in environmental claims made by smaller companies; and the naming of Travelers as a defendant in insurance coverage cases brought by other insurers against their policyholders and the policyholders' other carriers. Investors took yesterday's announcement in their stride, and by the close Travelers' share price was down Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 37 7/8 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>

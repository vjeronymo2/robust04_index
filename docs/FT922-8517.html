			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Letter: Auditors' image moves misdirected Sir, I am dismayed at the misdirected attempts of the auditing profession to reform its image (Letters, May 7). For example, the proposal for interim accounts to be audited is clearly self-serving and will add to audit costs. The profession is trying to widen the scope of its involvement at the same time as avoiding taking responsibility for the traditional audit. A reversal of the 'Caparo' decision is long overdue. There is no point in widening the scope of the auditors' remit if investors cannot rely upon the existing annual audit opinion.

Group member Fedor Shelov-Kovedyaev told journalists that,  according to the statement, there are at least two wings in the  government, one of which, according to the lawmaker, "rests on  laurels and feels well at the expense of the other".    The pragmatic wing parasitizes on reform-minded cabinet  members, shifting onto them responsibility for all actions by  the government, he continued. Shelov-Kovedyaev said that the  group's statement will be soon made public and, according to the  legislator, will give a helping hand to Gaydar.    Shelov-Kovedyaev said that "according to the latest  information, Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin is interested in  continuing negotiations" on this issue.    Replying to ITAR-TASS, another group member, Gennadiy  Burbulis, former secretary of state, said: "I believe that  everything will be clear within the next two days. Then, it  will be possible to draw conclusions and make comments. It is  too early now to say anything".</p>

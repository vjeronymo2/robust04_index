			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Investigations Department report under the "Rumors" rubric: </F> "`Vympel' Stays at the MVD"]    [Text] The rumors that have appeared that "Vympel" is  returning to the FCS [Federal Counterintelligence Service] have  been greatly exaggerated. There has been no talk of this, and  nobody has even had such a thought, so the press services of the  MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] and the FCS have declared.  Moreover, "Vympel" does not exist as such. Following the  special group's transfer to the MVD, the "Vega" special subunit  was created on its basis.    Work is now being conducted within the FCS itself to create  its own operational administration. The FCS Press Service does  not possess any more detailed information at present.</p>

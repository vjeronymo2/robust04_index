			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / World Bond Markets: Brazil maintains issue supply - Eurobonds Banco Votorantim's three-year eurobond last week came on the heels of several other Brazilian eurobond offerings and suggests that a recent tax increase on issuers, while leading to some postponements, has not choked off supply. Prospects are expected to improve strongly if the newly elected President, Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, is able to consolidate the successes achieved by his Real plan. Mr Cardoso, whose election was welcomed by the business community, takes office in January. Last month, the Brazilian government increased to 7 per cent from 3 per cent the tax on money raised by eurobond issues in an attempt to limit foreign exchange inflow. Bankers say the tax may slow down growth but will not affect the core market. Mr Edvaldo Morata, a vice-president at Dutch-owned ING Bank's Sao Paulo office, noted that the Dollars 50m Banco Votorantim issue, which ING Bank lead-managed, had been postponed for about 10 days while the issuer recalculated its costs following the tax increase. 'They realised that it was still worth it as they could lend the capital in Brazil at high local interest rates,' said Mr Morata. As well as Banco Votorantim there have been issues by Iochpe-Maxion, a car parts company, Riocell, a pulp company, and Sophora Comercio, a financial management company, since the tax increase. Nevertheless, Brazilian issues, like Latin American issues in general, have been sharply reduced this year because of the turbulence in world interest rates. According to West Merchant Bank in London, Brazilian euromarket issues totalled Dollars 1.8bn in the first three quarters of this year compared with Dollars 4.5bn for the same period last year. Bankers believe that economic success for the new government will lead to a narrowing in the yield spreads paid by Brazilian issuers, as well as an increase in the demand for capital by local companies. Currently Brazilian issuers on average pay 400 to 500 basis points above US Treasury bonds. This compares with up to 250 basis points for Mexican issuers. Mr Paul Stocking, a vice-president at JP Morgan's emerging market research in New York, is cautiously optimistic about increased demand for Brazilian issues butstressed that a further increase in demand for Brazilian paper depends on economic reforms similar to those already implemented in Mexico and Argentina. Until then 'the international market will continue to expect a premium from Brazilian issuers', he said. Some analysts believe that, given the size of Brazil's economy and the competitiveness of its private sector, Brazilian eurobond spreads could come down by 100 basis points to the Argentine level by 1995, providing reforms are introduced and inflation controlled. 'The next question is when Brazil will overtake Mexico,' said one Sao Paulo banker.</p>

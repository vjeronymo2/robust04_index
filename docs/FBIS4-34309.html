			<p>BFN     [Text] President Juan Carlos Wasmosy returned last night to  Asuncion from the Fourth Ibero-American Summit that was held in  Cartagena [Colombia] between 13 and 15 June. Wasmosy met with  his Ecuadoran and Chilean colleagues, Sixto Duran Ballen and  Eduardo Frei, respectively, on 16 May in that city.    During his first address, Wasmosy's call for a sea outlet  for  our country was warmly received by Frei, who promised his  government will immediately begin the construction and paving of  the 60 km stretch of highway that will connect northeast  Argentina and Antofagasta [Chile] and thus open an outlet to the  Pacific for our exports.    Wasmosy stressed that his government will improve and pave  the highway that connects Mariscal Estigarribia [Paraguay] with  Pozo Hondo [Paraguay] through Mision La Paz [Argentina], which  will make possible the connection with Chile.    It must be reported that Wasmosy's appeal for a sea outlet  with a smoother policy did not receive encouraging answers from  Argentina or Uruguay. The president indicated that speeches  have no significance if in practice there is no real  cooperation. The president questioned the customs tariffs that  Argentina charges on our exports.    He also said he cannot conceive the river waterway without  the incorporation of the River Plate.    During his meeting with Duran Ballen, Wasmosy invited him to  officially visit our country. The Ecuadoran president will  visit the country at the end of the year with a trade mission.    Wasmosy also met with Colombian President Cesar Gaviria in  Cartagena's Hilton Hotel. Gaviria later reported that he  promised his Paraguayan colleague that within the next few days  he will send a mission of legal experts to advise the executive  branch on the drafting of a bill for the repression of drug  trafficking. He gave no more details.    Another topic discussed by the two presidents is that  Paraguay should make its presence felt more at the OAS taking  into account that Gaviria will in the near future take over as  secretary general of the organization replacing Joao Baena  Soares.    Ruben Melgarejo Lanzoni, Paraguayan ambassador to the OAS,  who also participated in the meeting, indicated that Gaviria  promised a larger participation in the organization's posts to  our country, including the post of OAS representative to member  countries.    Melgarejo Lanzoni also indicated that he did not reject the  idea that the Mercosur [Common Market of the South] Treaty could  be modified to allow the membership of Chile and Bolivia. He  indicated that Wasmosy and Frei had also discussed the topic.    Wasmosy reported that he will thoroughly overhaul the  foreign  service "by creating a school of diplomacy," in other words,  establish a career system that will remain unchanged no matter  who is in power. "Our foreign policy must be one and one  alone," he said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Shi Jun (4258 6511): "Take Improvement of Economic </F> Results As the Core in Accelerating Economic Development"]    [Text] Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping contains the largest number of expositions on  accelerating economic development and is richest in contents in  this regard. One of the conspicuous ideas is that, while  improving economic results, we should accelerate economic  development. In his talks during an inspection tour to southern  China, he pointed out: "Those blessed with conditions  advantageous to development should not be obstructed. In areas  where conditions permit, local development should proceed as  fast as possible. Nothing is to be feared so long as we stress  efficiency and quality and develop the export-oriented economy."  He also pointed out: "In developing China's economy, we should  strive to reach a new rung every few years. Of course, this  should not be interpreted as encouraging an unrealistically high  speed. We should be down to earth and stress efficiency to  realize steady and coordinated progress." When hearing reports  on the Sixth Five-Year Plan, he pointed out: "We should attach  importance to improving economic results and not blindly pursue  growth in output value and output." On two occasions when  hearing reports on the economic situation, he stressed: "We  should not stress only product quantity but should first stress  quality. The key to expanding export sales lies in improving  product quality.... Otherwise, the long-term, sustained, and  stable development of the economy will be out of the question  and the economy will eventually wither some day." "In  industrial production, especially the production of export  products, the focus is on improving quality and placing quality  first."    We can thus see that there are conditions, preconditions, or  basic requirements when Comrade Deng Xiaoping stresses the need  to accelerate economic development. These conditions,  preconditions, or basic requirements are efficiency, quality,  export orientation, and the maintenance of stable and  coordinated development or, what we usually call economic  results in a broad sense. Therefore, when considering the issue  of accelerating economic development, we must place the  fundamental starting point on improving economic results:  "Shifting the economic work as a whole onto an orbit based on  improving the economic results."    At present, China's economic work still falls far short of  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's aforesaid demands. This finds  expression in the following four principal aspects: 1.  The economic results are still relatively poor. In recent  years, China's total output value of industrial production has  been growing at an average annual rate of over 10 percent,  reaching over 20 percent in certain years, but the number of  enterprises operating at a loss and the total amount of losses  have kept on rising. In the first 11 months of 1993, the four  principal performance indicators, i.e., the product sales rate,  the ratio of profits and taxes to capital, the cost-profit  ratio, and the rate of circulating fund turnover, were all lower  than the levels during the Seventh Five-Year Plan. This  situation of high speed and poor efficiency shows that China's  industry has not changed its extensive operation of highly  efficient mobilization but inefficient use of resources.  2. Product quality has not been improved  considerably. Despite much efforts to improve quality,  there have been little results. Not only have the grade and  level of many products not been raised but the production of  shoddy products has continued in spite of repeated prohibitions.  What is more serious is that there have been frequent cases of  fake and shoddy products, especially fake medicines,  insecticides, and chemical fertilizers which harm the state and  the people. The quality of a country and a nation is eventually  reflected in its material products; the economic results of an  enterprise also come directly from its products. Without high  quality products, how can we get good economic results and  improve the quality of people's lives? 3. The growth in  export earnings has been less than satisfactory. According  to statistics, in the first 11 months of 1993, the country's  total import and export volume rose by 16.5 percent over the  corresponding period in the previous year. Total import volume  grew by 27.8 percent while total export volume by only 6.2  percent, a disparity of over 20 percentage points. We should  affirm the tremendous achievements in opening up to the outside  world but we should not overlook the problems in developing an  export-oriented economy, especially in increasing foreign  exchange earnings through exports. If we fail to increase  export earnings, this will in turn restrict our efforts to open  wider to the outside world. We must attach great importance to  the economic results in developing an export-oriented  economy--export earnings. Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed this  out as far back as in 1985. He said: "We have just started to  turn the economy in the special economic zones from  domestic-oriented to export-oriented and, for this reason, we  still do not have many good products for export. As long as  Shenzhen fails to do this, it has not passed the test and cannot  prove that its development is sound." Naturally, we cannot say  that Shenzhen and many coastal areas have not passed the test  till now. However, as far as most localities and enterprises are  concerned, they have not yet passed the test or at least have  not passed the test satisfactorialy. 4. The economic  structure is still irrational. Imbalances in the economic  structure have always been a major problem obstructing China's  sound economic growth. It is also a fundamental crux affecting  the improvement of economic results. Although we have made  constant adjustments, we have not been able to get rid of the  interruptive and ill effects of an imbalanced structure. Today,  the irrational conditions in product mix, industrial structure,  and the enterprise organization pattern are still quite serious  and are tending to worsen in some respects. The chief  manifestations are: Infrastructure has obviously lagged behind  in national economic development; basic industry has lagged far  behind the processing industry; within the processing industry,  goods in great demand are extremely undersupplied while goods  for which there is no consumer demand are extremely  oversupplied; and the level of enterprise specialized and  socialized production is low. According to surveys, in recent  years we have been able to meet only about 80 percent of demand  for power supplies, 60 percent of demand for railway transport,  and only one-third of the demand for some major bottleneck  aspects [zhu yao xian zhi kou 0031 6008 7098 0455 0656]. In  light of the irrational economic structure, in a talk with  comrades in charge of the State Planning Commission in 1982  Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "In our overall economic  development strategy, energy and transport are focus points as  is agriculture." He also pointed out: "If we really want to  engage in construction, we should build some key projects. It  will not do if we do not have some key projects.... We would  rather cut back on local projects, especially some ordinary  processing industrial projects." In December 1986, he again  stressed that "we can only take this path." It now seems that  we should take this path even more unswervingly.    What should we do to improve economic results? Aside  from deepening reform, we should rely on scientific and  technological progress and improvement in the quality of  laborers. Comrade Deng Xiaoping has a series of  expositions on this count. At the National Conference on  Science in March 1978, Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: "Contemporary  natural science is being applied to production on an  unprecedented scale and with unprecedented speed. This has  given all fields of material production an entirely new look.  With the same manpower and the same number of man-hours, people  can turn out scores or hundreds of times more products than  before now. What has brought about the tremendous advances in  the productive forces and the vast increase in labor  productivity? Mainly the power of science and the power of  technology." In 1988 Comrade Deng Xiaoping again made a highly  theoretical condensation of the primary transformation role of  science and technology in contemporary productive forces and  socioeconomic development from a new angle of view. He pointed  out: "Marx said that science and technology are productive  forces and facts have proven that his remark is quite correct.  As I see it, science and technology are primary productive  forces." Precisely because he has a profound understanding of  the tremendous role of contemporary science and technology,  Comrade Deng Xiaoping has repeatedly stressed: China cannot  develop without science. It must rely on science, technology,  and education.    In line with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's aforementioned ideas,  the 13th Party Congress explicitly put forward the need to  "place the development of scientific, technological, and  educational cause in first place and shift economic construction  onto the orbit of relying on scientific and technological  progress and improving the quality of laborers."    It should be soberly noted that promoting scientific and  technological progress and improving the quality of laborers is  an arduous, complex, and gigantic project which requires hard  and protracted efforts on our part. At present, further efforts  should be made to solve the following three issues well:    First, uphold the principle that economic construction  must rely on science and technology and that the latter must be  geared to the former. Science and technology should give  priority to promoting economic construction and improving  economic results; vigorously strengthening the integration of  science and industry, of science and agriculture, and the  integration of science and trade; and quickening the pace of  turning scientific and technological achievements into real  productive forces. We should attach importance to the  technological renovation of existing enterprises and improve the  economic results of stock assets by improving and developing  production technology, optimizing the allocation of incremental  assets, and improving the economic results of stock assets.    Second, attach great importance to education,  especially the training of in-service workers and staff members,  to improve the quality of laborers. While affirming the  vigorous development of educational undertakings, we must also  squarely face the problems that exist. Viewed from the current  situation, the many problems criticized by Comrade Deng Xiaoping  have not been resolved and some have even taken a continuous  turn for the worse. Take for example, the remuneration of  intellectuals. The leaders of some localities and units spend a  lot of money on new sedans but they do not guarantee the basic  wages of teachers. The phenomenon of stressing formality and  going through the motions in training in-service workers and  staff members is also conspicuous, leading to a relative drop in  the quality of workers and staff members in many enterprises.  For this reason, we should keep firmly in mind Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's instruction that "education should be firmly  grasped," put in a lot of time and energy in realistically  solving the existing problems, and speedily raise the quality of  laborers.    Third, energetically study and take for reference  advanced foreign technology and managerial expertise and follow  a new path of mastering and assimilating imported  technology. In the past few years, we have continuously  broadened the scope of studying and taking for reference  advanced foreign technology and managerial experience but we  have not attached sufficient importance to the work of mastering  and assimilating what we have imported. We have spent a lot of  money importing equipment, even advanced equipment, but we have  not done a good job of mastering and assimilating what we have  imported and some equipment has not been applied in production  for a long time. Although we have introduced a lot of advanced  managerial expertise, we have mastered little, with some being  pigeonholed or laid aside. This trend should be rectified as  quickly as possible. When importing advanced foreign technology  and managerial expertise in future, we should conduct scientific  demonstrations and make the correct choice. We should consider  not only their advanced character but, more importantly, their  suitability. Genuine efforts should be made to closely  integrate their introduction into the country with their mastery  and assimilation and we should be good at turning other people's  know-how into our own.    In short, improving economic results is a crucial issue  which  has a bearing on whether or not we can increase our  comprehensive national power, raise the people's living  standards, and build up our capacity for sustained economic  development. This should draw the close attention of the whole  party. Conscientious efforts should be made to rectify the  tendency of regarding speed as superior to efficiency and  unswervingly take the development path of stressing quality and  efficiency to promote the sustained, rapid, and healthy [chi xu,  kuai su, jian kang 2170 4958, 1816 6643, 0256 1660] development  of the national economy.</p>

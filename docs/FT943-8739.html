			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Minicars feel squeeze in Japan Imported cars are more popular than ever in Japan, but there is one segment of the market in which foreign makers have been unable to find space: the so-called minicars. Not any minicars - the Rover Mini does not qualify under the Japanese definition. Nor does any other foreign car. The tightest parking space in Tokyo is a rectangle of 3.3 metres by 1.4 metres, as delineated by the Transport Ministry, which uses these measurements as a guide to what is a minicar. The ministry has this month begun to consider increasing the permissible length by 10cm. But the Mini, which fits lengthways, is 4cm too wide. And its engine is too big. The maximum displacement is 660cc, though Japanese makers such as Subaru, Suzuki and Daihatsu commonly fit turbochargers to boost power. About 1.5m minicars are sold each year, and their owners benefit from sharply lower tax and insurance when they buy the car and reduced charges for roadworthiness inspections in subsequent years. In addition, unlike city owners of other vehicles, they do not have to produce a police certificate showing they have somewhere to put the car at night. The showroom price of a Mini Mayfair is within Y2,000 (Dollars 20) of that for a Daihatsu Mira. But according to the Japan Automobile Importers Association, the difference in getting it on the road for a year grows to Y80,320, even before paying the landlord a hefty square footage for using a corner of his backyard. Rover Japan says that if its Mini met the ministry's minicar specifications, costs of owning one for five years would fall by about a fifth. It is among importers which - through the European Business Community Council, a grouping of EU chambers of commerce - is calling on the Transport Ministry to consider not just specifying a longer minicar so that not only local makers can measure up, but abolishing the category altogether. Standards for minicars in Japan have been progressively brought closer to those of regular passenger vehicles since they were introduced as a post-war way of enabling manufacturers of motorcycles and agricultural machinery to join the automotive boom. It led to a crowded car market, but one where minicar protection has helped enable companies like Suzuki to stay in the black during domestic downturn. The latest change in length, proposed this month, is intended to allow them to meet the same safety requirements for a frontal impact as larger cars. Transport Ministry officials argue that the distinction between minicars and others is relevant to energy efficiency. Mr Hitoshi Usami, a deputy director of its roads bureau, says that Japan's small land mass and narrow streets also justify its retention. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry is more ambivalent, pointing out that Toyota and Nissan, the two biggest domestic car makers, have no direct involvement in minicars and see almost as little advantage from the distinction as the foreign suppliers do. 'The benefits are lost as the lengths are stretched,' a Miti official said yesterday. The Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association, which groups domestic car producers, could not agree on whether to ask for an increase in engine size to go with the longer body profile, and minicar makers are said themselves to be divided about what happens next. No US maker has a subcompact model which comes close to minicar requirements, but as Mr David Blume, Rover Japan marketing director, puts it, 'Europe has a lot of strength at that end of the market.' Fiat's new Cinquecento, like Rover's quarter century-old Mini, loses out not on length, but because it is 8.7cm too wide and packs 240cc too much capacity under the bonnet.</p>

			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / International Bonds: Dealers slow to appreciate benefits of rechristening THE Association of Inter-national Bond Dealers is to meet for the last time later this week. At its annual conference in Hong Kong, the regulatory body of the Eurobond market will be reconstituted under a new name which better reflects its broadening constituency. The change marks a shift in direction as the AIBD leaves behind its roots as a trade association and espouses broader issues. However the move to re-christen the AIBD has met surprising resistance, considering the disadvantages of a name which, in the minds of many market participants, still stands for the Association of International Beer Drinkers. The proposal to change the name to the International Capital Market Association met with disapproval from nostalgic traders unwilling to see the organisation move away from its traditional base. The AIBD's leadership, however, sees the need for the association, which has already developed from a trade association to a regulatory bond, to evolve. The similarity between the pronunciation of IPMA and ICMA prompted some disquiet at the International Primary Market Association, the trade association of the new issues market which broke away from the AIBD in the mid-1980s. Some market participants feel there is no longer a separate role for IPMA, and the two trade associations should band together. In that case, issues such as the payment of lead management commissions could be discussed and resolved in the context of a more powerful body. However, a potential merger between the two groups still seems to be a long way off, and political interests may forestall any such development. There have been no discussions between the two bodies, even though many members are in both, and might favour a streamlining. The proposal to rename the organisation ICMA also met some objections from foreign members who felt that 'capital' might be misunderstood. Consequently, the proposed name has been changed to the International Securities Market Association (ISMA), which was felt to be both sufficiently broad and accurate. 'The name (AIBD) no longer truly represents our members, a lot of whom have taken on several other functions (apart from dealing),' said Mr John Langton, the AIBD's chief executive. As well as the handful of statute changes (including the name issue) due to be discussed at the meeting, a number of issues not on the official agenda are likely to arise. Under an amendment to the directive proposed by the French, Eurobond transactions would have to be traded on regulated exchanges, and more extensive price and volume reporting would be required. Although all UK and some European firms report their trades to the AIBD, the association would not be recognised as an exchange. The AIBD has been actively lobbying the EC to prevent such a development, but a stalemate appears to have been reached. The argument advanced by the French, that off-exchange trading means inadequate investor protection, is strongly rejected by the AIBD, which, as a designated investment exchange under UK law, has been fighting to have its statues and rule book recognised. The AIBD is concerned that forcing all trades on to regulated exchanges will limit cross border trading and reduce liquidity. At the moment, something of an impasse appears to have been reached, with the UK, Germany, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, on one side, and the rest of the community, led by France, on the other. However, the AIBD is optimistic that it will succeed in persuading the EC to accept its statutes and rules as fair and equitable. The next step would be to try to obtain regulatory status, Mr Langton said. The dispute over settlement procedures between the two European clearing systems, Euroclear and Cedel, is also likely to resurface, even though most market participants say they have 'learnt to live with it'. Hopes have again been raised that agreement is near after an AIBD market practices committee last week and a number of meetings between the three parties (with the AIBD acting as a go-between). 'Euroclear has made a number of concessions and Cedel has respected those and made some concessions too,' said Mr Langton, who added that there was 'an excellent chance' the problem would be resolved during this week's meeting. Last year, the two clearing systems agreed to renegotiate their 10-year-old bridge agreement, widening the issue at stake from an original contention about primary market settlement. The bridge between the clearers is the mechanism by which settlement information is exchanged and is generally agreed to have become outdated. A memorandum of understanding was signed last September. In October, Cedel put forward a proposal incorporating the need for multiple exchange of files. Then in December, Euroclear put detailed proposals to Cedel which included a commitment to incorporate multiple exchange of files, seen as an important concession by Euroclear. One issue which has never failed to spark complaints in the AIBD's 23-year history is that of subscription rates. Under a proposed statute change, the flat fee, currently SFr6,000, would be substituted for a set range of SFr7,500 to SFr10,000. The change is part of an attempt to improve the limitation of liability of individual members to claims against the association by limiting liability to the annual subscription rate. However fees have frequently been a contentious issue, last leading to strong objections at the AIBD's Dallas meeting in 1988, when members complained they were subsidising the development of Trax, the AIBD's screen-based reporting system. Because the AIBD has a strong UK membership, and is a self-regulatory body under UK law, continental European members have often complained they were financing UK members' compliance with UK regulations. Now that Trax is running, and the commercial operations of the AIBD are generating funds, there may be resistance to any increase in fees. But for most leading firms, the costs involved are not significant. The issue of cost has also arisen in the context of the meeting's location in Hong Kong this year. Some dealers said it made the conference too time-consuming and too expensive. Indeed, fears that a quorum might not be met have prompted proposals to increase the number of proxies. However, the choice of a more expensive location - along with some more important issues - have helped encourage firms to send more senior executives, while in previous years, junior traders without the authority to make decisions were sometimes sent. Discussions about any move towards live screen prices are unlikely to advance. Although this is felt to be a likely development in the longer term, the daily feeds which the AIBD provides seem to be considered satisfactory. The expense and the complexity of developing live screen prices in Eurobonds are a deterrent, but such a shift also runs counter to some strong vested interests within the Eurobond market. Some banks feel their ability to trade profitably would be compromised by too much transparency.</p>

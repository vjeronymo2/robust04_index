			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Twelve divided on the future of energy tax EC FINANCE ministers last night dealt a severe blow to prospects for an EC-wide energy tax to fight global warming, which they refused to endorse after rows about how to share the burden of the levy. The failure leaves in doubt the EC's ability to fulfil its commitments under the Rio climate change convention, and marks a reverse for Germany, Denmark, Italy and the Benelux countries. They had all but signed up to the tax plan and based their national programmes for the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions on the assumption it would become EC law. In March they warned their partners that the year-end deadline for ratifying the Rio convention could not be met unless the tax was in place. They contend that the EC commitment to stabilise CO emissions at 1990 levels by 2000 is not possible without the EC-wide tax, necessary, moreover, to avoid distortions in Europe's single market if member states go ahead with their own eco-taxes. In the draft endorsement of the tax the current Danish EC presidency failed to get agreed, it had stressed the competition distortions which would follow a failure to agree a Community emissions strategy. The UK made clear yesterday it is still not convinced of the need for a Euro-energy tax and, along with France, queried the 'burden-sharing' formula which all but the UK agreed to in April. In order to win the support of poorer member states, that formula agreed to take into account levels of economic development and different levels of CO emissions in distributing the energy tax burden. Ms Marianne Jelved, the Danish economy minister who chaired yesterday's meeting, insisted the tax 'is certainly not a project which is dead', arguing that public pressure and the need to preserve the integrity of the single market would see it through in the end. The Belgian presidency, which takes office in July, is planning a joint meeting of finance and environment ministers for the autumn. Separately, the ministers agreed in principle yesterday on an Ecu1bn (Pounds 790m) loan for eastern European nations and former Soviet republics to upgrade safety at their nuclear plants. The loan, to be provided under the aegis of Euratom, the EC nuclear energy agency, is on top of already committed EC aid for nuclear safety in the east of Ecu330m, about 60 per cent of total assistance from the Group of 24 industrialised nations.</p>

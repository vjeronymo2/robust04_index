			<p><P> July 14, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY: CONSUMER NEWS  </P> <P> Eye Drug Recalled: The Food and Drug Administration is recalling the  prescription eye drug Opticrom, a solution of cromolyn sodium sold in  10-milliliter bottles, citing the threat of potentially blinding bacterial  infection. FDA officials said Fisons Corp. of Rochester, N.Y., is voluntarily  pulling the drug off the market after tests showed that two lots -- stamped  KF7A and KF35V -- may be contaminated with bacteria that can cause  vision-threatening infections in people whose eyes are scratched or damaged.  Bottles with those two lot numbers should be returned to pharmacies, the FDA  said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 10, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOLLYWOOD AND BLACK AMERICANS  </P> <P> Writer Stein makes a good point when he describes Hollywood's reluctance to  cast black Americans in positive and inspirational roles. I agree totally and  would like to extend his point to include the responsibility of today's black  producers to generate movies with a positive and meaningful purpose.  </P> <P> On a recent trip to the movies I saw the film "Do the Right Thing," a movie  that has been mentioned as the best picture of the year. In my opinion this is  one of the all-time worst movies to come out of Hollywood. It is insulting and  degrading to the black community. I don't deny the existence of the black  experience the movie describes, but why must all our black-produced movies  bring the same negative message?  </P> <P> If black producers can't come up with something positive from the black  American life style, how can we expect others to do so? I believe our black  producers have a responsibility to present some of the positive experiences  that are occurring every day in the black American life style.  </P> <P> RAYMOND M. STEWART  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / People: Kenneth Baker joins Hanson board Kenneth Baker, the former Conservative home secretary, has been slower than some of his ex-cabinet colleagues to pick up new interests now that he is free from ministerial office. However, he has made up for the delay with his first appointment, a non-executive directorship of Hanson, Britain's ninth biggest company. Lord Hanson, who has better political contacts with the Conservative party than have many big businessmen, yesterday said he was delighted that Baker, 57, had agreed to join his board. Over the past year Hanson has been under pressure to strengthen its team of non-executive directors and Baker's appointment fills an obvious gap on a board which is dominated by executive directors and businessmen. Baker, who entered parliament in 1968 and remains MP for Mole Valley, has held a wide variety of ministerial posts. Between 1981 and 1984 he was minister of state at the Department of Industry. He then moved to the Department of Environment as minister for local government, and in May 1986 was appointed secretary of state for education and science. In July 1989 he was made chairman of the Conservative party but retained his cabinet seat. He decided to leave the government after the 1992 election. He said yesterday that Hanson was 'one of the most successful and well-managed companies in the world' and he was 'very pleased' to have been asked to join its board. ***** Viscountess Cobham, who has first-hand experience of restoring the family seat, has been hired as special adviser on heritage and tourism for David Mellor's new Department of National Heritage. Lady Cobham was a member of the English Tourist Board and a commissioner of English Heritage and of the Countryside Commission. She is on the Historic Royal Palaces Advisory Group, the British Tourist Authority's British Heritage Committee and the Historic Houses Association's Executive Council. Lady Cobham has lived at Hagley Hall (left), the family's Grade I English Palladian house in the west midlands, since 1974 when she married the 11th viscount. During this time she has supervised the structural and decorative renovation of the property and organised the opening of the house to the public. Her work at Hagley was recognised by an award from the British Tourist Authority.</p>

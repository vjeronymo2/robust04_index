			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / Money, kids and family rows: Debate at the UN's population summit is about how, not whether, to curb growth in numbers In the past two years Dr Nafis Sadik has travelled to more than 150 countries, some more than once, while preparing to chair the United Nations' conference on population and development which begins in Cairo on Monday. Her grandson, she says, assumes she must have a tyrannical boss who orders her to travel constantly. Dr Sadik is amused by the irony, as the conference's aim - and the target of bitter attacks from governments and religious groups - is to give women more control over their lives. This weekend, as more than 10,000 delegates, lobbyists and journalists from 170 countries gather in the African continent's most populous city, battle lines have been drawn. In an unlikely alliance against the UN's draft policy document, Pope John Paul II has accused the conference of promoting abortion as a means of contraception, while Egypt's Al-Azhar University mosque, influential in the Moslem world, has criticised the draft agenda for condoning homosexuality, pre-marital and adolescent sex. Apparently moved by such concerns, Saudi Arabia and Sudan, both Moslem countries, have announced they are boycotting the conference. The decision of Turkey's prime minister, Tancu Ciller, and Bangladesh's prime minister, Ms Begum Khaleda Zia, not to attend may also have been influenced by the mounting religious opposition. Such reactions are unsurprising: the issues bring to the fore the sorest divisions between governments, cultures and religions. Two years ago, Britain's Prince Charles accused the Rio Earth Summit of ducking population control and contraception issues because of their contentiousness, despite their relevance to environmental concerns. Yet Cairo opens with a greater level of international consensus on the desirability of lower birth rates than was imaginable 10 years ago at the UN's last population conference in Mexico. This partly reflects a new recognition of the scale of the problem. The UNFPA - the UN population fund, of which Dr Sadik is executive director - estimates the world's population will nearly double to 10bn from 5.7bn by the middle of next century. In the light of such projections, many African countries, which appeared uninterested in curbing population growth a decade ago, have undergone a sea change in attitude. Part of the reason has been the impact of rapid population growth on over-stretched health and education plans. Moreover, some such as Dr Fred Sai, Ghanaian president of the International Planned Parenthood Federation, which promotes family planning services around the world, argue overcrowding has been a factor in Rwanda's turmoil. But the greater consensus also reflects a new confidence among countries that family planning can work. That optimism is based on the sharp falls in fertility rates - the average number of children borne by a woman - in most developing countries since the Mexico conference. To demographers' surprise, rates have fallen even where economic development has been slow, confounding conventional wisdom. Easy access to contraception (see chart) is one of the most important factors leading to smaller families, experts now argue. Countries which have not shown such declines in fertility rates and are still ambivalent or sceptical about family planning tend to be relatively affluent with small populations, particularly Moslem countries in north Africa and the Gulf. But even Pakistan, which for years made little attempt to curb high fertility rates, has recently begun to promote family planning programmes vigorously. Despite the new agreement on goals, however, there is still wide disagreement about how to get there. Cairo delegates expect fierce debate on two fronts: the final wording of the UNFPA's policy guidelines on family planning; and its proposal that financial support for family planning should treble to Dollars 17bn a year by the year 2000. The UNFPA wants at least a quarter of this funding to be supplied as international aid, the rest via national programmes. In the countdown to Cairo, the noisiest criticism has centred on how the final text will view abortion. Dr Sadik, who calls the row a 'red herring', believes the Vatican is using the issue of abortion to rally support for its opposition to any contraception. She points out the draft agenda mentions abortion only as a threat to women's health; the UNFPA estimates 250,000 women a year die from badly-performed operations. The UNFPA is currently barred from promoting abortion or helping doctors perform the operation, even where a lack of medical skill endangers women's lives. She says the conference 'should accommodate the Vatican only as one state which speaks for 800 people, not for the 1bn Catholics of the world, most of whom are not behind their church on contraception'. Behind that headline-grabbing row, however, many religious groups as well as governments have begun to show a wider unease about the agenda's proposals for improving sex education for teenagers, and for more general education for women and girls. The Iranian Health Minister, Mr Ali Reza Marandi, has criticised the conference for 'ignoring Islamic values' and promoting 'sexual liberty'. According to Dr Sadik, 'in the preparatory committee meetings, every government wholeheartedly endorsed empowerment of women, outdoing even the language of women's groups. But now they are starting to recognise what it means'. As well as trying to settle such controversial points, governments will have to tackle the funding question. It will hardly be plain sailing. Some developing countries are wary of having to adopt western values to receive international aid. Others are concerned that some of the western contribution to total funding will be taken out of other aid budgets. According to Dr Sadik: 'I will not count it as failure if we don't get it (the Dollars 17bn), but I will be very disappointed.' But however stormy next week's debate becomes, it is population growth, not the Cairo agenda, which presents governments with difficult choices. On the one hand, if they tolerate present fertility rates, they face the threat of social disruption: strains on natural resources will increase and people will leave the countryside in search of jobs in crowded cities. If they need any reminder of those threats, China provides a graphic example: even though the Beijing government has taken tough measures to bring down family size, a projection two weeks ago estimated half of its population would be living in cities by 2010, against less than a third today. On the other hand, if governments promote easier access to contraception, they can expect big changes in women's social role. Those are, notably for conservative countries, uncomfortable options. But however many amendments are made to the Cairo agenda, demographers' arithmetic shows governments cannot expect their societies to stay the same.</p>

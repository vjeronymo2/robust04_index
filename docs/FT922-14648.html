			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / International Company News: Tobishima agrees new debt plan TOBISHIMA Corporation, a leading Japanese contractor and developer, has announced that a plan to reduce its Y1,000bn (Dollars 749.6m) in group debt has failed, and that a new five-year scheme, including an indefinite cut in interest rates, has been approved by its main bank, Fuji Bank. The plight of Tobishima, once renowned for railway and power plant construction, but now a victim of its speculative property developments, highlights the importance of the main bank relationship in Japan. Its debt-shuffling method of holding off collapse is common to other Japanese companies facing stock and property losses. Last June, Tobishima announced a three-year debt restructuring plan in which it would offload property holdings, but the weak property market forced it to shift assets and debts around group companies, with the result that total debt has risen from Y930bn in March last year to Y1,000bn. However, the new scheme, overseen by two former Fuji Bank executives, also involves a significant amount of debt shuffling. Most of the burden will be assumed by Nihon Kaiser, a concrete slab maker in which Tobishima has a 19 per cent stake, and which is run by a nephew of Mr Hitoshi Tobishima, the contractor's president. Mr Tobishima, 79, resumed as president last year after having forced his son, Akira, to resign. Akira had authorised a spate of US purchases and had wanted to develop an international chain of five-star hotels. Under the plan, Tobishima will transfer Y430bn of its debt to a subsidiary, Tobishima Urban Development, giving it a total of Y790b in debt, and reducing the parent's exposure to Y210bn. At the same time, ownership of Tobishima Urban will be transferred to Nihon Kaiser. Tobishima is also trying to distance itself from Tobishima Urban and the large debt in an attempt to take pressure off its share price, which yesterday fell Y71 to Y535. The fall followed news that construction orders were sharply lower than expected, with sales in the year to end-March forecast at Y460bn, down from a previous estimate of Y530bn. The contractor said that Fuji Bank, which has a 4.8 per cent stake in Tobishima, and about 80 other banks have agreed to reduce the interest on its debt from about 6.5 per cent to 3 per cent this year, while Tobishima Urban's interest rate is likely to be cut to 1 per cent, indefinitely. The success of the plan depends on a recovery in the Japanese property market, and Tobishima says the 1 per cent interest rate will be reviewed as holdings are sold off. The company has sold its Tokyo headquarters, near the Imperial Palace, but the buyer was another member of the same group. For the fiscal year just ended, the company expects to report an after-tax loss of Y45bn, including write-offs from the overhaul of a Japanese and a US subsidiary, and Y13.3bn in losses from a Los Angeles building project. Pre-tax profit is estimated at Y1bn, down from a forecast of Y5bn.</p>

			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Output up 1.3% in quarter: Pharmaceuticals and furniture rise while footwear declines Production of cars, pharmaceuticals, plastic packaging and furniture rose in May, while footwear and ship-building dipped slightly, official figures showed yesterday. Overall, industrial output showed a healthy 1.3 per cent growth in the three months to May compared with the three months to February, and a 4.6 per cent growth over the same period a year ago, the Central Statistical Office said. On a monthly basis output rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.3 per cent between April and May. This growth rate was slower than in April, when output unexpectedly surged 1.6 per cent on the month. The figure was in line with City expectations, however, and analysts yesterday welcomed it as evidence of a healthily steady industrial recovery. They pointed out that, if April's surge had been repeated in May, this might have prompted fears that the industrial recovery was overheating and fuelling inflationary pressures. Within the quarterly figures, manufacturing rose 1.2 per cent in the three months to May compared with the previous three months. Meanwhile oil and gas continued to boost the production figures, as a collection of new North Sea fields came on stream in recent months. Although oil and gas production dipped slightly in May because of an accident on the Piper Alpha field it is now running 39.6 per cent higher than in the same period a year ago. Across other sectors the manufacturing rise was fairly broadly based, suggesting that the recovery is feeding through to all stages in the industrial supply chain. The output of the investment goods industry rose 1.5 per cent in the three months to May, compared with the previous three months, while consumer goods output rose 1 per cent. Intermediate goods industries, which supply manufacturers with their energy, components and raw materials, rose 1.4 per cent in the same period. Pharmaceuticals performed particularly well, rising 3 per cent, quarter on quarter. The plastics packaging business - often a key to signs of recovery in other manufacturing areas - rose 4 per cent in the same period. Furniture and car production also showed healthy rises, while electrical and optical equipment manufacturers were the best performing engineering sector, rising 3.3 per cent in the three months to May compared with the previous quarter. The CSO said this growth had been boosted by particularly strong output in the computer, telephone and electrical goods industry. Footwear production, however, fell 5 per cent in the quarter. The shipbuilding and aerospace industries continued to report a slowdown, with the output of both categories running 10 per cent lower than in the previous year.</p>

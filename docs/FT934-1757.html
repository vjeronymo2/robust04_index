			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Fiat to stop selling Lancia cars Fiat is to stop selling its Lancia cars in the UK and phase out production of right-hand drive Lancia models. The decision marks the defeat of Fiat's decade-long struggle to revive the marque's fortunes in the UK, after sales were devastated by a controversy over rusting at the end of the 1970s. At their peak in 1978 Lancia sales reached 11,800. But allegations a year later of excessive rust in the then best-selling Beta model badly damaged the marque's reputation, in spite of Fiat buying back cars from dissatisfied owners. Since then sales have declined inexorably. In 1989 - the record year for total car sales - they were down to just over 3,000. Last year they totalled only 701, and up to last night 569 had been sold this year. Fiat Auto (UK), the Fiat parent, said last night that it was contacting all Lancia owners to assure them of continuing service, parts and warranty assistance. Lancia owners with vehicles registered since August 1990 are also being issued with a coupon worth up to Pounds 1,600, redeemable on either a new Fiat or Alfa Romeo, another marque owned by the Fiat group. Most of the 46 Lancia dealers, which are on 12-month contracts, have a dual franchise with Fiat, whose own sales have risen by more than one third, from 31,000 last year to 42,000 so far this year. Some dealers will be offered the Alfa Romeo franchise as a Lancia substitute. Before the rust scare the UK was Lancia's largest right-hand drive market. Its collapse has significantly reduced the incentive for Fiat to keep right-hand drive cars in production. The Irish Republic, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Singapore, Cyprus and some African and Pacific rim markets have accounted for a small volume of sales but future Lancias will not be engineered for such markets.</p>

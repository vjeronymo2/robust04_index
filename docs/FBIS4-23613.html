			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with interim President Theodore Sindikubwabo by </F> unidentified correspondent; place and date not given--recorded]    [Text] [Sindikubwabo] We tried to convey the fact that the  RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front], which has attacked Rwanda is  supported by foreign powers, by a neighboring country, namely  Uganda. We want this to be clear and the African countries or  other people who want to know the truth to realize that, without  Uganda, without the support, material help, and the contribution  of men from Uganda, the RPF would not exist any longer.    [Correspondent] However, President Museveni is not mentioned  in this declaration.    [Sindikubwabo] We are used to this type of behavior and, on  this subject, on the subject of this cooperation, I would also  like to be clear: We are not calling for the condemnation of  President Museveni as such, we are calling for the condemnation  of the actions that Uganda carries out when it arms our  aggressors, when it supplies them with men because, if you  remember correctly what President Museveni recently said one day  in Oslo: He said that it was young Ugandans who were fighting  with the RPF.    Is there further evidence? There is also further evidence --  our government filed a complaint with the UN Security Council  and evidence was gathered. They now hold the following  evidence: We have the identity cards of those Ugandans who have  fallen on the battle field; Ugandan vehicles that have been  seized on the front were seized by the Rwandan forces -- this is  sufficient evidence.    [Correspondent] You came to Tunis via Zaire. You went via  Goma. Have you met President Mobutu?    [Sindikubwabo] No, I met the prime minister. He has known  the situation for a long time, since 1990. He knows what is  happening in Rwanda.    [Correspondent] Do you intend to meet President Mobutu here?  Do you intend to ask him for diplomatic help? For proud action?  For help together with that of other heads of state?    [Sindikubwabo] I will ask what I will ask from other heads  of  state: What I will ask from other well-meaning people is more  peace and truth; to have the international community know  exactly what is happening in Rwanda, what the reasons behind  this war are, who is fuelling this war, and to ask them to stop,  so that the RPF can lay down their weapons, and so that we can  meet around a table to start a dialogue.    [Correspondent] What stage have negotiations reached now?  Which conditions should be met in order to put an end to the  bloodbath which is taking place in Rwanda now, given that the  two sides are still fighting?    [Sindikubwabo] We called for a cease-fire from the RPF and  they refused to stop fighting. What we are calling for is a  cease-fire so that we can -- not renegotiate, since negotiations  are behind us -- but see what the stumbling blocks are.    [Correspondent] Should the transitional authorities, which  were appointed at Arusha, be accepted by the RPF, would you be  ready to leave power?    [Sindikubwabo] What we are ready to do is to respect the  Arusha accords. There is a chapter on the sharing of power. We  are ready to share. We agreed to do so, and we still agree to  that. The RPF should not ask for the resignation of this  government. We are not recognized by the RPF and we are not  asking the RPF to recognize us. Has anyone recognized the RPF?  They do not exist by law. We exist according to one law, our  basic law.</p>

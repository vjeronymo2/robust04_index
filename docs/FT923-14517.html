			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Leading Article: A beleaguered government IT'S A funny old world, as Mr Major's predecessor remarked after her abrupt exit from office. Three months ago, Mr Major was a hero to his party. Now his supporters are fretful about the Maastricht Treaty and, still more, about the economy. People even ask whether UK membership of the exchange rate mechanism, Mr Major's most important decision, was not a mistake. The questioning is unsurprising. The latest consensus of forecasts is for UK economic growth between 1991 and 1992 of only 0.4 per cent. Last December, by contrast, growth was expected to be 1.8 per cent. This collapse in the forecast parallels what happened last year, when what turned out to be a decline of 2.2 per cent had been forecast the previous December as growth of 0.3 per cent. No growth at all this year, and perhaps a decline, are plausible. The consensus forecast for growth of 2 1/2 per cent between 1992 and 1993 could also end up as optimistic. Consider what even the current consensus would mean. Between 1986, when the economy was start-ing to take off, and 1993, when the economy is at present expected to recover, growth would have averaged 1.8 per cent a year. All that those years of low growth would have achieved is a reduction in retail price inflation from 3.7 per cent between 1985 and 1986, to the forecast level of 3 1/2 per cent in the year to the fourth quarter of 1993. True, inflation might be lower than that next year, even substantially lower, but only if economic growth were also still less. Painful side effects This is not all. Recession has had painful side effects, among them the deterioration of the public finances. The public sector borrowing requirement could be much more than 5 per cent of gross domestic product this year and still more thereafter. So healthy were the UK's public finances at the end of the 1980s that some years of heavy borrowing can be contemplated. But in the end deficits on this scale will destroy the credibility of the exchange rate policy on which the government has set its heart. Mistakes have been made. Yet current policy could still pass the 'Bundesbank test', this being whether the German central bank would adopt current UK monetary policy if it were to be directly, instead of only indirectly, responsible for that lumbering beast. Faced with an economy 'bumping along the bottom', but with underlying inflation running at about 5 per cent a year and earnings at 7 per cent, though both on a declining trend, the Bundesbank might retain short interest rates at 10 per cent. The question is for how long it would do so. Contrary to government propaganda, low inflation does not guarantee a recovery. Lower inflation normally produces recovery, because it allows substantial reductions in short-term interest rates. Remote chances The chances of lower British interest rates depend on Germany. But every piece of news on German monetary overshooting and the resilience of the German economy makes the chances of marked monetary easing look more remote. If German rates stay up, the more successful the UK turns out to be in lowering its inflation, the higher will real interest rates become. For an economy in the midst of debt-deflation, this is alarming. The nature of the danger is revealed by the US, with official short-term rates of interest at 3 per cent, and Australia, with rates of 6.5 per cent. Both countries share the British debt problem; both have far more expansion-ary monetary policies; both are making only modest recoveries, nevertheless. Unhappily, all options are dismal. These are to: soldier on, hoping that the economy will soon turn up or German interest rates turn down; seek a realignment, which would probably lead to higher UK interest rates and, unless substantial, would give only a modest boost to economic activity; quit the ERM, which would leave the government without a monetary policy and be like a nuclear bomb landed on top of its European policy as well; and push for the earliest possible move to economic and monetary union, with a central bank that would look at the European economy as a whole, not just one region of it. Given the nature of the alternatives, there can be no question of changing policy today. A government dedicated to lower inflation could also justify its current policies, even if it were not constrained by the ERM. But how long could it do so? The answer must depend both on what happens to the economy and on the costs of any policy change. Since the point of entering the ERM was to put the UK in a straitjacket, it is not surprising to find that it is indeed in one. The patient has derived some benefit from the treatment. The question is how long the UK will bear to wear it.</p>

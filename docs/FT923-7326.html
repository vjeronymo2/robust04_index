			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / International Company News: Air Canada in link-up with United Airlines AIR CANADA, frustrated in its second attempt to take over its rival Canadian Airlines International, has turned to United Airlines of the US for a commercial alliance. The operational link-up, which becomes effective on October 25, will improve service and cut connection time at the airlines' hubs in North America, Europe, Latin America and the Pacific. An equity link is not planned. The two airlines will merge their frequent-flyer programmes and co-operate in computer reservation systems and marketing. United, four times the size of Air Canada, said further benefits would come to both airlines from the 'open skies' agreement being negotiated by Canada and the US. This will allow limited entry of US airlines to the Canadian domestic market and greater access for Canadian carriers to the huge US market. Air Canada had a first-half loss of CDollars 293m (USDollars 246.2m), or Dollars 3.96 a share, including restructuring charges. Second-quarter traffic rose 14 per cent, but with larger capacity its yields fell. Canadian is now considering an offer from its employees to put up CDollars 200m in new equity.</p>

			<p><P> November 17, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION DIVISION VIII FOOTBALL PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> LAGUNA HILLS WINS ON FINAL PLAY  </P> <P> Fullback Mark Mitchell, who had fumbled the ball away at the Yucaipa 12-yard  line on a previous drive, scored the winning touchdown with no time remaining  to give Laguna Hills a 16-13 victory over previously undefeated Yucaipa in the  Division VIII playoffs Thursday night at the University of Redlands.  </P> <P> However, it wasn't Mitchell's dive off left tackle that was special, but the  way the Hawks (6-5) got to the end zone.  </P> <P> The Hawks got the ball back after Mitchell's fumble with 1:58 left at their 48.  </P> <P> Five plays later, quarterback Mark Wells ran out of bounds at the Yucaipa six  with 52 seconds left. Then Yucaipa's perfect season collapsed under a hail of  penalties.  </P> <P> Luis Fino was called for a face mask violation. Then cornerback Wes Samuelsen  was called for pass interference in the end zone with seven seconds left.  </P> <P> On the next play, Samuelsen was called for holding on Wells' keeper as time ran  out. That set the stage for Mitchell's plunge from the one with no time left.  </P> <P> Mitchell had scored on a one-yard run to cut a Yucaipa lead to 13-10 after  starting tailback Marwan Saba was taken off the field with a dislocated elbow.  Saba, who gained 165 yards in 23 carries, was submarined by Yucaipa's Beau  Smith with 10:51 left.  </P> <P> But until the final drive, Laguna Hills' luck was all bad.  </P> <P> Marc Brodbeck missed a 39-yard field goal. Laguna Hills also had a first  quarter 18-yard touchdown pass from Wells to Darrin Chapman called back because  of a holding penalty.  </P> <P> Then Yucaipa (10-1)scored its second touchdown after a fluke pass play gave the  Thunderbirds the ball at the Laguna Hills' 15. The score was set up by a  32-yard pass from Bob Taylor to Sean Arend. Laguna Hills coach Steve Bresnahan  argued that Arend was a "sleeper receiver" and had not stood within 15 yards of  the huddle as the pass was being called.  </P> <P> Then, Taylor hit Todd Lemanski for a 15-yard touchdown pass to give Yucaipa a  13-3 lead.  </P></p>

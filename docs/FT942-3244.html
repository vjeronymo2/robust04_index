			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets: Helsinki down 2% in Nordic slip Nordic markets, early closers by and large, derived little benefit from yesterday's European bond market recovery, writes William Cochrane. The exception was Stockholm, which came back from an early fall of 1.2 per cent to end with the OMX index a token 2.26 higher at 1,102.05. Helsinki took a 2 per cent tumble, the Hex index closing 33.7 lower at 1,657.8 as more results, particularly from Valmet, the engineering company, and Rautaruukki, the steel group, failed to impress the market  - the shares dropped FM12 to FM84 and FM3.50 to FM42 respectively. Copenhagen reversed its recent recovery, with the blue chip KFX index losing 1.43 at 103.61 and Oslo's all-share index hitting a new 1994 low of 599.33 before closing 8.82 off at 600.75. Mr Peter Tron at Unibank said that liquidity had been a major concern: in Norway, due to Norsk Hydro's NKr4.8bn rights issue; in Sweden, fielding the Pharmacia privatisation; in Denmark, with the debut of Tele Danmark; and in Finland, where Nokia, a star performer, will soon be looking for more than FM4bn. The region, said Mr Tron, had also been depressed by bond market weakness since February 4: in Sweden, six-month rates rose from 6.9 to 7.1 per cent over the period; in Norway, they moved up from 4.91 to 5.24 per cent; and in Finland they jumped from 4.56 to 5.31 per cent, the price for letting the economy rip after a major devaluation.</p>

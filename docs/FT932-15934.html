			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Arts: Ballet on the doorstep - The ENB's regional tours English National Ballet makes an amoeba-like split for the next month to encompass two small-scale tours of the regions. The scheme is of proven value as we know from previous years. Audiences that might not expect to see ballet of this quality on their doorsteps, benefit. New work is encouraged without prohibitive cost. The dead hand of the 'classics' is lifted from the box-office. Dancers find new roles and challenges. All's for the best, and if - as on Tuesday night in High Wycombe - some of the programme is a bit below par, there are rewards in seeing dancers blossom in a fresh repertory. ENB was appearing in High Wycombe at the new (November 1992) Swan Theatre. The building is light, spacious, well-planned. Civilised loos. The auditorium seats just over a thousand in comfort. Sight lines are good; the stage is excellent for middle-scale dance; the theatre and bar staff are courteous and seem actually to care that the public is present. (So unlike certain of our own dear metropolitan fun-palaces.) The key to the programme was the first performance of The Seven Silences of Salome - over-sibilant title - by the Portuguese choreographer Olga Roriz, who made an impressive Thirteen Gestures of the Body for the Gulbenkian Ballet. This is bare-foot territory - as was everything in the evening except for the Don Quixote duet - and the piece comes with an addled programme-note which avers that the seven men in the cast are 'multiple images of John the Baptist' who dance their individual tributes to Salome, and that the whole thing is 'a dream developed by a woman about the desire of another woman who has never existed'. After that, I would happily believe that Mme Roriz was also laying claim to the throne of Peru. It is intellectual hocus-pocus. What we see is seven men who dress up in seven items of flimsy female clothing (they look foolish enough to appear on the cat-walk of almost any British fashion show) and then perform brief, vivid solos. Salome does not appear. The value of the piece is that Mme Roriz offers an individual and convincing dance-language which gives the men splendid opportunities. Movement is anxious, feverish, built upon quick, bright gesture and jagged-edged action. Performances are fine, committed. The men are Alexis Manuel, Paul Lewis, Denzil Bailey (who has a variation of great rhythmic sophistication, which he does admirably well), Maurizio Bellezza, Tim Almaas, Thomas Edur and Stephen Sherriff. I thought Mr Sherriff extraordinary, even in this distinguished company, by reason of the emotional concentration of his playing. He has, from his days as a soloist with the Royal Ballet, been an artist to watch with gratitude. Here he achieves even more impressive stature: the role, the dance, take fire. This Salome is a welcome arrival in the repertory showing the men of the troupe as serious and gifted artists. There is an insistently clangorous electronic score by Antonio Emiliano; simple and effective decor by Nuno Carinhas. Sponsorship comes from Portugal 600. American choreographies framed the programme: Paul Taylor's Aureole, which no one on stage understood, for performances were neither buoyant enough nor exact enough in gesture; and David Parson's two jokes, Sleep Study and The Envelope. The pyjama-ed figures of the first are quite amusing, the piece happily brief; the romping of the second goes on for ever. Hero of this was the pianist Kevin Darvas who played a Rossini mish-mash with a nice wit. In the Don Quixote pas de deux, Agnes Oaks and Thomas Edur did what they did efficiently. Neither convinced me and Mr Edur is too valuable an artist to be wasted on this horse-play. ENB's tours Britain with two programmes until May 8.</p>

			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / International Company News: Another US retailer bites the dust ANOTHER sizeable US retailer bit the dust yesterday. as New York-based Alexander's closed the doors of its 11 department stores - all in the metropolitan New York region - and announced that they would not reopen. The company itself filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code, and will now attempt to reorganise as a property company. In the mid-1980s, annual turnover at Alexander's topped Dollars 500m, and until recently the stores group employed over 7,000 people. Alexander's move comes amid some signs of improved consumer spending levels in the US. However, the company has been making losses for years; in the last 24 months alome, the deficit from retail operations reached Dollars 40m, and management said yesterday that the losses were projected to continue. The chain was once viewed as a 'middle market' operator competing with the likes of Macy's and Gimbels. Some of its store sites are still fairly attractive, including one on Lexington Avenue, a stone's throw from Bloomingdale's. At one stage, Donald Trump acquired a 27.2 per cent stake in the company, but this was subsequently repossessed by his bank lenders, led by Citicorp.</p>

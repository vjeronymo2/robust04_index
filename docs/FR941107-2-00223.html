			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Limiting the movement and transport of patients infected with virulent or epidemiologically important microorganisms and ensuring that such patients leave their rooms only for essential purposes reduce opportunities for transmission of microorganisms in hospitals. When patient transport is necessary, it is important that (1) appropriate barriers (e.g., masks, impervious dressings) are worn or used by the patient to reduce the opportunity for transmission of pertinent microorganisms to other patients, personnel, and visitors and to reduce contamination of the environment, (2) personnel in the area to which the patient is to be taken are notified of the impending arrival of the patient and of the precautions to be used to reduce the risk of transmission of infectious microorganisms, and (3) patients are informed of ways by which they can assist in preventing the transmission of their infectious microorganisms to others.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Masks, Respiratory Protection, Eye Protection, Face Shields  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Various types of masks, goggles, and face shields are worn alone or in combination to provide barrier protection. A mask that covers both the nose and mouth and goggles or a face shield are worn during procedures and patient-care activities that are likely to generate splashes or sprays of blood, body fluids, secretions, or excretions to provide protection of the mucous membranes of the eyes, nose, and mouth from contact transmission of pathogens. The wearing of masks, eye protection, and face shields in specified circumstances to reduce the risk of exposures to bloodborne pathogens is mandated by the OSHA bloodborne pathogens final rule. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 51 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A surgical mask is generally worn to provide protection against spread of infectious large-particle droplets that are transmitted by close contact and generally travel only short distances (up to 3 feet) from infected patients who are coughing or sneezing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An area of major concern and controversy over the last several years has been the role and selection of respiratory protection equipment and the implications of a respiratory protection program for prevention of transmission of tuberculosis in hospitals. Traditionally, although the efficacy was not proven, a surgical mask was worn for isolation precautions in hospitals when patients were known or suspected to be infected with pathogens spread by the airborne route of transmission. In 1990, however, the CDC tuberculosis guidelines <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 18 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  stated that surgical masks may not be effective in preventing the inhalation of droplet nuclei and recommended the use of disposable particulate respirators despite the fact that the efficacy of particulate respirators in protecting persons for the inhalation of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Mycobacterium tuberculosis  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> had not been demonstrated. By definition, particulate respirators include dust-mist (DM), dust-fume-mist (DFM), or high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter respirators certified by the CDC National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH); since the generic term particulate respirator was used in the 1990 guidelines, the implication was that any of these respirators provided sufficient protection. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 79 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1993, a draft revision of the CDC tuberculosis guidelines <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 22 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  outlined performance criteria for respirators and stated that some DM or DFM respirators might not meet these criteria. After review of public comments, the guidelines were finalized in October 1994 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 23 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  with the draft respirator criteria unchanged. The only class of respirators that currently are (1) known to consistently meet or exceed the performance criteria outlined in the 1994 tuberculosis guidelines, and (2) certified by NIOSH (as required by OSHA) are HEPA filter respirators. However, recently NIOSH has announced that they will change their respirator certification process. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 80 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The proposed changes should enable users to select from a broader range of certified respirators for use in hospitals for protection against  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Additional information on the evolution of respirator recommendations, regulations to protect hospital personnel, and the role of various federal agencies in respiratory protection for hospital personnel has been prepared for publication. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 79 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IT'S UNBRIDLED, NOT UNBEATEN;  </P> <P> HORSE RACING: COLT SHOWS HIS IMPROVEMENT SINCE BLUE GRASS WITH 3 1/2-LENGTH  VICTORY OVER SUMMER SQUALL. MISTER FRISKY IS EIGHTH, 19 1/4 LENGTHS BACK.  </P> <P> Unbridled, the unappreciated, won the 116th running of the Kentucky Derby  Saturday, soundly beating Summer Squall and Mister Frisky, two more glamorous  horses that sniffed the lilies instead of the roses at Churchill Downs.  </P> <P> Mister Frisky, undefeated in 16 races, which made him the most successful Derby  starter ever, was sent off as the 19-10 favorite. Then he became the 11th  consecutive public choice to fail here. The Santa Anita Derby winner had the  lead briefly on the far turn before he faltered, finishing eighth in the  15-horse field, 19 1/4 lengths behind Unbridled.  </P> <P> Summer Squall, who had won seven of eight races, was the 2-1 second choice of  the crowd of 128,257, and while giving a better account of himself than Mister  Frisky, he was no match for Unbridled when the telltale running began. Summer  Squall finished second, 3 1/2 lengths back and added to jockey Pat Day's legacy  in the Derby.  </P> <P> Day, who has won more races than anybody in the long history of Churchill  Downs, is winless in eight tries in the Derby. The frustration was compounded  Saturday, because Summer Squall gave Day an unprecedented three consecutive  second-place finishes, and Unbridled is a horse that Day rode as recently as  mid-March, when they won the Florida Derby.  </P> <P> Day also won a race at Gulfstream Park with Summer Squall that day, and said  after the Florida Derby that he was leaning toward Unbridled as his Kentucky  Derby horse. But after Summer Squall won the Jim Beam at Turfway Park two weeks  later, Day dropped his option on Unbridled, sending Saturday's winner back to  Craig Perret.  </P> <P> In the Blue Grass on a muddy track at Keeneland three weeks ago, Day rode  Summer Squall to another victory, with Unbridled and Perret finishing third, 3  3/4 lengths back.  </P> <P> Perret, 39, won on his fourth Derby mount, coming close with third-place Awe  Inspiring last year and with runner-up Bet Twice in 1987. Perret thought that  the Blue Grass was a useful race for Unbridled, and that it improved him about  four lengths -- or the distance needed to perhaps beat Summer Squall.  </P> <P> "I was wrong," Perret said Saturday. "After I worked him here, I felt that he  had moved up about eighth lengths. Our goal was not to win the Blue Grass, our  goal was to win the Derby."  </P> <P> Summer Squall finished six lengths ahead of Pleasant Tap, the 40-1 shot. It was  another three lengths back to Video Ranger, the horse from the $40,000 claiming  ranks who was 1 1/4 lengths better than Silver Ending, the Arkansas Derby  winner.  </P> <P> Reaching the wire, in order, after the first five were Killer Diller, Land  Rush, Mister Frisky, Thirty Six Red, Power Lunch, Real Cash, Dr. Bobby A.,  Pendleton Ridge, Burnt Hills and Fighting Fantasy. Country Day was scratched  from the Derby on Friday after fracturing a bone in his right foreleg.  </P> <P> Unbridled, the fifth betting choice, paid $23.60, $7.80 and $5.80. The other  mutuels were $3.80 and $3.80 on Summer Squall and $12 for Pleasant Tap.  Unbridled earned $581,000 of the $756,000 purse, running 1 1/4 miles in a  creditable time of 2:02 on a drying-out track that was labeled as good.  </P> <P> Unbridled, a big bay son of Fappiano and Gana Facil, is a Florida-bred who was  bought by his owner, Frances Genter, for $70,000 at Tartan Farms' dispersal  auction in 1987. Genter, 92, is a Minneapolis resident who has been in racing  for 53 years. Before Saturday, she said that her biggest racing thrill was  winning the 1951 Santa Anita Derby with Rough'n Tumble, a horse that cost  $5,000.  </P> <P> Carl Nafzger, 48, a former rodeo bull rider who started training quarter horses  in New Mexico in 1968 before moving to thoroughbreds a few years later, gave  Perret few prerace instructions.  </P> <P> "I only told Craig one thing," Nafzger said. "I wanted him to warm up the  horse, to jog him. I wanted him to trot the horse a whole bunch."  </P> <P> The jockey didn't have much to say to Nafzger, either. "If we just get that  much run, I know we'll win this race."  </P> <P> What Perret meant was shaking Unbridled loose in a large field. As it turned  out, the colt's only problem was a squeeze between Fighting Fantasy and  Pleasant Tap at the start.  </P> <P> "After three jumps, we were fine," Perret said.  </P> <P> Fighting Fantasy, who went off at 111-1, broke to the right, pushing Unbridled  into Pleasant Tap. Fighting Fantasy made the lead in the run past the stands  the first time, but dropped out of the race quickly.  </P> <P> Real Cash held the lead going down the backstretch, with Mister Frisky and his  jockey, Gary Stevens, running on his right flank. Thirty Six Red and Burnt  Hills also were in contention then, with Summer Squall heading up the second  tier of horses, about five lengths behind Real Cash. Unbridled was in sixth  place, about eight lengths away from the front.  </P> <P> On the far turn, Mister Frisky moved past Real Cash, but could hold the lead  for only about 10 jumps. Summer Squall and Unbridled were rolling even faster.  </P> <P> "I wasn't sure I could beat Pat at the five-sixteenths pole, but I knew then  that it was just me and him," Perret said.  </P> <P> Summer Squall moved past Mister Frisky, and Unbridled was accelerating right  behind him. With a half-mile to go, Unbridled was following Land Rush, and  Silver Ending was coming up on the outside. Perret was able to send Unbridled  through the hole that those horses might have closed.  </P> <P> "That was the key," Perret said. "The hole was there at the right time."  </P> <P> Unbridled, on the outside, pulled away from Summer Squall just inside the  eighth pole, completing the trip and the victory with only a couple of  right-handed whacks from Perret's whip.  </P> <P> "At the quarter pole, I saw Pat whipping his horse, and I said to myself, "Pat,  you're in trouble,' " Perret said. "From the middle of the backstretch, I knew  we were in good shape. I had a golden trip.  </P> <P> "Today was just my day at Churchill Downs. This horse gave me a winning race at  the eighth pole. I saw the progress he was making (since the Blue Grass). I  knew he was coming to the race in the right way."  </P> <P> Day didn't get his usual strong finish from Summer Squall.  </P> <P> "I looked over my shoulder just about the five-sixteenths pole and I saw  Unbridled coming," Day said. "When I looked back at my horse, he had his ears  straight up. I mean, we were on the lead at that point just turning into the  stretch, and he threw his ears up and just lost total concentration.  </P> <P> "When Unbridled came by me, my horse got back into it, but it wasn't the burst  that I anticipated that he was capable of. He came on down there with a  half-hearted run. I think that he was capable of a better finish than that.  </P> <P> "It wasn't like he was a tired horse, but he wasn't exerting 100% of his effort  at that point. My hat's off to the winner, but I think my colt could have made  it a bit more of a horse race if he had just maintained his attention span. He  just kind of lost his concentration momentarily at the head of the stretch and  just never seemed to regain it."  </P> <P> Perret rode Unbridled for the first time for a fifth-place finish in the  Tropical Park Derby at Calder in January. Jose Velez had been riding Unbridled  as a 2-year-old, but he broke his hip in a spill.  </P> <P> In the Fountain of Youth at Gulfstream on March 3, Day rode Unbridled for the  first time, because Perret was committed to Rhythm, the champion 2-year-old  colt. Unbridled finished third and Rhythm, who eventually dropped out of the  Kentucky Derby picture after throat surgery, was 10th.  </P> <P> Two weeks later, Unbridled's win in the Florida Derby was demeaned because of a  slow time and the fact that it was only the third victory in nine starts for  the colt. The Blue Grass, his next race, did nothing to swell Unbridled's  reputation, except in the eyes of Nafzger and Perret.  </P> <P> "They built a wall around Summer Squall and Mister Frisky (for the Kentucky  Derby)," Perret said. "I guess if you win all 16 of your races, you're entitled  to that, but I never felt this was a two-horse race. Quite a few horses in this  race had a license to win."  </P> <P> The overriding sentimental choice was Mister Frisky and trainer Laz Barrera,  who had won the Derby with Bold Forbes in 1976 and the Triple Crown with  Affirmed in 1978, before two heart surgeries and a dismissed California  accusation that he had run a horse on cocaine in 1988.  </P> <P> Barrera schooled Mister Frisky so much at Churchill Downs -- in the paddock and  in the starting gate -- that the colt might have been Phi Beta Kappa. Mister  Frisky, heated up and unruly before the Santa Anita Derby, was a model horse in  the paddock on Saturday.  </P> <P> "I hate to blame the track, but the horse didn't handle it," Stevens said.  "When we made the lead, I thought the race was ours. But when Summer Squall and  Unbridled started coming, my horse bobbled for three or four strides. He was  uncomfortable. He had done the same thing during a workout here, and I had said  something about it.  </P> <P> "After that, I asked him for his best, and it wasn't there. The last eighth of  a mile, I was more concerned about the well-being of the horse. I just took  care of him the rest of the way."  </P> <P> Barrera said that Mister Frisky suffered a cut on his right front ankle, but it  isn't serious. Stevens feels that Mister Frisky deserves another chance.  </P> <P> "He pulled up all right, and if he's all right after this, I'd like to see him  run in the Preakness," Stevens said.  </P> <P> The Preakness, the second leg in the Triple Crown, will be run at Pimlico on  May 19. Unbridled will not be unappreciated when he runs in that one.  </P> <P> * ADDITIONAL COVERAGE: C3  </P> <P> </P> <P> RECENT: WINNERS  </P> <P> Year: Horse  </P> <P> 1990: Unbridled  </P> <P> 1989: Sunday: Silence  </P> <P> 1988: Winning: Colors  </P> <P> 1987: Alysheba  </P> <P> 1986: Ferdinand  </P> <P> 1985: Spend: a: Buck  </P> <P> 1984: Swale  </P> <P> 1983: Sunny's: Halo  </P> <P> 1982: Gato: del: Sol  </P> <P> 1981: Pleasant: Colony  </P> <P> 1980: Genuine: Risk  </P> <P> 1979: Spectacular: Bid  </P> <P> 1978: Affirmed  </P> <P> 1977: Seattle: Slew  </P> <P> 1976: Bold: Forbes  </P> <P> 1975: Foolish: Pleasure  </P> <P> 1974: Cannonade  </P> <P> 1973: Secretariat  </P> <P> </P> <P> DERBY WINNERS  </P> <P> Year: Horse  </P> <P> 1990: Unbridled  </P> <P> 1989: Sunday Silence  </P> <P> 1988: Winning Colors  </P> <P> 1987: Alysheba  </P> <P> 1986: Ferdinand  </P> <P> 1985: Spend a Buck  </P> <P> 1984: Swale  </P> <P> 1983: Sunny's Halo  </P> <P> 1982: Gato del Sol  </P> <P> 1981: Pleasant Colony  </P> <P> 1980: Genuine Risk  </P> <P> 1979: Spectacular Bid  </P> <P> 1978: Affirmed  </P> <P> 1977: Seattle Slew  </P> <P> 1976: Bold Forbes  </P> <P> 1975: Foolish Pleasure  </P> <P> 1974: Cannonade  </P> <P> 1973: Secretariat  </P> <P> 1972: Riva Ridge  </P> <P> 1971: Canonero II  </P> <P> 1970: Dust Commander  </P> <P> 1969: Majestic Prince  </P> <P> 1968: Forward Pass  </P> <P> 1967: Proud Clarion  </P> <P> 1966: Kauai King  </P> <P> 1965: Lucky Debonair  </P> <P> 1964: Northern Dancer  </P> <P> 1963: Chateaugay  </P> <P> 1962: Decidedly  </P> <P> 1961: Carry Back  </P> <P> 1960: Venetian Way  </P> <P> 1959: Tomy Lee  </P> <P> 1958: Tim Tam  </P> <P> 1957: Iron Liege  </P> <P> 1956: Needles  </P> <P> 1955: Swaps  </P> <P> 1954: Determine  </P> <P> 1953: Dark Star  </P> <P> 1952: Hill Gail  </P> <P> 1951: Count Turf  </P> <P> 1950: Middleground  </P> <P> 1949: Ponder  </P> <P> 1948: Citation  </P> <P> 1947: Jet Pilot  </P> <P> 1946: Assault  </P> <P> 1945: Hoop, Jr.  </P> <P> 1944: Pensive  </P> <P> 1943: Count Fleet  </P> <P> 1942: Shut Out  </P> <P> 1941: Whirlaway  </P> <P> 1940: Gallahadion  </P> <P> 1939: Johnstown  </P> <P> 1938: Lawrin  </P> <P> 1937: War Admiral  </P> <P> 1936: Bold Venture  </P> <P> 1935: Omaha  </P> <P> 1934: Cavalcade  </P> <P> 1933: Brokers Tip  </P> <P> 1932: Burgoo King  </P> <P> 1931: Twenty Grand  </P> <P> 1930: Gallant Fox  </P> <P> 1929: Clyde Van Dusen  </P> <P> 1928: Reigh Count  </P> <P> 1927: Whiskery  </P> <P> 1926: Bubbling Over  </P> <P> 1925: Flying Ebony  </P> <P> 1924: Black Gold  </P> <P> 1923: Zev  </P> <P> 1922: Morvich  </P> <P> 1921: Behave Yourself  </P> <P> 1920: Paul Jones  </P> <P> 1919: Sir Barton  </P> <P> 1918: Exterminator  </P> <P> 1917: Omar Khayyam  </P> <P> 1916: George Smith  </P> <P> 1915: Regret  </P> <P> 1914: Old Rosebud  </P> <P> 1913: Donerail  </P> <P> 1912: Worth  </P> <P> 1911: Meridan  </P> <P> 1910: Donau  </P> <P> 1909: Wintergreen  </P> <P> 1908: Stone Street  </P> <P> 1907: Pink Star  </P> <P> 1906: Sir Huon  </P> <P> 1905: Agile  </P> <P> 1904: Elwood  </P> <P> 1903: Judge Himes  </P> <P> 1902: Alan-a-Dale  </P> <P> 1901: His Eminence  </P> <P> 1900: Lieut.

"Ukraine has pledged to pay 100 million U.S. dollars by the  end of March as part of its debt which amounts to about 1.3  trillion roubles," Vladimir Podmarkov, chief engineer of  Russia's Gazprom gas concern, said on Monday.    Russia and Ukraine agreed in Moscow on March 10 that Ukraine  will pay 50 per cent of its debt for 1993 with financial means,  including hard currency, and the rest with equipment and  materials for Gazprom. The debt for the first quarter of 1994  will be paid only with financial means. Russia resumed gas  supplies to Ukraine, following the agreement. Presently, it  pumps 195 million cubic meters of gas daily to Ukraine.    As for Belarus, its debt for Russian gas supplies has  totalled about 400 billion roubles. It has failed to make the  promised payments so far. In retaliation, Russia has cut gas  supplies to that republic. Podmarkov said Russian gas supplies  to Moldova and the Baltic states are within the agreed limits.</p>

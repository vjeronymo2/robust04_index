			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / Observer: Shephard's lore Whilst Gillian Shephard may have been a pedestrian and ineffective Secretary of State for Employment, she will be remembered for one small achievement. She once said that she would not have succeeded in her job until someone in Eastenders, the TV soap opera, wanted to get a National Vocational Qualification (NVQ), her department's skill-based award. Cue to last Thursday night's episode - just hours after the Cabinet reshuffle - when an Eastenders' star is asked if he has any NVQ's. Unfortunately, the bemused star, like most of the nation, does not know what a NVQ is, and is told it means 'I'm better qualified to be unemployed'. Perhaps, Mrs Shephard will have better luck in getting her message across in her new job. It might be a bit of a demotion, but there is a touch of originality about the choice of a Shephard to run the Ministry of Agriculture.</p>

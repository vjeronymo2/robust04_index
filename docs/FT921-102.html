			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Jakarta believes it has turned the tables on critical donors: William Keeling examines the international and domestic implications of Indonesia's decision to reject all Dutch aid INDONESIA'S decision last week to reject all aid from the Netherlands, its former colonial master, and to disband the donor forum through which it was pledged Dollars 4.75bn in 1991, has turned the tables on the donors. Many took the high moral ground after November's killing of protesters in Indonesian-annexed East Timor; now the donor country which went furthest in stressing the linkage between human rights and aid may be left high and dry. Indonesian government officials described the decision as bilateral in nature. The official statement talked of 'centuries of inhuman colonial subjugation' and the 'barbarous atrocities carried out by the colonial forces during the war of independence' in the late 1940s. Mr Moerdiono, the state secretary and close adviser to President Suharto, cited Dutch criticism of the killings, after which The Hague began a review of future aid, as the latest example of intimidation. The Dutch are among Indonesia's most vocal critics, second only to Portugal, which still claims authority over East Timor, the colonial territory which Jakarta forcibly annexed in 1976. The Netherlands' position since 1968 of chairing the Inter-Governmental Group on Indonesia (IGGI), the now-disbanded donor forum, gave the country a leading role among donors. Indonesia has asked the World Bank to create and chair a consultative forum to replace the Inter-Governmental Group. Jakarta denies that the decision will interfere with private trade, although many Dutch companies benefiting from the aid programme, totalling Dollars 93m last year, will be affected. Dutch companies bidding for public infrastructure projects may also be vulnerable. Prominent Dutch business interests in Indonesia include the Anglo-Dutch conglomerates Shell and Unilever, and ABN bank. In its official response, the Dutch government said that it respected Indonesia's decision but that it objected 'in the strongest terms' to Jakarta's 'wording and reproaches.' Although many donors expressed their outrage at the killings in East Timor, last week's move is unlikely to grow into a wider confrontation. Most donors have followed Indonesia's lead in portraying the affair as bilateral. Dutch diplomats said at the weekend that, since it was not the Netherlands which had cut off aid, the country was not asking its European Community partners to withdraw their own bilateral assistance to Indonesia. However, the Netherlands is likely to be supported on the East Timor issue by its Community partners, EC diplomats said. The EC presidency, held by Portugal, said that what Jakarta described as intimidation by the Dutch 'is the general policy of the Community and its member-states.' (Where some dissent could be sown may be over Indonesia's request to the World Bank to form a new consultative group. Such a move might be viewed as undermining the Dutch and Community's stance on East Timor.) The World Bank, which pledged Dollars 1.6bn to Indonesia at the Inter-Governmental Group meeting last June, said it respected Jakarta's wish to establish a consultative forum and would be approaching donor governments. A spokesman for Japan's foreign affairs ministry said that 'Japan will not change its mind in providing economic aid.' Japan pledged Dollars 1.3bn last year and is Indonesia's largest bilateral donor. Western diplomats in Jakarta deny that they have broken ranks on the linkage between good governance and aid. They argue that since the East Timor massacre the authorities have moved significantly on human rights. 'The Indonesian government has gone far beyond what we would have expected them to do in criticising Abri (the armed forces),' said one European diplomat. In February, six soldiers, including two generals, were found guilty for their role in the massacre, and eight others are being court-martialed. 'The Dutch were too confrontational,' said the diplomat. Domestically, President Suharto's move against The Hague has been welcomed. In addition to appealing to latent nationalism, it has helped appease those in the military unhappy with the recent criticism of Abri. The government's position has also given it more latitude to control any civil unrest before the general election in June. Some diplomats also concede that Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous country with a gross domestic product (GDP) of Dollars 107bn in 1990, is too important to isolate. European, American and Japanese companies compete for lucrative business; in the power sector alone contracts worth Dollars 6.4bn will be completed within the decade. Indeed, the donors' main concern appears to be who will exploit the loss of Dutch influence. 'The Japanese will take up any shortfall in aid, despite their economic downturn. Europe will be the loser,' said one diplomat.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 17 KYODO -- Ichiro Ozawa, top  strategist of the coalition government, said Friday [17 June]  former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa does not have to testify  about his suspected shady financial deals at the Diet.    Ozawa called "invalid" the House of Representatives Budget  Committee's decision Thursday to summon Hosokawa next Tuesday.    Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito, the coalition's core  party led by Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, met reporters and  criticized the decision in which Budget Committee Chairman  Tsuruo Yamaguchi overrode the ruling coalition's objections and  declared his panel would make Hosokawa testify under oath.    The opposition parties forced a motion through the lower  house budget panel to summon Hosokawa in an apparent bid to use  Hosokawa's plight to their advantage and force Hata's minority  government to step down.    Hosokawa's questionable deals were partly responsible for  his  April 8 announcement of his resignation as prime minister.    Hosokawa's former financial secretary appeared before the  budget panel Wednesday to say Hosokawa has indeed paid back a  loan of 100 million yen borrowed in 1982 from the  scandal-tainted Sagawa Kyubin trucking firm.    The secretary, Masatoshi Miyama, denied allegations that  Hosokawa may not have paid back the 100 million yen loan and  that it was received as a secret political donation.</p>

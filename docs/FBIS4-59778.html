			<p>BFN     [Text] Touring the site of this morning's terrorist attack  near Bet Hagay, Chief of Staff Ehud Baraq said he foresees a  continuation of terror attacks in Judaea, Samaria, and the Qatif  bloc. The chief of staff called on all people licensed to carry  weapons to do so, and to help the security forces and  intelligence personnel protect thousands of vehicles driving  through Judaea and Samaria. He added that roadblocks can only  prevent terror attacks in their immediate vicinity and that the  task of providing additional protection for the population falls  to the Israeli Army and the citizens themselves.</p>

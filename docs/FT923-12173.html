			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / Arts: Don Quixote - London Promenade Concerts ROBERTO Gerhard was born in Catalonia in 1896 and died in Cambridge in 1970, having reached Britain as a Spanish Civil War exile more than three decades earlier. These facts - and, even more important, Gerhard's marvellously fertile, open-spirited inventiveness as a composer - were the salient ones in the background to the revival of his 1950 ballet Don Quixote in Sunday's Albert Hall Promenade concert by the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra. This was an important revival - it was billed as the first British concert performance of the complete score (as distinct from the various suites and sets of dances extracted from it, which are often done). In common with the Sheridan opera The Duenna, it was composed during the first years of Gerhard's exile; and like that opera (which was belatedly unveiled to the world in Madrid earlier this year), Don Quixote is an exuberant and imaginative reworking of Gerhard's Iberian musical inheritance in up-to-date 20th century terms. The scenario of the ballet was drawn from Cervantes by Gerhard himself; apparently it was the quirkiness of his narrative plotting, pacing and shaping that accounted for the work's failure to take root in the ballet repertory after the Royal Opera House premiere in 1950 (with choreography by De Valois, decor by Burra, and Helpmann and Fonteyn in the leading roles). In concert the dramatic pressures of the score's narrative recede in importance behind the significance of its purely musical qualities; and in total, these were shown by Simon Rattle and his orchestra to be abundantly rich. Falla's great Spanish ballets are in the background. But so is Berg - as a Schoenberg pupil in the 1920s Gerhard's eyes and ears had long been widened to the value and importance of all the main European musical trend. In parallel with the opera, the special distinction of Don Quixote lies in its attempt - heartfelt, energetic, generous and also keenly focused - to reconcile Gerhard's artistic past, present and future. His success, which seems to me even greater than in The Duenna, makes one grieve all over again at the craven provincialism of the wartime and post-wartime British musical world in its failure to embrace this born theatre-man and draw on his gifts. It is in the psychological depiction of Don Quixote that the modernist Gerhard shows his greatest percipience, developing what the programme-note writer David Drew calls a 'serial skeleton' to depict the 'world of (his) crazed imagination'. The sinuous blending of outer and inner worlds in a musico-dramatic context is what lends the music its special fascination - that, and the sheer sound of the music, which, with its piquant concertante role for the piano and its constant dry rattle of Spanish rhythmic patterning, proves wonderfully alluring. I should have liked to encounter it in a less reverberant, more theatre-like acoustical ambience than that provided by the Albert Hall (as a result of which certain transitional passages seemed to me slightly over-extended). But for Rattle's eloquent, warm-spirited and utterly convinced conducting of the music, and for the lustrous playing of the CBSO, there can be only the highest praise. In the second part of this splendid Prom, the CBSO chorus filled the higher platform tiers and Thomas Trotter the organ loft for one of those uniquely uplifting Rattle accounts of the Janacek Glagolitic Mass that sends everyone out of the hall a happier and better person for having heard it.</p>

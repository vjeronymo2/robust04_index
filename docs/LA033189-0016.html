			<p><P> March 31, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST : LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P>  ALL OF BEETHOVEN'S SONATAS IN 10 HOURS  </P> <P> Ludwig van Beethoven wrote his 32 piano sonatas over a span of 27 years.  </P> <P> Robert Haag plans to play them all in 10 hours from memory Saturday at El  Camino College in Torrance.  </P> <P> "The world won't collapse over my doing this, but it will be fun," said Haag, a  concert pianist and dean at the college who has been playing the sonatas for 25  years -- but never before at one sitting.  </P> <P> While piano marathons are not new -- the world's record of 1,218 hours was set  in Australia in 1982 -- Haag believes his keyboard marathon will be a first for  the Beethoven piano works.  </P> <P> "They were done three or four years ago in New York, but in two segments," he  said.  </P> <P> The musical stunt has a practical purpose. Not only will Haag season the  college's new, nine-foot Steinway concert grand, but he hopes to recoup the  $40,000 price from people who pledge money to hear the music.  </P></p>

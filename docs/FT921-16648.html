			<p>920102 FT  02 JAN 92 / Havel deflects criticism of Czechoslovak reforms PRESIDENT Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia told his countrymen yesterday they had no choice but to persevere with reforms, although the economy had yet to hit bottom. Reuter reports from Prague. He said in a traditional new year address to the nation that it would be foolish to blame the parliament, government and president for economic, legislative and ethnic problems as well as a soaring crime rate and increasing intolerance. 'It is a task for us all and we have no right to protest, for we have chosen it for ourselves,' the president said, referring to the overthrow of the communist system in late 1989. He praised the results of economic reform which started with the liberalisation of prices a year ago. 'A market economy environment is now becoming established. We have managed to sustain a balanced budget, there is no runaway inflation and the foreign debt is manageable.' But he said hopes that the economic slump could be reversed as early as mid-1992 might be premature. 'It seems that we are yet to reach the bottom. But at the same time, preconditions for a change should begin to arise.' Mr Havel said he was 'agitated' by the senseless war in Yugoslavia and the danger of conflicts in the explosive transformation of the post-communist world'. But he stressed he was most concerned by the continuing inability of the Czechs and Slovaks to settle the future set-up of the ferderation, composed of two republics. 'There is not much I can promise you. For myself, it is but one thing: as long as I will be in office, I will use all my prerogatives and influence to support what I deem right and what will help us rediscover ourselves.'</p>

Friends  in the intellectual circles, particularly many experts and  scholars, are extremely concerned about their personal income  tax from the authors' remuneration. Please talk about China's  laws on this connection.    Professor Zheng: China's personal income tax  system was formed in 1980. The Third Session of the Fifth  National People's Congress adopted the "Individual Income Tax  Law." In the "categories of taxable income" this law did not say  anything about authors' remuneration. However, it mentioned  "income from royalties." In the "Rules for the Implementation of  the Individual Income Tax Law," this income was interpreted as  "income from providing and assigning patent rights, copyrights,  rights to use proprietary technology and other rights." Thus,  from this we can understand that authors' remuneration is  included in the income from copyrights. At that time, it was  stipulated that a monthly deduction of 800 yuan is allowed, and  the tax rate was 20 percent.    Reporter: What do intellectuals think about this  law after its enactment?    Professor Zheng: People in the academic field  complain a great deal, because they have to make monthly tax  payments from their income which is in excess of 800 yuan. Some  experts and scholars write a book once in every ten or more  years or even once in a lifetime. However, they must make a  lump-sum tax payment. This is quite unreasonable.    In the "Interim Regulations on Personal Income Regulatory  Tax" proclaimed in 1986, the State Council lowered the monthly  deduction to 400 yuan for the personal income regulatory tax.  However, the monthly deduction remains at 800 yuan for incomes  not exceeding 4,000 yuan from free-lance writing, translation  and transfer of technology. For any single payment of 4,000 yuan  or more, a deduction of 20 percent shall be allowed for  expenses. The remaining amount shall be taxed.    Reporter: From this, we can see that these  regulations take into consideration the interests of those who  invent and create and of the literary and art workers.    Professor Zheng: The No. 69 Document issued by  the State Tax Bureau in 1990 stipulated that if the author's  remuneration for a book does not exceed 20,000 yuan, he or she  will pay income tax with a tax abatement of 30 percent than the  taxable amount listed in the "Interim Regulations on Personal  Income Regulatory Tax." However, for those whose authors'  remuneration for a book exceeds 20,000 yuan, they still need to  pay the personal income regulatory tax as stipulated.    Reporter: This shows another great progress.  According to these regulations, the tax rate for authors'  remuneration under 20,000 yuan per book is only 14 percent.    Professor Zheng: It is so. However, this is only  an administrative document. It is not so binding as a law. In  fact, more than half of the publishing houses do not enforce  these regulations. Most of them say that they have not seen such  a document.    Reporter: The "Individual Income Tax Law" revised  on 31 October 1993 explicitly stipulates that "the tax rate  applicable to income from authors' remuneration is 20 percent  with a tax abatement of 30 percent, and that for income from  personal services or authors' remuneration, a deduction of 800  yuan shall be allowed for expenses, if the amount received in a  single payment is less than 4,000 yuan. For single payments of  4,000 yuan or more, a deduction of 20 percent shall be allowed  for expenses. The remaining amount shall be taxed.    Professor Zheng: In this way, the tax rate for  authors' remuneration is still 14 percent. As compared with the  tax rates of other incomes, this is fairly preferential.  Besides, it is written into the state law this time.    We must emphatically point out that according to a  provision of the revised "Individual Income Tax Law" on tax  exemption, if a book or thesis wins the prize of a  provincial-level government, a ministry or commission under the  State Council, a PLA unit at or above the Corps level and any  foreign or international organization in the fields of science,  education, technology, culture, public health, sports,  environmental protection and others, the prize is tax-free in  despite of its amount.    Reporter: After a book is published, in what way  can its author pay his or her income tax from his remuneration?    Professor Zheng: In practice, the publishing  house generally withholds the amount of income tax that the  author needs to pay before it pays the author's remuneration,  and should mail a copy of the necessary tax form to the author.  Some of the publishing houses do not withhold income tax for the  authors. They should mail the authors the tax paper anyway. As  far as authors are concerned, they better ask the publishing  houses if they are not so sure whether or not the publishing  houses have withheld the income tax or not, because tax evasion  is subject to administrative punishment or even criminal  prosecution.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Nikolay Zakrevskyy: "Hard Currency Discord </F> Within the Noble Family: Kravchuk Thinks, Zvyahilskyy Decides,  Yushchenko Protests"]    [Text]  <H5>  Acting Prime Minister Yukhym Leonidovich Zvyahilskyy: </H5> "Introduction of a Fixed Karbovanets Rate is Not an  Administrative But an Economic Step...."    The head of the government, who sent a letter defending his  position on "currency" issues to the Ukrainian president, is  confident of this. KIYEVSKIYE VEDOMOSTI has the complete text  of this letter and cites its main provisions: "The exchange  rate of the Ukrainian karbovanets, which was artificially  reduced by the Ukrainian Interbank Stock Exchange, did not  correspond to the purchasing power of these currencies [as  published], because the stock exchange did not conduct actual  purchases or sales, while the agreements, which were concluded  there, accounted only a percentage of the currency turnover in  our state." This is how Yukhym Leonidovich explained the reason  for shutting down the stock exchange.    However, the decision to perform obligatory sales of  obtained  hard currency -- according to the fixed rate -- is aimed at  "deducting part of the subsidies that enterprises receive for  exporting products from the state budget, which will not in any  way encroach upon the interests of export enterprises." What  kind of subsidies does he mean? Yukhym Leonidovich clarifies:  "In 1992-93, the National Bank issued huge loans to the  Ukrainian Government to subsidize industry, transportation, and  agriculture. A considerable portion of these subsidies was used  to produce products for export. So, when exporters sold products  for convertible currency, they received additional profits  because of state subsidies, the falling karbovanets exchange  rate, and exemptions from VAT and stock holdings."    To whisk through the Cabinet of Ministers the decision on a  karbovanets exchange rate, Yu. L. Zvyahilskyy clarified his  commitment to the issue -- how to put it, in advance -- to the  Ukrainian president. What is its essence?    "Due to the fixed karbovanets exchange rate, the  agricultural  sector will be provided with fuel and lubricants, spare parts,  and pesticides to carry out the spring sowing campaign. We  managed to stabilize prices -- including those on food, fuel,  and lubricants -- on the domestic market. The monthly inflation  rate fell from some 50 percent in 1993 to 19 percent in January  1994. The demand for karbovanetses on the Moscow Currency Stock  Exchange remains high. The fixed karbovanets exchange rate  promises stable conditions for buying critical imported goods,  primarily, energy resources and timber used in mining for the  coal industry. A stable currency rate creates opportunities to  decrease production costs and increase production for the  domestic market. The latest factor encourages the purchasing  power of the national currency and stabilizes the state's  financial system. In addition, a fixed currency rate stabilizes  prices on products of export enterprises, which makes it  possible to conclude long-term treaties on the delivery of  Ukrainian goods to the global market... It also makes it  possible to attract foreign investment to the Ukrainian  economy...."  <H5>  Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk: "We Should Take Into </H5> Consideration the Opinion of the New Supreme Council and the  Government on the Fixed Karbovanets Exchange Rate...."    This is how Leonid Makarovich answered my "currency"  question  when he was in our editorial offices.    The current system of a fixed currency rate prompted the  situation when 1993 currency profits in Ukraine -- according to  estimates made by Ukrainian and foreign experts -- constituted  20-40 percent of the expected total, that is, some 60-80 percent  of the earned currency remained abroad. What is your and your  advisers' opinion on a fixed currency exchange rate? Do you  know how to bring back the money -- earned by Ukrainian  exporters -- which is currently not doing anything to help  Ukraine?    This issue is of a broad nature, stressed Leonid Makarovich.  Until now, there has been no single opinion on this issue. Even  the National Bank does not have one. When representatives of  the National Bank of Ukraine, other interested organizations,  members of the Cabinet of Ministers, and myself held a meeting,  our viewpoints differed once again. The current economic  situation -- the decreasing inflation rate, cheapening of some  products -- also speaks in favor of a fixed exchange rate.  Therefore, we cannot simply reject this idea outright. All  agree that when we have no national currency (we really lack it  because the karbovanets is a deficient currency) we cannot move  to a currency market. There exists the opinion that to  introduce a national currency, we should cover it in our  financial and credit relations.    The president's advisers support the following position: We  require more freedom. In my opinion, before we adopt a money  market, a fixed, or a floating exchange rate, we should analyze  all of the pros and cons. One of the arguments against this is  that we should change the scale of prices and salaries and  financial indexes in the national economy. By the way, we  should introduce extraordinary increases -- by two or three  times. That is, the scale of cash and pricing mechanisms should  be changed. The budget should also be changed. However, it has  already been adopted. It would be necessary to consider the  opinion of the new Supreme Council and the government, which  will be nominated by it. In my opinion, this is a problem of  our tomorrow.  <H5>  Ukrainian National Bank Chairman Viktor Yushchenko: "Given </H5> Hyperinflation, the Policy of the Fixed Currency Rate Will Make  Ukraine a Multibillion Debtor!"    This answer, please note -- which is diametrically opposed  to  the opinion of the head of the government -- was contained in a  letter from the chief banker. He addressed this letter to  Andrey Pecherov, former chairman of the legislative commission  for planning, budget, and prices. A stormy discussion of  Yushchenko's letter, according to UNIAN, did not resolve this  issue. The president's commission will probably hold a  roll-call vote on a fixed exchange rate in the legislature. It  would not be difficult to guess the results because there will  not be many brave men "to turn the steering wheel by 20 points"  from Zvyahilskyy's course. However, Viktor Yushchenko's  position will not be the last in legislative debates.    "The use of the fixed currency exchange rate" when  hyperinflation is in full swing, according to the Ukrainian  National Bank chairman, "will lead to a further shift from the  true market rate. The longer the fixing period, the higher the  difference in currency rates."    "According to IMF experts, the volume of currency means,  which did not return to Ukraine in 1993, stood at $1.3 billion.  According to trade statistics from the United States, Germany,  and Italy, the volume of Ukrainian exports and imports to these  states is four times more than those registered in the customs  statistics of Ukraine.    "Let us take into consideration the fact that the trade in  currency to a specific group of importers at the lower rate  simply provides them with additional income. The result of this  policy is as follows: Given the situation of hyperinflation,  the policy of fixing a currency rate, the limiting of exports  and increases in imports will make Ukraine a multibillion  debtor, because it liquidates the only source of currency  generation -- the production of goods for export..."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Debbie Kuo] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 21 (CNA) -- Interior Minister Wu  Poh-hsiung Saturday [21 May] called child prostitution a "shame  of society" and urged harsher penalties for pimps and persons  who frequent child prostitutes.    Speaking during a seminar on child prostitution, Wu said  child prostitution not only harms social morals but also  infringes on people's human rights.    Wu said the Interior Ministry has recently completed a child  prostitution prevention plan which seeks to pool the efforts of  all sectors of society to crack down on the crime.    Under the plan, Wu said, the ministry will offer cash  rewards  for information leading to the arrest of pimps who control and  live off the money earned by child prostitutes.    Chen Hui-chi, an executive at the Taipei's Women's Rescue  Foundation, said besides imposing severe penalties on those who  frequent child prostitutes, the names of the "Johns" should be  publicized to help stamp out the crime.    Shen Mei-chen, a lawyer familiar with child prostitution  offenses, said that the government will have to revise its laws  if it intends to eliminate the "shame of society."    Shen said current laws make it difficult for police to deal  with men who seek the services of child prostitutes. The laws  say that the men can only be prosecuted for the offense if a  complaint is filed.    Shen called for revisions to anti-prostitution laws which  would make seeking a child prostitute a criminal offense.    It was estimated last year that more than 10,000 children or  teenagers were involved in the sex industry. Of them, only some  2,000 have been arrested by the police.</p>

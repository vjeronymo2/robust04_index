			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>   [Text] Moscow January 13 TASS -- Vladimir Shumeyko who was  elected the speaker of the Federation Council, the upper chamber  of the Russian parliament, denied the possibility that he may  with time become an arch rival of President Boris Yeltsin like  it happened with former Parliament Speaker Ruslan Khasbulatov.    "It is hardly possible that our relations will be difficult.  Boris Yeltsin and I share the same point of view", he said  adding that they both stand for the strengthening of the  presidency in Russia.    Khasbulatov was a staunch supporter of Yeltsin before 1991  Soviet coup, but turned rival when Yeltsin began his market  reforms in the country.    Shumeyko said his main task in the Federation Council will  be  to rule out "hidden intrigues, shady deals and agreements  between factions" of the upper chamber.    He added that the Council of the Federation may bypass the  State Duma, which is the main legislative chamber, in case the  latter works "unconstructively".    "It is possible, in cooperation with those deputies of the  State Duma who really want to do something, to draft lawbills in  joint commissions and committees and adopt them right here (in  the federation council)", Shumeyko explained, but added that  this may be done only in "extreme situations" and in case of a  "tough necessity".    Shumeyko said his election to the post of the speaker was  the  "triumph of commonsense". He succeeded to win the post only in  three attempts and encountered a tough competition from his  conservative rival Petr Romanov.    Shumeyko will most evidently lose his job of the first  deputy  prime minister and, according to a draft resolution of the  chamber, will only be paid the same salary by the government for  two years.</p>

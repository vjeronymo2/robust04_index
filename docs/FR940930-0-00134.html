			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> These states are required to revise their State Implementation Plans (SIPs) to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensure that ``covered fleet'' owners will include, through purchase or lease, a minimum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percentage of CFVs among the new vehicles they purchase for their fleets. (A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``covered fleet'' is defined in CAA section 241 as a fleet of ten or more motor vehicles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which are owned or operated, leased, or otherwise controlled by a single person.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Both private business and government (federal, state, and local) fleets are subject to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the statute. However, certain fleets and vehicles are exempt from the regulations,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including fleets with vehicles that cannot be fueled at a central location, vehicles that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are normally garaged at a personal residence, or vehicles that belong to vehicle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> classes without applicable CFV standards. (See the Definitions Rule: 58 FR 64679,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> December 9, 1993). In their SIP revisions, states must include provisions to require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that CFVs used in the clean fuel fleet program operate on fuels on which they comply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the CFV standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Covered fleet operaters can also meet the requirements by converting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conventional vehicles to CFVs, or by obtaining credits. CAA section 246(a)(3) requires  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that all states containing all or part of an ozone and/or CO nonattainment area  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described above that is reclassified in the future as a serious, severe, or extreme  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ozone nonattainment area, or has a CO design value at or above 16.0 parts per  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> million, must prepare revised SIPs implementing the CFF program within one year of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reclassification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Three vehicle classes are included in the CFF program: light-duty vehicles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (LDVs) and light-duty trucks (LDTs) up to 8,500 lbs GVWR, <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  and heavy-duty vehicles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (HDVs) between 8,500 lbs and 26,000 lbs GVWR. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  To qualify as a CFV, a vehicle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must meet one of three sets of increasingly stringent standards. These are referred to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as low-emission vehicle (LEV) standards, ultra low-emission vehicle (ULEV) standards,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=4 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=4 --> Gross Vehicle Weight Rating. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=4 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=4 --> HDVs over 26,000 lbs GVWR are not included in the mandatory program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> CAA section 242(a) requires EPA to promulgate CFV emission standards for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purposes of compliance with the CFF program and the Pilot program (LEV standards).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, section 246(f)(4) requires EPA to promulgate emission standards for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purposes of the CFF program credit program (ULEV and ZEV standards). Under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 249(d)(3), the CFF credit program standards will also apply to the Pilot credit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program. Therefore, vehicles that meet ULEV or ZEV standards are eligible for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle purchase credits under the CFF program and for manufacturers' credits under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Pilot program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The CAA Amendments of 1990 require EPA to promulgate a Pilot program for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the sale of CFVs in the State of California. Whereas the CFF program will be run by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual states, the Pilot program is a federal program that will be administered in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California. Manufacturers with motor vehicle sales in California are required to sell a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimum number of light-duty CFVs (CFVs up to 8,500 lbs. GVWR) in California on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an annual basis. Manufacturers may meet their share of required sales by selling the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required number of CFVs or by using earned credits or credits they have acquired  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from other manufacturers. (EPA established the credits program in a previous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rulemaking (57 FR 60038; December 17, 1992)). To earn credits, a manufacturer may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sell more CFVs than required or sell CFVs which meet stricter exhaust emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards. Except for heavy LDTs, for model years 1996 through 2001, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance standards for the Pilot program are known as the TLEV standards and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> credits are available for LEV, ULEV and ZEV purchases. Beginning in 2001, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance vehicle shifts to the LEV standards, and credits are only available for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ULEV and ZEV purchases. This provision commences in the 1998 model year for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> heavy LDTs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The CAA also directs EPA to establish a voluntary opt in program for states  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that want to adopt the Pilot program. States which contain all or part of any ozone  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonattainment areas classified under subpart D of Title II as serious, severe, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extreme are eligible to participate. To do so, states are to revise their state  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementation plans (SIPs) to include incentives for the sale and use of CFVs as well  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as the production and distribution of clean alternative fuels. States may not establish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CFV sales or production mandates, however.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The remainder of today's action covers light- and heavy-duty CFV exhaust  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission standards, requirements for vehicle conversions to CFVs, and the Pilot  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program, as well as regulatory impacts of the CFF and Pilot programs. In addition,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA has included several technical amendments and clarifications related to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Definitions rule (58 FR 64679) and the rulemaking for the CFF credits program and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transportation control measure exemptions (58 FR 11888; March 1, 1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Indonesia will explore the possibility of making  contact with Amnesty International, an international  nongovernmental organization, to discuss various matters,  especially the East Timor issue, to enable them to understand  the incorporation of the territory into Indonesia. Foreign  Minister Ali Alatas said this in Jakarta today before leaving  for a tripartite meeting with UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali  and Portuguese Foreign Minister Durao Barroso in Geneva on 6  May. According to Ali Alatas, Indonesia's readiness to accept  members of international nongovernmental organizations and  foreign reporters is part of its effort to create mutual trust  with Portugal.    Regarding Vietnamese refugees on Galang Island, Riau, Ali  Alatas confirmed that a refugee died from self-immolation when  an interdepartmental team visited the area recently. Ali Alatas  deeply regretted the inevitable incident.</p>

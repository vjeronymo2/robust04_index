			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 6. General Summary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It is now generally accepted that some chemicals, including industrial agents,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pesticides, therapeutic agents, drugs of abuse, food-related chemicals, and cosmetic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ingredients, can have adverse effects on the structure and function of the nervous system. It  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has recently been proposed that exposure to neurotoxicants might also be associated with Parkinsonism and Alzheimer's disease. Several Federal agencies have initiated research  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs in neurotoxicology, developed neurotoxicology testing guidelines, and used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neurotoxic endpoints to regulate chemicals in the environment and workplace.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The scientific basis for identifying and characterizing chemical-induced neurotoxicity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has advanced rapidly during the last several years. The manifestation of neurotoxicity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> depends on the relationship between exposure (applied dose) and the dose at the site of toxic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action (delivered or target dose) and response. Chemical-induced changes in the structure or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> function of the nervous system at the cellular or molecular level can be observed as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alterations in sensory, motor, or cognitive function at the level of the whole organism.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several important features about the nervous system make it particularly vulnerable to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chemical insult, including differential susceptibilities at different stages of maturation, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> presence of blood brain and nerve barriers that may be the target of toxic action, high  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> metabolic rate, and limited regenerative capability following damage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Methods devised to detect and quantify agent-induced changes in nervous system  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> function in humans include clinical evaluations and neurotoxicity testing methods such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neurobehavioral, neurophysiological, neurochemical, imaging, and self-reporting procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Experimental approaches used in human neurotoxicology include epidemiological studies and,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to a limited extent, human laboratory exposure studies. There are several important  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unresolved issues in human neurotoxicology, including the development of commonly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accepted risk assessment criteria and animal-to-human extrapolation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is generally assumed that if physical or chemical-induced neurotoxicity is observed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in animal models, then neurotoxicity will be produced in humans. Considerable research has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been performed to demonstrate the validity of many animal models in an experimental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> context and to show predictive validity. Methods in animal neurotoxicology are frequently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used in a tier-testing framework with simpler, more cost-effective tests to screen or identify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neurotoxic potential. In hazard identification, the presence of neurotoxicity at the first tier is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used to make decisions about subsequent development of a chemical or about the need to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conduct additional experiments to define the level at which neurotoxicity will be observed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A number of methods have been devised for studies in animal neurotoxicology, including  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neurobehavioral, neurophysiological, neurochemical, and neuroanatomical techniques. It is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> known that the neuroendocrine system may be affected adversely by neurotoxicants and that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> there are populations that are differentially vulnerable to neurotoxic agents. Considerable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> research is in progress to employ structure-activity relationships to predict neurotoxicity and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> newly developed in vitro procedures are being used to augment or complement currently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing in vivo approaches.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Principles of risk assessment for neurotoxicity are evolving rapidly. At the present  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time, neurotoxicity risk assessment is generally limited to qualitative hazard identification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Neurotoxicological risk assessments have been generally based on a no observed adverse  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effect level and uncertainty factors. As with other noncancer endpoints, there is a need to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consider more information about the shape of the dose-response curve and mechanisms of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effect in quantitative neurotoxicology risk assessment. Research is needed to develop  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dose-response models that incorporate biologic information and mechanistic hypotheses into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quantitative extrapolation of dose-response relationships across species and from high to low  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dose exposures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

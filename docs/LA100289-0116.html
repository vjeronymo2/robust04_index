			<p><P> October 2, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BOXER, MOTHER ARRESTED IN STREET BRAWL  </P> <P> International Boxing Federation middleweight champion Michael Nunn was arrested  on charges of assault after a brawl involving about 20 people.  </P> <P> Nunn's mother, Madies Nunn, and Raymond Jones, Nunn's bodyguard, also were  arrested Sunday by Davenport police. They were also charged with assault.  </P> <P> Police said that Nunn struck an officer and that his mother hit an officer with  her shoe. They said Jones threatened an officer with an ax.  </P> <P> The fight erupted about 3:30 p.m. at a Davenport street corner, and about a  dozen officers were called. All involved were released shortly after being  taken into custody, and police would not say what other charges were filed in  the case.  </P> <P> Nunn, a resident of Agoura Hills and a native of Davenport, made no comment as  he was being led from the scene, other than to ask police to remove the  handcuffs. "I'm cool. I'm cool," he repeated.  </P> <P> Nunn later told the Quad-City Times that he was merely trying to break up the  fight.  </P> <P> Nunn was in town visiting his mother, said Bob Surchein, an adviser to the  boxer.  </P></p>

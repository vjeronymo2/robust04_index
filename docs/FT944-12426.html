			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Change promised in Macedonia Macedonia's President Kiro Gligorov promised yesterday to press for reforms and better relations with his country's neighbours after his party won a two-thirds majority in elections boycotted by the opposition. His Alliance for Macedonia party said at a news conference it had won 88 of parliament's 120 seats. State television earlier put the figure at 83. 'We shall have to tackle the reforms we have already started in our political sphere, our judiciary and the economy, including privatisation of state enterprises,' said Mr Gligorov. Commenting on relations with Greece, which has blockaded his landlocked country, he said he wanted an agreement as soon as possible, and expressed hope for a compromise on the issues of Macedonia's name, flag and constitution, as demanded by Athens.</p>

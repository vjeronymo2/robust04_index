			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] [Editorial Report] Tel Aviv BITA'ON HEYL HA'AVIR in  Hebrew, February 1994, on pages 4, 8, 24, and 25 reports details  on F-16 refueling capabilities, real-time satellite imaging, and  a comparison of the F-22 with the Eurofighter and French Rafal.    On page 4, the journal reports that the F-16 will be  equipped  shortly with a new system that will enable it to be refueled  in-air by Hercules aircraft. Other warplanes will also  similarly be equipped. This will increase the in-air refueling  capaability beyond that currently being offered by Boeing  aircraft.    On page 8, the journal quotes Professor Valentin  Proyalyiker,  director of the new center for satellite information research at  Bar-Ilan University, who says, "For the first time in Israel we  will be able to receive real-time satellite imagery without  depending on the approval of foreign elements." The official  name of the center is "The Center for Remote Sensing." This is  possible because of a unique cooperation agreement with the  Institute for Radiophysics and Electronics at Krarkov in the  Ukraine. The center receives broadcasts from the Ukrainian  satellite Okean, which was launched last December. A microwave  radar (3.2-cm wavelength) and television camera were mounted on  the satellite. The radar resolution is not high (500 meters)  and the camera sweep area is 500-2,000 km. The resolution of  the next satellite radar (SICH), which will be launched in 1995,  will be much higher with underground search capability.  Information is easily accessible because Kharkov and Israel are  on the same longitudinal line along which the satellite moves.    On pages 24 and 25, the journal reports that Israel will  need  a new fighter aircraft for the next decade to replace the F-15.  The only existing fighter expected to remain in competition  will be the F-18. Three planes are expected to lead the combat  aircraft market at the start of the 21st century: the American  F-22, the European Eurofighter, and the French Rafal. Due to  technical and budgetary problems with the Eurofighter and the  Rafal, the F-22 is expected, for now, to be the fighter plane of  choice. It meshes well with the philosophy of the Israel Air  Force with its maneuverability, low-radar signature, ability to  carry lethal air-to-air missiles, and its air-to-ground smart  weapons capability.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Good Morning From Mexico" newscast] </F>   [Text] Manuel Camacho Solis, Chiapas State peace and  reconciliation commissioner, has called for more respect for the  role of churches in the conflict area so as not to provoke forms  of violence. After meeting with evangelicals on 26 January,  Camacho considered as very damaging to the peace process the  statements accusing church members of instigating the armed  conflict. He explained this could create new forms of violence  instead of contributing to the resolution of the situation.    After leaving Los Pinos Residence, where he met with  President Salinas de Gortari, Camacho announced that things are  moving on the right track, adding that at noon on 27 January he  will report the results of the measures taken to the Zapatist  National Liberation Army forces.</p>

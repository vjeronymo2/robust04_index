			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Plasterboard cost expected to rise PRICES paid for plasterboard, one of the most basic building materials, are expected to rise by nearly 10 per cent following a restructuring of list prices and discounts by BPB Industries, which supplies about 65 per cent of plasterboard sold in Britain. This marks the end of a three-way price war between BPB, Lafarge Coppee of France and Knauf of Germany. BPB says a decline in list prices will be more than offset by reductions in discounts. Sales prices, after allowing for lower discounts, are expected to rise on average by nearly 10 per cent. This follows a price rise of about 4 per cent, after discounts announced earlier this year by Knauf. BPB's share price rose 9p to 144p after it announced the price changes.</p>

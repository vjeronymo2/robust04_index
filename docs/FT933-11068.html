			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Israeli onslaught ignores Hizbollah truce offer ISRAEL yesterday ignored a truce offer from pro-Iranian Hizbollah guerrillas and vowed to continue its devastating aerial and artillery bombardment of villages in southern Lebanon. The decision not to let up in its offensive came amid continuing US efforts behind the scenes to arrange a ceasefire after six days of bombing of southern Lebanon by Israeli warplanes and heavy calibre cannons. Israel's cabinet, which held a special meeting in Tel Aviv, said it would continue the onslaught which has driven more than a quarter of a million Shia Moslem villagers from their homes until Hizbollah stopped rocket attacks on Israel. At least 126 people have been killed since Sunday and more than 500 wounded. Before the cabinet meeting, Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, secretary-general of the Islamic fundamentalist Hizbollah said they would stop attacks after Israel carried out a 'complete and permanent halt of aggression against villages and civilians.' Beirut interpreted the move as a measure of defensiveness from Hizbollah, the target of increasing criticism from many among the 300,000 refugees from the south for having triggered their plight. With Israel apparently implacable in its insistence that it will not stop the bombardment without hard guarantees first that Hizbollah attacks will also be halted, all eyes in Beirut yesterday were fixed firmly on Damascus, where Syria, Iran and Lebanon held a second day of talks. The Lebanese government has said it is politically incapable of moving against Hizbollah, although it is widely felt by diplomats and Lebanese politicians that the Lebanese army could control the fighters if Syria gave its political approval. The anxiousness of Mr Rafik al-Hariri, the Lebanese prime minister, to find some such formula is clearly signalled by the fact that he has now spent most of the last three days in Damascus, where his talks with Mr Farouk Sharaa, the Syrian foreign minister, were unexpectedly joined on Thursday by Mr Ali Akbar Velayati, Iran's foreign minister - bringing together in Damascus both of Hizbollah's main sponsors. Nothing had emerged from these talks by late last night but Lebanese politicians expected an announcement that Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, would postpone his visit to the region by at least 48 hours as an attempt to increase further the pressure on Syria to agree to rein in Hizbollah. Meanwhile, in a special briefing for US reporters Mr Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign minister, said the government had ruled out both a ground offensive and an expansion of the area of southern Lebanon it controls. His remarks followed a large deployment of tanks and motorised infantry into the buffer zone on Thursday evening. Further troop reinforcements and between 40 and 50 tanks and other equipment crossed the border yesterday into the zone after guerrillas had fired rocket salvoes into Israel.

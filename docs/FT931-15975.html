			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Money Markets: Softer cash rates TENSIONS in European cash and futures markets eased yesterday as dealers continued to take the view that this week's cut in German money market rates marked a significant turning-point in the European currency crisis, writes James Blitz. On Thursday afternoon in Europe, dealers barely reacted to Germany's 15 basis point cut in the fixed repo rate. But the market reacted far more positively yesterday, and a number of dealers were almost ecstatic about the implications of the Bundesbank's move. French cash rates softened for the second day running. Three-month money in the eurodeposit market closed down at 12 per cent from 12 1/2 per cent the day before. French franc futures enjoyed a good rally, with the March contract gaining 19 basis points to close at 90.63. Only three days after the Bank of France was forced to put up short-dated interest rates because of pressure on the franc, one dealer said yesterday: 'France is now outstanding value.' Euromark futures also reflected the bullish sentiment, with the March contract rising 9 basis points to peak at 92.23, before closing at 92.20. However, even before Christmas, the market had been pricing in a cut in official German rates, and yesterday's closing price for the contract was unchanged on the week. It assumes that 3-month money will fall by 80 basis points over the next two months. German call money eased yesterday to reflect the Bundesbank's new dealing rate. Call money slid to 8.65-8.75 per cent from 8.80-8.85 per cent and forward money rates were down more strongly. Trade in sterling markets showed some bullishness about the possibility that base rates could come down again. Three-month money closed a fraction softer on the offered side at 7 1/4 per cent. The March short sterling contract was only a little more optimistic, showing a 3 basis point rise on the day to close at 93.33. At this level, it assumes that 3-month money will be more than 90 basis points lower by the spring. However, this was still not as bullish as the sterling market had been before Christmas. One dealer reported that sentiment had been slightly spoiled by what he called 'the erratic shortages' in the discount market in recent days.</p>

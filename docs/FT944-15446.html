			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Ukraine expects lowest grain harvest in over a decade Ukraine, the former Soviet Union's bread basket blessed with exceptionally fertile soil, yesterday announced it expects this year's grain harvest to be the lowest in over a decade. The gross harvest, including corn, will stand at 37.7m tonnes this year, 6.4m less than expected and a 17 per cent drop on last year's 45.6m tonne harvest, according to the Ministry of Agriculture. However, Mr Viktor Gluzdeyev, a government spokesman, told Interfax-Ukraine news agency yesterday that Ukraine does not plan to make up the gap with imports and that the harvest is sufficient to meet domestic demand. The large state-run sectors produced a 35m tonne harvest yield, short of an expected 40.7m tonnes. The tiny private farms showed slightly better average yields. Overall, average grain yields will be 28.6 centners per hectare, roughly half western European levels. The blame for the lower yields - the spring crop was also down 40 per cent - rests partly on a drought this year and on the slow pace of Ukraine's attempts to overhaul the agricultural sector, which is ruled by powerful lobbies. Declining production might jump start reform, however. Structural changes urged by the World Bank include land reform, privatisation of food processing and farm infrastructure such as grain silos, and liberalisation of domestic trade in products. Experts say reforms are needed to improve incentives for farmers who are currently forced to sell at low state-set prices, and to restructure the inefficient collectives still dominant in Ukraine. Mr Neil Spooner, an agricultural consultant, said the fault lies with the government's controls on prices and trade, not with farmers or the land, since average yields at state and private farms are half those achieved on farms participating in joint-ventures with western firms. A Ukrainian government spokesman this week outlined plans to eventually put 60 per cent of land in public hands - the state currently owns 93 per cent. Subsidies to Ukraine's agricultural sector eat up half the state's annual budget and feed inflation. Economic advisers argue farming can survive without the credits and even compete on western markets. Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma in a policy speech last week endorsed farm reform, including plans to decentralise control within powerful ministries such as agriculture. 'The key to the realisation of real reform in Ukraine is agriculture,' he said.</p>

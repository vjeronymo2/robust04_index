			<p>BFN     [Text] Hanoi, May 26 (XINHUA) -- The United States and  Vietnam have officially decided to establish liaison offices in  each other's capitals, Hanoi and Washington, in an attempt to  normalize the two countries' relations.    The Vietnamese Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the  decision would create favorable conditions for the two  governments to solve issues of common concern and was in the  interests of the two peoples for achieving peace, stability and  development in the region.    The move follows a decision in February this year by U.S.  President Bill Clinton to officially lift his country's  30-year-old trade embargo against Vietnam.    On May 20 and 21, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Winston  Lord and Vietnamese Deputy Foreign Minister Le Mai exchanged  letters about the final decision on setting up the liaison  offices.    They agreed that the offices will perform their roles under  the Vienna Convention regulations which specified consular  relations, signed by the U.S. and Vietnamese governments in 1963.</p>

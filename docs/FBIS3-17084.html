			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The brief talks held in Moscow Tuesday morning [22  March] between a Russian delegation and a mission from the  International Monetary Fund (IMF) "had a working character".  "The stands taken by the two sides were a long way from  compromise," INTERFAX was told by a senior official from  Russia's Finance Ministry.    The IMF delegation wants the main differences connected with  the granting of the 2nd half of the $1.5 Bn [billion] credit to  be discussed between Russia's Prime Minister, Viktor  Chernomyrdin, and the head of the IMF, Michel Camdessus.    The two men are to confer Tuesday evening, the Finance  Ministry source said. The acting Finance Minister, Sergey  Dubinin, is expected to join them.    This stand will make it possible for the IMF leadership "not  to miss the main thing" during the upcoming meeting with  Chernomyrdin -- that is obtain official assurances on the  fundamental issues, the Finance Ministry official said.    In answer to INTERFAX's question about prospects for the  work  of the IMF mission in Moscow after Camdessus's departure, the  source said that two possibilities are the most probable.    First: further talks will be halted after fruitless meetings  between the head of the IMF and the Russian leadership. The  other possibility is this -- the dialogue will continue,  provided that Moscow and the IMF reach a compromise. In this  case the two sides will have to coordinate "three or four"  figures connected with the parameters of Russia's economy.</p>

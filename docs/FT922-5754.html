			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Poland to turn to secret past THE vexed issue of past collaboration with the communist secret police, which has never been properly aired in Poland, came to the fore yesterday, writes Christopher Bobinski from Warsaw. Mr Janusz Korwin Mikke, a deputy from the small right-wing UPR group, signalled that he would put a motion ordering the Interior Ministry to 'provide full information on government officials, senators, deputies, judges and lawyers who had worked with the SB security service between 1945 and 1992'. Initial reactions showed that it would get a majority. The Interior Ministry is quietly conducting such investigations.</p>

			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Lebanon PM and president disagree Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri and President Elias Hrawi locked horns yesterday over a planned government reshuffle, Reuter reports from Beirut. The billionaire prime minister put off all appointments, stayed at home and cancelled tomorrow'a regular cabinet meeting, emerging only to greet hundreds of supporters who flocked to his Beirut residence in a show of solidarity. The two men agreed last week during a visit to Syria, the main foreign power broker in Lebanon, to strengthen Christian representation in the cabinet but have since disagreed over the extent of the reshuffle and the new names to be brought in. Relations between the Syrian-backed government and the once-dominant Christian minority have been tense in recent weeks and the proposed changes appeared an attempt to improve them by bringing in more representative Christian politicians. Political observers said Mr Hariri wanted to bring four new ministers into the 30-member cabinet - two heavyweight Maronite Christian politicians representing influential Christian political parties, a Sunni Moslem and a Shi'ite Moslem. He also wanted to swap several portfolios, including interior, defence and information, among the present ministers. The observers said Mr Hrawi objected to the names Mr Hariri was proposing. He was pressing for a broader reshuffle amounting to a change in government that would reduce the strength of Mr Hariri's supporters in the cabinet while increasing the Christian representation. Complicating the dispute, parliament Speaker Nabih Berri rejected Mr Hariri's suggestions and insisted that a Shi'ite should be named finance minister. Mr Hariri, a Sunni Moslem, currently holds the finance portfolio with Sunni Moslem Fouad Siniora, a close aide, as minister of state for finance.</p>

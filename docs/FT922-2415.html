			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / International Company News: Gota offered SKr13.5bn in protection THE SKr13.5bn (Dollars 2.4bn) five-year insurance rescue plan designed to protect Sweden's Gota Bank from credit losses and unpaid interest represents a bold attempt to stabilise its position and remove the uncertainties surrounding the group. The solution stems from an initiative of Gota's main shareholder, Trygg-Hansa, one of Sweden's leading insurance companies, which still intends to incorporate the bank as a subsidiary this year. An insurance company has been set up to provide cover for Gota. It will be indirectly owned by two triple-A rated European insurance groups, which have not been named; JP Morgan; and Trygg-Hansa's holding company, which will provide cover for about 11 per cent of the bank's credit portfolio, with a maximum risk of SKr1bn. The insurance agreement provides cover of credit losses of up to SKr6bn by 1996, as well as unpaid interest and remission of interest to SKr7.5bn. Mr Gabriel Urwitz, Gota's president and chief executive, said yesterday: 'The uncertainty surrounding the magnitude of our credit losses and their effect on Gota's capital base should now be over.' The insurance scheme has already been applied to Gota, helping the group's results for the first four months of the year, for which it incurred operating losses of SKr638m. Without the insurance plan, it would have made credit losses of SKr1.36bn, or 5.1 per cent of its total loan volume. Instead, credit losses amounted to SKr210m. While Gota paid an insurance premium of SKr1.14bn, it utilised SKr1.15bn to cover its credit losses. The insurance plan may seem over-cautious for a bank with a risk-weighted capital adequacy ratio of 11.8 per cent, well above the 8 per cent Bank of International Settlements requirement. However, it underlines the determination of Trygg-Hansa to ensure that Gota's troubles are resolved quickly. Two months ago, Trygg-Hansa bid for all Gota's outstanding shares, giving it a SKr2bn equity injection. That bid still stands. Mr Bjorn Sprangare, Trygg-Hansa's chief executive, said: 'Strengthening Gota's financial stability is important to us. Our intention to incorporate Gota as a wholly-owned subsidiary of our company remains unchanged.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] There is apparently no end to the fighting in  Liberia. Charles Taylor's NPFL [National Patriotic Front of  Liberia] seems to be involved in at least two conflicts that  continue to endanger any efforts to establish peace and hold  general elections in Liberia. Taylor claims he keeps getting  attacked by the Liberian Peace Council [LPC] in the southeast.  At the same time, the Armed Forces of Liberia, AFL, are  frequently involved in battles with the NPFL. The latest seems  to be control for the approaches to the port of Buchanan. From  Monrovia, Nii Nartey Allison telexed this report:    United Nations officials say the fighting started yesterday,  and that by this morning the NPFL had taken control of a section  of the Buchanan Highway around the Bible Industrial Academy.  According to ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States  Cease-Fire Monitoring Group], the highway is now closed to  civilian traffic. AFL defense spokesman Arthur Dennis says the  current round of fighting has broken out because Charles Taylor  has ordered his NPFL fighters to blow up all bridges on the  Buchanan Highway. Dennis claimed the NPFL had been beaten back  and he warned: Any further attacks on the AFL will force us to  pursue the NPFL all the way to their headquarters at Gbarnga.  Meanwhile, NPFL radio says Charles Taylor has ordered his  fighters to take up positions on the Buchanan Highway to prevent  the Liberian Peace Council from using this road to transport  weapons to its fighters.    Well, it is not only Charles Taylor who complains about the  activities of the LPC, who are not signatories of the Cotonou  Accord. Taylor claims the Nigerian contingent in ECOMOG is  supplying the LPC with arms. The human rights organizations are  unhappy with LPC's operations, and the United Nations'  representative, Trevor Gordon-Somers, last week expressed  concern about the LPC. Well, the LPC's chairman, (George  Boley), called us up and Robin White asked him what he made of  the allegations against the LPC.    [Begin recording] [(Boley)] Robin, let me make one thing  very clear. First of all, we have never received any supply of  arms and ammunition from ECOMOG, particularly not the Nigerian  ECOMOG. These are fabrications that are, you know, calculated to  destroy the reputation of ECOMOG. We made it clear: Many of  the weapons we capture are captured from the NPFL. They are our  main supply of arms and ammunition, seriously.    [White] But, it is not just Charles Taylor who is making  this accusation. Human rights groups are saying the same.    [(Boley)] Those human rights groups, Robin, that are making  these claims, don't know what they are talking about. When the  lady came, the Gail Fleischman -- whatever she is -- came to  Buchanan, she never ventured beyond LPC lines.    [White] But, even Mr. Gordon-Somers, a special UN  representative, he has expressed concern about your activities.    [(Boley)] Mr. Gordon-Somers is someone who does not know  precisely what he is doing in Liberia. Let me repeat, Mr.  Gordon-Somers is somebody who, by my judgment and perhaps the  judgment of many other Liberians, typically does not even know  the geography of this country, let alone what his mission is in  Liberia.    [White] So, you are, what, saying he is lying or just  ignorant?    [(Boley)] I think it is both.    [White] Have you been to see him?    [(Boley)] I have met Mr. Gordon Somers.    [White] And, what happened?    [(Boley)] Mr. Gordon Somers, as I said, does not seem to  know what he is doing. The man continues to be a part of a  propaganda machine against the LPC. We have informed Mr.  Gordon-Somers on many occasions what we are, and Mr.  Gordon-Somers continues to tell the world that the LPC continues  to attack the NPFL, which is not true.    [White] A lot of people wonder, Mr. (Boley), now, how come  it is that you have so suddenly sprung up and that you are so  well armed?    [(Boley)] Look, I have said to you.... [pauses] Let me put  this issue to rest once and for all, we have never received any  consignment of weapons from ECOMOG, generally, and from the  Nigerian ECOMOG, particularly. We are as armed as the NPFL. I  have told you, Mr. Taylor has been the major supply of our arms  and ammunition -- we captured his weapons in Greenville, Sinoe  County, we captured his arsenal in (Olak) -- and every other  place we have gone, NPFL is going to run, and NPFL has been our  major supplier. Yes, there is an embargo. How does Mr. Taylor  continue to get weapons even today? He cannot point any accusing  finger at anybody because he brought the arms in, we are simply  recipients of what he has brought into the country. [end  recording]</p>

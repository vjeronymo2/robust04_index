			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / Sweden awaits return of the 'hot money' SWEDEN'S commercial banks have a total of SKr46.6bn (Pounds 4.56bn) in borrowings outstanding from the Riksbank, the central bank, but the Riksbank's graduated ladder of interest rates means that only SKr1.6bn of these funds attract the top marginal rate which yesterday reached 76 per cent. A rate of 75 per cent applies to the next SKr4.4bn of borrowing. As the banks borrow more from the Riksbank, the higher rates of interest come into play. Each individual bank has its own interest rate scale which is set according to its capital base. Riksbank officials estimated that the average overnight lending rate would be about 22 to 24 per cent for banks borrowing from the central bank. The central bank governor, Mr Bengt Dennis, refused to comment on how long the marginal rate would be kept at such a high level. However, there was speculation in the financial market that the marginal rate may be lowered in stages after the weekend. The effect of the rise in the marginal rate was to push up money market rates, and draw so-called 'hot money' back to Sweden. Foreign and domestic investors bought Treasury bills and bought forward contracts on the Swedish krona in order to take advantage of the high returns currently available. Foreign and domestic investors were described as enthusiastic buyers of the Treasury bills during Wednesday and yesterday. The rate on three-month Treasury bills ended at 24 per cent yesterday. This compared with less than 15 per cent on September 1. The rate on six-month Treasury bills reached 19 per cent yesterday. The Riksbank said that investors had also been buying forward contracts on the Swedish krona in order to benefit from the difference in currency interest rates. According to Mr Dennis, the decision to raise the marginal rate to such high levels was intended 'to send a very strong signal to the market that we mean business' and to deter speculation in the currency.</p>

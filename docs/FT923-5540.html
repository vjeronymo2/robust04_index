			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / Books: Old found land VINLAND by George Mackay Brown John Murray Pounds 14.95 AS a chronicler of community, the Orcadian poet George Mackay Brown has few peers. An Orkney Tapestry and A Portrait of Orkney are easily the best introductions to those islands. His short stories - A Time to Keep, followed by the collections Andrina, Hawkfall and The Masked Fisherman - capture, as perhaps no-one else could, 12 centuries of island continuity and change. Vinland is Mackay Brown's fourth full-length novel. His first, Greenvoe, coupled a Dylan Thomas-like skill at charting small-town life with a scathing attack on 'progress' in the form of uranium mining (set to music in Peter Maxwell Davies's cantata Black Pentecost). It is when he dwells, with a kind of Homeric empathy, on the follies of man-made destruction or the shifting cross-currents of historical change that Brown most powerfully hits his mark. The title is perhaps a misnomer. Like its predecessor, Magnus, to which it forms a sort of spiritual prelude, Vinland (the title derives from the Norse sagas of that name) is set as much in Brown's native Orkney as on the sea paths that lured the Vikings to North America. Were it not for the opening chapter one might surmise the place never existed, except in the mind's eye. Mackay Brown's Vinland is a land of lost content - an Elysium, with echoes of Swift and Defoe, briefly glimpsed, never-forgotten. Stowing away on board Leif Erickson's longboat during his celebrated voyage, an Orkney boy, Ranald Sigmundson, alights on the coast of Newfoundland, where he and the crew encounter a peaceable indigenous Indian community whom they term 'Skraelings', or savages. Primitivism strikes a chord and returning to 'civilisation' - the intrigues of Norse and Scottish politics - Ranald reviews his Odyssey with growing nostalgia, withdraws from court bickering, settles down and turns to the images of Christianity as a source of renewal - a Grail for a system that reeks of blood-lust and decay. If the sentences are unhurried, the adventure itself shifts at arrow speed. The youth retrieves a family estate, fights the Irish near Dublin, and narrowly escapes to befriend a homicidal outcast, a Norse King and his vassals, the EarIs of Orkney. Ranald's growth to maturity is set alongside the gradual ascendancy of Catholicism. Europe is on the brink of change. A new era beckons. Mackay Brown not only brings saga vividly to life but is equally at home with allegorical writing, akin to Hesse (Narziss und Goldmund) or Thomas Mann (The Holy Sinner). But while the climax to his last novel, Time in a Red Coat, served to sum up and focus an extended narrative, Vinland's slightly self-conscious philosophical peroration seems rather less successful than the narrative itself in underscoring Ranald's emotive shift from heroics to asceticism. Brown's poetry, esteemed alongside Scottish writers - Muir, McDiarmid, Dunn, Norman McCaig - permeates his novels. 'Slow pulsings go through the elements of sea and land'; 'The moon has gone into her cave with her pot of ashes and her quenched candle-stump'; 'His beard a galaxy of tears'. Images are carefully sustained, whether the recurrent Hindu notion of life as a threadbare coat, or the ship itself, figuratively inverted into the nave of an island church. The characterisation is simple, but accomplished. Some might find such epic textures irksome. Those attuned to Mackay Brown's work will appreciate Vinland as more than just a good yarn. The adventurous reader, charting unfamiliar territory, will be amply rewarded.</p>

			<p><P> June 1, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 3 APPOINTED TO 'CLEANSE' TEAMSTERS OF CORRUPTION  </P> <P> A well-respected former federal judge, an aggressive ex-Wall Street prosecutor  and a highly regarded labor lawyer were named Wednesday to oversee the  operations of the scandal-ridden Teamsters Union as part of the settlement of  an unprecedented civil racketeering suit against the 1.6-million-member union.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge David N. Edelstein announced the appointments of the  overseers at a brief hearing in New York. He said the appointments were an  "important first step" in "cleansing the union of corrupt influences and  establishing democratic self governance."  </P> <P> Frederick B. Lacey, a former federal judge and U.S. attorney in New Jersey,  will serve as administrator of the union until late in 1991.  </P> <P> Charles M. Carberry, former head of the commodities and securities fraud unit  in the U.S. Attorney's office in New York and spearhead of insider trading  prosecutions against Ivan F. Boesky, Dennis B. Levine and Martin A. Siegel, was  tapped to serve as an "investigations officer" for the union, with the power to  bring charges against union officials and employees.  </P> <P> Michael H. Holland, a Chicago labor lawyer and former general counsel of the  United Mine Workers of America, was picked to supervise Teamster elections in  1990 and 1991.  </P> <P> On March 14, Judge Edelstein approved a consent decree to settle a massive  civil racketeering suit the Justice Department had filed against the union in  June, 1988. The suit alleged that the union, three of whose presidents had been  convicted of federal crimes and sent to prison, was dominated by organized  crime and had "made a devil's pact" with the Mafia.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Agree to Reforms  </P> <P> The consent decree settling the suit left most of the union's top officials,  including President William J. McCarthy, in place. In exchange, though,  Teamster officials agreed to change the union's constitution to permit direct  election of the union's top officers and to allow three court-appointed  officials to oversee its operations and elections for the next two years.  </P> <P> "The public has a significant stake in the outcome of the decree," Judge  Edelstein said Wednesday. The Teamsters Union "exercises vast power and cuts  across every segment of society. It affects every aspect of our lives. Such  power must be insulated against corruption and criminal elements. . . . "  </P> <P> Lacey, 68, a former U.S. attorney and federal district court judge in Newark,  will have the power to discipline and fire Teamster officials, appoint  temporary trustees to run local unions and veto proposed union expenditures.  Harold N. Ackerman, a federal district judge in Newark who handled a major  racketeering case the government brought against a large New Jersey Teamster  local, praised Lacey as having been an "outstanding prosecutor and one of the  finest federal judges in the country."  </P> <P> sh Has Broad Authority  </P> <P> Carberry, 38, now a partner in the New York office of Jones, Day, Reavis &amp;  Pogue, one of the nation's largest law firms, will have broad authority to  investigate alleged instances of corruption in the union. "He'll do a very good  job," said Ira Lee Sorkin, former director of the New York office of the  Securities and Exchange Commission.  </P> <P> Holland, 42, has had experience in direct referendum elections for union  officials during his tenure at the Mine Workers, one of the few unions in the  country that directly elects its top officials.  </P> <P> Researcher Charles Hirshberg in New York contributed to this story.  </P></p>

			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Clinton shrugs off sex and money smears President Bill Clinton's popularity has rebounded to levels close to those he enjoyed shortly after assuming office, according to a new opinion poll by the Washington Post and ABC News. A string of victories in Congress, notably the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Brady handgun control bill, and an improving economy were the principal reasons for a rise in his approval rating to 58 per cent from the 50 per cent range of the previous three months. The high point of his year was the 63 per cent of February and his nadir 43 per cent in June in the survey's findings. At least one other poll has recorded a comparable improvement. On three specific counts he reversed poll results of November. His handling of the economy was approved by 53-44 per cent, against 43-50 per cent, of foreign affairs by 49-44 per cent (39-53 per cent) and crime 49-45 per cent (39-52 per cent.) Only in the west, where California is still stuck in recession, was his management of the economy disapproved, by 44-50 per cent. Mr Clinton's end-year rating is nothing like as high as Presidents Kennedy and Bush, who both recorded more than 70 per cent after their first 12 months in office, but it is comparable to President Carter's (57 per cent) and above President Reagan's (49 per cent). Ironically, in some respects Mr Clinton is winding up 1993 much as he started it. Retired Admiral Bobby Ray Inman, the secretary of defence-designate, has admitted failing to pay social security taxes for household help, an offence that undid the chances of Ms Zoe Baird and Judge Kimba Wood becoming attorney general. The prevailing Washington view, however, is that neither this, nor his less than glittering record as a businessman over the last decade, will disqualify him from taking office. 'Nannygate,' in particular, seems to have been last winter's catharsis. Charges of Mr Clinton's extra-marital affairs have also resurfaced in a right wing magazine and been picked up by the tabloid press, some television networks and conservative talk show programmes. But the suspect nature of his accusers in Arkansas, one a long-time political enemy representing two state troopers apparently in pursuit of a lucrative book contract, has induced extreme circumspection to date in the heavyweight media. A more persistent story concerns a real estate investment by the Clintons in Arkansas in the mid-1980s. The White House said on Monday night that a file covering details of financial transactions between the Clintons and their principal partner, who ran a now-defunct savings and loan operation, had not gone missing but was with the Clintons' lawyers.</p>

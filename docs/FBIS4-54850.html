			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "SME-r": "Trust in Politicians in Slovakia in </F> April 1994"]    [Text] Bratislava--In a public opinion poll surveying  trust in individual personalities of political life in Slovakia  that the Slovak Statistical Office carried out on 1 to 8 April  1994, 1,287 respondents above age 18 were asked to reply to the  question: "Which politician operating in the Slovak Republic at  present enjoys your trust?" Each respondent was able to cite  three personalities. The mosaic of trustworthy politician was  made up of 70 names, 11 of whom received more than 3 percent.  The poll revealed another decline (by 18 percent since  February) in the group of those who do not trust anyone.    Vladimir Meciar enjoys trust among Movement for a Democratic  Slovakia [HZDS] sympathizers (83 percent) and Slovak National  Party [SNS] sympathizers (39 percent); Jozef Moravcik among  Bratislava residents (48 percent), Party of the Democratic Left  [SDL] sympathizers (37 percent), Christian Democratic Movement  [KDH] sympathizers (40 percent), Alternative of Political  Realism [APR] sympathizers (76 percent), respondents with  complete secondary education (30 percent) and university  education (35 percent), as well as among white-collar workers  (32 percent). President Michal Kovac is trusted by SDL  sympathizers (30 percent), KDH sympathizers (43 percent), APR  sympathizers (45 percent), citizens of Hungarian nationality (44  percent), and respondents with university education (33 percent).    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Trust in Representatives of Political Life inSlovakia, as Expressed by Cit-|  |izens in Apr 1994(in percent)                                              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |Feb 1994          |Mar 1994          |Apr 1994          |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Vladimir Meciar   |22                |25                |26                |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Jozef Moravcik    |5                 |5                 |25                |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Michal Kovac      |20                |25                |25                |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Peter Weiss       |15                |16                |13                |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Ivan Gasparovic   |8                 |7                 |10                |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Roman Kovac       |5                 |3                 |7                 |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Jozef Prokes      |5                 |5                 |5                 |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Jan Carnogursky   |5                 |6                 |4                 |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Rudolf Filkus     |1                 |1                 |4                 |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Ludovit Cernak    |3                 |4                 |3                 |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Bela Bugar        |2                 |3                 |3                 |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Does not trust an-|43                |31                |25                |  |y politician      |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Note: Table lists only the names of those politicians who were trusted by  |  |at least 3 percent in April 1994.

Facsimile and telegraphic applications are not authorized and will not be considered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HUD also encourages an applicant to submit a copy of the application to the HA for the jurisdiction in which the RC/RMC/RO is located.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III.

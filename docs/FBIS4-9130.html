			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Z. Petrov: "Is Only Big Money at Stake?"] </F>   [Text] In Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia -- FYROM] there exists a real hunger for arms.  According to psychologists and sociologists, the reason for  such an enormous increase in interest for these kinds of objects  for taking human lives lies in the rising uncertainty of the  citizens for their personal security, as well as in the  psychological determination preconditioned by the military  activities in our close and not-so-close region. One of the  most common examples of the enormous interest of the citizens in  the purchase of arms are the long queues in the Interior  Ministry department for issuing permits to carry and possess  arms. As a matter of fact, the shops selling these "goods" are  the ones that are the most visited in Skopje. The shopkeepers  say that guns, firearms, hunting knives, and "Rambo" knives are  the most popular.    In other words, arms are slowly becoming an indispensable  tool for the new businessmen, politicians, and often for common  people, too, who are ready to pay 1,000 German marks [DM] or  more to purchase a good "Magnum," "Beretta," or the somewhat  cheaper "Zbrojovka," "Zastava," or "TT." In a way, one can  somehow understand the interest in firearms for personal  protection reasons, such as the guns and pistols for which there  is a legal regulation for carrying and possessing (the permit  issued by the Interior Ministry). The problem arises when we  talk about light infantry armaments -- automatic rifles, machine  guns, mortars, bombs, mines, or sniper rifles, in which case we  cannot speak of a traditional Balkan love for "shooting" or  self-protection. Even at weddings, when only until recently guns  and pistols were fired, we now often hear the firing of  automatic weapons as if it were a real front line. Wherever  there are arms, there are unprofessional handlers (there was  such a case two years ago when a citizen was killed while a  person was shooting dogs with an automatic rifle), but there are  also real professionals, that is eliminators, as was the case of  the triple murder in Strumica.    The police reports say that last year 42 cases (there were  39  in 1992) of illegal trading and possession of explosives were  discovered. Then (in 1993) four machine guns, 34 automatic  rifles, 33 bombs, a mine, 8,532 rounds of different ammunition,  6,290 grams of explosives, 112 meters of slow burning fuse cord,  72 powder cartridges, and 50 explosive fuses were taken from 92  persons. In most of the cases the arms were bought through  different channels from Bosnia and Herzegovina, from Croatia, as  well as from the arsenal of the former Yugoslav People's Army,  from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.    Speaking about the illegal arms trade, it is a well-known  fact that they can be purchased at almost all greater market  places in Macedonia, and the prices for these "assortments" are  not a secret at all. "Kalashnikovs," for instance, can be  purchased from DM1,500-2,000 apiece, but if greater quantity is  bought, the price is drastically decreased. Automatic rifles of  the types "Makarov" or "Scorpio" can be bought for  DM1,000-1,500; pistols and semiautomatic pistols, depending on  the model and the year of production, cost from DM400-1,000; a  bomb sells for DM50; while the average price for ammunition is  DM1 per round, again depending on the kind of weapon it is used  for.    What is especially indicative in the context of arms  smuggling is the fact that most often they end up in western  Macedonia. As a matter of fact, it is no secret that the  citizens of Albanian nationality are the constantly hungry  market for weapons, and they are the greatest customers of the  illegal arms trade. The big actions of the Interior Ministry in  the Struga village of Radolista of a year and a half ago, as  well as the recent action in Gostivar, connected to the  "all-Albanian paramilitary army," indicated the last station for  smuggled arms, because aside from the common automatic rifles  which are usually supplied from Albania (the Chinese version of  the "Kalashnikov"), bombs were also discovered, as well as radio  stations, mobilization lists, literature, uniforms....    In spite of the rigorous fines, according to which criminal  charges become unavoidable, it is a fact that arms are coming  into our country from all sides. The statistical data related  to the phenomenon called illegal import and possession of arms  indicate a tendency toward continual rise, and the number of  these criminal acts is constantly increasing. It is a social  problem, with further serious political implications, because it  is not just necessary to stop an illegal profitable business,  but a potential powder keg which can explode at any time.  Ultimately, the danger can be clearly viewed in the fact that  nobody in the state knows the psychological stability or mental  balance of each one of those carrying a "Colt," a "Magnum," a  "Smith &amp; Wesson," or a "Walther" under the coat.</p>

But this view  is certainly not endorsed by all. Mr. Ch'en Shao-kan [7115  1421 1949], Secretary General of the Hong Kong Productivity  Council, holds that since Hong Kong's industry has moved north,  industry has not only not become less important to Hong Kong,  but is growing increasingly important instead. So we have  these two absolutely differing views involving different  understandings of the manufacturing industry and different views  on its position. Mr. Ch'en Shao-kan favors a new and correct  understanding of the manufacturing industry, with a continued  upgrading of the production capacity of Hong Kong's  manufacturing industry, so that Hong Kong can develop along with  southern China into a world-class manufacturing center.    Hong Kong's economic structure has undergone a great change  in the last two or three decades. In the 1950s and 1960s, Hong  Kong changed from an entrepot-trade port to an export-oriented,  light-industrial manufacturing center. Then in the 1970s, it  turned to diversified development, with a rising financial  industry, so that Hong Kong became one of the world's key  financial and service centers.    Particularly in the last 15 years, along with China's reform  and opening, Hong Kong's economic structure has once more seen  new changes. In order to lower production costs, a stream of  Hong Kong industrialists have moved their plants to inland  China, to exploit China's cheap manpower and land resources in  the service of Hong Kong's manufacturing industry. Hong Kong  manufacturers now have more than 6,000 independently run or  joint-venture plants in Guangdong which, in addition to many  other types of projects, employ about 3 million workers, or five  times the number in Hong Kong's manufacturing industry.  Meanwhile, Hong Kong's entrepot trade is flourishing again.  Hong Kong is now the world's tenth largest trade zone, with  its industrial and commercial development stimulating further  growth of its financial and service industries.    This is precisely why many experts and academics, and even  the Hong Kong government, all hold that Hong Kong's economy has  now been converted to mostly service industries, or that Hong  Kong has become a service-type economy.    As to this view, Mr. Ch'en Shao-kan, Secretary General of  the  Hong Kong Productivity Council, and Dr. Huo Ting-yang [7202 1353  3152], an official in the design and automation sector, have  various differences.  <H5>  Is the Manufacturing Industry in Hong Kong Not Important? </H5>   At a meeting with inland experts, they said: In Hong Kong,  many hold that since Hong Kong's production process has been  moved north, Hong Kong has gradually become a service-type  society, with the manufacturing industry of increasingly less  importance to Hong Kong's economy, which argument is of great  concern. If Hong Kong turns into a service society, Hong  Kong's economy may become "hollowed out," which would not be in  line with Hong Kong's interests. In fact, as to Hong Kong's  current situation since its factories have been moved inland,  the manufacturing industry remains increasingly important to  Hong Kong's economy for the following reason. While Hong Kong  products used to be basically assembled in Hong Kong (the  process has now been moved to southern China), Hong Kong  manufacturers have certainly not abandoned industrial  production, but are simply putting more emphasis on aspects,  such as product design, manufacturing design, industrial-pattern  manufacturing, parts deals, and packing. It could be said that  if Hong Kong did not have an industrial-production manufacturing  capability, the current factory growth in the Zhu Jiang [Pearl  River] Delta zone would not necessarily be in its current state.  Even more importantly, Hong Kong plays a role as an  industrial-support port, doing all that it does for industrial  production, a role that is still not reflected in any  statistical data.  <H3>  How Do We Distinguish the Manufacturing From the Service  Industry? </H3>   This point also illustrates the confusion and narrowness in  Hong Kong's definition of the manufacturing industry. For  instance, in the current manufacturing industry, employees are  differentiated by all in-factory sanitation workers and  accounting personnel being listed as manufacturing-industry  employees, while product designers in offices are often listed  as service personnel. Such a statistical method is very  primitive and backward, unable to reflect the current state of  economic development. The manufacturing industry certainly does  not refer to assembly and processing alone, as the assembly  costs for higher-precision products generally make up less than  10 percent of overall cost, with manufacturing being a process  of turning raw materials into components, and then components  into manufactured products. The work of a comprehensive  manufacturing enterprise includes all processes, such as R&amp;D,  design, tool assembly, material selection, component purchasing,  quality control, assembly, packing, and retail sales. As  manufacturing operations become increasingly precise and  diverse, such "service" components of the production process  increase correspondingly.  <H3>  Is It Not More Suitable To Say That Hong Kong Is a  Comprehensive Manufacturing Center? </H3>   It should be said that Hong Kong is now developing from a  simple assembly center into a more complete  comprehensive-manufacturing center. From this perspective, it  can be said that China and Hong Kong are beginning to evolve a  division of labor in which the Zhu Jiang Delta zone handles most  assembly operations, while Hong Kong is responsible for  preparatory work and later storage, such as marketing,  dissemination, purchasing, product development, design, and  quality engineering, as well as services, such as final product  quality and retail sales. This preparatory work and after  service sharply raises the added value of products produced  through assembly in China.    Taking stock of the economic development of various  countries, particularly the United States and Japan, they had  already moved their labor-intensive industries as long as two to  three decades ago to low-cost zones, such as Hong Kong and  Southeast Asia, emphasing the upgrading of their own technology  and continuing control of their outside planned development. So  Japan remains a very successful industrial nation.    There is not much difference in the route taken now by Hong  Kong in moving some labor-intensive industries to the mainland  and that taken by the United States and Japan two to three  decades ago, the only one being that the United States and Japan  still emphasize that they are industrial nations, while Hong  Kong says that it will and has developed into a service center.  But the reality is that Hong Kong's industry has not been  "hollowed out" or made responsible for goods flow alone due to  the move north, with Hong Kong still in control of design and  production technology, and responsible for technology flow. And  it is only by controlling these key links that that it can  promote industrial development in the Zhu Jiang Delta zone.  <H5>  Should the Emphasis Be On Conversion or Added Value? </H5>   From another perspective, the crucial issue is not whether  the economy should be converted, but rather whether added value  can be increased. If the industrial conversion to service trades  increases added value, this will be a good thing, but if added  value drops instead, this will certainly be bad. The U.S. is  certainly now experiencing the problem of its industry being  "hollowed out," with its secondary industries being converted to  tertiary ones with lower added value. U.S. wages show that an  ordinary service worker makes about $40 a day, while the daily  wage for manufacturing industry workers is $66, with it being  very hard for workers eliminated from manufacturing jobs to find  comparable new ones, as manufacturing wages are higher. This  shows that added value is lower in U.S. tertiary industries.    Another example is post-production semiconductor assembly, a  labor-intensive industry for the United States, which, as far  back as the 1960s, was transferred to places such as Hong Kong  and Southeast Asia. So Americans today absolutely do not know  how to package semiconductors, no longer having such technology.  Japan is different, in that while it similarly moved  labor-intensive industries abroad in the 1960s and 1970s, it  kept high added-value production, such as packaging, at home.  In other words, while Japan, like the United States, moved its  low added-value industries abroad, it never "hollowed out" its  own industry, always keeping its highest technology on Japanese  soil. Although the United States designed the notebook  computer, it does not have high-precision electronic-assembly  technology, so cannot produce it. But as Japan has this  technology, it can design and produce it. Even Taiwan and Hong  Kong can design and produce the notebook computer, as Hong Kong  has learned these technologies over a period of time.    The crux of the matter is that the distinction between the  manufacturing and service industries is certainly growing  increasingly blurred, with the need for care being the  added-value issue. While certain service added value in  support of manufacturing is quite high, the added value of the  service industry alone is lower. When service industries are now  mentioned, many think first of finance, commerce, service  trades, catering, and tourism.... Taking the financial industry  as an example, while its added value is not low, it provides  very few jobs, meaning that not many can serve in finance. As  Hong Kong's overall economy needs to grow, it will always need  manufacturing growth.  <H3>  Does Dealing Well With Accumulated Manufacturing Experience  Concern Only Hong Kong? </H3>   It finally needs to be pointed out that Hong Kong should  continue to raise the production capacity of its own  manufacturing industry. In this area, Hong Kong is ahead of  China, having accumulated rich experience. So if Hong Kong  strives to become a service society, no longer engaging in  industrial-production manufacturing, this would mean abandoning  all of its accumulated experience, which would have to be called  a waste of resources, as well as a regrettable matter.    It is obvious that the rapid growth of southern China's  economy is due to Hong Kong's having moved its long-accumulated  experience there to benefit southern China too. So continued  investment in Hong Kong industry will continue to move Hong  Kong's production ahead, actually also continuing to promote  China's development.    As Hong Kong's human and land resources are now inadequate,  with S&amp;T forces also not rich, which might become limiting  factors shortly, if Hong Kong and the southern China region can  link up closely to form an integrated economic region, most of  Hong Kong's resource limitations can be resolved through  reciprocal supplementation, mutual benefit, and joint  development. Hong Kong is now in an advantageous position, so  should do all it can to provide the management and S&amp;T  needed to  develop this economic region into a world-class manufacturing  center, in order to bring its economic potential and impact into  full play.</p>

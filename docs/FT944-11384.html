			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / TUC demands Pounds 1bn boost for employment The government should spend Pounds 1.15bn on measures to cut unemployment, raising the money required from the abolition of tax relief on profit-related pay schemes and a crackdown on tax evasion, the Trades Union Congress says in its Budget submission published today. The submission represents a significant shift in union thought, with its emphasis on the theme of 'making benefits work for the unemployed'. It has tried to break from previous practice by not drawing up a list of demands that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, would dismiss. The TUC is trying to exercise an influence by suggesting measures which would go with, rather than against, the grain of government policy. Mr John Monks, TUC general secretary, said that unions shared the views of the chancellor and the Confederation of British Industry, that 'the welfare state should be helping the unemployed into jobs and training'. The TUC proposals include calls for: A reduction in the poverty and unemployment trap caused by the loss of benefit as earnings rise. A cut in the tax rates on workers earning more than Pounds 57 a week by the abolition of the 2 per cent National Insurance entry fee. A reduction in employers' National Insurance contributions as an incentive to create more low-paid jobs. The introduction of a training levy on all employers with lower National Insurance contributions for those achieving Investors in People status. The provision of subsidies for employers to take on long-term jobless. The submission quotes pointedly from Mr Clarke's Mais lecture earlier this year, in which he said a strong welfare state could 'complement, not hinder, flexible markets by reducing fear of change and opposition to it'. Mr Monks said: 'We have presented him with a mutually reinforcing package of proposals that the present government could implement.' Other proposals include: a Pounds 300m increase in funding of income support and family credit; Pounds 750m more for child benefit which would remain available for all families; Pounds 100m for higher benefits for those on training programmes, as well as stabilising public investment at its present levels as a share of national income. The last would provide an extra Pounds 12bn over three years, creating 300,000 jobs, the TUC said. Meanwhile, in an interview on GMTV, Mr Monks eased union pressure on Labour to commit itself to a minimum wage of more than Pounds 4 an hour. Mr Monks backed the long-standing formula of Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, that the level of the the minimum wage should be set 'in the light of the economic circumstances at the time'.</p>

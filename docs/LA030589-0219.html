			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 30 TRANSLATORS TELL IMMIGRANT PARENTS HOW TO HELP CHILDREN  </P> <P> About 250 eager learners flocked to Rincon Intermediate School last Saturday,  but they weren't trying to chalk up extra credit. They were parents attending a  Rowland Unified School District conference on ways to give their children a  boost in school.  </P> <P> And they were learning in their native tongues.  </P> <P> Some 30 translators with command of Spanish, Mandarin, Korean and Tagalog (for  those from the Philippines) helped fill classrooms of the West Covina school  with a cacophony of sound.  </P> <P> Clusters of parents sat at tables around their respective translators during  most of the lectures, usually conducted in English. Groups of parents would  murmur, nod their heads in agreement and sometimes laugh a step or two behind  the rest, after hearing the punch line in their language.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Orientation to Society  </P> <P> The daylong Multilingual Parent University was the first districtwide parent  workshop sponsored by the 19,000-student district, which includes Rowland  Heights and portions of La Puente, Walnut and West Covina.  </P> <P> The workshop was intended mainly as an orientation to American society for the  district's ethnically diverse community, said Anaida Colon-Muniz, bilingual  education coordinator for the district.  </P> <P> Participants were given a package of curriculum summaries in English and  Spanish, referral sources for psychological and drug treatment services, and  brochures on parents' responsibilities in education.  </P> <P> Colon-Muniz noted that the student population has undergone "a tremendous  change" in ethnic composition over the past two decades.  </P> <P> The percentage of Latinos attending the 21 schools in the district has nearly  doubled from 26% in 1970 to 46% today, while Asians increased from 5.3% to 22%  in the same period.  </P> <P> The workshop was the brainchild of Supt. Sharon Robison, who had a survey  conducted in five languages last year to find out what topics parents would be  most interested in hearing about.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Drugs and Gangs  </P> <P> About 26 speakers explored issues such as school culture, choices other than  college, communicating with children, and parenting in America.  </P> <P> Gus Frias, coordinator of Operation Safe School, an Orange County Department of  Education anti-gang program, addressed the problems of drugs, gangs and peer  pressure. Social worker Nancy Lin from McClaren Children's Center spoke in  Mandarin about how to talk to children about school.  </P> <P> Some parents asked how to approach sex education. Others did not understand  their children's new-found rebelliousness.  </P> <P> "I told them to insist on the big things," Lin said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> More Workshops  </P> <P> Another speaker, Howard Kwon, advised immigrant parents to overcome feelings of  powerlessness in a strange country and to not give their children too much  freedom. The Korea-born Kwon is the special programs coordinator for the ABC  Unified School District, with headquarters in Cerritos.  </P> <P> "Respecting parents -- we need to import that," Kwon told his listeners.  "Fathers have the responsibility to guide."  </P> <P> Among his audience in a Chinese-speaking cluster was Meng-I Pan, whose son  arrived last fall from Taiwan. The kindergartener is struggling to learn  English.  </P> <P> "He hasn't been here very long, so I want to help him understand the school  environment," she said in Mandarin, adding that it was great having  translators.  </P> <P> "I wish they would have more (workshops) so I can learn more things," said  Lourdes Vasquez. The mother of a first-grader at Northam Elementary School in  La Puente, she left Mexico for California a decade ago.  </P> <P> She was pleased that her group got to watch a Spanish video on the possible  reasons why a child misbehaves, while others watched a similar tape in English.  Vasquez said she learned that she should calm down and talk to her children  before getting angry at them for putting off doing homework.  </P> <P> Samantha Moon, who emigrated from Korea six years ago, said she had learned a  lot. She said she picked up valuable tips on ways to encourage her two  elementary school-age sons to do their homework, such as reading with them  instead of watching television.  </P> <P> The workshop was also an effort to sensitize educators to the diversity they  face, said Sally Mentor, associate superintendent of educational services.  </P> <P> "Face-to-face contact is a powerful reminder of how much our community has  changed," she said.  </P> <P> Mentor is developing a seven-hour cultural training program for administrators  and staff this fall.  </P> <P> She said the district is concerned with issues deeper than obvious cultural  differences such as dance or music.  </P> <P> Using videotaped interviews with students and parents, her program will explore  different gender expectations, how discipline is handled at home and how  communications between schools and the home can be improved.  </P> <P> Communication is essential because sometimes parents do not understand what  certain classes may involve, she said. For example, she said some parents were  shocked when their children performed at the end of a modern dance class.  </P> <P> "They were moving their bodies in ways that in some cultures are totally  unacceptable," Mentor said, adding that some parents were also surprised simply  to see the dancers in tights.  </P></p>

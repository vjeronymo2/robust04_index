			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Survey of Jersey (16): Natural beauty is main attraction - The locals love their island and this clearly shows in its cleanliness and the cherished appearance of homes and gardens. The pace is slow and people make time to talk / Where to go and what to see The problem facing the visitor to Jersey is not what to do, but what to miss out. The island is small enough for easy and leisurely exploring, while surprisingly full of places of interest and activities to suit most tastes. Undoubtedly Jersey's main attraction is its natural beauty. Packed into 45 square miles - 63 square miles at very low tide - are long sandy beaches, cliff-bound little coves, small fishing harbours, hedgerows and fields full of wild flowers, small farm fields with neat rows of vegetables or a few Jersey cows, and winding country lanes shaded by trees. Jersey is often referred to as the floral island and its climate ensures a constant and wide variety of plant life. The locals love their island and this clearly shows in its cleanliness and the cherished appearance of homes and gardens. The pace is slow and people make time to talk. Tucked away in St. Mary is La Mare Vineyards, with 5 1/2 acres of vines. The warm granite buildings date in part back to the 1600s and visitors can sample produce at a wine-tasting and enjoy home-made food in the Buttery. Wines and cider are on sale at the vineyard as well as a mouth-watering selection of mustards and preserves, all home made. This year's addition to the range is 'Jersey Lightning' - a potent spirit distilled from cider in a copper pot-still, not unlike Calvados. A different type of distilling goes on at Jersey Lavender Farm in St. Brelade. Seven acres of lavender fields are harvested to obtain essential oil used in the farm's selection of cosmetic products. Visitors can walk around the lavender and herb fields and watch the distilling and bottling process. About 55 varieties of lavender are grown here, which comprise one of the national collections of plants approved by the National Council for the Conservation of Plants and Gardens. A range of products are on sale and Jersey cream teas are served in these fragrant surroundings. Herb enthusiasts will want to visit Samares Manor in St. Clement. It has one of the largest herb gardens in Britain, with more than 100 varieties planted out. Talks on herbs are given in the garden most afternoons and potted herbs can be bought at the shop. Samares also has other well-designed gardens to wander round, including a water garden and a Japanese garden. Carnations are grown commercially in Jersey and a visit to Jersey Flower Centre at Retreat Farm, St. Lawrence, will allow the visitor a view of the whole production cycle, up to packaging and posting of mail order bunches. This is the largest carnation-growing nursery in Britain and its mail order section, Flying Flowers, was recently listed on the stock exchange. Animal lovers will find that Jersey Zoo is a unique centre for breeding rare and endangered species of animals in captivity. Founded in 1963 by author Gerald Durrell, the zoo is now home to such animals as aye-ayes, lemurs and giant jumping rats. Visitors always enjoy the families of orang-utans and lowland gorillas, one of which achieved world fame by his protection of a young visitor who fell into the enclosure. Visitors interested in the island's history do best to start at the award-winning Jersey Museum in St. Helier. The museum's audio-visual presentation and exhibitions act as a gateway to further explorations. There are sites, monuments and castles to visit dating from prehistoric time through to modern history. The German occupation of Jersey during the last war is well illustrated at several sites, but probably most prominently at the German Underground Hospital in St. Lawrence. Regarded as the most ambitious engineering feat of the occupation, it now vividly brings to life the experiences of thousands of islanders at that time. Jersey offers a wide choice of accommodation and the authorities ensure standards are kept up. Prices per night range from Pounds 13 for accommodation only in a small guest-house, to Pounds 300 for a suite in a five-sun (the Jersey official rating) hotel. For visitors wanting to be in St. Helier, the Pomme d'Or on the waterfront offers excellent three-sun facilities - 147 bedrooms, two restaurants, a coffee shop, a pub and easy access to both harbour and town centre. Longueville Manor, just outside St. Helier, is the island's only five-sun hotel, named Egon Ronay hotel of the year in 1991. Prices for a room per night range from Pounds 110 for a single to Pounds 300 for a suite. Country lovers will appreciate the four-sun Chateau La Chaire in the Rozel Valley. Oak panelling, antique furniture, more than eight acres of grounds and a cuisine renowned throughout the island combine to give the guest an experience not dissimilar to that of staying in a really comfortable country house. Prices range from about Pounds 50 to Pounds 180 per night, depending on accommodation and time of year. The standard of cuisine generally throughout the island is high, with seafood a speciality in many restaurants. A favourite with both visitors and locals is the Dolphin (also a two-sun hotel) on the edge of the little fishing harbour of Gorey, beneath the dramatic Mont Orgueil Castle. From about Pounds 20 per head for a full meal, the delights of Jersey seafood can be enjoyed in very appropriate surroundings.</p>

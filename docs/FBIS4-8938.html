			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Bratislava SMENA in Slovak on 16 April  on page 12 carries a 200-word TA SR report entitled "CNN  Protests." The report states that the U.S. Cable News Network  (CNN) company, which is one of the applicants for a license to  broadcast on the STV (Slovak Television) 2 channel, which is to  be partly privatized, "accused Slovak legislators of  discriminating against foreign companies in the competition for  a license to broadcast on the second Slovak Television channel."  Bratislava PRAVDA in Slovak on 18 April on page 1, under the  headline "Discrimination in the Law on Tenders?," carries a  200-word TA SR report on Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik's  response to the CNN complaint.    According to the Bratislava SMENA report, in a letter  addressed to the Slovak parliament, the prime minister, and the  president, CNN said that, "by setting four new conditions for  license applicants, Slovakia has signaled that it is not  interested in foreign capital" and charged that "the approach by  the Slovak Council for Radio and Television Broadcasting  discourages foreign investors and suggests that they are not  welcome here." The CNN letter was referring to new  requirements, under which foreign stake in the license holder's  company must not exceed 45 percent and under which the license  holder must reserve 50 percent of broadcasting time for European  productions.    The Bratislava PRAVDA report on Prime Minister Moravcik's  reaction states that "the Government of the Slovak Republic is  greatly interested in the observance of general customs, which  are also laid down in our legal system, concerning competitions  and public tenders. It is from this point of view that we will  assess the whole matter surrounding the report on the CNN  letter." Moravcik announces that the government will "assume an  official standpoint" after it has familiarized itself with "the  whole case."</p>

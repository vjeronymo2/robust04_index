			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / The City Bombing: Glaziers flock to the 'bazaar' GLAZIERS were the first beneficiaries yesterday as an army of construction workers began clearing up hundreds of tonnes of broken glass and rubble. Some companies were called within minutes of the bomb going off. Central Glazing was called almost immediately by Libra Litho in St Botolph Street and Union Discount Company in Cornhill, and was at work on Saturday afternoon. Many glaziers turned up on spec to tout for work, pressing business cards into the hands of anybody who would take them. One observer said: 'It is like a bazaar down there.' A woman answering the phone at Plate Glass yesterday said there was nobody to take the call because all the vans were out. 'The drivers went out as soon as they heard of the explosion on the radio. They did not wait for customers to contact them but went out chasing work.' The first task has been to remove broken glass and board up empty windows. Some customers may have to wait until today before assessing the extent of damage to their windows. Workmen were yesterday busy removing acres of broken glass from the roof of Liverpool Street station. British Rail estimated damage at Pounds 250,000. Hayes Glass said it had gone out on Saturday to assist a long-standing client, one of the Bill Bentley wine bars in the City, but had been prevented by police from entering the area. It ended up boarding up the seven floors of windows of a nearby bank building. Companies such as Hayes are likely to be busy again today, and for some time to come.</p>

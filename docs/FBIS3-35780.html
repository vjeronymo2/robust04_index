"Meshkov has two modes of action before him:  either really to begin to fulfil his election campaign promises,  which may lead to a considerable complication of the situation  on the peninsula and around it or come to see that talks almost  on a par with presidents Boris Yeltsin and Leonid Kravchuk,  provided a certain status quo is observed, are much more  preferable than the role of the leader of an embattled enclave".  At the same time the newspaper's correspondent points out that  much in the Crimean president's position depends on Moscow. "If  Russia makes it clear to the Crimean president that his speedy  drift to Russian borders will hardly be viewed positively and if  it becomes clear to the Crimea that its economic position will  worsen rather than improve in the event of a conflict with  Ukraine, the new Crimean leader, whther he likes it or not, will  have to be cautious both in his actions and statements. "If the  Russian Federation leaders view the Crimean president as their  best ally in putting pressure on Ukraine and regard any Crimean  decisions as a guide for their own action, then one may have no  doubt that, following an aggravation of Russo-Ukrainian  relations, many Russian republics would develop a natural desire  to follow the Crimean example and make use of the advantageous  precedent in the interests of their own sovereignty".  IZVESTIYA on the same subject: "The election of Meshkov as  the president of the Crimea creates a fundamentally new  situation in Russo-Ukrainian relations". "Until now, calls for  the Crimea's secession from Ukraine and accession to Russia were  issued only during demonstrations and rallies by opposition  parties, which saved Moscow the trouble of officially reacting  to them. The picture has changed after January 30: a person who  does not conceal his pro-Russian sympathies and who is firmly  intent on holding a referendum on the Crimea's status soon came  to power in the Crimea. "Kiev resolutely opposes the idea: It  is not difficult to visualise the outcome of the polling. If  the new Crimean leader shows persistence, insisting on a  referendum, the situation on the peninsula may get sharply  aggravated, threatening to bring about serious complications in  Russo-Ukrainian relations as well".  TRUD on the election of Crimean president: Kiev, while  stating that it has nothing against the election of a president  in the Crimea, "at the same time hurried to adopt such  amendments to the Ukrainian Constitution, which enable the  president of the republic to call the Crimea to `order' if the  two republics' positions diverge".  PRAVDA quotes Meshkov as saying in an interview that "peace  and national accord are the most important thing for people in  the Crimea." "There will always be room for both Ukrainians,  Tatars and Russians in the Crimea -- for all those who are  prepared to work honestly here," Meshkov said.  SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA believes that following the election of  Yuriy Meshkov as the president "the Crimea has chosen its  destiny" by quite definitely declaring its will for the  establishment of closer contacts with Russia.  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI on prospects for the development of reforms  in the Russian Federation and an economic policy which the  country's reorganised government will pursue. The newspaper  believes that the new government "will have to look for some  different approaches" to the solution of economic issues. "This  is quite an urgent necessity but one gathers the impression that  the premier and his closet entourage fear 'anti-market' labels  so much that they do not reveal their plans so far," points out  the author of an analytical article on the subject. At the same  time he expresses an opinion that an adjustment to the policy  implies "enhancement of state economic regulation and limitation  on the freedom of operation of market mechanisms". Academician  Andrey Zhukov, member of the presidential council, is of the  opinion that there is no rollback in the reform process. At the  same time, he points out that "the tendencies that manifest  themselves now took shape long ago". "They were laid down by the  old government and in no way created a good climate for  entrepreneurial activities in Russia".  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) on the military service under  contract. According to the newspaper, more than 120,000 people  now serve under contract in Russia, which has helped to raise  the manning status of the Army and Navy by 10 per cent.  According to a recent presidential decree, there will be  another 150,000 professionals in the Army soon.  IZVESTIYA carries an interview with former Belarusian  parliament chief Stanislav Shushkevich. He remarked in  particular that "through the efforts of the Belarusian  Government, not a single market mechanism works in the republic  now".</p>

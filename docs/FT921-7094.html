			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Leading Article: Engineers and a welding job IN A COUNTRY preoccupied by recession, unemployment and trains which fail to run on time, the role and structure of the UK's professional engineering institutions may seem too timeless a subject to merit scrutiny. Not surprisingly, therefore, the progress of a steering group charged with considering a new focal point for the profession scores low on the Richter scale of news. But behind the group's work, launched in January and since welcomed by the government, lies a sad but undeniable paradox: UK professional engineers are highly regarded overseas for their skills, but at home they are Cinderellas in terms of pay and status. According to one recent survey, the UK comes fourth from bottom of the European league in net pay for both experienced and newly qualified engineers. Professional engineers pin some of the blame for this on City short-termism that elevates accountants, rather than engineers, to the top jobs in manufacturing industry. In the turbulent 1980s, financial engineering often took precedence over the electrical, mechanical or civil variety in many large public companies. But engineers must bear some of the blame themselves: as is implicitly recognised in the agreement of the Engineering Council (set up in 1981 by Sir Keith Joseph following the Finniston Inquiry into the profession) to a proposal which will probably lead to its own abolition. A personal initiative unveiled last November by Sir John Fairclough, the council's chairman, calls for it to be replaced by a new federal body to co-ordinate the engineers' 46 distinct institutions. These bodies in turn have approved the formation of a steering group to point the way ahead. Promote the status There are big issues at stake: how better to encourage young people into engineering, to stimulate the provision of relevant degree courses, to promote the status of the engineer within industry and society, and to set standards of professional conduct to raise the public's confidence in engineers and their work. To tackle any of these issues effectively, engineers need a body capable of speaking coherently and with authority. The Engineering Council, created by government but lacking the statutory authority that Finniston wanted, has made limited progress on some of the big issues but remains an unsatisfactory half-way house. Too specialised An unco-ordinated viewpoint on educational priorities, for example, explains partly why Britain has struggled so long and hard to produce degree courses to nurture the more broadly educated engineers employers say they want. One reason why so few engineers reach the boardroom is that too many of them are too specialised. There is no room in senior management for engineers who cannot communicate well and think laterally. The new scheme is a welcome first step towards solving the problem of institutional fragmentation. A federal structure that brings power to the centre only on key issues - education, training, codes of conduct and the environment - should be workable if the more specialist institutions and their members are given a say, but not the power to veto necessary change. That said, it must be admitted that the proposed new structure falls well short of the more unified professional system elsewhere in Europe. By avoiding shot-gun weddings among the institutions, the reformers should not duck the case for a season of arranged marriages. Even with determined institutional reform, it will be a long time before Britain's 290,000 registered engineers and technicians win the status they covet. But reducing structural confusion is a worthwhile start, and ought at least to help engineers to get their message across. Who knows, if ERM membership does eventually deliver for Britain a more stable manufacturing sector, the country's newly articulate and well-organised engineers might indeed be in a better position to climb the corporate greasy pole. That would be a desirable outcome from every point of view.</p>

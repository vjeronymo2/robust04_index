			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Air France chief quits as recovery plan is withdrawn: Government seeks to preserve 'social peace' MR Bernard Attali, chairman of Air France, resigned last night after the French government said it was withdrawing a controversial cost-cutting plan which triggered a week of strikes at the state-owned airline. The withdrawal of the plan reflects the government's fear of an escalation in the dispute and concern that it could prompt wider unrest in public sector industry. The strike, mainly involving ground staff protesting against the recovery plan, was due to be joined tomorrow by Air France pilots and cabin staff and by unions at Aeroports de Paris, the airport authority, and at Air Inter, the domestic airline controlled by Air France. The government's decision also raises questions about its ability to push through the restructuring of state-owned companies which are to be sold as part of its ambitious privatisation programme. Air France is one of 21 publicly owned groups due to be sold by the centre-right government of Mr Edouard Balladur. The government stressed a restructuring plan would still be implemented at Air France, which suffered losses of FFr3.8bn (Pounds 440m) in the first half of the year. But it said that amendments must be made to take account of union grievances. 'Because we must have social peace we must change the plan,' said Mr Bernard Bosson, the transport minister, said in a statement on French television. He said that the 4,000 job cuts involved in the original plan could be achieved without compulsory redundancies and that it was necessary to re-establish trust with the airline's employees. Mr Bosson gave himself three months to draw up a new recovery package for the ailing airline. Mr Attali's continued insistence that his plan was necessary for the survival of the airline made his position increasingly untenable. His position was further weakened by the fact that he was an appointee of the former socialist government, and his future had been in doubt ever since the centre-right won power at the last election. Mr Attali, the twin brother of Mr Jacques Attali, who recently resigned as head of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, said: 'The public authorities have decided to withdraw the programme to return to financial equilibrium that I consider indispensable.' The strike at Air France is the first serious industrial dispute faced by the French government since it took office in March. Yesterday's climbdown illustrates the dilemma it faces in its conflicting demands of restructuring inefficient state-owned companies, many of which it is seeking to privatise, while trying to avoid social unrest created by an unemployment rate at 11.7 per cent. A number of other public sector protests were planned before yesterday's announcements. In addition to the Air France strike, unions have called for a day of mass action on November 18 which is expected to hit France's railways, postal and telecommunications services. The threat of broader public-sector actions prompted the government to step in quickly at Air France. In weekend negotiations, Mr Bosson had already offered concessions to Air France's unions, including a proposal that pay cuts be limited to 1 per cent for the airline's lowest-paid workers and that reductions in overtime pay could also be revised. Unions representing Air France ground staff rejected the compromise, demanding that Mr Attali's plan be abandoned. It was unclear after last night's withdrawal, whether the unions would now call off the strike. The original plan, which included the sale of the group's hotel interests and cuts in overtime pay, was aimed at returning the airline to the black by the end of 1994. Attali departs, Page 3</p>

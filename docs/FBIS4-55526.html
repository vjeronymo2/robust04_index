			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] An international seminar on security issues in  Central and East Europe began in Prague today. Miroslav  Konvalina has been following its proceedings in the Atrium Hotel:    [Konvalina] The opening speeches and early discussions  indicate that deputies from East and West European countries,  politicians, journalists, and other participants in the seminar  are eager to get to know not only our positions on NATO and  other European institutions, but also the changing policy of  Russia, its self-confident actions on foreign and security  issues and, in this context, ways of facing a possible change of  Russian policy.    In the opening address at the seminar, Defense Minister  Antonin Baudys analyzed security risks in present-day Europe.  He said Russia is a volcano, whose lava of instability could  spill far beyond the borders.    Deputy Foreign Minister Pavel Bratinka noted that Russia has  also received an offer to join the Partnership for Peace program  and that, in the West, there is no country aspiring to threaten  Russia. That is why our efforts aimed at gaining NATO  membership are not motivated primarily by our fear of Russia,  but by our endeavor to embody the values we have in common with  West Europe in joint institutions.

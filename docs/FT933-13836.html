			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (18): At last the tide is turning for ex-wives - Two legal cases and a government study group offer new hope for women who face retirement in the wake of a broken marriage / Divorce THE PENSIONS industry, assisted by the legal profession, has come to grips with what too many divorcees realise only too late: that a pension, too, is an asset accumulated during a marriage, and that both parties have a claim on it. Unfortunately, many wives have found themselves past retirement age with nothing but minimum state benefits and whatever wealth they were able to garner from a broken marriage. There is general agreement that the status quo has been radically unfair to many homemakers who had relied on their husband's income for support, and counted on it into retirement. But because of the ambiguities of the law - and perhaps through failure to recognise a pension for what it really is - divorce lawyers have rarely sought to divide pension entitlements when a marriage has come to an end. Hence the shock-waves earlier this year from a case brought by the widow of the former Tory MP, Sir Eldon Griffiths, who was left to face old age with maintenance of just 5p a year. She successfully sued her lawyers for failing to ensure that her husband's pension entitlement, built up over a 30-year marriage, was divided between them. The Court agreed with Mrs Griffiths, and awarded her a one-off Pounds 21,802 payment. Another sign that the legal tide is turning in favour of ex-wives was contained in a ruling a few weeks later, in a case identified only as B v B. In this case, Mr Justice Ewbank, in the High Court, upheld a decision by a district judge to alter the terms of a husband's pension, to give his former wife an immediate annuity and a pension. The case involved a 60-year-old man, who was entitled to receive his pension, and his 50-year-old wife. The man held a 52 per cent stake in the company he worked for, and pensions lawyers said the ruling had particular implications for self-administered schemes in small companies, which may now have to pay out annuities and pensions to wives when employees become divorced. But even if neither B v B nor Mrs Griffiths' settlement prompts a sea-change in legal opinion, a landmark document on the subject certainly will. In May, the Pensions Management Institute and the Law Society, after 15 months of laborious deliberation, produced a paper suggesting legal changes which would confirm that pension entitlement accumulated during a marriage is indeed jointly owned, just like any other long-term savings or investment. They suggest four possible ways of dividing pension entitlement which, among other things, would allow pension fund trustees, for the first time, to direct payments to someone other than the scheme member. The division of pension rights after a divorce is also one of 81 questions under consideration by a government advisory panel on pension reform, chaired by Professor Roy Goode. Pensions lawyers expect the PMI/Law Society recommendations to be incorporated into the Goode Committee's final recommendations. The report of the PMI and the Law Society offers four possible scenarios for the division of pension rights following divorce. The advantages of each would depend on the circumstances of the divorcing couple: Pension rights might continue undisturbed, but their value be taken into account. Any reallocation of resources between the couple would be made by adjustment of non-pension assets. Pension rights might be 'earmarked', so that they continue undisturbed during the working spouse's employment, but, once the payment date becomes effective, a portion of the benefit would be automatically directed to the other spouse. Pension benefits might be split within a scheme, so that the scheme member's rights are reduced by a specified amount and resources from the scheme released to provide, within the scheme, a package of benefit rights for the former spouse, as though she or he had been a full scheme member as well. Through the use of pension transfers, a scheme member's pension rights might be reduced, and the difference used to provide a transfer value to be shifted to an alternative scheme on behalf of the former spouse. The study group recommends the last method as the most attractive, because it leaves room for a clean-break divorce settlement and imposes relatively little administrative expense on pension schemes. The first method is currently in use in Scotland, where the courts have already come to grips with the concept that pension entitlement accrued during a marriage is a jointly-held asset. However, there are difficulties associated with reliance on this method alone. The solution is only workable where there are sufficient assets other than pension entitlement. In cases where there are substantial jointly held savings or investments, for instance, a husband may surrender a portion of the investment which he is entitled to, in lieu of a wife's agreement to forego pension benefits of equivalent value. But when other assets are not available - or where they may be illiquid, such as a family home in which an ex-wife and dependent children are living  -this form of pension settlement is less satisfactory. Of all the pension issues facing the lawmakers, the division of pensions upon divorce is hardly the thorniest nor the most commercially sensitive. Yet it is among the areas of greatest concern to one of society's most vulnerable groups, elderly women.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [EL ESPECTADOR editorial: "Traumas of the `Apertura' </F> Program"]    [Text] In our editorials, with some reservations in cases  of disagreement, we have noted Colombia's gains to date through  the "apertura" [economic liberalization program] and its  execution. That is fair and appropriate for an objective  analysis of the facts, since without an effective application of  the model--so different from what we had before--Colombia could  not have overcome the economic challenges that have emerged  because of a transformation imposed not only by official  government policies, but also by market dynamics. Events in the  last decade have created a 360-degree change in the course of  the entire world, forcing old powers to accede to a new  international reality.    Even so, the nation, not just the government, failed to  anticipate many factors that should have been considered  earlier. Apart from the hasty implementation of an "apertura"  that should have been gradual (as the former minister of  development and now presidential candidate Ernesto Samper  proposed), other factors creating maladjustments have come into  play, sometimes as a consequence of the government's action, and  at other times as a corollary of the business strategy designed  to suffer as little as possible from the traumas of the change  in economic model. So the "apertura" has produced different  reactions in each economic sector, even in the same sector,  depending on the subsectors' level of development.    If our memory is correct, on various occasions we strongly  suggested that greater administrative efficiency was needed in  government agencies handling imports, exports, and foreign trade  in general. Without that efficiency--let there be no mistake  about this--the goals pursued would be weakened by failures and  omissions that would impair both competitiveness and the  economic policy itself. We knew, of course, that the ideal of an  efficient Colombia is a remote aspiration, but even so, the  obvious successes of a transition to which almost all the  countries of the world have committed themselves show that  improvements are possible in a process that entails a period of  experiments and learning.    To take one example, the situation in the import sector at  the start of a year that was expected to be active is hard to  comprehend. The possibility that the arrival and acceptance of  imported goods might be impeded because there are no forms for  the required procedures did not occur to anyone. The standards  for the new valuation code were approved three months ago,  sufficient time to prepare such an essential instrument. All of  us, both those involved in this sector and those who are simply  onlookers, were surprised by the government's failure to take a  basic but valuable step to protect both importers and the state.    No less damaging for the "apertura" and the current  privatizations policy is the situation concerning the transfer  of ports to the private companies that will manage and operate  them, especially as it has arisen just a few hours before the  disappearance of Colpuertos [Colombian Port Enterprise] from the  national administrative map. These are two strikes against the  external sector that will definitely hurt both its structure and  the pace of its normal operations. A few more requirements  placed upon the public officials responsible for satisfying such  urgent needs, even severe penalties if warranted, would be no  bad thing if we truly want to become internationalized along  with our partners and competitors in a complex market.    We are offering the preceding comments because a government  nearing the end of its term in office is obliged to preserve the  prestige of the policy it has adopted, and to exercise the  controls required so that procedural matters will not dissipate  the vigor of that policy. Furthermore, we believe the  presidential candidates should pay attention to what is  happening, so that whoever wins the election will be well aware  of the problems he may face in an area that is crucial for the  economy and for the stability of the nation in general. We hope  these maladjustments will be reviewed and suitable correctives  applied.</p>

			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / Bonn dispels prospect of G7 support for US dollar The German government moved yesterday to dispel expectations that the summit of the world's seven leading industrial countries this weekend would try to strengthen the weak dollar. Although financial markets were generally quiet, a tightly compressed week of policymaking meetings - today's session of US Federal Open Market Committee, the policymaking body of the Federal Reserve; a Bundesbank council meeting on Thursday; and the G7 summit in Naples beginning the next day - has intensified speculation that some effort may be made to support the US currency. The dollar finished in London at Y98.9 and DM1.5965, barely changed from Friday's close of Y98.705 and DM1.5946. US financial markets were closed for the July 4 holiday. Last week the dollar fell against the yen to a post-1945 low of Y97.68 and concerns about the US currency contributed to general financial market volatility. But the most senior German official involved in the preparation for the G7 summit in Naples said yesterday he did not understand 'the recent excitement about the dollar, especially in relation to the European currencies'. Mr Gert Haller, state secretary in the finance ministry and Chancellor Helmut Kohl's personal 'sherpa' for G7, said: 'The developments of recent weeks have fortunately had no significant effect on European exchange rates. I cannot see any reason for excitement in that.' At about DM1.60, the dollar/ D-Mark exchange rate fitted its long-term average rate, he added. Mr Haller said a special difficulty existed in the yen-dollar exchange rate, stemming directly from the 'difficult relations' between the US and Japan over trade. Analysts in London said the FOMC faced a dilemma today in that a rise in US interest rates was likely to push US and European markets lower and might be seen as a precursor for more concerted action at the G7 meeting. Yet keeping rates at their present levels could cause a further bout of dollar-selling. Despite Mr Haller's apparent lack of concern at the dollar's weakness, the state secretary said trends in the long-term capital markets, particularly rising US interest rates, were indeed a worry for Germany. He said that did not reflect the progress made by the German government in bringing its deficit spending under control, nor the steady decrease in the German inflation rate, most recently to under 3 per cent. 'If you look at the short-term interest rates today, I believe there is room for further reductions in long-term rates,' he said. Mr Haller said he expected the general improvement in the world economy, combined with concern at the continuing high level of unemployment, to dominate the G7 economic agenda. Germany will also be pushing at the summit for a firm commitment to more financial assistance to help with nuclear safety in the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe, including cash to help Ukraine close down all the reactors at the stricken Chernobyl plant. Mr Kohl was concerned that closure of Chernobyl should be seen as a step towards dealing with all the other unsafe nuclear reactors in central and eastern Europe.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of statement issued by members of the Yemeni </F> Socialist Party Central Committee; place and date not given]    [Text] Several leaders of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP]  Central Committee have issued a statement condemning the  declaration of secession made by traitor al-Bid and stressing  that this declaration is a retreat from our people's greatest  and most important options of unity, democracy, and party and  political pluralism. Following is the text of the statement:    We, along with our people, were surprised by the declaration  of secession made by the secessionist elements in the YSP  leadership. We, along with our people, realize that the YSP's  elements, cadres, and many of its leaders reject, absolutely and  in principle, this declaration, which does not express our  party's spirit, principles, and lengthy struggle designed to  effect both the September and October Yemeni revolutions and the  Yemeni unity on great 22 May 1990.    The declaration of secession is a retreat from our people's  greatest and most important options of unity, democracy, and  party and political pluralism. We, as leading elements in the  YSP and its Central Committee, condemn the declaration of  secession. We also believe that abidance by the constitution  and a return to dialogue are the only possible means to end the  impasse facing our people as a result of the declaration of  secession.    As leading elements in the YSP, we will hold further  consultations with our party colleagues in order to take a final  and decisive position on our relationship with the YSP.    This statement was signed by brothers 'Abd-al-Bari Tahir,  'Abdallah Hamid al-'Ulufi, and 'Abdallah Baydar, members of the  YSP Central Committee.</p>

			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Carsberg ordered to limit bus probe SIR Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, has been ordered by the High Court to vary the terms of a reference to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission after the first successful legal challenge to a decision by the UK competition authorities. The Office of Fair Trading said yesterday it had no plans to appeal against a judgment by Mr Justice Auld on Monday in proceedings brought by Southdown Motor Services, a south coast bus company. The MMC reference followed an OFT investigation last summer that found evidence of uneconomic pricing by Southdown on two routes in Bognor Regis, designed to drive a rival operator out of the market. The company challenged the reference on the ground that Sir Bryan unlawfully extended the scope of the inquiry by asking the commission to investigate all local bus services in the Bognor Regis area. The judge said that once the terms of an investigation under the 1980 Competition Act had been set by reference to a specific geographic area, it was not open to the director-general to widen the scope of the investigation when making a reference to the MMC. The reference to the MMC should be restricted to the investigation of uneconomic pricing on the two routes originally investigated by the OFT, he said.</p>

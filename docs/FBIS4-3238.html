			<p>BFN     [Text] Provincial party committee Secretary Yan Haiwang  yesterday joined the Lanzhou City delegation and the Ningxia Hui  Autonomous Prefecture delegation in discussing pressing issues  concerning the broad masses of people as well as ways and means  of properly handling relations between reform, development, and  stability.    After listening to speeches made by Guo Xianzhang, Tang  Shenjun, and other Lanzhou delegates, Secretary Yan Haiwang  said: Lanzhou is at once the only hinterland city of Gansu that  is open to the outside world and is the capital of Gansu  Province. Lanzhou's development has undoubtedly had an  important bearing on the province's overall development. Thus,  Lanzhou should make every possible endeavor to tap latent  potential, develop local superiority, deepen reforms, further  economic exploitation, and step up infrastructure construction,  especially infrastructure facilities concerning the livelihood  of the broad masses of the people, guarantee sufficient  vegetables and grain supply on the market, and properly tackle  other pressing issues as well.    After listening to speeches made by the Ningxia Hui  Autonomous Prefecture delegates, Secretary Yan Haiwang stated:  Ningxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture should strive to develop  local commercial and circulation superiority, press ahead with  economic growth in every way, and successfully build projects to  assist poverty-stricken areas. Economic development and  nationality solidarity are two crucial issues concerning the  development of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture, which  should make redoubled efforts to enhance nationality solidarity,  develop educational undertakings, and push ahead with economic  growth.    Finally, Secretary Yan Haiwang emphatically called on the  whole province to unit as one, work hard, brace up, make  down-to-earth efforts, and push Gansu's economic growth to a new  stage.</p>

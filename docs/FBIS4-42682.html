			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Klaus Kinkel, German foreign minister and </F> chairman of the Free Democratic Party of Germany, FDP, by  unidentified DER STANDARD correspondent; place and date not  given: "Kinkel -- Uncomfortable With Haider's Appearances"]    [Text] [DER STANDARD] In your speech at the [FDP] party  conference you mentioned the policies of Manfred Brunner, a  former FDP member and now chairman of the Alliance of Free  Citizens, and Joerg Haider, chairman of the Freedom Party of  Austria. You criticized them both and said they represent "a  different policy." Yet, only a short while ago, Haider was a  guest of honor at FDP events.    [Kinkel] Haider was indeed invited to several events by  subdivisions of the FDP. I did not feel comfortable with that,  but we are a liberal, tolerant party. Mr. Haider supports  policies that are incompatible with our ideas of liberalism.    [DER STANDARD] Does this mean that Haider will not be  invited  to any FDP events in the future?    [Kinkel] I think it would be very unwise for FDP  subdivisions  to invite Haider, who is actively campaigning for the  anti-Europe Brunner. But there is no imperative mandate in our  party.    [DER STANDARD] Mr. Kinkel, why did you, in your capacity as  foreign minister, support Austria so strongly during the  European Union [EU] membership negotiations?    [Kinkel] Because I am convinced that Austria and the other  EFTA [European Free Trade Association] countries need to be in  the EU. They will be an asset in economic, political, and  cultural terms. This goes especially for Austria. It would be  rather strange, if the German Foreign Minister did not speak up  for Austria in particular.    [DER STANDARD] The referendum on EU membership is pratically  upon us. Do you expect a positive outcome?    [Kinkel] I do not want to interfere in Austria's internal  affairs. But I cannot imagine the Austrians taking a negative  decision in the referendum.</p>

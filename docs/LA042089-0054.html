			<p><P> April 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> ERIC MARIENTHAL QUINTET ATTACKS SET WITH FERVOR  </P> <P> Squeezing the music of Eric Marienthal's high energy ensemble into the intimate  confines of Le Cafe's upstairs jazz room in Sherman Oaks is a bit like trying  to contain a windstorm in a pup tent.  </P> <P> Fortunately, the saxophonist's first set Monday night managed, for the most  part, to keep the musical quality as high as the decibel power. Performing  pieces that were drawn from his newly released GRP album, Marienthal -- perhaps  best known for his work with Chick Corea's Elektric Band -- sounded like a  player who is on the verge of discovering his own musical personality.  </P> <P> Two or three tunes into the set, Marienthal moved past the David Sanborn riffs  that are the starting points of his style and progressed into several  high-flying solos that were his, and his alone. "Reunion," co-composed with  bassist John Patitucci, triggered an improvisational tour through the harmonic  outer limits; on "Lee Ann," written for his wife, Marienthal abruptly shifted  gears, revealing a warmth and subtlety not always present in his up-tempo  playing.  </P> <P> There were, however, a few problems. Marienthal's band -- Patitucci on bass,  Pat Kelly on guitar, Mitchell Forman on keyboards, John Ferraro on drums -- was  not, except for Patitucci, present for the recording. They were obliged, as a  result, to place a bit too much focus on reading charts rather than exploring  the music.  </P> <P> In general, however, the band matched Marienthal's fervor, with Patitucci, in  particular, acting as a virtual musical partner, and Forman contributing  several vigorously creative solos.DON HECKMAN  </P></p>

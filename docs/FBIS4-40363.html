			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Colonel General Vyacheslav Trubnikov, first </F> deputy director of the Foreign Intelligence Service, by  KRIM-TASS correspondent Olga Semenova specially for ROSSIYSKAYA  GAZETA; place, date not given: "Our Agents Are Serving and Will  Continue To Do So!"]    [Text] [Semenova] The date 12 June was a holiday --  Russia's Independence Day. At the same time it marks the  adoption of the declaration of Russia's state sovereignty.  Needless to say, one of the components of any state's  sovereignty is national security in which the Russian  intelligence service is involved alongside other special  services and the Army. Can I ask you to flesh out the  contribution made by the Foreign Intelligence Service [FIS] to  ensuring that the new Russia really is a sovereign state?    [Trubnikov] Sovereignty is primarily security, protection of  national interests, and an independent and active foreign  policy. The intelligence service's role in all this is extremely  important, despite not always being evident -- such is the  nature of intelligence activity. The present transition period  in international relations has been marked by rapid changes in  all spheres of life. This affects Russia in particular. On the  whole, the trend of world development is favorable to our  country, but the range of threats remains extremely wide.  Monitoring and assessing these threats is a central and key  task of intelligence. At the present time Russia's interests,  and primarily its security, are threatened by the appearance of  "trouble spots" close to its borders. For the first time since  World War II attempts are being made to revise borders on the  European continent. The significance of economic and  environmental security has increased.    Needless to say, some of these problems have predominantly  domestic roots. However, we can also see external factors which  exacerbate these problems. The task of intelligence is to  uncover these factors. On a day-to-day basis Russian  intelligence agents supply information for subsequent  decisionmaking by the highest organs of power. Primarily  regarding issues of foreign and defense policy. In addition,  the intelligence service's remit includes the country's economic  security, scientific and technical progress, and the  environment. At home and abroad analytical reports by the FIS  have been an authoritative voice on major problems affecting  international security: On the proliferation of weapons of mass  destruction and NATO plans. We intend to continue the practice  of preparing these documents.    Finally, the intelligence service not only obtains  information; it also exchanges data with other special services  on problems of mutual interest. These include information on  the fight against terrorism, organized crime, and maintenance of  the nonproliferation regime applying to nuclear and other types  of weapons of mass destruction.    The need for the Russian FIS and its contribution to the  cause of protecting Russia's national security was underlined by  Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin when he visited FIS  headquarters recently. His speech to intelligence operatives  laid down future guidelines for all of us.    [Semenova] Incidentally, since you touched on the issue of  weapons of mass destruction. Russian and foreign mass media  have recently carried sensational reports regarding the problem  of the development of nuclear weapons in our country. In this  sphere, it seems, all the "laurels" belong to the intelligence  service, and our scientists merely give enthusiastic assessments  of the information obtained by intelligence.    [Trubnikov] This is nothing more than deliberate or not so  deliberate repetition of old cock-and-bull stories about the  Russians "stealing" the atomic bomb from the Americans. It was  untrue 50 years ago and it remains untrue today.    In fact, the development of nuclear weapons in our country  has been the result primarily of our own scientific efforts and  our own scientific leading lights such as Kurchatov, Khariton,  Zeldovich, and many others. The atom bomb is not some simple  mechanism which it is possible to look over and then copy back  at home. If our own scientists had not been able to fully grasp  the secrets of the atomic nucleus, they would simply have been  unable to understand and assess the information on nuclear  problems which our intelligence service managed to obtain.    Today this is history, and there are frequently  exaggerations  in the way history is told: Sometimes silence is assiduously  cultivated, whereas at other times, on the contrary, too much  emphasis is placed. The intelligence service does not want  "other people's laurels," as you put it. It is entirely  satisfied with its own. And the service which intelligence  provided in this case was to latch onto an important trend in  the development of science and technology, a trend which had  colossal military potential, and to obtain information which  enabled us to speed up -- let me repeat, speed up -- work on  developing nuclear weapons in our country.    [Semenova] Thank you, I think your explanation dots all the  i's and crosses all the t's, at the same time precisely  indicating the intelligence service's role in developing  science. This is especially topical at the moment.    But in the former USSR Russia did not have its own security  organs, including an intelligence service. Following the Soviet  Union's disintegration how was the FIS formed -- on the  "wreckage" of the USSR KGB First Main Directorate or, so to  speak, from scratch?    [Trubnikov] The FIS was not formed on "wreckage" or from  scratch. Russia received a strong existing intelligence  service: the First Main Directorate's material and technical and  organizational base and its cadres.    Furthermore, by that time Russia had already started to form  its own security organs system. In March 1991 the Federal  Security Agency was set up, which included counterintelligence  and intelligence subdivisions. Many KGB and First Main  Directorate staffers were sent to work in the Russian state  security organs, and many of them now occupy leading posts in  the FIS. At the end of 1991 the First Main Directorate and  Russian intelligence subdivisions merged.    [Semenova] How does the FIS differ from the First Main  Directorate in terms of its structure and from other  intelligence services in terms of its tasks?... Or are the  general organizational principles the same for all the world's  intelligence services, like the laws of society's development?    [Trubnikov] The main difference is that the intelligence  service has stopped being the quasi-state and quasi-party organ  it was within the KGB framework. Hence all the changes:  departyization, deideologization, organizational and functional  autonomy, strict observance of the law, control from the  legislative and executive branches, and such like.    Of course, the ending of the Cold War and the emergence of  new geopolitical realities set us new tasks. Certain new  subdivisions were formed to tackle them: economic intelligence,  monitoring the nonproliferation of mass destruction weapons,  collaboration with foreign special services. On the whole our  intelligence service has a structure which is typical of all  modern special services. It is determined by the very nature of  intelligence and by the nature of its activity, and includes the  extractive apparatus, analytical subdivisions, and auxiliary  services.    [Semenova] What position does Russian intelligence occupy in  the world "league table" of special services?    [Trubnikov] When we start talking about which intelligence  services are in the premier world league and what positions they  occupy in it, then the leaders most frequently mentioned are the  U.S. CIA, the Israeli Mossad, the British secret service, and  Russian intelligence. We have always been in this league and I  would like to believe that we will always remain in it.    As regards the specific position, much depends on the  parameters used to define it: the scale of activity, the size  of the budget, the number of personnel, the professional  standard of intelligence officers, their commitment to their  duty, and how they turn their qualities into specific results.    Our people daily prove their loyalty to Russia in their  deeds. I believe that, if the cadre personnel of our  "opponents" were put into the same conditions in which Russian  intelligence now finds itself, few would survive. But ours  serve and will continue to serve!    [Semenova] Initially "civilian" leaders, mainly politicians,  have also been appointed in other special services. But later  they all received military ranks and already feel like real  "military men." The FIS director is a politician and  academician but has not become a general. Why?    [Trubnikov] The FIS director's authority is determined not  by the number and size of stars on his shoulder boards or the  lack of same. The main thing here is knowledge, analytical and  organizational abilities, a commitment to the cause, and  attention to people's needs. Yevgeniy Maksimovich Primakov has  all this, and without a military rank.    [Semenova] Are there other academicians in the FIS?    [Trubnikov] So far none of the FIS cadre staffers has  received this academic rank.    [Semenova] What currently attracts people to an intelligence  officer's profession?    [Trubnikov] Not ultrahigh wages at any rate. Our staffers'  salaries are not the lowest but, like those of all budget-funded  employees and servicemen, are considerably lower than in the  private sector. But roughly the same situation exists in other  countries.    Young people are now coming into intelligence above all  because this work gives them the opportunity to serve their  country and to bring it benefit at our difficult time. An  intelligence officer's profession allows a person to show  himself as an individual, to realize his working, volitional,  and moral qualities -- sometimes in extreme situations -- and to  become a top-class expert. Our specialists in the fields of  politics, economics, military matters, and science and  technology are constantly abreast of the latest world events and  achievements in the spheres of their activity.    People now want to come into intelligence not because it is  "advantageous" but because it is important and interesting.    [Semenova] Spy -- is that offensive? Has the attitude  toward intelligence changed, do people not continue to confuse  it with a political police?    [Trubnikov] We are dealing with cadre intelligence officers  or agents. It is our Federal Counterintelligence Service which  mainly deals with spies, because a spy is considered to be  someone who works against our country, whereas we work for  Russia.    We do not engage in political investigation. In my opinion  this is clear to an unbiased compatriot.    [Semenova] If you started all over again would you become an  intelligence officer?    [Trubnikov] Of course!</p>

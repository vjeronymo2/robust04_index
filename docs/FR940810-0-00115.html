			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> (8) Respiratory Protection <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> Paragraph (g) General Industry <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The 1986 general industry standard required respirator use where engineering and work practice controls are being installed, in emergencies, and to reduce exposures to or below the PELs where feasible engineering controls and work practices could not achieve these reductions. Additionally, certain operations i.e., cutting in plants, were shown to have greater difficulties in achieving low exposures without respirator use. OSHA therefore allowed routine respirator use in those segments to reach the PELS, rather than, as in other general industry segments, only where the employer shows that feasible engineering and work practice controls cannot achieve compliance with the PELs. OSHA now believes that engineering and work practices in the few remaining production sectors can achieve lower levels than predicted in 1986, in part because of the mandatory work practices now included in the methods of compliance section. Therefore, allowing respirator use at higher measured exposures for a few operations should not result in less protection for those employees since their ambient exposure levels are expected to be reduced.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (h) Construction Standard and Shipyard Employment Standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The respirator provisions in the construction and shipyard employment standards are changed in several respects. First, in addition to the conditions listed in the 1986 standards, where exposures exceed the PELs, required respirator use now is triggered by kinds of activities even where the PELs are not exceeded. These are: Class I work, Class II work where the ACM is not removed substantially intact; all Class II and III work where the employer cannot produce a negative exposure assessment; and all Class IV work carried out in areas where respirators are required to be worn. OSHA has based these decisions on the demonstrated variability during asbestos work, and on the need to protect workers who are disturbing asbestos-containing material with the greatest potential for significant fiber release. In addition, monitoring results for many jobs are not available in a timely fashion. By requiring routine respirator use in jobs which OSHA finds are likely to result in hazardous airborne asbestos levels, such as floor tile removal, where most tiles are broken, OSHA is providing reasonable supplemental protection to employees when certainty concerning exposure levels is not possible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The kind of respirators required for these ``conditions of use'' are set out in paragraphs (h)(iv) and (v). In one situation, as explained below, Class I removals where excessive levels are predicted, ``supplied air respirators operated in the positive pressure mode'' are required, because these jobs have the highest exposure potential, due to their size, duration and the kinds of material involved. Other jobs where higher than usual exposures may occur include, where employees are inexperienced, where TSI and surfacing ACM is disturbed, and where other ACM is broken up during removal. Paragraph (h)(1) states the requirement for supplemental respirator use for these activities as well. These additional respirator requirements conform to OSHA's findings on this record, of the specific conditions which contribute to and are predictive of, higher exposures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed more fully in the classification section, the data submitted to the record show that in almost all cases of removals and disturbances of non-high-risk ACM, exposure levels are well below the protection factor limits for negative-pressure half-mask respirators, the type required for certain kinds of Class II and III work.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> BCTD has recommended that OSHA require the use of ``the most effective respirator that is feasible under the circumstances'' and further that OSHA require ``supplied air respirators which are tight fitting and in a pressure demand mode with either auxiliary SCBA or a HEPA egress cartridge *&blank;*&blank;* except in limited circumstances which include lack of feasibility because of the configuration of the work environment or an uncorrectable safety hazard'' (Ex. 143 at 65&hyph;69). BCTD does recognize safety hazards due to the tripping hazard of air lines to which SARs are attached and define certain activities in which PAPRs may be used instead. (Ex. 143 at 71). BCTD also contended that the protection factors used by OSHA to assign respirator classes are contrary to record evidence.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Court found that OSHA's judgment about supplied air respirators was properly within its discretion. It expressed concern that OSHA's respirator requirements did appear to require only that the combined effect of engineering and work practice controls and respirators limit exposure only as low as the PEL where significant risk remained (838 F.2d at 1274).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

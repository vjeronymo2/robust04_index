			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Ivan Novikov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 24 June -- Anatoliy Chubays has reacted very  quickly to deputies' demands in the State Duma today to create a  solid legal basis for the privatization process. The chairman  of the state committee for the management of state property sent  a telegram which was circulated as quickly among the deputies  during the plenary session.    "Taking into consideration the wishes of the deputies and on  the basis of the presidential resolution of 10 June 1994, I  think it would be expedient for the government to submit for the  State Duma's consideration the bill "On the state program of  privatization of state and municipal enterprises," Anatoliy  Chubays wrote. He told the parliamentarians that the state  committee for the management of state property had already  prepared such a bill and it could be submitted to the State Duma  immediately after Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin's return  from his foreign business trip on 25 June.</p>

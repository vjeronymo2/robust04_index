			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar below intervention level THE DOLLAR drifted down towards its previous close of DM1.4640 against the D-Mark in European trading yesterday, underlining the impression that the Federal Reserve's intervention on behalf of the US currency last Friday was a failure, writes James Blitz. In late US trading on Friday, the Fed intervened in the market five times, buying dollars between the DM1.4675 and DM1.4730 levels. But the US currency yesterday traded in a tight range that was below the intervention level, between DM1.4655 and 1.4705. In Europe, it closed up against the D-Mark at DM1.4670 compared to a previous close of DM1.4645. Dealers are worried by the prospect of further intervention and are wary of pushing the dollar back to DM1.46. But Friday's Fed intervention has also been deemed a failure. According to Mr Avinash Persaud, a currency economist at UBS Phillips and Drew in London, the Fed should have stayed its hand until tomorrow, in the hope that the Bundesbank will add liquidity to the German money market. A softening of short term rates in Germany, which are hovering around the Lombard rate level of 9.75 per cent, would help the dollar to rally this week. Otherwise, dealers continue to be impressed by the rate of return on the D-Mark. Yesterday, the D-Mark/yen cross was the most lucrative trade, after the Nikkei Index in Tokyo fell temporarily below the 15,000 figure. The drop in Japanese equities has revived fears of a cut in the Bank of Japan's Official Discount Rate, widening the interset rate differential with the D-Mark. The yen closed at Y87.27, from a previous finish of Y86.21. Sterling closed the day a  1/4 pfennig up against the D-Mark at DM2.8275. But its underlying tone remains weak. The pound is more firmly entrenched than ever at the bottom of the European Monetary System grid, with a 3.15 percentage point differential separating it from the Italian lira, the next weakest currency. The Italian lira was again softer against the D-Mark, closing at L756.6 from a previous close of L756.0. This new slippage has led some to believe that the Bank of Italy was too hasty when it cut its discount rate last week by 0.5 percentage points. But the Bank dealt again at a 'repo' rate of 14.21 per cent in its money market operations, in what may have been an attempt to stall the trend in falling rates. Norway's Central Bank said it had not bought Norwegian crowns in the spot market, after agency reports that it was trying to support its weakening currency. Instead, the Bank said that it was carrying out ordinary swap transactions to withdraw liquidity from the market and help lift short-term interest rates.</p>

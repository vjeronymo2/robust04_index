			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "The United States--Repetition of </F> Its Errors"]    [Text] In view of its military defeat in Somalia, the U.S.  forces are in the process of withdrawing from that country and  as a reaction to this defeat, Secretary of Defense Les Aspin has  resigned. This is a clear indication of the impotence and  decrepitude of the U.S. foreign policy as regards international  affairs in the post Cold War era. THE WASHINGTON TIMES  newspaper carried an analytical article with repetitive remarks  regarding Iran which is evidence of the blind hostility and  animosity of the U.S. echelons with regard to Iran. It appears  that the U.S. analysts are seeking to compensate for the utter  humiliation that they had to endure in their current defeat by  initiating another psychological war!    The analyst of the aforementioned newspaper has cited a  Pentagon source stating: "The U.S. planning for a possible  clash with Iran began quite a while ago and war with Iran is  inevitable, as Iran is considered a potential enemy of the  United States; Washington takes Iran's strength very  seriously." The Pentagon official has not specified the time  frame for this war, but has stated: "The Pentagon echelons are  assuming that there will be a juncture when Iran will take some  action that will necessitate a reaction on the part of the  United States."    In attempting to justify these allegations by the Pentagon  officials, the newspaper analyst mentioned various instances  that could prove to be possible pretexts for the United States  to embroil itself in a conflict with Iran, such as an attempt  against a CIA official's life, Iran's uncompromising attitude  toward the Zionist regime's compromise [with the PLO] and has  stressed: "Apparently, the United States is the only country in  the world that takes the threat of Iran seriously." According  to THE WASHINGTON TIMES, this U.S. Department of Defense  official claimed: "In the past two years, Iran has purchased  weapons worth billions of dollars and, apart from the U.S.  military presence in the Persian Gulf, Iran is the strongest  country in the region today." This official has expressed his  concern over the mounting spiritual clout of Iran among the  Muslim countries of Africa and Asia, and even in Europe,  stating: "The religious decree against Salman Rushdie is so  harsh that it forced the U.S. President to apologize to the  Muslims for the few minutes of his meeting with Rushdie in the  White House."    As to the fact that plans for a possible U.S. clash with  Iran  began quite a while ago, there is not the slightest doubt. One  can say that these plans began on the morning of the victory of  the Islamic Revolution and since the inception of the Islamic  movement, in fact. In the course of the last years, U.S.  officials have always considered war with Iran imminent and have  even experimented with it in instances such as the "Tabas  incident." [attempt to liberate the U.S. hostages]    Thus, the mention of such allegations is not new for  Iranians, as Iran's stance on a confrontation with the United  States is too clear to require any such pretexts. Therefore,  what purpose does the repetition of such remarks serve,  especially claims such as "Iran purchased billions of dollars  worth of weapons..." and so on? It appears that the U.S. has  had failures one after the other in trying to forge its "new  world order." The resulting vacuum in the bipolar world has  motivated the residual elements of the Cold War in the United  States to try to compensate for their failures and to fill the  existing vacuum by carving out a new pole. It is for this  purpose that they are after Iran, as they have admitted  themselves that "Iran's spiritual clout among the Muslim  countries of Africa, Asia, even of Europe is a source of  concern."    Even though Iran has sought to forge new relations with the  West and to mitigate the existing tension, such propaganda  fanned by the U.S. media indicates that the Westerners--the  Americans in particular--are not willing to learn a lesson from  the past or to comprehend the changes that have emerged in Iran  and the world. They still think that by indulging in  belligerence and propagandistic blackmail, they can pursue their  illicit interests. Such experiments have lost their novelty for  Iranians and only strengthen their determination on the path to  a confrontation with the Americans. When the hungry Somalis can  send the bodies of American soldiers home, the more  war-experienced people of Iran are well aware of their  obligations.    Today, more than ever before, the remarks of the imam become  clear to intelligent people: "The United States cannot do  anything wrong to Iran." The U.S. officials and analysts are  requested to attend to their insolvent economy instead of  voicing such claims and allegations in the media and they should  challenge their Asian and European rivals instead. Of course,  in order to succeed in this battle, the United States should  reappraise its relations with Third World countries. Third  World countries in general now tend to lean toward Japan and  Europe, which can only expedite the U.S. defeat on the  international level. It would be well worth their while for the  U.S. officials to think of peace rather than warmongering and  not to dissipate their resources in wars in Iraq, Somalia, and  so on.    The wise learn from their mistakes and do not repeat them.  If the U.S. officials insist on repeating their errors, the  Iranian people are ready to teach them a lesson that they will  never forget.</p>

			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Top committee tackles Thai motorway row THE THAI government has formed a high-level committee, headed by deputy prime minister Amnuay Viranvan, to try to settle a dispute over the contract terms of an almost completed Dollars 1bn (Pounds 640m) elevated motorway. The second stage of a toll road running through Bangkok remains closed despite government demands that it open immediately because of 'a national crisis' in the city's traffic system. Bangkok Expressway, the consortium building the road, says it will open the road toll free for 90 days if the government agrees to settle its dispute within that time. It insists it will terminate the contract if there is no agreement by then. The state-owned Expressway and Rapid Transit Authority responsible for the project has now effectively been cut out of negotiations and its governor has offered to resign. Bangkok Expressway, led by the Japanese company Kumagai Gumi, has complained that the government has reneged on contract terms by cutting the toll by a third, not allowing the consortium to operate the road for the agreed 30 years, and disputing revenue sharing arrangements. Last week Mr Tarrin Nimmanhaiminda, minister of finance, assured representatives of 31 international and 11 Thai banks that they 'won't suffer'. But a banker said it was worrying that even at this late stage the government had not addressed complaints head on. The lenders, which have committed the equivalent of Bt20bn (Pounds 517m), suspended loan disbursements to BECL in March. Meanwhile, Japan's Obayashi group has pulled out of building Bangkok's third stage expressway. Bankers close to the company say it was disheartened by frequent contract changes and the authorities' inability to agree on land compensation or fix a route.</p>

			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Foreign buying noted as Nikkei hits third new high Buying by foreign investors and some domestic financial institutions left equities with a third day of gains after a strong close, writes Robert Patton in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 average ended 134.62 up at 20,973.59, its third new high for the year in as many days. At one point in the early afternoon a rally sent the index above 21,000 to a day's peak of 21,048.61, where it encountered heavy selling pressure from Japanese non-financial corporations. The low for the session was 20,857.07. Volume eased from 594.8m shares to an estimated 530m. The Topix index of all first section stocks gained 4.17 at 1,682.50, while the Nikkei 300 firmed 0.61 to 307.79. In the first section, rises led declines by 691 to 329, with 164 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 2.51 at 1,391.93. Most heavy electricals continued to advance, Hitachi adding Y10 at Y1,080 and Toshiba Y7 at Y845, but Mitsubishi Electric lost Y9 at Y688. Major industrials and shipbuilders were mixed. Kawasaki Steel, once again the day's most active issue, moved up Y3 to Y426 on a volume of 15,450 shares. Kawasaki Heavy Industries rose Y2 to Y477. The morning's trading started on a quiet note. With markets in London and New York closed on Monday, fewer foreign investors were active. The market heated up in the early afternoon, fuelled by very large buy orders from a foreign brokerage house for leading stocks. Other dealers followed suit, stepping up their purchases. The more positive tone of the market was largely a reaction to projections of corporate profitability in the current fiscal year, and to Monday's release of stronger than expected industrial output figures for April. Most foreign analysts continued to maintain a bullish stance. Mr Rod Smyth of Baring Securities argued that the combination of positive economic data released in the last two days with the technical strength of the market made a breakout above 21,000 'only a matter of time'. But some analysts pointed to the continued absence of individual investors as a negative factor weighing on the market. In Osaka the OSE average rose 104.04 to 23,162.36 as volume of 38.2m shares topped Monday's 35.9m. Roundup The Monday closure of US markets had a dampening affect on activity yesterday. HONG KONG was firmer in muted trading, with the Hang Seng index ahead 29.93 at 9,553.56 but down from the day's high of 9,568.78. Turnover slipped to HKDollars 3.1bn from the previous day's HKDollars 3.5bn. Property issues remained strong following recent weakness, with Cheung Kong and Henderson Land both rising 50 cents to HKDollars 39 and HKDollars 41 respectively. San Miguel, the Philippine-based brewer, shed 10 cents to HKDollars 6.85 on news that it had sold its site in Hong Kong for HKDollars 3.5bn to Wheelock Properties, up 20 cents at HKDollars 19. China Light saw brisk European-led buying push the shares up HKDollars 1.25 to HKDollars 43. MANILA gained 2.6 per cent, with San Miguel leading the way on news of the property sale in Hong Kong. The composite index advanced 79.38 to 3,030.77 as San Miguel 'A' shares jumped 7.3 per cent to 102 pesos and the 'B' stock 2.2 per cent to 141 pesos. PLDT climbed 30 pesos, or 1.6 per cent, to 1,940 pesos. Turnover slipped to 1.2bn pesos from Monday's 1.3bn. TAIPEI fell on profit-taking following rises over the past two days. The weighted index was finally down 42.94 at 5,891.56 after an earlier high of 5,960. Turnover was TDollars 53.96bn. Paper shares were the worst hit: Wan Yu receded 80 cents to TDollars 23.60 and Cheng Loong 70 cents to TDollars 37.30. In the electronics sector, Acer declined TDollars 1 to TDollars 64, while United Microelectronics went against the trend with a rise of TDollars 2 to TDollars 104.50. KUALA LUMPUR slipped back as volume hit the year's lowest point at just 50m shares. The composite index ended off 4.00 at 996.11. Lion Land retreated 13 cents to MDollars 2.77 on profit-taking after sharp gains last week. SINGAPORE eased on light selling of blue chips, the Straits Times Industrial index declining 24.22 to 2,281.67. SEOUL retreated for the third consecutive session in reduced volume as manufacturing stocks continued to consolidate. The composite index lost 6.15 at 939.49. SYDNEY was lower in the absence of major corporate news. The All Ordinaries index dipped 10.0 to 2,081.8 in light turnover of ADollars 354m. CSR, the building products, aluminium and sugar group, remained under pressure, falling a further 13 cents to ADollars 4.80, in spite of announcing strong earnings results on Monday. Analysts commented that investors were disappointed by dividend tax considerations. BOMBAY declined as profits were taken, particularly in the heavily weighted ITC and Reliance Industries late in the session. The BSE index relinquished 4.99 to 3,823.06.</p>

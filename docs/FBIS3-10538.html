Fernando Cortina Legarreta, president of the Confederation  of  Industrial Chambers, has said the economy's "slow" growth rate  will have little impact on job creation, illustrated by the fact  only a number of jobs comparable to the number lost in 1993 will  be created this year. He has said activities in other  production sectors will increase in the coming months and will  speed up until the GNP reaches 3 percent near the end of the  year. He has said the industrial sector is not seeking  refinancing, similar to that in the agricultural and livestock  sector, for its overdue loans and that the private sector and  the Association of Mexican Banks are talking to outline specific  financing plans for every productive sector.

Most of the debt  increase during the period was incurred by the placement of  Treasury Bonds, through which the federal government obtained  approximately 26.2 billion pesos; this amount is equivalent to  65 percent of the internal debt increase during the period.  Circulating bonds representing the government's internal debt  amounted to 168.1 billion pesos up to 16 February, one of the  largest figures since September 1991.

Conversely, the  number of time deposit accounts increased from 2,462,000 to  2,542,000, and the number of checking accounts increased from  3,510,000 to 4,453,000.

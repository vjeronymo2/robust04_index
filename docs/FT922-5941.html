			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Personal View: Stronger than nations The anti-federalist case put by Mrs Margaret Thatcher, the former UK prime minister, and the Bruges Group has the merit of being simple. But in this instance, the consequence of simplifying a complex issue is the distortion of reality. The anti-federalists oppose a system of European Community governance that involves the reduction of national sovereignty. What they have failed to address is the fact that the principle they seek to uphold has already been conceded by binding treaty. EC membership entails the unambiguous rejection of unfettered national sovereignty and this was absolutely clear at the date of accession by the UK in 1973. The principle of the supremacy of Community law was established clearly in the 1960s, as was the doctrine of direct application which gives individuals the right to sue their government for breach of Community law. These developments form part of the foundations of a political structure to which the neologism 'supranational' has been applied. Whatever else may be argued, therefore, one may not suggest that the EC is an intergovernmental structure, nor that the road on which it now finds itself was unidentified from the earliest days. Indeed the Single European Act, endorsed by Mrs Thatcher, not merely expressed the will of all the member states 'to transform relations as a whole among their states into a European union' but also significantly reduced traditional national sovereignty by introducing majority voting into areas previously requiring unanimity. It is no longer a legitimate part of the debate, therefore, to develop a polemic on the basis of retaining total sovereignty. That debate is one about rejecting membership. Those who oppose European integration accuse the Commission of 'exploiting' the Single European Act. It is difficult to know what this can mean as the Commission may only propose legislation and not adopt it. If the principle of majority voting causes concern, let it be recalled that there was no mystery about the issue when it was decided; it was clearly recognised that the '1992 project' could not succeed if one member state could effectively block progress. In other areas, too, the role of the Commission is vital to the creation of the internal market - an objective so strongly advocated by the UK government. The reality is that it would not be possible to envisage the market functioning without effective governance from Brussels. If member states were permitted freely to grant subsidies to industry, this would inevitably distort competition. The fact that the Commission, under an authority vested in it by Article 92 of the Treaty of Rome, may prohibit such aids is a clear infringement of national sovereignty. But is it a power that the anti-federalists would now deny? Similarly, would they deny the power to propose regulations or directives creating competition in air transport or telecommunications? It is unreasonable to argue against regulation from Brussels, particularly when the effect of the regulation is to dismantle protectionism. Like it or not the essential logic of the EC is based upon a supranational vocation. On the political level it is argued by some that the new circumstances of Europe demand a loosening of the ties that bind the continent together. They see enlargement, perhaps, as a way of making the Community unworkable as it currently operates. It would be ironic if the European Free Trade Association countries now so anxious to join a Community with supranational powers were to be the unwitting cause of its disintegration into a loose intergovernmental body such as that which they had left. That, however, seems to be the aim of some in the UK and elsewhere. These critics point to the break-up of alleged federal structures in central and eastern Europe as evidence of the failure of federalism, while ignoring the fact that these failed entities were undemocratic fusions. On the other hand the concept of European union is crucially dependent on democratic sanction. Successive polls of public opinion testify to the broad measure of support throughout the Community. It was extreme nationalism and the experience of the Second World War that provided the stimulus for European integration and the creation of a supranational state. Today we are challenged again by nationalism. A reversion to the traditional nation state is not the way to contest this challenge. The fact that western Europe has enjoyed peace since 1945 while other areas have been traumatised by war is not unrelated to the new way in which we govern our affairs. To return to the earlier world of co-operation between sovereign states rather than integration would be to risk reliving the worst moments of our turbulent history.

			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IT'S A DOCUMENTARY  </P> <P> I feel I have to respond to some of the Feb. 18 letters about the movie "Roger  &amp; Me."  </P> <P> Only a fool (or a member of the motion picture academy's documentary board)  defines documentary as objective nonfiction.  </P> <P> From "Nanook of the North" to "The Thin Blue Line," documentary has inhabited a  region between fiction and journalism. Documentary is a form designed for  filmic essays, and it encourages partiality and bias. I don't know anybody who  walked into "Roger &amp; Me" expecting an impartial overview of the situation  in Flint, Mich. I expected to see one man's view of that situation, and that is  what I saw.  </P> <P> Letter writer Tony Thomas chastises Warner Bros. for having a profit motive in  releasing this film. Warner deserves every penny it makes from "Roger &amp;  Me," and I can only hope it will be encouraged to back many more projects that  will have an equally irritating effect on Thomas and his ilk.  </P> <P> JOSHUA OLSON  </P> <P> Hermosa Beach  </P></p>

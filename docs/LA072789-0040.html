			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WATER BACK-FLOW PREVENTION  </P> <P> The Torrance City Council has voted unanimously to adopt a program to regulate  and inspect back-flow prevention devices that keep private water lines from  contaminating the public water supply.  </P> <P> Formerly, the Los Angeles County Health Department held primary responsibility  for such inspections but because of changes in the state Health and Safety  Code, county health officials notified cities last year the department would  relinquish that role.  </P> <P> Under the program, Torrance Municipal Water Department employees annually will  inspect businesses that use chemicals that could be drawn into city water  mains. They will ensure the firms have properly installed back-flow prevention  devices.  </P> <P> There are about 175 such devices in use in Torrance. City water officials said  they expect that number to increase substantially as commercial and industrial  growth continues.  </P> <P> Charles J. Schaich, a senior administrative analyst for the Water Department,  said the city has promoted one employee and added one new inspector under the  program.  </P></p>

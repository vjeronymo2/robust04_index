			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Goldstar urges the Department to continue to adhere to the CAFC's decision in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Zenith Elec. Corp.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 988 F. 2d 1573 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (Zenith),  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> by adding to USP the absolute amount of home market taxes, Goldstar claims that the recent Federal-Mogul decision failed to recognize the critical distinction between the Zenith holding that the Department may not adjust the foreign market value (FMV) to neutralize tax amounts, and the separate issue of how the adjustment to USP for commodity taxes shall be performed. Goldstar further claims that in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Zenith <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  decision, the Department used an  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ad valorem  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> methodology to calculate the adjustment to USP. This methodology, according to Goldstar, resulted in a multiplier effect on the underlying dumping margin, a result that the Department had argued justified making a tax-neutralizing adjustment to FMV. Goldstar notes that the CAFC held that the express terms of the statute preclude such an adjustment to FMV. However, Goldstar argues that in footnote four of that decision, the CAFC indicated that the Department may lawfully avoid the multiplier effect by performing the adjustment to USP on an absolute basis rather than on an  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ad valorem  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> basis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Daewoo concurs with Goldstar and adds that the Department should not implement the Federal-Mogul decision unless and until it is sustained by the CAFC. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's Position:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We agree with petitioners. The CIT in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Federal-Mogul <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  rejected the practice of making COS adjustments for differences in tax amounts in USP and FMV. Consequently, we have revised our methodology and adjusted USP for tax by multiplying the USP by the home market tax rate at the point in the chain of commerce of the U.S. merchandise that is analogous to the point in the home market chain of commerce at which the foreign government applies the home market consumption tax. In this case we multiplied the U.S. tax base (gross unit price less discounts) by the Korean VAT rate. This product, the U.S. tax adjustment, was then added to the net USP. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With regard to the tax treatment in the home market, we included in the FMV the amount of Korean consumption tax collected in the home market by multipling the tax base (home market gross unit price) by the Korean VAT rate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We also calculated the amount of the tax that was due solely to the inclusion of price deductions in the original tax base ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> multiplying VAT rate by the sum of total deductions and additions). The total amount of U.S. movement and selling expenses was multiplied by the Korean VAT rate and subtracted from the net USP to determine the final USP. Similarly, a total amount of all adjustments in the home market was multiplied by the Korean VAT and deducted from FMV after all other adjustments had been made. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

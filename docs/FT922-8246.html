			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Book Review: The business of sport DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER; THE BUSINESS OF BASEBALL By Paul M Sommers, editor Brookings Institution It has long been necessary to be a lawyer and accountant fully to understand sport in America. To these qualifications must now be added an advanced degree in economics. The thought is prompted by two apparently disparate events. The first occurred on April Fool's Day when 500-odd toothless Canadians, supplemented by Russians, Czechs, Slovaks, Swedes, and even the odd American, closed down the National Hockey League for the first time in its 75-year history. The second is the publication of a truly formidable, but completely engrossing, tome by the Brookings Institution called, deliciously, Diamonds Are Forever, and sub-titled The Business of Baseball. Ice hockey is a sport in some trouble. Wayne Gretzky may be the greatest thing ever to put on skates, including both Torvill and Dean. But its nasty, brutish image, allied to the eternal problems of following a fast-moving puck, means it has no national US television contract. Its players do not seem to understand this. What they have grasped, however, and what the Brookings book demonstrates in econometric spades, is that the best way to earn more money is not nakedly to ask for it but to go on strike in order to change the terms of employment. This is essentially what the off-field history of baseball over the last generation has been all about ever since, in 1969, an outfielder called Curt Flood challenged in the courts the sport's reserve clause and refused to be transferred from St Louis to Philadelphia. ' Curt Flood lost his case when the Supreme Court ruled that baseball was exempt from the national anti-trust laws. But others followed his lead and after a couple of strikes and endless negotiation the reserve clause was confined to the dustbin for all but the youngest and was replaced by the concepts of free agency, individual contracts and binding independent arbitration of salary disputes. The impact on the players' pockets has been dramatic. A recent survey in USA Today newspaper reported that 20 years ago the average annual salary was Dollars 34,000; in 1982 it had risen to just over Dollars 200,000: this year it should exceed a cool Dollars 1m. Yet this has not been ruinous to the sport's viability because baseball revenues have soared with its booming popularity. Where the Brookings book's 10 essays, replete with economic models, extrapolations and charts, is indispensable is in the extent to which it dissects the processes of the changes in the sport's structure, never better than when it addresses the fundamental problem of the link between pay and performance. The starting point is Babe Ruth's famous comment in 1930 when he was asked how he could justify earning more than Herbert Hoover, who happened to be president. 'I had a better year than he did,' the Bambino replied. The Brookings prose is a little more involved, as perhaps it needs to be. Thus Andrew Zimbalist writes: 'A profit-maximising employer will hire workers up to the point where the marginal factor cost (MFC) is equal to the gross marginal revenue product (MRP). The marginal factor cost, in turn, will equal the salary paid to the factor (the player) plus any necessary marginal auxiliary costs that accompany the factor.' Space here precludes going into formulaic ingredients in detail. But there is one killing table, covering the seasons from 1986-89, and seeking to determine, using the MRP yardstick, whether players are exploited or overpaid. It shows that, if anything, players still do not earn enough, though in 1989 a near perfect balance was achieved. But it also proves that the younger the player the greater the degree of exploitation. Apprentices were paid between one-fourth and one-sixth of their net MRP; journeyman performers, with arbitration and free agency rights, earned 50-64 per cent of their MRP; the stars were paid 23-39 per cent above their MRP. In another age it would be called child labour. But a parallel chapter, by Rodney Fort, raises another problem. Player union power in the last 20 years has actually produced greater inequality in pay, contrary to its presumed intent and certainly all its rhetoric. This in turn has probably led to a less equal distribution of talent and therefore a less competitive sport. The fans themselves, the most vocally disgusted over soaring salaries, actually contribute to them by demanding to see what they consider the best; and the best players, especially pitchers, do fill ballparks and owner's pockets. Yet baseball delights in defying the economic statistician. Last year's World series, between Minnesota and Atlanta, was not only contested between two teams who had finished last in their leagues in 1990. They also had lower than average payrolls, because most of their best players were young. A seasonal aberration, perhaps; after all, as Arthur Burns, the Fed's late chairman, once said, seasonally adjusted the Great Lakes never freeze over, and nor, of course, will baseball. Ice hockey should be so lucky.</p>

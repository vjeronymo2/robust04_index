			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Pressure still on WITH NO sign of monetary easing in continental Europe, analysts belive this week could see a renewed bout of pressure on currencies such as the franc, the peseta and the Danish krone. Towards the end of last week dealers reported that informal attempts by European exchange rate mechanism members to shadow their old bands were failing as all bar the D-mark lost value. 'If European countries do not cut rates it seems that the foreign exchange markets are going to force depreciation upon them,' said Mr Michael Burke, economist at Citibank in London. The reluctance of the French authorities to cut interest rates helped the franc recoup some of its lost ground last week, but dealers believe the buoyancy will be short lived. They suspect that the French, Danes, and Belgians are attempting to delay rate cuts until August 26, when the Bundesbank meets again after its summer break. By then monetary authorities may have a better idea of whether another German rate cut is imminent, facilitating a round of cuts elsewhere in Europe. The dollar could rise on the back of retail sales data next week, although the median forecast among analysts is for only a modest increase in July sales. But even the modest strength of the US recovery looks sturdier than any growth likely to be seen in continental Europe this year, and the dollar stands to benefit. Sterling will probably continue to waver this week as expectations for another rate cut stand in the way of a strong advance. It may also suffer from weak domestic data. Economists expect manufacturing figures on Thursday to show that output fell in June, partly as a bounce back from strong May figures but also a reflection of slowing exports to Europe.</p>

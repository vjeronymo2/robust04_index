			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Rank depressed Fears that Rank Organisation will suffer if more British holidaymakers go abroad next year prompted two brokers to turn sellers of the stock. Both tour operator Thomson and Thomas Cook, the travel agent, forecast a 10 per cent growth in the package holiday market for 1994 as they launched their new brochures this week. NatWest Securities and Hoare Govett were both pointing out that Rank's domestic holiday business, encompassing the Butlin's and Haven-Warner chains, could be hit as a result. While NatWest was advising investors to take profits - the shares having performed strongly in the last quarter - Hoare was recommending a switch into Thorn EMI. Rank lost 7 to 792p. Mr Hamish Dickson, leisure analyst at Hoare, said that in contrast Thorn's recent underperformance had been overdone and that the stock also held yield attractions. He added that recent music industry figures showed the potential recovery in the European market and that Thorn was ideally placed to exploit it. Thorn shares had been badly hit two weeks ago by the group's decision to redeem a preference issue early, which could have left around 11m shares in the group overhanging the market. Hoare claims that its latest research suggests it is now unlikely to be higher than 7m. Thorn shares climbed 15 to 952p.</p>

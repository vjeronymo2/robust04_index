			<p>BFN     [Text] Inkatha Freedom Party President Mangusuthu Buthelezi  says he had never tried to have two options with regard to the  acceptance of the election resutls, but that his reservations  were centered around allegations of irregularities during the  election. He spoke to our correspondent at Ulundi today.    [Begin Buthelexi recording] When we went to the elections,  it  was under the understanding that we would accept the results of  the elections, and the only reservation that I had was because  of all the irregularities that were taking place, that made me  reserve my position and say that, you know, well, let's wait and  see what the outcome is. But I don't think that there's any  possibility that I could turn around and say that I don't accept  the results of the elections, if everyone else accepts them.  [end recording]</p>

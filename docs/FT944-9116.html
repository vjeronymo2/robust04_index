			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Labour pulls rug from under Reynolds: A new coalition is possible in theory but general elections are the more likely option The dramatic events yesterday in the Dail, the Irish parliament, leave Ireland facing a period of political uncertainty and cast new doubt over the future of the Northern Ireland peace process. The resignation of Mr Dick Spring, the deputy prime minister and Labour party leader, and his fellow ministers brings the prospect of early general elections and the break-up of the 22-month-old Fianna Fail-led government. It will be viewed in London, in particular, with deep concern. What is all the more surprising is that this is a government with the largest majority in the history of the Irish Republic, a track record of fiscal and monetary rectitude and the fastest economic growth record of any member of the European Union. What is more, the coalition, largely through the determination of Mr Albert Reynolds, the prime minister, has achieved what he rightly claims is the 'biggest breakthrough in Northern Ireland in 25 years' in helping to secure the IRA's ceasefire. With the Dail still in a state of shock, attention will shift today to President Mary Robinson's residence in Phoenix Park. The political odds are that Mrs Robinson, who made history as the country's first woman president, will make history again by refusing to grant Mr Reynolds a dissolution of parliament. Earlier this week she sought consultations with the head of the Bar Council. Under the constitution the president can refuse to dissolve the Dail if a prime minister has ceased to retain majority support. That palpably has now been demonstrated. The current thinking is that President Robinson would give the parties in parliament a fixed period, probably a week, to form a new coalition. If unsuccessful, the government would be forced to go to the country. As far as the peace process is concerned, all parties, as Sir Patrick Mayhew, the UK's Northern Ireland secretary, repeated on Tuesday, are publicly committed to the search for peace as outlined by both governments in the Joint Declaration. However, while the hatching of a new government continues, officials say the negotiations on the framework document to provide a durable peace will have to be put on hold. In such a limbo, there are growing doubts whether London will decide to bring Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, into exploratory discussions by Christmas. If elections turn out to be unavoidable, it could be well into the new year before a new administration is in a position to pick up the negotiating baton on the Northern Ireland peace process. Irish politics it seems has a cruel way of repeating itself. Just two years ago an earlier coalition between Fianna Fail and the Progressive Democrats broke up, on that occasion over allegations relating to the Beef Tribunal, the investigation into the misuse of official export credits. The row between Mr Reynolds and Mr Des O'Malley, the then PD leader, forced an early general election. It seems acutely ironic that the Labour party's strong showing in that election, securing 33 seats, was due directly to the anti-Fianna Fail vote. That the party ended up in coalition with Fianna Fail, the first such coalition in Irish political history, was never envisaged. If Mr Reynolds survived that row, it is inconceivable he can survive the current attacks. Already yesterday there were calls for his resignation. Last night the name being widely canvassed to replace him was the finance minister, Mr Bertie Ahern - ironically the only minister who remained on the front benches together with his party leader throughout his political ordeal. In the Dail, party managers were last night weighing up the options. For Fianna Fail, even with a new leader, a general election would be the only way back. For Labour, the calculation seems more complicated. One choice is to try to cobble together a coalition with Fine Gael and one or other of the Democratic Left or the Progressive Democrats. Current parliamentary strengths would give a narrow arithmetic majority in the 166-seat legislature. The possibility is discounted by some politicians who point to Mr Spring's frosty relations with Mr John Bruton, the Fine Gael leader. Even at the height of his indictment of Mr Reynolds, the Labour leader could not resist scoring a few points at Mr Bruton's expense. The other consideration for Mr Spring is that Labour held six cabinet portfolios in the last government. It is hard to envisage that a rainbow coalition would provide the party with so much visibility. And in bringing the crisis to a head, Mr Spring has almost certainly counted on the prospect of early polls, believing that Labour's performance and the issue of public accountability would play out well for the party in a general election.</p>

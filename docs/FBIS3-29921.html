			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, February 20 (KNS-KCNA) [dateline as received]  -- Japanese figures criticised Secretary General Ozawa of the  Japan Renewal Party for insulting and slandering the DPRK on  FUJI television.    Akira Iwai, chairman of the Japan Committee For Supporting  the Independent and Peaceful Reunification of Korea, in a  statement branded Ozawa's outcry as a deliberate one to foster  among the Japanese people the "suspicion of nuclear development"  by the DPRK. The Japanese people must not be deceived by his  false talk, he said.    Hiroshi Wakabayashi, secretary of the same committee, in a  statement said: "Ozawa preached for `building a system to  counter a crisis,' groundlessly claiming that some change would  take place in the DPRK. This revealed Ozawa's ulterior  intention not only to slander the DPRK but also to malrevise the  constitution and fascistize the government power."    Ippei Koyama, former vice-president of the House of  Councillors, said Ozawa's outcry is just like Japan's past  extensive propaganda about "threat from the Soviet Union" and is  a drama to deceive the people.    Military analyst Ayazo Kubo in a statement said he could  hardly represss indignation, hearing the TV address of Ozawa  devoid of an iota of culture.    Michinao Zuchiya, chairman of the Nagano, Japan, Prefectural  People's Council For Supporting the Independent and Peaceful  Reunification of Korea, in a statement criticised Ozawa's  address as an outburst putting a spoke in the wheel of DPRK-U.S.  talks and antagonizing the DPRK. The nuclear issue on the  Korean peninsula is attributable to the U.S. nuclear weapons  deployed in South Korea, he said.    "The Japanese government must show sincerity for the  improvement of Japan-DPRK relations including establishment of  diplomatic relations," he urged.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Vladimir Taranov] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 14 TASS -- As a result of consultations  among delegation members and experts, the joint meeting of the  Council of CIS Foreign Ministers managed to agree upon a draft  declaration on sovereignty, territorial integrity and  inviolability of borders of CIS member-countries. Insignificant  differences were settled in the course of discussion.    The Armenian delegation is most likely to refrain from  signing the declaration.    A draft convention for ensuring the rights of national  minorities was subjected to more substantial criticism.  Participants in the meeting decided to send the document for  reconsideration by experts.</p>

			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / France dashes Gatt hopes MR John Major's hopes of a breakthrough in the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks at this week's Munich summit foundered yesterday on opposition from France. Although G7 officials said differences had narrowed in the contentious area of farm support, France's President Francois Mitterrand refused to sanction progress, apparently for fear of losing support in September's referendum on the Maastricht Treaty. Mr Major admitted that there was 'no chance of an agreement being reached' in Munich. Report, Page 2</p>

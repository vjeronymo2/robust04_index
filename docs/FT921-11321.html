			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Letter: Cringing at superiority Sir, As a Briton permanently resident in the US I found Christopher Dunkley's review of the 40 Minutes documentary 'Wild Man Gatherings' especially amusing ('A contrast of cultures' - Television, January 29). However, the implied suggestion that these absurd male bonding rituals are widely practised among Americans is quite wrong. 'Wild Man Gatherings' are in fact widely ridiculed by Americans, who are perfectly capable of identifying bogus cant when they hear it. Unlike Mr Dunkley I find that very few Americans make me cringe, but the smug superiority of my fellow countrymen all too often does.

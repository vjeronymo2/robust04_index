			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / Leading Article: Mr Al Gore's big picture A good politician must be able to gaze at the stars but keep his feet planted firmly on the ground. US Vice-President Al Gore has managed to achieve this difficult double trick in his plans for developing an advanced communications infrastructure, which he outlined earlier this week. Mr Gore's star-gazing involved expanding on his vision of a society where all homes, offices, schools and other community bodies would be connected to electronic 'super-highways'. Through these, they would have access to a wide range of 'multi-media' services which could include information databases, video-telephony and interactive computer games in addition to standard telephony and television. But the vice-president also kept his feet on the ground by making clear that the bulk of the investment in networks, services and products would be undertaken by private enterprise. He has largely abandoned earlier suggestions that the state might be involved in constructing such networks. The emphasis on competitive private enterprise is important. It provides the best chance that the vision will be realised, as there is no prospect of finding tens of billions of dollars from state coffers. It also means that investment is likely to be focused on products and services that meet genuine customer needs. A government-sponsored programme could easily have been wasteful, resulting in the provision of services that nobody wanted. Dynamic sectors The telecommunications, cable television, entertainment and computer industries already constitute some of the most dynamic sectors of the US economy. The administration's determination to free them to compete vigorously builds on that strength and should put them in an even better position to perform well in world markets. The spate of multi-media mergers over the past year - including Bell Atlantic's bid for TCI and the battle for Paramount - is evidence of companies' enthusiasm to exploit such opportunities. The main thrust of Mr Gore's proposed legislative package is a bonfire of the regulations which create artificial barriers between different parts of the media sector. These stem from two main sources. First, the 1984 Cable Act, which restricts telephone companies' ability to provide video services over their networks. Second, the 'modified final judgment' which broke American Telephone &amp; Telegraph into one long-distance company and seven regional groups. As part of that ruling, the regional groups known as Baby Bells, were not allowed to provide long-distance services or manufacture equipment because of fears that they would abuse their local monopoly positions to dominate these markets. Monopoly concerns Such restrictions may have been necessary in the interim to enable new players to establish themselves in the cable and telecommunications markets. But they currently serve to limit competition and hold back investment. This does not mean that monopoly concerns can be dismissed, as the Baby Bells remain dominant forces in their regions. The administration therefore sensibly plans two main measures to ensure fair competition. First, telephone companies will continue to be prohibited from taking over cable groups within their regions. Second, network operators will have to act as common carriers for the multi-media services supplied by their competitors. Mr Gore also insists that all Americans should have access to the new super-highways at affordable rates, regardless of their income or geographical location. He is anxious to avoid creating a society of 'information haves and have-nots' and so plans to require service providers to supply even those whose custom does not represent profitable business. While the social advantages of this policy are clear, the administration will need to be careful not to impose such hefty obligations that it deters investment. Overall, Mr Gore has set out an attractive platform which should put the US in a good position to take advantage of the opportunities of a multi-media future. The challenge for the rest of the world is to respond in kind. Otherwise, it will find itself falling further and further behind.</p>

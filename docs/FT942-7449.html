			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / International Company News: Trelleborg recovers as financial costs fall Trelleborg, the Swedish mining and metals group, posted a SKr200m (Dollars 26.08m) swing into the black in the first quarter. The turnround came on the back of lower financial costs and better results from associate companies. The figures keep it on track for a positive full-year result after two years of heavy losses. Group profit after financial items amounted to SKr8m, compared with a SKr192m loss a year earlier. The improvement came in spite of a drop in sales, to SKr4.65bn from SKr5.66bn, and a deterioration in operating profit to SKr67m from SKr170m. Adjusted for disposals and restructuring, sales were up 2 per cent and operating income was SKr95m higher than a year ago. The group benefited from a SKr5.5bn drop in net debt and lower interest rates, enabling it to cut financial costs by SKr145m to SKr109m. It also had a SKr50m contribution from associate companies, instead of the SKr108m loss it suffered in the first quarter of 1993. This reflected a better performance at Falconbridge, a nickel producer, and a contribution from Munksjo, a paper and packaging group.</p>

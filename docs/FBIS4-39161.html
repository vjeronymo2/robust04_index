			<p>BFN     [Text] At the beginning of the morning plenary sitting of  the Supreme Council of Ukraine on 3 June, at the request of  people's deputies Volodymyr Marchenko and Vyacheslav Chornovil,  it was decided that on 12 June the interpretation of several  articles of the Law of Ukraine "On the election of people's  deputies of Ukraine" will be considered.    People's deputy Petro Sheyko said that in accordance with  the  application, Vasyl Durdynets was dismissed from the post of  chairman of the "Center" group. Anton Buteyko was elected its  chairman and Volodymyr Yavorivskyy and Valeriy Kolomoytsev were  elected his deputies.    An issue on the draft law "On introducing amendments and  additions to the law "On the formation of local bodies of power  and self-government," approved at the first reading on 2 June,  was put on the agenda. Serhiy Sobolev, member of the commission  for issues of legal policy and judicial and legal reform,  reported that at the sitting of the commission on 2 June,  attended by all interested deputies, it was resolved to submit  only one amendment for consideration by the session: to cancel  direct elections of chairmen of oblast councils and hold  elections of chairmen of the Kiev and Sevastopol city councils.    According to Serhiy Sobolev, such an amendment to the law  will essentially change the election procedure and, therefore,  relevant amendments should be introduced to the constitution of  Ukraine. After a brief discussion two proposals were submitted  for consideration: one by Serhiy Sobolev and also a proposal by  Vasyl Kornelyuk not to consider amendments to the law at all,  because there is only little time before the elections.    After a break, representatives of groups and groupings were  given the floor to speak on the issue under consideration.  Representatives of National Democratic groups insisted on the  necessity to cancel direct elections of chairmen of oblast  councils because, in their opinion, this would inevitably lead  to the emergence of "25 princes accountable neither to the  Supreme Council nor to the head of state."    Serhiy Holovatyy reminded that the decision on direct  elections was approved at the request of Ivan Plyushch with no  written text available to the deputies and in the absence of a  quorum.    Representatives of left-wing groups as well as the  interregional deputy grouping and "Unity" group insisted on the  necessity of preserving direct elections of chairmen of oblast  councils. By a majority of votes the proposal by the Supreme  Council commission for issues of legal policy and judicial and  legal reform to cancel direct elections of chairmen of oblast  councils was declined,    After this the deputies continued to approve the composition  of the Supreme Council standing commissions.</p>

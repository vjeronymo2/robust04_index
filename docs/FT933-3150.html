			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / UK Company News: BT's Pounds 400m Spanish venture BRITISH Telecommunications is forming a Pounds 400m joint venture company with Grupo Santander, Spain's fourth largest financial services group and parent of Banco Santander, to sell data communications services in Spain. The joint venture will own, manage and upgrade Megared, Grupo Santander's existing data communications network, which covers 31 Spanish cities. The move is a further push into Europe's liberalising telecommunications market. The new company, expected to employ over 300 people when fully established, will offer a range of managed data communications services to Spanish companies and other large users. Megared, set up in 1989 to serve the banking group's extensive branch network, has been trying to expand by attracting third party users. Mr Iain Vallance, BT chairman, said the venture brought together BT's international experience and Grupo Santander's knowledge of Spanish business and its extensive data communications network'.</p>

			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / Survey of Computers in Manufacturing (12): Two for the price of one - Simultaneous Engineering THE time taken to design and manufacture a new product could be reduced substantially if both operations were carried out together, instead of one after the other as was the almost unavoidable practice in traditional engineering before the widespread use of computer power. Working out how to make a product in a mass production process at the same time as the product is designed is the essence of simultaneous, concurrent or integrated engineering, the various descriptions given to an emerging approach to engineering where everything is done at once. This may seem impossible. Yet computers have made it possible for work to proceed on the design of a product at the same time as on the ways of making the product. With simultaneous engineering, the design of a new product takes account of how it will be made, so that the easiest, most economic way to make the product is chosen and is feasible. Traditionally, if a design made it difficult for a company to manufacture and mass produce the product as designed, then the design was modified until the manufacturing difficulty was overcome. The essence of simultaneous, or concurrent engineering is that account is taken of the manufacturing process as the design proceeds, so avoiding redesign at a late stage in the development of a product and its manufacturing process. An illustration of the importance of simultaneous engineering is the way new products are designed using new materials, such as the advanced ceramic materials that are being developed for jet engines. These materials have distinct advantages over the metals traditionally used for these applications, but in order for manufacturers to exploit these advantages to the utmost, they have to take account of how these materials will behave when they are used in production processes. In other words, the production process has to be developed hand in hand with the design of the product. The only way to do this is through simultaneous engineering. Mr James Angus, the team leader at the Rolls-Royce Advanced Ceramics Centre at Warwick University, where integrated engineering techniques are being developed for future jet engine components, says the integration of design engineering, materials science and manufacturing technology is essential for the new ceramic materials because, for the first time with any material, the designer has the opportunity to design the material to suit exactly the properties needed in a component. This unusual way of designing a product or component has to take account of the way the product will be manufactured and mass produced and vice versa, otherwise the carefully tailored material properties of the component could be lost. Ms Sue Lyons, the director of manufacturing engineering at Rolls-Royce, says 'we are moving towards completely integrated or concurrent engineering across the company.' The integrated programme is being finalised and all technology groups, such as stress and mechanical engineers and manufacturing specialists will come together at the conceptual design stage of a new product. Ms Lyons says 'the division between design and manufacturing could disappear altogether.' The change to integrated engineering is crucial because of the high proportion of a product's cost that is set at the design stage. In the case of a jet engine as much as 80 per cent of the cost of a new product for the engine is fixed at the design stage. The aim is to reduce this fixed cost element in a product by designing it so that it is easy to manufacture. It is possible to influence significantly the final cost of a product, including its manufacturing cost, by the addition of only very little extra cost at the design stage. Mr Robin Blake, of Rolls-Royce says that 'concurrent engineering is not an alternative for consideration, it is an absolute necessity. The demands to reduce lead time and cost can only be met by teamwork in a concurrent engineering environment.' Computer systems available to handle concurrent engineering include systems from Intergraph, one of the world's largest companies developing and manufacturing interactive computer graphics for computer aided engineering. Intergraph won an order last year, potentially worth Dollars 40m, from the US Sandia National Laboratories for systems with a concurrent engineering capability. The agreement called on Intergraph to supply hardware and software for the Nirvana project, the code name for the Sandia National Laboratories/US Department of Energy programme to implement a computer aided design and manufacturing system with a concurrent engineering capability. Nirvana was designed to help Sandia, which is the US Department of Energy prime contractor for nuclear research, and its sub-contractors to move from using multi-vendor, non-integrated solutions to particular problems to a more efficient integrated approach. In the first year of the agreement, Intergraph will supply a range of engineering design software tools and about 140 of its Risc-based UNIX workstations. The hardware and software will be used to integrate and improve the design, manufacture and assembly of complex electronics-based products. These tools will operate under a common user framework. Product design information will flow from initial system design, through sub-system design, the design of printed circuit boards, hybrid and integrated circuit design through mechanical design and on to manufacturing, including document publishing. Additional data is to be added to the design definition at each step and design data from preceding steps will not need to be re-entered. Mr Dick Fox, the UK marketing director of Intergraph says the result will be high quality products designed and manufactured in a shorter period of time than would otherwise be possible, one of the objects of concurrent engineering.</p>

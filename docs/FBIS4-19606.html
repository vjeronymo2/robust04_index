			<p>BFN     [Text] Geneva, April 20 (AFP) -- Red Cross staff and  doctors working for an international medical charity based in  besieged Gorazde decided Wednesday [20 April] to remain silent  for 24 hours to protest against the Serb offensive and their  inability to help victims of the heavy shelling.    Paul-Henri Morard, spokesman for the International Committee  of the Red Cross [ICRC], said two ICRC staff in the war-torn  town and two doctors for Medecins Sans Frontieres [MSF--Doctors  Without Borders] announced the decision in a statement sent to  Sarajevo.    "They announce their intention to remain silent to protest  against the tragic events in Gorazde and their inability to  provide help," he said.    The ICRC, whose staff avoid taking sides in the many  conflicts where they offer humanitarian assistance, said it  sympathised with the protest.    "They are profoundly dismayed.... They are unable to collect  the wounded and assist the victims on all sides," Morard said.    The four foreigners, along with four members of the UN High  Commissioner for Refugees [UNHCR], have until now provided  information to the outside world about the Bosnian Serb  offensive against the Moslem enclave in eastern Bosnia.</p>

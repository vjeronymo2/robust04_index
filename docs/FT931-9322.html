			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / Construction Contracts: Severn crossing project BALFOUR BEATTY CIVIL ENGINEERING, part of the BICC Group, has been awarded the second Severn approach roads contract, in the County of Avon, by the Secretary of State for Transport. Worth more than Pounds 60m, this contract is the fifth the company will have under way in and around the Bristol area. The 143-week project comprises the construction of 14km of dual two-lane motorway, split into two sections of six kilometres and eight kilometres apiece. The new motorways will provide the links between the M4 motorway, between junctions 20 and 21, and the M5 motorway at junction 18 to the second Severn crossing, currently under construction. Interchanges will be provided at the M4 and M5 motorway junctions, together with an additional interchange on the approaches to the second Severn crossing. To construct the embankments, 1.8m cu metres of imported fill will be required. The project comprises 17 overbridges and six underbridges of which some are seven to nine spans, a footbridge, subway and a reinforced concrete trough structure to carry the motorway under a British Rail bridge. As part of the works, bridges will be demolished over the M4 and the M5 motorways, under the A403 and one under Redwick Road. Realignment of side roads, including the A403, lighting, landscape bunding and regrading all form part of the contact.</p>

			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / The very model of a modern risk: Efforts by UK banks to ensure capital is allocated to operations with the best real returns At 7.30 yesterday morning, UK banks crossed a threshold. National Westminster Bank reported the first fall for three years in its debt provisions. The bad risks taken by the clearing banks in the late 1980s are finally starting to recede into history. Yet banks are not just looking back on the recent past with relief: they are also vowing never to expose themselves to the same degree of danger again. Risk is at the heart of banks' traditional business. They lend money at rates of interest, taking the risk of default. But the boom of the late 1980s and subsequent recession taught them a harsh lesson: they had exposed themselves to far bigger risks than they realised. Banks' share prices are now trading at a 15-year high relative to other industries, partly because investors believe their earnings will not be allowed to swing so wildly again. The fluctuation in earnings between the late 1980s and now led to banks' capital being eaten away when they started sustaining losses on lending. At the same time, lending margins were reduced by competition and large companies borrowing money on the capital markets. Banks have concluded that they must find ways of making money other than simply lending it, because the old margins on lending do not cover risks adequately. The initial response has been to diversify into operations which produce fees and commission rather than interest. In retail banking, this means selling life insurance and other financial products. On the corporate side, it means capital markets and securities operations. But underlying this is a questioning of whether banks should carry on lending money under the same conditions as in the past. The most extreme reaction to the emergence of unforeseen risks would be to stop lending completely. US banks such as Bankers Trust have been cutting down the number of loans they hold on their balance sheets, while seeking new trading income. It would be near inconceivable for UK clearing banks, with their huge range of retail and wholesale businesses, to stop lending. But it is quite likely that they will increasingly avoid lending that carries higher risk. Bankers insist, however, that they will not retreat. 'If we were not going to take any risk, we could just buy US treasury bills and not employ anyone,' says Mr Richard Goeltz, National Westminster's chief financial officer. But others admit that there is at least temporary caution. 'Banking got a monumental shock in the 1980s, and it takes time to recover,' says Mr John French, head of risk at HSBC Group. Banks face a harder task than just recovering their nerve. There are several ways in which business may be riskier than in the past. One is that lending mistakes will not be nullified by asset price inflation: a rise in the value of the underlying security, such as property, will not bail out debtors. A second is that the growth in the use of derivatives - new financial instruments - like currency swaps may increase risks such as exposure to other traders. More broadly, banks are increasingly operating in an open environment in which their mistakes are exposed to both public comment and regulatory punishment. Mr Mervyn Pedelty, head of risk management at TSB Group, says the bank treats compliance and image as elements of risk. 'The reputation of a business like ours is very important, because you cannot sell products to customers if you have a poor reputation,' he says. Faced with these challenges, banks are now trying to devise methods of better assessing risk. They are taking a lead from Bankers Trust, which developed measures of return on capital, weighted by risk, to choose where it should allocate funds in trading operations. The intention of risk-adjusted return on capital (Raroc) measures is to ensure that the bank allocates its capital to operations with the best real returns. NatWest has started to assess its operations against two measures of risk-adjusted return. It has calculated returns over past business cycles to measure both the average annual return in each operation, and the minimum likely return in poor years. It is trying to identify not only how profitable its operations are, but also how volatile their returns are, and thus how exposed the bank is to cyclical swings. Mr Goeltz says the analysis has been thought-provoking, but he is unwilling to discuss which operations it raises doubts about. 'There are a couple of real shocks, things that defy the conventional wisdom,' he says. He argues that the process provides the bank with a useful discipline. 'With the figures, you can challenge managers. You can say: 'Here is what you are going to have to do to make a return,' ' he says. The question is whether the model can be used to do more: can UK banks start to allocate capital according to risk models? Most banks doubt the validity of such a notion for two reasons: first, because they are more complex businesses than Bankers Trust, which focuses on securities trading and derivatives; second, branch managers may encounter difficulty applying the results of an analysis. The range of activities in a large British bank is such that it is extremely hard to compare them. 'Our trading operations may have nice mathematical tools to manage risk, but we have no means of comparing the profitability of sterling swaps to mortgages, or US credit cards,' says Mr Goeltz of NatWest. In addition, banks may lack sufficiently reliable data to judge the risks of lending. Trading in securities and capital markets is rapid enough to produce a store of data, but credit risk is governed by long-term economic cycles. Few banks have data going back far enough. And their most recent information has been drawn from the extreme and probably atypical economic conditions of the late 1980s. The second problem of introducing risk analyses is practical. Dealers may understand the notion of trading positions based on limited allocations of capital, but such a way of working is alien to lending managers. Mr French says HSBC has not adopted such measures because they are unlikely to be understood well enough to be useful. 'You can produce the most sophisticated measures going, but if your people do not comprehend them, they are no good,' he says. Mr Martin Cruttenden, head of risk management at Lloyds Bank, argues that Raroc models do not suit big retail banks. Models may lend direction, but they are not a means of running operations. 'The only area of operations where we feel the need for that degree of analysis is our treasury,' he says. At the branch level, he believes there is 'no substitute for a manager's intelligent knowledge of the customer'. Yet whether risk models are used is not the most important question. More vital is how banks' behaviour will be changed by their general sense of increased risk. They have already shown signs of trying to reduce their exposure. Banks' assets are weighted according to how risky they are thought to be, and the ratio of risk-weighted assets to total assets has fallen from 80 per cent to 70 per cent over the past five years. So although balance sheets have not contracted, higher-risk assets such as commercial loans have shrunk as a proportion of the total. As banks enter a period of limited lending growth, a continuing shift in the mix of assets could result in real cuts in some forms of lending. The most obvious targets would be lending to small businesses on which bad debts have been high, and some industrial sectors such as construction. Bankers resist such a suggestion. 'Of course our managers who have had their fingers burnt do not forget it easily, but our job is to manage risk, not to avoid it,' says Mr John Davies, deputy chief executive of Lloyds. Yet there are reasons beyond the strict logic of risk management for bankers to seek forms of lending which avoid the extremes of high profits in good times, and heavy losses in the odd bad year. The risk models may find nothing wrong with holding a mix of assets which produces such high returns in most years that it offsets exceptional losses, but neither bank investors nor executives are likely to agree. The high share prices enjoyed by banks at the moment have emerged because fund managers believe that banks have started to even out the old cyclical swings in earnings that used to plague them. Banks are therefore likely to prove cautious about simply plunging back into high-margin and high-risk lending, such as property, that attracted them so disastrously in the past. Avoiding such risk may please bank shareholders, but it will have unknown effects on the financing of economic recovery. Banks may have crossed a threshold yesterday, but the customers who come to them for loans could come to regret the achievement.  ----------------------------------------------------------------- UK BANK CAPITAL*  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Pounds bn            1988      89      90      91      92  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Total capital        36.22    38.23   36.95   38.09   40.18 Total assets         392.8    461.7   471.1   476.8   535.6 Weighted assets      315.4   377.1   374.9   364.8   378.5  ----------------------------------------------------------------- * Top eight Source: Bank of England Banking Act Report 1992  -----------------------------------------------------------------</p>

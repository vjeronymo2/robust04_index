			<p>BFN     [Text] Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis has stated  that any further discussion of the confidence-building measures  [CBM's] is subject to the Turkish side accepting the two  unofficial documents proffered by the United Nations. He added  that the process for implementing the CBM's has been terminated  due to the negative stance of the Turkish side. The UN  secretary general's representatives, the spokesman said,  submitted proposals that they considered to be fair and to meet  the concerns of each side. The Greek Cypriot side, the  spokesman continued, cooperated in full and reacted  constructively, in contrast with the Turkish side. Kasoulidhis  also stressed that no political advantage the Turkish side is  trying to gain through the CBM's process can be accepted.</p>

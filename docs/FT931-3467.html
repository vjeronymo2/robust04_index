			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Letter: Perfectly clear Sir, Your comment ('Major must persevere', March 10) that 'Paddy Ashdown wants his party to be noticed' and use of the word cynically were regrettable and unworthy. The Liberal Democrats have made it perfectly clear that they will use every endeavour to obtain ratification of the Maastricht treaty. Equally that they will do all possible to ensure that the social chapter is included. Nothing could be clearer than those aims and I am sure they will vote accordingly. It is a pity that others are less clear and constructive. Innes Hamilton, Christchurch Road, Virginia Water, Surrey.</p>

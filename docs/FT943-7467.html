			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / US group digs deeper into UK undertaker Service Corporation Inter-national yesterday more than doubled its 'strategic' stake in Britain's second largest funeral business, Plantsbrook, to 8.4 per cent, and the US company said it intended to buy more. Mr Peter Hindley, Plantsbrook's chief executive, said he had received no communication from SCI, but commented: 'I doubt whether they would want to be a long-term passive shareholder; that's not their style.' SCI, North America's largest burial company, has sent shockwaves through the sombre world of UK undertaking this summer. It launched and won a hostile bid for Great Southern Group and followed this up 11 days ago with the purchase of a 2.9 per cent stake in Great Southern's largest listed competitor. In the Great Southern bid, SCI took on the Field family, which controlled 56 per cent of the company. Plantsbrook also presents a formidable hurdle in the form of France's largest burier, Pompes Funebres, which owns 46 per cent. Mr Hindley said: 'The French have said they are happy with Plantsbrook and it has become a large part of their business.' But with deregulation of the French funeral industry affecting its market share, Pompes Funebres faces some difficulties at home. Plantsbrook's share price rose 12p to 175p yesterday, compared with 100p prior to SCI's expression of interest, providing the French with an option to sell for a substantial profit. It is understood that SCI has spoken to Pompes Funebres. There is little geographical overlap between Great Southern and Plantsbrook. If the latter were acquired, SCI would have a UK market share of close to 15 per cent. However, the purchase of Plantsbrook's Dignity in Destiny, a scheme for pre-payment for burials, would give SCI a large part of the so-called 'pre-need' market, due to the pre-eminence of Great Southern's Chosen Heritage plan. This might result in a bid referral to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. SCI also announced yesterday that all investors who sold shares in Great Southern on August 2 and 3 could apply for compensation - due to an error in an offer announcement - by submitting claims to its brokers, Cazenove, by September 17.</p>

			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / France to reform stock options The French government has set up a committee to examine reforming the rules governing stock options following recent criticism of the remuneration of senior company executives. Stock options give the recipient the right to buy shares in a company at a future date at a fixed price, which is usually below the market rate at the time they can exercise this right. They allow pay to be partially tied to performance - as measured by a company's share price  - and are subject to favourable taxes in France: just 19.4 per cent capital gains tax compared with a marginal tax rate of nearly 60 per cent for highly paid executives. Mr Jean Arthuis, a member of the French senate, called for tougher tax rules on stock options when the latest finance bill passed through the legislative body last month. Mr Arthuis' concern was partly triggered by a fear that the rules on options have been exploited by companies and their advisers. The rules were changed at a time when a number of senior executives were becoming eligible to exercise the options awarded to them in earlier years and did not want to have to wait before selling their shares. Mr Arthuis's proposal is to reintroduce income tax on the capital gains made when options are sold by executives, unless they have waited at least one year after the options were granted before selling them. This requirement was repealed by law last year and currently only capital gains tax is imposed. The French ministry of finance stressed that manipulations of stock options would be severely punished, but that control was more likely to be achieved through the tax authorities than legislation. 'There has been a fear that some people have been manipulating the rules,' said Mr Eduardo de Martino, of accountants Arthur Andersen, yesterday. 'But there have been no cases in the courts. Let's try to find out the people who have done it rather than changing the rules.' The renewed examination of stock options comes as a growing number of French companies are using them as a way to remunerate senior executives. Although first permitted in the 1970s, Mr de Martino said options had gained popularity in the last few years with buoyancy on the stock markets.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Luciano Violante, Italian Democratic Party </F> of the Left lower house deputy speaker, by "F.L.S."; place and  date not given -- first paragraph is L'INFORMAZIONE introduction]    [Text] Yesterday Luciano Violante, PDS [Democratic Party of  the Left] member and former magistrate, elected to the Chamber  of Deputies in the fifth legislature, became one of the new  deputy speakers at Montecitorio [Chamber of Deputies].    [Correspondent] You are well aware that you are among those  whom your opponents love the least. Is your election a "slap in  the face" to the majority?    [Violante] As a lower house deputy speaker, it is not my  task  to lead or manage the opposition, but to cooperate with the  house speaker for institutional reasons. In this transitional  stage in politics, the institutions must be solid. If they are  rickety, the transition may become painful, and it may become  harmful too.    [Correspondent] What is your opinion of the new speaker  [Irene Pivetti]?    [Violante] I spoke to her for the first time when she was  elected. Yesterday morning, before the election of the  speaker's office staff, I went to pay my respects to her, as is  my duty. The chosen speaker is the speaker of the house as a  whole, and thereby loses any partisan characteristics. I am  sure that Deputy Pivetti also will fulfill this role.    [Correspondent] Let us speak of the progressives. There is a  great turmoil at grassroots level, a powerful thrust toward  unity....    [Violante] New developments are taking place within the  Left.  The challenge lies in whether we will be able to keep pace with  them, so as to channel them into a government proposal. Two  days ago, in the Chamber of Deputies, the great majority of the  progressives elected a cultured man with political experience,  but one who is certainly a newcomer, as their floor leader:  Luigi Berlinguer.    [Correspondent] The parties are misfiring. Do you think that  the parliamentary group will become the leading center of  progressive politics?    [Violante] I believe that parliament will become a leading  center of progressive politics, but not the only one. There is  the problem of building progressive politics, as well as the  problem of social opposition, which must be tackled by the  parties. We must also wage a great cultural battle. The Right  waged such a cultural battle, and it won because it was able to  convey its views into public opinion.    [Correspondent] You do not often speak of your own party,  the  PDS. A great debate is now taking place on the leadership.  What do you make of it?    [Violante] I believe that there are no leaders appointed in  heaven. Besides, look at developments. The country's  leadership has been taken over by a force that did not even  exist three months ago. There are many in the PDS who are  qualified to take over the leadership. But the real problem  within the PDS lies in building a leading group which, overall,  can respond to the pressing need for novelty. A secretary who  cannot rely on a good leading group can do very little on his  own. This problem is also apparent at the local federation  level. I see an extraordinary potential, for example, in the  Left's youth.    [Correspondent] Does leadership of the PDS mean the same  thing as progressive leadership?    [Violante] No. They are not one and the same thing today.  And I believe that they will not be for a long time to come,  not until we can build a progressive party for government. The  PDS should not pose the leadership problem in terms of the  leadership of the progressive coalition as a whole. They are  two different things.    [Correspondent] Like [PDS Secretary] Occhetto and [PDS  Deputy  Secretary] D'Alema....    [Violante] The congress will be held in the fall. We must  promote a great, honest, and serious debate. It would be  ruinous to reduce this to a choice between two people, to a  problem of succession to the leadership.</p>

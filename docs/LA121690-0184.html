			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TRUST FUND SET UP TO AID WIDOW, BABY SON  </P> <P> A church has established a trust fund to pay the medical expenses of the wife  and son of a Mission Hills man killed last month by a suspected drunk driver.  </P> <P> Members of Santa Rosa Catholic Church in San Fernando set up the trust fund  after Daniel Miramontes, 26, a youth minister at the parish, was killed Nov. 11  when his car was struck by a speeding vehicle.  </P> <P> The accident occurred in San Fernando at Glenoaks Boulevard and Harding Avenue  as he and his wife, Diana, who was eight months pregnant, drove home from  church. Diana Miramontes was critically injured and taken to Holy Cross Medical  Center in Mission Hills. Their son, Daniel Miramontes Jr., was born by Cesarean  section hours after the accident.  </P> <P> Both mother and son are recovering, but remain hospitalized. On Friday, Diana  Miramontes took her first steps since the accident, said her father-in-law,  Frank Miramontes. The baby, who was transferred to the intensive care newborn  nursery at Valley Presbyterian Hospital in Van Nuys soon after the accident, is  improving, his grandfather said.  </P> <P> The church has collected almost $7,000, the Rev. David Ullrich said.  </P> <P> Miramontes left a job as a printer in March to work full time with the youth  group, Proyecto Amistad, or Project Friendship. Although insurance is paying  the hospital expenses, Frank Miramontes said the family will need help to pay  for later medical expenses.  </P> <P> Donations may be made to the Danny and Diana Miramontes Trust Fund at the Santa  Rosa Catholic Church Credit Union, P.O. Box 630, San Fernando 91341.  </P></p>

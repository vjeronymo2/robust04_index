			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / The Property Market: Prague awaits a second revolution - The low level of building activity in the Czech city Prague's commercial property market is slowly emerging from the stranglehold of 40 years of communist control. But the virtual absence of cranes above the city's elegant skyline shows that it has not been a spectacular transition. Prague's beauty is part of its appeal for foreign companies wanting a foothold in eastern Europe. But the need to preserve the city's heritage is also a barrier to the tide of modern office development. Foreign investors' high expectations following the overthrow of the communist regime in 1989 have been further dampened by worldwide recession, excessive red tape and concern about the split between the Czech lands and Slovakia. 'Progress is slower than a lot of people originally anticipated,' says Mr Richard Steer of Gleeds, the quantity surveyors, which has an office in Prague. Mr Michael Hodges of Jones Lang Wootton (JLW), chartered surveyors, says that the initial flood of enquiries from developers interested in the Prague market subsided 'when they found they could not get through the bureaucratic barrier'. Nonetheless, the market is slowly developing. The early days after the revolution, when there was a wild scramble for office space led to monthly rents of up to DM100 a square metre. Today, prices have stabilised and the letting market is more open. Leases, for example, now tend to be between two and five years and modelled on those of Austria and Germany. Before the revolution, buildings were let on the basis of a 'commercial agreement', a document which merely stated the names of the landlord and tenant. But developers and investors must still contend with inadequate telephones, poor infrastructure, disputes over land ownership, and difficulties in getting planning permission. The confusion over land ownership is being resolved; Czech citizens have been allowed to claim property confiscated between 1948 and 1990, provided claims were filed by September 30 1991. However, several claims to the same parcel of land have created problems. Construction is also becoming easier in Prague. Until recently, it was difficult to acquire materials locally. Before the revolution, when companies ran out of materials they sometimes abandoned work. The materials for Prague's Atrium Hotel, for instance, were brought by truck-load from France. Gleed's Mr Steer says that it is now possible to use local construction groups for most jobs except the installation of lifts and air conditioners. As a result, construction costs can be 30-40 per cent less than in the UK. Other problems, such as foreign investment, have been exacerbated by the break-up between the Czech lands and Slovakia; political uncertainty has frightened potential investors. But these fears are overdone, in the view of Czechs, who believe that Slovakia will be the loser from the political split. They say that the Czech lands have attracted the bulk of foreign investment and have a more diversified economy that contributes between Dollars 300m and Dollars 1bn in subsidies to Slovakia every year. The relative affluence of the Czech lands is underlined by the presence in Prague of international retail chains such as clothes retailer Benetton, McDonald's, the fast-food chain, and furniture supplier Ikea, and the sale of western goods in shops. Nonetheless, political uncertainty is checking the expansion of western companies. So too, in some cases, is the civil war in the former Yugoslavia. 'A surprising number of foreign investors are ignorant of where these places are,' says Mr Chris Bennett of accountancy firm Price Waterhouse, which has offices in Budapest, Prague and Warsaw. Tourism in Prague has also levelled off. In sharp contrast to the experience of the past two years, hotel rooms are now obtainable at short notice. Some developers suggest bureaucracy is also becoming more entrenched as officials become more burdened with the paper work associated with the transition to a market economy. Permission to build the Atrium Hotel, for instance, needed to go through more than 100 stages of approval. (Prague, the Czechs recall, provided the bureaucrats of the Austro-Hungarian empire.) The difficulties of getting planning permission are largely due to the city's desire to preserve its baroque heritage, which means that most development work will be confined to refurbishment. There are some exceptions. In the case of the European Business Centre, the first new office building to be completed since the revolution, the developers, the Vienna-based European Property Development company, set back the facade to accommodate four more floors. The difficulties in the market are not wholly the fault of obstructive bureaucrats. Much of the problem in assessing how the market will develop lies with the overambitious and underfunded developers. Many schemes have been proposed and then dropped. 'Some entrepreneurs raising bank debt created a bigger animal than they could cope with,' says Mr Angus McIntosh of Healey &amp; Baker, chartered surveyors. 'They bit off more than they could chew in terms of finance and planning permission.' The Czech authorities' slow decision making and the unreliability of foreign developers also hamper the compilation of statistics about the market. JLW has had a rough stab at estimating market size; it says that 10,000 sq m of refurbished office space is available, while another 40,000 sq m is in the pipeline. Nobody can be certain about how demand will respond when the developments comes on stream. JLW says rental levels will eventually be sustained by the emergence of local businesses able to afford modern offices. Rents will not sink below a monthly rate of DM50-DM55 a square metre, it predicts. Among foreign investors, Germans, followed by Americans and Austrians, lead the pack. French companies have also been active. The largest office development project under construction in Prague is the 24,000 sq m International Business Centre, built by CBC, the French construction company. Another prominent site in the city centre will be developed by France's La Caisse des Depots et Consignations. In contrast, there is little sign of an investment market developing in Prague. Some buildings have come on to the market after they were reclaimed by their former owners. However, these properties were offered at inflated prices, resulting in few sales. According to JLW's Mr Hodges, an investment market might develop over the next 12-24 months, if the country attains political stability and if there is sufficient investment class property. He predicts that Prague's property market will reach the same stage of development as Budapest in a few years. For all the problems that investors and developers have encountered, most dealers in the market are optimistic about its future. 'In five years it could be a blue chip market,' says Gleeds' Mr Steer. Mr Phil Hudson of property consultants East 8 agrees. 'The potential is tremendous,' he says.  ------------------------------------------------------------------ RENTAL GROWTH (%)  ------------------------------------------------------------------                       Retail   Office   Industrial   All Properties  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Year to July 92        -1.6    -13.4      -5.6          -7.0 Quarter to July 92     -0.6     -3.6      -2.5          -2.1 Month of July 92       -0.2     -1.3      -0.7          -0.7  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Source: Investment Property Databank  ------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

It Is Time To End It"]    [Text] These words in the president's message to the  Federal Assembly cannot fail to instill cautious optimism.  Indeed, after three months of equivocation and hesitation, it  is time to get down to business.    Most inspiring of all was the president's unequivocal stance  on inflation, which "is inflicting huge damage on the reform  itself and on the quality of the lives of the population and the  economy as a whole." "The crisis is insuperable in conditions  of unchecked inflation," the president believes. After numerous  dubious statements from individual government members and  competing pseudoprograms, this is more than timely and should  promote the cessation of fruitless discussions.    The president's indication of the need to establish by the  end of 1994 a level of inflation of 3-5 percent per month, which  certainly hardly squares with the statements of the prime  minister and the acting minister of finance, is a real  sensation. Still tougher are the president's words concerning  the verification of all actions of the authorities to ensure  that they carry no inflation risk to the state. Otherwise, the  president's direct intervention cannot be ruled out, up to and  including the exercise of his constitutional powers.    The president could not have expressed himself more  uncompromisingly. Now the question arises: How will the  government react? It has twice already postponed its session  and more often speaks of inflation priority in terms of 10 or  15-18 percent by the end of the year. For the information of  those who are interested: The president's guideline of 3  percent means a 40-percent growth of prices per annum, and the  government's guideline, even at 10 percent (which is  improbable), represents a more than threefold increase of  prices. The difference is collossal. How are these  incompatible guidelines to be squared?    Inflation is a fundamental issue of reform. In order to  crush it, political will and decisive actions to reduce  expenditure are necessary. At the moment we are being offered  an extremely dubious budget deficit of 50 trillion rubles [R],  R19 trillion of which is proposed to be funded from external  sources. I will not say any more about the budget's inflated  tax revenue, but who can seriously expect to receive more than  $10 billion from abroad? Or as much as R4.5 trillion in revenue  through issuing securities? You can dress up the figures as  much as you like, but not to that extent. Be sensible.    Two months have passed, and all the Central Bank's credits  for the first quarter have already been spent. On what legal  basis will expenditure in March rest? When will the budget be  presented to parliament, and how quickly will it be possible to  adjust it to suit the president's wishes? In its current form,  even if it is accepted as correct, it does not correspond even  to inflation of 10 percent per month. Either the government  will take decisive measures, or it will act against the  president.    Inflation can and should be stopped quickly. The investment  process should be stimulated, and public savings encouraged.  For this, political will and a ruthless battle against  mismanagement, corruption, and incompetence are needed. People  are needed who are capable of making decisions, accepting  responsibility, and achieving results, and not simply beating  their chests and saying: "We will never retreat."    It is time to stop putting up with chameleons and  lickspittles who sell their convictions with every new gust of  the political wind. Meanwhile, they continue to drive out  original thinkers and efficient people from the organs of power  on ridiculous pretexts. The latest example is Kupriyanovskiy,  chief of administration in the president's administration....  Of course, one man does not decide everything. But it is  individual people in their sum who determine policy. The  composition of the government is mirrored in policy. Today it  is not clear who can, and who conscientiously will, implement  the line denoted by the president.    I do not agree with the description of the president's  message as a party congress speech. Read the text carefully,  and everything will become clear. The message contains a host  of specific ideas on investments, payments, the standard of  living, and agrarian and industrial policy. Quite a lot is said  about the Central Bank, which is to be transformed into a  federal reserve system, and about relations between the regions  and the center.    Most importantly of all, the message gives an objective  analysis of the situation and the progress of reform in the last  two-and-a-half years. There are many references to specific  mistakes, inconsistency, and economic policy becoming dependent  on political confrontation. The government's failures are  repeatedly indicated, and the possibility of decisive  intervention by the president is unambiguously hinted.    It is also highly important that not one word in the  president's message supported a shift in economic policy, the  talk of the "end of economic romanticism," or a transition to  certain "nonmonetarist methods" in the struggle with the  stop-start nature of inflation. It is clearly stated: The  course is to be the same as before, but it must be more  consistent, considered, and professional.    Now, Boris Nikolayevich, specific actions are expected from  you and the prime minister. It is the government's duty to  provide specific calculations of economic policy and of the  guidelines for the year, including on inflation, the standard of  living, and other highly important socioeconomic indicators, so  that at the beginning of next year it can be said that  everything possible has been done for the revival of Russia.    A few days remain until the government session. The pause in  the reform process has become protracted. It is time to end it,  and it is possible to end it.</p>

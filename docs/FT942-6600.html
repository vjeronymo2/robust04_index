			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Further German rate cuts forecast German interest rates should continue to fall 'for many months to come' in spite of the recent strong growth in German money supply, a new study from Lehman Brothers, the US investment bank, argues today. After a week in which Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank president, added to the gloom in financial markets by damping expectations of step-by-step cuts in German interest rates, economists from Lehman Brothers' London office said that 'in the near term' they 'expect continued reductions in German interest rates'. Although M3, the broad measure of money supply, grew at an annualised rate of 15.8 per cent in April, well outside the Bundesbank's 4 to 6 per cent target growth range, the Lehman Brothers paper argued that Germany's credit boom 'is over'. Lehman's team of international economists is headed by Mr Gerry Holtham, formerly a senior economist at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in Paris. They said Mr Tietmeyer had been right to claim that M3 has been swollen by exceptional factors. Outside the property sector, where lending has been boosted by changes in the tax treatment of mortgage interest payments, the annualised growth of lending has slowed sharply to about 5 per cent. Lehman Brothers said the Bundesbank should only worry 'in the unlikely event that M3 does not decelerate in the coming three to six months'. Only if broad money continued to grow by 15 per cent until the year-end, should the Bundesbank react and raise interest rates, because that would be a sign that bank credit was growing quickly. Late last week, Mr Tietmeyer clarified his bearish comments by explaining that he had been referring only to the Bundesbank's official discount and Lombard rates and not to the 'repo' rate which it steers in its money market operations. Some economists still expect official German rates to fall further. Mr Ulrich Ramm, chief economist of Commerzbank, one of Germany's big banks, said the Bundesbank was likely to lower its discount rate by a further half percentage point to 4 per cent by the end of 1994. Writing in Borsen-Zeitung, a Frankfurt financial daily, Mr Ramm forecast that the Bundesbank would 'continue its policy of cautious interest rate cuts' until some time in 1995.

			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / International Company News: Fuji Heavy expects third consecutive annual loss FUJI Heavy Industries, the Japanese automobile manufacturer, yesterday revised down its forecast for results to the year ending this month, and now expects to post a pre-tax loss of Y4bn (Dollars 34.7m). This compares with a previous forecast of Y1bn pre-tax profits and would mean the third consecutive year of losses for the company. Fuji Heavy said the main reasons for its revised forecast were the continuing weakness of demand for automobiles, the yen's appreciation and Y1bn of stock appraisal losses. Sales for the year are expected to be Y870bn, instead of Y900bn, and after-tax losses Y8.5bn instead of Y1bn. Fuji Heavy will incur extraordinary losses of Y10bn due to the poor performance of Subaru of America, its US subsidiary.</p>

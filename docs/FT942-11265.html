			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Euro straitjacket created on works councils Sir, Mr Bert Thierron reassures us (Letters, April 29) that works councils will neither cost very much nor delay management decisions. However, the 18 agreements he cites were freely concluded and are therefore tailor-made to suit each company's individual needs, thus minimising costs and red tape. The Commission's lastest draft would force all companies into a rigid, bureaucratic straitjacket which ignores the infinite diversity of company situations. The apparent freedom it gives to negotiate any formula for information and consultation is an illusion; in the event of failure to agree, the minimum conditions in the annexe to the directive are mandatory. The annexe offers no choice. It imposes creation of a central European Committee with attendant rigidities and bureaucracy. Urged on by trade unions, workers will take the annexe as a starting point for negotiations, not because it improves information and consultation; on the contrary, it will seriously interfere with many successful existing company information systems. Unions will insist on the centralised European Committee as a major step towards realising their ambition for pan-European union structures and collective bargaining. This unvoiced ambition has driven this project for 24 years, but cannot be the stated aim of a Commission Directive, since the right of association is expressly excluded from the scope of EU competence by Article 2.6 of the 'Social Chapter'. The Commission's White Paper rightly blames the rigidity of Europe's labour markets for our failure to create jobs. Yet its draft directive on information and consultation will only add to these rigidities, unless the the annexe is modified so that companies and their workers have freedom to devise the formula best suited to their individual needs. No single formula decreed by Brussels can possibly be right for all companies, in all four corners of Europe. The Treaty says a directive 'shall be binding as to the results to be achieved . . . but shall leave to the national authorities the choice of form and methods'. The present directive fails to respect this requirement. It is not too late for the Council of Ministers to build the required flexibility into this directive, and especially its annexe, thus sending positive signals to those who would invest in Europe, while fully satisfying workers' needs for guaranteed information and consultation.

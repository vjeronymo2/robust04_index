			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Observer: All agog Two City giants seek lyrically-minded companions for adventure in verse leading to possible publication. Gog and Magog's little tome, Poems from the Square Mile, piqued Observer's interest sufficiently to attempt to run to earth the two coyly anonymous scribes. No doubt well-informed by virtue of their privileged position guarding the entrance to the Guildhall, the pair recently penned an irreverent collection of verse and worse depicting the London financial community at work and play  -the likes of 'If Walt Whitman had been a BCCI depositor', or, with apologies to William Shakespeare, 'Where the firm sucks, there suck I'. It transpires that Gog, alias barrister Anthony Belchambers, first put pen to paper out of 'exasperation' and 'tedium' when, as general counsel to a lobbying group, the so-called joint exchanges committee, he was earning his crust attempting to cut through the growing tangle of rules and regulations in the financial world. Initially horrified at the idea of his specialist outfit stooping to poetry, Cambridge publisher Martin Woodhead was won round to the idea, and is even keen enough to want to repeat the exercise. But newly appointed executive director of the Futures &amp; Options Association, Belchambers is too busy (and too far back inside the establishment fold?) to provide his share of the 1994 sequel. Magog, who wishes to remain anonymous until he retires in about a year, will offer some material, and Gog's pen has not dried up entirely. But Woodhead wishes to tap the talents and frustrations of a broader section of City folk. Aspiring scribblers, teenage upwards, should submit copy, anonymously if they wish, by the end of February 1994 to Martin Woodhead, managing director; Woodhead Publishing Limited; Abington Hall, Abington, Cambridge CB1 6AH.</p>

He has told  TIESA's reporter Jolanta Zilinskaite about his first official  duties.    [Zilinskaite] It is said that a new broom sweeps clean.  With what duties did you begin work in your new position?    [Stankevicius] I am continuing the work begun by others. I  have participated in the creation and restructuring of the  social security system for several years. Although being pushed  around as a chess piece, an individual enjoyed a minimum of  security in socialist times. As we are trying to move toward a  modern market economy, we must understand that all principles of  social security are changing in essence. A human being must  begin to provide for himself or herself, while the key task of  the state is to help those who really cannot survive without its  assistance. Our country is still very poor. Thus, we cannot  pay such benefits to unemployed people all year round as in  other states, which would be sufficient to live on.    The Seimas [parliament] and the government must draft  definite laws, while a person should receive assistance at his  or her place of residence. So, we want to assist local  self-governments in organizing such work. We think that local  social security services should expand such activities more  actively. We have definite proposals how to help them. The  state has assigned some means for this, while the EC, which is  ready to help us, has promised to supply the aforementioned  services with computers through the PHARE [Poland and Hungary  Action for Restructuring the Economy]. This is one of such  broader initiatives, while my everyday work is routine.  Although much criticized, the social insurance system "Sodra,"  is doing its work, as well as the labor exchange. Services for  retraining of adults encounter more difficulties. They should  help jobless people react quickly to the current situation -- to  either improve their skills, learn new jobs, or engage in  private business. It is very important that the State Labor  Inspection get down to serious work, because many job injuries,  accidents, and occupational diseases still occur in Lithuania,  and a "black" labor market is emerging, where the people are  unprotected.    I agree with the criticism that social security is not  sufficiently balanced. There are many pressing problems that  are even hard to list. For example, we compensate part of the  expenses for urban pensioners, while rural pensioners who buy  expensive fuel do not have such compensation. [passage omitted]    [Zilinskaite]Does state assistance reach primarily  those who require it most of all? What is to be done to prevent  those who can earn a living on their own from collecting  benefits?    [Stankevicius] The larger part of assistance really reaches  such people. However, there are different cases. I think that  one or another trader from Gariunai [large market-place in the  suburbs of Vilnius] receives unemployment benefits from the  Labor Exchange.    What must be done to prevent this? First of all, the state  must have such a mechanism that would assess the real income of  each citizen. The law on the declaration of income is,  probably, the best outcome. However, this is not so simple.  Therefore, we do not intend to idle about. We are drafting  proposals to toughen existing laws.    [Zilinskaite] People's life is hard, while the state  budget coffers are empty. There are no means for supporting all  those who cannot earn a living. While the Seimas is debating  the budget for next year, I would like to ask you whether there  are any possibilities for assigning more money from the budget  for the poor?    [Stankevicius] Even if all of next year's budget was  earmarked for social security, this sum would not be too large.  Seriously speaking, the social sector receives about 43 percent  of the budget money. This includes both health care and  education, because all three of these issues mean social  security.    We must help the needy. However, the most important issue  today is to create conditions for profitable jobs. Currently,  about 7 percent of Lithuanian residents receive the lowest  reward, that is, 48 litai a month. We are often reprimanded for  this. Even the average pension is only 103 litai. Certainly,  we could increase the minimum wage to 90-100 litai. However, if  they become mandatory, no one would be able to pay less, and the  number of jobless people would climb several times. That is why  we are discussing which is better -- to leave people without  work straight away or allow them to earn something, because we  have no means to support the unemployed. Neither of these  options are good!    [Zilinskaite] It looks like the number of jobs will  drop considerably next year. How are you going to create new  jobs?    [Stankevicius] The official current figure of jobless people  in Lithuania is 30,800. However, that is only the tip of the  iceberg -- many people work part-time, some of them are on leave  without pay, while others simply do not apply to the employment  office and earn a living anyway they can.    I think that the restructuring of industry will bring many  enterprises to bankruptcy in the near future. We are preparing  for mass unemployment. I pray that our predictions do not come  true. I suppose, however, that we may have about 200,000  jobless people by the end of the coming year. The experience of  most countries shows that the constant unemployment rate is  about 10 percent. The same is likely to inevitably occur here,  at least until the economy gets back on its feet.    Private structures must create new jobs. The possibilities  of the state are very much restricted. Therefore, it is  necessary to grant credits and tax privileges to businessmen,  and create the most favorable conditions for foreign  investments. Employment is the outcome of the state's economic  policy. [passage omitted]</p>

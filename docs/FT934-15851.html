			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Long-term unemployed '52% of Ulster jobless' UNEMPLOYMENT in North-ern Ireland still outstrips the rate in mainland UK, with 52 per cent of the unemployed out of work for more than a year, an advisory body said yesterday. The Northern Ireland Economic Council says in its annual report that unemployment in Ulster, at just over 14 per cent, is lower than a year ago. But it is still substantially higher than the UK average of 10.4 per cent. Output per head is only 77 per cent of the UK average, it adds. Far-reaching structural adjustment would be required to close the gap in living standards between the province and the rest of the UK, it says. Although the economy has performed comparatively well over the last year relative to the UK, unprecedented growth rates would be needed to bring it up to mainland UK standards within the next decade. To help eradicate structural weakness in the economy, the council recommends increasing industrial research and development undertaken local-ly and improving the proficiency of the local workforce. It says that long-term unemployment is the most severe manifestation of weakness, and suggests that resolving the problem should be at the forefront of decisions on how to spend structural funds from the European Community. The council recommends that reducing long-term unemployment should form the basis for the community support framework for 1994-99, which states how EC structural funds are to be spent. The outlook for Northern Ireland is 'uncertain', it says. Annual Report. Northern Ireland Economic Council, Bulloch House, 2 Linenhall Street, Belfast BT3 8BA. Free.</p>

			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Rise in call volumes takes BT up 8.5% Steady growth in call volumes enabled British Telecommunications to lift pre-tax profits 8.5 per cent in the three months to December 31, allowing for increased redundancy charges and other one-off items. At Pounds 698m, pre-tax profits were notionally down on the Pounds 705m made in the third quarter of last year, but redundancy charges totalled Pounds 142m against Pounds 17m. The payroll on December 31 was 164,600, some 6,100 down on March. BT projects a net reduction of 12,000 for the year as a whole and a similar loss next year. It has shed 80,000 posts since March 1990. Turnover for the quarter was up 4.5 per cent at Pounds 3.43bn, and for the first nine months it was 3.9 per cent ahead at Pounds 10.2bn. Analysts showed some concern at BT estimates that long-distance weekend call volumes had risen by only 20 per cent since rates were slashed by nearly half in early December, implying a significant revenue shortfall. BT emphasised that the 20 per cent figure was based on only eight weeks' traffic and volumes could be expected to rise as familiarity with new tariffs grew. But analysts saw it as indicating difficulties ahead as BT is pushed into more aggressive price competition with Mercury, and with new entrants such as the cable companies building combined phone and television networks. Benefiting from lower prices and a reviving economy, inland telephone call turnover rose by 3.9 per cent in the third quarter, against 2.3 per cent for the first nine months. Increased volume outweighed the effect of discounts introduced by BT to fend off growing competition. International traffic growth was strong, with call turnover up 8.3 per cent in the first nine months. The recent boom in mobile telephony benefited Cellnet, BT's cellular joint venture with Securicor, helping turnover in the 'other services' sector to rise by 3 per cent in the nine moths to Pounds 2.28bn. But increased marketing expenses restrained profit growth. Earnings per share in the third quarter were 7.3p (up from 7.2p), but 6.3 per cent up allowing for redundancy payments and other one-off items. BT will soon have to pay Dollars 3.5bn (Pounds 2.39bn) to close its deal for a 20 per cent stake in MCI, the second largest US long-distance carrier. It stands to gain about Dollars 2bn from the sale to AT&amp;T of its stake in McCaw, the US cellular operator. At December 31 its gearing stood at only 10 per cent, with net debt of Pounds 1.38bn. Sir Iain Vallance, BT chairman, said: 'It is encouraging that we continue to achieve steady volume growth despite growing competitive pressures'. The results were in line with City expectations. BT shares closed 1 1/2 p down at 455p. Lex, Page 18</p>

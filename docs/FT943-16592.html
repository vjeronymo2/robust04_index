			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Management: Cooking up deals in a motorway cafe Next time you find yourself having a cup of coffee and a stale Danish pastry in a motorway service station, look around you. What are those men with briefcases doing at the next table? Are they travelling salesmen comparing double glazing brochures? Or are they tycoons stitching together a secret deal? Forget the Savoy Grill: big business these days is done in motorway cafes. This information comes to me from a senior partner at one of the biggest accountancy firms, who spends half his life travelling from a Welcome Break on the M25 to a Happy Eater off the M1. If you want to be discreet, smart restaurants are out, as are the offices of the other party and their advisers. To meet in any of these places would be tantamount to issuing a press release. The service station is the ideal solution: handy yet anonymous. Everyone else is too intent on bolting their snack and getting back on the road to wonder what fellow travellers are up to. Alternatively, you could meet in the middle of a field where the likelihood of running into journalists or business acquaintances is even lower. But you might look conspicuous there, and you couldn't get a cup of coffee - not even a bad one. We all know about downsizing, rightsizing, rationalising and other euphemisms for firing people. Yet until last week I had not come across 'involuntary separation'. Nor had the 1,200 Du Pont employees who on Thursday were bounced into this process by their employer. There is no acceptable way of telling people that they have been sacked, but companies nevertheless continue to search for the perfect, painless phrase. According to consultancy Drake Deam Morin, there are more than 50 cliches in common use among managers giving their workers the chop. They talk of 'careers that have plateaued', of 'decruitment', 'deselection' and 'displacement'. They speak of 'exiting the organisation', of the 'opportunity to look elsewhere', of 'releasing people', of 'retrenchment', of employees being 'surplus to requirements'. They say: 'your future lies elsewhere' or 'we are re-engineering'. The aim is to place the moral responsibility somewhere other than on the employer. Du Pont's 'involuntary separation' is particularly blatant, and well it might be. The company has its motto - Part of Our Lives - to live up to. I had a leisurely time last week, having picked up the extra second on Friday courtesy of the Central Bureau of the International Earth Rotation Service. Now that I have acquired the taste for additional time, I long for a whole extra hour - which would bring Britain into line with the rest of Europe. It is bad enough trying to get hold of anyone in this country during the business day - they are permanently in a meeting, out at lunch, or travelling from one motorway service station to another. But pinning down anyone on the Continent is more or less impossible. There are only four hours - between 9 and 11 in the morning and 2 and 4 in the afternoon - when there is any point in even trying. The rest of the time either side is at lunch or in transit somewhere. Technology buffs would have you believe that in the age of the virtual company people can be reached 24 hours a day, so time zones don't matter. As someone who has just bought an answering machine, I have found out this is nonsense. The beauty of technology is that when properly used it makes you less, rather than more, available. On my interminable journey into work on Wednesday I read the Financial Times Annual Report Service, trying to guess what business each company was in from the pictures on their annual reports. I could just see the link between autumn leaves and the French funeral service company, OGF/PFG. But what has the smiling black man in a jungle wearing a sheet over his shoulder got to do with Norsk Hydro, the Norwegian oil and metals group? Why have Credit Suisse and Telus Corporation both chosen pictures of rowers for their annual reports? Why does Scor, the French reinsurance company, have a child's drawing of tents and elephants on the cover, or Sema, the information technology company, have a botanical drawing of a bud? If you strain, you can make the connection between rowing and team work, or buds and growth. But why should investors have to strain? When it comes to annual reports we are not talking about metaphors, but about hard facts. My favourite reports have a clear picture of the product on the cover, or failing that, the company's name and the date. This information should also be down the spine, and the format should not change from year to year. You would have thought this was too obvious to be worth saying. But ICI has chosen a different style every year for the last five, each worse than the last. Last year it just said 'annual report' on the spine. This year, nothing at all.</p>

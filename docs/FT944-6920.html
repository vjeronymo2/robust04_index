			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / As They Say in Europe: Mafia sets example on crime Reading the British press one would hardly have known that the UN Conference on crime was taking place in Naples for most of last week. Only the speech by Italy's prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, which came just as it was announced that he was being investigated for corruption, aroused a vicarious flicker of interest. In Brussels the conference was front page news. La Libre Belgique shouted: 'Organised crime finds who it is talking to.' That was followed by a story about the Belgian justice minister, Melchior Wachelet, who made what the paper saw as a hard-hitting speech on the 'complementarity of global and regional approaches' to crime busting. The story alongside gave the game away: 'Drugs and Holland pinpointed in CTIF report.' The CTIF is a Belgian government unit for cracking down on money laundering. The report said BFr21bn had been identified as part of such operations. But only three per cent of that sum had been traced and frozen. The other big Brussels daily, Le Soir, was equally excited: 'Belgium arms itself against organised crime.' Again it gave pride of place to the concept of a regional strategy. It would, unfortunately, be misleading to say that all Belgium is girding its loins in the everlasting struggle against delinquency and the Dutch. In Flanders, priorities were different. Het Gazet van Antwerpen led on 'The warmest November of all time'. As always with this paper, its stories are hard to check, like another front page item, lifted from London's The Times. This concerned an impending invasion of plastic ducks threatening England because a container ship had shed its cargo in the North Pacific two years ago. Het Gazet lives in some curious make-believe world, half-way between Tolkien and Breughel, but without the crime. That may account for the curious news-from-nowhere quality of whatever emerges from Flanders. Back at the UN conference in Naples, Pierre Mehaignerie, the French justice minister, added his voice to the call for 'the greatest international co-operation' in fighting crime. He also focused on what he called 'fiscal paradises', arguing that offshore banking centres should be tackled with as much vigour as the international community had applied to the supporters of international terrorism. The French do not like unregulated business activity and the threat should be taken seriously. After all, in 1985, New Zealand got the rough end of the French stick when government assassins arrived from Paris to blow up the Rainbow Warrior. Then it was Iraq that was clobbered and now, apparently, it will be Guernsey. In highlighting crime blackspots of the world, the Italian paper La Stampa also singled out the Channel Islands, rather than Naples. Everybody finds someone else to blame for crime. The Belgians have to protect themselves against the Dutch. The Russians pointed out that their supposed crime wave was merely the creation of a 'cold war style' propaganda campaign designed to hold up their country's development. The choice of Naples as the site of a conference on crime was intriguing. The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung dealt with the puzzle - at considerable length, inevitably. It stressed the 'high expectations of the population'. The Neapolitans had greatly enjoyed the G7 Summit there in July, for during that period there had been no litter on the streets until eight in the evening. It has become a kind of golden age in the Neapolitan popular imagination. There are many reasons to believe that a city like Naples was the right choice for any such conference. So long as the camorra is squared beforehand, it can guarantee security far more reliably than the police. After all, a car can be parked in perfect safety with the key in the ignition by a guest at a mafia wedding. And anybody who attended the G7 Summit in Naples knows how the highest moral standards were assured. A large number of young women of outstanding physical attributes were in attendance. But even the rougher end of the journalistic corps kept its distance once officials announced that these were the daughters of the leading local godfathers. But unfortunately the crime wave was spreading to the most unlikely places even as the crime fighters met. As someone who has lived at different times in Vienna, I had thought that traffic rules there were inviolable: one was physically restrained from crossing an empty street by other pedestrians when the lights were green. But research, according to Der Standard, has now shown that drivers jump one red light in 10. That means two million cars cross on yellow every day. Almost like a Mediterranean city, said the paper.

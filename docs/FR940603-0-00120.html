			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> II. Summary of Comments Received <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One hundred and thirty-nine public comment letters were received. Comments were received from seventy-eight federal credit unions, six state chartered credit unions, one state regulator, thirteen state credit union leagues, seven national credit union trade organizations, and two individuals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board also received comments from thirty-two banks and banking associations. Briefly summarized, the bank commenters argued that federal credit unions are permitted to expand only within a single common bond, and that federal credit unions should be subject to tax like banks. The NCUA Board, in currently ongoing litigation, has repeatedly stated its disagreement with banking organizations' position on various matters regarding field of membership issues. The question of taxation has been decided by Congress and the President. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In general, the credit union commenters partially supporting or opposed to the proposal argued that NCUA should go even further in liberalizing chartering and field of membership policy. For example, the vast majority of commenters favored deleting operational area requirements altogether for select group amendments. Though the credit union community's desire for more flexibility in accepting new members is understandable, the NCUA Board is unwilling to make the significant changes suggested in operating rules that have served the community well for so long. The Board, in the final IRPS, has adopted a more conservative approach to change. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the same time, the Board has noted the continuing decline in the number of credit unions and the lack of new chartering activity in recent years. The final IRPS makes significant changes to existing policy to encourage new chartering activity, particularly in low-income areas. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

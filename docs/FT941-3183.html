			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / Technology: Globalisation prompts exodus - The rise in US companies' overseas R&amp;D spending Are US companies losing their taste for research and development activities in their own country? If so, how much does this matter? The answer to the first question seems to be yes, based on the latest figures for US industry's R&amp;D spending from the National Science Foundation's (NSF) survey of 23,000 companies in its report, Science Indicators 1993. Funds committed to R&amp;D abroad have soared - they rose nine-fold between 1985 and 1991 - while the amount spent in the US has stagnated. The second question is tougher, since world business trends make it inevitable that companies will spend more on foreign R&amp;D. Thus says Proctor Reid of the Academy of Engineering: 'It is not clear that the larger number of dollars being spent overseas would have been spent on R&amp;D at home, had they not gone abroad.' As with the take-off in US overseas capital investment in 1970s, Reid says the build-up of foreign R&amp;D to support US companies globally is a natural development which will strengthen them at home in the long run. Globalisation is one of the three main forces behind the exodus of US industrial R&amp;D abroad. But it affects other countries, too. According to Manuel Serapio, a business professor at the University of Colorado: 'Not only are US companies moving R&amp;D abroad, the Japanese are increasing their R&amp;D investment in the US and Europe, while Europe is increasing its R&amp;D investment in the US and Japan.' As US industry moved more manufacturing operations abroad in the 1980s, design and engineering followed. Serapio notes that companies have two kinds of motives. One is to tailor products they already make in a local market; the other is to test an untried region. The second force is the worldwide spread of knowledge. In the post-war decades, the US dominated the knowledge base for most advanced products. Now, not only Europe, but Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Latin America generate innovation, too. Third, foreign science and engineering workers can be much cheaper; software that would cost Dollars 1m (Pounds 600,000) in the US might cost just Dollars 50,000 in India. Under these powerful influences, US industry spending on R&amp;D abroad rose after the mid-1980s; it went from a level equivalent to 6.4 per cent of the sum spent in the US in 1985 to 11.3 per cent in 1991. The total of Dollars 8.7bn spent abroad in 1991, the last year for which the NSF has data, was a record. While overseas R&amp;D spending has accelerated, US companies' R&amp;D spending at home has stayed at Dollars 65bn in real terms. Moreover, industrial research managers predict flat or declining R&amp;D spending in the US, according to the Industrial Research Institute. As much as three-quarters of the non-US R&amp;D effort is in Europe. In Germany, the focus is mainly on R&amp;D in the motor industry. That in Britain and France is mainly in chemicals and drugs. Only 6 per cent of US overseas R&amp;D investment goes to Japan. The areas in which US companies tend to concentrate their foreign R&amp;D efforts are: Cars. US motor concerns spend the most on R&amp;D in the US, but do not release figures showing changes in domestic R&amp;D. In 1988, they spent nearly Dollars 1.5bn on R&amp;D overseas, a sixth of that year's R&amp;D total. Today, US car makers spend at least Dollars 2bn a year in Europe. Chemicals. Drugs and medical groups increased their overseas R&amp;D three times over in 1985-91, while their US R&amp;D did not even double. Software. The survey revealed a 672 per cent leap in 'non-manufacturing' companies' overseas R&amp;D spending in the same period. Though this was only Dollars 121m of the total spending on R&amp;D overseas in 1991, it included the significant area of software. This is one area in which modern communications easily allows companies to obtain access to skills abroad.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article] </F>   [Text] The Hata government has made a full-fledged start  after Prime Minister Hata delivered his policy speech to the  Diet on 10 May. In handling the economy, the Hata government is  likely to focus on resuming the stalled Japan-U.S. economic  framework talks in May and reforming the current tax system in  June. The fragile Hata government, which abruptly finds itself  standing at a crucial juncture, is frantically looking for a  breakthrough. The prime minister and other officials are making  full contacts with U.S. Government officials in an effort to  resume the stalled framework talks, and they intend to resume  the stalled framework talks during May, at the earliest. Moves  are afoot within the government to study the possibility of  reforming the current tax system in a way that is acceptable to  the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ]. What holds the key  is whether the Hata government can coax the SDPJ and other  political parties into supporting its reform program for the  current tax system in line with the prime minister's  "cooperative" policy that attaches importance to dialogue with  opposition parties.    The government is committed to mapping out a package of  concrete measures in June to open the Japanese market, and key  elements of the package will be the tax system reform, addition  to the planned amount for public works projects, and  deregulation. The government will have to map out the package  just prior to the summit talks of industrialized nations (Naples  summit) in July. The Ministry of International Trade and  Industry believes that if the government maps out a halfway  package, "it would undercut Japan's effort to patch up relations  with the United States and adversely affect the Naples summit."    The Finance Ministry says with a strong sense of crisis, "If  the package falls short of meeting U.S. demands, it would worsen  Japan- U.S. relations and the United States would increase  pressure on Japan to further appreciate the yen, throwing cold  water on Japan's economy." In his policy speech to the Diet,  Prime Minister Hata stressed that he would work on mapping out  the package.    With regard to the stalled Japan-U.S. economic framework  talks, the prime minister conversed by telephone with President  Clinton on 9 May and an idea is abruptly surfacing within the  government to send a vice ministerial official to the United  States. The government intends to study how to respond to the  U.S.-proposed objective criteria after confirming the real  intent behind the U.S. proposal. The government plans to resume  the stalled framework talks after Foreign Minister Kakizawa  meets with U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor during the  ministerial talks of the Organization for Economic Cooperation  and Development (OECD) scheduled for June.    In the tax system reform, the government calls cutting the  income tax and raising the consumption tax a "national task,"  and there are moves to explore ways for holding tax system  reform discussion with the government, ruling coalition parties,  the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], and the SDPJ participating.  The idea is surfacing within the government's Tax System  Research Council to study the possibility of adopting a plural  tax rate system that holds down the consumption tax rate on  food, which the SDPJ has long advocated. The government is  revealing its posture to get the LDP and the SDPJ participate in  the tax system reform discussion.    Some are saying in whispers that once a budget bill for the  fiscal 1994 is enacted, the mood for dissolving the House of  Representatives and holding general elections would grow, thus  destabilizing the political situation. If the general elections  are set to held, there would be moves to defer the tax system  reform. Therefore, it fears that the Hata government would face  an impasse in handling the economy.</p>

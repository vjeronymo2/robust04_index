			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Kantor and Brittan see Gatt progress - Further round of talks next week US and European Union negotiators claimed in Washington last night to have made progress on the issues blocking agreement in the Uruguay Round and agreed to meet again next week in Europe. After less than two days of talks, Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, said he and Sir Leon Brittan, EU trade commissioner, had defined the remaining issues dividing them 'in all their aspects', discussed viable alternatives, and agreed to reach a preliminary accord to bring to the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade talks in Geneva. Their aides will continue talks in Washington this week. Sir Leon said: 'There is a long way to go and many important concerns which can't be met at the last minute.' He was to meet later for a 'photo opportunity' with President Bill Clinton but did not expect to continue negotiating. On the agenda was the usual round of issues: agriculture, audiovisual matters, aircraft, market access, services, rules for a multilateral trading organisation. Mr Kantor called on the 'larger nations' and Japan to increase their offers on market access, services and agriculture. Meanwhile, US industry lobbyists were anxiously awaiting the outcome of talks, fearful that their groups might be left out of a final settlement. On agriculture, some said there were indications that the US might consider attaching a side letter to the controversial Blair House accord to 'clarify' the deal in a way that might satisfy French objections. One of the most prominent lobbyists, Mr Jack Valenti, a former presidential speechwriter and long-time head of the Motion Picture Association, was demanding an audio-visual agreement which would free new television technologies from EU restrictions and guarantee equal treatment for foreign and domestic films and television programming. Mr Valenti hinted at a willingness to compromise on the EU's current voluntary quota system for television programmes. An EC-proposed standstill on protection might be acceptable, he said, 'because only the French, Italians and Spanish have any quotas, and only four or five other countries have them in the rest of the world'. Another issue on the agenda, market access, was getting close scrutiny from the Semiconductor Industry Association, which has long sought an elimination of electronics tariffs against EU opposition. The SIA saw its hand strengthened last week when 10 of the 14 Asian-Pacific countries, including South Korea, agreed at last week's Seattle summit to support duty-free status for electronics providing there were 'comparable commitments from our trading partners'. The SIA has the support of its European counterpart for 'improvements' in the current negotiating draft on intellectual property rights. Most pernicious, in its view, was a 'compulsory licensing' provision which appeared to permit a government to force a patent holder to license his work.</p>

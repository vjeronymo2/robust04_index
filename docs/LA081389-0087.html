			<p><P> August 13, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLAN FOR WATTS FUTURE  </P> <P> The July 9 article by Leon Whiteson, "Watts Towers: Symbol of High  Expectations," was a positive and refreshing view of an otherwise maligned  Watts community. As members of the Watts Los Angeles/Design Action Planning  Team (LA/DAPT), we would like to offer some clarifications to Whiteson's  article.  </P> <P> Whiteson states the plan ". . . has the ambition to transform Watts into one of  the region's major economic centers by exploiting its location next to the new  transportation corridors now under construction. The cultural arts complex  would form the focus of the long-range proposal."  </P> <P> The plan does not say that Watts should become one of the region's major  economic centers. The plan does say that Watts' changing, ethnically diverse  residents should have an active role in the plan-making process to decide how  much, what type and where economic development should occur, just as the people  of the Westside wish for their own communities.  </P> <P> Major economic development in Watts may provide jobs if there are educational  and training programs for its under-skilled residents, and if developers are  directed toward projects which benefit the community. But make no mistake,  development will also destroy some of the area's proud social relationships,  cultural heritage and affordable housing.  </P> <P> The plan describes a public participation process which would help residents  understand the changes and trade-offs, create constituencies, and introduce  tools and methods of negotiation.  </P> <P> In other words, the plan is a tool for empowering the people of Watts through  education, community organization and the arts. Human development is the key to  developing Watts. The proposed Watts Towers cultural arts complex is one part  of this puzzle, as are the equally important but gang-torn library, school  campuses and parks. The "Challenge of Change" recommends improving these and  other facilities and programs.  </P> <P> Watts has many characteristics of a Third World country. It is a depressed area  unable to contribute to or benefit from the wealthy First World region  surrounding it. Oversimplification of this dichotomy, as implied by the  article, consternates problems and raises false expectations. These problems  call for new models and methods of planning, which develop understanding and  shared visions, create wealth equitably and can be implemented. Ultimately, the  LA/DAPT process must be judged in these terms. The city's Planning Department  should be supported for moving positively in this direction.  </P> <P> MARC FUTTERMAN  </P> <P> ELLIOT JOHNSON  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P> <P>  Futterman is co-facilitator of Watts LA/DAPT, and Johnson, a team member.  </P> <P>  Leon Whiteson replies: The Watts LA/DAPT report states, on Page 31, that the  ambition of the plan is: "to transform Watts into one of the region's major  economic centers...." The participation of the community, emphasized in the  report, was also emphasized in my article.  </P> <P> </P></p>

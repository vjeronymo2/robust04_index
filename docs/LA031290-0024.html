			<p><P> March 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUCHANAN ON COLLABORATORS  </P> <P> Buchanan's column is the worst poison-pen writing I have read for some time.  </P> <P> To equate the efforts of "liberals" to obtain decent living and working  conditions for American citizens with Nazi collaboration to murder millions of  civilians is not only incredible, it is satanic.  </P> <P> Surely the American right to free speech allows any citizen to talk and to work  politically for fair and decent living conditions without the kind of moral  slander and smearing Buchanan expresses. Why did The Times allow such toxic  material to be printed?  </P> <P> JANE OLIVER-ALLEN  </P> <P> Lucerne Valley  </P></p>

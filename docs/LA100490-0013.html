			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> BUZZIN' 'BIRDS  </P> <P> When there's no keyboard in sight, just a row of fretboards lined up next to  the drum riser, you know you're in for a Guitar Band. This durable,  alternative-rock subgenre got a slight twist at the Whisky on Tuesday from the  Hummingbirds, who are from Sydney, Australia.  </P> <P> Not that the two-man, two-woman outfit stands far apart from such U.S. brethren  as Let's Active, the dB's and the Feelies. The 'birds' debut album "Love Buzz"  was produced by power-pop guru Mitch Easter, and on stage they displayed the  same allegiance to '60s pop values, a punk-inspired intensity, and a fondness  for making their guitars buzz, squeal, roar, ring, jangle, shimmer, chop,  rattle, whoosh and sometimes play a tune.  </P> <P> Few of the solos were conventionally musical; mainly, they were intensifying  exchanges of percussive charges, or racing strums that took them into the realm  of pure rhythm. They also offered some into-the-breach heroics, a bit of  Television's lock-step design -- but not much showmanship. RICHARD CROMELIN  </P></p>

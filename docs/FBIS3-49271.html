			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] We have just received the latest report from  Bonn. Jozo Curic has the latest news.    [Curic] The second round of talks between Presidents Tudjman  and Izetbegovic ended several minutes ago. The talks were  initiated by the Croats, and I have learned from well-informed  sources that the talks followed the old pattern. The Muslims  accept Croatian peace and cooperation proposals in general but  reject individual specific elements. Presidents Izetbegovic and  Tudjman will meet briefly tomorrow morning and this will be  followed by a plenary meeting. [passage omitted]</p>

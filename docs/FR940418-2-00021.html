			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We chose the second approach for several reasons. First, it is the Department's policy to try to ``tie'' subsidies to the subject merchandise whenever possible (see GIA at 37267). Second, since the Finsider group was very large, consisting of numerous state-owned steel producers, only one of which produced the subject merchandise, we believed it would be more appropriate to focus our analysis on the producer of the subject merchandise. Finally, due to the extremely complex restructuring which occurred at the Finsider group level, we felt we would be able to more accurately measure the subsidies provided to the producer of the subject merchandise by following the second approach.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Petitioners have argued that the Department should countervail the subsidies emanating from the debt forgiveness provided to Finsider. Petitioners also argue that we should countervail the 99.9 billion lire debt forgiveness provided to TAS as well. However, countervailing both instances of debt forgiveness would overstate the benefit to TAS because we would then be looking at the forgiveness from two different levels of analysis at the same time. As stated in the verification reports, the 99.9 billion debt forgiveness to TAS was part of the larger debt forgiveness provided to Finsider. Therefore, in order to be consistent with the approach chosen in this investigation,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , to focus on the producer of the subject merchandise, we are countervailing only the debt and loss forgiveness provided to TAS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Comment 3  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Petitioners argue that the 300 billion lire payment from IRI to ILVA in 1992 should be countervailed as an equity infusion and not as an interest-free loan. Petitioners maintain that this capital contribution in 1992 was called an ``interest free loan'' because, at that time, it had not been expressly approved as an equity infusion. Also, petitioners point to the fact that there was no loan agreement. Petitioners maintain that the Department should not base its decision on ``technicalities'' such as the EC's delayed approval and the continued absence of a shareholders' decision approving a capital increase. Petitioners conclude that since the Department determined at verification that the EC has recently sanctioned this amount as an equity infusion, the Department should treat it as such.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Petitioners also argue that the 10,900 million lire ``payment on capital account'' to ILVA in 1991, which the Department found at verification, should be countervailed as an equity infusion. The nature of this payment was identical to that of the 1992 payment. Respondents argue that the Department's verification confirmed that this 1992 infusion was a liability as opposed to an equity infusion. Additionally, respondents state that there were two conditions which had to be met before the 1992 capital contribution could be considered an equity infusion: (1) Authorization from the EC; and (2) authorization from the company's shareholder. Neither of these two conditions was met during the POI and the amount was considered a ``provisional capital increase.'' Thus, the Department properly recognized the legal limitations placed on this fund and, treated it as a short-term loan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Respondents state that EC's preliminary approval of the capital contribution in 1993 did not occur until nearly a year and a half after the POI. Citing Countervailing Duty Determinations: Certain Steel Products from France (``Certain Steel from France''), 58 FR 37313 (July 9, 1993), respondents argue that it is the reclassification of debt into equity which itself constitutes the potentially countervailable event in this case. According to respondents, since the potentially countervailable event took place after the POI, it is not subject to analysis in this investigation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> DOC Position  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on an analysis of the primary features of the 1991 and 1992 provisional capital contributions, we find that the potential obligation to repay IRI (in the event that the EC did not approve the capital contribution) effectively makes these contributions contingent liabilities. To reflect their contingent nature, we have modelled the provisional capital contributions as short-term zero-interest loans which are rolled over every six months until such time as they are repaid or the EC approves their conversion to equity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We disagree with respondents that Certain Steel from France is applicable in this instance. In the French case, we were looking at the year the debt-to-equity conversion occurred and decided that the equity infusion was the potentially countervailable event rather than the loan. In this case, the provisional capital increase is being treated as a loan throughout the POI. Therefore, there is no other potentially countervailable event in the POI.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We disagree with petitioners that there must be a loan repayment schedule or payment of interest in order for the Department to consider these payments to represent liabilities. The possibility of repayment was real. Therefore, the provisional capital increase is properly treated as a loan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

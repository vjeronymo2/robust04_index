The deputies, of whom two-thirds were elected under  communist  colours in 1990, accused Shushkevich of contributing to the  collapse of the Soviet Union in December 1991 and of delaying  the return of Belarus to the ruble zone.    The closed-session debate on Shushkevich's future will take  place on Friday, Loiko said.    Shushkevich was elected parliamentary speaker, and thus head  of state, in September 1991, replacing the conservative Nikolay  Dementey who resigned following the failure of a hardline coup  attempt in Moscow the previous month.    Along with the Russian and Ukrainian presidents, Boris  Yeltsin and Leonid Kravchuk, he signed an accord, prepared at  Brest but known as the Minsk Agreement, in December 1991,  declaring the end of the Soviet Union and the creation of the  loosely constituted Commonwealth of Independent States.    The Belarus deputies also discussed the possible dismissal  of  Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich, Interior Minister Vladimir  Yegorov, secret service chief Eduard Shirkovskiy and state  prosecutor Vasiliy Sholodonov, the Baltic News Service reported.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Fu Gang (0265 0474)] </F>   [Text] Wuxi, 31 May (XINHUA) -- At a national work  conference on the technical transformation held here today, Xu  Penghang, vice minister in charge of the State Economic and  Trade Commission, said: The principal problems revealed in  China's economic operations are overinvestment in fixed assets,  conspicuous structural contradictions, outdated equipment in  some state-owned enterprises, backwardness in technology,  single-product production, and weak competitiveness in the  market. To change these conditions, it is necessary to invest  more in the technical transformation in state-owned enterprises,  step up the pace of transformation, and take the road of  developing extended reproduction, on the basis of the existing  scale.    Xu Penghang said: To encourage technical progress in  enterprises, the state has, in the past, implemented a series of  preferential policies for enterprises, like putting fish in a  suitable place to breed, and it has positively promoted  technical progress in enterprises. Under the new circumstances,  however, we can no longer rely on tax breaks and benefits  granted to upgrade technology for enterprises; instead, we  should transform enterprise operating mechanisms, strive to  strengthen their capacity, actively adopt new technologies and  techniques, improve the level of management and overall quality  of enterprises, and practice a system of fair competition to  keep the superior and eliminate the inferior. To this end, the  State Economic and Trade Commission will select a group of  enterprises with favorable conditions to engage in a number of  high-level technical transformation projects, so as to amass the  limited capital to upgrade key industries and enterprises. We  should consider the overall situation in approaching this issue;  while supporting some key state enterprises, we should also  guide the "leading sheep" among collective enterprises, village  and town enterprises, and other economies to cultivate new  economic growth points.    Xu Penghang said: Following the launch of measures for  reforming the financial and taxation, banking, foreign exchange,  and investment systems, the sources of capital for technical  transformations in enterprises have increased, bodies have  cooperated in investing, and the modes of investment have been  diversified. Taking the year 1993 as an example, of the  investments in the state's two technical transformation  projects, each of which was worth hundreds of million of yuan,  only 1.1 percent of the total investment was from the state  budget, 35.5 percent was from domestic loans, 3.8 percent was  from foreign funds, 53.2 percent was from self-raised capital,  and 6.4 percent was from other investments. Capital raised by  enterprises themselves and foreign funds have become an  important source of investment in the technical transformation.  Because the power of examining and approving investment  projects is delegated to the lower authorities, state-owned,  collective, village, and town enterprises and a variety of  economic entities have gradually become investing bodies. As  for the modes of investment, more and more projects are jointly  invested in by the central and local authorities, two or more  localities, governments and enterprises, or enterprises and  foreign businesses.    It has been learned that in the first three years of the  Eighth Five-Year Plan period, China has altogether invested  467.9 billion yuan in the technical transformation, thus  exceeding the total investment in the five years of the Seventh  Five-Year Plan period. Thanks to the state's attention to the  technical transformation in enterprises and investment in energy  resources, undersupplied raw and semifinished materials  industries, transportation, and telecommunications, the  limitations caused by the "bottleneck" industries have been  alleviated to some extent. Meanwhile, the state's vigorous  support of the technical transformation for export-oriented  enterprises engaged in processing industries has increased the  textile industry's foreign exchange earnings by $1 billion; a  significant increase has also been seen in light industry,  electronics, and machine building. In addition, the technical  equipment produced by a number of key industries -- products  such as video recorders, textile machines, air conditioner  compressors, and automobile engines -- have become highly  indigenous, thanks to the import of technologies, the technical  transformation, and technological development.</p>

			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: BEVERLY HILLS;  </P> <P> TEACHER TALKS TO RESUME  </P> <P> Beverly Hills teachers and the school district are scheduled to resume  negotiations today under the direction of a state mediator, with both sides  saying they are willing to go into marathon talks to avoid a strike.  </P> <P> The teachers union has said it will strike Monday if a salary agreement is not  reached. The district has offered a pay raise of 9% over two years; the Beverly  Hills Education Assn., which represents about 300 teachers, wants double that.  </P> <P> Mary Handelsman, a teacher who earns $46,000 after 26 years in the district,  said she is ready to strike.  </P> <P> "I've had students who've gone to Harvard because I told them they can do it,"  she said as she took part in a teachers' protest march Tuesday down Rodeo  Drive. "I'm proud of the work I've done and I think they're proud of me. . . .  The servant is worthy of his hire."  </P> <P> Schools Supt. Robert French earlier declined to comment on the protest but said  he was "still very positive we'll be able to reach a settlement." He has vowed  to keep the schools open if there is a strike and said that almost 200  substitutes have been hired.  </P></p>

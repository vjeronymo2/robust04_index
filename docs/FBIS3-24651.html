			<p>SUMMARY                                 In contrast to their protracted wrangling over the election of  the State Duma's chairman, legislative factions apparently worked  together relatively smoothly in nominating candidates to fill the  positions of the Duma's deputy chairmen and the chairmen and  deputy chairmen of all the committees.  In an apparent effort to  counter fears that the Duma will, like the old Supreme Soviet,  become a bastion of hardline opposition to President Boris  Yeltsin, pro-communist factions evidently made a deliberate  effort to ensure that reformist and centrist party factions would  be well represented among the committee chairmen.  As a result,  the Duma has attained a politically balanced and professionally  competent committee leadership that will make it a far more  credible source of institutional opposition to Yeltsin than the  old Supreme Soviet.                             END SUMMARY      Demonstrating that the competing factions in the new Duma are, so  far, willing and able to work together, at least on  organizationl matters, after two days of closed-door discussions  the Duma's factions reached agreement on a package of nominees  for deputy speakers and the leadership of 23 committees.  The  package distributed the committee assignments about evenly across  the political spectrum, giving each of the major party factions  the leadership of at least one key committee.  The sharing out of  committee positions may have been made easier by the Duma's draft  rules of procedure, which stipulate that the chairman and deputy  chairmen of committees cannot belong to the same faction (See  Note 1).  Once the final package was drawn up, the Duma heard  speeches by eight of the committee chairmen nominees but cut off  further debate and adopted the entire package by a vote of 290 to  63 with 8 abstentions (Interfax, 17 January; Izvestiya, 18  January).      (Note 1) The framers of the package evidently made an exception  for the agriculture and geopolitics committees, however, since  agriculture has a chairman and one deputy from the Agrarian  Party, and geopolitics has a chairman and a deputy from the  Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (Kommersant-Daily, 19  January).      Balancing the Factions      While it seems possible, judging by the success of pro-communist  forces in electing the Duma's chairman, that they could have  imposed their own nominees for most committee heads, they  evidently chose to avoid the risk of an immediate return to the  mutual hostility that characterized relations between Yeltsin and  the old legislature by proposing a provision in the Duma's  temporary rules mandating the "proportional representation" of  factions among the committees (Interfax, 18 January).  The  provision, which the Duma approved, allocated the committee  leadership positions in approximate relation to the numerical  strength of the factions (see box).  According to a deputy from  the Party for Russian Unity and Accord (PRES), an alliance of  centrist and hard-line factions would have been able to keep  reformers out of leadership positions if Duma Chairman Ivan  Rybkin--who the deputy contended wanted to avoid the dominance of  the "anti-presidential opposition" in the Duma--had not proposed  the proportional concept (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 25 January).  The  reformist newspaper Segodnya (26 January), however, credited the  idea to Communist Party (CPRF) leader Gennadiy Zyuganov, who also  reportedly devised a mathematical system for assigning points to  each leadership post, allowing factions to "buy" positions based  on their numerical strength.  According to Segodnya, the Russia's  Choice faction, though numerically greater than the Liberal  Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR), received fewer committee  chairmanships because it used up more "points" to elect faction  member Mikhail Mityukov as the Duma's first deputy chairman.      Press reports have shed little light on the factions'  negotiations, but the negotiators evidently used a variety of  techniques to reach a consensus on the the final list.  They all  reportedly worked together to prevent ultranationalist Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy from heading the important international affairs  committee that he had openly coveted or any other prominent  position in the Duma (Interfax, 14 January; ITAR-TASS, 17  January).  In addition, reformers and pro-communists may have cut  a deal to split two other key committees, defense and security,  between Russia's Choice and the CPRF, respectively.  In some  instances, the negotiators appear to have made an effort to match  committee assignments with deputies' expertise.  In an apparent  effort to satisfy the factions' aspirations to gain a prominent  platform through committee portfolios, several committees were  added, boosting the total number to 23 instead of the 17 agreed  upon by the Yeltsin-appointed commission charged with forming the  Duma's structures (ITAR-TASS, 4 January).  Similarly, the  negotiators added a third deputy chairman position for each  committee, thereby enabling almost one-fourth of the deputies to  attain a "leadership" position (Nezavisimaya' Gazeta, 25 January).      Key Committees      With the exception of the LDPR, which the factions evidently  maneuvered to exclude from prominent committee positions, the  major party factions each got the chairmanship of at least one  key committee.  Before the factions met, the CPRF was reportedly  angling for both the defense and security portfolios  (Interfax,  5 January), but in the end, it won only the security  chairmanship.  For its part, the Agrarian Party gained the  chairmanship of the important judicial and legal reform  committee.      Defense.  Despite holding the military rank of colonel, committee  chairman Sergey Yushenkov, a Russia's Choice member, appears to  have limited experience in military matters.  The Defense  Ministry reportedly regards committee deputy chairman Aleksandr  Piskunov, a member of the New Regional Policy group of non-party  deputies, as "more sophisticated in military matters" than  Yushenkov (Krasnaya Zvezda, 25 January; Kommersant-Daily, 27  January).  Piskunov was deputy chairman of the former Supreme  Soviet's defense and security committee.      Security.  The CPRF's Viktor Ilyukhin, a former USSR deputy  prosecutor general who once attempted to have ex-President  Mikhail Gorbachev tried for treason for his role in the  dissolution of the USSR, became head of the security committee  (ITAR-TASS, 17 January).  Citing an unidentified source in the  Federal Counterintelligence Service, Kommersant-Daily (27  January) reported that the service regards Ilyukhin as "a man  with whom one can talk," in part because of his reported  commitment to strong, centralized security bodies.  His committee  also includes such hardline nationalist figures as television  anchorman Aleksandr Nevzorov and Yuriy Vlasov (Kommersant-Daily,  27 January).      International Affairs.  The choice of former Ambassador to the  United States Vladimir Lukin, a member of the Yavlinskiy bloc, to  head the international relations committee most likely satisfies  hardliners' minimum aims to bring a less Western-oriented point  of view to foreign policy while simultaneously assuring reformers  that the committee is not likely to be extremist in its views.  Before his appointment as ambassador, Lukin chaired the Supreme  Soviet's international affairs committee.  Although it is not  clear if the CPRF had its own candidate for this post, Russia's  Choice reportedly was prepared to back either Lukin or former  First Deputy Foreign Minister Anatoliy Adamishin (also a member  of the Yavlinskiy bloc), and the two sides evidently cooperated  to find a mutually acceptable candidate to prevent Zhirinovskiy  from heading the committee (Interfax, 14, 17 January; AFP, 17  January).  As a PRES deputy observed, "Communists and Agrarians  do not want the complete discreditation of the Duma"  (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 25 January), and the selection of  Zhirinovskiy would have led to polarized relations with the  executive and made the committee a less credible instrument in  the opposition's struggle against Yeltsin's pro-Western foreign  policy.  Nevertheless, the LDPR's Aleksey Mitrofanov, who holds  the foreign ministry portfolio in the LDPR's "shadow cabinet,"  was elected as a deputy chairman (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 30 November  1993).      Legislation, Judicial, and Legal Reform.  The selection of the  Agrarian Party's Vladimir Isakov, a determined advocate of strong  powers for the legislature, to head this committee places him in  a position to assert the legislature's interests on major  political reform issues.  The committee is responsible for the  preliminary examination of all draft legislation on the judicial  system and on the civil and criminal codes, as well as all  "federal constitutional laws"--approximately a dozen key laws  governing presidential and parliamentary elections, the  procedures for forming the Federation Council in the future, the  holding of referenda, and the specific powers of and  interrelationship among the president, the Government, the  Federal Assembly, and the constitutional court (Rossiyskaya  Gazeta, 27 January).  Isakov, who headed the Supreme Soviet's  Committee for Constitutional Legislation and spearheaded many of  that body's attempts to limit Yeltsin's presidential powers and  had expressed early interest in heading this committee, is likely  to continue to push for amendments to the constitution, which he  says contains "inherent contradictions" between the executive and  legislative branch, though the constitution outlines a very  difficult and cumbersome amendment process (Interfax, 5 January;  RIA, 25 January).  Any anti-presidential initiatives by Isakov  will be opposed by reformers on the committee, including deputy  chairman and Russia's Choice member Boris Zolotukhin, the  experienced legislator Viktor Sheynis (Yavlinskiy bloc), and  Vladimir Tumanov, a PRES deputy and legal specialist at the  Russian Academy of Sciences Institute of State and Law  (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 5 February).      Proliferation of Committees      In the original list of 17 committees, only one oversaw foreign  policy issues, but the final list added one for relations with  the CIS, headed by PRES deputy Konstantin Zatulin, and one on  "geopolitics," headed by the LDPR's Viktor Ustinov and staffed  predominantly by other LDPR members (ITAR-TASS, 4 January, 20  January).  The presence of three committees overseeing foreign  policy--in addition to the security and defense committees--will  probably complicate the Duma's handling of foreign policy issues,  especially toward the CIS, and, as Nezavisimaya Gazeta's foreign  desk editor Mikhail Karpov suggested, may allow Yeltsin and  Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev to exploit differences among  these committees (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 19 January).      Geopolitics.  According to Russia's Choice member Arkadiy  Murashev, the creation of the geopolitics committee was a  concession to the LDPR after the factions successfully kept  Zhirinovskiy off the international affairs committee (Interfax,  17 January).  Even here, however, the negotiators denied  Zhirinovskiy the chairmanship, choosing instead the LDPR's Viktor  Ustinov to head it.  Of the committee's 14 members, nine are from  the LDPR faction (Rossiya, No. 5, 2-8 February).      CIS Relations.  As a businessman who attempted to unite Russian  entrepreneurs and enterprise directors in his association,  Entrepreneurs for a New Russia (Moskovskiye Novosti, No. 31, 1  August 1993; ITAR-TASS, 7 September 1993), Zatulin appears to  have a vested interest in promoting close relations with CIS  member states as a way of restoring the economic ties that bound  the former USSR republics together.  He has stated that PRES  supports the "reorientation" of foreign policy "toward the near  abroad [CIS member states] and the creation of a confederation  within the CIS framework" (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 11 January).      Information Policy.  Russia's Choice became another beneficiary  in the committee proliferation game when the negotiators agreed  to create a new committee on the media and nominated Russia's  Choice member and former media tsar Mikhail Poltoranin to head  it.  The new Committee on Information Policy and Communications  also has ample representation of opposition figures among its  deputy chairmen: Gennadiy Seleznev, a CPRF member and former  chief editor of Pravda; Oleg Finko, an LDPR member and chief  editor of the legal newspaper Yuridicheskaya Gazeta; and Igor  Klochkov, an Agrarian Party member and former chairman of the  traditionalist Federation of Independent Trade Unions of Russia  (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 26 January).      Ethnic Policy.  This committee, which was not on the original  list of committees, appears to have been added as a concession to  the New Regional Policy group of non-party deputies, whose  member, Bair Zhamsuyev, was selected to head it.  Zhamsuyev was  elected to the Duma as a non-party candidate from the Aga-Buryat  autonomous okrug (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 28 December 1993).      Economic Committees      The failure of Russia's Choice to receive the top post in any of  the three committees concerned with economic matters is a setback  for the faction and reflects continuing fractiousness among  reformers, who reportedly failed once again to unite against the  more organized opposition, particularly the CPRF and Agrarian  Party (Kommersant-Daily, 19 January).  Both the proposed and  final list included three economic committees, but the final list  realigned the committees' responsibilities somewhat, creating  overlaps in important areas that may hamper the adoption of  economic legislation.      Budget, Taxation, Banking, and Finance.  This committee--the  largest by a wide margin with 43 members (Rossiya, No. 5, 2-8  February)--is headed by Mikhail Zadornov, a member of the  moderate reformist Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin bloc and a former  associate at Grigoriy Yavlinskiy's Economic and Political  Research Center (Moskovskiye Novosti, No. 20, 19 May 1991;  Krasnaya Zvezda, 25 January).  According to Interfax (16  January), Russia's Choice proposed Aleksandr Pochinok, who was  chairman of the analogous committee in the Supreme Soviet--to  head this committee but was willing to compromise on Zadornov,  with Pochinok ending up as one of the committee's deputy chairmen  (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 26 January).  While the original list  proposed one committee for budget and taxes and another for  banking, finance, and monetary policy, the faction negotiators  apparently decided to combine fiscal and monetary oversight  functions, greatly expanding the committee's purview.  In a major  win for reformers, ex-Finance Minister Boris Fedorov was elected  to head the subcommittee on credit and monetary policy, giving  him an official role in overseeing Central Bank policy, which he  has vociferously criticized (Radio Rossii, 8 February).  Many  committee members are reportedly former directors of small  enterprises, trading firms, commercial banks, or private  investment funds rather than economists, leading Krasnaya  Zvezda's parliamentary reporter Vladimir Yermolin to conclude  that the committee will divide between private and corporate  interests rather than between monetarists and industrialists (25  January).      Property, Privatization, and Economic Activity.  In a major boost  for the New Regional Policy group of non-party deputies--which is  second in numerical strength after Russia's Choice--one of their  members, Sergey Burkov, was chosen to head this important  committee.  Burkov was elected without party affiliation from a  single-seat constituency in Kemerovo Oblast, where he served as  adviser on economic matters to the oblast soviet (Rossiyskaya  Gazeta, 28 December 1993).  As committee chairman, Burkov will be  in a position to defend regional interests as the focus of  privatization shifts toward the regions.      Economic Policy.  As with the choice of Lukin for the  international affairs committee, the selection of Sergey Glazyev,  a member of the centrist Democratic Party of Russia (DPR) and  former minister for foreign economic relations, appears to  reflect a conscious decision by faction negotiators to find a  mutually acceptable candidate to head this broadly mandated  committee.  With only 15 members in its faction (ITAR-TASS, 19  January), the DPR may not otherwise have been a contender to  chair such an important committee.  The committee itself was  added to the original list, which had given responsibility for  overall economic reform to the property and privatization  committee (ITAR-TASS, 4 January).  Glazyev has indicated a  preference for a more moderate reform course, saying that he  would like to stimulate production by reducing the "excessive tax  burden" currently imposed on enterprises (Segodnya, 3 February).  He is reportedly planning to present to the Duma an economic  program that calls for price controls and "temporary" wage  freezes and would reassert state management over certain sectors  while also reserving for the state "veto power" over shareholder  decisions in the case of large industrial enterprises undergoing  privatization (Segodnya, 8 February).      Party and Professional Expertise      Several of the committee chairmanships appear to have gone to the  factions with a strong vested interest in the subject matter,  perhaps as a result of these factions' bidding under Zyuganov's  "points" system.  For example, members of PRES, which billed  itself as the "party of the regions" during the election  campaign, head the Committee on Local Self-Government and the  Committee on Federation Affairs and Regional Policy.  The latter  committee's functions may overlap with those of the Committee on  Ethnic Policy.  The Committee on Agricultural Issues is headed by  a member of the Agrarian Party faction, and 19 of its 27 members  are also from the Agrarian faction (Rossiya, No. 5, 2-8  February).  Likewise, the Women of Russia faction, whose election  campaign focused on the need to protect women and families from  the adverse impact of economic reforms, heads the Committee for  Women, Family, and Youth.      For some of the less high-profile committees, the factions appear  to have tried to match committee chairmanships with the  professional expertise of individual deputies.  For example,  Bella Denisenko, a Russia's Choice member and former first deputy  minister of health, heads the Committee on Health.  She also  served on the former Supreme Soviet's Committee for Public  Health, Social Insurance, and Physical Culture and even resigned  her government position to retain her committee position after  the Supreme Soviet passed a law preventing government members  from serving simultaneously in the legislature (ITAR-TASS, 18  December 1992; Kuranty, 13 February 1993).      Similarly, the LDPR's Mikhail Lemeshev, who heads the Ecology  Committee, is a long-time environmental activist whose interest  in environmental protection appears to have led him to embrace  the nationalist cause.  He has held a number of environmental  posts, including as an "expert" with the UN, and was once a  member of the governing board of the Committee To Save the Volga  (Podmoskovye, No. 17, 27 April 1991; Rabochaya Tribuna, 31  October 1991).  Lemeshev also served as president of the USSR  Anti-Nuclear Society, in which capacity he advocated energy  conservation--in part through higher energy prices--as an  alternative to nuclear energy (Svet (Priroda i Chelovek), No. 3,  March 1991).  Like other nationalists, Lemeshev has condemned  overreliance on the export of natural resources to earn hard  currency and the exploitation of Russian oil fields by Western  companies (Podmoskovye, No. 17, 27 April 1991).      Mixed Views on Compromise Process      Deputies from various factions across the spectrum have praised  the decision to draw up a package of candidates for a single vote  as a way of streamlining what might otherwise have been a  protracted, contentious process.  The Agrarian Party's Isakov  said that the package vote was a "reasonable" compromise that  made it possible "to avoid wasting weeks on voting on  appointments," while Vyacheslav Shostakovskiy of the Yavlinskiy  bloc succinctly termed it an "achievement" (ITAR-TASS, 20  January).  Even PRES chairman Sergey Shakhray, who initially  opposed the negotiations and package vote, said that ultimately  the process was beneficial: "Had we nominated heads of  parliamentary committees person by person, the political spectrum  would have been more uniform, and the factor of professional  qualification for the post would not have been always taken into  account" (Interfax, 17 January; Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 25 January).      Other deputies, however, particularly those not affiliated with a  faction, complained that the factions' closed-door negotiations  did not take into account the interests of non-party deputies and  expressed concern that factions are playing a disproportionate  role in the Duma's decisionmaking.  However, because here are no  more than 58 unaffiliated deputies in the Duma, their voice is  likely to go unheeded by the factions:      --  Commenting on the factions' compromise, Vasiliy Lipitskiy,  who heads the non-parliamentary People's Party of Free Russia but  was elected as an unaffiliated deputy from a single-seat  constituency, complained that the Duma "vacillates between utter  uncontrollability and too rigidly controlled decision-making by  the heads of groups [factions]" (ITAR-TASS, 20 January).      --  Similarly, deputies who have affiliated with the Union of 12  December group, started by Economic Freedom Party leader Irina  Khakamada, and Sergey Baburin's nationalist Russian Way group-  -neither of which has yet gained enough members to register as a  faction--expressed pique that their groups were slighted in the  negotiations, with the Russian Way calling the package vote a  "black day for Russian patriots" (Segodnya, 26 January).      Implications      By reaching a consensus relatively quickly on the distribution of  committee assignments, factions demonstrated their ability to  overcome significant party differences, negotiate, and  compromise.  Deputies may in the future try to use package votes  like the kind successfully employed in this case as one tool of  compromise, though it will be more difficult to apply this  technique to substantive issues like legislation.  The factions'  negotiations also indicate that they are likely to play a  dominant role in the Duma, possibly making it a more disciplined  and less capricious body than the former Supreme Soviet.      By agreeing on compromise candidates for some committees and  distributing key committees among the major factions, the pro-  communist opposition successfully pursued what appears to have  been a deliberate tactic not to provoke an immediate  confrontation with Yeltsin.  Having sought an organizational  structure that is not overwhelmingly dominated by their own  members, Yeltsin's opponents in the Duma appear intent on making  the legislature become a more credible, and therefore more  effective, institution than the former Supreme Soviet, thus  increasing pressure on Yeltsin to take its views into account.

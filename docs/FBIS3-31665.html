"This shows once more that there are forces in  the Republic of Moldova which resort in their actions to forms  of intoxication, trying to bring Romania and the Republic of  Moldova at loggerheads. We must avoid falling into provocation  snares, we must act with calm and have in view the particular  circumstances of the election campaign," Chebeleu said.  (Sangheli alleged recently that, by some of its statements, the  Romanian Ministry of Foreign affairs had interfered in the  internal affairs of the Republic of Moldova).    As for a possible change of Romania's policy in its  relations  with Chisinau, spokesman Chebeleu said that "Bucharest's policy  is not circumstantial, it aims at developing long-term  relations, as a constant of our foreign policy."    In a different line of thought, Traian Chebeleu, speaking of  the intervention of the Russian Federation in the Yugoslav  crisis, said that "any intervention is welcome if its purpose is  to pacify and to help the political settlement of the conflict.  In this respect, the intervention of the Russian Federation and  its acceptance by the Serbian authorities of Bosnia is a  positive contribution to the reinstatement of a peaceful  climate."</p>

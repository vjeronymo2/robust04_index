			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Three hanged in Kabul Afghanistan's government hanged three men yesterday in front of a crowd of thousands in its most dramatic implementation of Islamic law since it came to power in April, Reuter reports from Kabul. Mr Yunis Qanuny, the defence ministry spokesman, said the men had confessed to murder, looting and robbery before a special court to which there was no public access. Their deaths were a necessary example to others as the four-month-old mujahideen government tried to restore order in the capital after weeks of bloody factional fighting, he said.</p>

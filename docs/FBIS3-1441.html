It has become  increasingly difficult to know what is going on in Lusaka  because the information blackout [preceding word in English] has  become more rigorous. Information from diplomatic sources reveal  the mediator could ask the parties to bypass the discussions on  the country's administration to the last point which is  connected with elections. According to such sources, only after  the conclusion of these discussions, would the parties resume  discussions on the important point of the country's  administration, within the framework of national reconciliation.  Malian-born mediator Alioune Blondin Beye renewed his appeal to  the negotiating parties to achieve a lasting peace as soon as  possible.</p>

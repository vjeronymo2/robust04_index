			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / People: Peripatetic Perkins picks publisher The explosion of interest in new media is encouraging some interesting excursions across traditional boundaries. Fred Perkins, former head of the Financial Times electronic information services, has been appointed group vice-president for the McGraw-Hill Book Company, based in Maidenhead, near London. His responsibilities will cover Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Perkins' experience of on-line information goes back more than two decades but this is his first experience of management in the world of traditional book publishing: 'I believe McGraw-Hill wanted somebody who is aware of the publishing world but who comes from outside it,' Perkins says, adding that the company is a combination of state of the art innovator and established business. McGraw Hill, founded in 1888 with sales last year of around Dollars 2bn, is already experimenting with new media forms - it publishes its entire book catalogue on CD-ROM. Another trial involves allowing college teachers to pick and mix sections from McGraw-Hill textbooks to create material tailored to each course, the idea being to render illegal photocopying unnecessary. Perkins, 46, studied electrical and electronic engineering at the universities of Strathclyde and Glasgow and carried on to an MSc at Sussex and research in medical electronics at Dundee. He worked for Citibank, ICL and IP Sharp (now part of Reuters) before the FT, where he led the successful campaign to convince the Monopolies and Mergers Commission that FT Profile's licensing practices were not against the public interest. Although his old company and his new are aiming at the same markets, he does not rule out the possibility of collaboration as the multimedia revolution redraws the boundaries of competition.</p>

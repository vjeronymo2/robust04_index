			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Net assets up at Fidelity Euro Total net assets at Fidelity European Values stood at Pounds 69.6m at end-December, a 62 per cent rise from the Pounds 43m reported at the previous year end; net asset value rose from 103.54p to 167.49p per share. Dividend income was ahead at Pounds 1.68m (Pounds 1.36m), but a cut in deposit interest earnings from Pounds 569,000 to Pounds 115,000 meant revenue after tax was reduced from Pounds 203,000 to Pounds 133,000, reducing earnings per share to 0.32p (0.49p). No final dividend is recommended, leaving a total maintained at 0.3p.</p>

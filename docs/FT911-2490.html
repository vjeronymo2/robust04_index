			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / UK Company News: Fisons division moves into Europe with Pounds 10m buy FISONS, the pharmaceutical, scientific equipment and horticulture group, has bought the horticultural business of DSM, the Dutch chemical company, for Pounds 10m cash. The business, DSM Agro Specialties, includes a variety of marketing and production units in the Netherlands and Belgium. Combined sales are believed to about Pounds 10m ayear withoperating profits of Pounds 1m a year. The acquisition will increasethe size of Fisons Horticulture, the smallest of the group's three divisions, by about 10 per cent and will take it into new geographical territory. At present it operates mainly in the UK and North America. Apart from a small operation in France, it has not been represented in continental Europe. The deal represents something of a change of heart by Fisons, which used to have a 50 per cent stake in Asef, part of DSM Agro Specialties. Fisons sold out to DSM in December 1988. Asef is the leader in the Dutch amateur gardening market. DSM Agro Specialties includes other professional and amateur horticulture businesses and a liquid fertiliser plant at Geleen in the Netherlands.</p>

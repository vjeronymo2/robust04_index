			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / BR introduces quality rules for its suppliers BRITISH RAIL yesterday introduced rules to govern its relations with suppliers that provide it with Pounds 1.5bn of goods and services every year. At a meeting with 270 of its largest suppliers in Birmingham Mr Peter Watson, the board member responsible for engineering, outlined a system of qualification and accreditation that each company will have to undertake if it is to remain a BR supplier. The aim is to raise the standard of service and to improve the quality of products BR buys, as part of a programme to boost the confidence of BR's own customers. BR is going down the same route as the automotive industry, where car manufacturers have produced lists of preferred suppliers with which they are prepared to work on a long-term basis. Mr Watson said the government's plans for privatisation would have no impact on the process. He added that the step was 'better late than never'. BR's new policy towards its suppliers will be introduced in two stages. From January next year no company will be able to tender for a supply contract unless it can meet minimum standards. Also starting next year, BR will introduce accreditation awards for its main suppliers. BR's main suppliers include GEC Alsthom, Brel and Brush for rolling stock; ABB and Westinghouse for signalling equipment; and British Steel, Pandrol and Costain for track. Operating losses at London Transport increased from Pounds 108m to Pounds 123m in the year to March 31 because of a fall in the number of passengers.</p>

			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Shares in Northern Foods jump after strong result SHARES in Northern Foods, the dairy, convenience food, meat and grocery group, jumped 14p to 605p yesterday as the group announced a 19.7 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 126.2m in spite of a competitive market. Mr Chris Haskins, chairman, said the figures represented 'excellent progress'. He said pressure from food retailers had made the industry very competitive, but Northern had seen good sales growth from its four main customers, Marks and Spencer, J. Sainsbury, Tesco and Safeway. These four account for nearly 40 per cent of group sales which were 21.7 per cent higher at Pounds 1.4bn. Mr Haskins said sales were running ahead of budget so far in the current year but this had been achieved by giving up some margin. He expected profits to accelerate through the year, as benefits from rationalisation and capital expenditure came through. Several acquisitions helped boost profits, although the largest, the Pounds 326m purchase of Express Dairies and Eden Vale from Grand Metropolitan, was completed only two months before the financial year ended in March. Acquisitions made since April 1990 contributed Pounds 9.5m after financing costs. Operating profits rose 10 per cent excluding acquisitions. Finance charges rose from Pounds 3.5m to Pounds 7.8m as the impact of higher borrowings began to be felt. Profit-sharing took Pounds 3.5m, against Pounds 2.7m last time. Earnings per share were 16.8 per cent higher at 38.31p, (against 32.79p last time, after adjusting for the rights issue). A final dividend of 9.27p is proposed, to give a total of 15.75p, a rise of 14.8 per cent on the previous year's 13.72p adjusted for the rights. Mr Haskins said the planned abolition of the Milk Marketing Board in 1994 should be positive for the group. It aimed to buy milk directly from farmers and believed it would be more efficient than the MMB. The current pricing system for milk, with prices depending on the end use of the milk, meant Northern paid a substantial premium, of about 2p a litre, for its milk. This cost the group about Pounds 40m a year, he said. Mr Haskins said that when he started in the industry in 1962 the price of a pint of milk, a standard loaf of bread and a pint of beer was about the same. The pint of milk was now the cheapest, which he said showed it was the most efficient of the three industries. Details, Page 26 Lex, Page 22</p>

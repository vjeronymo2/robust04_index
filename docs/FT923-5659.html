			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / French doubts on Maastricht grow OPPOSITION to the Maastricht treaty on European union is continuing to grow in France despite the government's campaign efforts. The latest opinion poll shows that 53 per cent of those polled plan to vote against ratifying the treaty in next month's referendum. The poll, compiled by CSA for Le Parisien newspaper, is the third this week indicating a majority may vote No in the September 20 referendum. Two previous polls showed majorities of 51 per cent and 52 per cent against Maastricht. Three other polls published this week suggested small majorities in favour of the treaty. Support for Maastricht has been falling since President Francois Mitterrand announced the referendum in June, fuelling fears throughout the EC that the French will reject it. This depressed Europe's stock markets throughout the week. The leaders of one of the two main right-wing opposition parties, Mr Jacques Chirac of the RPR, has since joined his rival, Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing of the UDF, in the pro-Maastricht lobby. He was previously reluctant to do so because of concern about splits in his own party on Europe. The RPR, which has a 75 per cent majority against Maastricht, yesterday announced it would be dividing its allocation of broadcast airtime between the Yes and No factions when the official pre-referendum campaign starts on September 7. The only consolation for the pro-Maastricht campaigners from yesterday's poll was that a high proportion of the CSA sample - 40 per cent - had still not decided which way to vote in the referendum, or whether to vote at all.

			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Dismay over chip share in Japan US semiconductor industry and trade officials yesterday expressed dismay at a fall in the foreign share of Japan's semiconductor market below the 20 per cent annual target level which Washington has laid so much store by. 'We are extremely concerned about this negative trend in the market share,' Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, said. His remarks came after the two governments released the foreign share of Japan's semiconductor market in the second quarter of this year. The US calculations showed a fall to 19.2 per cent. The second-quarter figure represents a decline of 1 percentage point from the 20.2 per cent market share taken by US and other foreign companies in the fourth quarter of 1993 and follows a decline to 19.6 per cent in the first quarter of this year. Japanese officials, however, use a different calculating method which showed the foreign share to be at 21.6 per cent. Mr Andrew A Procassini, president of the US Semiconductor Industry Association, reacted to the results with strong words. 'Japan's commitment to create a more open semiconductor market remains unfulfilled,' Mr Procassini said. But Japanese officials expressed satisfaction with the results which show that 'access to the Japanese semiconductor market has improved,' said Mr Hidehiko Yoshida, senior vice president of Toshiba and chairman of the Users Committee of Foreign Semiconductors of the Electronics Industry Association of Japan. In the fourth quarter of 1992, the foreign share surged to 20.2 per cent from 15.9 per cent in the third quarter, leading US trade officials to hail the US-Japan semiconductor accord as a model which could be adopted in other sectors.</p>

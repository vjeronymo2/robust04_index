			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / Motoring: For the super-charged family Mazda's 626 D-CX five-door hatchback is the first super-charged, as distinct from turbo-charged, diesel car to reach Britain, writes Stuart Marshall. The air pump that improves performance is driven directly from the two-litre engine, not by a turbine in the exhaust gas stream. As a result, instant boost is available at low engine speeds. The power-steered 626 D-CX drives with close to a petrol car's refinement and liveliness, has anti-lock brakes, a sweet five-speed gearbox, and gives more than 40 miles a gallon (6.89 l/100km). At Pounds 13,395 - which includes electric windows, door mirrors, and aerial for the six-speaker audio system - I rate this comfortable, well equipped, family-size car an attractive buy.</p>

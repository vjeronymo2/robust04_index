			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>   [Text] Moscow February 10 TASS -- Chairman of the Russian  State Duma Ivan Rybkin said that by participating in the  December 1993 elections the deputies admitted the  constitutionality of the presidential decision to disband the  former parliament.    Speaking at a news conference in Moscow on Thursday [10  February], Rybkin said that he did not see any sin in the  establishment of a commission to investigate into the October  1993 revolt in Moscow, making it clear that whatever the  findings they will be of no more than academic value.    The news conference was held in a peaceful atmosphere. The  Duma chairman tried to smooth out sharp issues and stick to the  constructive-reconciliatory tone which he has assumed from the  day of his election.    He spoke about good cooperation between the Duma and the  president, the government and the Federation Council and denied  statements that he was seeking to subjugate the whole house and  receive unlimited powers similar to those of his predecessor,  Ruslan Khasbulatov.    Asked about the attitude of the Duma towards and his own  position on the trial of scientist Vil Mirzayanov accused of  betraying state secrets about chemical weapons, Rybkin replied  that the Duma human rights committee is now considering this  issue.    Speaking about the situation in connection with the upcoming  local elections, he described it as rather complicated, adding  that the State Duma's position is "very delicate." "We can  determine the basic principles of the electoral laws for the  subjects of the Federation, but we do not want to impose  anything on anyone," Rybkin said.    He opposed calls for revising the constitution, saying that  "since it is adopted, we, as loyal citizens, should abide by  it." He stressed, however, that amendments can be adopted  because the constitution has many flaws.    Commenting on the situation in agriculture, Rybkin admitted  that often huge state subsidies to the agro-industrial complex  were ineffective. But now subsidies should be targeted. "Those  who are ripe for bankruptcy, should be declared bankrupt," he  said.    Speaking about foreign debts, Rybkin stressed that Russia is  owed 1.5 times more than it owes others. This question has been  ignored for a long time in the government, he added. Rybkin  suggested selling other countries's debts to Russia at 65-80 per  cent of their nominal value.</p>

			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / Tangled mesh of corporate debt ties down Russia's economy: How powerful enterprises are protecting themselves from the harsh realities of the market Like the sorcerer's apprentice, thousands of Russian enterprises have been furiously churning out goods they are unable to sell and taking delivery of goods they cannot pay for. This absurd practice has built up, by conservative estimates, a Rbs30 thousand billion mountain of inter-enterprise debt which presents so serious a threat to the Russian economy that an 'emergency commission' established last week to address the issue has been reporting weekly to the president and prime minister. 'This problem is a very big and complex issue which it is difficult for a person from a normal country to understand,' explains Mr Peter Karpov, deputy director of Russia's federal bankruptcy agency. 'It is a product of our old system in which goods were traded according to a central plan, and money was like an amusing but insignificant little musical accompaniment.' The convoluted web of inter-enterprise debt is now threatening to paralyse the Russian economy. Workers at the Smolensk nuclear power plant yesterday continued their two-week-old strike, sparked by the power station's failure to pay wages for the past four months, which in turn has been caused by the Russian power grid's failure to pay the Rbs5.5bn it owes the plant. Thousands of workers in less vital and potentially volatile industries have also been hit by the payments crisis. But to untangle the massive network of debt the government will have to take a fundamental, and potentially painful, decision about Russia's economic future. The debt issue is the first and most fundamental test of the Russian government's commitment to economic reforms since this spring, when Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, impressed western financial institutions and halted the country's runaway inflation by introducing tighter fiscal and monetary policies. Gone were the soft credits which insulated many enterprises from the harsh realities of the market in the first few years after the collapse of communist central planning. However, thousands of factory directors have found a way to evade the government's new austerity. They have continued to operate in their habitual, inefficient fashion, but have stopped paying their suppliers and their employees. In turn, their purchasers have stopped paying them. 'As one of the most powerful classes in Russia, the directors have a strong corporate mentality, and by not paying one another and accumulating huge debts they are protecting themselves from market reforms,' says Mr Dmitri Vasiliev, deputy head of the state privatisation agency and a leading market reformer. 'Their position today is simple: they are going to the government and, as always, asking for fresh credits to liberate them from the payments crisis.' A more nefarious motivation for the accumulation of inter- enterprise debt is suggested in a document circulating within the Russian government and obtained by the Financial Times. Based on an investigation of 15 companies, the report, written by the bankruptcy agency's Mr Karpov, argues that corruption, in the form of bribes given to factory managers to induce them to ship goods for which their enterprises are unlikely to ever be paid, is the principal source of mounting inter-enterprise debt. The report accuses specific companies, among them the Yaroslavnefteorgsintez oil refinery in central Russia, which has arrears of Rbs375bn, of receiving 'invisible commissions' from their debtors. In person, Mr Karpov is even more blunt. 'There's a criminal element involved. Imagine I want to buy some oil from you on credit. You say fine. Then I lay some cash on the table and I'm happy and you're happy but the enterprise has an unpaid debt.' Mr Karpov maintains that about a thousand large enterprises, most of them in sectors with the ability to export, engage in these sorts of practices and bear the lion's share of the blame for the debt crisis. When these giants fail to pay their own suppliers 'the creditors are either too embarrassed to say anything or too scared. They realise that if they complain too loudly they could wind up with bullets in their foreheads.' In his report Mr Karpov concludes that, as the non-payments crisis mounts, indebted enterprises are trying to portray themselves as 'innocent and noble producers, victims of the arrears crisis, while the facts and scale of their immoral business are carefully concealed'. As reformers in the government concede, these indebted enterprises form a powerful lobby which is pushing for an old-style solution: lower taxes, easy credits and perhaps a freeze on some prices. If the government manages to stand up to the directors and take the option preferred by market reformers  -to force them into bankruptcy - it would be the clearest sign yet that Russia is committed to building capitalism.</p>

			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / UK Company News: EFG benefits from cost reductions EFG, the garden leisure and horticultural group, made pre-tax profits of Pounds 29,000 in the 27 weeks to August 2, compared with losses of Pounds 2.07m for 26 weeks last time. However, relatively low seasonal activity in the second half was likely to lead to 'a not insignificant loss' for the full year. Last year the deficit was Pounds 3.06m. Directors believed the capital base required strengthening and gearing needed reducing. Various options were being reviewed for raising additional capital from existing shareholders and possibly from a third party. Turnover dropped from Pounds 20.2m to Pounds 12.7m. Extraordinary debits of Pounds 1.22m left the net attributable deficit at Pounds 1.19m (Pounds 2.08m). The extraordinaries included a Pounds 1m provision for withdrawing from landscape contracting. Earnings per share were 0.19p (losses 12.55p).</p>

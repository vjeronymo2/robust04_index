			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Yorkshire and Tyne Tees agree TV merger: Deal to create third-largest independent TV company seen as forerunner to industry consolidation YORKSHIRE Television and Tyne Tees Television, two northern England companies that won independent television franchises last year, yesterday announced terms of a merger. A recommended offer from Yorkshire values the Tyne Tees share capital at Pounds 30.4m and the deal has been approved in principle by the Independent Television Commission. Such mergers were not expected until after the ITC's formal moratorium on non-recommended bids was lifted in January 1994. But yesterday's deal is seen as a forerunner of the consolidation likely to occur among the companies that won franchises last year. At Westminster, Mr Robert Maclennan, Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, urged the government to review the Broadcasting Act with a view to tightening ownership rules. 'When the Broadcasting Act went through parliament, the then minister in charge, David Mellor, argued strongly against a regional ITV company taking over a neighbouring TV company,' he said. He predicted the merger would 'destabilise' ITV 'as larger groups are formed to compete effectively for advertising'. Yorkshire and Tyne Tees were among the highest bidders for franchises last year and put their finances under some strain, analysts say. The merger would make the combined group the third-largest independent television company behind Thames and Central. The all-share offer involves 17 new Yorkshire shares for every 10 Tyne Tees shares, valuing each at 292p. Yorkshire last year bought a 20 per cent stake in Tyne Tees. Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, owns 20 per cent of Yorkshire. Yorkshire shareholders will be entitled to a bonus issue of warrants allowing them to subscribe to Yorkshire shares which, if fully taken up, would raise Pounds 20m for the combined company. Mr Clive Leach, Yorkshire chief executive, said the combined group would have 16 per cent of the ITV audience but 12 per cent of its advertising revenues. 'Yorkshire's position is undoubtedly relatively improved and it goes some way to redress the imbalance with companies that got their franchises on comparatively cheaper terms,' one analyst said.

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Mobilization for National Development, MDN, the  party of professor Hubert de Ronceray, accuses the UN and the  OAS of converting themselves into inquisition courts to crucify  the poorest nation of the American continent. Within the next  hours or coming days, the giants will add new cruelties to the  Haitian age-old tragedy, states MDN leader Hubert De Ronceray.    [Begin De Ronceray recording] In spite of our 191 years of  struggle against all the weariness of chronic underdevelopment,  today, we are more isolated than ever in a hostile, merciless  world. Our loneliness is aggravated by our noxious sense of  identity, our indiscipline, our intolerance, and the  pathological ambitions of our irreconcilable camps. In the  coming hours or days, the giants will add new cruelties to our  age-old tragedy to again remind us that human rights, stated in  the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in the Constitution of  the United States, and in all the world's charters, do not apply  to the negroes of Haiti.    In the name of democracy, Haitians have no right to work, to  travel, to feed themselves, to use the fruits of their labor, to  receive medical care, etc.    All it takes now is to brandish the word democracy in order  to assassinate Haiti and its people without impunity, and to  justify the daily murder of thousands of children and young  people, victims of an absurd, criminal embargo.    The misfortunes that are hitting us today could have been  avoided if there had been, outside and inside, a minimum of  respect for a spark of truth. Our fundamental charter forces us  to resist all partial or total occupation of the national  territory, to avoid satisfying individual madness linked to some  brotherhood or hierarchy, but to assert our rights as a  sovereign people and our determination to choose a democracy  authentically Haitian, respectful of our laws, of our  institutions, and of our cultural identity.    More hardships are ahead of us. But tomorrow will consist of  a Haitian political solution that will bring about national and  international reconciliation. [end recording]</p>

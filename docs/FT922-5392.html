			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Southnews Pounds 0.9m back in the black SHARES OF Southnews, the USM-quoted London regional newspaper publisher, rose 10p to 104p yesterday on news of a swing from losses of Pounds 987,000 to profits of Pounds 899,000 pre-tax for the year to March 28. The 1990 losses were struck after taking account of exceptional reorganisation costs of Pounds 916,000. Turnover fell from Pounds 16.4m to Pounds 14.1m. The directors said the 'recruitment' category of the advertising business accounted for 70 per cent of the decline. Earnings emerged at 3.93p (losses 5.24p). A final dividend of 1p makes a 1.5p (0.8p) total. Year-end gearing was cut from 71 per cent to 17 per cent and the balance sheet was further strengthened via the sale earlier this month of newspaper interests in Bognor Regis and Chichester.</p>

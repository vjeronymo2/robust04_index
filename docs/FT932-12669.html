			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / International Company News: Coca-Cola to buy 30% of Femsa drinks unit FOMENTO Economico Mexicano (Femsa), the largest Mexican beverage and bottling company, has agreed to sell 30 per cent of its soft-drinks division (Femsa Refrescos) to Coca-Cola for Dollars 195m in cash. The soft-drinks division of Femsa accounted for about Dollars 470m of the group's overall revenue of Dollars 2.12bn last year. The purchase values Femsa's soft drinks division at 15.8 times 1992 earnings, and two times book value, said Mr Alfredo Livas, finance director. The transaction is scheduled to be completed in late June or July. After that, Femsa will offer up to 19 per cent of Femsa Refrescos' capital on Mexican and international stock markets, obtaining a separate listing for the soft-drinks division, probably both on the Mexican and New York stock exchanges. The division will not assume any of Femsa's debt. Coca-Cola has about 50 per cent of Mexico's soft drinks market, with Pepsi, the main rival, having 21 per cent. Femsa owns, among others, the Coca-Cola franchise in Mexico City, the largest such franchise in the world. Femsa Refrescos will now become an anchor bottling operation for Coca-Cola in all Latin America, and is likely to be awarded new franchises, both in and out of Mexico, said Mr Roberto Goizueta, Coca-Cola's chief executive. The soft-drinks division plans to invest about Dollars 500m in the next five years in modernising plants and machinery and increasing production to meet demand in the fast growing Mexican cola market. The expansion would be financed by debt, the public offering, and future earnings from the company, executives said. Femsa took on sizeable debt about 18 months ago, when its principal shareholders bought a 56 per cent stake in Bancomer, Mexico's second largest bank, for Dollars 2.88bn (after interest).</p>

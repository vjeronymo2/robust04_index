			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Farouk Chothia, Stephen Laufer, Chris Louw, Steuart </F> Wright]    [Text] The new premier of the Northern Transvaal, Ngoake  Ramatlhodi, is probably the least known of the provincial  leaders. But the 38 year old has a long history of resisting  apartheid since his days as a student leader in Lesotho, where  he lived in exile for 10 years.    Ramatlhodi -- currently deputy registrar and executive  assistant to the principal of the University of North -- was  described this week by his vice-chancellor, Professor Njabulo  Ndebele, as "fair- minded, extremely warm and caring and very  competent.    "You can expect a very self-effacing premier, but extremely  insightful in his understanding of issues."    Ndebele has known Ramatlhodi since 1983, when the latter was  the president of the students' representative council at the  National University in Lesotho and Ndebele was head of the  department of English. "I remember him as a very energetic  leader. Then I didn't seem him for a long time; the South  African government exerted pressure on the ANC to leave  Lesotho, so most of the people left. I only met him again when  I came back."    Ramatlhodi was born at Tauetswala, a small village near  Potgietersrus, on August 2 1955. His father was a mineworker  and his mother a housewife.    In 1976 he enrolled for Bjuris at the University of North,  where he made his name as a poet. Expelled in 1977 for his  political activities, he was later allowed back, but left for  exile on July 17 1980. Today Ramatlhodi holds a masters degree  in law from the University of Lesotho.    He is known to get along very easily with a wide range of  people. Says Ndebele: "I expect him to be somebody who will be  easily acceptable to the different communities in the Northern  Transvaal.    "He can be a person around whom differences can be resolved.    "He inspires confidence and is very self-effacing in a very  humble sort of way, but at the same time can project qualities  of fairmindedness which are necessary when you get into a  leadership position."    Ndebele thought Ramatlhodi would be ably suited to deal with  the rightwing in his area: "He is willing, in the tradition of  the ANC, to meet and talk to everybody, so I don't think he will  pre-judge the rightwing before meeting with them. "He already  said on television that his position is that everyone who is  born here, belongs here, and that he would want to make everyone  comfortable.    "I would presume that if the rightwing presents itself as a  problem, it will not be because the premier is unwilling to meet  them, but because they themselves prefer to be a difficulty."    The bespectacled Frank Mdlalose has two qualities which will  stand him in good stead as premier of KwaZulu/Natal: a good ear  to listen to gripes and an ability to remain impartial when  dissent wrecks a party -- abilities honed in chairing Inkatha  Freedom Party central committee meetings since 1976. Both  qualities will be tested once he assumes his functions as  premier: with the ANC also represented in the 10-member  provincial cabinet, Mdlalose faces the task of seeking consensus  in a divided cabinet and pushing ahead with peace initiatives  and economic development.    By choosing him as its premier, the IFP [Inkatha Freedom  Party] signalled it wants improved relations with the ANC in  KwaZulu/Natal. Mdlalose has built a strong rapport over the  years with his ANC rival, Jacob Zuma -- both have been at the  forefront of attempts to end the 10-year long carnage in the  province.    But Mdlalose's greatest strength -- remaining non-partisan  --  is also seen as a weakness. It has resulted in his failing to  stamp his authority over IFP hardliners and "warloads" who will  feature prominently in the provincial legislature.    He is also said to be a leader who prefers not to antagonise  Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi. It is also said that he has, on  occasion, read speeches drafted by Buthelezi's close confidante,  IFP hardliner Walter Felgate, despite disagreeing with their  contents.    While Mdlalose does not lack experience in the political  arena -- he was minister of the interior in the kwaZulu homeland  and co- leader of the IFP's negotiating team at the World Trade  Centre talks -- there is concern in IFP circles over his health.  Aged 61, he suffered from exhaustion last year after endless  constitutional wrangles and subsequently fractured his knee in a  car accident. Reliant on a walking stick, he subsequently fell  in the bathroom and injured himself again.    But Mdlalose is once more assuming a high public profile in  KwaZulu/Natal. Caught up in the hurly-burly of politics,  Mdlalose finds he has little time to concentrate on his other  interests: tennis and boxing.    In his brash self-confidence, Mathews Phosa is the ANC  regional premier best able to match Western Cape supremo Hernus  Kriel. Secure in the knowledge of his overwhelming election  victory in the Eastern Transvaal, the former head of the ANC's  legal department is likely to be a leader in testing the limits  of regional independence and room to manoeuvre under the  constitution.    Phosa and Kriel have locked horns several times in the  recent  past, and the every-smiling Phosa was rarely bested by the  former law and order minister in arguments over such sensitive  issues as joint SAP[South African Police]/ANC investigations  into the murder of Chris Hani and the shootout between policemen  and Walter Sisulu's bodyguards. But ANC constitutional experts  intent on solidifying the centralist aspects of the new  dispensation could find the two men joining forces in  championing regional powers.    Phosa lists law and business as long-standing interests --  he  made a name for himself as one of the jurists who fought the  South African government's intention to give kaNgwane to  Swaziland. But he is first and foremost a politician, a man who  enjoys the limelight and the rough-and-tumble of crossing swords  with his adversaries.    At 41, he has opted for the premiership of his home region  rather than take his chances in the race for a position in the  national cabinet. While respected for his role in the ANC  underground -- after military training in East Germany he ran  Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation; ANC military wing]  structures in the Eastern Transvaal -- Phosa is said to have  faded as a frontrunner for a cabinet positions because he had  detractors at Shell House.    Born in Mbombela township, Nelspruit, Phosa spent his early  years with his grandfather in Potgietersrus, learning  traditional skills such as hunting, fishing, and tilling. His  political education came from his mother, a nurse during World  War II he describes as "highly political".    On the location of the new Eastern Transvaal capital, Phosa  has said the decision is still open. With opposing lobbies  favouring Nelspruit and Witbank, his wish to see his three  children grow up in his home town might just tip the scales.    Having recently turned 35, Manne Dipico could well have  found himself contemplating the end of his career as a semi-  professional soccer player. But politics intervened, forcing  him to hand up his boots prematurely as he chased a majority for  the ANC in the Northern Cape.    Less than half the age of Eastern Cape premier Raymond  Mhlaba, who is 74, Dipico will be the youngest of the nine  regional premiers when he is sworn in tomorrow. But don't  underestimate him, say former colleagues in the National Union  of Mineworkers [NUM] -- Dipico is an independent thinker, a hard  worker and a popular figure in the region.    And, they might have added, an example of how the unions  nurtured a generation of political leaders through the 1980s.  "His popularity in the Northern Cape is not an abstract thing,"  said NUM deputy general secretary Gwede Mantashe. "People know  him, and the fact we won the region despite predictions to the  contrary is a testament to his ability."    Dipico was born in Kimberley's Greenpoint township and  brought up by his mother, a domestic worker at the town's  hospital. He was fired from De Beers' Finsch Mine for  participating in a wage strike, and later enrolled at the  University of Fort Hare.    An Azanian Student's Organisation activist while at  University, he also joined the ANC's underground structures, and  was detained for his anti-Ciskei activities. Denied readmission  to Fort Hare on his release, he became a fulltime regional  organiser for the NUM in Kimberley.    "He is a team person," commented Mantashe. "He will do his  best to exploit everybody's experience and abilities in the  region, even those of the NP." Doing so will require the charm  and skill Dipico has exhibited as head of the NUM's education  department. He has had to put behind him the memories of his  three years in jail for furthering the aims of the ANC.    Unmarried and without children, Dipico has a major task  ahead  of him as father of the Northern Cape, feels Mantashe. "The  area is rich in mineral and agricultural resources. The  challenge will be to bring investment t?ere which will allow  value to be added to the raw products. If he succeeds, the  Northern Cape can have the highest per capita income in the  country."    In the 1952 defiance campaign in Port Elizabeth a young ANC  activist climbed the stairs at New Brighton Station to sit on a  "Europeans Only" bench. He was arrested and spend a month in  jail. More than 40 years later, Ray Mhlaba (74) climbed ?he same  stairs as the ANC's Eastern Cape premier candidate to tell  thousands of supporters he had already tested the new region's  s?at of power in Bisho.    Sitting behind the desk left vacant by Ciskei dictator  Brigadier Oupa Gqozo, Mhlaba told Ciskei administrator Bongani  Finca: "We are going to rule this country and make sure that no  black man uses the word 'baas' [boss] to a white man. Those  days are gone."    The incident marked the end of Mhlaba's struggle for freedom  as he faced the daunting task of governing u region laced with  apartheid's leftovers.    His position as head of regional government confirmed by  election results, Mhalaba muf? oversee the creation of a single  bureaucracy from what remains of Transkei, Ciskei and the Cape  Pronvicial Administration and the appointment of senior public  servants.    Also burdened with addressing health, housing and education  in the region, human rights campaigner and close friend Rory  Riordan is confident Mhlaba will rise to the challenge. A  former Robben Islander, Mhlaba is among the ANC's "leadership  which is unmatched by any political party on earth.    "He has an unbelievable grasp of political events and an  extraordinary capacity to read people and to move them to where  they should be," he says.    From the cradle of the liberation movement, the Eastern  Cape,  Mhlaba was born in Fort Beaufort and has been inextricably  linked to the politics of the region.    He became involved in the trade union movement in the 1940s  and is now deputy chairman of the SACP [South African Communist  Party].    His leadership first made headlines in 1949 when he headed a  boycott against the South African Railway's discriminatory bus  service. In 1950 he was banned under the Suppression of  Communism Act and in 1952 he led the defiance campaign in the  Eastern Cape.    Long-standing colleague Govan Mbeki says Mhlaba showed the  same leadership in the ANC's underground structures. Ray is a  very courageous person and if there is something that requires  fighting he will be the first to jump in, but in the present  situation I think he will continue to keep his cool," he adds.    Faced with reconciling the past, Mhlaba has already welcomed  the opportunity to work with the NP's Tertius Delport in the  regional government.    Mbeki stresses that one of Mhlaba's greatest virtues is that  he readily smiles and readily laughs and I think that will see  him a long way to being accepted by the people with whom he is  working."</p>

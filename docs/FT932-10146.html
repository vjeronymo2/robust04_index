			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / India vows to punish banks INDIA'S central bank governor has vowed for the first time to penalise banks involved in the country's biggest financial scandal, but gave no hint on the punishment he envisaged, Reuter reports from Bombay. 'We are going to fix responsibilities and award punishments and penalties,' Mr Chakravarty Rangarajan, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor, was quoted as saying in the Economic Times published yesterday. 'For banks as institutions, the RBI will affix responsibilities, while for individuals, it will be done together with the senior management of banks,' Mr Rangarajan said. The scandal involved banks and brokers alleged to have colluded to siphon money from the interbank securities market to pump into the Bombay stock market. Bankers said the RBI could impose fines, hold up promotions of individuals involved, or seek their dismissal or transfer. As an extreme step it could withdraw a bank's licence to operate in a particular financial sphere.</p>

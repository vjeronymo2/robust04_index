			<p><P> April 28, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ON CAMPUS: CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE;  </P> <P> 18 STUDENTS DESIGNING MARS PROBE  </P> <P> Eighteen Cal State Northridge seniors are aiming high and designing a  first-of-its-kind space probe that may someday help scientists analyze the  atmosphere of Mars.  </P> <P> The students' Project Ares, in conjunction with the University Space Research  Assn. and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, is a three-year  effort to design a craft capable of sustained flight in the Martian atmosphere.  </P> <P> Project Director Neil Rubin, senior engineering major, said the purpose of the  probe is to enable scientists to conduct a detailed survey of Mars in  preparation for a possible visit to the planet by astronauts.  </P> <P> When complete, the probe will resemble a sleek, lightweight plane with a  40-foot wingspan. The probe will be powered by lightweight batteries and  wing-mounted solar panels. A specially designed propeller will pull the plane  through the thin, carbon dioxide Martian atmosphere. The collapsible craft is  to be lifted into orbit by a Titan missile.  </P> <P> The students' design and testing work is reviewed by NASA engineers.  </P> <P> The faculty members heading the project are Melvin Epstein, a professor of  mechanical engineering, and Timothy Fox, who chairs the CSUN mechanical  engineering department.  </P> <P> The project, which only seniors are eligible to work on, will be continued by a  new group of students each fall semester.  </P></p>

			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / International Company News: Lauritzen to float subsidiaries Lauritzen Holding plans stock exchange flotations over the next few years of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, which include the J. Lauritzen Shipping Company, the Danyard shipbuilding group, and several manufacturing companies, writes Hilary Barnes in Copenhagen. Lauritzen said yesterday that the flotations would be used to bring the holding company's stake in the subsidiaries down to 52 per cent. Lauritzen reported a first-half loss (before minority shares) of DKr198m (Dollars 32.67m) this year, following a full-year loss of DKr171m in 1993. Lauritzen Shipping made a pre-tax loss of DKr240m in the first half following a loss last year of DKr393m.</p>

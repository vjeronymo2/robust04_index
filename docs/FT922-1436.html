			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Thailand's PM pledges fair election THAILAND'S interim prime minister, Mr Anand Panyarachun, promised yesterday that his government would ensure a clean and orderly election, while pro-military political parties made apparently hopeless last-minute efforts to avert a dissolution of parliament and the calling of a new poll. Mr Anand said in a policy speech to parliament: 'The government will maintain strict political neutrality without assisting or hurting any political parties or groups.' Elections, which Mr Anand said would be 'orderly, clean and fair to all', are expected in September. Mr Anand was appointed caretaker prime minister by King Bhumipol to resolve a political deadlock. At least 50 pro-democracy demonstrators were shot dead by troops last month, forcing the resignation of Gen Suchinda Kraprayoon, the premier installed by the pro-military parties after elections in March. Many people are still missing after the violence, arousing suspicions that they were killed and their bodies secretly disposed of by the army. Opponents of the military blame the outgoing coalition of pro-military parties for failing to restrain the troops during the violence, but politicians in the coalition are reluctant to relinquish power or to mount another expensive election campaign so soon after the last one. Buying votes with cash is common in the rural areas of Thailand where the pro-military politicians hold sway, and members of parliament like to recoup their investment by participating in the lucrative and often corrupt business of government before spending any more money. Some of the politicians loosely grouped in opposition to the coalition have also been known to buy votes. Mr Anand - who ran the country as caretaker prime minister between the coup d'etat in February 1991 and the March elections - said he would continue to promote free market economic policies, and would uphold civil rights and press freedom.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 13 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- Daniel Dultzin,  Mexican Foreign Relations Secretariat economic director, said  that Mexico made "minimal" commitments and agreed to pay an  annual membership fee of $2.6 million to join the OECD.    The official added that the commitments were assumed with  [word indistinct] in the legislation and the Mexican economic  situation and that equitable treatment was also considered, as  well as advancements in economic deregulation insofar as  economic, political, and legal conditions allow.    He said that among the most difficult requirements Mexico  must meet is to achieve strong, sustained growth [words  indistinct] to ensure that foreign businessmen will have greater  freedom to conduct all types of business in Mexico.    Dultzin also said that Mexico will receive the same  treatment  as other members [words indistinct] of the activities [words  indistinct] Mexicans in those nations.    As for the membership fee, Dultzin, who has also served as  technical coordinator for Mexico's integration process with the  OECD since 1993, emphasized that the members' annual  contributions, determined by GDP, population, and exchange rate,  finance the organization.    He also pointed out that joining the international  organization could mean that the Mexican public debt will go  from a 100-percent risk factor [ponderacion] to being risk free,  as is the case with the U.S., German, French, and British debts.    Loans extended to Mexican banks, instead of being subject to  a 100-percent risk factor, as is currently the case, would only  be subject to 20 percent. Dultzin explained, however, that the  country will not receive the benefit automatically.    Mexico had to take several measures to be accepted into the  OECD, such as adjusting [words indistinct] and satisfying  minimum maritime transportation safety requirements.    Dultzin indicated that Mexico's deep sea fishing fleet meets  current safety requirements, while the country's freighters will  be given a stipulated period of time to fulfill the requirements.    He added that consultations were made with the United States  and Canada to solve issues related to the automobile industry  included in the free trade agreement negotiations.    The Mexican official indicated that Mexico's OECD admittance  date, 24 March, had been anticipated from the beginning of the  year, which encouraged more long-term confidence and  self-confidence among Mexicans.    Mexico established relations with the OECD in 1982 after  joining the organization's Steel Committee, where it gradually  increased its participation until it was finally accepted in  1990 as a full member.    In 1991, arrangements were made for an OECD mission [words  indistinct] after which Mexico was accepted as an observer in  several of the organization's committees.</p>

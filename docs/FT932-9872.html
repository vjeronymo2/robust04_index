			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Pounds 1m bail guarantor in hospital MR Ramadan Guney, the Turkish businessman who pledged Pounds 1m towards Mr Asil Nadir's Pounds 3.5m bail, was admitted to St Bartholomew's Hospital in London last night after suffering what his family assumes is a mild stroke, Adrian Michaels writes. His daughter Ms Gonul Guney said that her father was conscious and was being examined last night. 'We don't want to take any chances,' she added. 'Stress takes lots of different forms.' Mr Guney, 61, has not been in good health since Mr Nadir absconded. He is now due to pay his surety or risk a jail sentence. The hospital said it had been instructed by the family not to comment on Mr Guney's condition.</p>

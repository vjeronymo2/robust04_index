			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / UK Company News: Cannon Street Pounds 5.5m in the black - Further disposals under way in move to electronics distribution Cannon Street Investments, the mini-conglomerate, has returned to the black with a Pounds 5.54m pre-tax profit for the year to January 1, compared with losses of Pounds 115.5m. The company has been pruned down from more than 50 small and disparate businesses into a core of three main divisions, but ultimately it has chosen to remould itself as an electronics distribution company. Mr Tom Long, chairman, said that the leisure and food divisions, along with other remnants of CSI's 1980s buy-all strategy, were effectively up for sale. Having undergone significant restructuring, CSI is cash generative and operating profits are almost double interest costs. It therefore no longer has to hurry into further sales of non-core assets. The electronics distribution businesses accounted for Pounds 5.58m (Pounds 1.12m) of CSI's Pounds 8.39m operating profit before Pounds 2.56m of central costs. Food and drink distribution contributed Pounds 1.35m, but the leisure division lost Pounds 245,000, because of problems in its time share and tour business. The hotels remained profitable. Profits from discontinued businesses amounted to Pounds 839,000 but these were more than offset by one-off restructuring costs of more than Pounds 1m. There was a Pounds 2.43m profit from the sale of businesses last year, primarily PM Tamson, the Georgian House Hotel and Cannon Materials Handling  -the latter was sold at a loss. Interest costs fell from Pounds 7.04m to Pounds 2.72m, as a result of debt reduction and falling interest rates. At the year end, net debt amounted to about Pounds 25.4m, down from Pounds 42.9m. The company has restructured its balance sheet to enable it to pay dividends for the first time since October 1992. It will first have to pay the Pounds 2.5m arrears on its preference dividend, however, and it is taking a 'prudent' view on the resumption of ordinary dividends. COMMENT Having sifted through the wreckage of what was once a high-flying conglomerate, the new management of Cannon Street Investments has found a worthwhile core. Its electronics distribution division increased profits fivefold last year, and management plans to build around the Altai subsidiary. Analysts expect profits to exceed Pounds 7m in the current year, putting the shares on a p/e of 11.5. This leaves minimal downside for the shares, while there is considerable upside if it can demonstrate success in building up its new-found core.</p>

			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / Watchdog to quiz banks on records BANKS are to be asked what information they keep on customers, the office of the data protection registrar said yesterday, Steve Thomas writes. The move followed Labour criticism of National Westminster Bank's policy of holding files on the political affiliations and religious opinions of customers. Mr Francis Aldhouse, the deputy data protection registrar, said: 'We will be taking this issue up with all leading banks because we are not quite sure what the situation is.' He said the holding of information about political affiliations was 'potentially sensitive' and suggested customers were entitled to an explanation. The bank said it did not solicit political and religious information but recorded data it judged helpful in building a profile of customers. It had permission from the data protection registrar, Mr Eric Howe, to hold such information.</p>

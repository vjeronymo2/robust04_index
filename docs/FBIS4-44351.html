			<p>BFN     [Text] Algerian Prime Minister Mokdad Sifi has finished his  visit to Paris. After meeting President Francois Mitterrand  yesterday, he held talks today with Foreign Minister Alain  Juppe, who told him that France wants to see legislative  elections organized in Algeria as soon as possible.    The prime minister held a news conference this afternoon, at  the end of his two-day working visit. To those who ask his  country to talk with the Islamists, he had this to say:    [Begin Sifi recording] I ask this of those who, far from the  realities of the situation on the ground, advise us to  negotiate: With whom? People tell us about the moderates all  the time. There are many moderates in the National Transition  Council. Who are the other moderates one hears about? Where  are these moderates? Let them declare themselves, and let them  condemn violence and terrorism. The doors of dialogue are wide  open to them. Let them come.    President Zeroual and my government are in favor of dialogue  with all those who first unequivocally and without rhetoric  condemn violence and terrorism. [end recording]</p>

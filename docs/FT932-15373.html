			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / Rush to join the Securities Institute: Number of applications far exceeds estimates A SURPRISINGLY high number, some 8,500 people, applied to join the new Securities Institute during its first year of operation to March 31, far exceeding the internal target of 5,500. The institute's chief executive, Mr Tim Nicholson, said: 'There has been a wall of application forms.' It appears that about 3,500 applications flooded in during the final few weeks as City securities industry professionals sought to take last-minute advantage of a 'window of opportunity'. Established practitioners applying up to March 31 were offered membership on the basis only of regulatory checks and, in some cases, interviews. Full membership will now only be granted to those who pass examinations lasting nine hours. The institute was set up last year after the Stock Exchange ended its facility for personal membership. Its aim is to promote professional standards and ethics, which have been under pressure in the securities industry is some respects since the Stock Exchange's 'Big Bang' in 1986. Members may adopt the initials MSI on business cards and letterheads. About 4,600 applications have come from the 5,000 former members of the Stock Exchange. The nearly 4,000 other applications suggests the new association will embrace a wider professional community. The institute was successful in attracting interest from practitioners in areas such as investment management, corporate finance and futures trading. Individuals from many national and regional law firms have applied, along with accountancy and investment bankers, including some from Hill Samuel and Samuel Montagu. 'The securities trade has always lacked an effective focal point,' said Mr Nicholson. 'We are bridging the gap and the trade is responding. We have the Law Society and Institute of Chartered Accountants, now the securities industry is getting the representation it deserves.' Unqualified applicants hoping to gain membership before examinations become compulsory faced a torrid time negotiating the rigorous admissions criteria. A strict membership system will include an eight-page application form, detailed references from institute members or the directors of the applicant's firm, and thorough regulatory checks. Mr Nicholson accepts there will be some disreputable applicants: 'We will be looking for individuals with substance. Almost half of these 'outside' applicants will be interviewed to check their credentials.' With headquarters next to the Monument in the City, the institute is forming 18 branches in the UK and offshore.</p>

			<p><P> November 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Interest Rates Fall: The Treasury sold $8.0 billion of new three-month bills at  an average discount rate of 7.61%, down from 7.68% last week. Another $8.0  billion of new six-month bills was sold at an average discount rate of 7.40%,  down from 7.51% last week. The rates were the lowest since three-month bills  sold for 7.52% on Oct. 23 and six-month bills averaged 7.35% on July 31. The  new discount rates understate the actual return to investors -- 7.86% for  three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling for $9,809.80 and 7.79% for a  six-month bill selling for $9,627.90. The discount rate reflects the price  discount received when government securities are purchased at less than face  value.  </P></p>

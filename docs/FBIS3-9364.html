			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu has received  Bernd Wilz, parliamentary state secretary in charge of defense  in the Bundestag, accompanied by Klaus Franke, chairman of the  German-Romanian Friendship Parliamentary Group.    In their discussion the two sides focused on continuing the  political dialogue at various levels and on relations between  the two armies. They also examined ways and means to put the  Partnership for Peace plan into practice, as well as a number of  international issues, including the situation in former  Yugoslavia and in the Russian Federation.    The two sides also discussed the visits a number of German  figures will pay to Romania this year: Minister of Defense  Volker Ruehe, whose visit is scheduled to take place at the  beginning of April; Foreign Minister Affairs Klaus Kinkel;  Carl-Dieter Spranger, federal minister of economic cooperation;  and Bundestag President Rita Suessmuth.    Romania's relations with Germany are of particular  importance  within the context in which Germany is broaching relations with  the states in the (?Balkan) area pragmatically and  indiscriminately, said the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs, Mircea Geoana, to our reporter Eugen Baboi at the end  of the talks.</p>

Final  </P> <P> SOUTHLAND;  </P> <P> 2ND LOTTO WINNER CLAIMS PRIZE  </P> <P> Eduardo Melgar, a 40-year-old carpenter, was on his way to buy a Christmas tree  when he stopped at a store to check his "quick pick" numbers for last week's  Lotto 6/53 draw.  </P> <P> It was then that he learned he had split the $4.48-million Dec. 12 jackpot with  another San Bernardino County resident.  </P> <P> "I can't believe it . . . my dream came true," he told California Lottery  officials, who identified him today as the second of two jackpot winners.  </P> <P> They named Luz Martinez of San Bernardino last Friday as the first to claim a  $2.24-million share of the prize. She purchased her ticket only 15 miles from  where Martinez, of Fontana, bought his.  </P></p>

			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Banks dial M for money: The growth of telephone banking in the UK In many ways, British banks use technology in a primitive fashion. Yet a trail of visitors to a nondescript industrial estate on the outskirts of Leeds indicates one exception. This is the sole office of a bank whose customers carry out their transactions by telephone. It is an experiment which is being watched closely by rivals. Firstdirect is the part of Midland Bank that most excited Mr John Bond, chief executive of HSBC Holdings following its acquisition of the UK bank last summer. Three years after it was founded, other retail banks have stopped dismissing Firstdirect as too clever by half. Instead, they are defending themselves against it as it adds 12,000 to its 350,000 customers each month. This year is likely to mark a turning point for telephone banking in a market which has relied on dense branch networks. National Westminster Bank has launched a pilot telephone bank called PrimeLine; TSB is trying out a telephone service along with branches in Newcastle-upon-Tyne; Royal Bank of Scotland is mulling a national service for its 800 branches. Those involved enthuse about the potential for telephone banking in a country that had been thought too conservative to accept it. 'It is very simple to introduce, and it is not a huge capital investment,' says Mr Mike Summers of TSB. 'We think it will grow dramatically through the 1990s,' says Mr Larry Cattle, NatWest's head of customer relationships. The change of mood is prompted by a decline in the use of Britain's 12,000 bank branches. On average, bank customers visited a branch only 2.2 times a month last year compared with 2.6 times in 1991, according to an NOP survey. About 2m bank customers now seek account information and carry out bank transactions by telephone or by computer. Mr Kevin Newman, chief executive of Firstdirect, estimates that between 10 and 20 per cent of UK bank customers could switch to telephone banks. Firstdirect takes 12,000 calls in 24 hours; an average of 1.2 from each customer per month. Customers use Midland teller machines to obtain cash, but otherwise make transactions by telephone and post. The cost savings are substantial. Firstdirect's cost to income ratio remains above banks with branch networks because it has relatively few customers. Mr Newman estimates, however, that as its customer base grows, it may get down to between 40 and 45 per cent, compared with Midland's current ratio of 68 per cent. 'I don't see how branch banks will be able to compete with us,' he says. An even bigger potential strength of telephone banks is in generation of income. By careful marketing, and sifting of applications, Firstdirect has acquired a customer base of rich potential. It has proved attractive to professional employees with limited time to visit branches, and enough disposable income to buy other products such as insurance. 'They are not just yuppies. The appeal is far broader than even we expected,' says Mr Newman. Some three quarters of his customers are aged between 25 and 45; most are 'considerably up-market'; and 40 per cent are women. Affluent customers, he says, are less likely to stick with their old bank through inertia. Firstdirect is thus squeezing other banks in two ways. It is taking away some of their best customers - three quarters of its customers are being acquired from outside Midland. And its low cost base means it may be able to hold out indefinitely against introducing charges on accounts in credit. Small wonder that others are rushing to defend themselves. The most direct imitation of Firstdirect so far is NatWest's PrimeLine. As yet, this is tiny, aiming to recruit only 9,000 customers this year. But, like Firstdirect, it is aiming its service at upmarket customers; it has even gone a stage further by offering each customer a personal manager. One advantage is that NatWest may be able to use PrimeLine to retain customers when it shuts a branch. It is expected to cut 100 branches a year during the next three years in an attempt to cut costs. 'A bank with a telephone subsidiary may manage to switch over some good customers it would otherwise lose,' says Mr Graham Gould, of the financial services consultant Coba-MID. Yet most British banks are opting for a different model. Rather than having separate telephone banking subsidiaries, they are setting up support services for existing branches. That is the type of telephone banking already established in US banks such as Wells Fargo in California and which has been studied by Royal Bank of Scotland. Smaller retail banks such as Co-operative Bank and Girobank have already set up telephone services to support small branch networks. Banks with large branch networks now face a tricky calculation. Most of them are cutting branches to trim costs, and must work out whether a telephone service will help that process, or merely add another layer of expense. The extent to which banks can reduce costs by combining telephone services with branch networks is, however, still unclear. Both Girobank and the Co-operative Bank have high cost income ratios compared with others: the Co-op's ratio is 75 per cent. 'Some people think of telephone banking as a low cost delivery channel, but often you just add another layer of costs,' says Mr Gould. For this reason, TSB has proceeded cautiously by setting up an experiment in Newcastle-upon-Tyne this month. It is using what it calls an 'umbrella' 24-hour banking service to support a slimmed-down branch network. Out of 30 branches, it has closed eight, and 'semi-automated' seven others by replacing staff with teller machines providing basic services. TSB thinks this may ease the cost constraints facing telephone banking by cutting branch costs at the same time. 'I think people need some bricks and mortar in their bank, but I don't think they need a lot, and certainly not as much as they used to,' says Mr Summers, TSB's marketing director. A second imponderable facing potential entrants to telephone banking is income generation. Mr Newman argues that customers are more receptive to being sold products by telephone banks because they have set time aside to ring, and are not standing in a branch queue. Firstdirect calculates that its accounts are on average worth 15 per cent more than in branch banks with similar customer profiles. Yet it may be hard for others to repeat this. Firstdirect's customers - many of them young professionals - are of a generation happy to conduct business by telephone. It could be trickier for branch banks to persuade their older customers to switch from face-to-face contact to telephones. Such obstacles are unlikely to stem the flow of visitors to Firstdirect. Mr Bond has sent word to HSBC subsidiaries to come and see it. 'I find Firstdirect exciting. It is a classic case of finding a new way of reaching customers,' he says. But it is still unclear how many want to be reached this way.</p>

			<p><P> November 20, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MCCAIN COAXED TO MEET S&amp;L MONITOR -- AIDE  </P> <P> An aide to Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) told the Senate Ethics Committee today  that Sen. Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.), tried to coax her boss into meeting with  federal regulators on behalf of savings and loan millionaire Charles H. Keating  Jr.  </P> <P> The committee explored the role of the two senators in those meetings with  federal regulators as it began a fourth day of hearings into allegations that  five senators improperly intervened on behalf of Keating and his Lincoln  Savings and Loan.  </P> <P> Today's testimony revealed the divisions and conflicting stories among the five  senators who are battling for their political reputations and futures.  </P> <P> Gwendolyn van Paasschen, an economics aide to McCain, testified she felt that  her boss was "being coaxed along into" a meeting with top S&amp;L regulator  Edwin Gray. She said she felt that DeConcini wanted McCain there because as a  Republican he would lend a bipartisan aura to the meeting.  </P> <P> She was concerned, she said, because at the time of that April, 1987, meeting,  McCain had received more in campaign contributions from Keating than had  DeConcini.  </P></p>

Paektu Is Firm Guarantee of </F> Accomplishing Revolutionary Cause of Chuche" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, January 15 (KCNA) -- The revolutionary  spirit of Mt. Paektu was created in the days of the  anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle waged under the wise  guidance of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song. It is a  spirit of unfailing loyalty to the leader, a revolutionary  spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle to tide over  difficulties by one's own effort and an indomitable  revolutionary spirit of rising again and fighting even if one  might fall a thousand and one times. NODONG SINMUN says this in  an article today.    The article says:    The revolutionary spirit of Mt. Paektu underlies the  tremendous force that made it possible to defeat the Japanese  and the U.S. imperialists in the past and build a socialist  power of independence, self-sustenance and self-reliance in  defence on this land. Now it serves as an invincible  ideological and moral weapon for the Korean people who are  carrying the Korean-style socialist cause through to  accomplishment.    It is, above all, an eternal life-giving water that helps  the  entire Korean people hold in high esteem the dear leader Comrade  Kim Chong-il with unfailing loyalty.    It contains the revolutionary attitude toward the leader and  view of life that should be acquired by the chuche-type  revolutionaries faithful to the party and the leader.    When we actively learn from the spirit, we can all become  true revolutionaries like anti-Japanese revolutionary  forerunners who staunchly fought with one mind of loyalty to the  leader in any circumstances.    The revolutionary spirit of Mt. Paektu also powerfully  encourages the Korean people to glorify the Korean-style  socialism holding aloft the revolutionary banner of  self-reliance and hard struggle.    The anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle was an arduous  revolutionary war fought against the Japanese imperialists armed  to the teeth in reliance on one's own strength with neither a  state support nor foreign assistance.    The anti-Japanese revolutionary fighters always pulled  through difficulties by displaying highly the revolutionary  spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle in their struggle full  of trials, and fully displayed the revolutionary habit of  unconditionally carrying out any difficult and hard  revolutionary tasks by their own effort.    The revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle  displayed highly in those days has now become a powerful  ideological and moral source for the Korean people in thoroughly  implementing the party's revolutionary economic strategy and  successfully building the Korean-style socialism.    Self-reliance is the only way to smash the imperialists'  economic blockade and effect a steady upsurge in socialist  economic construction.    There will be no tasks we cannot carry out, or no fortress  we  cannot occupy when we continue to actively follow the  revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle  displayed by the anti- Japanese revolutionary fighters.    The revolutionary spirit of Mt. Paektu is the ideological  and  moral source of the strength that enables the Korean people to  staunchly go along the road of revolution with an indomitable  fighting spirit and strong will.</p>

			<p><P> September 25, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA;  </P> <P> $1.3 MILLION IN FEES COLLECTED BY SCHOOLS  </P> <P> The Ventura Unified School District collected more than $1.3 million in fees  from developers last year, according to a district report made public for the  first time under a new state law.  </P> <P> The sum included more than $1 million collected for new residential buildings  in the city, which totaled 880 last year, the report said.  </P> <P> Fees totaling $107,217 were also paid for additions to existing homes.  </P> <P> The remainder of the fees, more than $133,000, was paid for new commercial  developments. The district waived fees of $46,154 for several businesses exempt  under the law.  </P> <P> State law requires that developers be charged for new construction in  high-growth areas to help provide classroom space at local schools. The law was  amended last year to require school districts and other agencies to report the  fees annually.  </P> <P> The district receives $1.50 for each square foot of new residential  construction and 25 cents per square foot of new commercial construction.  </P> <P> Although the fees have been part of the district's budget for several years,  "this is the first time we've been required to make an actual report to the  board on it and make it available to the public," said Jean Rudolph,  administrative assistant for business services.

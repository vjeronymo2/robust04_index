			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / International Company News: TWA's operating losses worsen TRANS WORLD AIRLINES, the bankrupt US carrier owned by Mr Carl Icahn, has posted an after-tax loss of Dollars 50.3m for June. This brings the ailing airline's deficit for the second quarter to Dollars 88.9m. The carrier lost a similar amount - Dollars 86.8m - in the first three months of the year. However, the after-tax figures are distorted to some extent by proceeds from asset sales. Recent operating results show a deteriorating trend, with losses increasing from Dollars 15m in March, to Dollars 26.4m in April, Dollars 39.5m in May and Dollars 43.3m in June. In June, revenues were Dollars 304.8m, compared with Dollars 291.8m in the previous month, but expenses also increased to Dollars 348.1m - against Dollars 331.2m in May. Because TWA is in bankruptcy, it is obliged to report results on a monthly basis. Mr Icahn has been attempting to resolve the heavily indebted company's future. One mooted scheme would involve him ceding about 55 per cent of the carrier's equity to creditors, in return for giving debt, while employees would take the remaining 45 per cent, in exchange for wage concessions. Last week, TWA reached an agreement in principle with one of the three leading unions involved - the flight attendants - but the scheme still needs to overcome a variety of hurdles. At the end of June, TWA also acknowledged holding talks with USAir and 'others' over possible asset sales. USAir is planning to link with British Airways, the UK carrier, investing Dollars 750m for a minority stake.</p>

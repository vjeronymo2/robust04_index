But Will Life Become Safer?"]    [Text] The Security Council Interdepartmental Commission  for Combatting Crime and Corruption has elaborated a federal  program to combat this evil. It will be presented for the  scrutiny of the Security Council in the near future.    In an exclusive interview with your IZVESTIYA correspondent,  Major General of Justice Anatoliy Korotkov, leader of a Russian  Federation Security Council Interdepartmental Commission for  Combating Crime and Corruption working group, reported that  whereas previously the fight against crime has been conducted in  an uncoordinated manner by different departments, now the first  attempt has been made to coordinate all these efforts and to  resolve at state level the problem of protecting the life and  health of Russian citizens.    But how is it planned to combat crime -- whose scale and  pace  are increasing almost daily?    In Korotkov's opinion, reorganization will be necessary in  the spheres of both legislation and organization. It is planned  to direct all law enforcement activities toward protecting the  rights of the individual. Today, for example, if your car is  stolen, in practice nobody bears responsibility for this. But  now, according to the new program, it will not only be the thief  who is responsible for the theft but also the staffers of the  law enforcement agency on whose territory the theft took place  and who were unable to guarantee the automobile's safety.    Today, he says, we have for the first time come up against a  new type of crime -- contract killing. In developed capitalist  countries it is not ordinary policemen who fight hired killers  but specially trained professionals. But here it is basically  precinct cops who fight hired killers. We have proved  unprepared both morally and legislatively for the struggle  against this new type of crime. Hence the low rate of  detection. The new program pays much attention to this new type  of crime and envisages the creation of a special antiterrorist  center.</p>

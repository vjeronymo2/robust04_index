			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Business and the Law: Maternity rights - Legal briefs The Law Society's governing council last week adopted a proposal by the Association of Women Solicitors to enhance maternity rights to women law firm partners, as part of its model anti-discrimination policy. The move is in line with maternity rights for all women employees under the 1978 Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act. Equity partners, not being employees, fall outside the statutory protection.</p>

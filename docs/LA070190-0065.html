			<p><P> July 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: IN BRIEF:;  </P> <P> *** STEVE VAI, "PASSION AND WARFARE," RELATIVITY. ALBUMS RATED ON A SCALE OF  ONE STAR (POOR) TO FIVE (A CLASSIC).  </P> <P> Having contributed withering GIT-tar fire to the likes of Zappa, Roth,  White-snake and the "Crossroads" movie, maestro Steve Vai cuts loose with a  solo album of instrumentals (vaguely) linked by kozmik spoken-word bullstuff.  </P> <P> The playing, of course, is dazzling. Vai has an impressive musical vocabulary  -- and a tendency to slice 'n' dice every hip triptych known to man or  machine-head into every square moment. The result is an intense, if somewhat  wearying, experience. Don Waller  </P></p>

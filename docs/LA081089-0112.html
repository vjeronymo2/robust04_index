			<p><P> August 10, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> A group of children in Lebanon, Pa., used a playground as headquarters for a  make-believe drug ring, selling neatly packaged bags of sugar and grass  clippings that looked like cocaine and marijuana, police said. Authorities  speculated that the children -- who were believed to be 12 or younger -- were  either emulating their parents or being trained for the drug business. A tackle  box stacked with bogus drugs and colored slips of paper detailing the group's  transactions was turned over to police last week after two children found it in  a tree at the dilapidated playground. Police had not interviewed any children  in the case.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> General Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 1:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Petitioners contend that the Department should run its sales below cost of production (COP) test on comparison models only, not on entire such or similar categories. Petitioners argue that forklifts are not a fungible product, but are instead similar to ``job order'' products such as mechanical transfer presses, offshore oil platforms, and large power transformers. Petitioners assert that the unique nature of each product means that there is often just one HM sale that is comparable to the U.S. sale, and that if the single HM sale is sold below COP, there likely will be no dumping margin. Petitioners state that this case is distinguishable from other dumping cases ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> agricultural, chemical, or metals cases) because relatively few HM sales are weight-averaged. Petitioners accordingly argue that the Department should conduct the sales below COP test on the concordance tape containing comparison models only, not on the universe of HM sales.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> TCM argues that, because forklift trucks are not custom-built products, the Department correctly applied the COP test. TCM further states that the Department should maintain its policy of conducting the COP test on each load capacity category.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's Position:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We agree with petitioners. In accordance with our standard policy, we have revised the sales below COP test so that the test is conducted on a model-specific basis instead of on a such-or-similar category basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 2:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Petitioners state that the Department should revise its model match methodology because it gives insufficient weight to tire type and, therefore, results in more matches of merchandise, but not in matches that are the most similar. Petitioners contend that tire type is a crucial attribute of a forklift truck because the tire type determines the construction of the frame of the truck, which the Department found to be the ``identifying feature and principal component of the product'' in the final determination in this case (Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Certain Internal Combustion Industrial Forklift Trucks from Japan (Forklifts LTFV), 53 FR 12552 (April 15, 1988)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Petitioners suggest three alternative methods for the such or similar comparisons and tire type matching. First, petitioners recommend that the Department return to the original less than fair value matching methodology. Second, petitioners propose increasing the weight for tire type from six to ten points. Finally, petitioners state that matches with less than fifteen points do not constitute similar merchandise because the predominant features of the HM merchandise would be substantially different from the U.S. truck; petitioners argue that the Department should therefore omit all HM sales with less than fifteen points.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> TCM notes that the Department's current model match methodology was revised in order to improve the model match process. TCM and Toyota argue that the Department's matching methodology, which gives tire type the highest weight, establishes tire type as the most important criterion. Toyota contends that petitioners' assertion that forklift trucks cannot be similar unless they have an SSM index number of fifteen is unreasonable. This cut-off would eliminate matches of trucks that are ``identical in every respect&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;except upright style and its related maximum fork height.'' Respondents further argue that the Department's twenty percent difference in merchandise test already eliminates dissimilar models, and that the cut-off suggested by petitioners would merely result in a greater number of unmatched sales.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's Position:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We agree with respondents. During the first administrative review, we refined the model match methodology used in the less-than-fair-value (LTFV) investigation. We are employing this same model match methodology for these final results. One such improvement was the use of a point-weighting scheme, which increased the precision and simplified the reporting requirements. Of the six model match elements, we attach the most weight to tire type. Petitioners did not provide evidence to support their claim that the points accorded to tire type should be increased from six to ten, or that dissimilar models were matched as the result of a flaw in our methodology. For further discussion of our model match methodology see Comment 80, Certain Internal-Combustion, Industrial Forklift Trucks from Japan; Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review (Forklifts I), (57 FR 3167, January 28, 1992).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 3:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Petitioners' claim that the Department's adjustment for the consumption tax forgiven upon exportation of forklift trucks to the United States is erroneous in several respects. Petitioners state that the Court of International Trade (CIT) has held that taxes on sales in the HM must be passed through to the customer before an upward adjustment of an imputed tax can be made to United States price (USP), and cite  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Zenith Electronics Corp.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 755 F. Supp. 397 (CIT 1990) ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Zenith I <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ),  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Daewoo Electronics Co.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 712 F. Supp. 931 (CIT 1989) ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Daewoo <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Zenith Electronics Corp.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 633 F. Supp. 1382 (CIT 1988) ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Zenith II <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) in support of this proposition. Petitioners contend that no adjustment is warranted in this case, since neither Toyota nor TCM claimed or proved that the consumption tax imposed on HM sales is passed through to the customers in Japan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Petitioners further argue that the Department improperly made an adjustment to foreign market value (FMV) to eliminate the absolute difference between the amount of tax in the two markets by adding to FMV the amount of the consumption tax imputed to the U.S. sale. Petitioners state that it is improper for the Department to make such an adjustment in the interest of achieving tax neutrality.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Toyota argues that petitioners' arguments disregard the Department's policy and practice with respect to adjustments to FMV and USP for the Japanese consumption tax. Toyota cites the Department's disagreement with the CIT decisions cited by petitioners. Toyota asserts that it is the Department's long-standing practice not to attempt to measure the amount of tax passed through to customers in the HM. Under the Department's interpretation, section 772(d)(1)(C) of the Tariff Act does not require the Department to measure the incidence of tax in an economic sense. Rather, according to Toyota, the full adjustment for consumption tax is necessary to make an appropriate comparison between USP and FMV. Toyota states that in determinations involving HM taxes, the Department has repeated that it has not had an opportunity to appeal the issue on the merits. Until such time as the issue is finally resolved on appeal, the Department should maintain its long-standing practice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

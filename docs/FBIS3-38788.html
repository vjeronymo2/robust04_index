			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Excerpts" of speech by Defense Minister Volker Ruehe to a </F> security policy conference in Munich on 5 February: "We Lack  the Capability To Participate Effectively in Settling  International Conflicts"]    [Text] It has become fashionable in Germany to mention new  figures for the strength of the Bundeswehr every weekend --  without taking into consideration the security situation, the  tasks of our armed forces, and the sensitive organism with which  we are dealing.    A discussion that focuses primarily on troop strengths  neglects the complicated links between the tasks of the  Bundeswehr and the capability resulting from the situation,  between the operational readiness level and mobilization, and  between structure and deployment. In addition, the links  between the Bundeswehr's obligations as an alliance partner and  domestic defense, and finally the defense system and the funds  that are available play a decisive role here.    Changes in one of these factors also change the entire  system  of the Bundeswehr. Minor adjustments in one area may exacerbate  the situation in another sphere.    Thinking about the future of our armed forces means first of  all getting used to the idea that we are facing two phases of a  longer process.    After Germany's reunification, it was, above all, important  for the Bundeswehr to take over and dissolve the National  People's Army, to establish the Bundeswehr in eastern Germany,  to reduce the all-German armed forces by almost 50 percent, to  reorganize part of their deployment, and to prepare them for new  tasks.    After the reduction of the armed forces to the stipulated  level of 370,000 soldiers this year, the first phase of this  process will largely be completed.    It is now important to redefine in detail the capabilities  and planned structures of the Bundeswehr while taking into  consideration the security-political situation, our increased  international responsibility, and the tasks resulting therefrom  for the Bundeswehr and the armed forces that Germany wants to  have and to keep. In spite of limited funds, the Bundeswehr  must fulfill its future tasks.    An analysis of the strategic situation shows that a  large-scale aggression can no longer be the central criterion  and yardstick for our defense concept and military planning.    The supreme goal of German defense policy will naturally  remain the protection of Germany and of our alliance partners  within NATO and the European Union against attacks from outside.  This is the most dangerous but at the same time most unlikely  scenario.    Crises and conflicts that erupt at smaller or larger  distances but which may turn into a threat for individual or  several alliance partners through regional escalation are more  likely to occur in the future. It is in Germany's vital  security interest to contain such critical developments  regionally and to prevent them from spreading to Central Europe.    Thus, the Bundeswehr will have to fulfill two main defense  tasks in the future. First, it must be in a position to  contribute to settling probable international crises and  conflicts together with allies and partners; second, it must be  able to increase its strength and provide sufficient defense  forces for the unlikely and most dangerous case -- that is for  the defense of Germany and the alliance.    These main functions of the Bundeswehr are to be coordinated  with each other and, as a result, they must ensure that Germany  will retain its defense and reaction capability and continue to  be able to develop policies and to fulfill its duties as an  alliance partner in crises.    The needs and possibilities for domestic defense and crisis  management will require a clear differentiation of the training  and operational readiness in correspondence with the task.    The strategic situation makes it possible to clearly reduce  the operational readiness level for domestic defense. The  militarily usable warning time for the highly improbable event  of a large-scale planned aggression suggests shifting the  training for operational readiness for individual units of the  expandable main defense forces to times of crises. Thus, part  of the main defense forces might then be relieved from their  operational mission in peacetime.    Because of Germany's geostrategic situation, a special  contribution to the strength of the main defense forces in  Central Europe that are based on the principle of mobilization  is a decisive factor for Germany's influence in the alliance.    The mobilization capacity of the main defense forces is a  vital element in national defense and for Germany's weight  concerning a major task of NATO, that is collective defense.    National defense and compulsory military service are two  sides of the same coin. Just like in France, compulsory  military service is a central element of Germany's defense  culture.    Generally, the Bundeswehr is equipped with relatively modern  weapons for domestic defense. What we are lacking is the  capacity to be able to participate efficiently in the settlement  of international crises.    Thus, we need a German contingent of crisis reaction forces  that is capable of carrying out combined operations in  cooperation with alliance partners while covering the whole  spectrum of possible operations.    The need for adaptation within the Bundeswehr results from  the need to efficiently establish a basic capacity for crisis  management, to make sensible use of the compulsory military  service, and to gain planning leeway in view of the tight budget  situation to make it possible to fulfill the task with the funds  available. This also includes that rationalization measures  within the Bundeswehr should lead to investments.    The Bundeswehr will be developed further as a whole organic  system. Priorities that reflect the changed tasks of the  Bundeswehr will be set in this respect. First of all, they will  affect the required fundamental military capabilities.    The future strength of the crisis reaction forces, the  greater extent of differentiation among the main defense forces,  the operational rationalization, and the streamlining of  structures will make it possible to reduce personnel. This will  have an impact on the internal structures of the armed forces,  the personnel strength, and the deployment.    However, fast changes concerning the basis for financial  planning will ruin every orderly process. Thus, what the  Bundeswehr needs for its development in the next few years is a  secure conceptual and financial basis.</p>

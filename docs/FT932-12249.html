			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Survey of Business Schools (9): The aim need not be 'publish or perish' - High quality business school research may be scarce, but research is not all TREAT with caution the dean's blurb about teaching and research being 'top quality' in his school, with the two going 'hand-in-hand'. The number of business schools engaging in top-notch research is small; and frankly, much management education does not require intense research back-up to make it effective. In the UK, external assessment and validation of research and teaching is opening business/management schools to critical self-examination as never before. The Universities Funding Council's research assessment exercise, published late last year, divided state-funded institutions into five categories. These range between those institutions publishing work of 'international excellence' (grade 5) and those giving evidence of excellent research in 'none, or virtually none, of the sub areas of activity' (grade 1). The conclusion: high quality is scarce. Only seven institutions were rated by the UFC rated at level 5 (see table). A further four were placed at level 4 ('national excellence' in most areas of research). Well-known universities, including Manchester and Cranfield, were among the 71 making it to neither camp. More than a third of the total (31 of of 83) were consigned to level 1. Furthermore, since the UFC's assessment is used as the basis for allocating government funding for research, to those that have . . . Despite the American 'publish or perish' culture, seasoned observers would distribute US business schools in roughly similar proportions, with a clear divide between 'Ivy League' schools on the one hand, and on the other community colleges and state business schools, most of which have lacklustre research records. It is the same on the continent - particularly in Italy and Spain - where the mushrooming of business schools has not yielded commensurate growth in research output. Back in the UK, the 31 institutions rated by the UFC at grade 1 include most of the former polytechnics. Their business schools mostly date from the early-to-mid 1980s, when the 'milch cow' attraction of business schools was at its highest and the discrimination of consumers at its poorest. It was then, also, that demand for part-time courses exploded, particularly from middle and junior managers who had previously seen business schools as being above them. The new part-time market needed four things above all: proximity, cheapness, flexibility, and bona fide degrees. Polytechnics were well-placed to provide all three. Research did not feature on the list; indeed, until last year polys did not even have access to the UFC research funding. Professor David Ashton, chairman of the Association of Business Schools and dean of Lancaster University's School (which gained a grade 5) views this situation as inevitable. 'It is doubtful whether the country can sustain more than a dozen or so serious research institutions; the real question is, should so many universities be devoting themselves to research at all?' Which begs the further question: how important is research to teaching? The answer depends upon what is being taught. Profiles, in this survey, of the management schools of Cranfield Institute of Technology and the London School of Economics, both universities with high reputations, make the point. Cranfield's Professor Leo Murray is 'bothered enormously' by the 'publish or perish' mentality: 'Highly academic and technical papers may be very clever, but most of them are fairly useless to the job of management, and so to the task of the business school, which is highly vocational.' Murray 'emphasises the 'D' in research and development.' By contrast, according to Professor Peter Abell of the LSE, management should be seen as a study growing out of rigorous social science, which is nothing without heavy duty data analysis and sophisticated explanatory models. In a sense, both are right. For a tutor planning and teaching a vocational MBA, hands-on business experience may indeed be more use than tomes to one's name on chaos theory (Murray, it should be noted, is a former director of Rothmans and a long time executive); whereas for undergraduate or graduate courses combining social science and management, theory is almost all (Abell was professor of sociology at the universities of Surrey and Birmingham before moving to the LSE). One type of management course is not inherently better than another; they are just different. For the unwitting potential student, the important thing to understand is where institutions are coming from: in particular how their research traditions (or lack of them) inform the content of their courses and the style of their teaching. This is particularly important at the graduate level, where curriculums vary enormously and the predilections of individual academics count for much. In the UK, the issue is further complicated by the the debate over the validation of management courses by the National Council for Vocational Qualifications. The council, through its agent the Management Charter Initiative, has been seeking to impose uniform standards on management courses qualifying for National Vocational Qualification (NVQ) status at various levels roughly corresponding to management tiers. MCI's emphasis is on managers demonstrating competence at carrying out management tasks appropriate to their level and situation. The process of setting the standards - which are the benchmarks for validating courses on the NVQ scale - has been fraught. There has been protracted argument between MCI and degree and qualification awarding bodies (both universities and suppliers of qualifications such as the Business and Technology Education Council). To the layman, much of the disputation looks to be of the 'angels on a point of a pin' variety. However, the key issue is clear enough: how far should management courses, particularly at front-line and middle-manager level, be testing competences in the workplace, and how far should they be seeking to test knowledge accumulated through study? For universities, particularly the former polytechnics serving predominantly the bottom of the management pyramid, NVQ accreditation for their courses is critical, because employers and students alike are increasingly demanding it. 'But', says the head of one such business school, 'there must be a limit to how far we will prostitute ourselves in pursuit of a fundamentally mistaken venture. ' Andrew Summers, MCI's chief executive, responds: 'The real source of the trouble is that NVQs are new. Universities have traditionally based their assessment on knowledge; in management what matters is what you do with the knowledge. MCI is anxious that business qualifications show whether or not you can perform as a manager. For that, you need knowledge, but you need far more.' But Summers says he is 'the first to concede' that institutions will neither want nor need NVQ validation for all their courses, even when MCI's 'management standards' reach senior managers. 'There will always be a role for two different types of management course: essentially knowledge-based courses, for which NVQs have no role; and more vocational courses, where they will. We are not forcing anyone into our mould.' Perhaps. But many business schools feel that they are in a vice: in order to to curry favour with the UFC they need to churn out the research; to please MCI, they have to be glorified training departments. It is time, perhaps, for their deans to get down those tomes on corporate strategy.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UK BUSINESS SCHOOL RESEARCH EVALUATED*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 'Research of international excellence in some areas, and of national excellence in virtually all others:'  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                  Bradford University                  Lancaster University                  Strathclyde University                  Warwick University                  London Business School                  London School of Economics**                  UMIST (Manchester)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 'Research of national excellence in virtually all areas:'  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                  City University                  Loughborough University                  Southampton University                  Cardiff University                  Lancaster University  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *ratings for research in field of 'business and management studies' **for information systems only  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Universities Funding Council  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bolivia's embarrassment of riches - Passions aroused by an ancient silver mine AN ANCIENT Bolivian silver mine, thought to have been exhausted 200 years ago, may still hold the largest reserve of silver in the world. Frustratingly for the poorest country in South America, the exploitation of this resource is highly problematic and the discovery has disturbed more people than it has excited. The Cerro Rico or 'Rich Hill', a rust-coloured mountain that towers over the town of Potosi, was the legendary peak of solid silver that financed the Spanish Empire at the cost of the lives of countless indigenous people who died in forced labour there. First exploited in the 16th century, the prodigious quantity of silver it produced stimulated a worldwide inflation and, according to some historians, thus led to capitalism itself. At its zenith, Potosi was the size of contemporary Paris, in spite of its remote location in the bleakest part of the Andean altiplano. By the 18th century the Spanish believed the mine was exhausted. Tin gave a new lease of life to the hill in the late 19th century until the tin crash in 1985 when large scale mining there came to an end. Recently, studies by private companies and by the United Nations have suggested that, far from being exhausted, there may be more silver still in the mine than was ever taken out, disseminated in half a billion tonnes of low-grade ore. The average silver concentration, 120 grams per tonne, is only marginal at today's world price, but there are known zones of much higher concentration, and other metals such as tin and zinc could be extracted simultaneously. According to experts, exploitation could be profitable even at current depressed metal prices using open-cast mining combined with modern methods of heap leaching. However, the people of Potosi and many others have vowed to resist this development tooth and nail. The principal problem is the proposed method of extraction. The mountain is not just a local, but a national symbol, imprinted on the Bolivian flag, and the town is a masterpiece of colonial architecture; both have been declared conservation sites by Unesco. Open-cast mining would not only destroy the symbol but also make the town uninhabitable by exposing it to the bitter climate of the surrounding plateau, from which the mountain currently acts as a shield. Moreover, though large-scale mining has ceased, there are over 10,000 'co-operativistas' still at work mining silver, individuals who scratch out a subsistence income using techniques 100 years out of date. Only a handful of these would be employed in an open-pit mine. Despite working in unspeakable conditions that give them life expectancies of about 35 years, they resent the potential threat to their livelihood, because they say there are simply no alternatives. One of them, Mr Florencio Quispe, says, 'the Cerro is like our mother and father. It feeds our families, and we would fight to defend it'. Because these co-operativistas' have secured partial exploitation rights to the mountain, potential investors could face a legal nightmare. The large scale investment required, estimated to be as high as Dollars 800m, is well beyond the capacity of local investors. But, despite a government eager to attract foreign investment, many Bolivian people are mindful of past exploitation and the feelings are nowhere more acute than in Potosi. Mr Carlos Vasquez, a local mining engineer, says that he would rather see the wealth stay in the ground than let foreigners 'yet again take the riches of our mountain, leaving nothing for Bolivia'. Aware of the political sensitivities, the Bolivian government is publicly coy about the future of the Cerro. But Mr Jaime Villalobos, a former minister of mines, says that Bolivia cannot afford not to develop such resources, and that with appropriate taxation, the people would benefit. 'In country that has one of the highest child mortalities in the western hemisphere, it would be criminal to neglect this opportunity.' According to Mr Villalobos, various US and Canadian corporations have quietly expressed interest in exploiting the mountain, were attitudes to change. The lure of the Cerro Rico is as strong as ever. Despite all the problems, few doubt that Bolivia will eventually succumb to the temptation of its treasures.</p>

However, Turkey has rejected the protest and drew the  attention of the Brussels Government to the preparations made  for the Kurdistan Conference in that city on 12-13 March. The  venue of the conference is in an area where many Turks live.  Belgium's protest was conveyed by the director of the Belgian  Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Political Department to Yildirim  Kesin, Turkey's ambassador in Brussels. Keskin recalled that  the decision to lift the immunity of the Democracy Party  deputies was made by the Turkish Grand National Assembly and  stressed that the Turkish Government does not have the right to  interfere in the decisions of the legislative organ, as is the  case in all countries ruled in accordance with the principles of  democracy.    According to officials affiliated with the Belgian Ministry  of Foreign Affairs, Keskin also recalled a similar situation in  that country and rejected Brussels' protest note.    Keskin also drew the Brussels Government's attention to the  preparations that are being made to hold the "International  Conference on Northwestern Kurdistan" in that city on 12-13  March. He said: "The conference, which will be held in a hotel  some 200 meters from the Turkish quarter of the city, can only  be described as a provocation. Considering the fact that the  Brussels Government has approved the conference, it will be held  responsible for this provocative activity."    Meanwhile, the HURRIYET office in Ankara has reported that  Ingela Martensan, a deputy of the Liberal Party in Sweden, has  arrived in Turkey to follow the preparations being made for the  local elections. Although Martensan does not have any official  capacity, she has criticized the election law and visited the  Democracy Party General Headquarters, which was damaged by  explosives some time ago.</p>

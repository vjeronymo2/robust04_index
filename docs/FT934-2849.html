			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Balladur's bravura balancing act: The possibility of the French prime minister facing a domestic political crisis over Gatt has diminished By giving a Gatt accord - or at least that portion of it agreed between Europe and the US - his semi-benediction, Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, has gone too far to draw back. Certainly, his domestic constituency requires him to remain more vigilant than other European leaders about tying up loose ends at Gatt's headquarters in Geneva in sectors such as textiles and aerospace. And while France remains alone on audiovisual broadcasting - the one seriously emotional dispute with the US still unresolved - Mr Balladur has always acknowledged his fear of letting Gatt isolate France from its European Union partners. That is also why, in his quest for stronger EU defences against dumping and commercial retaliatory powers, as well as for EU guarantees that a Gatt deal will not push more French farm land out of production, he must settle for whatever his partners offer. If they offer nothing, French ministers and officials still claim in private that Paris will not sign a Gatt deal. But any attempt by the French to pin the blame for a Gatt failure on fellow Europeans would risk turning France's potential isolation inside Europe into actual ostracism. By contrast, the chances of Mr Balladur facing a domestic political crisis over Gatt have sharply diminished. Furiously punching their pocket calculators, the farmers are now engaged in a numbers war with the government. The latter vaunts its success in getting the Blair House cuts phased in more gently, allowing EU farmers 8.1m more tonnes of wheat and flour to dump on the world market over the next six years, a period that covers France's 1995 presidential election. Not good enough, say the farmers, because the reduction by 2000 is unchanged from that earlier agreed with the US. Grumble though they will for months to come, however, the farmers will almost certainly not exert enough pressure on their deputies to bring down Mr Balladur in next week's parliamentary vote. Mr Balladur has virtually ensured this by making the vote one of confidence in his handling of the Gatt negotiations. And to his great relief, Mr Jacques Chirac, the RPR Gaullist party leader who is much the most dangerous mouthpiece for the farmers, has praised the government's 'intelligence and firmness' over Gatt. It has been an uphill struggle for Mr Balladur since he came into power nine months ago as head of a coalition elected partly on an anti-Gatt platform. Recently, some leaders of the centre-right UDF partner in the coalition have spoken up in favour of Gatt: ex-Prime Minister Raymond Barre and ex-President Valery Giscard d'Estaing. But Mr Barre has little real following in French politics, and Mr Giscard d'Estaing's presidency of the UDF is weakening as the party's rank and file feel drawn to Mr Balladur of the RPR. The performance of France's industrial lobby has hardly reflected the country's position as the world's fourth-largest exporter. The Patronat employers federation has been deadlocked by anti-Gatt hostility among its sub-groups in textiles, shoes, furniture and other sectors hit by imports. A few individual bosses - those of the BSN food group, the LVMH luxury goods group and AXA insurance - came out for freer world trade, but they did not form a coherent bloc. The fact that France is the second biggest seller of services abroad had raised hopes that it might campaign for Gatt. But these hopes proved misplaced, because the service sector's foreign receipts are grossly swollen by tourism, which is only indirectly affected by Gatt. With industrialists confining their pro-Gatt lobbying to back-of-hand whispers to journalists, it was not surprising that the balance of the Gatt argument in the press has, until recently, been in favour of protectionism, or at least a more ordered world market. This Gallic craving for order has led to the heavy French emphasis on the need to complete what Gatt began in 1947 with a stronger world trade organisation. Using a new world trade body to restrain the unilateralism of US administrations, and especially Congress, has been a common French and European goal. Where the French have differed from other Europeans has been in depicting so many other issues in the Uruguay Round as a struggle with the US alone. French newspaper readers have thus been shielded from the awkward knowledge that opposition to its farmers' stance has gone well beyond the US, for instance to the 14-strong Cairns Group of medium-sized food exporters, chaired by Australia. One exception was Liberation's reprint of an Australian press headline 'Foutus francais' ('The bloody French'). Only when it has been convenient have messages from the rest of the world been relayed in the press, such as that of this autumn's summit of French-speaking countries endorsing France's demand to keep culture out of Gatt. But all this general anti-Gatt sentiment is dissolving now into a national mood of compromise, for three reasons. First, Mr Balladur has deliberately helped to exhaust his co-citizens' interest in Gatt by consulting everyone in sight on the topic. More specifically, he has embraced the farmers in a regular dialogue which has produced extra public money (FFr3bn) for them, though no agreement from them. The upshot is that most of Mr Balladur's backbenchers believe the government has at least given the farmers a fair hearing, if not fair treatment. Second, Mr Balladur has helped detach trade from the unemployment issue, the country's biggest concern. He argues the main reason why 3.24m French are out of work is home-grown and related to the high cost of labour compounded by steep welfare taxes. This argument has helped to exonerate Gatt as a scapegoat for unemployment. Backing this up is a recent study by Mr Claude Vimont, a Paris university professor, that job losses in French industry that can be directly attributed to low-cost import competition amount to only 350,000 over the past 10 years. Third, France listens to voices from across the Rhine. And German industry and politicians have been quietly urging a Gatt accord on their French counterparts. Chancellor Helmut Kohl will have been telling President Francois Mitterrand and Mr Balladur the same thing in Brussels yesterday and today. The latter cannot gainsay the fact that it is the prospect of a Gatt deal that has brought the franc back up to where it was against the D-Mark before last August's monetary crisis. If Mr Balladur does finesse a Gatt agreement, putting France's signature to freer world trade without provoking a storm at home, there are several important consequences. It gives him an option to run for president in 18 months, and might even put him in the Elysee, if the French public judges he has pulled off something valuable in a way Mr Chirac could not have done. Even if he bows to Mr Chirac's more naked presidential ambitions, Mr Balladur will be seen as the man who in 1993 helped integrate his country into the world economy, just as 10 years earlier France abandoned the strategy of socialism-in-one-country and turned decisively towards Europe. By contrast, France's behaviour in the Uruguay Round has a more ominous portent for future Gatt rounds. France is determined that EU national governments and parliaments should exert far more influence on how Brussels negotiates with the outside world. This may be democratically proper and squares with the prevalent post-Maastricht treaty mood. However, it spells an end, in any future Gatt round, to the negotiating leeway that the Brussels Commission had in the Dillon, Kennedy and Tokyo Rounds, and for much of the Uruguay Round. This, in turn, will make the EU harder to deal with for the rest of the world.</p>

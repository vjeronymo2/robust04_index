			<p><P> June 6, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VATICAN TAKES LICKING ON STAMP ERROR  </P> <P> A Vatican postage stamp issued to commemorate Pope John Paul II's trip to  Scandinavia contains a mistake in Latin, the Italian news agency ANSA reported.  </P> <P> The Latin writing on the stamp was supposed to say: "John Paul the Second  Visits Norway, Iceland, Finland, Denmark and Sweden," but instead of the Latin  word for Sweden -- Svetiam -- the stamp has Svebiam, the agency reported.  Svebiam means Swabia, a region in southwest West Germany.  </P> <P> Father Carlo Eger, director of the Vatican Latin foundation's magazine,  Lattinitas, told ANSA that the mistake "is a huge error that should have been  avoided."  </P> <P> He added: "Latin, unfortunately, is on the decline even in the Vatican."  </P></p>

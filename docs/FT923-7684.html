			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Offshore switch WE HAVE funds in offshore financial organisations in Guernsey. Is it permissible to transfer these funds to another offshore financial organisation, either in Guernsey or elsewhere, and continue to defer paying income tax on the interest until the total balance is returned to the UK? You have not given us much to go on. But if neither you nor your wife is domiciled in any of the three countries of the UK, under English law, then the answer is probably yes - provided that any transfer of funds from Guernsey to somewhere else is not routed through the UK. If, on the other hand, both of you are domiciled in one of the countries of the UK (not necessarily the same one) and you are both ordinarily resident in the UK, then the answer is undoubtedly no. Furthermore, it might not be true that you are able to defer paying UK tax even if you leave the present investment intact. Many readers, unfortunately, make it difficult or impossible for us to give them as helpful a reply as we should wish because - like you - they do not give us enough precise background facts. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

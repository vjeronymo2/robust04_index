			<p><P> June 8, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> 200 SOLDIERS PAY FOR SCRATCHED CAR  </P> <P> A British army officer in West Germany confined 200 of his men to barracks for  three days after discovering a scratch on his station wagon, the Defense  Ministry said today.  </P> <P> Lt. Col. Rod Brummitt issued the order to all the unmarried soldiers under his  command at Hamer, near Dortmund, in an effort to find the man who scratched the  car.  </P> <P> The ministry was commenting on a report of the incident in the Sun newspaper  headlined "Colonel Crackpot."  </P> <P> The tabloid quoted one of Brummitt's men as saying: "The damage to his car  wasn't all that great. And why did he pick on the single soldiers (when) anyone  in the regiment could have done it?"  </P> <P> The ministry said Brummitt rescinded his order after telling the soldiers he  was disappointed that the culprit had not owned up.  </P></p>

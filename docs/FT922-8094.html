			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / International Company News: Campbell Soup up strongly STRONG volume gains in its core soups business helped Campbell Soup, the US food group, to report after-tax profits of Dollars 91.5m in the three months to April 26. This represents a 20 per cent improvement on the Dollars 76.4m seen in the same period a year earlier. Sales were up marginally, by 3 per cent, to Dollars 1.54bn. In the Campbell North America division, operating profits rose 9 per cent overall to Dollars 155.7m, the company said. Soup volumes were up 11 per cent, helped by an acquisition. Strong volume performances were registered in V8 juices and in Prego spaghetti sauces. However, frozen food sales fell sharply, as fierce price competition took its toll. The biscuit and bakery business reported an 11 per cent advance in operating profits. Campbell International saw a decline from Dollars 11.7m to Dollars 8.9m. On the international side, sales from continuing businesses were up by 3 per cent, excluding the effect of unfavourable exchange rates.</p>

			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / Arabs to focus on UN resolutions in renewed Mideast talks ARAB delegates to Middle East peace talks, which resume in Washington today, look set to focus more specifically on UN resolutions requiring Israel's withdrawal from occupied Arab land. The representatives seem certain to ask why Israel is being treated differently to Libya, which is being subjected to sanctions for failing to accept Security Council demands that it yield nationals accused of bombing western airliners. Mr Nabil Shaath, a senior Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) official and co-ordinator for the Palestinian delegation in Washington, has repeatedly accused the west of applying double standards over the Libyan affair. However, the fifth round of talks is expected to mark time in the run-up to Israeli elections on June 23. The Palestinians have already rejected Israeli proposals for municipal elections in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, accusing Mr Yitzhak Shamir, Israel's prime minister, of electioneering. They believe Mr Shamir, who is facing a strong challenge from Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Labour leader, will try to use the talks to improve his record as a peacemaker. Israel's Arab neighbours and the Palestinians are making no secret of their desire for a change of government. Mr Rabin has pledged to push ahead with plans for Palestinian autonomy in the occupied territories. Little progress has been made in four round of talks between Israel and delegations representing Syria, Lebanon and a Jordanian-Palestinian team since the US-sponsored process was launched amid much fanfare in Madrid last October. Much argument has centred on Arab demands that Israel comply with UN Security Council resolutions 242 and 338, passed after the 1967 and 1973 wars and regarded by Arabs as the basis of any Middle East settlement. Israel has been intent on deflecting discussions about 'land-for-peace' resolutions, insisting it is not interested in territorial compromise at this stage. Rather, it has attempted to discuss interim confidence-building arrangements. The US, which is pressuring the participants to begin talks of substance, has suggested that difficult subjects like the implementation of resolution 242 should be deferred until later stages of the process. But the Arabs insist that the issue forms an integral part of all discussions. Arab participants claim that the international community's reluctance to insist that Israel adhere to UN resolutions obliging it to withdraw from Arab land is undermining their credibility in the eyes of their people. However, they also recognise they are caught in a quandary over the issue of Libya and sanctions. 'How can Arab governments reject Security Council resolutions (on Libya) while they are pursuing the implementation of 242 and 338,' a Jordanian official involved in the peace talks said.</p>

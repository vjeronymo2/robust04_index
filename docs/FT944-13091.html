			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Getting dirty in Delaware: US mid-term elections, November 8 Delaware, the first state to ratify the US constitution but the second smallest in land area, rarely hits the headlines, unless they are made by a Du Pont, company or family. But, politically, this year is rather different. It is one of the very few states where a Republican incumbent, Senator Bill Roth, is in measurable danger. His defeat could mean the Democrats keep control of the Senate. His Democratic opponent, Charlie Oberly, is running a campaign lifted from the Republican anti-incumbent handbook. Perhaps most shocking of all for a state where moderation is rated a virtue, Delaware is witnessing a dirty race. Senator Roth, now 73, has been a fixture in Washington for 28 years, the last 24 in the Senate. This fits the Delaware tradition. No incumbent has been voted out of office in the last decade and Joseph Biden, the state's Democratic senator, was elected in 1972. Dour and toupeed, Mr Roth has compiled a solid record for his state and sometimes on national issues without ever being rated a political heavyweight. The Kemp-Roth tax cut proposals of the late 1970s were a precursor of Reagan administration policies, while his advocacy of personal pension plans, known in the US as independent retirement accounts, has been second to none. Mr Oberly, 47 and a three-time state attorney general, is taking aim at this longevity, calculating that national discontent with the political establishment in the capital applies to Republicans as much as it does to Democrats. He has sought to make Mr Roth's age an issue, with one commercial showing his opponent trudging along the campaign trail in slow motion. He has also recalled that early in his career Mr Roth proposed a constitutional amendment banning senators from seeking re-election after their 70th birthday (the senator put this down to 'the folly of my youth'.) The Roth counter is that the state needs a person of his seniority, 10th in the Senate, to keep 'the big spenders' of Washington in check. One of his advertisements says he would never consider ending the tax deduction on mortage interest payments - not that Mr Oberly appears to have said it should be removed. This may seem pallid stuff by the debased standards of the campaign in neighbouring Virginia, but this week Delaware has become much rougher. Mr Roth has charged that, as attorney general, Mr Oberly refused to recommend a sentence of life without parole for a murderer. Mr Oberly said that that incident, in 1990, was the result of a mix-up in legal papers presented to him and was remedied within 15 days. His campaign immediately portrayed the Roth accusation as an attempt to replay the 'Willie Horton' card - referring to the 1988 presidential election commercial that sought to portray Mr Michael Dukakis as soft on crime. This descent to the relative political gutter seems to disturb the state, according to Allan Loudell, programme director of WILM, the excellent local radio news station. There is division, however, as to who started it. Polling data only comes from the two campaigns. The senator's polls still have him ahead by more than ten points, much less in the summer, while Mr Oberly's put his deficit in single digits and declining.</p>

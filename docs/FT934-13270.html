			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Managed trade an 'assault' on system Sir, As a long-time student of the Japanese economy and a signer of the recent open letter sent by American economists to President Clinton and Prime Minister Hosokawa denouncing managed trade ('US economists attack 'myopic' trade calls', October 7), I was surprised to find C Fred Bergsten arguing in his letter (October 15) that his views on Japanese trade barriers had not changed over the past decade. That Mr Bergsten found Japan had trade barriers in the mid-1980s is hardly the issue. No one believes Japan has no trade barriers more than any serious observer believes the US or the European Community has no trade barriers. The real issue is whether Japanese barriers are so distinctive that resort to what Mr Bergsten calls 'unorthodox policy responses' like voluntary import expansions (VIEs) are necessary. On this there con be no debate about the change in Mr Bergsten's position. In the 1985 study cited in his letter, Mr Bergsten, and his colleague William Cline, found that '. . . Japan shows no special aberration of low imports that might be attributable to high but intangible protection, after taking account of country size, natural resource endowment and transportation costs. And although the share of Japanese manufactures in Japan's total imports is low, there are sound reasons of comparative advantage to expect this pattern'. Given the high regard in which he is held in policy circles throughout the world, Mr Bergsten should explain why he has changed his views, rather than strive unnecessarily for consistency. Unhappily, Mr Bergsten's recent book, Reconcilable Differences, goes so far as to neglect the research done at the Institute of International Economics by him and his colleagues which supports his earlier views. By neglecting such work, Mr Bergsten's new book gives the impression that his new views regarding trade barriers are supported by the majority of careful studies of this issue. This is not the case at all. Rather than changing his original views on Japanese trade barriers, Mr Bergsten would be better off revising his views on VIEs. Despite instruction from Professor Bhagwati's letter (August 23), Mr Bergsten still fails to grasp the analytical equivalence between VIEs and voluntary export restraints (VERs). In both cases, Japanese sales are being restrained. VIEs restrain Japanese sales in the home market. VERs restrain Japanese sales in an overseas market. In flat contradiction to what Mr Bergsten alleges, there is nothing in economics suggesting that when a home market is vacated, there will be more competition than when an overseas market is vacated. Indeed, under any reasonable assumptions about economic behaviour, VIEs, like VERs, will result in less competition and higher prices. Whether Republican (VERs) or Democratic (VIEs), managed trade is an assault on the international economic system as we know it.

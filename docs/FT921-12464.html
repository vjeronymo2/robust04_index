			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / Kashmir 'unity tour' fizzles out AS Sikh militants fired guns all day in Srinagar, the capital of Kashmir, a small group from the Hindu revivalist Bharatiya Janata party, led by its president, Mr Murli Manohar Joshi, yesterday unfurled the national flag in the Lal Chowk area of the state capital. The ceremony, intended to demonstrate the country's unity, served instead to show that the militants fighting for an independent Kashmir had the upper hand. Though Srinagar was under curfew and streets were heavily patrolled, guns crackled all day. The ceremony at which the flag was hoisted yesterday, India's Republic Day, brought to a climax Mr Joshi's 45-day ekta yatra (unity tour), which took him through 14 states at the head of a caravan of vehicles. Mr Joshi was able to accomplish the mission's final ceremony only with the connivance of the authorities. He was flown from Jammu to Srinagar on Saturday evening by the Indian Air Force when the road was declared closed, reportedly because of a landslide. The 'unity' cavalcade, in effect, ended at Jammu. The 60,000 people who were meant to accompany Mr Joshi were left behind there. In place of the planned huge gathering, the national flag was hoisted at a brief ceremony at which less than 200 were present amid the tightest security Srinagar has seen. Despite the curfew and the security, militants kept up a steady fire all day. Mr Joshi flew back to Jammu yesterday after the ceremony and survived an attempt to shoot down the aircraft carrying him.</p>

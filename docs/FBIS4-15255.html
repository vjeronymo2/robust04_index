			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Ivanova] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 6 TASS -- The Russian Mass Media  Arbitration Court warned a hard-line opposition newspaper it may  be closed if it continues to publish speculative anti-Yeltsin  articles.    The court ruled that the publication of extracts from a  novel  "Mysteries of Kremlin" by former Soviet mp Iona Andronov in the  newspaper "ZAVTRA" (TOMORROW), the successor to the notorious  "DEN", presented a violation of "the law on the press".    The court stated that in accordance with the law the  government is entitled to issue a corresponding officiial  warning to the newspaper. Two such warnings within one year are  enough to close the periodical.    The court stated that the publication was "based on absurd  conjectures" and qualified it as aimed to "destabilize the  situation in Russia and bar the signing of the memorandum on  civic peace".    The published extracts from the novel by an ardent Yeltsin's  foe alongside with bitter criticism against the Russian  president, concentrated on the most delicate theme of the  present political situation -- the state of health of the  Russian number one.</p>

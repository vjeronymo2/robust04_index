			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase): War benefits come to light I HAVE found documentary evidence (National Health &amp; pensions insurance card) that my mother was employed for some years prior to World War Two. At the moment she exists on the basic state pension. I have been told that, under certain circumstances, she may be entitled to additional benefits in her own right, but the local DHSS office has no knowledge of this type of claim. You should make enquiries of the Benefits Agency at 5 Ways Tower, Frederick Road, Edgbaston, Birmingham B15 1ST. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

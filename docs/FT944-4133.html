			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Aukett progress Despite a 'difficult and unpredictable' market, Aukett Associates, the design and architectural services group, turned in a pre-tax profit of Pounds 317,000 for the year to September 30. The result, which arose from cost controls and improved efficiency, compared with a Pounds 2.25m deficit last time, but which was after a Pounds 2.06m loss on the disposal of a discontinued operation. Work done amounted to Pounds 7.08m. This compared with Pounds 6.72m, of which Pounds 0.4m related to discontinued activities. Earnings per share were 1.81p (16.82p losses) but the dividend has again been omitted. Aukett said Mr Michael Aukett was stepping down as chief executive 'to operate his own practice outside the public arena.' Mr Andrew Lett has been appointed managing director.</p>

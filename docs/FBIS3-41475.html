According to Vasyl Hurin, doctor of technological sciences and  professor at the Ukrainian Water Management Engineers Institute,  he, jointly with his colleagues, succeeded in developing a  project that will make it possible to ``bind'' radionuclides  present in the soil by natural sorbents (available in Rivne  Oblast). As a result, the harmful elements will not be absorbed  by plants and will not be consumed, with food, by the people.    The Rivne scientists are assisted by the Chernobyl Ministry  and by corresponding oblast structures. Foreign specialists  have also shown interest. Eric Nattall, doctor of technical and  nuclear technologies [qualifications as translated] and New  Mexico University professor, arrived in Rivne. The American  expert praised the Rivne project and promised cooperation.  Local enterprises stated that if the question of implementing  the project arises, they would be willing to invest in this  important undertaking.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 2 Apr (INA)--Prime Minister Ahmad Husayn  Khudayyir has asserted that the UN Security Council is required  to lift the embargo clamped on Iraq, particularly since Iraq has  fulfilled all its commitments.    During a meeting today with Nicolas Rodriguez, under  secretary at the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Relations, the prime  minister added: Iraq has been done a flagrant and monstrous  injustice as a result of the arbitrary anti-Iraq resolutions the  UN Security Council passed under U.S. pressures. Nonetheless,  Iraq has fully honored its commitments toward these resolutions  to remove the pretexts and excuses the United States and Zionism  are using to perpetuate the unfair embargo clamped on Iraq, and  also to expose the aggressive and malicious intentions of the  evil and aggressive powers.    The prime minister went on to say: Iraq's steadfastness and  the firmness of its unique leadership, represented by his  excellency the president, have thwarted the enemies' designs and  exposed their positions even at the UN Security Council. This  has been manifested in the emergence of new trends at the UN  Security Council demanding that a new approach be used in  handling the anti-Iraq embargo, particularly since Iraq has  fully honored its commitments toward the relevant resolutions  passed against it.    Prime Minister Ahmad Husayn Khudayyir also reviewed with the  Cuban Foreign Relations Ministry official the impact of the  treacherous 30-state aggression, as well as the reconstruction  drive the Iraqis have been engaged in under His Excellency  President Saddam Husayn. He noted that the Iraqis have rebuilt  in record time the infrastructure destroyed by the evildoers.  The Iraqis have viewed the reconstruction campaign as a  counteroffensive, he added.    For his part, Nicolas Rodriguez said he hoped that friendly  bilateral ties will be promoted. He added that his current  visit to Iraq is aimed at holding consultations with Iraqi  officials to achieve this objective.</p>

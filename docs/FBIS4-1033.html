			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Stephen Laufer and John Grobler] </F>   [Text] Up to 500 former CCB [Civil Cooperation Bureau]  members and recces, headed by Lafras Luitingh -- a co-director  of Executive Outcomes, the company which recruits mercenaries  for the Angolan government -- have approached the ANC's Tokyo  Sexwale pledging support for an ANC-led administration in South  Africa.    The move indicates a significant split within the ranks of  the former Civil Co-operation Bureau, the special forces killer  commando which has been linked to the deaths of anti-apartheid  activists. Another group of CCB operatives appears to have  allied itself to the ultra rightwing. Luitingh told SABC's  [South African Broadcasting Corporation] MONITOR this week his  group had "no problem with the ANC. Although we won't join the  new defence force, we will work for the new government if asked."    A Uitingh associate said the group knew "we won't have  problems with the ANC because we are supporting the MPLA  [Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola]." Confirming  the contacts, Sexwale said Luitingh had "come to us in  confidence, but not in secrecy. I passed them on to our  intelligence department, which is in contact with them." The  ANC had been in touch with the Angolan government which had  "confirmed the group was involved in guarding oil installations  in Soyo."    Asked why he had been approached, Sexwale said: "I am not  the head of the ANC's cultural department and these are not  cultural workers. Everyone knows of my military background: I  suppose they felt I was the right person to talk to." Executive  Outcomes has denied its employees -- mainly former special  forces and 32 Batallion soldiers -- have been involved in combat  against UNITA [Popular Movement for the Total Liberation of  Angola] forces, but announnced last week that four had been  killed in reconnaisance missions in northern Angola. Former  Namibian rugby player and 5 Recce [Reconnaissance] member Steyn  Marais was killed a week earlier in an operation Executive  Outcomes termed an "investigation into criminal activities".  This is understood to mean Marais was involved in military  activities against illegal diamond mining in the mineral- rich  Lunda Norte diamond fields controlled by UNITA. Besides the  Angolan government, De Beers is understood to have shown an  interest in staunching the flow on to world markets of Angolan  diamonds beyond its control.    UNITA has financed its war against the Angolan government  through diamond sales since losing the official backing of the  United States and South Africa in the settlement which led to  elections last year. Savimbi returned to his bush war after  losing the elections. As increasing numbers of Luitingh recruits  appear to be dying in Angola, the war of words with the  "unreconstructed" faction within the former Recces has heated  up. Former 32 Batallion commander Colonel Jan Breytenbach  accused Executive Outcomes of luring people to their death with  false promises of security work at U$10,000 a month.    Sexwale had played a central role in facilitating contracts  between Luitingh and the Angolan army, charged Breytenbach.  "That's absolute junk," said Sexwale. "I would be proud to  help organise the defence of the revolution and of democracy in  Angola, but the fact is I had nothing to do with it. Luitingh's  group was involved in Angola before they came to see me."    Sexwale said he had been to Angola once and, although he had  wanted to see what Luitingh's people were doing there because it  would give an indication of their readiness to serve a new  South Africa, he had been unable to meet them. "You are seeing  mercenaries playing another role today. Eventually all these  people who want to play a role, can. But they must accept the  principle of reconciliation which is that you cannot forgive  want you don't know."    Sexwale's stance may mean reconciliation is still a long way  off. Luitingh told MONITOR he would prefer the CCB's criminal  activities to be forgotted. "Both the ANC and the CCB were  responsible for terrible things," he said.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Board does note that account closure for credit unions does not necessarily occur in the same manner as for other depository institutions. A member may voluntarily close an account by actively terminating membership in a credit union. For instance, under the Standard FCU Bylaws, Art. II, &sect;4, a member who withdraws all of his shareholdings ceases to be a member. The membership of a member may also be terminated by action of the credit union. For instance, a member may be expelled by majority vote of the membership under Standard FCU Bylaws, Art. XVI (and 12 U.S.C. 1764(a)); or an FCU may terminate a member's membership if the board of directors has adopted a nonparticipation policy, which has been publicized to the membership (12 U.S.C. 1764(b)); or if a member falls outside of the credit union's field of membership (e.g., the member moves out of the geographical coverage of a community-based credit union), unless the credit union has adopted a ``once a member, always a member'' policy under Standard FCU Bylaws, Art. II, &sect;5. If a member merely lets the membership share account drop below the stated par value, neither the membership nor the account of the member are terminated. Standard FCU Bylaws, Art. III, &sect;3; NCUA Letter to Credit Unions No. 70 (November 29, 1982). Under the Standard FCU Bylaws, once an account is closed, and the membership terminated, both the membership and the account must be reestablished. Therefore, the ``closed account'' guidance adopted by the NCUA Board conforming to that of the FRB applies only to accounts closed by the member or the credit union in conformance with applicable federal or state law. This clarification is made in comment 4(a)(1)&hyph;1. This clarification agrees with guidance provided in the preamble to the final part 707. 58 FR 50394 at 50414 (September 27, 1994). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comment 4(a)(1)&hyph;2 clarifies that an institution acquiring accounts through a merger or acquisition is not required to provide new account disclosures. However, such accounts are required to calculate dividends by either the daily or average daily balance method; comply with &sect;707.5(a)(1) if it chooses to change terms of the acquired account; and follow the periodic statement requirements, if applicable. As the accounts are no longer offered, no advertising rules should ever be triggered. NCUA does note that certain term share accounts no longer currently offered may require new account disclosures if they are nonrollover or if new account disclosures would be required under &sect;707.5. Private merger and purchase of asset and shares transactions are distinguishable, however, from acquisitions or mergers involving the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF). In a government-assisted acquisition, the acquiring institution receives only the member's funds on account. The account contract or other legal obligation_the terms and conditions of the account such as fees_stays (and ultimately terminates) with the failed credit union. Thus, new account disclosures must be provided if the member chooses to open an account with the new institution. Also, if fees are imposed before the new account relationship is established, the fee must be disclosed prior to imposition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two national trade association commenters, as well as fourteen other commenters, requested that a clarification be issued regarding guidance in proposed comment 4(a)(1)&hyph;1. Two commenters requested that the provision be deleted as unnecessary and confusing. NCUA had proposed that if a member were to open separate subaccounts from a main account and if the terms were identical to that of the main account, that new disclosures would not have to be provided to the member. The commenters noted that the terms of an account will rarely be ``identical'' to those of a subaccount. The Board agrees with the commenters, therefore the proposed comment (now comment 4(a)(1)&hyph;3) has been amended to reflect that new disclosures need not be provided if the credit union has already provided combined disclosures for the main and subaccount within a reasonable time of when the subaccount is opened and the applicable disclosures are still accurate when the subaccount is opened. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (a)(2) Requests <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a)(2)(i) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As requested by a national trade association commenter, comment 4(a)(2)(i)&hyph;1 clarifies that institutions are not required to send new account disclosures for accounts no longer offered to the public. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A national trade association requested that NCUA offer credit unions the choice of offering members and potential members either account disclosures or rate sheets in responses to requests for disclosures under &sect;707.4(a)(2). Since the rule only permits account disclosures to be provided upon request, and the proposed rulemaking concerned only Appendix C, the commentary to part 707, the commenter's request is beyond the scope of this rulemaking. The Board would violate the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act to consider such an amendment in this final rule. Also, as no credit union uniqueness arguments were presented, the NCUA Board does not believe that even if such request were within the scope of this rulemaking, that it would adopt such an amendment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (a)(2)(ii)(A) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Comment 4(a)(2)(ii)(A)(2)&hyph;1 clarifies that when responding to a request for disclosures by giving rates ``accurate within the most recent seven calendar days,'' institutions should calculate the time period from the date the institution sends the disclosure. This clarification is based upon a similar change made in the final Regulation DD commentary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

But that is no reason to be discouraged. Prime ministers  under the Liberal Democratic Party government did not fare much  better either. If Japanese were asked to name the prime  minister of Norway, the country where the winter Olympics is to  be held, what percentage of them could give the correct answer?    U.S. understanding of Japan, particularly with respect to  politics, is of about that degree. But that is where Prime  Minister Hosokawa is going today, 10 February, to attend the  third summit meeting.    The eastern United States are currently suffering from a  cold  wave. However, the atmosphere in Washington, where the prime  minister will be received, is said to be colder still. The  reason, almost needless to say, is because of deadlocked  negotiations over the question of setting numerical targets on  imports of U.S. automobiles and auto parts into Japan.    Japan insists it can never accept such targets, the United  States counters with, "It would be better to have no agreement  than to have one without numbers in it." Battles at the working  level are continuing with no end in sight, like parallel lines  that will never meet.    This is the fourth Japan-U.S. summit meeting in less than a  year since the Clinton government came to power. It was in  April last year that both sides agreed to hold new economic  framework talks. Subsequently it was agreed in July that the  forum of the comprehensive economic consultations should be  instituted and that progress on consultations should be  announced at the summit meeting to be held six months later.    It was an agreement made by the Miyazawa government.  However, since then Prime Minister Hosokawa has met President  Clinton twice, and has declared that his administration will try  to fulfill the agreement. That being the given condition, the  economy-oriented President has tried his best not to put the  prime minister in a difficult position, and to back him up  openly displaying his friendliness. There is no doubt that this  time the President will ask the prime minister to return the  favor.    As far as we can see, news media in the United States have  conspicuously encouraged the President on the issue of setting  numerical targets. THE NEW YORK TIMES said: "The President is  about to take appropriate action."    U.S. public opinion is right now boiling on the question of  bombing former Yugoslavia. If there is any topic of concern as  far as Asia is concerned, it might be nuclear development in the  DPRK (North Korea). That being the case, there are, among  Japanese working-level officials, some who feel that a serious  situation can be avoided somehow by putting off a decision on  the matter.    That would not be a wise choice. Postponing matters is an  old trick used by Japan in previous negotiations with the United  States. As Washington sees it, the issue boils down to a trade  deficit with Japan running to more than $50 billion a year.  President Clinton thinks there is no more room for compromise  and no choice but to force numbers on Japan.    Kunihiko Saito, vice minister of foreign affairs, said:  "Expectations of the Hosokawa government having been so great,  the impact of betrayal by it will be enormous."    He also warned: "If we bungle this, Japan-U.S. relations  could become the worst they have been since the end of the war."    Confrontations between the bureaucrats of Japan and the  United States now are such that there appears to be no way out.  There is no other way but for the President and the prime  minister to make a political decision.    The prime minister keeps talking about making "a decision at  the last moment." That was what happened on the rice issue, the  political reform bills, and reform of the taxation system. It  looks certain now that he will have to make another "decision at  the last moment."    This time, however, the issue is how far he can go over the  heads of the bureaucrats. But this is what the Clinton  administration and the U.S. news media are hoping will happen.    We are concerned lest his 1-percent recognition in the  United  States shoot up as a result of him becoming notorious.</p>

			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Finance and the Family: Borrow at your peril . . . The wrong current account can be expensive, says a report in the latest Which?, magazine of the Consumers' Association (CA). A Pounds 300 overdraft over three months would cost Pounds 61 with the Clydesdale Bank - but less than Pounds 7 with the Alliance &amp; Leicester or Woolwich building societies. Overdraft charges on bank accounts often are expressed as fixed fees rather than percentages. If you overdraw by just a small amount, though, a fixed fee of Pounds 50 or so can translate into an astronomical annual percentage rate (APR). Which? suggests switching to one of the current accounts that charge no fees when you overdraw by agreement: Abbey National, Alliance &amp; Leicester, First Direct (up to Pounds 250), Halifax, Nationwide and Woolwich. Credit cards are a cheaper way to borrow larger amounts or for more than a few days - but make sure you have the right one. Those issued by the high street banks are not usually the best value, with interest rates typically between 21 and 24 per cent. Save &amp; Prosper is increasing the interest rate on its Visa and Mastercards from 0.95 per cent a month (APR 13.9) to 1 per cent (APR 14.6) from December 1, but they are still some of the better-value cards around. Other credit cards with APRs under 20 per cent include Bank of Cyprus, Coutts, the GM Card, Leeds Permanent, MBNA, N&amp;P, and Royal Bank of Scotland. If you do not borrow regularly, avoid cards with annual fees as well as the Royal Bank of Scotland, which charges interest from the date of purchase even if you clear the balance in full. Fee-free cards like the GM Card, MBNA and N&amp;P are best for occasional borrowers.</p>

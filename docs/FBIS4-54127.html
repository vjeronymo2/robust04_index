			<p>BFN     [Text] An agreement was reached at the Uruguay Round (new  multilateral trade negotiations of the GATT) to liberalize  imports of milk products. In this regard, it has been disclosed  that the Japanese Government reached "secret accords" with  United States and Australia, in deciding to import amounts of  certain products which the United States and Australia produce  more of than do other countries, in the face of the  liberalization. The accords will be linked to giving priority  to actual purchases of certain milk products from both  countries. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries  [MAFF] denies the allegation, saying that "we did not promise  that we would import the goods from both countries." However, it  is believed that the secret accords are de facto "import  guarantees." Therefore, it is expected that other milk-product  exporting nations will voice opposition.    So far the Livestock Industry Promotion Corporation [LIPC]  has imported all types of milk products, including butter and  skim milk, to satisfy domestic demand. Following the Uruguay  Round agreement, importers will be able to freely import milk  products starting in 1995 if they pay high tariffs. At the same  time, the LIPC will be allowed to import 137,202 tons of milk  products annually with low tariffs as part of minimum access.    Of the LIPC's import quota, 20,000 to 30,000 tons will be  allocated to a milk product called whey, which is used in bread  and confections, according to the accord with the United States  which was agreed to last year at the bilateral Japan-U.S. talks.  Because the United States is strongly competitive in the  production of whey, the agreement may become a de facto  guarantee for its import from the United States. According to  the MAFF, Japan has not imported whey from the United States  since 1988.    Japan promised Australia in March that it would import  butter  and skim milk from that country in amounts equivalent to at  least three-fourths of the LIPC's total imports of butter and  skim milk. Japan and Australia have exchanged an informal  document that stipulates: 1) Japan will decide on the import  volume of butter and skim milk every year after considering the  domestic demand, and 2) Japan and Australia will hold  governmental dairy product negotiations every year and exchange  information on the milk products trade. It can be said that the  informal document is a de facto guarantee for imports from  Australia. The MAFF, however, has never made public the  informal document.    Commenting on the secret accord concluded between Japan and  the United States, a Japanese official in charge of the Uruguay  Round negotiations said, "Japan and the United States agreed at  the end of their negotiations on opening the Japanese rice  market to postpone implementation of rice `tariffication,' and  Japan has conceded to the United States on whey."    In principle, GATT bans country-by-country import quotas,  but  it permits the import quota system if all nations involved agree  on the import quota system. As for the secret Japan-U.S. accord  and the secret Japan-Australia accord, the MAFF has not notified  GATT of them, and the MAFF says, "The accords do not constitute  a country-by-country import quota."</p>

			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Sweden's polar region thaws over EU deal: Opposition to European Union membership is softening as the deadline for agreement approaches 'This,' said the aide to Sweden's conservative Prime Minister Carl Bildt as he flew into the Arctic, 'is an away match.' Heading for the small town of Gallivare, 60 miles inside the polar circle, to campaign for Swedish membership of the European Union, Mr Bildt was braced for a reception as icy as the sub-zero winter weather. The area, like most of Sweden's far north, is both a bastion of support for his chief political opponents, the Social Democrats, and of hostility to the EU. In the event, little stirred in the two meetings hosted by Mr Bildt - one of about 400 school students, the other a town meeting of 150 people. Even the prime minister's assertion that 'We are part of Europe  - we cannot clip ourselves out of the map' drew sceptical questions rather than discernable enthusiasm. A series of opinion polls in Sweden and neighbouring Finland and Norway suggest that opposition to joining the union is softening, just as negotiations with Brussels on the terms for membership come to the crunch - the deadline set for completion is March 1. The latest polls in Finland reflect the fear of rising nationalism in neighbouring Russia, with opposition faltering, to as low as 30 per cent, and support above 40 per cent. A series of negotiated decisions in December, on issues such as preserving high local environmental standards, have seen support for membership in Sweden strengthen to more than 30 per cent, with the 'no' side slipping to 40 per cent. And in Norway, opposition has fallen below 50 per cent for the first time in months, with support rising to above 35 per cent. All three countries - along with fellow applicant Austria - have promised a referendum later this year to decide the issue. On the flight back to Stockholm from Gallivare, Mr Bildt was reluctant to interpret his placid reception as a sign of shifting opinion, but he did believe feelings had become less entrenched. 'They are now listening very carefully to the arguments - people are more accessible than before - but there is still a long way to go.' Mr Sten Birger Grundstrom, headmaster of the Gallivare school visited by the prime minister, said he felt opposition among his pupils - many of whom will be old enough to vote in the referendum - was weakening. 'As they learn more they become less hostile.' Opposition to membership swirls around a number of issues in Gallivare. Will the remote areas lose out on the generous regional and agricultural subsidies they have enjoyed? Will national sovereignty be undermined? Will foreigners flood an overcrowded job market and tourists trample the countryside? Will the Nordic way of life - the welfare system - be dismantled at Brussels' behest? Mr Grundstrom says for young people, facing 30 per cent youth unemployment in parts of Sweden and Finland, much depends on the health of the domestic economy. 'This definitely influences them on the EU question. They link it to the other things they are unhappy about, such as unemployment. If the economy really improves, as it looks like it will this year, then so will opposition to the EU fall.' A lot will turn on whether the applicant countries win accession agreements over the next week which they can present as favourable. Even then, there are plenty who remain adamantly opposed to membership. 'The EU is about centralisation of power,' declared Ms Mona Larsson, a former hotel administration manager in Gallivare who is now unemployed. 'Brussels will get stronger and stronger, it is inevitable. The EU is like a ship being built in sections. Soon it will be put together and it will be controlled by the bridge. It is better that Sweden stays independent.'</p>

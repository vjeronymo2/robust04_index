			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Former Supreme Soviet Chairman Stanislav  Shushkevich in an interview to INTERFAX has spoken in favor of  creating an electoral bloc of democratic forces in the republic.  According to the ex-speaker, this bloc could consist of various  social and political organizations, including the oppositional  Belarusian Popular Front. Having suggested that he will  actively participate in the formation of such a bloc,  Shushkevich stated that for the time being, he does not intend  to create a party of his own. It is necessary to urge early  parliamentary elections, which were promised by the Supreme  Soviet to the people some time ago, noted the ex-speaker.</p>

The Transcarpathian, Crimean, Ciscarpathian, Poltava, Lugansk,  Kherson, and Zaporozhye oblasts have been deemed possible sites  for the use of geothermal energy. According to scientists'  estimates, the potential geothermal energy resources of these  areas can support the operation of (1) geothermal power plants  with a total capacity of as much as 230 million kW assuming well  depths up to 7 km and (2) a geothermal heating system with a  total capacity of as much as 1,370 million kW assuming wells up  to 4 km deep. It should be noted that these are cautious  estimates that have been made after studying about 15 percent of  all potential sites. The Transcarpathian Oblast has been  determined to be especially promising for the development of  geothermal power generation. In the said oblast, rock at depths  up to 6 km has7 temperatures ranging from 230 to 275C. Four  extensive territories (total area, 330-380 km[.sup]2[/]) with  an elevated geothermal gradient have been identified in the  Transcarpathian Oblast. Ukraine still lags behind foreign  countries from the standpoint of developments related to  intensive extraction of the heat of heated rocks located deep  below the earth's surface. Several underground circulation  systems have been considered along with possible designs for a  geothermal power plant that includes a geothermal circulation  system. Special attention is being paid to the combined use of  low-potential heat and heat obtained by burning fuel, which is  estimated to result in an efficiency of 40-70 percent depending  on the end temperature of the coolant discharged from the system  and the initial temperature of the thermal water. The best  systems currently achieve temperatures of 35-45C. The use  of heat pumps in geothermal heating systems will make it  possible to reduce this temperature to 5-10C, and an  initial coolant temperature of 70-80C will make it possible  to double the intensity of the heat extraction process. A  computer program has been developed to perform 10 sequential  calculations to determine the technical and economic feasibility  of proposed geothermal power plants. According to the program,  given the elevated geothermal gradient encountered in Ukraine  (i.e., 22-25 m/), the optimum coolant temperature would be  190-220C, which translates into a circulation zone depth of  5.0-5.5 km. Given current prices for electricity produced at  nuclear power plants and state regional electric power plants, a  geothermal power plant constructed in regions with an elevated  geothermal gradient (i.e., &lt;20 m/) would be competitive  in  today's market. After the year 2000, even geothermal power  plants constructed in regions with average geothermal gradients  (i.e., &gt; 25 m/) would be competitive with nuclear and  state  regional electric power plants. The operating modes and process  equipment of experimental geothermal power plants in Ukraine  remain to be worked out. Construction of commercial geothermal  power plants may begin thereafter (beginning in 1993-1994) in  areas with high geothermal gradients. Figures 5; references 6  (Russian).</p>

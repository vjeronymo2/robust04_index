			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Abu Dhabi still bitter about BCCI closure MORE than 12 months after the closure of Bank of Credit and Commerce International, Abu Dhabi, its biggest shareholder and creditor, is feeling confident enough to face direct questions about its role. Mr Ahmed al-Sayegh, a member of the working group established by the majority shareholders to negotiate with Touche Ross, the liquidators, has emerged as the emirate's spokesman at time when both Abu Dhabi and Touche Ross are anxious to obtain the support of creditors for the Dollars 1.7bn (Pounds 880m) compensation agreement they negotiated over eight months. Yesterday he gave his first interview. It was at an informal lunch, although he was flanked by two lawyers, at the London offices of Simmons and Simmons which acts for the majority shareholders. Mr al-Sayegh, a director of the Abu Dhabi National Oil company, said the emirate was fully committed to the compensation deal. 'We believe the contribution package is a fair agreement,' he said. 'No one else has come up with a viable alternative. We hope the depositors when consulted feel the same way.' He said that Mr Brian Smouha, the Touche Ross accountant in overall charge of the liquidation, had been a tough bargainer who had won the respect and co-operation of the working group. 'We decided not to walk away from Mr Smouha,' Mr al-Sayegh said. 'If we had decided to walk away from him we could have made his life difficult, but we didn't walk away. We decided to work with him because we decided it was in the best interests of the depositors and creditors.' Abu Dhabi had already sought to help depositors by working with the Bank of England on the interim compensation scheme. He pointed out that Abu Dhabi had paid for professional councillors for those BCCI employees in the UK who had lost their jobs in the closure. More than 50 per cent of those put out of work had found new jobs. It was clear the emirate remains bitter about the way BCCI was closed after restructuring negotiations had reached an advanced stage. Mr al-Sayegh said that before the closure in July last year BCCI had been a 'valuable asset with a new owner, new management and new capital'. He added: 'I still think that if it was not for the closure we could have still operated the bank.' He admitted that Abu Dhabi had been told in April 1990 by Mr Swaleh Naqvi, the former chief executive of BCCI, that deposits belonging to Sheikh Zayed al-Nahyan, the ruler of Abu Dhabi and president of the United Arab Emirates, had been misappropriated, but said that this did not amount to a confession. 'We didn't get evidence for this, we didn't get records, we didn't get anything.' He said that Mr Naqvi at that time had lacked credibility. Mr Naqvi is among 17 senior Abu Dhabi executives detained in Abu Dhabi since the closure. Formal charges have yet to be laid, but preliminary charges of fraud have been laid against 14 of the men. Mr al-Sayegh hinted that it would take some years to bring a case to court. 'It took four years in Guinness to bring a case, which is much simpler than in BCCI.' He stressed that Abu Dhabi was committed to presenting a case. 'We are the biggest victims, we have lost billions of dollars, our laws have been violated, our reputation has been damaged, so we cannot let this pass without proper investigation or a proper prosecution.' He added: 'We are going to go after everybody who has conned us.'</p>

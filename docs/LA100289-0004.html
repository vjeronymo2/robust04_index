			<p><P> October 2, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Thousands of supporters of the late dictator Ferdinand E. Marcos marched  through Manila demanding that President Corazon Aquino allow his body to be  buried in the Philippines. Meanwhile, Aquino -- who barred the return on  grounds that this might spark civil disorder -- said on her weekly radio  program that she will follow any Philippine Supreme Court order to allow the  return of Marcos' body but is confident the justices will support her ban.  Attorneys for Marcos said they will file a motion today asking the Supreme  Court to reconsider its Sept. 15 decision dismissing a petition to allow Marcos  to come home.  </P></p>

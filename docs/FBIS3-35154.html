The talks began with a private meeting between Dr. Nabil  Sha'th, political adviser to Palestinian President Yasir  'Arafat, and General Amnon Shahaq, Israeli deputy chief of  staff, to draw up the agenda of the talks.    Afterward, the meeting of the Security Affairs Committee  began under Dr. Sha'th and General Shahaq. The Civilian Affairs  Committee also met under attorney Jamil al-Tarifi representing  the Palestinian side and Gadi Zohar representing the Israeli  side.    Ya'qov Neriah, political adviser to Israeli Prime Minister  Yitzhaq Rabin, is participating in the talks for the first time.    Palestinian sources said Y'aqov Neriah's participation in  the  talks means the Israeli side is serious about reaching an  agreement on the points of differences still under discussion.  The sources noted the positive atmosphere and the great  progress made during the last round of talks in Taba.    Hasan 'Asfur and Y'aqov Neriah told journalists that the  talks will be held in secret and that the press will not be  allowed to cover them. The Palestinian and Israeli negotiators  will hold intensive talks until Wednesday, when Sha'th and  Shahaq will announce the results at a news conference.</p>

			<p><P> March 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLAN DISCLOSED FOR 3 COUNTY RAIL LINES;  </P> <P> TRANSPORTATION: COMPETING PROJECTS WOULD ALL BE BUILT OVER NEXT 11 YEARS IF  VOTERS APPROVE JUNE BALLOT MEASURES, PLANNERS SAY.  </P> <P> Confident that voters will approve billions of dollars in transportation  spending measures in June, Los Angeles County rail planners on Friday unveiled  a plan to build three competing rail projects -- a San Fernando Valley  extension of the downtown Metro Rail, a downtown-to-Pasadena line and a rail  spur to Los Angeles International Airport -- over the next 11 years.  </P> <P> If the $2.2-billion construction plan is approved later this month by the  County Transportation Commission, it would head off a bruising fight among the  Valley, the northeast Los Angeles-Pasadena area and the airport area over which  one would get the next rail line.  </P> <P> However, in addition to assuming that California voters will add nine cents to  the gasoline tax on June 5 and approve the sale of $2 billion in rail bonds,  the plan requires that cities that would benefit from the new lines, especially  Los Angeles, come up with $309 million.  </P> <P> Neil Peterson, commission executive director, said that if voters do not  approve the ballot measures, "we don't have a contingency plan. . . . If the  propositions don't pass, it wipes out this program."  </P> <P> Commissioners admitted to being pleasantly surprised at the possibility they  might not have to choose between the three rival projects, each of which has  enthusiastic advocates.  </P> <P> "I don't know of any commissioner who has been looking forward to a fight,"  said Commissioner Jackie Bacharach,  </P> <P> Bacharach, who heads the commission's Rail Construction Committee, called  Peterson's plan a "fantastic concept" but said she would "have to study it more  before I'm convinced it will work."  </P> <P> The Rancho Palos Verdes councilwoman said she is becoming optimistic about the  June 5 ballots "because no opposition seems to be forming. But remember that  under this plan, we also have to have financial help from local officials."  </P> <P> However, Los Angeles City Councilman Nate Holden, who chairs the council's  Transportation Committee, Friday promptly rejected any new city contribution,  saying, "We've given enough to the Metro Rail and we're already on the line for  any cost overruns in the future."  </P> <P> Holden said he planned to pressure the commission "to start work on the Valley  line immediately and let the others follow."  </P> <P> He predicted that a majority of the council, which has leverage with the  commission because it is paying part of the $4-billion cost of building Metro  Rail from downtown to North Hollywood, would support that strategy.  </P> <P> The commission's Transit Committee is to take up the plan Monday and the full  commission is expected to vote on it March 28.  </P> <P> The proposed Valley project, which has a $1.1-billion price tag, is a 5.6-mile  extension of the downtown-to-North Hollywood Metro Rail subway westward to the  San Diego Freeway at Oxnard Street in Van Nuys.  </P> <P> The line would be built in the Southern Pacific railroad freight right of way  that crosses the Valley parallel to Chandler and Victory boulevards and, in a  concession to vocal homeowners, would be underground in residential areas of  North Hollywood.  </P> <P> The downtown-to-Pasadena project, costing $925 million, would employ the same  equipment as the nearly completed ground-level Long Beach-Los Angeles  light-rail line, scheduled to be in operation in July. The Pasadena line, which  would serve Chinatown and Highland Park, would connect to the Metro Rail subway  at Union Station.  </P> <P> The 2.5-mile Los Angeles airport spur, expected to cost an estimated $137  million, would be an extension of the Century Freeway light-rail line northward  from its western terminus in El Segundo.  </P> <P> The line, which will employ the same futuristic computer-controlled rail cars  as the Century Freeway line, would cut across the airport's Lot C en route to a  terminus in Westchester.  </P> <P> Peterson and his staff recommended against extending the system three miles  more to Marina del Rey, saying that would add little to the line's ridership.  </P> <P> As proposed by the commission staff, construction of the coast line would begin  next year and be completed when the Century Freeway line opens in 1994.  </P> <P> Construction of the downtown-to-Pasadena line would begin in 1993 and be  completed in 1998.  </P> <P> Work on the Valley Metro Rail segment would start in 1996 and be finished in  2001, the same year that the subway is to reach North Hollywood from downtown.  </P> <P> Of the $2.2-billion cost for the three projects, $1.2 billion would come from  the two transportation propositions on the June ballot which also would finance  freeway construction and local road improvements. Also, $309 million would come  from local cities and $700 million would be from the extra half-cent sales tax  that Los Angeles County voters approved in 1980.  </P> <P> The two light rail projects already under way -- the Century Freeway and Long  Beach-Los Angeles lines -- as well as the local share of the downtown Metro  Rail, are being financed with the sales tax receipts.  </P> <P> Should Los Angeles refuse to contribute to the construction of three lines, the  commission staff suggested that stations might be eliminated from the Pasadena  line or some portions of the line might be single-track, a configuration that  often slows service because trains must pull onto sidings while others go  through.  </P></p>

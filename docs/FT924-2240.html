			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / Arts: Scandinavian song - Concert The time when the only Scandinavian song we ever heard was Grieg's 'With a waterlily' sung in German by Elisabeth Schwarzkopf suddenly seems a long way off. Over the past month the 'Tender is the North' festival has inaugurated a virtual single market for songs, in which the music of Northern composers has won an equal hearing alongside that of their continental counterparts. On Thursday it was the turn of Soile Isokoski, a young Finnish soprano too little known in this country. I first heard Miss Isokoski as a Valkyrie in Amsterdam, but for her Wigmore Hall recital she had laid her spear and helmet aside. It is the rounded and pure beauty of the sound that is her prime gift, fine for the Mozart heroines she sings on stage, but also warm and succulent in Berg's Seven Early Songs. Like the other sopranos in this festival, she gave us the inevitable Grieg waterlily, floating in her performance over an undercurrent of urgent anxiety. But that degree of intensity in her singing was unusual. Among her Schubert songs, one of the best was 'Nacht und Traume', where the voice showed that it could grow in volume and pressure, while sounding just as relaxed as before. Overall there was a lack of variety, which the beauty of the singing did its best to mask. The Four Dream Songs by Aulis Sallinen, Finland's most feted living composer, had a special nocturnal loveliness. The accompaniments, evocatively played by Marita Viitasalo, are made up of eerie sounds overlapping each other in soft focus to set up the dream-like atmosphere, while the voice sings above. Throughout the festival another voice has been introducing the Scandinavian songs. This is Elisabeth Soderstrom, recently-retired Swedish soprano, who has preceded each of the recitals with a talk on what the evening's singer is about to deliver. On Tuesday last, however, Thomas Allen cancelled at the last moment and she discovered that she was introducing herself. At a moment like this a long and varied career into which to delve is invaluable. Soderstrom, expertly accompanied by Roger Vignoles, gave us probably the most far-reaching programme of all: Sjogren, Nielsen, Peterson-Berger, Kilpinen, Linde, and Rangstrom. The last - Rangstrom has been one of the discoveries of this festival - composed two of the singer's favourite songs, including the bleak but tender 'Den enda stunden'. For once, Grieg's waterlily was left in peace. Recitals sponsored by British Airways and Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken</p>

			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Problems piling up for Caribbean sugar sector - A wave of labour unrest is adding to the woes of a struggling industry, writes Canute James A WAVE of industrial unrest in the Caribbean sugar industry has compounded earlier problems caused by falling production and changes in important markets. Exporters are having difficulty in retaining traditional markets and no new ones are available; some export quotas have been reduced while some export commitments are not being fulfilled. The pain is most evident in Barbados, for which the sugar industry is a relatively small but important pillar of the troubled economy. An eight-week strike that delayed the start of this year's harvest has reduced production at a time when the financially strapped industry has been trying to catch its breath. The industry was shut down late last year because it ran out of money. The privately-owned Barbados Sugar Industry Ltd, which operates the island's mills, owes a state-owned bank about USDollars 87m. New money has not been available because the government is under pressure to reduce state spending. It took a loan of Pounds 5m from Barclays Bank of the UK to get the industry up on its feet again, but preparations by millers to start processing cane in January were frustrated by a strike. Unions demanded an increase in wages but the millers said they were unable to pay because of their weak finances. It took the intervention of the country's prime minister to break the impasse. The industry is forecasting production of 50,000 tonnes for this year, which will not be enough to meet its quotas to the European Community and the US while satisfying domestic demand, for which about 73,000 tonnes would be needed. Failure to fill export quotas has also been a major worry for the Guyanese sugar industry. In each of the past three years the country has pleaded force majeure on scheduled shipments to the European Community as production has faltered because of strikes and poor weather. The industry expects to meet its EC quota of 167,000 tonnes this year although production was only 155,000 tonnes last year, 25,000 tonnes more than in 1990. Like other countries that fear a loss of their quotas if they do not meet the supply schedules, Guyana and Barbados may be forced to import sugar for the domestic market. 'The logic here is quite simple,' explains a Jamaican trade official. 'The preferential markets such as the EC pay more than the exporters would get on the world market. So they ensure they meet their quotas and then buy cheaply on the world market for domestic consumption. The EC and the US do not like this practice, but it is done fairly often.' In Guyana and Barbados efforts are being made to improve the management of the sugar industry and raise productivity. Booker Tate, a subsidiary of Booker of the UK, is managing the state-owned industry in Guyana, and will begin running the Barbados industry later this year. The marginal improvement in output by the Jamaican industry over the past two years was halted by a two-week strike at the island's nine mills that ended this week. This year's target of 230,000 tonnes, if it is achieved, will allow the island to meet its quota commitments. The administrators of the industry in the Caribbean complain that region's marketing and production plans are being adversely affected by changing conditions in important markets, such as the US, where adjustments to import quotas are frequent. In the current crop year, for example, most of the Caribbean producers have had their US quota cut by 35 per cent, and others by 10 per cent. These changes, which are influenced mainly by the level of domestic US production, are expected to reduce the Caribbean region's earnings by about USDollars 70m. The reduction is hitting hardest in the Dominican Republic, where industry has been in decline for the past decade. The cut of 35 per cent in its US quota to 232,500 tonnes this year might have been less painful had it not been for uncertainty over another valuable market. The Dominicans had been supplying between 50,000 tonnes and 225,000 tonnes a year to the Soviet Union. But with the break-up of the union Dominican industry officials and bankers say there is uncertainty about future of sales to the Commonwealth of Independent States, as it is now called. Like most of the other Caribbean producers, production costs in the Dominican Republic, which produced 628,000 tonnes last year, exceed world market prices. Strikes and production costs are not likely to be among the problems facing the sugar sector in Cuba, the region's largest producer. Since the break-up of the Soviet Union, which was the island's major market, short term contracts with members of the CIS have brought some relief. But a significant reduction in output is likely this year because of a late start to harvesting and a shortage of fuel which has overtaken the embattled economy. There are indications that output this year will be about 1m tonnes less than last year's 7.6m tonnes. The US industry, however, is already weighing the consequences of the changes in Cuba's markets, with suggestions that this could leave the island with millions of tonnes to dispose of on the world market. Depression of prices would be compounded by a likely loss of market for some of Cuba's neighbours, particularly if there were political changes on the island. 'In a post-Castro Cuba, the US would try to assist a new government if it is democratic,' suggests Mr Julio Herrera, president of the Caribbean Basin Sugar Producers Group. 'Cuba will inevitably turn to the US as a market for its sugar. The US will be told that it has a moral obligation to buy Cuban sugar.'</p>

			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / Letter: Macedonia, the classic confusion and the needs of ethnic minorities (2) Sir, Edward Mortimer is correct to argue that Macedonia should be rescued from its present diplomatic limbo immediately. But the problem does not stop at the recognition of Macedonia as a state. The Greek government refuses to recognise the existence of Macedonians as an ethnic minority within Greece, preferring to denote them as, wait for it, slavophone Hellenes. It also denies Macedonian refugees from the Greek Civil War the right to return, even though Greek refugees from that war have long been allowed back. The UK presidency should attempt to change Greece's attitude so that the EC can credibly use its good record on individual and minority rights to encourage such practices in eastern Europe.

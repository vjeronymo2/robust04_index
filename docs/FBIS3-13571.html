Our informed sources in Baghdad say that tyrant Saddam  has retired more Army officers, who will be on their way to  disappearing from the scene forever. The source said that the  following officers have been retired:    1. Brigadier General Baha al-Din Sami;    2. Brigadier General Malik al-Juburi from the Republican  Guard;    3. Brigadier General 'Abd-al-Rahman from the second police  force [al-shurtah al-thaniyah];    4. Colonel Husam 'Abd-al-Razzaq al-'Ubaydi from the  Republican Guard;    5. Staff Colonel Nazim Saddam al-Rubay'i from the 2d Tank  Battalion.    A few days ago, the special security forces launched a  large-scale arrest campaign among Army officers because the  criminal regime suspects they had secret contacts with groups  and cells of officers working to topple the Saddamist regime.  The campaign concentrated on officers from Baghdad city and the  Mosul governorate.</p>

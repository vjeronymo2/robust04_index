			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Provisions peg Waddington to Pounds 8m A provision of Pounds 7.4m to settle a US antitrust investigation held back profits at John Waddington, the packaging, printing and games company. A further provision of Pounds 3.8m, including Pounds 2.1m of goodwill written back, on the disposal of a labels business left pre-tax profits for the year to April 2 at Pounds 8.07m on Pounds 236.1m turnover. This compares with Pounds 6.05m on turnover of Pounds 221.6m last year, when there was an exceptional charge of Pounds 9m. Profits from continuing operations before exceptionals were 5 per cent ahead from Pounds 20.4m to Pounds 21.5m, on turnover of Pounds 220.3m (Pounds 190.9m). Earnings per share were 4.33p (3.19p). A final dividend of 4.7p (4.3p) is proposed, bringing the total for the year to 8.5p (7.9p). Mr Geoff Gibson, finance director, said that the dividend was almost twice covered by earnings per share of 16.69p (13.71p) before exceptional items. Under the antitrust investigation into two of its food services companies the group has made a plea bargain, agreeing to a fine of USDollars 4.2m (Pounds 2.8m). The board expects the full provision of Pounds 7.4m to cover the fine, ensuing civil claims and legal expenses. The core packaging business raised turnover from Pounds 119.8m to Pounds 145.8m, and operating profits from Pounds 12.8m to Pounds 14.4m. Margins were just less than 10 per cent. The strongest growth in the packaging sector came from the food services division, which sells to US catering companies. Turnover rose from Pounds 28m to Pounds 45.4m, although profits of Pounds 5.4m (Pounds 3.7m) included Pounds 500,000 of exchange translation gain. The carton business improved turnover from Pounds 28.9m to Pounds 35.7m, reflecting greater volumes from blue chip customers such as Birds Eye, Cadbury, and Colgate. Mr Gibson said the group would this year invest Pounds 5m in a new production line at the Leeds factory, which would expand capacity from the start of next year. The specialist printing division reported operating profits down from Pounds 4.1m to Pounds 3.7m on turnover of Pounds 48.6m (Pounds 45.4m). Both turnover and profit in the games division were flat at Pounds 25.9m and Pounds 3.4m respectively. The group is introducing two new ranges of toys - radio controlled cars from Japan and infant and pre-school toys from the US  -which it expects will provide incremental business through its existing distribution outlets. COMMENT Take out the exceptionals and this looks a reasonable set of results, particularly if you believe the Pounds 7.4m provision for the US antitrust investigation is sufficient. The investigation appears to have done no damage to the expanding food services division. The group has also seen strong growth in the UK cartons sector, where its margins of 13.2 per cent are among the best. Pencilled in profits of about Pounds 22m would give a multiple of about 12. This is a worthwhile discount to the sector - providing there are no more exceptional charges.</p>

			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / Three weeks on, the super dinar is still working Quails' eggs, Italian ice cream and kiwi fruit have appeared again in Belgrade supermarkets since the 'super dinar' was launched three weeks ago as the beleaguered Yugoslav government's cure for hyper-inflation. But the return of these tasty luxuries to the streets of the Serbian capital is a cruel illusion. Only Belgrade's new rich, the profiteers who smuggle petrol and other goods in defiance of UN sanctions against the rump Yugoslavia, can afford them. Despite the relief induced by a few weeks without inflation, the government's chances of maintaining monetary stability, let alone implementing measures that will revive the economy, appear slim. The new dinar, fully convertible and equivalent to DM1, was introduced after several months during which it was possible to measure Yugoslav inflation by the hour and the D-Mark had come close to replacing the national currency. Although the super-currency is backed up by only Dollars 150m (Pounds 102.7m) in hard currency reserves, according to the central bank, prices of meat, milk and other staples plunged as goods hoarded by producers and wholesalers flooded back into shops. Old dinars are still circulating, but at just over 12m for one new dinar, are so inconvenient to handle they are fast disappearing. However, lower food prices have been offset by sharp increases in telephone and electricity tariffs, while new taxes are making life difficult for small businesses. Analysts warn that without curbs on public spending, including a military budget which absorbs 7.6 per cent of outlays, the government's attempts to increase revenues will have little impact on a widening deficit, forecast to reach as much as 35 per cent of gross domestic product. Prof Tomislav Popovic of the Institute of Economic Sciences believes Belgrade's tenuous monetary stability will collapse in the next two months. 'Rising costs will be passed on to consumers and the government will have to choose between facing social unrest, or printing more money and resuming the inflationary cycle,' he says. The first hint of trouble came last week when the Serb-led government announced that the country's 1.3m pensioners would receive free food packages this month but only 57 per cent of their normal pension payment. With the average monthly salary now DM50 (Pounds 19.40), while pensions average DM34 a month, most Yugoslav families must dig into their savings to survive. The cynical view is that the government is intent on absorbing most of an estimated DM1.5bn still held by private savers in Serbia and Montenegro to boost its hard currency reserves. The central bank says foreign exchange reserves have risen by DM79m in the past three weeks as foreign currency holdings have been converted into dinars under the new system. This is relatively slow progress, and the fact is that UN sanctions, together with the war in Bosnia and the breakdown of tightly integrated trade relations among the former Yugoslav republics, have brought the official economy close to collapse. Some 750,000 workers - 25 per cent of the workforce - are registered as unemployed and 1.2m more are on paid leave. Gross domestic product, now only a third of the 1990 level, is forecast to decline by at least 15 per cent this year. After a 40 per cent drop in industrial output last year, agriculture now accounts, officially, for more than 50 per cent of GDP. However, the official figures may underestimate the size of the economy. Prof Popovic estimates that the black economy, based on sanctions-breaking and tax evasion by small businessmen, is equivalent to 33 per cent of GDP.</p>

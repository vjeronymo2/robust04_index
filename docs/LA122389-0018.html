			<p><P> December 23, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A HEMISPHERE FEELS INVADED;  </P> <P> LATIN AMERICA: UNILATERAL MILITARY ACTION IS HORRIFYING TO NATIONS THAT HAVE  SEEN THE U.S. FIST BEFORE. A CHILL IS SETTLING ON THE AMERICAS' POLITICAL  CLIMATE.  </P> <P> It was not unexpected that the Organization of American States would call for  the withdrawal of American forces from Panama, declaring, as it did Friday,  that its members "deeply regretted" the U.S. military action. As could be  expected, only the United States voted against the resolution.  </P> <P> One may also expect that very limited attention will be paid by President Bush  to the O.A.S. request. After all, in the course of Thursday's press conference,  Bush expressed his gratitude for Latin America's support, just hours after  clear and open disapproval had been expressed by the leaders of such normally  friendly governments as Brazil and Mexico, and Peru had recalled its  ambassador.  </P> <P> Many in Washington seem to hold the view that unilateral U.S. action was made  almost inevitable by the inability of those same Latin American countries to  "solve the Panamanian problem" through multilateral channels. This will not  make it any easier for Latin American opinion to cut through the wave of  domestic support that follows immediately after a "decisive action" is  undertaken by the U.S. (or almost any other nation's) government.  </P> <P> In this case, the lack of historical awareness and sensitivity that Latin  Americans have come to identify with their northern neighbor seems compounded  by an apparent tendency in Washington to deal with the implications of present  U.S actions as if they were limited to an isolated issue -- one in which the  whole hemisphere has found good reason for agreement. The invasion's impact on  inter-American relations will certainly endure beyond this specific action.  </P> <P> During the last decade, U.S. ability to both dominate and lead the hemisphere  has been caught in a paradox. On the one hand, events in Central America,  particularly in El Salvador and Nicaragua, provided ample proof of the United  States' limitations, even in cases that it defined as priorities. But it is  also hard to remember another moment in which as many Latin American  governments and political forces shared U.S. preferences regarding such crucial  topics as basic economic policies or a common commitment to liberal democracy.  </P> <P> The way in which Latin American nations dealt with the "Panama problem" shows  both the potential and the limits of that increased agreement, in crucial  matters of regional security.  </P> <P> Two different principles have been at play: the aforementioned commitment to  democracy and the region's defense of non-intervention. So Gen. Manuel Noriega  had few defenders, but many Latin Americans were not happy with simply  following the the U.S. lead in identifying the one non-democratic government  that was to be subject to open pressure. There have been authoritarians  aplenty, both past and present, toward whom the United States has proven  remarkably tolerant. There was also a general unease with a perceived U.S.  tendency to "put to the democratic test" only those governments with which it  has other reasons to disagree.  </P> <P> In the case of Noriega, many observers wondered how the same corrupt  authoritarian who had once been a close friend and ally could suddenly become  so unpalatable. Some even came to the conclusion that promoting democracy in  Panama was really second in Washington's strategic calculations to the need to  have a "predictable" and "understanding" government in place before time runs  out on the Panama Canal's transfer to Panamanian authority.  </P> <P> Several Latin American governments have been, up to this very week, willing to  go along with basic U.S. preferences. But even before the invasion, public  disclosures of U.S. actions in Panama increasingly tested such willingness and  provoked muted disagreement. First came the acknowledgement of the sizable (in  relation to Panama's size) amount of dollars spent by the U.S. government in  order to influence the last electoral campaign. Then, the knowledge of covert  operations directed at destabilizing Panama's government. Now it is direct  unilateral military action. Even Venezuela's flexible interpretations of the  principle of non-intervention in relation to democracy do not go that far.  </P> <P> It is hard for U.S. observers to appreciate the hold that non-intervention has  on most Latin American minds. After all, U.S. tradition does not either oppose  or favor intervention in principle. A "just cause" (as defined by North  American perceptions) and above all, success in an endeavor, seem to make all  the difference between "good" and "bad" interventions.  </P> <P> Things look quite different from the perspective of those countries that have  suffered foreign military interventions, which most of the time have come not  from extra-hemispheric powers but from our hemisphere's leading country. Any  such U.S. action is necessarily seen as part of a well-known and recurring  pattern -- one that many in the region had hoped to see disappear as a result  of global changes.  </P> <P> By invading Panama, the U.S. government has provided common ground for diverse  governments and political forces in the region that are unwilling to condone  unilateral military action by a superpower -- even against a government that  most of them do not hold dear. Not since the Malvinas/Falklands conflict  between Britain and Argentina have the basic assumptions of the inter-American  system been put to such a test.  </P> <P> U.S. actions violate the letter and the spirit of the key documents that are  supposed to guide relations in the hemisphere. Even the usual appeals to  "collective self-defense" are absent. In contrast to the case of Grenada, we  are not even offered the fig leaf of a request by Panama's neighbors. Not even  a post-facto, pro-forma attempt to attain multilateral acquiescence has been  made -- as was the case in the Dominican Republic in 1965.  </P> <P> In the case of Panama, the entirely unilateral nature of U.S. action stands  there naked, for all to see. The ultimate paradox of this action may be to  transform Noriega -- a character that very few in Latin America are willing to  touch without a long pole -- into a credible symbol not only of Panamanian but  even of Latin nationalism.  </P></p>

			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Howard unveils tough measures Tough measures giving courts the power to lock up children as young as 10, detain persistent juvenile criminals in secure training centres and end suspects' so-called right to silence were unveiled yesterday. Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, publishing the Criminal Justice and Public Order bill and the Police and Magistrates' Courts bill, said the measures amounted to a 'comprehensive attack on every aspect of crime'. But Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, told an audience at Bramshill police college, Hampshire, that the police reforms would undermine the fight against crime. He said: 'The cumulative effect will be dramatically to increase the centralisation of policing and therefore substantially to undermine community policing.' The 117-clause Criminal Justice and Public Order bill proposes action against juvenile offenders, bail 'bandits', terrorists, trespassers and squatters. The Police and Magistrates' Courts bill sets national objectives for police, gives chief constables more flexibility over their budgets and introduces Home Office-appointed chairmen and members of slimmed-down police authorities. Mr Howard said the new members of the police authorities 'will be local people, and we are dismantling a whole series of central controls'. The measures, announced in last month's Queen's Speech, were attacked by politicians, civil liberties groups, lawyers and police. Mr Blair accused the government of increasing centralisation of power - the heads of police authorities and a third of their members are to be appointed by the government. It would allow police authorities to be amalgamated, even against local wishes. Mr Rodger Pannone, Law Society president, accused the government of ignoring recommendations of the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice which did not suit its immediate purpose - including the creation of an independent review body to consider alleged miscarriages of justice. Liberty, the civil liberties pressure group, condemned the criminal justice bill as the 'most serious and broad-ranging assault on human rights' in the UK in recent years. Police leaders warned that the police authority reforms, fixed-term contracts and performance-related pay threatened operational independence. The Association of County Councils and Association of Metropolitan Authorities called the police bill 'an expensive distraction from the real business of fighting crime'. The associations said the government had admitted that the reforms would cost Pounds 21m.</p>

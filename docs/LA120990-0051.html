			<p><P> December 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NO HEAT, LITTLE WARMTH AT GALANTER FORUM;  </P> <P> POLITICS: THE CAREFULLY ORCHESTRATED TOWN HALL MEETING ALLOWED THE COUNCILWOMAN  TO KEEP THE PEACE IN THE DISCONTENTED COMMUNITY.  </P> <P> It was a mighty silent night in Venice.  </P> <P> Though nearly 400 residents turned out for a town hall meeting with Los Angeles  City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter Wednesday night, there was no debate, minimal  dissent and none of the rip-roaring rhetoric for which the community is famous.  </P> <P> The usually voluble Venetians, some of whom have been Galanter's harshest  critics, sat quietly as the first-term councilwoman reviewed the state of the  community as she saw it.  </P> <P> The meeting was the last of a series held by Galanter in recent months around  her 6th Council District as she prepares to run for reelection next spring. She  and her staff bill the gatherings as a chance for her to hear from constituents  or help them with their problems with the city.  </P> <P> "It's for the normal people. It's for the average person who doesn't get a  chance to interact with their government very often," explained Galanter Press  Deputy Rick Ruiz.  </P> <P> The Venice event was considered to be potentially troublesome for Galanter, who  sometimes turns testy when confronted by pointed criticism. But if there is, as  some critics say, a groundswell of discontent in Venice with Galanter, there  was scant evidence at this gathering at Penmar Recreation Center. Neither,  however, was there an outpouring of support.  </P> <P> "Meetings in Venice are not generally very calm," Galanter marveled afterward.  Usually, she said, "if you have two people in Venice, you have 28 opinions."  </P> <P> But as some residents pointed out after the meeting, the only way to have a  dialogue or express dissent was to cause a scene. The carefully controlled  format allowed for no give-and-take. Only written questions were accepted and  culled by the staff. Galanter chose which ones to answer and seemed to  paraphrase rather than read them directly from the paper, they said.  </P> <P> The majority of the 18 questions she answered during a 25-minute period were  innocuous inquiries that enabled her to expound on what she has done for the  district. "I support what the community wants," was a common theme. There was  also discussion of trash cans for the beach, why city recycling has not come to  Venice (it is scheduled to start next summer or fall) and when the Venice Pier  might reopen (not yet determined).  </P> <P> Before taking questions, Galanter gave an overview of major issues in her  district. She started out with bread-and-butter issue of safety, praising  Neighborhood Watch for saving her life when she was attacked in her home during  her 1987 election campaign.  </P> <P> She talked about changing the name West Washington Boulevard to Abbot Kinney  Boulevard to honor the founder of Venice. She noted that the Venice Historical  Society is doing well.  </P> <P> Eventually, Galanter got around to the volatile development issue. She joked  that any building of more than two units was sure to cause a controversy in  Venice. No one laughed. She said she has succeeded in scaling down two of the  largest projects in her district -- the recently approved Channel Gateway in  Venice and the vast Playa Vista development, which is in the planning process.  </P> <P> Cloaked in her incumbent mantle, Galanter is surrounded at these events by  representatives of city departments, who are available for personal  consultation on matters such as law enforcement, street lighting and  maintenance.  </P> <P> While the subject of the coming City Council elections was diligently avoided,  politics was plainly in the air. As Galanter expounded on her achievements, one  of her declared opponents, Mary Lee Gray, mingled with the crowd.  </P> <P> Supporters of Gray, a field deputy for county Supervisor Deane Dana,  distributed campaign brochures outside the door.  </P> <P> A spot check of people at the meeting showed some who were trying to figure out  what was going on in Venice and some who had particular problems they wanted  resolved.  </P> <P> Alessandra De Clario, for example, said she came because she was sick of  drivers speeding down her street. She described the forum as "cute and  politically oriented," but she said she was not happy with Galanter's written  response to her complaint that said Venice was "designed for another era."  </P> <P> Engineer Ed Barnett and retiree Harleigh Webber were favorably impressed with  the evening. "I think she's doing a good job," said Barnett.  </P> <P> "I thought she did very well tonight," Webber said.  </P> <P> The only discord in an otherwise mellow night occurred when Marina Peninsula  resident Donna Chaet screamed out at Galanter during the meeting and noisily  confronted her afterward with complaints about problems on the peninsula.  Galanter received applause when she told Chaet, "If you're not happy, take a  walk and come back in five minutes."  </P></p>

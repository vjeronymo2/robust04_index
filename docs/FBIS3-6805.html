			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on statements by North Korean escapees living in </F> China about economic difficulties in North Korea--with recorded  video footage]    [Excerpt] North Korean residents who risked their lives by  escaping North Korea by crossing the border say they could no  longer bear the hunger. A Korean Chinese resident who often  visits North Korea said that the situation in North Korea is  very miserable. Correspondent Yi Tong-sik reports why North  Korean residents are leaving North Korea one after another.    [Yi Tong-sik] The situation in North Korea as told by the  North Korean escapees is really hard to believe. In Tumen in  Jilin Province, across the Tumen River from Namyang, North  Korea, women entering North Korea from the yard in front of the  customs office are loading their shabby-looking packages onto  carts. What are these?    [First unidentified speaker] They are things like bags. Do  not take pictures.    [Second unidentified speaker] Take care.    [Unidentified woman] I will let you pass it on to you after  I have seen the leader [suryongnim]. [sentence as heard]    [Yi] For those who visit North Korea to see their relatives,  the most important thing is to carry these packages, large and  small. The packages contain old clothes, vegetables, and beans,  but these are precious gifts for the North Korean residents.  Most of the escapees from North Korea give the very serious  North Korean food shortage as the reason for their escape.    [Unidentified male escapee, age 52] The North Korean  authorities do not permit edible food to be imported.  Therefore, they have to import animal feed, such as ears of  corn. They are going hungry because there is no time to process  it to make it more suitable for man to eat. They give us crude  corn with the husk in bags, telling us among whom we must divide  them.    [Unidentified male escapee, age 20] When I was working in a  coal mine while I was serving in the Army, I collapsed from  hunger while I was tunneling. My mother was arrested on 21  April 1987 because she said it is as hard to live at present as  it was in the days under Japanese domination.    [Yi] This difficult situation of North Korea is more vividly  told by the Korean residents in Yanbian, who often visit North  Korea.    [Unidentified Korean resident in Yanbian] Barley was the  last thing I wanted to eat there. They gave me meals made from  corn without the husk. They do not throw away the husks. They  make cake out of the husks. Here the husks are eaten by swine,  but in North Korea people cannot fill their stomachs.    [Yi] Do they eat rice?    [Korean resident in Yanbian] No, they cannot afford it.  They cannot even afford to eat refined corn.    [Unidentified Korean resident in China of North Korean  nationality] If I go to North Korea, they welcome me for coming  from another country. They have difficulty in providing the  guest with food. It is a pity for them. When I go there, I  feel guilty because I feel I enjoy too much comfort compared  with them.    [Yi] The seriousness of the North Korean economic difficulty  is seen not only in food shortage, but in electricity shortage  as well.    [Unidentified escapee] Although a worker's monthly wage is  170 won, he can work only three to four hours because the plant  cannot operate fully due to the shortage of raw material and  shortage of electricity. This means the wage one actually gets  is 30 to 40 won a month.    [Unidentified Korean resident in Yanbian] It is a real pity.  Many have to do without socks to wear. Most children go  barefoot because they cannot afford to wear shoes. Their feet  look like duck feet from malnutrition.    [Yi] Is there any other reason, except for the starvation  and economic difficulty, for them to risk their lives by  escaping?    [Unidentified escapee] If they could hope for a better  future, they would be patient and wait a few more years. There  is no hope in the North. Unless a fundamental change is brought  about in the North Korean system, there is no hope for any  improvement in the livelihood of the 20 million people there.    [Yi] No matter how difficult the situation in North Korea  is, crossing the border is a life-risking adventure for those  who attempt to flee. [passage omitted on material covered by  ref]</p>

			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Productivity in US increased 2.7% last year IT WILL not be long before people start talking of a US 'productivity miracle'. Figures published yesterday confirmed that output per hour in non-farm businesses is growing at its fastest rate in two decades. Productivity rose at an annual rate of 4 per cent in the fourth quarter of last year, and by 2.7 per cent in 1992 as whole. This represents a sharp turnaround after five years in which productivity growth averaged about 0.5 per cent a year. In recent congressional testimony, Mr Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve chairman, claimed the post-recession US economy was a 'different animal'. If recent productivity gains were sustained, he said, the potential US long-term growth rate might be substantially higher than the 2 to 2.5 per cent assumed by most analysts. The chairman said the reasons for faster productivity growth were not fully understood but it probably reflected 'accelerating advances in computer software and applications' that were making possible big gains in efficiency in all sectors of the economy. Capital investment in computer technology has soared in recent quarters. The most encouraging aspect of yesterday's figures was the confirmation that productivity is now rising rapidly in service-sector companies (everything from banking and insurance to retailing and tourism), which account for about three quarters of economic activity. Manufacturing productivity grew at an annual rate of 3.8 per cent in the fourth quarter, slightly slower than overall productivity, implying that service industries, if anything, are improving their efficiency even more rapidly than are manufacturers. This is a new development. In the 1980s, US manufacturing productivity rose rapidly as companies came to terms with tougher global competition. OECD figures, for example, indicate that US manufacturing productivity grew by about 55 per cent between 1980 and 1991, compared with gains of less than 40 per cent in Japan and Germany. But inefficiency in the sprawling US service sector meant that overall productivity growth was only about a third of the average pace of 1.5 per cent a year in the industrialised world as a whole. Better productivity figures augur well for inflation because the growth of labour costs per unit of output is falling rapidly. Unit labour costs rose at an annual rate of 0.6 per cent in the fourth quarter and by 0.7 per cent relative to the equivalent period in 1991, the smallest annual rise since the mid-1960s. If sustained, such low increases in unit labour costs could result in a fall in inflation below the consensus forecast of 2.5 to 3 per cent this year. The surge in productivity growth explains a hitherto puzzling feature of the current recovery: the juxtaposition of very bullish news on economic growth (such as the 5.3 per gain in factory orders between November and December reported yesterday) with depressing reports of big job cuts at leading blue-chip companies such as IBM and Sears Roebuck. For the first time since 1945, the US is experiencing a 'jobless recovery'. Nearly all the growth of gross domestic product has reflected gains in productivity, rather than increases in employment, which has barely moved since the official end of the recession nearly two years ago. Analysts are keenly awaiting the US employment figures for January, due today, in the hope they will show the beginnings of a revival in job-creation. But the chances are the US will have to learn to love productivity-led growth.</p>

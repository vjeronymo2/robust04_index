			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Crystal to leave Tottenham board MR JONATHAN CRYSTAL yesterday tendered his resignation from the board of Tottenham Hotspur's football club. His resignation, which becomes effective on November 4, was accepted by the Tottenham board chaired by Mr Alan Sugar. Mr Crystal is the only remaining director who supports Mr Terry Venables, Tottenham Hotspur's former chief executive who was sacked by Mr Sugar following their bitter court battle over control of the London club. Earlier this week it emerged that Mr Sugar, who owns 47 per cent of the company, was considering calling an extraordinary meeting in an attempt to force Mr Crystal off the board. No date had been set but it could have taken place at the end of this month. A move against Mr Crystal had been expected. The barrister had been a solid Venables supporter and Mr Sugar had publicly blamed Mr Venables' relationship with Mr Crystal for the turmoil at the club and had invited him to resign. Mr Sugar also wants to force Mr Venables out of the company, but has undertaken not to oust the former chief executive from the board until High Court hearings over their dispute are completed. Mr Crystal's resignation will probably be seen as a victory for Mr Sugar. However, by tendering his resignation but delaying the date it becomes effective, Mr Crystal may have secured a few more months on the board.</p>

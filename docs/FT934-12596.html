			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: At what cost new funds? Sir, Richard Lapper's piece ('Back from the abyss', October 22) on the arrival of corporate investors at Lloyd's gave some useful background for potential new investors to bear in mind. The extent to which the new corporate vehicles will be exposed to past losses seems unclear, which must be a concern. The other fairly big reservation I would have is just how much is going to be extracted in expenses before the investor receives his return. To the famed rapacity of those at Lloyd's, something now has to be added for all those nice merchant banks and brokers, not known for undercharging, who have suddenly become so enthusiastic about the new Lloyd's product. No doubt all this will be clearly set out in the prospectuses. Peter Milne, 13 Spenser Road, Harpenden, Hertfordshire AL5 5NW</p>

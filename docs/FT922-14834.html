			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Kenyan protest crumbles CALM was restored to Nairobi and other provincial Kenyan cities yesterday as support for a two-day general strike crumbled. The Kenyan government said three people had been shot and wounded and 83 people arrested during violent clashes between rioters and police on Thursday at the start of the 48-hour national stoppage called by the opposition Forum for the Restoration of Democracy (Ford) to force the government to release what they claim are political prisoners. Many private taxis stayed off the streets, disrupting transport services, but most of Nairobi's work force reached their jobs and most shops reopened. A government statement yesterday said the strike had 'comprehensively failed'. It said other opposition parties had not supported Ford.</p>

			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Fiat By launching its rights issue now, Fiat is asking shareholders for more than the usual act of faith. The company always looked likely to raise fresh equity at some point to fund its prodigious capital investment programme. But as yet Fiat can offer scant evidence that new models - such as the recently launched Punto - will be a success. The first signs of recovery in the European car market are probably the best part of a year away. On that basis, it is extremely difficult to judge whether Fiat will earn a decent return on capital now being sunk into the business. The worry is that there is little in the capital-raising package to suggest that Fiat has changed its spots. The involvement of outside investors such as Deutsche Bank and Alcatel Alsthom might be taken as comforting. That said, Deutsche picked up its existing shares near the top of the market in 1986, which says little for its judgment of underlying value. On the surface, the planned sale of Fiat's 58 per cent stake in Rinascente, Italy's biggest retailer, marks a welcome step back from the empire-building of the past. Yet the convoluted plan to sell the stake to Ifil, one of Fiat's main shareholders, is no substitute for a clean break. The suspicion remains that such changes have been forced on Fiat by circumstance. It would be more encouraging to see an infusion of new blood among top management instead of the old guard postponing retirement. Fiat's predicament stems from the poor performance of its automotive business during the late 1980s, during a period of unwise diversification. Raising equity is a remedy for the current financial headache, but it will not prevent a re-run.</p>

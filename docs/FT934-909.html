			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Gifts to get your teeth into: The world's best-selling Christmas presents Soap or socks are not the only Christmas presents for those who have everything. There are still a few surprises. One gentleman from the United Arab Emirates has bought a life-like, automated baby tyrannosaurus rex from the catalogue of Neiman Marcus, the Texan Christmas mail order book for the truly rich and famous. At Dollars 63,000 (Pounds 42,300) the model has darting eyes and moving head, legs and tail, and the mouth opens and closes. For those with a big enough home, Neiman Marcus still has the baby dinosaur's partner for sale - a Dollars 93,000 model of a full-grown triceratops, nearly 7ft high and more than 12ft long. Elsewhere in the US, the promise of a robust economic recovery is filtering through into the high street. At New York department store Bloomingdale's some of the most popular presents this year are cashmere sweaters, gloves and scarves. The 'hemline index', which dictates that when times are good, skirts get shorter, appears to be holding true. Bloomingdale's reports the surprise of the season is the continuing demand for the '16-inch micro-mini skirt'. In Europe, too, sales of Christmas gifts are higher than in previous years. At Harrods, still one of London's grandest stores, managers are keeping their fingers crossed for the shop's best ever Christmas. They have sold out of their seasonal food hampers, which cost up to Pounds 1,000 a time, and staff have been put to work filling more. Fashion jewellery has proved particularly popular, with 10,000 pairs of earrings - a quarter of the department's annual sales - sold in the run-up to Christmas. At Giorgio Armani in Milan, sales are booming of traditional Christmas gifts such as accessories and perfume. Perfume, not surprisingly, also tops the list in Paris at the high-class Printemps store. Meanwhile, in Germany many consumers will find a telephone among the piles of seasonal favourites this year. The big demand follows the recent liberalisation of the local telephone system, according to Kaufhof, the Cologne-based stores group. In Europe, customers appear to be turning their backs on opulence only at the gift department of Paris's Galeries Lafayette. Staff report a rush for imported ethnic garments and household goods. Customers are also keen, they say, on ecologically sound items such as recycled writing paper. In Australia, traditional presents such as writing paper are also selling well. But it is French perfume that has surprised Australian re-tailers with an 'extraordinary comeback', says Don Grover, general manager of one of the David Jones stores in Sydney. He believes this is because of the launch of several new perfumes in Australia over the past year. The number one slot, however, is still held by Chanel. With Christmas taking place at 300C, many Australian women can look forward to getting a pair of lady's boxer shorts. For Australian men ties are big news, with one designed to celebrate the staging of the Olympic Games in the year 2000 selling well. (Presumably its popularity will run and run.) Elsewhere, the less favourable economic mood has reduced the chance of receiving an expensive or exotic Christmas present. In Japan the current economic downturn is taking its toll. During the 'bubble' period of the late 1980s, the winter gift-giving season was a chance for both ordinary Japanese people and corporations to overwhelm relatives and clients with tasty foods: expensive liquors, live crabs and lobsters, and carefully wrapped fruit. This year many people are not sending the customary gifts, and those that are tend to choose basic products such as soy sauce and soy bean paste. Takashimaya, the upmarket retailer, says it is the first time in 10 years that customers have chosen such products. One of the few pieces of good news is for the pearl industry, thanks to this year's Imperial wedding of Crown Prince Naruhito and Princess Masako, the former career diplomat. She is often seen wearing pearl earrings and bracelets, and as a result many men are buying pearls to send their girlfriends and wives. For the kids, taste and incomes vary. Computers and computer games head many lists. A survey by market researchers Mori shows that one in three British families will buy a computer-related present this Christmas, a finding borne out by London toy shop Hamley's, where Sega games machines top the list of purchases. But whereas this year's Mortal Kombat game has hit the headlines with its seemingly gratuitous violence, and its password to bar younger children from the higher levels of gore, gentler games have proved popular in Europe. Fifa International Soccer and Jurassic Park are the big sellers this Christmas in the UK, for example. For Australian children rollerblades and golf clubs are among the most requested presents in the 'Dear Santa' letters analysed by Australia Post, while many youngsters requested their own mobile phone. Dinosaurs (the remote-control version) are also much in demand. In the US it is not the mobile phone but the pager that is the latest high-tech addition for the with-it kid on the street. Discredited for many years because of their association with drugs dealers, pink, blue or yellow pagers are now proving so popular that some schools are having to ban them to prevent them bleeping during lessons. And for those that cannot afford a Neiman Marcus mechanised dinosaur, there are alternatives. The merchandising opportunity of the year has been Barney, an insipidly sweet, purple, stuffed toy dinosaur. Youngsters, it would seem, just cannot get enough of him.</p>

			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / International Capital Markets: Latin American corporate bond fund to be launched TAKING advantage of the increasing flow of Eurobond issues from Latin America, a new dollar-denominated corporate bond fund is being launched with an initial size of Dollars 50m to Dollars 100m. The Latin American Corporate Bond Fund will invest in companies which are 'market leaders with first-rate balance sheets, but the wrong address', according to Mr Audley Twiston Davies of Latin American Securities, advisers to the fund. It will be set up as a closed-end trust with a 10-year term. Most of the borrowers will be from Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela and Chile, of which only the last has investment grade status from Standard &amp; Poor's or Moody's, the two main credit rating agencies. The country rating provides a ceiling on corporate ratings. The International Finance Corporation, the private sector affiliate of the World Bank, has said it will invest up to Dollars 15m in the new fund. Mr Twiston Davies said the yield spread on the new fund was expected to be more than 400 basis points over five-year US Treasuries, giving a yield of about 9.5 per cent. There was also scope for capital gains as Latin American countries and companies were re-rated. Among Latin American corporate bonds, some Mexican issues have yield spreads of less than 400 basis points, while the better Brazilian ones range from 450 to 500 basis points, according to one expert on the region. Last year, Latin American borrowers tapped the Eurobond market with about 90 issues, raising nearly Dollars 10bn. Well over 100 issues are expected to be made this year, raising up to 50 per cent more.</p>

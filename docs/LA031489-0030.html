			<p><P> March 14, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> TEACHER STABBED BY STUDENT FEARS RETURN TO CLASSROOM  </P> <P> Olive Vista Junior High School teacher Cynthia Edwards said Monday that she  shudders when thinking about returning to the classroom where she was stabbed a  week ago by one of her students.  </P> <P> "I want to cry a lot," said Edwards, 37, in a telephone interview. "I keep  asking myself, 'Why? What did I do except try to teach?' "  </P> <P> Edwards, who is recovering at home after being released from the hospital  Friday, said she was reviewing Homer's "The Odyssey" shortly after lunch on  March 6 when she was attacked by a 15-year-old boy who had been a disciplinary  problem since transfering into her fifth-period English class in February.  </P> <P> The boy, whose name is being withheld because of his age, has been charged with  assault with a deadly weapon. At a hearing Thursday, a juvenile court judge  said that the boy had shown several students a knife and told them he was going  to attack Edwards. He is being held at Sylmar Juvenile Hall.  </P> <P> "He was having a disagreement with another young fellow, using a lot of  profanity," said Edwards, who taught in two East Los Angeles junior high  schools for 10 years before tranferring to the Sylmar school in September.  </P> <P> The day before, the boy had been assigned to write "I will be quiet in Period 5  classes" 125 times as punishment for repeatedly speaking out of turn, Edwards  said.  </P> <P> "The class was working but he kept interrupting," Edwards said. "One student  doesn't have the right to interrupt the whole class, so I attempted to get rid  of him as quickly as possible, but evidently I didn't work quickly enough."  </P> <P> Edwards said she began writing an office referral on the boy that included a  request to speak with his parents when she noticed him approaching her desk.  </P> <P> "I felt a pain in my shoulder and I assumed that he hit me," Edwards said. "He  looked around at the classroom and then ran out . . . . One of my students came  up and said, 'You have a knife in your back.' "  </P> <P> Edwards said she has made no plans about returning to work. She said the attack  shows how teachers in the Los Angeles Unified School District need protection  such as emergency telephones in classrooms.  </P> <P> "If I had a phone, I could have called security to get the student out of the  classroom without having to take the five or six minutes to write the referral  and let him hurt me," she said.  </P> <P> A little more than half of the district's 600 or so schools, including Olive  Vista, have some type of intercom system that link classrooms to the main  office, district officials said. But no more than 25 schools have emergency  telephones that can be programmed to signal an emergency immediately to school  officials, said Rod Macdonell, the district's electrical supervisor.  </P> <P> Edwards, who had an emergency telephone in her classroom last year while  teaching at Stevenson Junior High School in East Los Angeles, said the Olive  Vista intercom system is too cumbersome to use in emergencies. Teachers there  must push a button and wait for an office secretary to notice a flashing light  and then go to another room to answer the call using a special telephone,  school officials said.  </P> <P> District spokeswoman Diana Munatones said the district had considered a plan to  put telephones in every classroom but dropped the idea because of the high  cost. "If we had the funds, we would do it," she said.  </P></p>

			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: White paper proposals broaden access to information THE main proposals included in the government's white paper on open government, which was published yesterday are: A code of practice on access to information. This would be introduced from April 1994 and apply to central government departments and agencies, with similar codes for the National Health Service and local authorities. There will be consultation with the organisations before the codes are finalised, but the aim is that they provide clear statements of information the government will volunteer and what it will provide on request. The central government code will include a commitment to meet reasonable requests for information relating to departmental policies and decisions. Exemptions will cover information where, for example, disclosure would harm defence or security; would harm the decision-taking process within government; might prejudice legal proceedings; or would harm the government's ability to manage the economy. A new role for the ombudsman. The ombudsman will police the way departments operate the code. If someone believes that information has been wrongly withheld, and an MP passes the complaint on to the ombudsman's department, he can investigate whether the government has acted according to the code. The cross-party committee of MPs which covers the ombudsman's work can call ministers and officials to account if the ombudsman believes they have not behaved properly. A statutory right of access to personal information. This would apply to records held by government departments, local authorities, the NHS, the police and schools and colleges. Categories of information and exemptions for these public sector bodies would be similar to the Data Protection Act, which introduced a right of access to public and private-sector records held on computer. A statutory right of access to health and safety information held by public authorities. This would cover matters such as the safety of public places and consumer goods. Protection would be provided for genuine trade secrets and manufacturing knowhow, and past information given in confidence would not be revealed. The aim would be to make the regulation process more understandable and transparent to the public and affected industries. In the case both of this right and the right to personal information, there would be a right of appeal to an external authority, such as an independent tribunal. Both rights would not be retrospective and would apply only to information provided once they had passed into law. A two-tier charging system, with a flat-rate fee for straightforward information and a higher charge for information requiring additional work, could be introduced for information disclosed under the code of practice or the new statutory rights. Selective introduction of 'harm tests'. Where statutory limits on the government's ability to release information are retained, there is the prospect of introducing 'harm tests'. These would ensure that no one would be penalised for disclosing information unless its release did some damage. Review and release of public records. In future, records will not be closed for longer than 30 years unless actual damage would be done by their release. Special treatment for royal papers will end. Guiding principles will be that records remain closed for longer than 30 years only where release would harm national security, defence or the UK's economic interests; would be a breach of good faith; or would cause substantial distress or danger.</p>

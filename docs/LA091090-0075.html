			<p><P> September 10, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WASHINGTON INSIGHT  </P> <P> CONGRESSIONAL KUDOS: President Bush's decision to provide increased Western  economic help to the Soviet Union is likely to win broad support when he  addresses a joint session of Congress on Tuesday night, congressional  strategists say.  </P> <P> Beleaguered by negative reaction at home to the savings and loan crisis and  other national ills, the lawmakers have been "looking for something positive"  that they can support, key Capitol Hill watchers say. Many in Congress already  appear to be prepared to reward Moscow for backing the United Nations sanctions  against Iraq. "The Soviets deserve some thanks," the hawkish Sen. Sam Nunn  (D-Ga.) said.  </P> <P> Bush is considering an international effort to provide massive economic aid to  Moscow -- complementing a modest boost in U.S. assistance with contributions  from other Western nations. Bureaucrats also are preparing legislation that  would grant most-favored-nation trade status to Moscow -- a goal the Soviets  have been pursuing for months.  </P> <P> WHERE THE BOYS ARE: President Bush plans to visit American troops in Saudi  Arabia, both as a morale-builder and to bolster political support at home. But  the White House inadvertently confirmed that as it stands now, the President  isn't expecting the troops to come home soon. Among the dates being considered  for his visit: Thanksgiving -- or even Christmas.  </P> <P> Part of the reason for the holdup: an already hectic schedule. The President  already has an autumn full of political campaign trips on the calendar, and he  is hoping to revive a plan to spend a week in Latin America, a trip that was  scuttled because of the Iraq crisis.  </P> <P> WAR WOES: Top U.S. economic policy-makers are becoming increasingly worried  about the growing weakness of the U.S. economy. Although Bush Administration  officials are maintaining an optimistic face in public, some strategists are  fearful that this weakening will squeeze the budget deficit and make it more  difficult to finance operations in the Mideast.  </P> <P> Particularly troublesome is the continued slide in the value of the dollar,  which has plunged some 7% since the gulf crisis began -- mainly as a reflection  of financial markets' fears that the White House is trying to pressure the  Federal Reserve Board to abandon its stand against inflation.  </P> <P> On White House orders, top Administration officials have eased their criticism  of the Fed in recent days, but analysts say that much still depends on how well  White House and congressional negotiators do at hammering out an accord on  narrowing the federal budget deficit.  </P> <P> THE BRADY CRUNCH?: Capital gossips couldn't help notice a big disparity last  week, when Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Treasury Secretary  Nicholas F. Brady went on separate round-the-world trips to ask America's  allies to contribute financially to the campaign against Iraq. Baker brought  back promises of billions of dollars from Saudi Arabia and the exiled emir of  Kuwait, while Brady had to settle for lukewarm responses from Britain, France,  South Korea and Japan. Administration watchers say the disparity wasn't  accidental, however: Baker, who is senior to Brady, grabbed trips to those  capitals from which the United States had advance assurances that the  governments were willing to contribute big.  </P></p>

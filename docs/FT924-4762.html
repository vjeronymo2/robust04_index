			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Heseltine could face court battle COALFIELD communities threatened by pit closures are likely to widen their campaign against the government by taking legal action against Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary. The first steps towards court were taken yesterday when Mr Anthony Scrivener QC argued that both Mr Heseltine and Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, had been in breach of their statutory duty under the 1989 Electricity Act. Mr Scrivener has conducted an inquiry into pit closures for Nottinghamshire County Council. Public and private-sector organisations in Nottinghamshire, fearful of seven pit closures with direct and indirect job losses of 14,000, have been vocal in their protests. Mr Scrivener also suggested that action could be taken in the European Court against Mr Heseltine under Articles 90 and 92 of the Treaty of Rome, which established the European Community. These relate to distortion of competition by publicly owned enterprises. Mr Scrivener contended both that 'there is unequivocal evidence of a rigged market' in electricity and that, under the terms of the Electricity Act, the secretary of state, in this case Mr Heseltine, has a duty to promote competition. 'If the evidence is such that competition is being distorted, as claimed, then not only has he the power to act but he has a duty to do so and in the final resort interested parties have a right, enforceable in the courts, to require him to perform his duty,' he said. Mr Martin Gawith, deputy leader of the council, said: 'We will hope to get our partners together to seek legal redress.' He was referring to the councils in the Coalfield Communities Campaign. Mr Scrivener also considered that the legality of a levy on fossil fuels and a subsidy to nuclear power 'must be questionable' under the Treaty of Rome. He said that 'proceedings could be taken . . . without getting involved in the more controversial question of governments in the EC providing subsidies  -which is a political 'hot potato'.' The Scrivener report was yesterday submitted to Mr Heseltine who is preparing a white paper on energy policy, and to the Commons trade and industry committee. Politics, Page 8</p>

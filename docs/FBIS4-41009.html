			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lev Rumyantsev] </F>   [Text] St. Petersburg June 21 TASS -- Russian governors  will "insist on a soonest meeting with President Boris Yeltsin"  to tell him about their opinion of ways out of the economic  crisis, Leningrad Regional Governor Aleksandr Belyakov told  ITAR-TASS today upon the completion of a governors' meeting in  Novgorod.    "The president meets anyone but us, and we know the Russian  life from inside," said Belyakov. In his words, the governors  have elaborated 23 measures which, they believe, will help to  overcome the economic crisis and they want to tell the president  about that immediately.    The governors give a priority to the 10,000,000,000,000  ruble  emission to make the ruble/dollar correlation real and settle  the non-payment problem a reason for which is the enterprises'  lack of proceeds they have earned.    Anti-crisis proposals also include the introduction of a  modern bill mechanism, state insurance of loans to the  population, state control over the increased cost of energy  carriers and cargo transportation, subordination of all federal  structures in regions to the municipal authorities and the  introduction of the governor status in Russia.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by military observer Viktor Badurkin: "We Write </F> Dollar. Russia Loses Billions, Surrendering Arms Market to  Competitors"]    [Excerpts] I remember five years ago when I first wanted  to write an article about the arms trade I was advised not to  touch on this "slippery" subject. They said that it was  shameful to make money from other people's blood and that I  should on the contrary advocate universal disarmament. And we  have acted, and in such a way that the whole world has gasped.  First we axed the army then the defense industry and we have  "surrendered" the world arms market with virtually no  resistance. We were applauded and warmly supported (verbally)  but for some reason there were none who were eager to follow the  example.    Today we have come to our senses. We have realized that it  is shameful to squander irreplaceable natural resources,  shameful when a great industrial power is assigned the role of a  raw material tributary, shameful to ask for help and credits.  And we have looked hopefully to our censured and destroyed  defense industry: Save us, dear defense industry, earn currency  for the country.    But what can it do if the majority of the sector's plants  are  still on compulsory Christmas vacation because of the shortage  of funds and resources, if the state has still paid less than  half of what it owes for output bought last year and the  financing of science has been reduced almost tenfold?...  [passage omitted]    Gennadiy Yampolskiy, deputy chairman of the State Committee  for the Defense Industry, admits that so far warehouse stocks of  arms and equipment have been sold off -- mainly items with which  our army is "stuffed full." The producers of new output have  mostly remained without orders. Because "fresh" models cannot  be exported. And if someone does try to overcome these bans and  restrictions he soon realizes it is a hopeless business.    At the "Fakel" plant near Moscow they designed a very  "intelligent" air defense missile. And they did so at their own  initiative and using their own funds. There is no shortage of  people anxious to buy it, including the Russian Defense  Ministry. But the trouble is that no one in this country has  money and it cannot be sold abroad without special permission.  And the "commodity" is left with no demand for it. [passage  omitted]    It would be all right if it were only foreign businessmen  who  were preventing us from trading. One can understand them. But  how can one understand our own Russian Government, which is  "putting spokes in the wheels?" To draw up an ordinary contract  you need to spend 12-18 months touring the corridors and bowing  and scraping in offices. Over the course of three years there  have been 12 (!) decisions by the president and government on  deliveries of aircraft to China and the sale of licenses. And  far from all the decisions were irreproachable. For instance  one Russian firm agreed with the Chinese that the latter would  pay for their deal half in currency and half in barter but the  joint government commission gave our southern neighbors the  go-ahead to reduce the currency proportion to 35 percent. Here  barter is subject to such taxes that it is becoming  disadvantageous to import it to Russia. Or take another  example. Our aircraft industry officials reached an agreement  with the United Arab emirates for the delivery of output worth  several hundreds of millions of dollars but after Vice Premier  Shokhin's trip there it emerges that three quarters of the  profits will go to pay state debts. Enterprises naturally do  not like this "aid" from the state -- they have to pay their  workers' wages, settle accounts for deliveries and taxes. No  one now wants to work at a loss.    It is an open secret that one of the main aims of any  international meetings at all levels is to "push" one's own  goods on the foreign market, including the market in arms and  military equipment. Our defense industry officials expect as  much from their own government. And not directives with a  mounting list of countries with whom it is "not recommended"  that contracts be maintained for various short-term political  reasons. There should be a reduction in the export duty, not an  increase in taxes. You can only shear a sheep which has managed  to grow a fleece, you can take nothing from a naked sheep except  its skin and its meat. [passage omitted]    Our newspaper recently wrote about the fiber-optic equipment  developed at Chelyabinsk-70, which surpasses in quality any  foreign counterparts and is far cheaper. And then what? The  Americans intend rapidly to lift the ban on the sale of their  fiber-optic technology to Russia which, according to their  calculations, could bring in about $100 million in annual  profit. But the Russian Federation Communications Ministry is  signing documents on the construction in Voronezh of a plant for  the production of cable using the technology of British and  German firms. Again the result is that no one is a prophet in  his own country. We subsidize foreigners and bar the way to our  own people.    It is naive and futile to hope that the defense industry  will  become a "golden fish" by itself and bring the state sufficient  currency without support. The hen which lays the golden eggs is  also in need of care and feeding.</p>

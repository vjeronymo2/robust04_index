			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / International Company News: Provision news hits Pechiney share price Shares in Pechiney International, the French packaging company, fell sharply yesterday following Wednesday's announcement that it would take a provision of up to Dollars 75m to cover the purchase of excessive amounts of metals at unfavourable prices. The shares closed down FFr10.4 at FFr198. The company, a subsidiary of Pechiney, the state-owned aluminium producer slated for privatisation, said it would still record significant profits this year. It planned to maintain its 1993 dividend at the FFr5 per share paid last year. The provision was taken largely to cover long-term purchases of aluminium, mainly by American National Can (ANC), the company's US subsidiary. Pechiney said ANC had agreed forward purchases of the metal for 1993, 1994 and 1995 on the basis of prices of about Dollars 1,400 a tonne. Prices have fallen to below Dollars 1,200 since the contracts were agreed in the first half of the year. Pechiney said the price conditions were 'likely to result in an exceptional expense'. It said the expense could reach a net charge of Dollars 75m, although this could be reduced through financial management measures to be taken soon. Ironically, Pechiney's group results have suffered from the fall in the aluminium prices, a result of cheap imports from eastern Europe and the republics of the former Soviet Union. However, Pechiney's aluminium plants are principally in Europe, and ANC buys the metals it uses for packaging on the US market.</p>

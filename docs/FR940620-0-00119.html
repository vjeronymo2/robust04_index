ADAAG 4.1.6 states that where compliance is ``technically infeasible, the alteration shall provide accessibility to the maximum extent feasible.'' ``Technically infeasible,'' as defined in ADAAG 4.1.6, recognizes ``existing structural conditions [that] require removing or altering a load-bearing member which is an essential part of the structural frame'' and ``other existing physical or site constraints [that] prohibit modification or addition of elements, spaces, or features'' in compliance with ADAAG. Technical infeasibility, which is specific to alterations, is intended to cover various situations that often must be considered on a case-by-case basis. The specific concerns shared by commenters, including those with respect to grab bars, may constitute ``technical infeasibility'' in many cases.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 12.5&blank;Requirements for Accessible Cells or Rooms  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section contains the minimum requirements for accessible cells or rooms. These requirements, which are similar to those for holding cells in judicial facilities in ADAAG 11.4.2, are based in part on specifications in ADAAG 9 for rooms in transient lodging. The NPRM asked whether any of these requirements, as proposed, conflicted with existing security requirements inherent in cell design. Relatively few commenters responded to this question. Most comments addressed requirements for doors in ADAAG 12.5.2(1) or responded to specific issues raised in the NPRM concerning toilet and bathing facilities addressed in ADAAG 12.5.2(2) which are discussed below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In the NPRM, the requirements of ADAAG 12.5 were intended to apply to those elements or spaces that may be provided within cells or in adjacent common use areas such as dayrooms. These requirements have been clarified to apply only to those elements or spaces provided within housing or holding cells or rooms. Elements and spaces provided in common use areas, such as dayrooms, are subject to ADAAG requirements for common use areas according to ADAAG 12.1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 12.5.2(1)&blank;Door and Doorways <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This provision requires that all doors and doorways on an accessible route comply with ADAAG 4.13 (Doors). As proposed, this requirement contained an exemption from the requirements for maneuvering clearances (4.13.6), door hardware (4.13.9), opening force (4.13.11), and automatic or power-assisted operation (4.13.12) where detainees or inmates are escorted by security personnel at all times. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As discussed in ADAAG 11.4.2, corrections officials and several design professionals indicated that design requirements may necessitate use of 300 to 500 pound doors. Such doors cannot meet the specification for closing and opening forces in ADAAG 4.13.10 (Door Closers) and 4.13.11 (Door Opening Force) without, at a minimum, power-assist devices. In addition, commenters noted that security requirements may prohibit the use of certain door hardware often used in meeting the specifications for door hardware in ADAAG 4.13.9 (Door Hardware). Accessible door hardware, such as lever handles, may be more easily removed than doorknobs and other types of door hardware. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Consistent with provisions for entrances in ADAAG 12.2, the exception has been revised to include doors and doorways subject to security requirements that prohibit full compliance with ADAAG 4.13.6 (Maneuvering Clearances at Doors), 4.13.9 (Door Hardware), 4.13.11 (Door Closers), and 4.13.12 (Automatic Doors and Power-Assisted Doors). In addition, a reference to the specifications for door closers (ADAAG 4.13.10) has been added. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 12.5.2(2)&blank;Restrooms <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This provision requires that toilet facilities comply with ADAAG 4.22 (Toilet Rooms) and that bathing facilities comply with ADAAG 4.23 (Bathrooms, Bathing Facilities, and Shower Rooms). This provision further notes that privacy screens, where provided, not encroach upon the clear floor space required at fixtures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter recommended that this provision reference ADAAG 4.16 (Toilets) and 4.19 (Lavatories) instead of ADAAG 4.22 (Toilet Rooms) since such fixtures are often located within housing or holding cells and not separate toilet rooms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  References to ADAAG 4.22 and 4.23 do not preclude the installation of either toilet or bathing fixtures within cells as long as the specifications, including those for clear floor space, are met. These references clarify that the maneuvering space and other requirements found in ADAAG 4.22 and 4.23 apply even if the room functions primarily as a housing or holding cell. Since requirements for the cell itself, including necessary maneuvering space, may be used to meet the maneuvering space required by ADAAG 4.22 or 4.23, these references do not have substantially greater impact than do references to the specifications for specific fixtures. This is clarified in an appendix note to this provision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed under ADAAG 11.4.2, many holding and housing cells are equipped with a combination toilet and lavatory unit. These combination units maximize space and are easier to install than separate fixtures. The NPRM asked whether these type of units are actually required in cells and whether combination units that fully meet ADAAG requirements are available. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several corrections officials indicated that they were unaware of any combination unit that fully complies with ADAAG. Corrections officials of some States, such as California, Florida, and Michigan, noted that separate fixtures are used in accessible cells. Manufacturers confirmed that the standard design of combination units, including those otherwise considered accessible by the industry, do not fully meet ADAAG requirements. Specifically, the standard design of these units cannot easily incorporate the 36 inch long rear grab bar required by ADAAG. Several commenters, including a design firm, thought that it may be possible to install a grab bar of shorter length, perhaps up to 24 to 26 inches, on some units. According to one correction official, however, mounting a 26 inch grab bar on the unit would double the amount of space required and quadruple the cost.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several corrections agencies indicated that combination units are not required but are used frequently, primarily because they require less space than separate fixtures. One design professional noted that their use is preferred in police station holding cells for security reasons. The only source identified as actually requiring combination units was Virginia's ``Guide of Minimum Standards in Design and Construction of Jail Facilities'' which requires such units in maximum security cells. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Based on the comments, it is apparent that the use of combination units are generally not required, but they are often preferred for more efficient use of space and greater security. The requirement for toilet rooms complying with ADAAG 4.22 remains unchanged.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / Economics: Indicators prompt market focuson inflation in UK and Germany THE FLOW of UK official statistics continues this week with the latest figures for retail sales, retail price inflation and the public sector borrowing requirement. Economists are expecting a fall in July retail sales as a correction to the inflated June figure, which was pushed up by early summer sales. Price discounts in the high streets were also one of the factors pushing the June inflation rate down to 1.2 per cent. City economists are forecasting that it notched back up to 1.5 per cent in July, partly as a bounce back from June, but also because of certain other factors such as the ending of British Telecommunications' special offer on cheap rate local calls. None the less, prices for seasonal food usually fall sharply in July and continuing summer sales will help keep prices low for clothing, footwear and household goods. Most economists are confident that underlying inflation - the RPI excluding mortgage interest payments - will remain within the government's target range of between 1 per cent and 4 per cent for the rest of this year, although they expect it to have crept upwards in July. This week also sees the release of west Germany's July producer prices which are expected to have stayed broadly flat, with inflationary pressures at the producer level very weak. However, M3 - also due this week - will show that the story at a consumer level is quite the opposite with prices still stubbornly high. June's annualised growth was 7 per cent.

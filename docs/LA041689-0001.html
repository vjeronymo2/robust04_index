			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Thanks to NBC, I can now get some work done because I won't have to sit in  front of the TV watching my favorite game show. NBC took off the wonderful  "Sale of the Century." When they cancel "Classic Concentration," I will sell my  TV and go work for McDonald's.  </P> <P> Virginia Charman, North Hollywood  </P></p>

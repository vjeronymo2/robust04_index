He  said the new era can be brought about considering that the  appointment of Tan Sri Sakaran Dandai as the new Sabah chief  minister be well accepted by all sides in the state. [sentence  as heard] He told reporters this when asked about the setting up  of the new Sabah cabinet.    He had earlier launched the book: THE MAKING OF THE NATIONAL  CAR -- NOT JUST A DREAM. Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir said the number  of members in the Sabah cabinet had yet to be determined and  that the matter would be discussed at the meeting of the  National Front Supreme Council to be held in Kuala Lumpur  tomorrow night.</p>

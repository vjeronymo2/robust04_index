			<p><P> May 25, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MAN WHO KILLED 2 STUDIO GUARDS IS RULED INSANE  </P> <P> A former mental patient today was found innocent by reason of insanity in the  fatal shootings of two Universal Studios guards, in a plea bargain that  prosecutors say will keep him hospitalized for the rest of his life.  </P> <P> Nathan Nicholas Trupp, 43, said he understood the terms of his plea and  acknowledged that he killed guards Jeren Beeks and Armando Torres in a violent  attack at a Universal Studios gate on Dec. 1, 1988.  </P> <P> Trupp, who was sought by New Mexico authorities for investigation of killing  three people in Albuquerque a few days earlier, went to the studio in search of  actor Michael Landon.  </P> <P> As the slender, bearded Trupp entered his pleas, the families of the two  victims sat sobbing in the spectator section of the court. Two of them said  outside they were pleased that Trupp was now unable to harm anyone else.  </P></p>

			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Honeymoon accounting offers financial advantages - The controversy surrounding past TI acquisitions THE LAUNCH last week of TI Group's hostile bid for Dowty, the aerospace company, raised familiar questions about how Mr Christopher Lewinton, the TI chairman, accounts for acquisitions in his rapidly growing engineering group. Although within accounting standards, TI's past treatment of acquisitions is almost certain to figure prominently in Dowty's defence this month. The ensuing debate will again highlight current accounting rules which grant acquiring companies a financial honeymoon during which to reorganise their prize, a luxury not available to the same degree to incumbent managements. Ironically Mr Michael Garner, TI's finance director, is a member of the Accounting Standards Board which later this year will produce a draft standard covering the treatment of fair value adjustments on acquisitions. This well-established practice allows the cost of reorganising an acquisition to be defrayed without impacting on profits. It has been widely criticised as a way in which ordinary operating costs can be 'lost', boosting reported profits and earnings. The acquisition accounting issue looms particularly large for TI. Its rapid transformation since 1986 from Tube Investments has involved a heavy acquisition programme and an equally heavy use of fair value adjustments. Over the period it spent about Pounds 500m on acquisitions and another Pounds 100m on reorganisation. Almost all acquisitive companies make use of the practice. At its simplest it allows an acquiring company to identify costs of reorganisation, redundancies and plant closures and to set up provisions in the balance sheet against which future costs can be charged. But in 1990, TI was widely criticised in the City for taking the practice to the limits of what was acceptable. Fair value provisions are usually set up soon after an acquisition and released over 18 months. In its 1989 accounts TI made Pounds 92m of fair value provisions, some Pounds 59m of which related to 'additional' goodwill write-offs relating to its 1988 acquisitions. The 'additional' provision was more than half that year's pre-tax profits of Pounds 112m. Critics said these costs, referred to as a major rationalisation of manufacturing facilities, systems and organisational structures in the 1989 accounts, might have been better treated as exceptionals or operating costs in what was by than an on-going busi-ness. Mr Lewinton and Mr Garner insist there was nothing wrong with this treatment  - and indeed Price Waterhouse, TI's auditors, did not qualify the accounts. 'We had always had an agreement with our auditors that we would not rush to finalise provisions in one balance sheet,' said Mr Garner. The reasoning behind this 'second bite' at the provisions had, however, been poorly communicated to the City. Some analysts have argued there is more to TI's second bite. First of all, TI had 11 months after the acquisition of Bundy, in April 1988, before the auditors signed off the 1988 accounts during which to identify potential write-offs. It also had an opportunity before the bid, which was agreed, and allowed TI to do full due diligence on Bundy. Mr Garner said that the opportunity for further restructuring, and therefore additional provisions, only came to light once senior members of the Bundy board left nearly a year after the acquisition and fresh ideas from more junior executives surfaced. The debate is not academic as it has implications for TI's cash flow. TI's unbroken record of strongly positive funds generation since 1986 would be severely dented if some of its past provisions were treated as on-going operating costs. In 1989, for instance, a tougher accounting treatment of the second Bundy provision would have meant TI's operations were actually a drain on funds. TI argues that debate about its accounting practices is of limited value. It now communicated properly with the City and in any case it the Dowty offer included a full cash alternative, Mr Garner said. Furthermore if TI were successful it said it would make only one set of provisions which would be clearly identified against what they would be applied. But Dowty shareholders contemplating the share offer, like TI's own shareholders, have considerable interest in the value of the predator's paper. Few would question Mr Lewinton's achievement in transforming TI since 1986 or the quality of the company he has created. However there is also no doubt that acquisition accounting has helped TI maintain the kind of earnings per share growth which fund managers 'in the 1980s . . . wanted companies to deliver . . . above all else', in the words of Mr Terry Smith, head of UK research at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew in his introduction to a study of the art, which was published last year. For the moment, however, the market appears content with TI's accounting, signalling its continued love affair with the promise of further earnings growth, which Mr Lewinton said would resume after 1993 following a successful bid. Supporting this view of the quality of TI, Moody's Investors Service, the US credit rating agency, yesterday confirmed TI's A1 rating.</p>

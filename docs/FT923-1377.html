			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / International Company News: Goldman Sachs' Dollars 1.15bn secret is out GOLDMAN SACHS, the US investment bank whose financial results have long been a closely-guarded secret, has finally been revealed as the most consistently profitable firm on Wall Street, making a pre-tax profit of Dollars 1.15bn in the 1991 fiscal year. The figure was revealed in this week's edition of Investment Dealers' Digest, a US financial magazine, which obtained a copy of a memorandum distributed by the firm over the summer to potential investors in a Dollars 400m issue of debt securities. Goldman is the last big privately-owned partnership on Wall Street and as such is not required to publish its financial statements. Its position at or near the top of most Wall Street league tables means it has long been one of America's most successful investment banks, and thus known to be extremely profitable. However, the degree of financial success revealed by the memorandum has surprised some analysts. The Dollars 1.15bn earned in the year to last November was well ahead of the pre-tax profits of rivals like Morgan Stanley and Salomon, while figures for the years 1987 to 1991 also showed the firm outstripping its rivals. However, in the first six months of the current year it made Dollars 662m, down 12 per cent on the same period of 1991 and below both Salomon and Merrill Lynch. Its revenues for the half year, net of interest expenses, came to Dollars 1.91bn, down from Dollars 1.96bn. Revenues from market-making and principal transactions - investing for the firm's own account - came to Dollars 1.5bn, down slightly from 1991. Commissions and fees totalled Dollars 410m.</p>

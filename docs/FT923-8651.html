			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / Paper hopes go through the shredder: How Continental 'green' laws are hampering recycling MR Peter Williams, chief executive of David S. Smith, the company that collects and recycles almost a quarter of the UK's waste paper, says he is watching his industry 'go down the pan'. In recent months he has campaigned vigorously to air his concerns about the deteriorating competitiveness of the UK paper packaging industry. He argues that the deterioration stems not from the recession but from environmental legislation introduced by several countries in mainland Europe - most notably Germany. A glut of cheap waste paper across the Channel has enabled Continental recycling companies to obtain their raw materials more cheaply than their counterparts in the UK (see graph). That allows them significantly to undercut David S. Smith's prices. In a letter to Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, in April, Mr Williams urged the government to take action to address a situation of 'crisis proportions'. He warned that the profitability of the industry had plunged, capacity was being cut, and - in contrast to all other European countries - the UK's paper recycling rate was actually falling. If nothing is done, he predicts that the industry will shrink by up to 20 per cent by the end of the decade, with the balance of trade being Pounds 1bn to the worse. Moreover, the government's target of recycling 25 per cent of all household waste by the year 2000 would be unattainable because of lack of capacity, he told Mr Heseltine in a subsequent meeting. Such talk may sound alarmist, but others echo his concerns. Mr Bryan Bateman, director of business and the environment at the British Paper and Board Industry Federation, the trade body, says: 'The problems affecting this particular sector arise because of the singularities of the German legislation and the differences in raw-material prices that the respective countries now enjoy. 'Corresponding legislative thrusts in France and Holland have mitigated the effects in their countries. But there is no desire or capability to have similar legislation in the UK.' Although other sectors of the packaging industry have felt ripples from the stone that the Germans have thrown into the recycling pond, the UK paper industry is particularly vulnerable because of its dependence on recycled materials to sustain its competitiveness. In the 1960s and 1970s, large parts of the UK paper industry were destroyed by their general uncompetitiveness against the large-scale Nordic manufacturers. Then after extensive rationalisation and investment, the industry recovered strongly through the 1980s and was greatly helped by tapping into a cheap source of recycled materials from Britain's 'urban forests'. Almost 60 per cent of the 5m tonnes of paper and board produced in the UK each year now uses recycled paper - a far higher utilisation rate than in almost every other industrialised country. But because the UK imports another 4m tonnes of paper each year, its recycling rate as a proportion of total consumption is only 33 per cent - one of the lowest in Europe. Mr Bateman argues that the UK could realistically collect another 1m tonnes of paper a year but that the recycling rate can be substantially increased only by expanding manufacturing capacity. 'But that means increasing investment which can only be funded by generating profitability in a stable market,' he says. One example of how difficult it can be to plan substantial investment programmes is provided by SCA, the Swedish paper company, which is contemplating investing about Pounds 250m in a newsprint mill, using recycled paper, at Aylesford in Kent. SCA's calculations are complicated by disagreements over proposed government subsidies, a surge of imports of cheap Canadian newsprint manufactured from virgin pulp - diverted from US markets because of state environmental regulations stipulating set percentages for recycled materials in newspapers  -and the prospect of four German newsprint mills due to start production soon. They will soak up surplus local recycled paper. Such investments would be aided if the UK were to follow the German route and in effect force local authorities and industry to collect a greater proportion of waste for re-use. That would have the effect of reducing prices for raw materials, guaranteeing a reliable source of supply, enabling investment decisions to be taken within a stable framework and allowing the UK industry to compete on level terms with Continental competitors. However, the UK government shows no signs of doing any such thing. It harbours serious misgivings about the environmental impact of the German system, arguing that more energy is consumed in collecting materials than is recovered from recycling them. Ideologically it also prefers market-based solutions to legislative or administrative ones. It is contemplating what incentives it could introduce. Some industry observers suggest that raising the costs of tipping recyclable materials in landfill sites or imposing a levy on packaging products to subsidise recycling schemes would have beneficial effects. Others propose removing value added tax from recycled products to encourage greater consumer demand - although it is unlikely that the Treasury would approve. Whatever it decides, the government will have to act soon. A recent survey by Friends of the Earth, the environmental pressure group, of 402 waste-collection authorities in England and Wales estimated that the recycling rate for all household waste is just 4.4 per cent, up from 2.6 per cent the year before, but below the government's estimates in the 1990 environment white paper. The group commented that most local authorities would find it near-impossible to achieve the government's suggested 25 per cent recycling rate because of a lack of end markets for recycled materials. It urged the government to tip the balance in favour of recycling by introducing a national waste strategy. Unless the government does so, Mr Williams is fearful for the future of the recycling industry. 'The impact of the German environmental legislation has been to give the German paper industry a significant cost/price advantage over the UK industry through indirect subsidies,' he says. 'The situation is really quite incredible. The German industry will move ahead while the British industry will be devastated.'</p>

			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / International Company News: Xerox shows 10% gain in net profit to Dollars 128m XEROX, the US document-processing group, yesterday unveiled a 10 per cent improvement in first-quarter net profits on a 3 per cent increase in revenues. Net income for the three months ended March 31 totalled Dollars 128m, or Dollars 1.10 a fully diluted share, against Dollars 116m, or Dollars 1, in last year's first quarter. Revenues were Dollars 3.31bn, compared with Dollars 3.2bn. Income from the group's document-processing business was Dollars 113m, up 3 per cent from the previous year. Revenues also rose 3 per cent to Dollars 3.3bn. Mr Paul Allaire, chairman, said sales of less expensive copiers and decentralised electronic printers continued to show strong growth worldwide. However, the company's overall performance was hurt by the weak economic climate in Japan and some parts of Europe. During the latest quarter, Xerox cut about 1,000 jobs as part of the company's previously announced plans to reduce its workforce by about 2,500. Mr Allaire said the effect of the total reduction would be reflected in Xerox's financial results later in the year. Earnings from Xerox's insurance and financial services operations rose to Dollars 66m in the quarter from Dollars 47m, though revenues dipped to Dollars 944m from Dollars 1bn a year ago. The company, which has been moving away from real estate and third-party transactions, attributed the decline in revenues to strategic changes in property and casualty insurance operations. Interest and headquarters expenses rose to Dollars 51m from Dollars 41m, limiting earnings from insurance and financial services to Dollars 15m against Dollars 6m last year.</p>

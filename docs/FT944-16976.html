			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Business and the Law: First cases clarify role of Efta Court  -Legal Briefs The kind of issues which will occupy the Efta Court, set up to settle disputes relating to the European Economic Area Agreement, are becoming clearer, as the Geneva-based tribunal takes on its first cases. The Swedish Supreme Court has asked it for a ruling on the application of Swedish procedural rules in a case brought by a UK company against Swedish defendants. The Supreme Court wants to know whether requiring the UK company to provide security for costs - a deposit of money against legal costs if the company loses - is contrary to the EEA Agreement, and in particular the prohibition of discrimination on grounds of nationality, since no corresponding requirement may be imposed on Swedish nationals. Two cases concerning television advertising in Sweden have also been referred to the Efta court by the Swedish Market Court. The Market Court has asked for an advisory opinion on whether the EEA agreement and the EU directive on 'Television without frontiers' prevent action being taken against TV advertisements shown in Sweden but transmitted from elsewhere in the EEA.</p>

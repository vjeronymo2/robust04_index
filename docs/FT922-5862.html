			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Washington offers EC new trade proposals THE US last night made what were described as 'new proposals' to the European Community designed to help incorporate last week's reform of the Common Agricultural Policy into a new global trade agreement. Ms Carla Hills, the US trade representative reporting during a break in discussions with a visiting EC delegation in Washington, would not disclose the details of the proposals, nor would she characterise the EC reaction to the terms beyond an initial commitment to review them. But they were designed, she said, 'to bridge the gap' between reform of the CAP and the terms of the draft Uruguay Round trade agreement drawn up by Mr Arthur Dunkel, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt). She said the EC team, led by Mr Frans Andriessen, trade commissioner, had made clear its belief that last week's CAP reform opened the way for a Uruguay Round breakthrough. She implied there was still a gap between the new CAP changes to internal EC market supports and continuing distorting effects on international trade that are a central concern of the Dunkel draft. However, she described yesterday's exchanges variously as 'good' and 'creative.' She was joined in the talks by Mr James Baker, US secretary of state, and Mr Edward Madigan, secretary of agriculture. Meanwhile, the American Farm Bureau, whose support is considered vital for a Gatt deal to go through Congress, has responded bitterly to EC officials' suggestions that the US should make further concessions in Gatt. 'The EC reforms fall far short of the proposed agricultural agreement put forward by Arthur Dunkel and further short of what the Bureau would expect to achieve in the talks,' Mr Dean Kleckner, the body's president, said. A spokesman for Cargill, the international grain trader, said the company was still assessing the CAP reform proposals. But a favourable review of the deal had been received from its European office.</p>

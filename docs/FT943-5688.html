			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / UK Company News: US giant takes small house American giant gobbles up English miniature and, contrary to mythic expectation, everyone says they are all going to live happily together ever after. This was the tale being told yesterday as Stanhome, a US marketer and distributor of consumer products, giftware and collectibles, added another collectible line to its collection. It made a recommended cash offer of 160p a share for Lilliput, the Cumbria-based maker of hand-painted miniature china cottages, casting a ray of sunshine on to a niche in the small housing market. The bid values Lilliput, which floated less than a year ago in October, at Pounds 37.2m. At the flotation price of 135p it was valued at Pounds 31.4m. Yesterday morning the shares opened at 92p. As a result Mr John Russell, Lilliput chairman and chief executive, said that he would have done the deal no differently in an ideal world. He felt he had fulfilled his obligations to shareholders and, because Lilliput will stand alone within Stanhome, to the future of the company and its staff. Mr Russell, who had 600,000 shares, is set to make Pounds 1m gross, while Mr DG Tate, the group's founder who had some 3.8m shares, will gain about Pounds 6m. Both men made substantial amounts at the time of the float. At the time of the morning's announcement, Stanhome had received acceptances in respect of 10.3m shares, or 44.4 per cent, from directors, their wives, North of England Ventures and Lazard Ventures. By 4.30pm Stanhome spoke for 57.9 per cent, having bought a further 13.5 per cent at 158p. Stanhome has three divisions: Lilliput will fall within Enesco Worldwide Giftware, which in 1993 contributed 49 per cent of the Dollars 751m (Pounds 485m) group sales. Enesco designs and markets giftware, licensed lines and collectibles and sells them through some 50,000 retail outlets mostly in the US. Mr Bill Seawright, Stanhome chief executive, said most of its collectibles, in particular its Precious Moments line, were made in China. Lilliput's products are made in the UK, an important factor for the east Asian market. There would be synergies in US distribution - cottages are 'hot' in the US, according to Mr Seawright - and Stanhome wanted a 'neat, tidy' company as a foothold in Europe, a market it wanted to expand into. He said that collectibles was a growing market, especially in the US and particularly for women.</p>

			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PACIFIC PARAMETERS: THAILAND  </P> <P> "It is also being realized that in these days of the global village any  effective development of Europe cannot take place without the cooperation of  the United States. Those within the European Community who favor a policy of  economic confrontation with America are failing to keep in step with changing  times."  </P> <P>  -- Bangkok Post editorial.  </P> <P> "The pledged withdrawal of U.S. fighter jets from the Philippines should allay  the fears of those Filipino citizens who were concerned that their country was  destined to remain forever as a fixed- position U.S. aircraft carrier. However,  this accomplished, the negotiations should now move cautiously in fixing a  timetable for further pullouts. Above all, time is needed to verify that Asian  security -- especially regional security -- is likely to remain as unthreatened  as it is today."  </P> <P>  -- Bangkok Post editorial.  </P></p>

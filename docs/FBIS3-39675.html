			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed GGD: "Kooijmans Wants Sarajevo Under UN </F> Control"; as released by The Hague ANP Database]    [Text] Hilversum/Paris, 22 Feb (ANP) -- Netherlands Foreign  Minister Pieter Kooijmans is in favor of placing Sarajevo under  UN control as quickly as possible. The government spokesman  declared Monday evening [21 February] on NOS [Netherlands  Broadcasting Foundation] television that the withdrawal of heavy  weapons around the Bosnian capital had brought a decent  settlement within reach.    Kooijmans said that following the positive outcome of the  NATO ultimatum, the international community must not sit back  and relax. "There must be a follow-up," said the minister,  pointing to the proposals laid out in the original peace plan  for Bosnia-Herzegovina. Both Sarajevo (United Nations) and  Mostar (European Union) should have to be placed under  multinational control over a two-year period. "During this  time, it must be possible to reach a solution for these two  cities," estimated Kooijmans.    The Netherlands minister does not believe that opting for UN  control would mean agreeing actually to carve up the Bosnian  capital. Kooijmans pointed out that Sarajevo was not a divided  city two years ago before civil war broke out, but rather a city  where different population groups lived separately in their own  quarters of the city. In his opinion, UN supervision must serve  precisely to prevent the division of the city. "The United  Nations must ensure that there can be freedom of movement  throughout the whole of Sarajevo."    Moreover, Kooijmans believes the United Nations should also  guarantee free access to Sarajevo for people and products during  the administrative takeover.  (In a televised speech given Monday evening in Paris, French  President Francois Mitterrand had also called for Sarajevo to be  placed under UN authority -- ANP editor's note).    (According to Western diplomatic sources, the members of the  UN Security Council are considering a resolution to this effect.  In addition, there is talk of establishing three "safe areas,"  namely the cities of Mostar, Vitez, and Maglaj -- ANP editor's  note).</p>

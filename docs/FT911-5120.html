			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / International Bonds: Busy day for sterling new issues NEW ISSUE activity in the international bond market was centred on sterling yesterday, with four contrasting deals testing demand for floating rate, subordinated and straight sterling paper. In the first floating-rate note issue since October last year, Woolwich Building Society offered Pounds 100m three-year paper lead managed by UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. The notes pay a margin of  1/8 point over the three-month London interbank offered rate, and was reoffered to investors at the fixed price of 99.70. At this level the paper pays a discounted margin of 25 basis points over Libor, a small premium over existing deals in the secondary market. Participants in the deal reported firm demand from UK institutional investors, although a few houses declined to participate on the grounds that the fees - 4 basis points for underwriting - were insufficient. If the deal performs well over the next few days it may open the way for further floating-rate note issuance by UK building societies, which have concentrated on fixed-rate funding this year. National Westminster Bank's Pounds 100m issue of subordinated paper, solely underwritten by Natwest Capital Markets, was the first 10-year subordinated issue in sterling since 1988. The issue counts as Tier II capital for the issuer under the Basle Guidelines on international bank capital adequacy and other UK banks may follow if they judge the issue to be a success. The paper carries an 11 3/4 per cent coupon and was priced to yield a substantial 135 basis points over the benchmark 10-year gilt. NatWest reported strong demand from European institutional accounts, attracted by the high yield on paper rated Aa and AA-2 respectively by Moody's Investors Service and Standard &amp; Poor's. Export-Import Bank of Japan came with the first issue by a Japanese government guaranteed issuer since 1988. The deal was, in part, a positive response to the Bank of England's decision last month to allow Japanese banks to act as lead managers on sterling transactions. The borrower also found an attractive swap arbitrage between sterling and floating rate dollars. The Pounds 150m 10-year deal was lead managed by Warburg Securities and co-lead managed by IBJ. The paper carries a coupon of 10 3/4 per cent and was priced to yield 46 basis points over the 10 per cent UK government bond 2001. The yield spread places Ex-Im Bank alongside supranational borrowers such as the Asian Development Bank. Demand from UK and European institutional investors ensured rapid placement of the deal, with the yield spread over gilts closing to 44 basis points by late afternoon. At the shorter end of the yield curve, Credit Local de France followed its debut in the sterling sector last month with a Pounds 100m three-year issue lead managed by Credit Suisse First Boston. The bonds pay a coupon of 11 per cent and were priced to yield 37 basis points over the benchmark three-year gilt. The borrowers' Pounds 100m five-year deal launched last month offered a yield spread of 40 basis points over UK government paper. Elsewhere, Japan Finance Corporation for Municipal Enterprises came with a 10-year Dollars 150m deal lead managed by IBJ. The bonds were priced to yield 50 basis points over US Treasury paper, a pick up of only around 3 basis points over more liquid deals by compar able issuers such as Japan Development Bank. However, demand for sovereign-backed dollar paper at this maturity is strong and from an issue price of 99.25 the paper traded up to 99.40 bid. Waldner, the Chicago-based risk management group, launched its second 'increasable yield' Ecu bond issue via Swiss Bank Corporation. The proceeds of the issue are invested by Waldner in futures and options funds, part of the proceeds of which will be passed on to bond holders. The bonds pay a minimum coupon of 4 1/2 per cent which may be increased, depending on Waldner's investment performance. The issue is backed by a holding of medium-term notes issued by SBC and carries a triple-A credit rating as a result. The indicated size of the issue is Ecu50m to Ecu100m. The deal will be priced on May 8.</p>

LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori said, "It's an  irresponsible way to do things. The cabinet should take much of  the blame."    Mori told reporters that the coalition partners should have  consolidated their opinions before the announcement because the  tax system deeply affects the Japanese people.    "If it was decision-making on international relations, it  might have brought about a major disaster," Mori said.    Earlier in the day, leaders of the coalition parties agreed  to renounce the tax plan Hosokawa announced at an early Thursday  morning news conference. It called for abolishing the 3 percent  consumption tax and instead introducing a new indirect tax on  sales of goods and services.</p>

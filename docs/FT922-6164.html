			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Letter: London as financial centre of EC Sir, If London is to have any hope of becoming the EC financial centre there is no more than a four-week window of opportunity to clear up the Lloyd's mess. The Council of Lloyd's is caught in a cruel dilemma. If the LMX spiral practices are legal and defended as such then the effect will be even more disastrous than if they are declared illegal. The sheer inequity of this practice will soon be obvious to all. It cannot be kept hidden that the LMX 'pyramid' process is flagrantly to the benefit of the brokers (and Lloyd's indirectly) at the expense of the Names. Condoning this practice, even if legal, will mean that the traditions of the City of London render it unacceptable as a financial centre because exploitation is not sufficiently ruled out. It is also very likely that the 1982 Lloyd's Act will be challenged in the European Courts of Justice as being contrary to basic human rights. To expect Lloyd's to regulate itself is like asking turkeys to regulate Christmas. The case will be an acute embarrassment to the government, which will be put in the impossible position of having to condone dubious practices. At this point it will become obvious that London is not fit to be the financial centre of Europe. Allowing turkeys to behave as ostriches will not solve the dilemma. It may just not be too late for resolute action by the government. Inquiries that are too late in reporting are not sufficient resolute action.

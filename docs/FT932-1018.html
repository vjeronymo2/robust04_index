			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Orphans of the storm The run of ill-fortune continues. Mr John Major is heading the one-damn-thing-after-another administration. No sooner does it pick itself up than along comes a clearly malicious Fate to knock it down. Like the flying Dutchman, Britain's ghostly ship of state, captained by a spectre, is lost in a world of its own, wandering from storm to storm, forever trying to make a connection with reality, forever failing. The longest recent period of serious, purposeful, respected government that I can recall lasted about four days. It happened last week. The prime minister was the beneficiary of a run of favourable publicity for his new chancellor of the exchequer, whose down-to-earth sentiments are reported on the page opposite. A series of encouraging economic indicators helped. Mr Major's spirits were further uplifted by an uncharacteristic aggressiveness in his own performance at question time in the Commons. That seemed to put paid to the Labour leader, Mr John Smith. Perhaps it was a turning point. After all, the principal event of this week was the meeting of heads of government of the European Community in Copenhagen. Mr Major is at his best at summits, and by his own lights he had a good one. He managed to sell out the Bosnian Muslims and slap the Germans in the face simultaneously, by thwarting the plan of the latter to provide the arms with which the ethnically-cleansed might defend themselves. His stand against social Europe may or may not have struck a chord in Denmark, but it seems to have done him some good with the anti-Maastricht wing of his party back home. Alas, the effect was ruined before the performance started. Mr Michael Heseltine was struck by a heart attack while in Venice. We do not yet know how soon, or whether, the president of the board of trade will return to his duties, but his absence, even for a few mid-summer months, will be damaging to the government. It will be worse still if his doctors advise him not to return. Mr Heseltine has his imperfections, but he is an experienced, grown-up politician in a cabinet of relative newcomers. When the news came it seemed to his colleagues as if there was no end to the run of ill-luck that has dogged Mr Major and his crew since Black Wednesday. The Conservatives then became entangled in a web partly of their own making. They were accused of accepting funds from people who wanted to influence them, some of these being foreigners, some of them crooks. This was hilarious coming from a Labour party that is governed by trade unions. Brother does not give contributions unto brother without expecting a dominant vote in return. Mr Smith was elected leader of his party by professional influence-peddlers. The Maxwell money that went to Labour did not come from an honest man. Yet the Tories would have done better if they had agreed to publish the names of their wealthier benefactors. That they will not indicates that they have something to hide. I cannot get excited about this. British corruption, like British hypocrisy, has always been conducted at a certain level, the equilibrium of which is difficult to disturb. It is nothing like so gross as the Italian method, and nowhere so public as in the United States. Of course you can buy a meeting with a minister (or his opposition shadow). Invitations to Downing Street are a little more expensive. Naturally there is a price for OBEs (Opposition Buyers Excluded), MBEs (Many Buy Each), CBEs (Cash Before Everything), Knighthoods and a seat in the old folks' home known as the House of Lords. What you cannot do is make an open purchase, a stated deal, an explicit bargain. The cheque goes to the Conservative party; the gong may or may not be in the post. The pretence that no transaction ever takes place is an integral part of this delicate traditional process. The parliamentary row about these matters will have confirmed to those TV viewers who did not switch channels that our politicians are an unseemly lot. To that extent it will damage all parties, but the likelihood is that it is the Conservatives who have lost the most. Greater buckets of sleaze have been thrown at them by Labour than they have managed to throw in return. The connection with the fugitive Mr Asil Nadir is not easily defended. It is here that Mr Michael Mates comes into the picture. If his resignation yesterday had been the only event of an otherwise untroubled season it could be written off as of no significance save to the hapless former minister of state for Northern Ireland. But Mr Mates enjoyed too close a connection with Mr Nadir, or the latter's public relations adviser, not to mention the receipt of at least one favour. He travelled too near the line that divides legitimate dealings with interested parties from the secret world of influence-peddling. He is, I am sure, innocent of any impropriety, but that is not how it looks. He has therefore further damaged the Conservatives. Who, in this of all weeks, will believe that his case was a one-off? Not those who remember Mr David Mellor, another minister who was obliged to resign after benefiting from the favours of others. In both cases, the downfall followed some weeks during which the prime minister was supposed to be adamant that his ministers would be defended, although he was less adamant about Mr Mates than about Mr Mellor. As with Mr Norman Lamont the agony was unnecessarily prolonged. It really is time that Mr Major learned his lesson. A ministerial resignation is always painful, particularly when it appears to be the result of a media vendetta. But Mr Lamont should have gone on Black Wednesday, Mr Mellor when his acceptance of outsiders' hospitality was broadcast, Mr Mates at least a week ago. The prime minister is the responsible party. In each case he should have known that resignation was the inevitable outcome. Everyone else did. A few days ago, before Lady Thatcher called a halt, some Conservatives were certain that Mr Major himself would be next for the chop. I have no more idea than anyone else whether he will survive. What is clear is that he is doomed to sail yet awhile in the nether-world of government without authority. Only a series of events - good events, happy events, successful events - can put him back in genuine control of the nation's affairs.</p>

			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Zimbabwe MPs pass bill to seize land ZIMBABWE'S parliament yesterday passed a controversial land bill which will allow the state to seize land from white commercial farmers for redistribution to black peasants. Reuter reports from Harare. But the 150-member parliament dropped some elements of the Land Acquisition Bill which a parliamentary legal committee said violated the constitution. One deleted clause, denying farmers the right to challenge compensation payments in court, was hotly contested by Zimbabwe's 4,500 commercial farmers. A clause that empowers the agriculture minister to designate land for redistribution was retained despite farmers' protests. The government says it plans to reallocate 5.5m hectares, just over half the white farming community's land, to hundreds of thousands of peasants living in overcrowded conditions.</p>

			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / UK Company News: ICD sells 75% stake in Database to management INTERNATIONAL Communication &amp; Data, the USM-quoted provider of direct marketing data, is disposing of 75.1 per cent of its interest in lossmaking The Database Group, to existing management and financial backers. ICD, which has changed its year end to May 31, also announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 491,000 for the 12 months to February 28 against profits of Pounds 1.14m. The result includes losses of Pounds 415,000 from TDG and Pounds 1.05m of exceptional charges. Turnover was Pounds 8.8m (Pounds 9.6m). Mr David Cicurel, chairman, said that the three months to May were a period of low seasonal activity which usually traded at a loss. The results for the 15 months would therefore include such losses as well as provisions in respect of group properties and the effect of a new accounting policy to record the value of the databases. TDG, which comprises the businesses of Lindor and Compass and the consulting arm of ICD, is being sold for cash to Quayshelfco 430, formed for the purpose of the acquisition by Mr Les O'Reilly, who will resign as a director of ICD on completion of the sale. The disposal, which will allow significant head office economies, should restore profitability, Mr Cicurel said.</p>

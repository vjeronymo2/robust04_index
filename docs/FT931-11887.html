			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / Trident Dock Contest: Work for non-MoD organisations to account for 40 per cent of activity in 1992-93 at Rosyth AT THE Rosyth yard, work for organisations other than the Ministry of Defence will account for nearly 40 per cent of activity in 1992-93 and 20 per cent of its expected turnover of Pounds 165m, Richard Evans and James Buxton write. The gap is due to the high-value nature of much of the MoD work. Some 800 of the yard's 4,100 employees are permanently engaged in non-MoD activities. Diversification began soon after Babcock Thorn took over. Mr Allan Macpherson, now director of manufacturing, wanted to market the high level of skills in the dockyard and initially exploited the craftsmanship of the cabinetmakers whose main job had been fitting out cabins on warships. That led to the creation of a furniture and joinery business which now supplies furniture for the retail and the timeshare markets. At Devonport dockyard, 23 per cent of turnover last year came from contracts won through competitive tender, half of that on work unrelated to defence. It included yacht building and refitting, and engine servicing for British Rail. A contract has just been won to build specialist trailers to transport Russian nuclear warheads for dismantling. The main targets being sought in the Plymouth area are high-tech and light engineering groups. Companies that have moved to the area in recent years are Toshiba, the television manufacturer; Murata, the Japanese-owned producer of ceramic capacitators; and Wrigley, the US-owned chewing gum producer.</p>

			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Survey of Greece (3): The piper calls the tune - Relations with Europe IN THE wealthier parts of Athens, the mink coats come out during the short spells of winter weather. The children of the wealthy - there are plenty of them - while away their time in coffee bars or parade round the city in expensive cars. House buyers still carry suitcases full of drachma to complete cash purchases for properties which have recently risen to London-style prices. At times it is hard to reconcile life in Greece with the official statistics: on a wealth per head basis Greece is now the poorest country in the EC. It also has the worst economic health record in the Community. It has been saved from financial pneumonia only by emergency treatment from Brussels, in the form of a recently approved Ecu2.2bn loan - granted on the strictest terms yet imposed on a member state. 1990 was the year when the EC finally ran out of patience with Greek governments which seemed either unwilling or unable to put the country's financial affairs in some sort of order. Early last year Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, wrote a terse letter to the then 'ecumenical' government. He said the deteriorating economic situation in Greece threatened the future not only of the country but also jeopardised future developments within the EC. Greece, said Mr Delors, was lagging behind the Community to the point where the EC's 'course towards the single market, monetary union and European unification is in danger of being permanently undermined.' Greece's creditworthiness was increasingly at risk due to a rapidly rising public debt and other imbalances in the economy. 'We think it indispensable that drastic measures be quickly taken to make clear the country's willingness to reduce these imbalances for good,' said Mr Delors. The direct language of the communication broke the delicate protocol the Commission employs in its dealings with sovereign EC governments. The EC was angry that Greece had failed to abide by the terms of a Dollars 1.7bn EC emergency loan made in 1985. The message this time was clear: if Greece did not put its economy in order, then the country risked being left behind by the rest of the Community. The new EC loan - finally approved in February this year - sets the parameters of Greek economic policy for the next three years. The loan is in three tranches and is set on what the Commission describes as 'strict and comprehensive' conditions. These include bringing inflation down from 17 to 7 per cent, cutting central government borrowing from 17 per cent of GDP to 1.5 per cent in the 1990-93 period, a 10 per cent reduction in public sector employment, curbs on public sector pay rises and a radical broadening of the tax base. The government is in desperate need of the loan to cover a current account deficit which totalled Dollars 3.2bn in 1990. The loan is also necessary to ensure Greece's continuing creditworthiness as it goes to the market for an estimated Dollars 3.6bn of foreign borrowing this year. Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, the Prime Minister, denies that the terms of the loan constitute an infringement of Greek sovereignty. 'What appears to have been a set of conditions imposed from outside was in fact our policy,' says Mr Mitsotakis. 'We told Brussels to tell us these things. Our economic policy is a very courageous one and has various political and social risks attached to it. But we are determined to carry out these vital reforms.' Some Greek officials admit that the fact that Brussels is seen to be imposing its terms on the future course of the economy has made life easier for the government. In the divisive world of Greek politics it would have found it hard to act alone. There could have been a series of damaging strikes and social chaos. There was some disquiet within EC ranks about the loan. Mr Mitsotakis says agreement was reached only after consultations 'at a very high level'. At a meeting of EC finance ministers in Milan last December it was suggested that Greece should turn to the IMF for help. But Mr Delors and others have argued that a solution to Greece's problems should be found 'within the family' of the EC. If Brussels shows signs of impatience with Athens, then many Greeks also feel that the rich, well-developed countries of the EC do not have sufficient regard for their country's particular problems - whether they are ones of geography, politics or culture. 'We Greeks have been slow to learn the intricacies of dealing with Brussels and have had difficulty in co-ordinating our policies,' says one official. 'For that we are penalised.' Like other countries on the EC's periphery, Greece feels it must be granted some special treatment if, in the words of the Brussels bureaucrats, there is to be 'a level playing pitch' between EC members. On the macroeconomic level, Greece cannot be said to have made the most of the opportunities offered by its 10-year EC membership. In 1981 Greek per capita GDP was 58 per cent of the EC average: it is now 51 per cent. Large inflows of EC money in the early 1980s were not used to make the fundamental readjustments necessary in the economy. Rather than modernise the agricultural sector by investing in agribusiness industries, funds were used to import new cars or buy videos. As happened in several other EC member countries, there was no proper supervision of spending. EC monies helped the former socialist government of Mr Andreas Papandreou to carry on the tradition of making political appointments to the civil service and give electorally beneficial pay rises. Mr Costas Simitis was national economy minister during the middle years of the Papandreou era but resigned in 1987 when the former government, faced with an election, abandoned its austerity programme. He admits that mistakes have been made and that as a result Greece only has 'a weak voice' within the EC. 'The trouble now is that the government does not have any specific plan as to how it will bring about the reforms Brussels is asking for. For instance, it has no idea about how to levy taxes on farmers,' says Mr Simitis. There is little talk of the unified market and 1992 in Greece. Ecu7bn of EC structural funds covering the 1989-93 period may not be fully utilised due to the lack of public and private matching investment. Of more immediate concern are the implementation of wage agreements and bringing down inflation. Greek attitudes have changed. Greeks are firmly in favour of EC membership, even if many still refer to Europe as 'over there'. 'We must make sacrifices and fight hard to play our full part in Europe,' says a Greek official. 'If we fail now, we risk being permanently marginalised.'</p>

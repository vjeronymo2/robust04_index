			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OTTERMAN QUITS TO GET 'OUT OF LOS ANGELES'  </P> <P> Saying he wants "to get out of Los Angeles," Donald H. Otterman, city manager  of La Canada Flintridge, announced Tuesday that he will resign in June to  become a city manager in Oregon.  </P> <P> "I've been with the city for eight years," said Otterman, 42, who has served as  manager for the last five. "It's time to move on."  </P> <P> Born in Whittier and a Glendale resident for 21 years, Otterman said he and his  wife have talked for some time about moving to Oregon or Northern California to  raise their 8-year-old twin sons.  </P> <P> Otterman cited "congestion, too many people, too much smog" as his reasons for  leaving the area. He said he began "looking earnestly" for a new position three  to four months ago.  </P> <P> Otterman will leave his post June 15 to become city manager of Keizer, a  6-year-old city in a farming community and a rapidly growing suburb outside  Salem. His salary will be comparable to the $61,200 a year he presently earns,  Otterman said.  </P> <P> Keizer Mayor Andrew Orcutt said Otterman was selected from among 97 applicants  as "the top choice" of a five-member candidate selection committee. Orcutt said  committee members particularly liked Otterman's management style and noted the  similarities between La Canada Flintridge and Keizer, which is about the same  in size and population, as well as in political organization and development  patterns.  </P> <P> Orcutt said Otterman impressed him as "laid-back and relaxed. It seems as  though he doesn't get too terribly upset at anything, yet he has a heavy enough  hand that if problems arise, he can take care of them."  </P> <P> Otterman, who is leaving a staff of 10, will take charge of 35 city employees  in Keizer, which also has its own police department.  </P> <P> As manager of a city in which two veteran conservative council members were  ousted last year by more progressive challengers, Otterman said his job has  become more difficult, but denied that the rivalries are a factor in his  leaving. "We may disagree, but I respect them," he said.  </P> <P> He said he counts among his greatest accomplishments the acquisition of two  large open-space areas in Cherry Canyon and the removal of unsightly overhead  high-tension lines, which are buried along Foothill Boulevard and Verdugo Road.  </P> <P> Issues that have raged during his tenure and still remain unsolved are what to  do with the proposed Sport Chalet commercial development and formation of a  redevelopment zone along the Foothill commercial strip.  </P> <P> "I really did like it here," Otterman said, then added in jest, "but I still  have two more council meetings to go through."  </P></p>

			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (21): Japan for beginners JAPAN is the second largest and one of the least understood economies in the world. To explain how its scandal-ridden financial sector can continue to finance the fastest growing industrial sector in the developed world requires more than a partial knowledge of its institutions. Takatoshi Ito's book (The Japanese Economy, MIT, Pounds 35.95) provides a worthwhile first step. The book gives an introduction to market economics, Japanese-style, starting with a history of the Tokugawa era of isolationism, the Meiji restoration and post-war drive for growth. Monetary, fiscal and industrial policies all merit chapters while the peculiar nature of the Japanese labour market is adequately covered. The book concludes with a discussion of US-Japan economic conflicts; the retail distribution system and import barriers; and asset prices and the stock market boom-bust cycle. undergraduates, confused executives and bemused US congressmen would all learn from this book.</p>

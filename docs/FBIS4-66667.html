			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Rut Yuval] </F>   [Text] For Rabbi Menahem Hacohen, the band of armed  brigands who holed up in Beit Yihud at the direction of Rabbi  'Uzi Meshulam stirred up a pain that had subsided in recent  years. Meshulam, says Hacohen, who once served in the Knesset,  is the best proof of the need for a law prescribing who may call  himself rabbi. "If 'Uzi Meshulam were just 'Uzi Meshulam, the  shame and the anger would be enough, but since he carries the  title rabbi, that adds a dimension to the whole thing."    Hacohen tried twice in the past to push through a bill to  regulate this unholy domain. Twice the religious ministers and  jurists blocked his bill. He has been caused anguish and rage  countless times when "all sorts of men who are as far from the  rabbinate as north is from south" have been presented or have  presented themselves as rabbis.    The founding of the state is usually marked as the starting  point for inflation in use of the title rabbi. Some ascribe this  to the rise in the number of seminaries. For lack of any other  proper title, seminary teachers are called "rabbis," and from  the moment they could obtain the title even without ordination  examinations or a practice period (a sort of working  apprenticeship for congregational rabbis that was customary in  the larger communities), the fence was breached. Rabbi Hacohen  sees two catalysts for the process: the ignorance of secular  Jews and the pursuit of trappings of respect by the religious.  Most people in the secular media do not know how to tell a rabbi  from a mezuzah salesman, but the beard, the black frock, and the  hat arouse in them a murmur of respect for the spirit of  grandfather's Israel (and sometimes even for a faint memory of  their father's house where, in the Yiddish style, the word "reb"  preceded every man's name). In that way, the title rabbi began  to be given in Israel, too, as a mark of courtesy to anyone who  served in public office and looked like a rabbi, with or without  any connection to rabbinic ordination.    In their wake came the religious media, particularly the  haredi, which found in it a means of honoring its worthies and  denigrating its foes. Agudat Yisra'el's journal HAMODI'A has  never used the title rabbi before the name of Shlomo Goren, whom  they detest, even though Goren is a completely legitimate rabbi;  exceptionally polite writers call him Mr. Shlomo Goren. In Degel  Hatorah's YATED NE'EMAN, he is called "rabbi" only in quotations  when, as often happens, his name is accompanied by the words  "buffoon" and "ignoramus." By contrast, every fourth rank party  activist, and even anyone who has gotten a few inches of column  space in advertisements, receives the honorific "rabbi" without  the slightest difficulty in both newspapers.    Menahem Hacohen was elected to the Knesset in 1973. "I  recall  at least six rabbis there, of whom only two were real rabbis:  Rabbi Kalman Kahane and 'Avdakh. All the rest, `Rabbi' Grus,  `Rabbi' Scheinman, `Rabbi' Porush and `Rabbi' Abramowitz, were  what I called `rebraff.' After that, there was `Rabbi' Lorenz  and `Rabbi' Verdiger and still others, and each had a frock. The  title rabbi stuck and they like it. Even today, the Knesset has  some men who call themselves `rabbi' but who have never gotten a  whiff of what it means to study Torah."    Early in his career, Hacohen thought he could change things.  "Like any young Jew entering the Knesset, I thought the world  could be fixed. I said to myself, `This is a rotten business,  anyone can call himself rabbi if he wants. It is charlatanism,  just plain fraud. Just as a physician cannot call himself a  doctor if he is not a doctor, a rabbi who is not ordained as a  rabbi cannot call himself rabbi. The situation has gotten to the  point where it is beginning to be a title of contempt.' I  thought that just as we need to regulate any title, we have to  protect the title rabbi, and for that you need a law.    "I never imagined that someone could be against such a law.  But every proposed bill goes through a coalition screening, and  the coalition leadership was against it. Zerah Verhaftig, who  was then Minister of Religious Affairs, and Justice Minister  Ya'aqov Shimshon Shapira told me they were against it. The  second time I presented the bill, the Minister of Religious  Affairs was Yitzhaq Rafa'el, who held it and held it and held  it. Eventually, the Justice Minister, Hayim Tzadoq, told me that  he was against passing it."    [Yuval] Why was it that this bill aroused opposition?    [Hacohen] First of all, it could have caused problems for  the  government with various factions because it raised the question  of how to deal with the Reform and Conservative movements. I  said, `You cannot discriminate on this. If it is a movement that  ordains rabbis, even if it is Reform, then you cannot take away  his title.' But the Ministry of Religious Affairs was afraid of  the problems that the entire process would create. The second  reason for opposition was the idea, why should they complicate  things with all sorts of Jews, both abroad and in the Knesset  itself, who were happy with the situation? After all, there were  men of all kinds calling themselves rabbi in the government and  in the coalition.    "I really do not know just how much of a rabbi Menahem  Hacohen is," snickers Knesset member [MK] Avraham Ravitz of  Degel Hatorah, and his snicker reveals something of the  basically problematic nature of the issue. "I am not speaking of  him personally, I do not know his past, but a man has to be  tested in certain subjects to be ordained a rabbi. Now, it  happens that there are rabbis in the community who are students  of brilliant sages but who have not gone to the trouble of  taking tests in these subjects because--it can even be matter of  principle, they are modest and humble--they did not want to have  the title and do not need it to get a rabbinic position. But  they can still be far greater masters than Menahem Hacohen, for  instance. Again, I am speaking of Menahem Hacohen as an example,  not personally.    "Look, we have levels upon levels determined according to a  man's knowledge and his moral character. We call both Rabbi  Elishav and Menahem Hacohen rabbi, but they are not on the same  level. It is like an elephant compared to a fly. I could tell  you that Rabbi Schach did not receive a rabbinic ordination;  does that mean he is not a Torah genius and we cannot call him  rabbi? And let us say that 'Uzi Meshulam brings me 20 rabbinic  degrees; I will tell him to cover himself with them on a night  when it is 20 degrees. That is all. None of us here will call  him rabbi."    The problems that secular Jews have in dealing with the  question of "who is a rabbi" are hardly less troubling for them  than they are for the haredim. True, Rabbi Ravitz contends that  for both him and the entire haredi community, "We know exactly  who is a rabbi and who is not, and believe me, it is so clear  and easy that I would almost say it is an exact science." Even  he, however, finds himself getting tripped up when he tries to  define who is a rabbi by ordination and who is a rabbi by earned  respect.    Ravitz: "I will give you myself as an example. I studied for  dozens of years in two seminaries but I never bothered to join  the rabbinate even though that would have been as easy for me as  breakfast. One day I was offered a rabbinic position and I  debated whether or not to take it. In the end, I did not take  it, but in the meantime, I went and got a rabbinic ordination,  which took me exactly two weeks. Does that mean I was not a  rabbi two weeks earlier and two weeks later I was? None of my  colleagues has any idea that I got a rabbinic ordination. I do  not hang the certificate in my office because it is not our  custom to do that. We do not have any interest in that."    [Yuval] So how do you know how to tell who is a rabbi?    [Ravitz] There are two ways: by knowledge of Torah and by  the  man's moral character and judgment.    [Yuval] Are Ori Zohar and Mordekhay Arnon rabbis by your  definition?    [Ravitz] It is hard for me to give you an exact answer. I  think that Ori, who has immersed himself in Torah for many  years, definitely can be called Rabbi Ori Zohar even though he  has not passed his ordination examinations. Perhaps Mordekhay  Arnon, too, even though he deals more with day to day affairs.  You see, I am starting to get tangled, but this does not  interest us very much and does not bother us.    [Yuval] Do you call Moshe Hayrash Mantori a rabbi?    [Ravitz] Despite all the sharp disagreements I have with  him,  I think it is possible to call him rabbi, because it seems to me  that he is a man who has studied for many years.    [Yuval] Arye Der'i?    [Ravitz] I do not know, it may be that he has an ordination.  He is no ignoramus, Arye, he studied for many years.    [Yuval] When you meet him, do you call him Rabbi Arye Der'i?    [Ravitz] When we happen to meet, in the Knesset, for  example,  I call him Arye, but when I appear before SHAS [Torah Observing  Sephardim] members and I know that they call him Rabbi Der'i, I  call him that too.    [Yuval] Is Avraham Shapira a rabbi?    [Ravitz] I really do not know.    [Yuval] It seems that even for all of you, there is some  confusion over the rabbinic qualifications of some rabbis.    [Ravitz] Do you know what we do to get out of this? We call  Shapira Reb Avrom. "Reb" is a kind of compromise. Reb Shmilqa,  for instance, is what I call Shmu'el Halpert.    [Yuval] Even Halpert is not a rabbi?    [Ravitz] No, no.    "I am a rabbi, of course," MK Halpert says of himself. He,  too, vigorously supports Menahem Hacohen's old bill. "In my  opinion, only someone who has been ordained as a rabbi by the  chief rabbinate is entitled to be called rabbi."    [Yuval] Menahem Hacohen thinks that only someone who will  actually work as a rabbi can carry the title.    [Halpert] Not just practicing rabbis. It is enough that they  have a rabbi's diploma. If someone passes his bar exams but does  not practice law, can he not be called a lawyer?    [Yuval] Did you serve as a rabbi?    [Halpert] For a very short time, very briefly.    [Yuval] Do you know which Knesset members are ordained  rabbis?    [Halpert] More or less.    [Yuval] Is Rafa'el Pinhasi a rabbi?    [Halpert] I do not know.    [Yuval] Is Menahem Porush a rabbi?    [Halpert] He has an ordination. Yes, absolutely.    According to Rabbi Halpert's information, MK Rafa'el Pinhasi  is not a rabbi, and neither is Menahem Porush, at least not in  the sense of having authority to decide questions of religious  law or, as he puts it, "I do not have the highest level of  certification, although what I know from my studies in the  seminary is far greater than that of other people who did not  study. And I will tell you something else. Some of the great  seminary heads, people who were giants of Torah, were not  qualified at the highest level. I do not want to mention names,  but when one of the giants of the generation wanted to pronounce  judgment at home on some matter, he would go to the city rabbi,  who was far below him in Torah learning.    [Yuval] Do you feel it is important whether someone bears  the  title of a qualified rabbi?    [Halpert] No, by no means.    'Eli'ezer Mizrahi also does not put much stock in  ordination.  "There are some people who have not received ordination but know  more even than rabbis. There are some people whom I call rabbi  because I know them, just as if they had rabbinic ordination.  You can learn a lot from them.    [Yuval] Are you qualified at the highest level?    [Mizrahi] I am on the way, as they say. If I had really  wanted to be a rabbi, I might have made the effort to enter an  institution where you have the time. But at this point, I think  I will continue my political life.    There are three points of convergence, de facto or de jure,  among all the rabbis interviewed. First, all of them answered as  a matter of course to the title "rabbi" attached to their names  and none of them corrected the speaker. The reason, apparently,  was the one given by MK Pinhasi: "In practice, we use the title  rabbi as a mark of honor and respect. The way secular Jews say  `the esteemed' or `sir,' haredi Jews follow the custom of saying  `rabbi.' That does not necessarily mean that he has received  rabbinic ordination." Second, most of them commented that, at  least at the start of their public careers, they did not feel at  ease being called rabbi, and that includes ordained rabbis like  Avraham Ravitz. "When I entered the Knesset, I thought, why  should I suddenly start this practice? Look, Efra'im Sneh, to  give an example, does not say that he is Dr. Sneh, but Dr. Yoram  Los does do that. Some people need to show off their title but I  did not feel that I had to do that."    More understandable is the uneasiness felt by honorary  rabbis  such as Rafa'el Pinhasi. "For me, it was very upsetting when I  entered the Knesset and they began calling me rabbi. I even went  and asked rabbis what to do about being given a title that I did  not deserve. The rabbis told me, `It is not your honor, it is  the public's; whoever leads it gets the title rabbi to  distinguish him from an ordinary man.'"    One other common point: None of those interviewed knew  whether MK Avraham Porush was an ordained rabbi. In fact, "MK  Shapira passed his exams and received rabbinic ordination,"  reports Arye Frankel, Shapira's media adviser. "Shapira did not  want to be called rabbi," he emphasized, "perhaps because he  also felt the subject is one of utter chaos, so that anyone who  wants a title can come and take it. Or it might be because he  comes from the business world, where a title is not important. I  doubt that he sits and fasts because people call him rabbi, but  he does not feel it is right."    This situation, in which everyone has taken a short cut to  make himself rabbi and there is no longer any need to work for  the honor, has annoyed and frustrated many people, none more so  than those in the national religious camp. In the absence of the  proper outfit, no one thought to call them rabbi. In fact, the  only ones in this camp to be honored with the title rabbi by the  media were thrust into their roles by virtue of their status as  rabbis, such as Rabbi Hayim Druckman.    The NRP [National Religious Party] was ready to forgo its  honor when some interviewer on the "Mabat" news program did not  use the title rabbi with MK Zevulun Hamer even though his  rabbinic training did not fall below that of MK Menahem Porush,  who was presented right after him as Rabbi Porush. But that  almost no secular reporter refers to MK Yitzhaq Levy by the  title that is rightfully his as a rabbi who runs an important  seminary, that was too much. It is no accident that most of the  wisecracks and bickering over the growing number of "rabbis"  come from the national religious camp. "He gave you a multitude  like weeds," they say about the phenomenon. [sentence as  published]    Curiously, the definition of who is a rabbi at some point  has  also concerned the secularists, who saw the title rabbi as a  sort of seal of moral standards. HA'OLAM HAZEH, fearlessly and  impartially, used to lock horns with Rabbi Me'ir Kahane over his  bona fides as a rabbi and even took pains to place the title in  quotation marks when it wrote about him. At the same time, MK  El'azar Granot of MAPAM [United Workers' Party] would point to  Kahane on the Knesset rostrum and taunt him, "You are no rabbi."    The racist Kahane, however, was an ordained rabbi from an  accredited institution, just as one-time prisoner Hayim Pardes,  who was convicted of indecent acts, is an ordained rabbi held in  high regard by his congregation. The years have made clear that  a rabbinic degree is no guarantee against sin. "Rabbis are  swindlers and rabbis are rapists and rabbis are thieves," Rabbi  Hacohen ironically describes the decline in the value of the  title. "Now there is no respect even for rabbis who are not  caught in such misconduct."    No one today is seriously considering a law that would ban  the indiscriminate use of the title rabbi. The secular media and  public no longer get excited over whether one public figure or  another is truly a rabbi, and the religious media and public  unerringly know who is a rabbi and who is not; if necessary, the  religious press helps its readers understand how people are to  be called. When everyone became a rabbi (aside from Rabbi  Goren), the religious press was compelled to be creative and  only genuine rabbis earned the expanded title "genius rabbi."  But inflation is a difficult process to stamp out, and within a  short time, every neighborhood rabbi became a genius rabbi. So  the [religious] press, seeking to maintain a hierarchy of  respect, introduced a new title: the rabbi genius. Then further  steps were added to the ladder, the "master genius," "our  teacher" and the greatest of all, "our teacher the genius," but  they all come back to the same place. Secular Jews will always  think that a bearded man wearing a black hat is a great rabbi of  the Torah, and the religious will forever distinguish between an  important rabbi, a more important rabbi, a plain old rabbi on  the newspaper page and Shlomo Goren.</p>

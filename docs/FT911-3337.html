			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / UK Company News: Ibex talks could lead to offer below market value IBEX, the USM-quoted recruitment and employment agency, said yesterday that it was in talks that might or might not lead to an offer being made at a price materially lower than the current market value. The announcement sent the shares plummetting 7p to 11p. At 18p, they were standing at their lowest point since the company joined the USM in April 1989, representing a steep decline in the company's market value since it floated at 175p per share. Ibex's market capitalisation at yesterday's closing level was Pounds 1.5m. Ibex and Hoare Govett, its financial adviser, said they could provide no further information on the situation. Last September, the company reported that it had just broken even in the six months to end-June, producing pre-tax profits of Pounds 7,000 against Pounds 1m in the corresponding period. That was after finance charges of Pounds 477,000 (Pounds 169,000). Earnings per share were nil (5.7p). Mr Hugh Laughland, chairman, then blamed the deterioration on a 'substantial reduction' in demand for the group's services. Turnover was up at Pounds 17.77m (Pounds 15.23m) owing to an increased number of branches. He also said the company had agreed to sell P&amp;M, its advertising business, for a nominal sum. The other main businesses are Austin Benn, a recruitment consultancy for sales and marketing staff and ABC Contract Services, which supplies temporary staff for the construction, warehousing and distribution industries.</p>

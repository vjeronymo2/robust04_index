			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / Branson may help rescue Dan-Air MR RICHARD Branson, founder of Virgin Atlantic Airways, may help to rescue Dan-Air, the UK-based airline which was saved from collapse less than a year ago. Davies &amp; Newman Holdings, owner of Dan-Air, has requested that its shares be suspended at 21p when the London stock market opens this morning, pending the outcome of the talks with Virgin. While ruling out a merger of the two airlines, both companies envisage Dan-Air aircraft flying under the Virgin name, with Mr Branson participating in a refinancing of Davies &amp; Newman by its institutional shareholders. The idea is that Dan-Air would benefit from Virgin's retail and marketing skills. The airlines would remain operationally separate, although both see benefits from co-ordinating Dan-Air's short-haul European network with Virgin's transatlantic services. Mr David James, chairman and company doctor to Davies &amp; Newman, denied weekend press reports that a deal with Virgin would mean redundancies among the 2,350 staff of his Gatwick-based airline, saying such a link-up would probably increase demand for staff. Although Dan-Air forecast pre-tax profits of Pounds 20m at the time of its Pounds 49.3m refinancing last October, the airline is now expected to incur a loss of Pounds 7m in 1992. When Mr Branson made specific proposals on Thursday evening, Mr James suspended his programme of meeting institutions, until the negotiations with Virgin are completed. Mr Branson, who owns a majority of the private Virgin Atlantic, will take a stake in Davies &amp; Newman only if institutional shareholders support the plan. Although Dan-Air's scheduled services have been doing well recently, the charter side has suffered from uncertainty about the future of the airline. Talks between Dan-Air and British Airways collapsed recently and Air France has also declined to get involved. However, BA may be concerned to see Dan-Air, which has six precious daily slots at Heathrow, link up with its arch-rival, Virgin. Mr James said he was hopeful that there would be a successful deal with Virgin within the next two weeks: 'The chemistry is so good that it would be to the benefit of British aviation.'</p>

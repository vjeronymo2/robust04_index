			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / Business-union accord close in South Africa SOUTH African business and labour leaders are near agreement on a 'charter for peace and economic reconstruction' which includes a call for elections for a transitional parliament within six months. If successful, the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu), would agree to call off a general strike scheduled to begin on August 3.

The South African Defence Force said yesterday it was 'investigating the background' of an SADF member who allegedly took part in a plot to kill Mr Dirk Coetzee, a former South African policeman living in London. Mr Coetzee says he was once in a police 'death squad'. The plot was prevented by British intelligence. Responding to reports in London's Independent newspaper, a spokesman said two SADF members went to London in April to look into alleged Irish Republican Army-ANC links. 'During the visit, one member, acting without the sanction or knowledge of the defence force, or any other government authority, allegedly decided to arrange for the monitoring of Mr Dirk Coetzee, the former fugitive South African police captain.'</p>

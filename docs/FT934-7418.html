			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / International Company News: Christiania plans share issues CHRISTIANIA BANK, the state controlled Norwegian bank, is to be pushed more fully into the private sector with share issues which will raise between NKr1.8bn and NKr2.2bn (Dollars 297m). The bank was taken over by the state two years ago following massive losses. It plans a private placement of 118m ordinary shares with institutional investors abroad and in Norway and a domestic public issue of 27m shares. The issues will go ahead in December. CBK is the second biggest bank in Norway. Private shareholders, which hold about 9 per cent of CBK's capital, will be entitled to shares sufficient to maintain their respective stakes, but will be given no pre-emptive rights. An NKr850m subordinated state loan is to be converted into 121m shares at NKr7 each, conditional on the success of the issues, thus reducing the state's stake to 69 per cent. The state has agreed that it will not dispose of any of its CBK shares until six months after the conversion. The issues will boost CBK's capital adequacy to 11.7 per cent from 8.6 per cent of risk-weighted assets. Core capital will be lifted to 5 per cent of total capital from 3 per cent.</p>

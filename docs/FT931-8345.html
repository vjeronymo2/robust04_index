			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / UK Company News: New man and cash call plan at Cupid THE FORTUNES of Cupid, the loss-making bridal wear company, are being revived by a new man at the top and by Pounds 1.9m of new money. The USM-quoted group yesterday announced Mr Richard Shaw's appointment as chairman and chief executive alongside a rights issue and share subscription. His aims include expanding Cupid into lingerie and possibly changing its name to help slough off a chequered reputation in the City. About Pounds 1.25m will be raised in the 4-for-9 issue, at 28p a share. Other new shares have been subscribed for by groups of individual investors, including the Shaw family with 4.2 per cent of the enlarged equity and a Guernsey couple called Cairns with 8.5 per cent. It was also reported that losses for the year to March 31 could total Pounds 1.5m, compared with a Pounds 867,000 pre-tax profit last year. Early last summer, before the last rights issue, pre-tax profit forecasts were in the Pounds 1.5m to Pounds 1.7m range. Cupid's share price, which fell to 35p last week when losses were predicted, had already started to recover on hopes of new investment and new management direction. It gained another 7p to 53p yesterday. Mr Shaw said post-interest losses were about Pounds 800,000. In the nursery division, two factories had been closed. The head office was also being sold and the operation transferred to the Blackburn factory. The exceptional costs of these moves, plus pay-offs to former and departing directors, accounted for the remaining Pounds 700,000 of expected losses. Mr Michael Murray, the founder, and his wife Sue, also a director, received Pounds 100,000 when they departed in December - alongside a profits warning. Mr Richard Lee, who has been chairman and chief executive in the interim, is also leaving.</p>

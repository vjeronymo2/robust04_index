			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> DOCTOR SAYS DYKES SHOULD BE OK FOR NEXT WEEK; PATRIOTS NOT SURE  </P> <P> New England Patriots wide receiver Hart Lee Dykes, who suffered an eye injury  in a brawl outside a nightclub, should be ready to play in the Patriots' next  game, his doctor said today.  </P> <P> The team was more cautious, saying it was too early to discuss Dykes' status.  </P> <P> He was expected to be released from the hospital today.  </P> <P> "He is dramatically better than he was yesterday," ophthalmologist Robert Bahr  said after examining Dykes at Rhode Island Hospital. "He's feeling better and  he's seeing better."  </P> <P> Dykes and teammate Irving Fryar were injured early Wednesday in an altercation  outside Club Shalimar. Fryar, who pulled a handgun to stop the assault, said  people were beating and kicking Dykes.  </P> <P> Dykes' eye was swollen and he was kept overnight at the hospital for  observation, Bahr said.  </P> <P> "He's going to probably have to take it easy for a while," Bahr said, adding he  expected Dykes to be able to play Oct. 18 against Miami. The Patriots have a  bye this week.  </P></p>

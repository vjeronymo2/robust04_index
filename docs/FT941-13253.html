Mr Zhu, secretary-general of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, said the commission was considering opening domestic bourses to overseas investors and allowing Chinese citizens to hold 'foreigners-only' B shares. Allowing overseas firms to list domestic A shares is also being considered, but no decisions have been made, he said.</p>

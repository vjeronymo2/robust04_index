			<p>BFN     [Text] Flor del Monte (Colombia), 9 Apr (EFE) -- The  Socialist Renewal Movement (CRS) today became the fifth  Colombian guerrilla organization to reach a peace agreement with  the government within the past four years.    Government representatives and leaders of the CRS -- a  dissident group once under the Marxist Army of National  Liberation (ELN) -- today signed an agreement incorporating  about 850 members of this organization -- 430 of whom were  bearing weapons -- into national political and institutional  life. The agreement was signed in Flor del Monte (northern  Colombia).    On 9 March 1990, the 19th April Movement became the first  group to lay down its weapons. It was followed by the Popular  Liberation Army (EPL) in March 1991, the People's Revolutionary  Party (PRT) in April 1991, and the Quintin Lame Indians Movement  in May 1991.    The weapons surrender ceremony in Flor del Monte (Sucre) was  attended by a dozen ambassadors, politicians from all parties,  delegations from domestic and international organizations, and  Catholic Church representatives -- all of whom attended as  observers.    The activities marking this event began on 8 April with the  collection and inventory of weapons and ammunition under the  supervision of an international oversight group established to  monitor compliance with the agreements. The Dutch Government  and Socialist International are members of this oversight group.    The weapons will be smelted and turned into bells for  churches located in the pacified zone. Meanwhile, the  ammunition was spent when the rebels fired all of their weapons  into the air. In all, some 450 weapons were emptied, including  rifles, submachine guns, revolvers, and pistols of various  calibers. The last remaining weapons, which are in the hands of  some 50 men, will be surrendered in two parts -- today during  the main ceremony and, later, when the combatants start to  abandon their camp.    After the ceremonies, which included cultural activities and  a symbolic farewell to arms, the Flor del Monte camp will be  dismantled and the former combatants will immediately depart for  different regions to establish political headquarters and work  places.    The Arco Iris Foundation, which was established by the  guerrillas, will coordinate the integration process. It will be  in charge of channeling funds to various programs, including  programs aimed at promoting small businesses and farms.    The CRS also will be entitled to two seats in the Chamber of  Representatives.    Some 430 members of this group are in the camp, and there  are  another 221 in various prisons. There are also about 200 people  who have been giving the CRS political and logistical support.  Most of these people have been investigated for subversion.  Now, they also will enjoy legal benefits.    The negotiations included eight areas: human rights, civic  participation, economic consensus, regional development,  economic and social integration, political benefits, legal  benefits, and the surrender of weapons.    The CRS emerged five years ago following a split within the  ELN. The ELN is a Marxist guerrilla group led by former Spanish  priest Manuel Perez. Some commanders had criticized the  philosophy, methods, and procedures used by the group's central  leadership. Based on these major differences, a dissident group  known initially as "The Patch" [El Parche] emerged.    The ELN dissidents mainly disagreed with making the struggle  more military than political and focusing it on the countryside  and not in urban centers. They also disapproved of the strategy  of using terrorism and kidnapping to promote the war against the  state.    Following the CRS demobilization, there are still some  10,000  active guerrillas, mostly under the Communist Revolutionary  Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), the ELN, and a dissident group  of the EPL.</p>

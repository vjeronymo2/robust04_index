			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / How to Spend It: Office gossip, how the power brokers work and play - Santa Raymond, a practising architect and interior designer, looks at the offices that three movers and shakers have created / Lynne Franks LYNNE FRANKS, doyenne of the public relations world, believes that colour is important. She explains that the purple of the paint work and sofa in her office is the colour of spiritual receiving, and that the pale green of the walls provides energy. The frieze of white convolvulus, after Georgia O'Keefe, which runs from side to side of the office was suggested by 'dowsing' to balance energy levels. Franks aims for a relaxed and comfortable place where clients will unwind, colleagues feel able to express their anxieties, and her charitable interests may be discussed profitably. She talks of the atmosphere of her office conveying the 'balanced woman, with career and family life in equilibrium'; of it being a place in which to 'be centred, and feel good in.' It is a high room, top-lit and without windows. It could be a daunting space. However, with designer Ben Kelly she has made an environment which is stimulating, friendly and relaxing. She has no formal desk but uses a glass-topped table on an antique stand pushed into the corner. She talks with people sitting on one of two sofas: the day I visited there was a terracotta vase of catkins on the coffee table. A glass screen by Danny Lane stands behind, and the walls are covered with family photographs. Personal and professional mementos are displayed on a wooden shelf running beneath the frieze. It is very much a living-office, without a computer terminal or paper storage and with just a refrigerator sitting against the wall. I asked Franks whether the lighting, from translucent orbs hanging from the ceiling, provided the right atmosphere at night. She said she was not there then, so it did not matter. She uses the boardroom for formal meetings, sitting on an orange, scarlet or fuchsia Arne Jacobsen chair at a glass-topped table by Tom Dixon, asymmetrical on a miniature space frame. Everywhere Kelly has used colour and materials in exciting ways, converting this garage in London's Harrow Road into a corporate office which impresses such clients as Coca-Cola, Lloyds Bank or the pop singer Annie Lennox. The door to Lynne Franks's office is never closed, and for much of the time she is out on the floor with her account executives.</p>

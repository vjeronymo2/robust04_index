			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Mates brought in by Nadir PR adviser MR MICHAEL Mates first took an interest in Mr Asil Nadir, the fugitive businessman, after an approach by Mr Mark Rogerson, one of Mr Nadir's public relations advisers. In a statement issued on Monday Mr Mates, the minister who is at the centre of a political row over his relationship with the founder of the Polly Peck business empire, said he had been approached to take an interest in Mr Nadir's affairs by a 'a constituent who was one of Mr Nadir's advisers'. It emerged yesterday that the constituent was Mr Rogerson, a former BBC journalist and founder of Morgan &amp; Rogerson, a public relations firm which advises Mr Nadir. Mr Nadir last month jumped his Pounds 3.5m bail and fled to northern Cyprus. Mr Rogerson said yesterday that he had approached Mr Mates, a minister in the Northern Ireland office, because he had understood that Mr Mates was a 'good MP'. Mr Rogerson and his partner, Mr Christopher Morgan, are convinced that Mr Nadir has received unjust treatment from the British legal system since he was charged in December 1990 with theft and false accounting. Mr Morgan has known Mr Mates for several years. Mr Rogerson said yesterday that he had never met Mr Mates before talking to him about Mr Nadir. The first meeting between Mr Mates and Mr Rogerson took place 18 months ago and there have been several subsequent meetings. Mr Mates has also discussed the Serious Fraud Office's handling of Mr Nadir's case with Mr Anthony Scrivener QC, Mr Nadir's defence counsel. Mr Scrivener said yesterday that he could not recall any reference to an introduction by a constituent when Mr Mates approached him. In his statement on Monday Mr Mates said that 'a constituent who was one of Nadir's advisers' contacted him about 18 months ago 'raising certain matters' about the SFO's handling of the case and the delay in bringing it to court. Mr Mates has said that he subsequently had meetings with the attorney-general and there had been 'an exchange of correspondence' on the subject, throughout which he had been 'consulted and advised ' by Mr Scrivener. Mr Scrivener said he could not recall the first time he had been approached by Mr Mates other than it was 'possibly' before the last election. He said: 'Mr Mates was very heated (about the SFO treatment) . . . I don't know about a constituent . . . Mr Mates appeared out of the blue.' Mr Scrivener defended Mr Mates's action, which he described as the 'absolutely correct action' by an MP on the side of justice. Mr Mates received the support of a colleague in the Northern Ireland office yesterday when Mr Robert Atkins, a junior minister, said that the matter was not one that required Mr Mates's resignation, and that he was sure his colleague would come through the affair 'with flying colours'. Some other Conservative MPs were less supportive, however, and said that the connection with Mr Nadir put a question mark over Mr Mates's judgment. The minister's statement, in which he said he had acted on behalf of a constituent and that he had given a watch to Mr Nadir as a light-hearted gift, has so far failed to silence his critics. Labour MPs have already said that they intend to increase the pressure on Mr John Major to investigate Mr Mates's actions in connection with Mr Nadir when the Commons returns next week.</p>

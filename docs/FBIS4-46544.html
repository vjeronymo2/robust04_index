			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Excerpt from presentation of Minister of Defense of Ukraine </F> General of the Army of Ukraine Vitaliy Radetskyy at a  practical-science conference: "Military Discipline--A Very  Important Component of Combat Readiness"]    [Text] The Armed Forces, along with the chief task of  ensuring the protection of the independence and territorial  integrity of Ukraine, face the task of taking into account, in  military development under contemporary conditions, the dynamic  of changes in geopolitical circumstances and the accomplishment  of a great deal of work that would make it possible to ensure in  quality fashion the national security of Ukraine.    One of the chief places among the multifaceted areas of that  activity belongs to the strengthening of military discipline.  Military discipline is one type of state discipline, and has  particular significance for the Armed Forces. It performs a role  of an organizational nature, and instills orders in and protects  the system of relations within the setting of the military  collectives. Military discipline is undoubtedly one of the most  important constituent elements of the combat readiness of the  troops and the functioning of the Armed Forces as a whole. We  are in extreme need today of a state of affairs under which  every serviceman would knowingly fulfill the laws and norms of  morality. Numerous instances, however, testify that we are still  far away from that.    A considerable number of legal offenses were committed over  the first quarter of this year in the ranks. And even though the  increase is insignificant compared to the same statistical  period for 1993, it must be admitted that a serious situation  has taken shape in the Army. The state of military discipline as  a whole is eliciting considerable concern in the Air Forces, the  troops of the Odessa Military District and the ground forces.  The supply of housing and the health of people remain acute  problems among the troops.    The prevention of absence without leave from units by  conscript servicemen and searching for them is not being  resolved in satisfactory fashion.    The moral-psychological climate in many military subunits is  not improving, and there are instances of non-regulation  relations and barracks hooliganism; the overall number of  instances of non-regulation relations in the Armed Forces of  Ukraine this year has increased compared to the analogous period  of last year.    The number of crimes connected with the theft of state  property is increasing. One out of nine crimes is the theft of  material assets of military units, organizations and  institutions.    Why, while constantly and daily occupied with questions of  strengthening military discipline, are we forced to admit that  there is a drop in the overall level of organization and order  and a rise in the crime rate?    The unfavorable influence of the social climate that is  taking shape surrounding the Armed Forces is being felt first of  all. The increased difficulty of the socio-economic situation in  Ukraine, the negative processes that are taking place in society  and being recreated in the Armed Forces, are leading to an  increase in psychological tensions, apathy, confusion and  uncertainty for the future in the officer corps, and are  affecting the socio-psychological phenomena that constitute the  foundation of its moral-psychological state.    Military sociological polling on problems of the social  sentiments of servicemen in the Armed Forces of Ukraine has  shown, at the same time, that the officer corps of the Armed  Forces of Ukraine, despite all of the difficulties and problems  of everyday life, still has a certain reserve of professional  energy that permits the state and military leadership to count  on the maintenance of the necessary level of combat and  mobilization readiness in the units and subunits of the Armed  Forces. This is testified to by the fact that close to 49  percent of the officers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine have a  positive attitude toward their social status today, and are  striving for the realization of creative initiative, the  discovery of intellectual and physical capabilities and  characteristics of will in their service activity. These values  occupy the second and third places respectively after the  aspiration for material security, which is natural under our  conditions.    Second, the higher leadership of the Armed Forces still has  a  reserve of trust among the overwhelming majority of the officer  corps. This is the opinion of 72 percent of the servicemen who  were polled for their assessment of the reasons for the problems  and troubles in the Armed Forces. This credit of trust should be  utilized by us as a means of consolidating and rallying the  personnel in the contemporary stage of development of the Armed  Forces of Ukraine.    At the same time, if we do not make use of the patriotic  potential of the officer corps, the consequences could be  disastrous for the Armed Forces. The results of research also  testify to this.    We military people, however, in speaking of the immediate  and  organic dependence of military organization on the state of  affairs in society as a whole, do not have the right to be  troubled by it ourselves. One also cannot help but see the fact  that our methods of activity are not in harmony with the actual  circumstances and extraordinary conditions which the Armed  Forces and state are in. There are many who approach the  problems of today with the measures of yesterday, who do not see  the disparity of the decisions that are being made with the way  the Armed Forces are living and what people expect of them. That  is happening in the central apparatus of the Ministry of Defense  as well.    We have also not been able to make a qualitative  breakthrough  in stabilizing military discipline because certain methods of  work that had positive results under the conditions of the Armed  Forces of the former Soviet Union have not yet played themselves  out today, but have rather become a distinctive kind of brake. A  number of generals and officers have had great difficulty  getting rid of the approaches of yesterday in the indoctrination  of the personnel and the strengthening of discipline. "Force"  forms and "command pedagogy" frequently have the opposite  effect. The human factor is being taken into account in word but  not in deed.    The generals and officers of the central apparatus of the  Ministry of Defense, on questions of strengthening military  discipline, must in the spirit of personal responsibility:    --improve the style and methods of management activity, and  raise their personal executive discipline and responsibility for  the ultimate results of the training of the troops;    --fundamentally rebuild the process of working through and  making decisions on questions of military discipline;    --promptly review issues raised by the troops, be an example  of energetic action to eliminate shortcomings and to strengthen  organization and law and order, and raise comprehensively the  effectiveness of organizational, executive and legal assurance  of the fulfillment of the requirements of the Temporary  Regulations of the Armed Forces;    --forego inspectional activity and move to  organizational-creative activity among the troops on the basis  of professionalism, a critical attitude toward each step, and  checking of oneself through practical results. This is also  important because a significant change in cadres has occurred  over the last two years in the  regiment--brigade--division--corps--district echelons. The  overwhelming majority of senior officers and commanders do not  have sufficient practical experience. Shouting, abuse and image  cannot train them to lead their subordinate units and formations  in competent fashion. This signifies that we must not only learn  ourselves, but also teach our subordinates and provide practical  assistance in the field;    --display constant concern for the professional growth of  cadres in subordinate military structures, and provide practical  assistance without excessive administration in the formation of  a healthy moral atmosphere among the military collectives; and    --be highly demanding of those who have a disdainful  attitude  toward the needs and aspirations of the troops, or who make  formalistic assessments of the state of affairs in subordinate  units.    Our prestige as military leaders and our successes in the  key  areas of the organizational development of the Armed Forces as a  whole will depend to a significant extent on this.    Third. We must look in a new way at the problems of the  moral-psychological state of all categories of servicemen under  the conditions of the destabilization of the situation in the  state and the changes that are occurring in the vital activity  of the Armed Forces, as is required by the Military Doctrine of  Ukraine. There can be no strong military discipline, no official  activity in the mastery of military hardware and weaponry, no  reliable maintenance of the guaranteed level of combat readiness  and battleworthiness without these components.    The Main Directorate for Indoctrination Work must take more  decisive steps in the direction of the systematic development  and formulation of a healthy moral-psychological state among the  personnel along with the principal criteria for evaluating it,  both in peacetime and in special times. Serious and practical  work is needed. A unification of the efforts of all the  directorates of the central apparatus of the Ministry of Defense  is expected for the accomplishment of that task.    The moral-psychological training of personnel is a  constituent element of combat readiness. The commanders and  superior officers supervising combat training, however, also  have an effect on spiritual processes in the military  environment.    Very serious work still lies ahead for us in order to see  that the moral-psychological factor is activated. It would be  expedient, in my opinion, to begin promptly the development of a  system for the study, analysis and resolution of problems of the  moral-psychological state of the troops. I feel that the  question of more profound and scientific study of the problem of  the moral-psychological state could be the subject of discussion  at one of the practical-science conferences of the central  apparatus of the Ministry of Defense in 1995, after the  completion of the first stage of the organizational development  of the Armed Forces. This does not signify, however, that this  question will only be raised a year from now. The results of  work on these problems should be passed along to the military  administrative elements at all levels to the extent of the  receipt of those results, and they should pass through the prism  of military practice during training, maneuvers and exercises.    Fourth. The skill of the military personnel to conduct  purposeful indoctrination work gains great value in  strengthening military discipline under the conditions of the  democratization of army life. Practice today demands that we  think about the creation of an indoctrination mechanism for  strengthening military discipline. We are unfortunately not able  to do this to the full extent today, because we do not yet have  a scientifically substantiated system of views on the  indoctrination of the personnel of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.  And that is not just a pretty theoretical reference. Life itself  dictates the development of a national theory of the  indoctrination process in the Armed Forces. The difficult  socio-economic and political situation in Ukraine and around it,  around the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the sometime impossibility  of foreseeing the development of this situation, the ideological  fragmentation and uncertainty in the consciousness of people,  the wholesale denigration of all and everything, including the  best traditions of the Armed Forces of the former USSR, whence  we all came, and the denigration of the young Ukrainian Army are  all undermining the morale of the troops and causing a real  necessity of urgent measures of a political, economic,  organizational, educational and moral-psychological nature to  strengthen the moral-psychological climate for servicemen in the  Armed Forces of Ukraine. The national theory of the  indoctrination of the personnel, in my opinion, should reflect  all aspects of the indoctrination work with the troops, from the  basic aims and concepts and the system of views to the  preparation and distribution of cadres of logistical and  financial support for the indoctrination process. A prominent  place in it should belong to the substance, forms and methods of  military indoctrination and the educational mechanism for  strengthening military discipline.    This should signify, first of all, a thorough knowledge of  circumstances at all levels of the army organism, their constant  analysis, the clear-cut distribution of duties of all officials  on which the improvement of military discipline depends for the  officers and generals of the directorates of the central  apparatus of the Ministry of Defense--when what and how each of  them should be doing what. The speeches of the generals and  officers of the central apparatus of the Ministry of Defense to  the personnel on topical problems in military organizational  development must be put into practice.    The preparations for the fiftieth anniversary of Victory in  the Great Patriotic War are opening up broad possibilities for  expanding the work to indoctrinate the personnel in the combat  traditions of the people who, in unified combat ranks with the  peoples of the former USSR and the anti-Hitlerite coalition,  made a substantial contribution to the rout of German fascism  and Japanese militarism. The martial glories of the warriors of  Ukraine should be turned into a continuously running generator  for the formation of civil consciousness and patriotism.    The system of humanities training for the personnel should  be  an important factor in the indoctrination process. Much is being  done in this area, but there are many shortcomings as well.  Significant corrections in both the substance and the forms of  the work are required. One cannot circumvent, in speaking of the  indoctrination of discipline, the problems of the  individualization of that process based on the utilization of  the achievements of general and military psychology and  sociology. Much cadre, theoretical and practical work lies ahead  in this area. I feel, in the area of content, that a system of  socio-psychological support for military discipline that would  be composed of four basic elements should be created in the  Armed Forces.    First is a unified system of military professional  and psychological selection.    Second is socio-psychological support for  military-professional activity.    Third is the psychological training of all  categories of personnel in official positions.    Fourth is intensified special and dedicated  moral-psychological training, depending on the specific nature  of the professional activity.    The creation of a system of indoctrinational work in the  Armed Forces and an indoctrinational mechanism for the  strengthening of military discipline is one of our chief tasks.  This requires high competence and initiative, great inner  organization and personal discipline from every officer and  general in the central apparatus of the Ministry of Defense. A  very great deal already depends on us today if we want to be the  Ministry of Defense of a great European power--Ukraine.    Fifth, it is important to impart a steadfast social-legal  orientation to the process of strengthening military discipline.  The priority areas of the military policy of the leadership of  Ukraine and the activity of the Ministry of Defense should thus  be constant attention toward the problems of social protections  for servicemen.    There is an urgent need for the rapid development of  measures  to ensure the stabilization of the social situation of officer  personnel, and especially certain socio-demographic and  professional categories.    The Supreme Commander-in-Chief and the Military Collegium of  the Ministry of Defense, notwithstanding the difficult economic  conditions, are devoting constant attention to the problems of  social security for servicemen. The discussion concerns, first  and foremost, carrying out compensatory measures under  conditions of inflation and permanent price rises, and the  resolution of the housing problem. On the agenda is the  development of drafts of such legislation in the sphere of  social protections for servicemen. It is very important here to  learn to accumulate both our own and overseas experience.    We must think seriously about the development of a  comprehensive, dedicated program for the social development of  the Armed Forces. The essence of them, in my view, should  consist of a scientifically substantiated definition of the  aims, tasks, indications and measures, the establishment of the  deadlines, rates and proportions of the development of the  military-professional spiritual and social spheres from the  military unit or ship up to the Armed Forces as a whole, and in  the long run, the full-scale integration of the social sphere of  the Army into the social sphere of all of society. The generals  and officers of the central apparatus of the Ministry of Defense  of Ukraine should structure their organizational and  indoctrination work among the troops exclusively on the basis of  the laws of Ukraine, the edicts and directives of the President  of Ukraine as the Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Armed  Forces, and statutes and orders. A situation must be sought in  which the law is respected to an identical extent and is upheld  by both superior officers and subordinates. The organization of  a regulation way of life and the introduction of monitoring of  the upholding of law and order should be a prominent direction  of our work.    The Minister of Defense of Ukraine, referring to the  participants in the conference, emphasized that "We will never  raise discipline if we do not work on prevention. But  military-social activity is not a static, fixed structure from a  dynamic point of view; it is a unity of processes and phenomena  that change and develop. We should thus be concerned with the  introduction of scientific approaches to studying the reasons  for offenses, predicting the possible development of processes  in discipline and devising paramount and long-term preventive  measures. In the sphere of social-legal work to strengthen  military discipline, we must single out more clearly the  principal chains that are linked with the contemporary  turnaround stage in the emergence of the Ukrainian state and  military organizational development. The main thing here, in my  opinion (and this is very important today), is to advance not by  means of an escalation of the arrogant conclusions of verbal  courage, but rather by means of penetration to the very depths  of social-legal problems on the basis of accumulated experience,  a scientific approach and their guaranteed resolution in the  interests of the person in uniform."    Sixth, the successful strengthening of military discipline  is  possible only with a well-versed knowledge of its real  situation. Objective, timely and complete information on  violations of regulation order, incidents and crimes has great  significance in this regard. This information should be present  at all levels of military administration, from the subunit to  the Ministry of Defense. The organizational measures of  commanders and staffs of the bodies for indoctrination work at  all levels should occupy an even more important place in this  matter.    The institution of regulation order, increased exactingness  toward subordinates, improvement of the system of monitoring and  the application of disciplinary practice should all be of an  effective, educational nature. I feel that it is essential that  the officers of the central apparatus of the Ministry of Defense  analyze diligently the fulfillment of the requirements of  orders, directives and instructions pertaining to the  strengthening of military discipline, make an assessment of the  organization of that activity by commanders, staffs and bodies  for indoctrination work, and provide practical assistance on  this issue during the end-of-training-period performance  evaluations in the ranks.</p>

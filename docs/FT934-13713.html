			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / International Company News: Western Areas result boosts JCI earnings A STRONG performance from the Western Areas mine helped lift profit after tax and capital expenditure from the three gold mines in the Johannesburg Consolidated Investment (JCI) group by 23.3 per cent to R72.5m (Dollars 21.7m) in the September quarter from R58.8m in the same period last year. Western Areas increased net profit by 70 per cent to R37.7m from R22.2m. Gold production rose for the fifth consecutive quarter, by 7.4 per cent to 4,104kg from 3,823kg, as both tonnes milled and grade increased. The average gold price received rose by 7.6 per cent to R38,091 a kg from R35,403 a kg. Unit working costs declined by 1.1 per cent to R29,511 a kg. Randfontein produced 8,121kg of gold, up from 7,902kg, lifting net profits by 8.3 per cent to R37.2m from R34.4m after capital expenditure of R20m. The Joel mine recorded a loss of R2.5m compared with a R2.2m profit the previous quarter. The strategy of maintaining a reduced stoping rate while increasing development to build up a sound payable ore reserve is being continued. Lower volumes in the inland market and weaker prices contributed to a 35 per cent decline in attributable profit to R112.4m at Randcoal, one of South Africa's three main coal producers, in the year to September. Earnings per share fell by 48 per cent to 87 cents following the issue of shares. The dividend was cut by 25 per cent to 45 cents.</p>

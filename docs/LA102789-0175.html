			<p><P> October 27, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> RETURN OF MARCOS' BODY REJECTED;  </P> <P> SPLIT PHILIPPINES SUPREME COURT REJECTS RETURN OF MARCOS' BODY  </P> <P> The Supreme Court of the Philippines today narrowly rejected a petition to let  the family of Ferdinand E. Marcos bring his body home for burial, ruling 8-7  that the ousted president is still a threat to national security.  </P> <P> President Corazon Aquino, who was swept to power in a 1986 popular revolt that  ended Marcos' 20-year rule, immediately welcomed the court's decision and  called for unity.  </P> <P> But 5,000 Marcos supporters marching from his hometown in the north of the  country to Manila to pressure Aquino to reverse her ban issued a manifesto  calling her heartless and attacking corruption and the government's failure to  stem the country's Communist insurgency.  </P> <P> Marcos, who died in exile in Hawaii on Sept. 28, has been interred temporarily  in Honolulu. But supporters had petitioned the court to allow his family to  bury him in the Philippines.  </P> <P> Noting the court's split decision, Aquino's estranged Vice President Salvador  Laurel said it was unfortunate that even the Supreme Court was divided on the  issue of Marcos' return.  </P></p>

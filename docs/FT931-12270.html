			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / S Africa inflation at 15-year low SOUTH AFRICA'S inflation rate has dropped into single figures for the first time in nearly 15 years, reviving hopes of a turnround in the economy, writes Philip Gawith in Johannesburg. Figures released by the Central Statistical Service (CSS) show that the rate of inflation, measured by the consumer price index, declined to 9.6 per cent in December from 11 per cent in November. This is the lowest rate of inflation since June 1978. The CPI declined by five percentage points in the second half of 1992, having stood at 16.2 at the end of 1991. Economists have long been predicting a further drop in interest rates, and the most recent inflation figures have bolstered their case. Dr Chris Stals, governor of the Reserve Bank, said yesterday that the bank was re-examining its monetary policy - often a signal for a cut in rates. The prime lending rate currently stands at 17.25 per cent. Mr Dave Mohr, chief economist at the Old Mutual group, said the decline in the inflation rate, which was sharper than predicted, was partly a function of large increases in the CPI in the second half of 1991, and partly the result of very small increases in the corresponding period in 1992. He cited lower meat and vegetable prices, and falling mortgage rates as important contributory factors. Other factors include a fairly strong exchange rate, and firm monetary policy with real interest rates now running at about 7.5 per cent. Mr Mohr said inflation, which is a lagging indicator, reflected the weak state of the economy for most of 1992.</p>

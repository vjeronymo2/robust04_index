			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (35): UK is still seen as best value - The managers must judge whether the equities rally will last The Professionals THIS IS not a competition, but an allocation exercise, the purpose of which is to see how five professional fund managers manage a Pounds 250,000 portfolio on behalf of a client of their choice. In each case, the client is either a wealthy individual or a small, self-administered pension fund. All the fund managers stress that they are investing for the long term - 10 years and more  - rather than short-term gain. The exercise started at the beginning of October last year. The portfolios given here were struck as at the end of March, and will be reviewed again at the end of June. CASH IS supposed to be king in times of recession and uncertainty. Yet to have been invested in cash during the past quarter would have meant missing out on a dramatic rally in world share prices. In the three months since the five last reassessed their portfolios, the UK market has risen by 16.5 per cent; continental European markets have risen by an average of 13.8 per cent; the US market has climbed by 26.9 per cent (in sterling terms) and Japanese equities by 20.5 per cent (again in sterling). To varying degrees, all five correctly anticipated this upsurge in share prices, chosing to buy equities at a time when the Gulf war had yet to break out and the world economic and political outlook was very uncertain. Now the war is long over, but economic uncertainties remain. The professional investors now have to decide whether the rally in share prices has been overdone, particularly in the US, where small-company shares rose by 42 per cent over the quarter, without any incontrovertible evidence that the country is out of recession. Here is how the fund managers assess the outlook for the next quarter. Douglas McDougall, at Baillie Gifford, is not altering his holding of UK shares, in the belief that inflation and interest rates will fall further during the year, setting the scene for economic recovery. 'Profits and dividends should not suffer too badly in the recession, and the equity market is still reasonably valued despite his rise,' he says. He is selling his US stake - 12.5 per cent of the portfolio  - because the market is, in his view, expensive and the prospects for economic recovery doubtful. The holding in continental European equities is increased from 20 to 25 per cent, and he takes a new 5 per cent holding in Japanese equities. He is also increasing his South-east Asia stake from 12.5 to 15 per cent and his holdings of cash and Japanese bonds (accounting for 15 per cent of the total) are switched into long French government bonds, where yields of 9.2 per cent are to him 'attractive against recent and imminent inflation, and could fall substantially'. Paul Myners, at Gartmore, is tinkering with the composition of his holding of UK equities, which remains at 55 per cent of the portfolio. He wants to increase his weighting in small-company shares and, as a result, a fifth of the total portfolio is to be invested in small-company investment trusts. Five per cent is to be invested in the capital shares of split-level investment trusts. He reflects that he was wrong to have invested 7.5 per cent of the portfolio in Deutsche Mark bonds, which rose by 2.4 per cent over the quarter. They are being sold, and the proceeds used to take the stake in Pacific Rim equities from 7.5 to 12.5 per cent of the portfolio, and to take a new 2.5 per cent holding in Japanese equity warrants. Otherwise, the portfolio is unchanged. Simon Toynbee, at Mercury Asset Management, candidly admits that markets rose more quickly during the first quarter than he anticipated. 'Our cautious stance three months ago (with 20 per cent cash), with hindsight, was not vindicated but was very appropriate at the time,' he reflects. 'After such a very sharp rise in all world stock markets, some degree of consolidation is expected over the next three months,' he says. 'The value of UK equities is still modest, and on a longer term view we remain optimistic. We are concerned about the high valuation of US equities and the weakness of the Deutsche Mark which is unsettling the German stock market.' The aim over the next quarter is to take the UK weighting from 40 to 50 per cent of the portfolio. Accordingly, the holding of UK gilts is being cut back from 15 to 5 per cent after a quarter in which gilts rose by 7.7 per cent. Cash is being reduced from 20 to 17 per cent, the 3 per cent being invested in Far East equities. Otherwise the holdings remain the same. Within the UK market, Mr Toynbee is looking to increase the portfolio's exposure to those cyclical stocks that are sensitive to economic upturn: he highlights the quality engineering companies, and GKN in particular. He notes that sentiment towards smaller-company shares is improving, but says it is important to buy companies with strong management and strong balance sheets. Howard Beaufort, at Newton Investment Management, is still cautious. 'There is no point in rushing into anything just because the markets are going up,' he says. 'That is a recipe for disaster. I'm aiming to produce a real rate of return and not to be a slave to the markets. Whatever the markets do now I wouldn't have a single worry about the stocks I have here.' His cash holding, 33 per cent at the beginning of the year, is now down to 8 per cent, and bonds are down from 25 to 12 per cent. The cash released has been invested in equities, which now account for 80 per cent of the portfolio, against 42 per cent three months ago. UK stocks - which account for 40 per cent of the total  - include Abbey National, British Gas, BTR, Fisons, Northern Foods, RTZ, Severn Trent, Shell, Unilever and Whitbread. In the US, he has just two holdings: Failure Group and General Electric. In other markets, he holds shares in: Ito Yokado, Schering, Alcatel Alsthom, Stet, Banco Popular, Roche and Nestle. David Poole, at Singer &amp; Friedlander, had the gutsiest stance back in October when this exercise began. While the other investors had large cash holdings, Mr Poole confidently put 80 per cent of the total into equities, a stance subsequently vindicated by events. There are no major adjustments to his portfolio: his holding of UK equities goes up by 3 per cent to 63 per cent; continental European and US equities are cut back slightly, as are European bonds and sterling cash; the exposure to Japan and the Far East is adjusted marginally upwards. In the UK market, Mr Poole has started to switch from defensive Footsie businesses into quality growth stocks, including well-managed second-line stocks which have underperformed, particularly those with a bias to US earnings, such as Dawson International and Coats Viyella. He has also bought a number of high-yielding convertible stocks, where dividend growth rate is expected to exceed that of the ordinary share. Note that all the fund managers are considerably more optimistic than they were six months ago when this exercise began. They believe that a period of consolidation is ahead; and that the best value is still to be found in the UK market.</p>

			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWS ANALYSIS;  </P> <P> SIDES DECIDE TO SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE;  </P> <P> ARMS CONTROL: TWO SUPERPOWERS ADOPT A SPIRIT OF COMPROMISE TO BREAK IMPASSES  AND ENSURE A SUCCESSFUL SUMMIT.  </P> <P> It took an extra day of sometimes rancorous negotiations, but the United States  and the Soviet Union have broken the back of a vexing disagreement that could  have dimmed the summit meeting between President Bush and Soviet President  Mikhail S. Gorbachev beginning May 30.  </P> <P> The compromises on seemingly abstract range and counting rules for cruise  missiles provide the basis for an arms control agreement that will permit Bush  and Gorbachev to claim success for their Washington meeting. With anything  less, the summit probably would be counted a failure.  </P> <P> Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.  Shevardnadze said that a few details remain to be worked out. But both men  predicted that the remaining issues could be settled before Gorbachev arrives  in Washington.  </P> <P> According to senior U.S. officials, the deal was struck Friday during a  five-hour meeting between Baker and Gorbachev. But the agreement almost fell  apart a few hours later when Soviet military leaders tried to impose new  conditions and pull back from concessions Gorbachev had accepted.  </P> <P> In the end, the senior official said, the Soviet side agreed to return to the  Baker-Gorbachev understanding.  </P> <P> On most matters, the two sides simply split the difference between the official  positions.  </P> <P> But Gorbachev accepted the U.S. demand that the only limitation on sea-launched  cruise missiles would be "politically binding" statements of intent by both  sides, without any requirement for verification.  </P> <P> Washington opposes verification of limits on sea-launched cruise missiles  because nuclear missiles -- which would be covered by a strategic arms treaty  -- cannot be distinguished from conventionally armed missiles, which would not.  </P> <P> The Soviet side agreed to such an unverified statement last February but then  pulled back. In effect, the Soviets have returned to their earlier concession.  </P> <P> In exchange, the United States agreed to a limit of 880 on sea-launched cruise  missiles. Washington had hoped to avoid any numerical ceiling, but the 880  figure is at least 100 higher than the number the Pentagon plans to buy.  </P> <P> The United States also agreed to exclude sea-launched cruise missiles with  ranges of less than 375 miles. Washington had wanted to include weapons with  ranges of more than 185 miles. Officials explained that the Soviet Union has a  number of aging missile systems with ranges between 185 and 375 miles. Under  the compromise, these will not be restricted.  </P> <P> On air-launched cruise missiles, the United States agreed to a Soviet demand  that all missiles with a range of more than 375 miles be counted by the treaty  after the Soviet side agreed that a new American missile known as Tacit Rainbow  would not be included.  </P> <P> The Tacit Rainbow project is intended to be armed with non-nuclear warheads,  which normally would mean it would not be included in the treaty. However,  under a provision that was accepted months ago, all cruise missiles that had  been tested by the end of last year -- including Tacit Rainbow -- would be  presumed to be nuclear. The compromise changed the effective date for the  earlier agreement to the end of 1988, thus exempting Tacit Rainbow from the  limitations.  </P> <P> According to U.S. officials, Gorbachev and Baker agreed to the compromise  language for both classes of cruise missiles. However, they said, lower-ranking  Soviet officials, particularly those from the military, tried to impose new  conditions on Tacit Rainbow, such as banning modernization of the missile,  restricting its range and imposing a guarantee that it would never have a  nuclear warhead. All of those restrictions were unacceptable to the United  States.  </P> <P> "In the Gorbachev meeting, we did feel that we had broken the back of the  issues," one senior official said. "The package that we thought had been put  together began to unravel because they pulled a piece out of it."  </P> <P> Another official said that arms control specialists wrestled with the issue all  morning Saturday. About noon, he said, Baker sent a letter to Shevardnadze  saying that, if the Soviet side continued to push additional restrictions,  there would be no deal. Shevardnadze accepted the U.S. position a few hours  later.  </P> <P> The arguments seem technical and abstruse, but just such problems have blocked  all previous attempts to control cruise missile technology.  </P> <P> The latest U.S.-Soviet compromises probably would not have been possible  without the overall warming in superpower relations. As an example of the  changed mood, a senior official said that, late in the Friday meeting,  Gorbachev broke one deadlock by asking Baker: "How about if we split the  difference?"  </P> <P> "Baker said, 'You've got a deal.' And they reached across the table and shook  hands."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, April 5 (BTA) -- President Zhelyu Zhelev  today met Mr. Ljupco Georgievski, Chairman of the Internal  Macedonian Revolutionary Organization-Democratic Party for  Macedonian National Unity (IMRO-DPMNU), the president's foreign  policy adviser Kamen Velichkov said. "I cannot say there were  any differences between the two sides," Mr. Velichkov said. The  leader of Macedonia's [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia  -- FYROM] major opposition parliamentary party arrived Sunday on  an informal visit to Bulgaria at the invitation of the  extraparliamentary Fatherland Union.    The Bulgarian side reminded that this country was the first  one to recognize the sovereignty of Macedonia in January 1992  and laid a stress on the necessity for Macedonia to get in  closer contacts with the European structures, the president's  adviser said. He reiterated this country's stand against the  embargo Greece has enforced against Macedonia and said Bulgaria  believes it does not contribute to the stability in the Balkans.    Dr. Zhelev expressed his desire that the two countries  develop unselfish relations based on an equal footing. Bulgaria  will, however, profit from the cooperation, Mr. Velichkov said.    The meeting between Dr. Zhelev and Mr. Georgievski was held  without the help of an interpreter, Mr. Velichkov also said.    The Macedonian guest today met National Assembly Chairman  Aleksandur Yordanov to discuss the performance of the two  countries' parliaments.</p>

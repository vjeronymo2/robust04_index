			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Dutch group Akzo raided by Brussels THE European Commission believes Akzo, the Dutch chemicals group, has hindered an investigation into what could be a serious breach of EC competition rules. The Commission inquiry is believed to focus on Akzo's growing dominance of the salt market, following the group's takeover of Dansk Salt of Denmark earlier this year. Akzo claims to be the world's biggest salt producer. Brussels yesterday threatened Akzo with a daily penalty of Ecu1,000 (Pounds 776) because its anti-trust investigators were refused access to the group's headquarters in Arnhem earlier this month. The threat was lifted after Akzo allowed the Commission to enter its offices. Akzo claims that when the EC team first visited Arnhem, it was not authorised to carry out a search. The same team was allowed to enter the offices of Akzo Chemicals at other locations in the Netherlands. 'They hadn't done their homework,' said one Akzo executive yesterday. 'We co-operate with these studies because we have nothing to hide, but when they have the wrong documents we will not allow them in.' However, Brussels officials denied they needed specific authorisation. In a strongly worded statement, the Commission said it would 'under no circumstances' tolerate attempts to escape such investigations, commonly known as 'dawn raids'. Raids are carried out without warning when Brussels suspects an infringement of EC rules, particularly in cases involving alleged price-fixing, or abuse of a company's dominant position. Neither Akzo nor the Commission would comment on the reason for the raids, which took place on October 6 and 7, but industry sources suggested that the inquiry followed complaints by Danish consumers and competitors in the salt market. Akzo, in addition to acquiring Dansk Salt, last month took a majority stake in a Danish producer of food ingredients, which owns an Icelandic salt manufacturer. Most of the 15m tonnes of salt produced by Akzo annually is intended for use in industrial electrolysis by the chemicals industry, for instance to produce chloride and caustic soda.</p>

			<p><P> June 2, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> WOMAN TESTIFIES SHE KILLED OUT OF FEAR FOR HER DAUGHTER;  </P> <P> CRIME: THE DEFENDANT SAID SHE BLAMED THE SLAIN MAN FOR HER DAUGHTER'S DRUG USE.  SHE CONFRONTED HIM EVEN THOUGH HER DAUGHTER WASN'T WITH HIM, BECAUSE 'I KNEW  SHE WOULD GO BACK.'  </P> <P> A Lancaster mother on trial for murder Friday defended her claim that she was  protecting her teen-age daughter when she shot to death a construction worker  she blamed for her daughter's drug use.  </P> <P> In a second day of emotional testimony in Lancaster Superior Court, Belita Fox  said that although she knew that on the night of the shooting her daughter was  not at the victim's house, where witnesses have testified the girl used drugs  on several occasions, she still believed that the girl was in danger.  </P> <P> Fox, 41, described as "hell" the weeks preceding the death of 23-year-old Kevin  Furman, who she admits shooting four times in his bed on Aug. 30. The midnight  confrontation at Furman's house culminated a year in which her 17-year-old  daughter, Cheryl, ran away from home frequently and resisted her mother's  efforts to prevent her from using methamphetamine and marijuana, Fox testified.  </P> <P> "You don't know what I went through with that child," a tearful Fox told Deputy  Dist. Atty. Robert B. Foltz Jr. during cross-examination. "You don't know  anything. . . . I went there to protect my daughter, and, if necessary,  myself."  </P> <P> Foltz asked how Fox could fear Cheryl was in "imminent peril" if she knew  Cheryl had been picked up by her stepfather days earlier at Furman's house  after running away from home and becoming ill. Fox blamed the illness on drug  use and said she feared the effects of drugs on the girl's heart murmur.  </P> <P> "I knew she would go back" to Furman's house, Fox responded. "In my mind I had  to protect Cheryl. . . . I wanted to tell Kevin not to let Cheryl go there  anymore."  </P> <P> Fox said she called the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department several times  to report that drugs were used at Furman's house but was told that she would  have to provide more information. Fox has also described finding a bag of  marijuana in her daughter's purse and being told by friends that Cheryl snorted  methamphetamine at the house.  </P> <P> Fox's testimony Friday concluded a defense based on her assertion that she  wanted to protect Cheryl and that she shot Furman in self-defense when he knelt  upright in bed and advanced toward her threateningly. In addition, Fox said she  was drunk at the time -- she testified earlier she had consumed 10 beers and  two or three shots of liquor -- and did not know the gun was loaded.  </P> <P> Foltz repeated that examination of the bullet paths in Furman's body  established that he was shot while prone in bed.  </P> <P> Foltz attempted to undercut the potentially sympathetic appeal to the jury of  her portrayal of herself as an anguished mother fighting to save her daughter  from drugs.  </P> <P> Foltz questioned Fox about her statement during a hysterical call to a 911  operator from Furman's bedroom that she had "begged" Furman to leave her  daughter alone. He cited Fox's testimony that she did not talk to Furman or go  to his house looking for Cheryl during the month before the shooting.  </P> <P> Foltz also asked Fox why she remained near Furman's bed for about half an hour  without calling for help and then called her daughter before calling sheriff's  deputies.  </P> <P> "You're standing over him watching him die, you didn't call for help?" Foltz  asked.  </P> <P> "I thought his friends would call for help," said Fox, referring to Furman's  two roommates, who fled the house after the first shots.  </P> <P> "I was talking to him. I was crying."  </P> <P> Closing arguments in the case are expected Monday.  </P></p>

			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Late buying takes prices to new highs Wall Street After trading in a narrow range for most of the day, a burst of late buying took US share prices to new highs yesterday, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 14.85 at 3,322.18, having spent the best part of the day no more than a few points either side of Monday's close. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's rose 1.66 to 436.97, a new record, while the Amex composite added 0.29 to 394.65 and the Nasdaq composite rose 0.59 to 667.12, another new all-time high. Turnover on the NYSE was heavy at 235m shares, and declines outpaced rises by 994 to 821. Enthusiasm was dampened in early trading by rumours that Germany might raise interest rates. Although economists do not believe the Bundesbank would raise rates, the rumours supported the view that German interest rates are not likely to fall in the near future. Otherwise, trading was dominated by technical considerations in the absence of any domestic economic data. Following recent gains the market looked slightly overbought, but underlying sentiment remained positive throughout the day, and aided by a late surge in demand which some traders said was linked to activity in the futures pits, shares put in another solid performance. Boeing eased Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 34 5/8 in turnover of almost 1m shares amid growing concern that the aircraft manufacturer would be hit by industrial action following Monday night's vote by the Seattle Professional Engineering Employees Association to reject a three-year contract from Boeing. Talks were scheduled yesterday between management and unions. IBM fell Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 65 3/8 in busy trading after Merrill Lynch, the broking house, warned that the computer maker might have to take additional charges in the fourth quarter. Various big stocks reacted to some late earnings reports. HJ Heinz firmed Dollars 1 to Dollars 44 1/8 after announcing fiscal second quarter profits of Dollars 154.2m, up from Dollars 122.8m at the same stage a year ago. Deere&amp;Co jumped Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 39 5/8 on news that the agricultural equipment manufacturer earned Dollars 37.4m in the fourth quarter ended October 31, a substantial turnround from the Dollars 20.2m loss incurred at the same stage of 1991 (although that was affected by big restructuring charges). Times Mirror fell Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 30 3/4 on news that it expected to take special charges against its fourth quarter earnings to cover costs related to a restructuring at its Matthew Bender unit, a voluntary separation programme at the Los Angeles Times, and changes in accounting procedures. General Motors climbed Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 34 3/4 in turnover of 2.4m shares after Kidder, Peabody, the broker, reiterated its 'buy' recommendation and said the stock was due for a significant upward move over the next few months. Canada TORONTO share prices ended mixed in continued heavy trading. Based on preliminary data, the TSE 300-stock composite index lost 2.23 points, or 0.07 per cent, to 3,290.86, with declining issues ahead of advances 340 to 277. Volume surged to 49,237,000 shares worth CDollars 456.1m.</p>

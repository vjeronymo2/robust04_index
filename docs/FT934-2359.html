			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / International Company News: Samsung sees sharp earnings rise South Korea's three main electronics groups - Samsung, Goldstar and Daewoo - yesterday predicted significant increases in earnings and sales for 1993. Samsung Electronics, the leading group, estimated net profits at Won150bn (Dollars 185m), up 107 per cent. Sales will rise by 38 per cent to Won8,100bn, it said. The rapid profits expansion is primarily due to Samsung's semiconductor division, which is the world's largest supplier of D-ram memory chips. Strong global demand for D-ram chips and firm prices have boosted earnings margins this year. Goldstar estimates that net profits will grow by 126 per cent to Won60bn for 1993. Sales will increase by 16 per cent to Won4,400bn. Growth was largely due to exports in consumer products, which have been aided by the Korean won's depreciation against the Japanese yen and improved its competitiveness against Japanese electronics manufacturers. Daewoo Electronics expects that net profits will grow by 26.5 per cent to Won21bn, while sales will rise by 19 per cent to Won2,050bn. Daewoo has benefited from several popular products in the domestic market, including improved versions of washing machines and tvs, its strongest product lines. South Korea will become the world's sixth largest motor vehicle producer this year and is expected to become the fifth biggest within the next two or three years. Korea will produce 2.04m vehicles in 1993, overtaking Spain for sixth place, according to the Kia Economic Research Institute, which is affiliated with the country's second largest car manufacturer. Production of motor vehicles will rise 17.8 per cent this year, the sharpest increase among the the 10 main car producing countries, and exports will grow by 37 per cent due to the Korean won's depreciation against the Japanese yen. Korea is likely to replace Canada as the world's fifth leading car producer within the next several years. 'Most car factories in Canada are subsidiaries of foreign carmakers and its domestic market is nearly full. Moreover, with the North American Free Trade Agreement, some factories in Canada are expected to move to Mexico, where the labour is cheaper.</p>

			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / Moscow clings on to east European reins STUDENTS from Prague's College of Art were told recently that they could not remove an old Soviet tank from the capital's fifth district. So they decided to paint it a different colour. Pink. Soviet diplomats were furious. There were protests, discussions, and apologies all round. The tank, marking the liberation of Czechoslovakia by the Red Army in 1945, was restored to its former colour. Khaki. The fuss by Soviet officials exemplifies the deep sensitivities which today characterise relations between the Soviet Union and its former east European allies. The Soviet military, and the older Soviet generation, resent what they see as the growing ingratitude of the east Europeans for the way in which the Red Army 'liberated' these countries from Hitler's Wehrmacht. They and Communist party hardliners are also beginning to feel that the demise of the Warsaw Pact and the cold war exposes the vulnerability of the Soviet Union's own security. This vulnerability forms the background to negotiations taking place on a bilateral level between Moscow and the east European states. The Soviet Union, and all the east European countries, want to place their relations on a new and equal footing through friendship treaties. As Mr David Meiszter, head of the Hungarian delegation to the talks with Moscow, explained: 'The agreement should reflect a new quality of partnership between Hungary and the Soviet Union, and comply with the interests of both parties and the new European realities.' But the Soviets have gone one stage further in interpreting the content of the treaties, insisting that they should include a clause which states that neither country will participate in any alliance directed against each other. This clause is already contained in the 'Treaty on co-operation, good-neighbourliness and friendship' signed on March 22, between the Soviet Union and Romania, the only country so far to have signed a treaty. This pact also states that 'the two countries pledge not to tolerate the use of their territories by a third state to commit an act of aggression against the other side, and not to support such a state.' Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria, all of which aspire to eventual membership of the European Community, staunchly oppose the inclusion of this clause into any treaty. Mr Tamas Katona, state secretary at the Hungarian Foreign Ministry, said last week that 'the Soviet Union would like to achieve the creation of a neutral region in eastern Europe similar to Finland.' Mr Meiszter explained further that 'any clause which limits the scope of action of Hungarian foreign policy is unacceptable.' A Czechoslovak Foreign Ministry official said yesterday: 'There is a stalemate in the negotiations between Prague and Moscow. From the psychological perspective, somehow the Soviet military believes that we (the countries of eastern Europe) are still within their sphere of influence; that it is their right. They do not realise this is no longer the case.' Polish diplomats are keen to stress the realpolitik of any agreement. 'There is the question of geography - the size of Poland, where we are situated in Europe. But they want us to state that we will not aspire to any alliance,' commented a Polish diplomat. 'Our foreign minister, (Mr Krzysztof Skubiszewski) has always been cautious about Poland aspiring to membership of any other alliance.' However, over the past year several east European leaders, including President Lech Walesa of Poland, have visited Nato headquarters to discover what role the alliance (and maybe their own countries) will play in the new Europe. The Soviet Union may be persuaded to back down on the disputed clause because it does not want to see the rest of the treaty jeopardised. Whatever the outcome of the discussion, east European diplomats believe it has highlighted the need for rethinking the whole of Europe's future security arrangements.</p>

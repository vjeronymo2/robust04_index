			<p><P> October 30, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> Two separate predawn bombings destroyed mailboxes and wakened residents Monday  in Scripps Ranch and northern La Jolla, police said.  </P> <P> No one was injured in the blasts, which involved "quite powerful" devices, said  Tom Taylor, an inspector with the U.S. Postal Service in San Diego.  </P> <P> The bombs, Taylor said, were "very sophisticated" and distinct from the  standard homemade pipe-like devices that are frequently employed by amateur  bombers. However, police said authorities had not immediately determined what  type of explosives were used.  </P> <P> There was no known motive for the bombings, which occurred about an hour apart.  Authorities would not say if the devices were intended to injure people or  simply cause property damage. No suspects were in custody, police said.  </P> <P> Police would also not say whether the two incidents were definitively linked.  </P> <P> On Monday afternoon, Taylor said, postal inspectors received an anonymous  telephone call claiming responsibility for the bombings. The caller made no  threats, Taylor said.  </P> <P> The U.S. Postal Service is investigating the bombings, as is the Metro Arson  Strike Team, which is composed of San Diego police and fire authorities.  </P> <P> The first bombing occurred shortly after 3 a.m. on the corner of Via Aprilia  and Carmel Valley Road in northern La Jolla. Police responding to calls of an  explosion in the area found a mailbox blown apart and pieces of mail scattered  over the street, authorities said.  </P> <P> The second blast happened about an hour later at 9950 Avenida Magnifica near  the Scripps Ranch area, police said. Officers found a similar scene of  scattered correspondence and a destroyed mailbox.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report over video by correspondent Donato Bendicenti] </F>   [Excerpts] Now we turn to politics. Negotiations between  the members of the Freedom Alliance are becoming very lively.  Last night the Alliance held its first meeting since the  election of the parliamentary speakers. Donato Bendicenti  reports:    [Bendicenti] [Passage omitted] Roberto Maroni from the  Northern League said that he was willing to talk about  increasing the Freedom Alliance's majority in the Senate.    [Begin Maroni recording] I said that we ought to find an  agreement with Mario Segni's Pact for Italy and with individual  parliamentarians. I do not think that we should be looking for  political alliances with the Italian Popular Party. It seems to  me that this view is also shared by the leaders of the Pact for  Italy so we are in agreement on this point. [passage omitted]  [end recording]    [Bendicenti] Finally Silvio Berlusconi arrived. Some  speculated that his late arrival was due to a secret meeting  with Mario Segni. However, this was denied by Berlusconi.    [Begin recording] [Berlusconi] This is not true.    [Unidentified correspondent] So you did not meet Mario  Segni?    [Berlusconi] No. I heard that he had said some things, but  there is nothing that concerns our relations with Segni. He is  asking and replying to his own questions. [passage omitted]  [end recording]    [Pierferdinando Casini from the Christian Democrat Center  shown on video being interviewed by correspondent Fulvio Damiani]    [Begin recording] [Damiani] The relationship between the  Freedom Alliance and the opposition parties -- are there going  to be new developments? Tomorrow the voting for the deputy  speakers of the parliamentary chambers will take place. How  will you face up to this relationship? Is the relationship one  of opposition, or will the Freedom Alliance be holding out a  hand to the opposition?    [Casini] We are holding out two hands, but not to individual  parliamentarians because this is the logic of old-style  politics. We are holding out a hand to other political  groupings, particularly the Italian Popular Party. There are  two opposition slates in parliament: one which is antagonistic,  that of the Left and the Progressive Alliance, and the other is  an opposition with which we have much in common. However, the  Italian Popular Party must reply to these signals. These  signals are political and allow them to differentiate their  position from that of the left.    [Damiani] How are the plans for the government going along?  It is said that certain names have already been mentioned in  relation to certain ministries? Is this true?    [Casini] Some ministries already have names attached to  them,  but the problem is not that of names but of policies. It is  precisely in policy issues that we in the Christian Democratic  Center are posing some problems, although of course each party  poses its own problems. The government must not be a sort of  boat that just floats; it must instead be sure of planning a  long and calm journey. [end recording]    [Announcer] The replies of the Italian Popular Party and  Mario Segni's Pact for Italy, which is scheduled to hold a  meeting very shortly with regard to the invitations of the  Freedom Alliance, are still negative. The Italian Popular Party  has reiterated its decision to remain in opposition. Mario  Segni has also ruled out supporting the new government. He said  that the Pact's opposition would be firm, but not full of  prejudice and closed like that of the Party of the Democratic  Left.</p>

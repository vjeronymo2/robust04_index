			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROFESSIONAL FANTASIES  </P> <P> When it comes to food fantasies, nobody knows more than a good caterer.  Fantasy, after all, is what the business is about. We asked local caterers to  tell us their favorite fantasies. Here are their replies:  </P> <P> Picture a flying carpet, a fake camel, big brass urns and tall palms. Add a  bustling marketplace complete with vendors carrying food baskets and belly  dancers roaming about. "We took over a client's tennis court and turned it into  a Moroccan scene," says Cathee Hickok, event coordinator for Rococo Custom  Catering Service, Van Nuys. "It was a surprise birthday party for the husband  whose birthday was six months away. He couldn't speak for about an hour after  he entered the scene."  </P> <P> The whole place was decorated in shimmering tones of burgundy and blue. Guests,  dressed to match the theme, sat on crushed velvet pillows with tassels eating  their food from low brass tables. The Moroccan menu featured bastilla, dried  fruits and lamb on skewers.  </P> <P> But Hickok is now thinking about another booking -- still a year away. It will  be a Murphy's law party with everything designed to go wrong. On Hickok's  agenda: "an incorrectly set table, staged fighting guests, chipped china . . ."  </P> <P> Debra Stevenson, of Los Angeles Party Designs, is so fond of all-white parties  that she has done them both indoors and out. For a lawn party she used yards  and yards of white tulle, giant white Casablanca lilies, full-blown white roses  and big white orchids. Her indoor white night was a glittery white Christmas  affair. The chairs were draped in white, the tables were covered with mirrors,  and white satin was loosely draped from ceilings to wall. The sole note of  color: metallic touches of gold confetti, ribbons and tiny gold gift boxes,  strewn on each table. The food was all-white as well, from cream soup to white  chocolate cake.  </P> <P> Stevenson says that lighting is crucial for this sort of party. "Do it in soft  pink otherwise everyone will look pale, especially in photographs."  </P> <P> Don Ernstein of Wonderful Parties, Wonderful Foods in Culver City came up with  an all-copper party, an incredible dessert feast -- and a party he created for  a woman who is passionate about roses. He sent invitations in heart-shaped  boxes covered with stickers of old Victorian roses and filled with a potpourri  of dried rose petals. The house was filled with roses, rose chintz tablecloths  and tree roses. For dessert: floating island made of meringue floating in rose  petals with a rose-flavored creme anglaise.  </P> <P> John Lavine of the Wonderful World of Fantasy, Los Angeles, calls himself the  "dream merchant." He has transformed a home into King Tut's tomb (complete with  a live black panther), served lox aboard a blimp, and recreated a '40s casino  at the Spruce Goose. His most recent exploit was taking the crew of "Cheers"  back to the 1890s at the Gene Autry Museum.  </P> <P> But his most popular theme is the jail party. He recreates a Tijuana prison,  complete with federales and fighting bandits. The food is Mexican. "Brought in  by prison buses, people walk in and get shocked out of their minds," he says,  "when they leave, they're talking to themselves."  </P> <P> And people pay for this?  </P> <P> Five years ago Julie and Michael Loshin of Parties Plus created a pre-Castro  Havana nightclub for a client's 50th birthday. He liked it so well that last  year he asked them to do another fantasy night. "We were bound and determined  to blow him away with an authentic Brazilian celebration," they say.  </P> <P> They brought in green bananas on the stalk from South America, they hollowed  out gourds, fruits and squashes to use as food containers and built barbecues  out of river rock. The food featured an amazing array of whole fresh fish and  shrimp, black bean cakes cooked to order and marinated legs of pork. Desserts  included everything from passion fruit cheesecake to a waterfall of fresh  tropical fruits. And they served it all in a tent draped in yards of yellow,  orange and hot pink satin filled with swaying tropical plants, palm trees and  birds of paradise lit with vivid fluorescent colors.  </P> <P> John Steimetz, director of catering, Westin Bonaventure (and president of the  National Assn. of Catering Executives) recently recreated a casino for a  benefit dinner. "We created a set that made you feel like you were walking down  Bourbon Street," Steimetz says. "We served mini muffaletas, crawfish, stuffed  deviled clams, Creole sausages, Cajun popcorn, shrimp gumbo, catfish fingers,  duck and shrimp jambalaya, blackened tenderloin with chile salsa, lots of fresh  oysters and other seafoods."  </P> <P> Next month, Steinmetz is planning a contest for party planners: each will have  20 minutes to come up with a fantasy party theme complete with menus. "The  whole idea is to see how good we can come out with possible future themes," he  says.  </P> <P>  Don Ernstein of Wonderful Parties, Wonderful Foods likes to serve this  chocolate loaf with hazelnuts and orange-liqueur for his dessert parties. The  flavor will depend on the the type of chocolate and butter cookies used.  "Pepperidge Farm Chessman cookies are excellent for this recipe, which was  inspired by Judith Olney, a most creative cook," he said.  </P> <P>  CHOCOLATE HAZELNUT TERRINE  </P> <P> 1 cup hazelnuts  </P> <P> 9 ounces semisweet chocolate, cut up  </P> <P> 1 cup sugar  </P> <P> 6 tablespoons water  </P> <P> 1 1/2 cups unsweetened cocoa powder  </P> <P> 9 ounces unsalted butter, softened  </P> <P> 1 1/2 tablespoons Grand Marnier  </P> <P> 1 extra large egg  </P> <P> 3 egg yolks  </P> <P> 3/4 cup raisins, plumped and well-drained  </P> <P> 11 ounces butter cookies, broken into 1/2-inch bits  </P> <P> Toast hazelnuts in 350-degree oven until they begin to color. Remove and wrap  in towel. Rub vigorously to remove as much skin as possible. Melt chocolate in  microwave oven or in double boiler. Combine sugar and water in saucepan over  low heat. Stir until sugar is melted and mixture is clear.  </P> <P> Beat cocoa and softened butter in bowl until perfectly smooth. Stir in sugar  syrup, melted chocolate and Grand Marnier. Add egg and egg yolks and mix well.  Fold in raisins, hazelnuts and cookies. Line 6-cup loaf pan with 2 layers  plastic wrap, allowing paper to extend beyond ends. Press mixture into prepared  pan and refrigerate several hours or until set.  </P> <P> To serve unmold by pulling plastic up and out. Invert loaf and lightly sieve  cocoa powder over top. Cut into thin slices. Makes 12 to 15 servings.  </P> <P> Note: Although many recipes call for uncooked eggs, the U.S. Department of  Agriculture has found them to be a potential carrier of food-borne illness and  recommends that diners avoid eating raw eggs. Commercial egg substitutes may be  used in place of raw eggs in certain circumstances. Check egg substitute  package for applications.  </P></p>

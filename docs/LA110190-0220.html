			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PREP FLASHBACK;  </P> <P> THIS WEEK IN COUNTY PREP SPORTS HISTORY  </P> <P> 10 YEARS AGO  </P> <P> "Whatever works." That's the way Laguna Beach quarterback Lance Stewart did  things.  </P> <P> An athlete who excelled in football, basketball, volleyball and baseball,  Stewart did enough to get noticed. But his methods were what warranted  double-takes.  </P> <P> Stewart threw footballs and baseballs left-handed, but shot basketballs and  spiked volleyballs right-handed.  </P> <P> "I think I have more control throwing left-handed," said Stewart, whose father,  Larry, was a top athlete at Orange High School and later played in the San  Francisco Giants' organization. "But shooting a basketball right-handed just  sort of came naturally. I dribble and shoot layups left-handed."  </P> <P> Stewart, a 6-foot, 190-pound senior, was a returning second-team All-Southern  Section choice in volleyball. His various skills drew calls and letters from  every Pac-10 school; he wound up at California, but did not compete in sports  there.  </P> <P> When asked which hand he used to eat with, Stewart said: "When I'm hungry, it  doesn't really matter . . . either of them."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 5 YEARS AGO  </P> <P> Pressure kicks were not a big deal for Dana Hills junior J.B. Hollis.  </P> <P> Hollis kicked a field goal with 17 seconds remaining that gave Dana Hills its  second big upset in less than a week, 10-7 over Irvine. Six days earlier, Dana  Hills had upset El Toro, the South Coast League leader, 7-3.  </P> <P> As a freshman, Hollis kicked a 37-yard field goal to beat Mission Viejo.  Earlier in 1985, Hollis kicked one 52 yards, two yards shy of the Orange County  record set by Gerry Graham of Edison in 1982. And his kick to beat Irvine  helped revive Dana Hills' season, bringing the Dolphins record to 4-4.  </P> <P> Servite quarterback Tim Rosenkranz also performed under pressure to improve the  Friars' record to 8-0. Servite beat St. Paul, 35-33, after being down, 33-14,  at one point and 33-21, with 3:44 left.  </P> <P> Rosenkranz led the Friars' fourth-quarter rally with three touchdowns, throwing  for two and scoring on a keeper. The winning touchdown was a 36-yard pass to  Jeff Fieldhouse. Rosenkranz established a school single-game passing record of  357 yards, surpassing Steve Beuerlein's 345 set in 1982 against Mater Dei.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 1 YEAR AGO  </P> <P> The Ball's Not Heavy: Dana Riddle of Rancho Alamitos had the third-best  single-game rushing total in county history and set a school record with 374  yards in 52 carries during a 41-14 loss to Pacifica. He also scored two  touchdowns. Pacifica's Chris Shockley ran for 109 yards on 24 carries.  </P> <P> It's Worth It: Estancia improved to 9-0 and clinched its first Sea View League  title in 10 years by beating Tustin, 17-12.  </P> <P> Said Estancia Coach John Leibengood: "Hey man, I'm happy. When I got here, they  told me I had 10 kids on my team, no weight room and no coaches, because they  all quit. We got our butts kicked for two years. We went 2-18. But in the last  two seasons, we've gone 16-3-1, and it's because the kids did the work -- they  ran and pumped weights when all their friends were at the beach having fun. It  wasn't fun for them back then, but this, this is fun."  </P></p>

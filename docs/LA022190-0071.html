			<p><P> February 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. PROTESTS DELIVERY OF SOVIET MIGS TO CUBA  </P> <P> The State Department said Tuesday that Cuba has received a new shipment of  fighter planes from the Soviet Union and that the United States "simply cannot  tolerate" such developments.  </P> <P> In response to questions, spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler denied that the  statement constituted a threat to Cuba.  </P> <P> She referred reporters to Secretary of State James A. Baker III's recent  testimony before a Soviet legislative committee, in which he said that Cuba  poses no threat to the United States.  </P> <P> Baker told the Soviet legislators that the United States has difficulty  understanding why the Kremlin continues to send MIG-29 fighter jets to Cuba.  </P> <P> Tutwiler confirmed a delivery of new MIG-29s but gave no figures.  </P> <P> Tutwiler also quoted Baker as saying that "Cuba is actively supporting the  insurgency in El Salvador, and it is these kinds of activities close to the  shores of the United States that we simply cannot tolerate."  </P></p>

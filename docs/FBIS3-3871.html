			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Chan Wai-Fong in Shenzhen] </F>   [Text] Shenzhen has decided to postpone construction of a  second runway for Huangtian airport.    Last year, the Shenzhen Government said a second runway  should be built on reclaimed land.    But yesterday, in his report to the Shenzhen Chinese  People's  Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), vice-chairman Liu Bo  said many deputies thought one runway was enough and a second  might not be urgently needed -- at least in the next 10 years.    It would require a lot of money and too early a start would  put a strain on the Government's capital for infrastructure  projects, Mr Liu said.    However, William Man, a Hong Kong deputy to the Shenzhen  CPPCC Standing Committee, and chairman of Yuen Long District  Board's Transport Advisory Committee, said construction for the  second runway should go ahead.    Because completion of Hong Kong's new airport before 1997  looked unlikely Shenzhen airport could be used to ease  congestion, Mr Man said.    He suggested building an international airport terminal at  Shenzhen airport and connecting it with the Lok Ma Chau border  checkpoint by a 25-kilometre enclosed highway.    Hong Kong Customs could be transferred to the Shenzhen  terminal and the problem of transport between Hong Kong and the  areas beyond the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone would be solved.</p>

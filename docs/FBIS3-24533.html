The findings showed that none of the  antibodies inhibited LT binding to rat brain synaptosomes, but  may interfere with channel-forming and/or secretogenic  functions. Calcium permeability of synaptosomes was not affected  by 2 antibodies (A15, A19), but completely abolished by 3 (A4,  A6, A24). Two antibodies (A6 and A24) blocked GABA release from  synapsomes, while one (A4) was only partially inhibitory. In  addition, A15 and A19 did not affect GABA release. In  combination with studies on channel formation in BLM (in no case  was insertion of LT into BLM completely abolished by an  antibody), these observations demonstrated that binding and  channel-forming functions of LT can be uncoupled. Therefore, the  data indicate that LT possesses several functional sites. These  include a receptor-binding site, a site for channel formation  with calcium-dependent secretogenic effect, a site for  calcium-independent secretogenic effect, and a site promoting  channel formation in BLM.

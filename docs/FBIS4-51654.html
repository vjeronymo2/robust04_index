			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai by </F> unidentified YOMIURI SHIMBUN correspondent; place and date not  given]    [Text] [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] What are the tasks assigned to  the new government?    [Kumagai] We have to pass the budget bill through the lower  house as soon as possible. Japan and the United States must  reach an agreement on the economic framework talks before the  Naples summit in July. It is also hoped that suspicions  attached to North Korea's development of nuclear weapons will  eventually be cleared through peaceful negotiations; however, if  the United Nations decides on imposing sanctions, we will  cooperate within constitutional limits.    [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Do you mean the government's conventional  view that the Constitution does not recognize the right to  collective defense remains unchanged?    [Kumagai] It is not necessary for the new cabinet to change  the government's long-held views.    [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] What do you think about criticism of the  existence of a dual power structure?    [Kumagai] It is important for the prime minister to perform  his duties using good judgment while increasing the openness of  the decisionmaking process in his administration.    [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Do you see any possibility of a  dissolution of the lower house and a general election under the  current multiple-seat constituency system?    [Kumagai] The Diet adopted a bill on a new electoral system.  A dissolution of the lower house under the current electoral  system would reverse the wheels of history. We have to avoid  that. The next lower house election should be held under the  newly adopted electoral system.    [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] How will the government promote discussion  of the tax reform issue?    [Kumagai] Discussions of tax reform would serve as an  important step toward mending tattered relations with the Social  Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] and bringing the party back  into the coalition.    [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] What are the prospects for restoring  coalition ties with the SDPJ?    [Kumagai] There are points we have to reflect on, such as  procedural mistakes. With this in mind, we have to talk  persistently with the SDPJ to win its understanding. I believe  the SDPJ will return to the coalition because the SDPJ agreed on  basic coalition policies after thorough debate. We have to do  our utmost to have the SDPJ back; otherwise, passage of our  bills through the Diet will be impossible.</p>

			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Nigeria reforms challenged NIGERIA'S relaunched reform programme faced its first big challenge yesterday, as the naira fell sharply against the dollar and state governments began conceding demands for 45 per cent pay rises. The government promised in January to trim spending and cut the budget deficit, reduce inflation and curb money supply in an effort to put the economy on a stable footing before the planned handover to civilian rule in August. At yesterday's Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) foreign exchange auction, the dollar sold for 24.99 naira, compared with 20.56 naira at the CBN's last sale on January 19. Bankers blamed the decline on high inflation and a continuing shortage of foreign exchange. Fewer than 18 of the 80 banks that bid at the Dutch auction were successful. The central bank was reverting to the system scrapped two years ago of competitive tendering by the banks. It has cancelled all but two of its scheduled weekly foreign exchange sales in the past two months. Fears the counter-inflationary policies set out in the January budget will be undermined were raised yesterday when Lagos state administration joined Yobe and Katsina States and gave way to 45 per cent wage claims. Other states are expected to bow to pressure from striking employees. Last June, the federal government announced a 45 per cent pay increase for its staff. Union leaders have warned that further wage demands should be expected, saying the awards should be treated as an interim measure. Inflation at present exceeds 45 per cent. The naira, which exchanged for more than a dollar in the early 1980s, was devalued by 41 per cent last March to close a gap with the parallel market. It is worth less than five cents today. In March the CBN reformed its foreign exchange system to make itself an active participant in the market, buying and selling foreign exchange at market rates. Mr Ernest Shonekan, chairman of the country's transitional council, is expected to stress the importance of keeping to budget targets when he addresses a conference on the economy beginning in Abuja today.</p>

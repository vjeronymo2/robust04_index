			<p>BFN     [Text] New Delhi -- A conscious effort has got underway to  downplay the defence content of the Prime Minister's visit to  Russia next week, in view of heightened apprehensions both in  the sub-continent and Western capitals.    Defence Ministry officials were at pains to stress on  Thursday [23 June] that no shopping list for arms had been  submitted to the Prime Minister. "Prime Ministers do not go  around looking at fighter planes" said a senior official.    In similar vein, officials said no final decision had been  taken to include Defence Secretary K.A. Nambiar in the Prime  Minister's entourage. The list of officials would be finalised  by June 27, that is two days before P.V. Narasimha Rao enplanes  for Moscow. Working groups comprising officials from the defence  ministry and the PMO [Prime Minister's Office] are currently  settling the loose ends, officials said.    The change of tack follows close on the heels of reports  that  India and Russia were about to assume the strong defence  relationship that was the centre-piece of Indo-Soviet relations.  The visits of the respective service chiefs of the two countries  culminating in joint naval exercises earlier this year had  raised eyebrows in several capitals. The Government in fact had  taken the position that the exercises were decided at the last  minute following a Russian offer, but that explanation satisfied  few countries in the neighbourhoods, particularly the South East  Asian nations.    In addition,the renewed uncertainty over the F-16s transfer  to Pakistan has its fall-out over India's responses. To this  extent the tentative decision to buy 20-odd MiG 29M is being  projected as part of the normal fleet renewal process, rather  than as a force augmentation. In any event, the deal for the  additional fighter planes is not expected to be signed during  Rao's trip.    The attempt to underplay the defence angle to the Russian  visit comes at a time when the hosts themselves have launched an  arms hard-sell including opening up their front-line Su-30  fighter aircraft. While the Russians have turned their full  sights to India in their arms marketing strategy for South Asia,  the Indian defence establishment would like the Government to  keep its options open.    The IAF [Indian Air Force] is keen that the Government  closely examine its proposal for two more squadrons of the air  superiority French Mirage 2000 as an answer to the F-16s. While  the MiG-29 is basically an air defence fighter, the F-16 and the  Mirage 2000 are multi-role warplanes, capable of defending air  space as well as launching strikes.    The straws of a potentially significant military  relationship  building up from the rubble of the Soviet Union are however  clearly visible, despite the Government's protestations. A  joint venture deal for servicing the Mig-21 series not only  operated by the IAF but other air forces in this part of the  world is seen as a tactical move by both partners. Commercial  interests apart, IAF would be in a better position to handle its  spares problem once the Russians set up service centres here.  In similar vein, their offer to set up an assembly line for  production of the Su-30 is considered significant, tactically,  although there are reservations in the IAF over its integration  into the fleet.</p>

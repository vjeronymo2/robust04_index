No specific date or time has been set for any of the tests, but  reporters have been advised to appear at Northrop Corp.'s Palmdale plant each  day just in case one occurs.  </P> <P> The flying-wing bomber, which is made of materials designed to absorb or  deflect radar, is scheduled to reach about 10,000 feet and fly over Southern  California for two hours before landing at Edwards Air Force Base, 35 miles  east of Palmdale.  </P></p>

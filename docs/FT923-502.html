			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / Finance ministers aim to boost confidence in ERM: Talks seek to repair damage caused by speculators EC FINANCE ministers hold talks in Brussels today aimed at restoring confidence in the exchange rate mechanism and repairing the damage caused by heavy speculation against weaker member currencies. The meeting is expected to discuss the apparent success of the joint Franco-German intervention in preserving the parity of the franc, as well as the temporary exchange control measures introduced by Spain, Ireland and Portugal to prevent funds flowing into the D-Mark. Although these measures restored a semblance of stability to the ERM, there are continuing doubts about the position of weaker currencies. These doubts have fuelled speculation in the money markets about a possible ERM realignment or a joint Franco-German initiative to form a group of 'hard-core' currencies to reduce the margins of fluctuation within the ERM. In spite of denials in Bonn and Paris that such an initiative is being contemplated, senior officials in both capitals have raised the prospect of a 'two-speed' Europe if Britain delays ratification of the Maastricht treaty on political and monetary union. Mr Bertie Ahern, Irish finance minister, made clear yesterday that Ireland was determined to stick with the hard-core bloc of France, Germany and the Benelux countries, even if it meant raising interest rates to defend the punt. Mr Ahern told the Irish Sunday Independent that he opposed a two-speed Europe: 'The idea of a fast and slow lane is not in anyone's interest.' Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor of the exchequer and a strong defender of the decision to float the pound rather than raise interest rates within the ERM, will chair today's meeting. The talks are billed as an important preparation for the meeting of the European Council in Birmingham on October 16, called by Mr John Major, UK prime minister, to discuss the future of the Maastricht treaty following its lukewarm approval in the French referendum and the withdrawal of sterling and the Italian lira from the ERM. The Brussels meeting will provide a measure of Britain's isolation in the EC following sterling's retreat. Mr Lamont seems certain to face questions about the future of British economic policy and the UK government's delay in ratifying the Maastricht treaty on European political and monetary union. His charges, endorsed by Mr Major, that the ERM is tilted toward German interests and proved defective during the recent sterling crisis, have angered some of his European finance minister colleagues. They brought a rebuke from German chancellor Helmut Kohl and four other European Christian Democrat leaders on Friday who jointly declared that the ERM was 'not deficient.' The British presidency will use today's talks to present its latest thoughts on the 'Delors II' package for increasing aid to the poorer southern states such as Italy, Spain and Portugal, named after Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission. Other issues include measures to fight fraud in the Community's budget, and a review of progress a proposal for a carbon energy tax.

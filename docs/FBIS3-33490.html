			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The following is a JATA report on the connections  between the MIR [Movement of Revolutionary Left] leadership and  Bolivian drug kingpins:    The MIR leadership held meetings with Carmelo Meco Domingez,  Isaac Chavarria Diaz de Medina, and Jorge Roca Suarez, a.k.a.  Techo de Paja. This is what sentenced drug trafficker Meco  Dominguez testified before Brazilian officials on 10 November  1993. At the time, Meco Dominguez was being sought by the  Bolivian courts. According to the report, Meco Dominguez  voluntarily presented himself before Brazilian police in Mato  Grosso do Sul to provide information on his illegal activities  in Bolivia.    Carmelo Meco Dominguez told the Brazilians that he, and his  partner Chavarria, held at least 10 meetings with the MIR  leadership to discuss issues pertaining to the financing of the  1987 municipal elections and the 1989 general elections.    Dominguez told Brazilian antinarcotics police that these  meetings were attended by the following MIR leaders: Jaime Paz  Zamora; Oscar Eid Franco; Gaspar Encina; Rosario Paz Zamora;  Susana Seleme; [name indistinct] Arostegui; Jorge Mendez; Isaac  Chavarria; Jorge Roca Suarez, a.k.a. Techo de Paja; and (?Sando  Kasp Saucedo), a.k.a. Checo.    Carmelo Meco Dominguez told Brazilian authorities that the  meeting's objective was to discuss the financing of the  elections and that he accepted this proposal in good faith  because it was going to be good for the country.    Dominguez added that Paz Zamora and the aforementioned  persons attended several meetings at Isaac Chavarria's house.  He said: I want to note that we held about 10 meetings before  the elections. We also held a very special meeting on 15 April  1987 at Orlando Vaca Diez's house on Sucre Street in Santa Cruz  to celebrate Jaime Paz Zamora's birthday.    This contradicts what [MIR President] Oscar Eid said on 21  February on this program. Eid Franco said Carmelo Meco  Dominguez was an uninvited guest, but on 10 November 1993  Dominguez told Mato Grosso do Sul antinarcotics agents that he  had been one of the organizers of the birthday party. Dominguez  also said he had hired a Mexican folk band. How can anyone  allege that Carmelo Dominguez was an uninvited guest. (?He  appears in one of the pictures taken at the time). He had  organized the party and hired the Jalisco Mexican band in Santa  Cruz. This party was publicized the next day in Santa Cruz  newspapers.    Dominguez added that in July 1987, Paz Zamora arrived in  Santa Cruz to hold another special meeting and that he  personally went to Viru-Viru airport in his blue Toyota station  wagon to drive the MIR leader to Isaac Chavarria's house, where  they met Jorge Roca Suarez, a.k.a. Techo de Paja.</p>

			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Kevin Maxwell and his secret London office: Link with company feared to be outside administrators' control Wives stand to benefit from football ventures MR KEVIN MAXWELL, former chief executive of Maxwell Communication Corporation, was yesterday working from the London office of a Liechtenstein-controlled company with links to the Maxwell family. It is one of a number of Maxwell enterprises which investigators fear are beyond the reach of administrators, creditors and pension funds where more than Pounds 400m is missing. The listed four-storey building on Wardrobe Place, off London's Ludgate Hill, was rented more than a month ago on behalf of Sphere Inc, a California computer games publisher which pays Pounds 26,000 a year in rent. Robert Maxwell bought an 80 per cent stake in the company which is held by the Maxwell Charitable Trust in Liechtenstein. Sphere is a fast-expanding company, trading as Spectrum Holobyte, which is expected to have a turnover of Dollars 20m (Pounds 10.95m) this year. Mr Maxwell was working on the ground floor of the building with two secretaries around lunchtime yesterday. He left at 3pm, carrying a briefcase and accompanied by another man, before hailing a taxi. He refused to say what he was doing in the building. 'It's a comment that I have made before but, for reasons which I hope you will find understandable, I cannot talk to the press at this time,' he said. He added: 'You are no different from any other press. That is not meant to be disrespectful. Circumstances have changed. I am afraid I cannot talk at the moment.' The office, rented from estate agents Sinclair Goldsmith six weeks ago, is intended to be the London sales office of Sphere Inc. The deal was done almost entirely on the telephone - something the estate agents thought unusual. A six-month deposit and the first-quarter payment were made in advance. The person renting the offices gave his name as Mr Paul Cohen, but did not leave a business card. Mr Peter Gray of Sinclair Goldsmith said: 'He said he was acting for Sphere but it was all very vague.' A Paul Cohen is listed in the MCC staff directory as group estate adviser of Headington Investments, which was the main private holding of Robert Maxwell's business empire. The telephone number given to the estate agents by Mr Cohen is the same as the home number listed in the internal MCC directory. Asked yesterday whether he had rented the new offices for Sphere Inc Mr Cohen said: 'I have no idea what you are talking about.' The only outside form of identification on the building at Number 2 Wardrobe Place yesterday was a notice on one of the windows of a planning application submitted to the City of London Corporation by Sphere Inc on May 19. The application is for an alteration to a listed building and involves the proposed installation of a security camera. At about 12.45pm yesterday the door was opened by a woman who would not identify herself. Claiming that she was renting an upstairs room, the woman said there was no company by the name of Sphere Inc in the building, and denied there was anybody else working there. Mr Gray said yesterday that as far as he knew Sphere had taken a lease on the whole building. The claims made by the woman did not 'add up' with his information, he said. 'This is strange,' he added.</p>

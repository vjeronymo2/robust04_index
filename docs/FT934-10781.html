			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Lords defeat is setback for rail privatisation THE GOVERNMENT'S rail privatisation plans were in disarray last night after an unexpected series of defeats in the House of Lords on the crucial issue of franchises to run British Rail routes. In a highly unusual move, the Lords voted three times to loosen restrictions placed by the government on BR's ability to bid for routes against private sector companies. The effect is to resuscitate the spirit of an earlier Lords amendment, overturned by the Commons on Tuesday, which ministers had dismissed as an attempt to wreck the bill. The series of defeats left government business managers facing the choice of capitulating to the Lords or bringing the bill back to the Commons for a further bruising debate. After a couple of hours' discussion, Mr Tony Newton, the leader of the house, told MPs that the scheduled business in the Commons would be interrupted to make way for an immediate attempt to rewrite the bill. The announcement provoked angry protests from the Labour benches, including a protest by Mrs Margaret Beckett, the Labour deputy leader, that she was given only 30 seconds' notice. The exchanges underlined the air of panic now surrounding the bill, which has had a torrid passage through both houses and is widely opposed by rail passengers. However, the government was virtually assured of a Commons majority for its attempt to reverse the Lords defeats. The prospects of a backbench rebellion appeared slim in the light of Tuesday's debate, when a threatened revolt fizzled out in the face of minor government concessions that would allow BR to bid for franchises where no credible private sector bidder emerges. Mr Tim Rathbone, a leading backbench critic of the bill, said anxious Conservative MPs were largely satisfied with the government's 'very positive' concessions on Tuesday. The Lords is likely to back down rather than defy the government again, in spite of the strength of feeling among peers in yesterday's debate. The opposition and independent benches were unusually full and many peers, including some Conservatives, appeared angry at the government's handling of the bill. The anti-government vote was also swollen by the high standing of the main speakers - Lord Peyton, a former Conservative transport secretary, and Lord Marsh, a former chairman of BR. However, Lord Peyton said last night that a further government defeat in the Lords would raise the prospect of 'a serious constitutional clash' with the Commons. Lord Peyton's unwillingness to take on the government again will disappoint opposition leaders, who had hoped that the future of the bill would be threatened by further Lords defeats. The government must act quickly, however, because the bill will fall unless agreement is reached before the Queen's Speech opening the next session of parliament on November 18. Fuel tax, Page 6</p>

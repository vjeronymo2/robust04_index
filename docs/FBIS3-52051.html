			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Havana, 15 Jan (PL) -- Cuban Defense Minister Raul  Castro has said that the most beautiful battle the people can  win is to avoid war, which would be their greatest victory.    Even so, he described as positive the preparation,  patriotism, and courage of the armies, Armed Forces in general,  the militias, and the people of the island, who are capable of  facing an enemy that is superior in forces and defeating it.    During a meeting to assess the Central Army, a meeting that  concluded yesterday in Cienfuegos Province, in central Cuba, the  commander of the Revolutionary Armed Forces (FAR) praised the  stability of that command and the effort made in 1993 preparing  to defend the national territory.    He referred to the progress made by the troops in that part  of the nation with regard to the maintenance and esprit de corps  of combat techniques and weapons, with more than 1.8 million  items being maintained (tanks and all kinds of weapons,  including gas masks).    He recommended that a similar effort be made with farm,  construction, and other equipment, equipment that cost millions  of dollars. He added that this equipment is now idle due of the  lack of fuel or spare parts resulting from the economic crisis  Cuba is experiencing.    Castro praised the progress made in the plans to build  people's tunnels, set up caves and other engineering projects  whose implementation respond to a Cuban military theory of "war  by the entire people" which involves the training of the  population and the creation of conditions to defend each piece  of land.    He also praised the plan to plant trees, a plan that reached  122 million trees following a program on river basins, energy  forests, fruit trees, and reforestation for defense purposes;  together with farming and fishing activities so that troops can  procure their own supplies.    The FAR minister also presided over the ceremony to start  this year's defense preparations by the central army. The  military organization has three armies -- the Western, Central,  and Eastern Armies -- and various types of armed forces.</p>

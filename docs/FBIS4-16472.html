			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Vladimir Mikheyev report: "Duma Deputies Would Willingly </F> Disband NATO, But Are Forced To Accept `Partnership' for Time  Being"]    [Text] After four-hour hearings devoted to NATO's  "Partnership for Peace" program, State Duma deputies decided  that if they are to join NATO it will be on their terms. The  role of a second-rate supernumerary waiting in the lobby to find  out what decisions are being made at NATO Headquarters is not a  suitable one for Russia.    The supporters of joining NATO on the terms formulated by  the  Americans in the "Partnership for Peace" concept proceed on the  basis that the alternative is unacceptable. Fourteen states,  including Ukraine, Moldavia [Moldova], and Georgia, have already  signed applications to join NATO. If Russia misses its chance,  they say, it will find itself internationally isolated.    As events in Sarajevo and Gorazde have shown, there is  currently "no real coordination" and the NATO powers are  "staking a claim to a monopoly on decisionmaking." We do not  need that kind of "partnership," Yuriy Ushakov, director of the  Russian Foreign Ministry's All-European Cooperation Department,  said. He argued that it would be easier to combat this evil  from within the Atlantic bloc rather than on the outside.    A similar line of thinking was followed by Major General  Pavel Zolotarev, a Defense Ministry representative, who believes  that it is impossible to expect the NATO bloc to disband itself,  "even if we try to flex our muscles"; therefore it would be  better for Russia to take part in the process of moving our  former enemies "away from containment through deterrence  [sderzhivaniye cherez ustrasheniye] to containment through  partnership."    If we remain on the sidelines, Russia will be "distanced  from  the integration processes in Europe" and play into the hands of  those circles who would like to "turn NATO into a closed  anti-Russian bloc." The general referred to the lack of a  mechanism for military cooperation with the Atlantic alliance,  but reassured those who are afraid of NATO attempting to  "discipline" Russia or, even more, of our soldiers being placed  under the command of U.S. or German generals.    The most determined opponents' objections were summarized in  an anonymous note issued to everyone, which stated that  "Partnership for Peace" had been dreamed up to "preserve and  further strengthen (expand) NATO, to establish the bloc's  strategic influence in East Europe, and to move its front lines  right up to the borders of the Commonwealth states and, in  particular, Russia." The debate discussed the correlation  between the commitments which Russia would have to make to NATO  and the commitments it has already made under the Treaty on  Collective Security within the CIS.    The military threat to Russia currently comes not from the  West but from within the Commonwealth, which dictates our  regional security priorities, General Leonid Ivashov of the CIS  Military Cooperation Coordination Headquarters, stated.    Weightier arguments "against" were voiced by Lieutenant  General Aleksandr Tymko, chief of the Border Guards Main Staff,  who viewed the problem in a purely professional light -- NATO  "will be striving to reach Russia's borders."    In his opinion, the growing Estonian territorial claims on  Russia, Lithuania's disagreement with the line of the border,  the increasing activeness of extremist groupings, and the  development of special subdivisions in the Baltic countries  should be taken into account. It cannot be ruled out that  "partnership" with the West European powers would destroy the  CIS countries' collective security system.    Gennadiy Yampolskiy, leader of the State Committee for the  Defense Industry, recalled that military production in the  country had fallen five-fold, and Russian arms exports amount to  just over $2 billion -- 15 times less than the U.S. figure.    There is keener competition on the arms markets, lobbyist  methods are being used against Russian producers, the Missile  Technology Control Regime is being exploited, and Western firms  are trying to win orders from East European countries for the  modernization of old Soviet weapons.    Konstantin Zatulin, chairman of the CIS Affairs Committee  and  the organizer of the debates, considered it necessary to note  that the timing for joining the "Partnership for Peace" program  had been badly chosen; the fears of being isolated take no  account of the Eurasian nature of the Russian Federation --  something which he called "political color blindness." We are  not being allowed access to the new "distribution of labor" in  arms markets, which makes us suspect our partners of "putting  out a contract to kill" the Russian military-industrial complex.    Judging by the results of the hearings, the Duma will make  the following recommendations -- that there should be no rush to  join NATO in this currently undefined way; that, as a minimum,  talks should be held on the entire range of military-technical  aspects of cooperation; and that a decree on the compulsory  ratification of the act governing Russia's accession to the  "Partnership for Peace" program be adopted as a federal law.    Subsequently, as Zatulin put it, work will have to be done  to  ensure that "all the relics of the `cold war' are consigned to  the archives -- that is, not only the Warsaw Pact, but NATO as  well."</p>

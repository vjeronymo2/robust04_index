			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Death sentence for white policeman A SOUTH AFRICAN judge yesterday sentenced to death a white police captain convicted of murdering 11 blacks in an attack aimed at sympathisers of the African National Congress. It was the first time a member of the security forces had been sentenced to death for a politically motivated killing, and will fuel controversy over the role of police in black-on-black violence which has left 11,000 people dead since 1984. Mr Justice Andrew Wilson of the Supreme Court in Pietermaritzburg, Natal, found Captain Brian Mitchell had ordered four black constables to carry out the killings in the Trust Feed black settlement outside Pietermaritzburg in December 1988. The court heard that Mitchell had meant the constables to kill ANC sympathisers whom he regarded as terrorists but that the wrong people, including women and children, were attacked. The constables were also convicted of murder and received effective jail sentences of 15 years each. In giving judgment last week, the judge said there appeared to have been attempts at a cover-up. No death sentences have been carried out since President FW de Klerk announced a moratorium on executions two years ago.</p>

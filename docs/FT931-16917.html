			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Matrix affair still casts its shadow: The outlook for BSA Tools AS another gloomy year ended for the machine-tool industry, Mr Keith Bailey had more reason than most in the sector to want to put the year behind him. The chairman of BSA Tools, owned by his holding company Automation Investments, was cleared at the Old Bailey last November, when Customs and Excise dropped a charge against him of evading export controls in selling machine tools to Iraq. Now Mr Bailey, a key figure in the Matrix Churchill affair, is trying to rebuild his businesses. But as the new year gets under way, the affair is still casting its shadow. For Mr Bailey, meanwhile, a five-year nightmare that began with a lathe order from Iraq has transformed him into the owner of the UK's widest, and among the most sophisticated, range of machines for turning metal components. In between have come the controversial purchase by Mr Bailey's Automation Investments of Matrix Churchill from its Iraqi owners; the visit from Customs and Excise in April 1991 that led to the charge against him; and the receivership of Matrix Churchill last summer, followed by its purchase by Automation Investments from the receivers. Mr Bailey bought the BSA Tools product line in 1986 when its owner, White Consolidated Industries of the US, was taken over by Electrolux. He began operations in Birmingham, producing multi-spindle and single-spindle automatic lathes ('automatics') - fast but relatively inflexible machines for dedicated volume production of turned parts. In April 1987 Mr Bailey had a telephone call from a sales director, asking whether BSA was interested in supplying Iraq. 'I asked him who had phoned and he said he didn't know,' Mr Bailey recalls. He wrote to the trade commission at the Iraqi Embassy, saying BSA was interested. Subsequently he had a call from Meed International, the company that helped Iraqi officials buy Matrix Churchill in 1987. 'They said, 'Come down to talk to us.' ' It soon became clear that the Iraqis were not interested in single or multi-spindle autos. 'They were quite adamant that they wanted flexible machines. Their (Meed's) understanding was that Iraq wanted to be the Japan of the Middle East,' he says. In July 1987, BSA received the Pounds 7m order from the Iraqis for 50 computer numerically controlled (CNC) lathes. He says he was told by Meed in 1987 that the equipment would probably be tested on the production of shell casings, but he did not attach significance to this as the Iraqis had wanted flexible machinery. 'I always anticipated that the ultimate use of the machines would be on civil components,' he says. That, he says, was borne out by the facts. In 1990, when Mr Bailey was visiting Iraq to sell some add-on equipment, he found the majority of the lathes were producing car spares and pipeline fittings. In autumn 1990 the Iraqi owners of Matrix Churchill, which also produced CNC lathes, wanted to know if Mr Bailey was interested in buying the company. The offer presented a dilemma. The risks were heavy. The Bank of England had frozen Matrix Churchill's assets, there were fears that Customs and Excise would prosecute the company as well as its former executives, and concerns that the Export Credits Guarantee Department would not pay a claim against Matrix's machine-tool contract with Industrias Cardoen of Chile, one of the leading arms suppliers to Baghdad in the 1980s. On the other hand, Mr Bailey needed additional product lines. According to some, Mr Bailey was really interested in acquiring Matrix's assets cheaply. He disputes that, saying the company had net assets of only Pounds 3m-Pounds 5m, excluding potential redundancy costs. The deal took four months and was completed in February 1991. AI gave a Pounds 1.8m promissory note and agreed to pay a further sum based on the value of the company at a later date. Two months later, things began to go wrong for Mr Bailey. After the Customs and Excise visit in April, Mr Bailey was charged. The charges may since have been dropped but Mr Bailey and AI are not yet out of the woods. A feud with Matrix's bank pushed Matrix into receivership in July and, two months later, Mr Bailey put Pounds 500,000 of his own money into a complex deal to buy the company back from the receiver and sell on virtually everything apart from the Churchill lathe range. In the short term, AI's machine-tool businesses - BSA and the Churchill lathe range - and its 150 employees are cushioned by an order book worth just over Pounds 1m, Mr Bailey says. The affair has left some big financial question marks. The ECGD claim - which is due to the Matrix receivers - has not been paid, and AI is still due to pay the Iraqis a promissory note whose legal status is being examined. There have been no takers yet for Matrix's Coventry site, now closed but worth perhaps Pounds 2m. Meanwhile, fallout from the affair is still worrying UK machine-tool producers, whose prospects this year are uncertain at best. In the wake of the dropped charges, the industry believes export deals to important but sensitive machine-tool markets such as Iran are being thwarted by export-licence and customs delays. 'You just can't get an answer when you apply for an export licence for sales to countries such as Iran,' says the head of another big UK producer. 'It's frustrating when substantial amounts of business are available, but you just have to forget it because it's not worth the effort.'</p>

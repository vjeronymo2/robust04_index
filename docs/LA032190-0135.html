			<p><P> March 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> U.S. Weighs New Type of S&amp;L Support: Savings and loan regulators are  considering a controversial program that would pump taxpayer dollars into  ailing thrift institutions before they fail. The Federal Deposit Insurance  Corp. chose eight states whose institutions would be eligible for open thrift  assistance but postponed until next week approval of the program itself. The  states, selected because they are economically depressed, are: Alaska, Arizona,  Arkansas, Colorado, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas.  </P></p>

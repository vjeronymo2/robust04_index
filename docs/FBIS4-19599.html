			<p>BFN     [Text] [Excerpt] Earlier today, Foreign Minister Alain  Juppe clarified the government's position on Bosnia. He said  one can speak of a failure by the United Nations, but this does  not mean giving up. Philippe Harrouard reports from the Foreign  Ministry:    [Harrouard] A failure by the United Nations, a challenge to  the international community: As usual, the Serbs are playing a  double game, but we must neither give up, nor call for  escalation. Alain Juppe was bitter when he received us this  morning. The minister added: No withdrawal of UN troops, no  lifting of the arms embargo, and let's stop shilly-shallying and  going it alone -- an allusion to the United States and Russia.  Specifically, the United Nations must vote for a cease-fire and  a withdrawal of the Serbs from Gorazde.    [Begin Juppe recording] We cannot accept the violation of  international law, which is clear in Gorazde, as a result of  Serb aggression. Therefore, the Security Council must order a  cease-fire, as we have asked, a withdrawal of Serb forces, an  exclusion zone, and the deployment of UNPROFOR [UN Protection  Force]. We believe that such a resolution by the Security  Council can be voted on forthwith. I cannot see who could  oppose it today. [end recording] [passage omitted]</p>

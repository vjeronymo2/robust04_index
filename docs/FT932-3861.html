			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: E German perlite plan targets builders OTAVI MINEN, a subsidiary of the British-based Cookson Group, will double its production of perlite in eastern Germany in a move aimed at targeting the expanding construction industry. The company, the third largest in Europe, recently invested DM9.8m (Pounds 4m) in building a modern perlite insulation plant at Buelstringen, near Magdeburg. Perlite, which is extracted from the perlite surface mines on the Greek island of Milos, is used for insulation material between walls of houses and offices and in roof coverings. The decision to locate in eastern Germany stems partly from the steady expansion in the construction sector, as well as transportation costs - perlite is a very light commodity. By locating the plant in the middle of its market, Cookson intends to gain a sizeable foothold in eastern Germany, as well as complement its western German operations. The Buelstringen is already producing 30,000 tonnes a year with a staff of 14. Cookson expects to double its staff and boost output by 80,000 tonnes to 120,000 tonnes by 1994.</p>

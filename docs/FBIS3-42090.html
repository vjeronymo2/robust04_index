			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] New Delhi, Dec. 24 (PTI)--The Prime Minister, Mr  P.V. Narasimha Rao, has said the Chemical Weapons Convention  (CWC) is a great step in the direction of disarmament.    Chairing the consultative committee meeting of the ministry  of chemicals and fertilizers here last evening, he said the most  important pillar of any disarmament process is verification.    In the case of the CWC, every nation has accepted the  concept  of verification. He said the CWC is non-discriminatory in its  approach and therefore the verification methods adopted in the  CWC can be compared with similar efforts in the direction of  disarmament.    The Prime Minister pointed out that India has been  instrumental in bringing about this convention.    Emphasising that India is not making any chemical weapons  and  it has nothing to hide, the Prime Minister said India plans to  train the chemical industry in such a way that they are able to  protect their chemical secrets while undergoing the inspection  process.    The Prime Minister underlined that India has the necessary  equipment infrastructure facilities and trained manpower to  protect itself against any possible misuse of such inspections.    In his opening remarks, the minister of state for chemicals  and fertilizewrs, Mr Eduardo Faleiro, said that growth and  development of chemical industry in India is taking place at a  faster rate.    In case the country is not a signatory, trade related  imports-exports will be affected very seriously as non-signatory  parties will have to undergo restrictions in importing as well  as exporting chemicals with respect to the signatory state  parties.    The minister said the signatory parties will enjoy freedom  in  transferring these chemicals among themselves. He informed the  members that 146 countries have signed this convention which was  concluded on January 14 this year.    Giving details of the connection, Mr Faleiro said it  prohibits development, production acquisition, stock-piling,  transfer and use of chemical weapons and their precursors.    However, each state party has the right to develop, produce,  otherwise acquire, retain, transfer and use toxic chemicals and  their precursors for legitimate purposes, the minister added.    It was originally envisaged that the convention would come  into force in the beginning of 1995. The latest indication from  the provisional Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical  Weapons (OPCW) is that the treaty may come into fore by middle  of 1995 or latest by December 1995.</p>

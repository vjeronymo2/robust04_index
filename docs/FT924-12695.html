			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Uncertainty in power industry after climbdown BRITISH COAL welcomed the government's reprieve of threatened mines and its promised review of the energy market last night. But the rest of the UK power industry was plunged into uncertainty by the about-turn on pit closures. The move is likely to force a postponement of the privatisation of British Coal, originally due next year. Electricity companies also fear that the government will now put pressure on them to raise their purchases of coal-based power to help keep extra pits in business. Under the privatisation schedule, all contracts between British Coal and the electricity industry are supposed to be freely negotiated from next April. British Coal said a review of the energy market would expose the difficulties it is facing, particularly the threat of gas-fired power stations which it says are squeezing out coal. But, the company added: 'It would require a significant change in these market realities for a UK coal industry on anything like the present scale to survive. It is not in British Coal's power to alter the fundamentals of the market for power station fuel supplies.' If the review means a larger coal industry than once planned, the government would have to intervene in the electricity market to make room for extra coal - there is already a vast oversupply with nearly 50m tonnes in stockpile. Intervention would take the form of further subsidies, or direct action by government to shut off alternative fuels. Mr Heseltine's action yesterday reprieved mines capable of producing 22m tonnes a year. have no need. The generators have agreed to take 40m tonnes of coal when contracts expire in March, but they are already having difficulty finding a market for their electricity among the distribution companies. Mr Ed Wallis, chief executive of PowerGen, one of the two large generators, said: 'We share the government's desire to see an early conclusion to the linked negotiations with the regional electricity companies and British Coal for contracts after March 1993.' It was clear that yesterday's decision was so rushed that Mr Michael Heseltine's Department of Trade had not had time to consider the wider implications for the closely interlinked energy market. The DTI was unable to say last night how it would deal with the likely knock-on effects. The government had been hoping to put enabling legislation for the privatisation before parliament this autumn. That may still go ahead, but actual sale negotiations will not be able to proceed so long as there is uncertainty about the number of pits that is to be kept open. Among the courses of action open to the government to stimulate demand for coal would be to scale back the nuclear power industry, which receives more than Pounds 1bn a year in subsidies, curb imports of electricity and coal, or halt the construction of gas-fired power stations. Mr Heseltine indicated yesterday that he would consult Professor Stephen Littlechild, the regulator of the electricity industry who is conducting a review of electricity supply prices, including the effect the growing role of gas as a fuel would have on the industry. Prof Littlechild said he would speed up parts of his review if necessary. 'I will wish to discuss with all those concerned how best I can assist the consultations planned.'</p>

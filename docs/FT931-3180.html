			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Analysis): A few more ticks than crosses - Tony Jackson assesses the impact on industry of the Budget and says the government's conversion to the cause of manufacturing is more than rhetoric This was billed as a Budget for industry, and not without reason. Manufacturers who sat down to listen to Mr Lamont with their shopping lists in front of them will have ended up with more ticks than crosses. There was more help on export credits, business rates and capital gains tax. There was no extension of VAT on food or children's clothes. There was a list of infrastructure projects, from the Heathrow line to the Channel Tunnel link. Above all, there was the remarkable concession on advance corporation tax. Granted, there was one big omission: the extension of tax breaks on capital investment. Mr Neil Johnson, Director-General of the Engineering Employers' Federation, complained of the 'apparent lack of understanding' of the role of capital allowances in stimulating investment. 'This budget does nothing to bring about the massive switch from consumption to investment which is essential for lasting recovery'. The same point was raised by the machine tool industry. 'We were disappointed', said the Machine Tool Technologies Association, 'that little emphasis was placed on improving investment in high technology. This Budget fell short of directly encouraging UK companies to invest and to meet the anticipated recovery'. But this seems rather harsh. In its whole approach, the Budget shows that the government's conversion to the cause of manufacturing goes beyond rhetoric. There are two distinct themes. The emphasis on exports suggests that the decline in the manufacturing trade balance has the government badly rattled. The stress on small business shows it accepts that small and start-up companies are the most reliable source of new jobs. The clamour for help on export credits would have been dismissed, in the high Thatcherite days, as a plea for competitive subsidy. There was none of that yesterday: instead, the Chancellor went out of his way to assert that the benefits enjoyed by UK exporters would now be as high as the average among the Group of Seven leading industrial nations. Similarly, the chorus of complaints about advance corporation tax would in more robust days have been waved away. The level of dividends paid by companies to their shareholders, a Thatcherite might say, is a matter for the parties involved. If it leads to surplus ACT, the company is simply paying too much. But the situation had two awkward consequences for UK investment. UK companies had an incentive to incur their expenditure abroad, as a means of keeping their UK taxable profits as high as possible. Just as important was the effect on foreign companies. Under the old rules, a US corporation running factories in Germany but with its European headquarters in the UK would be penalised, since it would pay surplus UK tax on dividends remitted to the US. Inward investment, it appears, is now too crucial to the UK economy for such an anomaly to be tolerated. As for small business, the list of measures is as full as the average entrepreneur could realistically have hoped for. The freeze on the much-hated Uniform Business Rate has been continued for another year. There has been an extension of the loan guarantee scheme for small companies. When entrepreneurs sell their companies, they will be able to roll over their capital gains tax liability if they spend the proceeds on starting a new business: and so on. More generally, there was collective relief in the business community yesterday that the Budget was neutral in its impact: in other words, that the government was not about to take risks with the recovery. As Sir Denys Henderson, chairman of Imperial Chemical Industries, put it: 'it was appropriate not to have increased the overall tax burden until the recovery is confirmed'. Next year, of course, might be another matter. The hard-line Institute of Directors last night sounded a note of protest: 'we are alarmed that the tax increases from April 1994 will be equivalent fo more than a 5p increase in income tax. This is not sustainable, and business wants to see at least matching reductions in public spending'. But as the Chancellor will have calculated, a year is a long time in the business cycle. In the meantime, it is hard to see that the government could have done much more without having more hard cash at its disposal. Indeed, in the matter of ACT, it showed considerable ingenuity in finding money to hand to industry by the simple expedient of picking the pockets of the investing institutions. And above all, it continued to soothe and flatter industrialists. The only way to secure growth in the medium term, Mr Lamont said, was through the supply side of the economy. The greatest threat to recovery in the medium term would be excessive public borrowing. Above all, he said, he would resist job-destroying measures emanating from Brussels. 'That is why this government will never sign the Social Chapter'. As Lord Keynes remarked, one of the crucial determinants for getting out of recession is the animal spirits of businessmen. How far the Chancellor has raised those spirits will not be immediately apparent. But he could be lucky in his timing; as he said yesterday, the latest survey from the Confederation of British Industry suggested that confidence among manufacturers was recovering already. At any rate, he has given the most concrete proof to date that the government is genuinely concerned about manufacturing. For industrialists with vivid memories of the very different climate of the 1980s, that is quite a lot to be getting on with.</p>

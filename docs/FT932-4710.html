			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Leading Article: Pay-off punch POSTEL, the UK's biggest pension fund, intends to vote against the re-election of any company director who is on a rolling contract of more than 12 months. This policy, outlined in a letter to top company chairmen from Mr Alastair Ross Goobey, Postel's chief executive, seems wholly sensible. If there is one piece of common ground in the debate over executive pay, it is that managers should not be rewarded for failure. Yet the three-year rolling contract, fast becoming the standard in British industry, ensures just as big a pay-off for a poor manager as for a good one. If Postel's initiative helps stamp out the three-year rolling contract, the fund will have done a service both to the pensioners it represents and to the companies in which it invests. Mr Ross Goobey's move is welcome, however, as much for what it signals as for what it contains. Typically, the debate over executive compensation is unproductive because complaints over the substance of pay decisions are met by a defence of the process used to reach them. The more intense the complaints over substance, the more agonisingly refined the process, and so on, in an endless dialogue of the deaf. If an impeccable process delivers unacceptable results - as, too often, has been the case in big British companies - the problem lies in the connection with the outside world. Non-executive directors are supposed to act as proxies for shareholders in the pay-setting process. If they fail to do so, it is partly because they do not hear a clear message of concern from the shareholders they represent. Postel is at last sending such a message. Though it is leaving the absolute level of top salaries to the discretion of companies' remuneration committees, it clearly wants the issue to be taken seriously. As a self-managed, largely independent fund, it is in an unusually strong position to make its views heard. Many other institutional investors are part of companies with their own chairmen, chief executives, remuneration committees, and share options - a situation which limits their freedom to comment on the pay packets of their peers. There is one other reason for welcoming Postel's move. The corporate governance of British industry will greatly benefit from a willingness by institutional investors to use their votes to back up their opinions. By promising to use Postel's voting power in this fashion, Mr Ross Goobey has set an encouraging example. Could he turn next, please, to voting down underperforming boards of directors?</p>

Examples of these approaches include, but are not limited to, summer institutes and academic year activities that prepare students in science and mathematics subject matter and motivate them to take future college-preparatory courses in science, mathematics, and engineering. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Formal applications submitted in response to this notice must be received by 4:30 p.m., E.D.T., November 15, 1994, to permit timely consideration for award.

The following address must be used when submitting applications by U.S. Postal Service Express Mail, any commercial mail delivery service, or when hand carried by the applicant: U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Energy Research, Acquisition and Assistance Management Division, ER&hyph;64, 19901 Germantown Road, Germantown, MD 20874. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </ADDRESS> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER TECHNICAL INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  John Ortman, Program Manager, Office of University and Science Education, ET&hyph;32, U.S. Department of Energy, 1000 Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC 20585; telephone (202) 586&hyph;8949. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The DOE has, as a part of its mission, a goal to increase the number of science, engineering and mathematics professionals that are available to perform its research and development mission and is authorized in the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 to ``*&blank;*&blank;* assure an adequate supply of manpower for the accomplishment of energy research and development programs by sponsoring and assisting in education and training activities in postsecondary institutions, vocational schools and other institutions *&blank;*&blank;*'' 42 U. S. C. 5813 (11).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Specifically, DOE's concern is based on the consideration that the future supply of science and engineering manpower is threatened by two factors: fewer students enrolling in science-based courses in high school and fewer students available to join the science, engineering and math pool due to declining birth rates. Students who have completed the ninth grade in high school often decide not to take another science-based course. Once the traditional math/science sequence is disrupted, it is too late for students to meet the minimum requirements for admission to college and university science and engineering programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The primary purpose of PREP is to alleviate manpower shortages in science, engineering and math careers by preparing and guiding students entering sixth through tenth grades (have not completed the tenth grade) in the selection of college-preparatory courses in science, mathematics and engineering. Therefore, in accordance with 10 CFR 600.7(b)(1), eligibility for awards under this notice is limited to four-year accredited institutions of higher education which grant baccalaureate degrees in science, mathematics and engineering and to two-year institutions (community colleges). Community colleges are encouraged to maintain articulation agreements with four-year institutions which offer degrees in science, mathematics and engineering. Eligibility is restricted to these institutions because they offer the science, mathematics and engineering degrees which the student participants entering sixth through tenth grade will be encouraged to pursue. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> PREP projects are required to have a summer component and an academic year component. The summer component must be no less than four continuous weeks, reaching a minimum of 24 students in grades six to ten (have not completed the tenth grade). These 24 students must participate in the program for four continuous weeks. The academic year component should provide enough time for meaningful followup. Typically, PREP grantee institutions work collaboratively with local school districts, local industry, students' parents and peers to ensure success. If a previous PREP award recipient, the applicant should describe the progress or results of work accomplished. Other elements which may strengthen applications include, but are not limited to: interdisciplinary approach to teaching science and mathematics; the use of role models and field trips; and students' active participation in hands-on activities. DOE financial support is expected not to comprise the totality of funding for an individual project. In FY 1995, projects were supported at 46 institutions. DOE funds of approximately $2 million were augmented by over $2.3 million in non-DOE (private industry and university) funds and it is desirable that applications for the FY 1996 program indicate similar non-DOE support. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Contingent upon availability of appropriated funds, DOE expects to make several two-year grants in FY 1996 to meet the objectives of the program. The amount of each grant award will be limited to a maximum of $42,000 or $21,000 per year. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Information about the development and submission of applications, eligibility, limitations, program requirements, evaluation and selection processes, and other policies and procedures may be found in the ER Application Guide, and 10 CFR Part 605. The application kit and guide is available from the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of University and Science Education, ET&hyph;32, Washington, D.C. 20585. Telephone requests may be made by calling (202) 586&hyph;8949.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Number for this program is 81.049.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This notice requests further that the ``Detailed Description of Research Work Proposed'' component of a complete grant application as established by 10 CFR 605 should not exceed 15 double-spaced, typed pages. This description of work should include: (1) The conceptual design and how that design relates to program objectives; (2) the target audience(s) the project will serve and efforts planned to serve that audience; (3) the mechanisms to be used to organize and manage the project, including the roles and responsibilities, financial and otherwise, of any partnerships; (4) the monitoring and evaluation plan, including how those plans can be used for possible modification; (5) the planned outcomes and how these outcomes will be assessed and reported; and (6) the anticipated significance of the project and how it will be confirmed. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Issued in Washington, DC, on October 5, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> William A.

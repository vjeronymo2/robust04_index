The prosecutor said that as of today the Prosecutor  General's Office is no longer responsible for the security of  the wife and children of the late leader of the Medellin Cartel.  Alvaro Ayala has the report.    [Begin recording] [Ayala] The prosecutor general has  officially announced the withdrawal of security that was  provided by his personnel to the Escobar Henao family. He  explained that the Army and police are the government agencies  now responsible for this service.    [De Greiff] I understand that the protection was withdrawn  as  of today. That protection had been reduced gradually, and, as  of today, it has been withdrawn completely.    [Ayala] Why did no one cooperate, and who should assume this  responsibility?    [De Greiff] That is what happens to Colombia. They want us  to supply all of the corpses and make all of the efforts, while  other countries do not help at all.    [Ayala] The prosecutor general concluded by saying he never  told the Escobar Henao family to move to the northern sector of  Santa Fe de Bogota but that they can move anywhere they want  because they are not wanted by the law.

			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Arts: So far, it's still looking good - Television During the last few years as the government has driven British television further and further into the marketplace - (Well that system has triumphed, hasn't it? Socialism is dead isn't it? Why should television be unaffected? No doubt the long march back to a sane mixture of market and social economics will take a whole generation) - with ITV licences being auctioned, Channel 4 made to sell its own advertising time and compete with ITV, and the BBC's income ever more closely scrutinised and controlled, this column has tended to make Cassandra-like warning noises about the quality of programmes. The argument has been that a fiercer fight for audience share would mean increasing concentration on populist programmes and the reduction or even abandonment of those admirable traditions which, in addition to populist material, Britain's peculiar television 'duopoly' had been bringing us for 40 years: current affairs in mid evening, classic drama, properly funded foreign coverage, arts programmes, serious documentaries on subjects other than prostitution and transvestites, and comedy which goes beyond 'Ding-dong Honey I'm home' to push and even kick at the existing limits. Though the BBC's problems will probably never be entirely soluble, as was suggested in an oddly ambivalent opening programme in a new run of The Goldring Audit on Channel 4 on Sunday, and ITV has been operating under its auctioned licences and its new central scheduling system for only 14 months, with Channel 4 fending for itself for the same period, the time has come for a cautious admission that - so far, anyway - the sky has not fallen. We are not being subjected to an unrelieved diet of populism. That is not to deny that there is a lot of it about. From The Big Breakfast on Channel 4, aimed at toddlers of all generations, to Talking Telephone Numbers on ITV, a sort of game show without a game; from a copy of an amoral Brazilian series on BBC1, Do The Right Thing, with Terry Wogan, to the sub-panto game show Don't Forget Your Toothbrush on Saturday nights on Channel 4, the mindless, time-passing bonhommie spreads and multiplies. Yet any honest viewer would have to admit that British television is still offering more good and even excellent material than any well balanced individual ought to have the time to watch. Perhaps it is not scheduled as you might wish, but what is the point of a video recorder? This new year season has already brought us Middlemarch from the BBC, an adaptation which was not as good as some devotees pretended, nor as good as the best literary adaptations in the past, Bleak House for instance, and Brideshead Revisited. One of the greatest strengths of the television Brideshead came from John Mortimer's decision to use the authorial voice-over throughout. Why it was decided with Middlemarch to throw away this invaluable technique by limiting it to a postscript (read in the unmistakeably mumsy tones of Judi Dench) is a mystery. However, even without it, this was an impressive series which showed that the BBC can - and will - still do it. It now seems highly unlikely, barring more radical changes, that ITV will ever do another Brideshead, but on Monday they did begin another batch of Granada's splendid Memoirs Of Sherlock Holmes, 60-minute costume dramas complete with hansoms, country house locations and, this week, a costume ball with fountains and fireworks. Best of all Jeremy Brett and Edward Hardwicke are still playing Holmes and Watson, the best pair ever to do so on screen. Nor are we limited to fiction from previous centuries. BBC2 began another season of 'Screen Two' with the extraordinary Genghis Cohn, a production with the chutzpah to use comedy as a means to look again at the holocaust. With wonderful performances from Antony Sher as the Dachau ghost and Robert Lindsay as the former SS officer who shot him, it was perpetually watchable even if the ultimate purpose was obscure. So far as current affairs in mid evening are concerned, until three weeks ago there was as much as ever: World In Action is still at 8.30, Dispatches (which offered an interestingly alternative view to the government's on Britain's mining industry last week) at 9.00, and Panorama at 9.30. True, at present The Big Story, which replaced This Week on ITV, has itself been replaced by The Big Race which, lacking competitors, ought really to be called 'The Long Drive'. However, ITV has been as good as its word on Network First (a dreadfully unmemorable title in place of First Tuesday) and two weeks ago screened the film about a massacre in East Timor, made clandestinely by John Pilger and David Munro. As usual with this pair it is now causing a huge political row, which is presumably just what they wanted. We are getting more vivid and engrossing foreign coverage in Phil Agland's Channel 4 series Beyond The Clouds which is documenting life in a Chinese country town and coming over as a cross between Margaret Mead and Coronation Street, all displayed in Agland's startlingly beautiful photography. And on Monday BBC2 began Video Nation, a huge 'Mass Observation' style programme in which 55 video cameras have been given to 55 widely assorted people throughout Britain. Remembering the striking success of the Video Diaries scheme, this could prove to be very special - particularly if BBC2 can be persuaded to show it in bursts of more than two minutes. To make us laugh we have The Day Today, a series which is not only one of the most original comedies for years, but one of the most effective pieces of television criticism. Trevor McDonald and Jeremy Paxman now appear to be mimicking their detractors in a. Madly determined effort to. Confirm all those quirks which. The Day Today has so accurately identified. Of course I may be speaking too soon. It could be that British television today is in much the same condition as the optimist who was pushed off the roof of the Empire State building and was heard as he passed the 44th floor to be muttering 'So far, so good'. It does seem only fair, however, to acknowledge that - for the moment - the best of British television is still looking pretty impressive.</p>

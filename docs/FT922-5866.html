			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Brittan warns carmakers on prices: European Commission report reveals variations of up to 40 per cent SIR Leon Brittan, the European Community competition commissioner, has warned car makers that action is needed to reduce price differentials between different European markets. In a letter to car makers he has warned that the Commission has decided that 'action is needed at once' both to monitor car prices more closely and to reduce differentials. A controversial study prepared for the European Commission and published earlier this month shows that there have been substantial price differences for some car models across the Community of more than 40 per cent in the most extreme cases. According to the EC report five car makers, Ford, Honda, Citroen, Mazda and Audi, had at least one model with price differences greater than 40 per cent in one of the five time periods selected for study between January 1988 and January 1991. The study's findings have come under heavy attack from car makers, but in his letter Sir Leon has made clear that car makers must take steps to make there European pricing policies more transparent, if they wish to retain the present selective car dealer distribution system in Europe. The system is allowed under a 10-year exemption from EC competition regulations, which is due to expire in 1995. Its future would be decided after a review of the system 'as it currently operates, and not just the price issue', Sir Leon said.</p>

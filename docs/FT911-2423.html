			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / UN says Kurds heading home in their thousands THE United Nations said yesterday that Kurdish refugees who fled Iraq were returning home at the rate of almost 20,000 a day but a lack of cash could affect its ability to respond. It also said it would look at the costs and logistics of taking over camps in safe havens set up in northern Iraq by US, British, French and other western troops. 'We were very impressed with the significant number of people who were returning in the Sulaimaniya and Irbil regions (in northern Iraq),' Mr Bernd Bernander, co-ordinator of a UN relief operation in Iraq, said in Baghdad. There were indications last night that the numbers of returning Kurds were growing after Kurdish guerrilla leaders lifted a roadblock barring their way down the mountains from Turkey. This followed a meeting between the guerrillas, or peshmerga, and allied military commanders who urged that civilians should not be hindered from returning to the town of Zakho, where a protected refugee camp has been set up. Kurdish leaders had denied that they have a policy of preventing refugees from leaving the mountains on the Turkish border and going to Zakho, but acknowledged that they were still concerned about the presence of some 50 Iraqi policemen in the area. At the United Nations last night Iraq's ambassador Abdul Amir al-Anbari said his government was likely to disapprove of a British proposal for a UN police force to replace the allied troops in northern Iraq. Speaking as Britain asked fellow members of the Security Council to back the plan, he said that such action would be 'naked intervention'. He said a recent agreement between Baghdad and the Kurds made the presence of foreign troops irrelevant. Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has said that returning Kurds need not fear reprisal. Britain hoped to obtain broad Security Council agreement for its plan without the need for a formal resolution, diplomats said. Following discussions with representatives of the US and France, which support the initiative, Sir David Hannay, the UK ambassador to the UN, planned to broaden the consultations to include the Soviet Union and China. President Turgut Ozal of Turkey said it was essential for the allies to remain in northern Iraq to give confidence to the returning Kurds. 'If the allied powers do not maintain their presence in northern Iraq, the Iraqi Kurds will start running again as soon as they see an Iraqi soldier,' he told the Iranian news agency.

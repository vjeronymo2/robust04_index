			<p>BFN     [Text] Democratic Party Chairman Yi Ki-taek strongly  denounced on April 1 U.S. Defense Secretary Perry's remark that  the United States is prepared to stop North Korea from  developing nuclear weapons even at the risk of war. He said  such remarks are aggravating the risk of war on the Korean  peninsula just as much as North Korea's mentioning Seoul as a  sea of fire.    Chairman Yi Ki-taek met with journalists this morning and  said that Defense Secretary Perry's remarks may be one of the  double-faced, hard and moderate tactics of the United States but  are intimidating the people of the ROK.    Chairman Yi Ki-taek also said that diplomatic and security  policy regarding sanctions on North Korea should not cause  confusion and that the president should have a clear picture of  the situation and replace inharmonious diplomatic and security  policymakers.</p>

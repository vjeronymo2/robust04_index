			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik by Jana </F> Pankovcinova and Alica Strbava; place and date not given: "Will  Party of the Democratic Left Deputy Juraj Plesnik Become  Minister Milan Janicina's State Secretary?"]    [Text] [SME] Will your government hold out in its present  form until the end of its electoral term?    [Moravcik] It should. I will do everything I can for it to  hold out.    [SME] Party of the Democratic Left [SDL] deputies in the  parliamentary privatization committee have called on  Privatization Minister Milan Janicina to resign. Several  coalition meetings have discussed this issue. Is the possible  appointment of SDL Deputy Juraj Plesnik as second state  secretary at the Ministry of Privatization not too big a  compromise, from the viewpoint of the other coalition parties?  Or is the coalition not confident enough with regard to  privatization issues?    [Moravcik] We have not noticed any differences with regard  to the privatization concept. There are certain differences in  views on the privatization of specific companies, but we have  always been successful in removing those differences. I am  making use of my coordinating function in the government to  achieve this. I consider the establishment of the post of a  second state secretary at the Ministry of Privatization to be an  effective solution that is in the interest of harmonization of  views. Having two state secretaries in a government department  that is of such importance and must cope with such an enormous  work load as the Ministry of Privatization is nothing  extraordinary.    [SME] Your claim of there being unanimity of views on the  privatization concept could be contested. The SDL is supported  by the Union of Industry, which is opposed to the privatization  of state enterprises by means of coupon privatization. Former  Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar had promised representatives of  the Union of Industry that 10 to 12 percent of the companies'  shares would be reserved for their managers, which Mr. Janicina  does not accept. Besides, Mr. Plesnik said in the Privatization  Committee that he could not accept Milan Janicina as minister,  in view of the latter's past mistakes. Will conflicts not arise  when Juraj Plesnik, as state secretary, has to subordinate  himself to Minister Janicina?    [Moravcik] If he accepts the position, he will have to  respect the minister. When I spoke about the privatization  concept, I was thinking of its form as set out in the  government's policy statement. No one has called this concept  in question. As for other issues--that is, whether the  management ought to have 5 or 10 percent of shares--that is a  matter that can be assessed and does not contradict the  privatization concept.    [SME] Could you clarify the course of the coalition talks  about the possibility of appointing Juraj Plesnik as state  secretary at the Ministry of Privatization?    [Moravcik] The Coalition Council has not discussed this  issue.    [SME] Has it been discussed at the level of the coalition  parties' chairmen?    [Moravcik] The party chairmen discussed the course of  privatization in light of the government statement.    [SME] We asked about the assessment of personnel issues.  What arguments were put forward at the level of party chairmen?  Was the possibility of appointing Viliam Vaskovic, deputy  chairman of your party [Democratic Union], as minister of  privatization raised?    [Moravcik] So far we have not reached the conclusion that  there is a need for a change in the post of minister of  privatization. That is what matters.    [SME] But the SDL deputies took concerted action when  raising objections to Milan Janicina in the Privatization  Committee of the National Council of the Slovak Republic on 22  June....    [Moravcik] As far as personnel issues are concerned, there  must be agreement from all coalition parties [before any  appointments or dismissals are made].    [SME] In other words, there will be a compromise in that  Juraj Plesnik will become state secretary and the rest of the  coalition will not raise the issue of the minister of economy,  of whom it is generally rumored that his screening certificate  is not quite in order and who has not submitted to the public a  negative screening certificate to dispel those rumors....    [Moravcik] I cannot act on the basis of general rumors. That  would be against the law. The replacement of [Economy Minister]  Mr. Magvasi is out of the question and has never been  considered. We have no legal or other reason to establish a link  between those matters.    [SME] Did you, at the meeting of chairmen of coalition  parties, consider Mr. Vaskovic as a possible minister of  privatization? Is our information correct?    [Moravcik] Because there is no consensus that any member of  the government should be replaced, I cannot confirm this.    [SME] Has this name been mentioned as that of a possible  candidate?    [Moravcik] I do not consider this relevant.    [SME] The opposition makes no secret of the fact that it  will once again raise the issue of Minister Janicina and will  try to have him recalled from his post. Do you believe that the  SDL will unequivocally confirm his remaining in his post?    [Moravcik] You have to ask the SDL. I do not see any reason  that this issue should be raised.</p>

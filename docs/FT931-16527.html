			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / M and S trading statement boostsconfidence in UK retail sector MARKS and Spencer, the food and clothing retailer, gave another small boost to confidence in the retail sector yesterday as it announced it had performed well over Christmas, with full-price sales higher than the year before. M and S shares rose 8p to 333p on the news, which followed a similar statement on Monday from the Storehouse group, which includes BhS and Mothercare. The City is awaiting trading statements expected from Boots on Friday and Ratners next week, and Dixons' interim results next Wednesday, for further signs that Christmas trading was stronger than in the previous year. January sales were widely reported to have enjoyed their busiest start for years. M and S said its performance had been encouraging throughout the Christmas period, with trading particularly strong in the three weeks ending January 2. Heavy buying in the week up to Christmas left it with considerably less stock to be marked down for the post-Christmas sales than previously. Full-price sales were well up on the year before, although, the company said, 'we are not talking double figures'. Analysts are maintaining their forecasts for pre-tax profits of between Pounds 720m and Pounds 730m for the year to March 31, from Pounds 623.5m last year. 'Christmas was not a bonanza for M and S, but it did happen,' said Mr John Richards, retail analyst at County NatWest. The chain said sales of clothing had been strong and there had also been a 'noticeable upturn' in home furnishings from September onwards. On the food side, fresh foods, recipe dishes and speciality Christmas dishes sold well, although sales were affected by the decision not to open on Sundays. M and S said it was assessing the impact of the decision. Retailers and analysts still warn against seeing the news of brisk trading during the sales as the first sign of economic recovery. M and S said trading patterns were similar to 1987 - the last time Christmas Day fell on a Friday, resulting in a long final week before Christmas, and January sales beginning on bank holiday Monday. 'Economically, you couldn't find two more diverse years, but the pattern of trading was very similar,' M and S said.</p>

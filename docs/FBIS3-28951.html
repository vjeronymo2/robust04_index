			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Feb. 11 (YONHAP) -- Rep. Chong Tong-ho  returned home on Wednesday after staying in Taiwan for about 10  months.    Chong bolted from the ruling Democratic Liberal Party and  flew to Taiwan soon after a controversy developed over his  alleged accumulation of an illicit fortune last April. "I am  sorry for neglecting my legislative activities and for failing  to represent my constituents properly in the past," Chong said  upon his return. He said that in Taiwan he had studied Chinese  at Taiwan political college and received treatment for his  arthritis.    Chong visited the national cemetery on Thursday and planned  to call on National Assembly Speaker Yi Man-sop and the two vice  speakers on Saturday.    Regarding his fortune, Chong said he believed any suspicions  had been fully swept aside following the Assembly Ethics  Committee's investigation into the properties of assembly  members.    "It is fortunate that the properties of myself and my family  were found to have been made through legal means," Chong said.    Last week speaker Yi sent a message to Chong, telling him to  return to the assembly forthwith or face disciplinary steps.</p>

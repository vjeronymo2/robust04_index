A spokesman from the DPRK's General Bureau of Atomic Energy  stressed that the nuclear inspections his country received in  early March "had been fully proved the peaceful aim of the  DPRK's nuclear program."    But, the IAEA's Board of Governors adopted a resolution on  March 21, claiming that its inspections over the DPRK's  suspected nuclear facilities early this month could not prove  whether it was using its nuclear material for military purposes  or not.    It also threatened to refer the DPRK nuclear dispute to the  United Nations Security Council.    Today's official newspaper "NODONG SINMUN" also quoted the  spokesman as saying that the DPRK had no obligation to accept  IAEA's regular or irregular inspections because it had promised  not to withdraw from the international Nuclear Nonproliferation  Treaty at present.    Under such special conditions, the DPRK could only accept  inspections aimed at safeguarding the consistency of its nuclear  security, the spokesman added.    He also criticized the IAEA Secretariat for its unfair  stance  towards DPRK's nuclear development program, demanding that the  Secretariat should suspend the resolution based on what he  described as its "wrong appraisal."    The newspaper also warned that the DPRK would pull out of  the  international Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in the end if the  United States kept pressuring it over the nuclear issue.</p>

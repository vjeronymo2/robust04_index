			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the IEC on the SAPA PR Wire Service on </F> 18 April]    [Text] The IEC [Independent Electoral Commission] met today  with all security structures to finalise plans for securing  voting stations. The final number of venues for voting stations  will be approximately 8,200, because there can be more than one  voting station at a single venue. The SAP [South African  Police] have conveyed that they will be able to secure this  number of venues.    Certain problem areas remain, such as Lebowa, Ciskei, Soweto  and Athlone in the Cape. The IEC has planned specific meetings  with the regional offices of the SAP, and SADF [South African  Defense Force], and local police forces where relevant. It is  hoped to resolve these issues by Wednesday.    The SADF will act as support to the SAP, and where the  deployment of SAP forces is insufficient, the SADF presence will  become more visible.    The Transkei police force will be patrolling voting stations  in the Transkei.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 18 (XINHUA) -- Chinese President  Jiang Zemin today expressed the hope that China and Australia  would cooperate and take up the challenges of the 21st century.    Meeting with visiting Australian Governor-General Bill  Hayden  at the state guesthouse here this afternoon, Jiang said since  the two countries established diplomatic ties in 1972, bilateral  relations have developed in an all-round way.    As two big influential countries in the Asian and Pacific  region, the Chinese president said, China and Australia are  shouldering important responsibilities for safeguarding regional  security and stability and promoting regional economic  cooperation and prosperity.    "We should set our eyes on the whole world and the 21st  century, not just on the two countries," he stressed.    He said the future of the world is bright, as countries with  different social systems can live in peace and harmony as long  as they handle state-to-state relations on the basis of the five  principles of peaceful co-existence.    He said that the bilateral trade and economic cooperation  between China and Australia hold out broad prospects.    Last year, he said, the volume of trade between the two  countries hit an all-time high and Australia is one of the  countries with the largest share of investment in China.    Hayden expressed his appreciation of the remarkable  achievements that China has made in the economic field. He said  these achievements have brought about benefits to the ordinary  Chinese people.    Hayden said that over the past few years, Australia-China  relations had grown smoothly and high-ranking officials of the  two countries exchanged visits frequently.    The development of bilateral friendly ties and cooperation  conforms to the interests of the two countries, he said.    Prior to their talks, Jiang presided over a welcoming  ceremony for Hayden and Mrs. Hayden and their party in front of  the Great Hall of the People.    Chen Muhua, vice-chairman of China's National People's  Congress Standing Committee, was present on the occasion.    Jiang gave a banquet this evening in honor of Hayden and his  wife and their party. Present was Chinese Vice-Premier and  Foreign Minister Qian Qichen .    Hayden arrived here this morning for a state visit to China  at the invitation of President Jiang Zemin.</p>

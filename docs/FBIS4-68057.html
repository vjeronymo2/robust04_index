			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 3 May (MENA)--Security forces in Asyut have  found the body of a 25-year-old bearded man, wearing peasant's  clothes on the eastern desert leading to Asyut. The body was  riddled with bullets.    This was according to an Interior Ministry security source,  who added that the security forces found the body lying near an  automatic rifle bearing serial number 6245 and 12 bullets, one  inside the rifle barrel, and 11 empty cartridge cases. They  also discovered one plastic bag three meters away from the body  and another ten meters away each containing 50 kg of TNT.    An unidentified person telephoned the Abnub police station  and said that while he was driving on the desert road to Suhaj  at 0300 today he saw people exchanging gunfire which forced him  to quickly return to report the incident. He said the site was  around two km south of the eastern approach to Asyut.    The security forces, the criminal laboratory experts, and  the  police moved to the area where they found scattered cases used  for packing fruits, men's clothes dropped on the sand beside the  road, and a small rug.    The public prosecution office has been informed and  investigations are underway to identify the body.    The interior ministry will issue a statement later on the  incident.</p>

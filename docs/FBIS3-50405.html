			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Srdjan Savic] </F>   [Excerpt] The process of internal party discussions on  policy concepts and personal issues ended at the extraordinary  convention of the Democratic Party without the party  experiencing a rift. This was stated by Zoran Djindjic, who  replaced Dragoljub Micunovic as president of the Democratic  Party last night, at his first news conference in this capacity.  Srdjan Savic reports:    [Savic] Yesterday's discussion on various policy concepts  was not a discussion on the party's program orientations, which  means that the Democratic Party will continue the policy that  existed before the election. This was stated by the new leader  of the Democratic Party, Zoran Djindjic. He stressed that the  former party president Dragoljub Micunovic would remain the head  of the deputies' caucus in the federal parliament and that his  full participation in the work of the party would be appreciated.    Speaking about the continuation of the talks on the  inauguration of the republican assembly scheduled for tomorrow  [31 January], Djindjic stressed that the opposition expects a  gesture of goodwill from the ruling party. This means that the  opposition expects the ruling party to allow Depos [Democratic  Movement of Serbia] to appoint the chairman of the assembly.  However, the Democratic Party will try its utmost to unblock  the work of the Serbian Assembly even at the price of a  non-opposition assembly chairman, because it wants to enable the  parliament to perform its main, legislative function, Zoran  Djindjic said.

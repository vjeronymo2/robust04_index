At the close of the comment period, NHTSA decides, on the basis of the petition and any comments that it has received, whether the vehicle is eligible for importation. The agency then publishes this decision in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Champagne Imports, Inc. of Lansdale, Pennsylvania (Registered Importer R&hyph;90&hyph;009) petitioned NHTSA to decide whether 1992 Ferrari 348TB passenger cars are eligible for importation into the United States.

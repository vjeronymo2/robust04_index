			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Rainer Antkowiak: "North Sea on </F> Verge of Nutrients Collapse"; Subhead: "Bordering Countries  Still Have Hardly Reduced Their Nitrogen Inputs"]    [Text]Duesseldorf, 8 April 1994 --The North Sea is no  longer supposed to be a catch basin for pollutants. In the past  it was with statements of this kind that numerous conferences of  North Sea border countries concluded. So far few deeds have  ensued from the words.    "Although the situation has improved, the North Sea remains  a  major headache," openly admitted federal environmental minister,  Klaus Toepfer, when he submitted his report on water management  in Germany at the United Nations Water Day on 22 March in  Noordwijk in the Netherlands. He thereby obliquely alluded to  what environmental ministers have been asserting for a long  time: resolutions by the North Sea border countries to halve  their inputs of pollutants by 1995 relative to 1988, have so far  entailed few effective measures.    With an average depth of only 80 meters [m], the shallow sea  with the highest density of shipping in the world is forced to  ingest large quantities of nitrates, phosphates, heavy metals,  organic halogen compounds and oils. According to the federal  environmental ministry, statistically, 75 tons [t] of mercury,  355 t of cadmium, 950 t of arsenic, 4,500 t of copper, 11,000 t  of lead, 28,000 t of zinc, 50,000 t of phosphorus and as much as  1.4 million t of nitrogen reach the North Sea annually via  tributaries and via the air. More than one million tons of the  nitrogen arrive directly via the rivers and nearly 400,000 t are  airborne.    That is not without consequences. With increasing frequency,  as a result of an oversupply of nutrients, it leads to algae  blooms and oxygen deprivation. Ecosystems along the coasts are  often disrupted. A study produced on commission from the  environmental foundation World Wide Fund For Nature  [WWF-Germany], "Nitrogen Inputs into the North Sea catchment  Area," by the Hamburg Institute for Ecology and Policy  [Oekopol], deals with the causes of the "overload of nitrogen"  in the North Sea and measures for its reduction. Author Sabine  Winteler emphasizes: "The report elucidates the manifold  untapped scope and potential for a long overdue reduction of the  turnover of nitrogen in the industry and industrial agronomy of  the North Sea border countries."    Summarized briefly, the conclusions are: agriculture bears  the responsibility for more than 50 percent and traffic for  another 20 percent of the nitrogen pollution of the North Sea.  Total inputs of nitrogen have remained steady at a high level  for years. Only drastic measures can help the North Sea any  longer.    The most important objective is refashioning agriculture  into  ecological farming. Toepfer takes a similar view in his report  on water management in Germany: "Because of the largely closed  cycle of materials ecological farming especially deserves  support in problem areas for water management." He advocates  designing subsidies and taxes in the agricultural sector more  stringently than hitherto so as to support the goals of water  protection.    The major sources of nitrogen from agriculture are animal  production and soil cultivation. With the changeover to  labor-saving mass ownership of animals there was more intensive  use of liquefied disposal of manure. In Winteler's words: "The  resulting liquid manure has a high content of rapidly available  nutrients." More than 75 percent of the nitrogen from liquid  manure is available to plants immediately or rapidly and  therefore is capable of not being carried off into the North  Sea. Lutz Ribbe, director of the environmental policy section  Euronature, of the European Nature Heritage Foundation, remarks,  however: "Only 20 percent of all fattened pigs in Germany are in  hers of more than 400 animals." In the Netherlands and Great  Britain by now 50 percent and 75 percent, respectively, of the  swine are.    Manure activities outside the vegetation period are  especially disastrous, leading to high losses of nitrates in the  subsoil. Nitrates are hardly bound up there and mostly get into  the ground water, the rivers and ultimately the North Sea. Not  only the liquid manure but also the mineral fertilizers spread  on the fields ultimately end up here. According to Winteler: "In  1980 the amounts of artificial nitrogen , an average 130  kilograms [kg] per hectare, applied in the former laender of the  FRG were five times as much as before World War II."    Experts in the federal environmental ministry also are aware  of how important a more economical use of fertilizers is. For a  long time a bill has been lying dormant there for an ordinance  on the use of fertilizer, that will prevent excessive use of  fertilizer. Hardly anyone, however, expects it to be passed any  longer in this term of the legislature. In any event, there was  no word of mention about the ordinance in Toepfer's water  management report at the end of March.</p>

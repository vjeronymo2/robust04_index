			<p>BFN     [Text] Kazakhstani Foreign Minister Kanat Saudabayev has  stopped over in Ankara following his visit to Saudi Arabia.  Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin received Saudabayev at Ankara's  Esenboga Airport and conferred with him for some time.    In a statement he issued prior to the meeting, Cetin  recalled  that two years ago Saudabayev was in Turkey as his country's  ambassador and expressed his pleasure at receiving Saudabayev as  his counterpart.    Cetin said: Relations between Turkey and Kazakhstan have  developed rapidly since its independence. Today, approximately  100 Turkish companies have reached the point where they are  ready to conduct business in Kazakhstan. The investments and  projects of these business ventures exceeds $400 million. Our  exports and foreign trade with Kazakhstan, which started at  zero, have reached significant dimensions. There is a very  close cooperation between us. There are almost 2,000 students  from Kazakhstan studying in Turkey.    Cetin pointed out that a protocol was signed envisaging the  transportation of oil from Kazakhstan over Turkey by way of the  Mediterranean to world markets and added that work on the issue  will be furthered.    Saudabayev, in turn, explained that the very quickly  developing bilateral cooperation between Turkey and Kazakhstan  proves to what extent the two kindred people value each other.    Saudabayev will leave Turkey after spending the night in  Ankara.</p>

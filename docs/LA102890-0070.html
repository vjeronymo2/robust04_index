			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE OPENING QUESTION;  </P> <P> GRATITUDE: REFLECTIONS ON WHAT WE OWE TO OUR COUNTRY BY WILLIAM F. BUCKLEY JR.  (RANDOM HOUSE: $16.95; 155 PP.)  </P> <P> Young adults tend not to watch national news, much less read about it;  middle-aged adults seem unable to shake the political skepticism they picked up  in the '60s and '70s; teens are happy to hole up in the fantasy land of MTV: It  sometimes appears that no medicine can revive our indifferent body politic.  </P> <P> In "Gratitude," however, William F. Buckley, of all people, champions a  government program that might well be the right potion to rouse us from  slumber: a "national service" wherein high school graduates spend a year  performing various civic duties, from helping old people to protecting the  environment and restoring library books. The program, outlined most thoroughly  by Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Georgia), would entice students by offering them $10,000  (in tax credits, suggests Buckley; in cash, says Nunn) in addition to a low  hourly wage.  </P> <P> It is, of course, odd to find the dean of American conservatism backing such a  grand federal enterprise, and amusing to hear echoes of Meryl Streep in his  call for more education about endangered species, finite fossil fuels and  invisible particulates.  </P> <P> "Gratitude," nevertheless, is unmistakably a conservative book, more concerned  with the effect the service would have on givers than on receivers. Through it,  Buckley writes, students can pay the debt they owe to the "civilizational  patrimony," a debt they probably haven't considered, for democracy has brought  isolation along with freedom, "depriving us of communion" with our ancestors,  with tradition and with other races in our increasingly fragmented culture.  </P> <P> Of course, the service would not rout out the roots of ingratitude -- such as  an economy that makes it difficult to do good and do well at the same time --  but Buckley's argument for it is eloquent nevertheless, demonstrating that  American conservatism still has a vital role to play in the post-Communist  world.  </P></p>

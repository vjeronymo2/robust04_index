			<p><P> February 6, 1989, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SLOW-GROWTH PLAN'S FOES MISS A CHANCE TO COUNTERATTACK  </P> <P> One of the hottest issues in Burbank has drawn a blank.  </P> <P> When a proposed ordinance to limit construction of apartment buildings and  other large residential developments appears on the sample ballot for the Feb.  28 Burbank election, residents will see an argument from the law's author,  Councilwoman Mary Lou Howard, urging them to vote for it.  </P> <P> If they look for a rebuttal on the next page, they will see nothing but white  space. Opponents of the ordinance did not file an argument against it.  </P> <P> "I don't know why there's no opposing argument on the ballot, but I'm glad  there isn't," Howard said. "I'm sure there will be some response to it at the  appropriate time. But I think this ordinance is fair. Everyone has to realize  there has to be some controls."  </P> <P> Howard has often contended that Burbank's single-family home neighborhoods are  increasingly being invaded by apartment complexes. In addition, the city's  undeveloped hillsides are being eyed by hungry developers who want to build  large housing tracts.  </P> <P> The ordinance would limit zoning changes in residential neighborhoods and force  developers to meet stricter environmental and design standards.  </P> <P> But just because its opponents didn't put their words in black and white  doesn't mean that they intend to be silent. Several developers and real estate  agents said they plan to launch a campaign to warn voters about the negative  aspects of the measure.  </P> <P> "This is a bad, bad law," said Thomas Tunnicliffe, one of Burbank's more  prominent developers. "This ordinance has unintended consequences that would  take away the property rights of everyone in the city. It would give the  outside world, which already has enough bad thoughts about Burbank, more  ammunition."  </P> <P> However, the opposition is anything but well-organized. The Burbank Board of  Realtors did not issue a formal statement against the ordinance until Friday  afternoon. The group's president, Mario Iacobellis, said the board had not been  aware of the Dec. 22 deadline to place a rebuttal on the sample ballot.  </P> <P> "But we plan to fight this any way we can," Iacobellis said.  </P> <P> City Councilman Michael R. Hastings is not fighting the ordinance, but he is  not wildly enthusiastic about backing Howard. Hastings complained that her  ordinance has "no teeth" and would be ineffective. He said it could also be  changed by a majority vote of the council.  </P> <P> But he said he supports it because he believes that some kind of development  control is needed.  </P> <P> Hastings' less-than-wholehearted support stems in part from the council's  refusal last year to place his own slow-growth ordinance on the ballot. The two  ordinances were similar, but Hastings' measure, unlike Howard's, placed a limit  on residential development.  </P> <P> The council last year approved a number of large developments in and around  neighborhoods of single-family homes. The projects included a controversial  129-home tract on hillside land. Council members also voted to increase density  guidelines on some properties to accommodate the developments.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Apartment Rate Up  </P> <P> An average of 186 residential units -- apartments, condominiums and  single-family homes -- were built annually in Burbank from 1974 to 1985. But  the rate rose dramatically in 1986, when 1,819 residential units were  constructed. In 1987, 1,117 units were built, and planning officials estimated  that at least 1,000 units were built in 1988.  </P> <P> City Planner Rick Pruetuz said the city expects an average of 350 units a year  to be built over the next 20 years.  </P> <P> Under Howard's measure, which would become effective immediately, the council  would not be permitted to increase density standards, as they did last year,  before 1993. Any changes would have to be approved by the council and voters,  and further amendments to the city's general plan, which puts limits on growth,  would not be allowed until 2000.  </P> <P> The city would also establish environmental and landscaping standards for  apartments or multifamily residences. Pruetuz said a consultant is preparing a  study, which will take at least three months to complete, to determine what the  standards should be.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Conditional-Use Permits  </P> <P> Until criteria are determined and adopted by the council, all residential  projects intended to house more than one family would have to come before the  city's planning board, and the developer would have to secure a conditional-use  permit before building.  </P> <P> Howard said the ordinance would increase the opportunity for public comment on  development and ensure that such public services as police, fire or utilities  would not be strained by sudden growth.  </P> <P> "The citizens will no longer stand by and watch our beautiful neighborhoods  slowly deteriorate through the stranglehold of traffic congestion, smog,  brownouts, visual blight and the loss of municipal services," Howard wrote in  her ballot argument. "Let's put the citizens of Burbank back into the driver's  seat!"  </P> <P> Howard and Hastings were the only council members to support a proposed  citywide building moratorium in 1985. Howard said she has always wanted to take  the issue straight to the voters.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Developers' Opposition  </P> <P> The ordinance is being opposed by several developers and the Board of Realtors.  They said it is not needed because the building of multifamily units has  already slowed.  </P> <P> They added that the City Council last year adopted three measures that  addressed residents' concerns about development: limiting the height of  industrial and commercial buildings near residential neighborhoods, increasing  parking requirements on apartment and office buildings, and creating buffer  zones between single-family neighborhoods and neighborhoods with higher  density.  </P> <P> "This ordinance is like kicking a dead dog," said Michael Cusumano, vice  president of Cusumano Development in Burbank, another of the city's largest  residential and commercial developers.  </P> <P> "At what point do you keep beating our heads against the wall?" he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Small Builders Affected  </P> <P> The opponents said requiring developers to get conditional-use permits for all  multifamily dwellings would hurt the small "mom-and-pop" builders.  </P> <P> "Someone couldn't even build a duplex on their property without going before  the city and the planning board, even if their property were zoned for that,"  Iacobellis said. "The large developers can handle going through the  conditional-use process, but the smaller builders cannot."  </P> <P> Iacobellis and other developers added that city codes regulating development  should not be set in stone. He said the proposed ordinance would have prevented  the rezoning last year of several acres in the Mariposa Triangle, a  single-family neighborhood where residents are allowed to keep horses.  </P> <P> Since the 1940s, part of the area had been zoned for light-industrial use to  accommodate horse stables. But last year, residents protested when a developer  tried take advantage of the zoning to build a public storage building.  </P> <P> Bending to the community's wishes, city officials worked out an exchange with  the developer for other property in the city, and the area was more strictly  zoned to fit with the surrounding single-family homes and stables.  </P> <P> Opponents of Howard's proposed ordinance also claimed that it would prohibit  the rehabilitation of blighted areas and prevent the reconstruction of existing  buildings destroyed by fire, earthquakes or other causes.  </P></p>

			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / International Company News: Paribas offers to repay Italcementi FFr500m PARIBAS, the French investment bank, has offered to repay FFr500m (Dollars 96.1m) of the FFr6bn it received for the sale of a controlling stake in Ciments Francais to Italcementi, the Italian cement group. The settlement, which would be shared with Mediobanca, the adviser to Italcementi, follows the discovery by Italcementi of FFr1.05bn in off-balance sheet financial dealings at Ciments Francais. Italcementi did not formally accept the offer, but the two sides have been working closely on terms for a settlement. Ciments Francais yesterday disclosed the dealings had cost it FFr655m in exceptional losses during the first six months of this year, triggering a fall from net profits of FFr113m in the first half of 1991 to a net loss of FFr740m in the same period of 1992. Mr Bernard Laplace, who took over as chairman this month after the resignation of Mr Pierre Conso, said the off-balance sheet dealings had taken place, without the knowledge of Ciments Francais' board or auditors, between January 1 1989 and September 30 this year. He said the proceeds had been used to finance its expansion in Spain and Portugal. However, the cost to the group in the first half was composed of FFr251m in direct losses and FFr404m of financial costs. Dealings in the shares of Guintoli, a construction company associated with Ciments Francais, were responsible for between FFr250m and FFr350m of the off-balance sheet transaction. Paribas refused to comment on press speculation that it may make an offer for Guintoli as part of an agreement with Italcementi and Mediobanca and that it would take on part of Ciments Francais' off-balance sheet liabilities. As part of their agreement Paribas and Italcementi would each provide loans of FFr300m to Ciments Francais to recapitalise the company which, even before the disclosure of its exceptional losses, was suffering from the depressed state of the European construction market. Without the exceptional debit Ciments Francais would have made a loss of FFr85m in the first half of this year on turnover which slipped from FFr7.97bn to FFr7.57bn. It is not clear whether Paribas, which still owns 34 per cent of Ciments Francais, will have to adjust its own first-half figures to allow for the latter's unexpectedly heavy losses. Paribas' shares yesterday fell FFr12.5 to FFr330.5. The French bank had originally anticipated a profit of FFr800m on the Ciments Francais deal. Lex, Page 22</p>

			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Arts: Under-sung piano virtuoso THE PIANIST Martin Jones surfaces too rarely in London, but on Wednesday he addressed himself to the Wigmore Hall's new Bosendorfer with bracing effect. Like Hamish Milne and John Bingham, he is an under-sung British virtuoso with ideas and an enterprising repertoire. His Wigmore programme surveyed solid Jones territory: first early Brahms, big-boned and rangy, and then a string of virtuoso piano-transcriptions, stuffed with notes and with outrageous challenges to the performer. He began by expounding the Brahms Variations on an Original Theme, op. 21 no. 1, coolly and selflessly - shapely, consequent, unforced. Then the C major Sonata, the First, took him into high gear (young Brahms was himself a doughty virtuoso): intrepid speeds, and even in rapid-fire chords the satisfying, well-balanced crunch of a masterly attack. From the start it was strong and buoyant; also slightly tight-lipped, for Jones's rhythms are often taut to the point of brittleness. Brahms's varied piano-textures were gorgeously realised; the Andante was sober and sincere, the Scherzo less than 'con fuoco', without much dance-pulse. In the second half, every one of the transcriptions - a dubious genre, of course, but wickedly enticing - boasted passages of brilliant authority. Percy Grainger's 'ramble' around the last Rosenkavalier duet does indeed ramble, and closer sympathy with how live sopranos sing their limpid lines might have lit up the lyrical base of the exercise better; but the surroundings were prettily crystalline. Similarly in Godowsky's irresistible 'concert paraphrase' on Die Fledermaus: part of the fun must lie in the combination of wild, extraneous arabesques with the rollicking songs we all know and love - but the songs really need to rollick, and to breathe. Here they were paler than that, like the voice line in Godowsky's version of Richard Strauss's 'Standchen', the only strand that faltered in an otherwise delectable performance. Jones made a slow-motion idyll of the famous Albeniz Tango in Godowsky's elaboration, a sort of decadent dream about the simple, unforgettable original. I draw the line at Godowsky's treatment of the same composer's 'Triana': like all the other pieces in his Iberia Suite, the spareness and precision of the original piano-writing - however explosive, from time to time - are essential to its musical virtue, and surplus upholstery means a net loss. In Dohnanyi's arrangement of the 'Schatz' waltz of Johann Strauss II (new to me), Jones brought the pianistic roulades as much to tingling life as he did in the Fledermaus paraphrase. He is not, however, a great waltzer. In both pieces we missed any confident, shameless Schwung. A canny pianist like him should notice that Dohnanyi and Godowsky cram in more titivations than can possibly be accommodated within a strict beat (which will therefore limp at saturation-points, while you try to get all the notes in), whereas a properly skewed, swinging pulse will make room for the overload without seeming to miss a step. Jones should practise unbending.</p>

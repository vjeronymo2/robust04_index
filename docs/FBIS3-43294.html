			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A self-proclaimed APLA [Azanian People's Liberation  Army] commander says an elite unit of the PAC's [Pan-Africanist  Congress] military wing carried out the Heidelberg Tavern  attack. This claim has been made in a telephone call to THE  CITIZEN newspaper. John Matham has the details:    THE CITIZEN reports that a man calling himself Karl Zimbiri  phoned the paper and identified himself using a pre-arranged  code word established several months ago. Zimbiri reportedly  said that an elite unit called the People's Concern had carried  out both the Heidelberg attack and the St James Church massacre  in July. Zimbiri says the unit is still in the country ready to  strike again. He says it is propaganda to suggest that the unit  has fled to Transkei. Zimbiri says the People's Concern is a  special unit formed 10 months ago as a sub-structure of APLA.  He says the unit consists of APLA's best people who have been  trained in countries around the world. The PAC does not want to  comment on the alleged existence of a special unit. The Law and  Order Ministry has not been available for comment.</p>

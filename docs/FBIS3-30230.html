			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mladen Krsmanovic on Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's </F> address to a rally in Bijeljina; Zhirinovskiy speaks in Russian  fading into Serbo-Croatian translation -- recorded]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Krsmanovic] Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy, president of the Russian liberals, took the floor  at the rally amid tumultuous applause. Addressing the rally,  Zhirinovskiy said he had come from Russia which, although far  away in the north, had close fraternal links with the Serb  nation. He said: We consider you as our brothers. I represent  the party that won at Russia's first free elections. Our party  came first. The Russian people elected this party knowing that  it was the party of a new Russia, the party of a new foreign  policy, the party of cooperation with the Serb people, and added:    [Zhirinovskiy] I promise you that I will make radical  changes  in policy very soon. I have already demanded that Minister  Kozyrev tell the entire world clearly that the Russian  Government and the Russian parliament are on the side of the  Serb people.    [Krsmanovic] After this Zhirinovskiy pointed out that there  were different countries in the territory of former Yugoslavia  bearing different names. He said this territory was once called  Bosnia-Herzegovina, but it is the Serbs who are living in this  region. They should be asked if and when a new name is given to  this country and when the borders of Serbia are determined, said  Zhirinovskiy and added:    [Zhirinovskiy] Catholics from the West, Muslims from the  East, some enemy forces from the North--they all want to take a  chunk of Greater Serbia for themselves, and they think that we  will agree to it. We will never agree to it and Russia will  help you. It will punish those who want to divide the Serb  land. This policy has been going on for 100 years now. Every  50 years they start a war in the Balkans or somewhere else, and  each time the victims are the Serb and the Russian people. Our  message to the whole world today is that a new historic era is  in the making. We shall put an end to the policy of playing  games with the destinies of the Serb and Russian people once and  for all.    [Krsmanovic] Addressing more than 15,000 people gathered in  the square of King Peter I the Liberator in Bijeljina,  Zhirinovskiy said that he was speaking from the center of  Serbia, from the seat of the territories which have historically  and by right belonged to the Serb people. He made a special  note of Russian solidarity.    [Zhirinovskiy] I would like to give you some encouragement.  The governments of some foreign countries that have applied  (?methods of) pressure are now threatening air strikes because  their other policy has failed. If one single bomb falls on a  Serb town I warn them, on behalf of the strongest party in the  Russian parliament, that this is a declaration of war against  Russia and that we will punish them for it. They have two  standards of democracy: According to them, the destruction of  Serbs and Russians is democracy. But when we defend ourselves,  they call it fascism. We do not fall for these double standards.  I therefore hope that the Serbs become even stronger. I wish  you courage, strength, and optimism. Look ahead proudly as a  great nation. The great Russian nation is behind you.    [Krsmanovic] Zhirinovskiy ended his speech with these words  to the rally in Bijeljina today: We have one church, one  language, one history--the same destiny. This destiny will be a  happy one in the 21st century, and the future will be happy for  all Russians and all Serbs.    This afternoon Zhirinovskiy is expected to meet Milan  Martic,  president of the republic of Serb Krajina, in Vukovar.</p>

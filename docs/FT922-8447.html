			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Survey of The Reforming of Russia (1): The pessimists have so far been confounded - Russia's political and social fabric has borne recent shocks with astonishing resilience A RUSSIA reforming is a vertiginous place. So many questions are open: so many issues are not resolved, the resolution of so many of these seems unattainable; so many movements and trends point to deepening chaos; and yet, so many signs of hope and optimism now appear from beneath the constitutional and institutional rubble of the collapsed Soviet imperium. The best of times for chroniclers, it is the worst of times for forecasters: who, either Russian or foreigner, could weigh with a hope of certainty, the competing masses of threats and possibilities? Say the Russian people must rise against the privations they are experiencing, and you must counterpoise a history of stoic endurance of much worse. Say the shoots of enterprise are bursting out, and court instant contradiction by a still powerful, enterprise-hating bureaucrat. Say that the centre cannot make its writ run throughout the country now that Party and state control has collapsed, and you must at the same time admit that Washington DC had little purchase on many of the states of the Union at the same time as the US was bounding ahead of the old world a century ago. Pessimists and optimists both find themselves on shifting ground, confounded by the last person they met. Such is the nature of the continuing Russian revolution: the judgments made on its outcomes in more settled times will no doubt trace lines of inevitability: they are not apparent now. In times no more settled but more predictable, two years ago, the FT published a large survey on what was still not the former Soviet Union. Its motif was less of reform than of disintegration: of national and economic struggles still constrained by a weight of a Party which sought to monopolise political activity everywhere except, arguably, the Baltics: of the maintenance of a Union which, for example, the Ukraine, still dourly upheld. Much of what has happened since that time was still held then, by Russians and other Soviets and foreigners, as unthinkably dangerous. It is one of the signs of hope that few of these dangers have (yet) come to pass. The collapse of Union and Party authority since that time has been more or less complete, though of course the effects will still course through politics here and abroad for years to come. The putsch in August of last year delivered a coup de grace to a political process which was pretty far advanced - clearing the way for national agendas which had been held in check by, among other things, fear of just such a reaction. The fear, however, was of one rather better organised and more ruthless than the real thing luckily turned out to be. RUSSIA, with half-Russian inhabited Kazakhstan, clung on to the Union longer than any other state: it signed the Union treaty which Mr Mikhail Gorbachev (now a pensioner) had begged and wheedled all to acknowledge. But months before Mr Gorbachev read his uncharacteristically brief statement of resignation just before last Christmas, it was clear this was an empty shell: and Russia, with the two other Slav states of Ukraine and Belorussia, had become a founder member of the Commonwealth of Independent States, later extended to all other former Soviet republics save the three Baltic countries and Georgia - which, under the leadership of Mr Zviad Gamsakhurdia, refused to accede on the grounds that it was a front for Russian imperialism and now, under the leadership of Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, is not signing because the CIS has proved to be a front for nothing very much at all. It is still a little too early to write the obituary of the commonwealth: later this week, the leaders of the commonwealth should meet in Tashkent, in Uzbekistan, for what the most enthusiastic of the CIS presidents, Mr Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan, has said must be a make-or-break meeting. None of the elements which must necessarily attend a successful co-operative alliance state have been developed: there is no functioning autonomous centre: no mechanism for confronting disputes except bilateral contacts (which could function as well between states not linked in the CIS); less and less of a common army, as Russia, the paymaster of the 'CIS forces' now concentrates on building up its own military. The only function it seems to have is that which Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the subtle Ukrainian president, has outlined for it: of seeking to conduct a civilised divorce. Even that, however, is not yet really being undertaken: there has been no division of Union property, except on the rough justice principle of each state taking what is on its territory - thus producing the absurdity of little Belorussia being a 'nuclear power,' and of poor Kazakhstan having the capacity, at Baikanur, to launch satellites. This leaves Russia on its own: a nation shorn of its external Soviet (and Tsarist) empire - though containing, in the numerous ethnic groups within its borders, the traces of much earlier imperial expansion. As Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, saw just about two years ago, Russia was the prize which was most desirable to win as the Union faltered and fell. His political instincts gave him a better feeling for the movement of forces than was apparently available to Mr Gorbachev, and has left him in command as the former struggles to retain his visibility on the sidelines. Yet Mr Yeltsin's inheritance is a daunting one, even for a spirit as resilient as his has proved to be. Like the symbols of Soviet power which remain everywhere visible throughout Russia, the economy, the society and the institutions remain substantially unreformed and retain a large latent power, if not to recover a former authority, then certainly to block change and to force compromise. At the Congress of Peoples' Deputies in April, it was apparent that the majority of that particular unreformed body - whose deputies still owed their election to the system under which seats were allocated to the Party and its front organisations - was hostile to the government's economic reforms, in revolt against the special presidential powers to select the government and push through decrees and reluctant to even discuss new drafts of a constitution. Declaration of support Under the pressure of the government's threatened resignation, the parliament was led to agree a declaration of support for the economic reforms: but Mr Yeltsin was put under notice to propose a new government, including a replacement for himself as Prime Minister, within three months - while the draft constitutions were not even brought to the floor of the Congress. In this case, the unreformed nature of the Congress suited Mr Yeltsin and the government: for had it been democratically elected, with a clear mandate from the people, its criticisms and decisions would have carried more weight. As it is, Mr Yeltsin is able to again go to the country with his own version of a constitution crafted to give him, as President, full powers to appoint governments and to issue decrees. His supporters in the democratic parties are now setting about collecting the necessary a million signatures to hold such a referendum: it will be divisive, but he must now assume that his popularity, and the present lack of an alternative figure to challenge his pre-eminence as a politician, will see it through. He can also profit by the disarray among the emerging political parties and groups. The communists, now under various banners, showed, during the Congress, that they had little force on their own: only when allied to the nationalists could they be decisive. However, that alliance is a distrustful and tense one, with each group seeking to maximise its position and often enmired in ideological disputes of little interest to the public. The various democrats are similarly split and distrustful, but with various degrees of reluctance are prepared to back the government programme, and the president, for lack of an alternative. The next few months are a critical period: the government, having won support from the Group of Seven countries and the IMF to the tune of Dollars 24bn in backing for their economic programme, must now implement it: the government must keep credit tight, attempt to move towards rouble convertibility, put more effort behind privatisation of small businesses and the transformation of the larger state companies into joint stock enterprises. If they succeed, they will force companies to adapt: that adaptation will, in turn, cause bankruptcies and unemployment - the malign result of a much-needed movement. More shocks are yet to come. The political and social fabric has so far borne such shocks with astonishing resilience, confounding the pessimists at home and abroad. Russia, today, is a much more open, much less threatening place, with relatively free media and with a broad space given to the profession of faith and opinion. The potential for reaction and chaos is clear: yet the possibilities for its full membership of and integration in world society has never been greater.</p>

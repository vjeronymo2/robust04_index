			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Singapore grants second mobile cellular licence Singapore yesterday confirmed its intention to begin liberalising its telecommunications services by granting a second licence to operate mobile cellular services in 1997, writes Andrew Adonis. Mr Mah Bow Tan, Singapore's communications minister, said the move reflected Singapore's 'pro-competition' stance, and its determination to make the country a telecoms hub for Asia. However, Singapore's fixed-wire network will remain a monopoly for Singapore Telecom for another 13 years, and analysts doubted the value of the mobile cellular contract on its own. Singapore already has one of the world's highest levels of cellular phone usage per head - 6.2 cellular subscribers per 100 people - and the new operator will not be able to launch a network for another three years.</p>

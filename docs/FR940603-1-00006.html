			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A notice of intent to prepare an EIS will be published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  as soon as it is determined that a proposed major Federal action has the potential to affect significantly the quality of the human environment. The notice may include a preliminary scope of environmental study. All public and other involvement in APHIS' EIS process, including the scoping process, commenting on draft documents, and participation in the preparation of any supplemental documents, will be pursuant to the CEQ implementing regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Early public and other agency involvement is especially useful in the EA process where exigent circumstances (animal disease or plant pest outbreaks, for example) require rapid APHIS response. In such an event, any EA comment period would, of necessity, be extremely abbreviated. Opportunities for early public involvement in the EA process will be announced in the same fashion as the availability of EA's and findings of no significant impact, as specified in &sect;372.8(b)(3). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1506.6 of the CEQ regulations requires agencies to involve the public and others in implementing their NEPA procedures which, according to CEQ, ``includes public involvement in the preparation of EA's and findings of no significant impact. These are public ``environmental documents'' under &sect;1506.6(b), and, therefore, agencies must give public notice of their availability'' (CEQ, Forty Most Asked Questions Concerning CEQ's National Environmental Policy Act Regulations, 46 FR 18037, March 23, 1981). Notification of the availability of EA's and findings of no significant impact for proposed activities will be published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , unless it is determined that the effects of the action are primarily of local concern. Where the effects of the action are primarily of local concern, notice will normally be provided through publication of notice in a local or area newspaper of general circulation, or through the provisions of Executive Order 12372, Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs. Under this order, the State would act as a clearinghouse for review and public notice of the EA.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> the regulations implementing Executive Order 12372_Intergovernmental Review of Department of Agriculture Programs and Activities, 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All environmental documents, comments received, and any underlying documents, including interagency correspondence where such correspondence transmits comments of Federal agencies on the environmental impact of proposals for which documents were prepared, will be made available to the public upon request. Materials to be made available will be provided without charge, to the extent practicable, or at a fee which is not more than the actual cost of reproducing copies required to be sent to other Federal agencies, including CEQ. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Processing and Use of Environmental Documents (Section 372.9) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section would satisfy provisions of the CEQ regulations designed ``to ensure that decisions are made in accordance with the policies and purposes of the Act'' (40 CFR 1505.1). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EA's will be forwarded immediately upon completion to the decisionmaker for a determination of whether the proposed action may have significant effects on the human environment, and for the execution, as appropriate, of a finding of no significant impact or a notice of intent to prepare an EIS. At this time, the EA's will be made available consistent with the notification provisions of &sect;372.8 of these procedures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments, if any, will be transmitted, together with any analyses and recommendations, to the APHIS decisionmaker who may then take appropriate action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Changes to environmental assessments and findings of no significant impact which are prompted by comments, new information, or any other source, will normally be announced in the same manner as the notice of availability (except that all commenters will be mailed copies of changes directly) prior to implementing the proposed action or any alternative. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EIS's will be processed according to the CEQ regulations from inception (publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of the notice of intent) to completion (publication of a final environmental impact statement or a supplement). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For rulemaking or adjudicatory proceedings, relevant environmental documents, comments, and responses will be part of the administrative record. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For all APHIS activity that is subject to the NEPA process, the environmental record, including comments and responses, will accompany proposals through the existing review process. The APHIS decisionmaking for each NEPA document will consider the range of alternatives discussed in environmental documents in reaching their determinations on the merits of proposed actions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Supplementing Environmental Impact Statements (Section 372.10) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section describes how supplemental EIS's are introduced into the administrative record. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The decision to prepare a supplemental EIS is similar to the decision to prepare an EIS in the first instance. As such, that decision turns on a myriad of factors. But once a decision to supplement an EIS is made, a notice of intent will be published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , which in effect serves to reopen the administrative record. The supplemental document will then be processed in the same fashion (exclusive of scoping) as a draft and a final statement, unless alternative procedures are approved by CEQ. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. The rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866, and, therefore, has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These proposed procedures satisfy the requirement to implement CEQ's NEPA regulations and have been designed to reduce to a minimum the regulatory burden on small entities and all other individuals and organizations, public and private. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under these circumstances, the Administrator of APHIS has determined that these procedures would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12372 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This program/activity is listed in the catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.025 and is subject to Executive Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. (See 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12778 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. If these proposed procedures are adopted: (1) All State and local laws and regulations that are in conflict with these procedures will be preempted; (2) no retroactive effect will be given to this rule; and (3) administrative proceedings will not be required before parties may file suit in court challenging this rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> The National Environmental Policy Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 372.5(b)(1) of these proposed procedures provides, in part, that an EA will normally be prepared for ``rulemaking proposals that *&blank;*&blank;* may affect opportunities for the public, nongovernmental organizations, and others to influence environmental planning and decisionmaking.'' See,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Illinois Commerce Comm'n  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ICC,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 848 F.2d 1246, 1256 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (``it is not at all apparent that a change in procedure alone will not affect the environment_the new procedure may, for example, lessen the opportunity for environmental groups to influence the agency's final decision''). An environmental assessment, which examines opportunities for public involvement in APHIS' environmental process, has been prepared. The environmental assessment concludes essentially that public involvement in APHIS' environmental planning and decisionmaking is consistent with NEPA requirements. In the circumstances, a finding of no significant impact is appropriate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Copies of the environmental assessment may be obtained by writing the contact for this rulemaking provided under the section heading  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> For Further Information Contact. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments are invited and should be submitted to this same contact on or before the comment due date for this proposed rulemaking. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Paperwork Reduction Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These proposed procedures contain no information collection or recordkeeping requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

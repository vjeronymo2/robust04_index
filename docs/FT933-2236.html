			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / A wait for hidden fruit: The Arab economic boycott of Israel is unlikely to be rapidly reversed The economic fruits of peace moves in the Middle East are unlikely to emerge with the drama and suddenness of Mr Yassir Arafat's appearance last week on the south lawn of the White House. As Mr James Baker, the former US secretary of state, commented after the two historic handshakes between the Palestine Liberation Organisation leader and Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister: 'This is not peace. But it makes peace more likely.' Israel has already learned from its experience with Egypt since 1979 that even a full peace treaty, with all its provisions for a full normalisation of relations, is not necessarily a precursor of closer economic links. But where Israel might realistically have grounds for optimism is that the momentum created for a wider peace in the region will further erode the long-standing Arab efforts to deny the Jewish state access to international investment and trade. The main vehicle for pursuing this policy over the past nearly half-century has been the Arab boycott, intended initially to check Jewish political aspirations in Palestine and later formalised by the League of Arab States. Its purpose has been twofold. First, to isolate Israel economically within the region and then, more controversially, to persuade non-Arab countries and companies not to do business with Israel. The persuasion came in the form of threats, administered from the Arab League boycott office in Damascus, the Syrian capital. It drew up and maintains a blacklist of companies which, theoretically, are barred from doing business in the Arab world because of their connections with Israel. Companies seeking to operate in Arab countries are supposed to certify that they have no dealings with Israel. How effective these restrictions have been is a matter of debate. Plainly, the boycott has not prevented Israel blooming economically. On the other hand, some Israeli officials argue that it has cost the country some Dollars 2bn-Dollars 3bn annually in lost trade and investment as companies decided not to take the risk of endangering their Arab markets, particularly those in the main oil-producing nations. Calculating the extent of the risk has long been an imprecise exercise, given the apparently haphazard operations of the Damascus office. No blacklist is published although some sources claim it contains more than 10,000 names. Companies are not informed of their status, while a few have blatantly ignored the boycott and escaped any retribution. More are now likely to follow. Diplomats from Arab states which have supported the peace process say that it is unlikely in the short-term that the weakened and divided Arab League will take a formal decision to end the boycott. Any such move, they say, would depend on far more substantial progress in the peace negotiations. However, they point out that the boycott has already been significantly weakened, and international pressure for its abrogation was already mounting before Israel and the PLO signed their declaration of principles on a negotiated settlement in Washington last week. The Group of Seven industrialised nations meeting in Tokyo this summer called for the boycott to be ended, while companies such as Coca-Cola have shown that it is possible both to defy the boycott and to be taken off the Damascus list. Kuwait, in its fury at PLO support for Iraq during the Gulf War, announced that it would no longer support the secondary aspects of the boycott. But Arab governments and businessmen can also see benefits in not rushing to bury the boycott formally. The competition for foreign investment in the Middle East is certain to intensify should it become apparent that the peace process is irreversible. Many billions of dollars will be required to underpin the fragile political evolution in the occupied territories. Lebanon is seeking similar sums to rebuild its infrastructure, while Jordan and eventually Syria will be no less anxious to attract capital and develop trade. Israel and its smaller Arab neighbours have all studied Singapore's achievement in becoming the banking, services, transport and technological hub of a wider region. Mr Rafiq al-Hariri, the most entrepreneurial prime minister in the Middle East, has no doubt that Lebanon's future lies in capitalising regionally on any similar opportunities that are offered by peace. He and others are also well aware that Israel's relative sophistication gives it a massive initial advantage. So while the Arab boycott will be increasingly ignored by the international business community, the informal economic fences around Israel will take much longer to dismantle.</p>

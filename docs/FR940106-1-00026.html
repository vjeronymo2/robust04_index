			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Proposed Revisions to the Termination of Entitlement and to the Resumption of Entitlement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 226A(c)(2) and (c)(3) of the Act specifies the conditions for beginning a new period of entitlement when a kidney transplant fails or a regular course of dialysis begins again. However, this section refers to those instances when entitlement has not yet ended and specifies that Part A entitlement ``begins'' (although it may not yet have ended) with the month when regular dialysis treatments begin again. The importance of ``beginning'' Part A entitlement is that it offers the opportunity for those who do not have Part B (Supplementary Medical Insurance) entitlement to enroll in Part B without waiting for the annual general enrollment period (January through March). Supplementary Medical Insurance is a voluntary program available to most individuals age 65 or over and to disabled individuals who are under age 65 and entitled to Medicare Part A. In addition, since Part A entitlement has not ended, we believe that the intention is to re-enroll the individual in Part A with that month, without a new application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, we propose to treat the situation where dialysis or transplant recurs during the 12-month or 36-month periods as a resumption of entitlement. Accordingly, we delete from &sect;406.13(f) the reference to continuation of entitlement, and instead revise &sect;406.13(g), which specifies the conditions for resumption of entitlement, to include this situation where coverage resumes despite a previous course of treatment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We propose to revise &sect;406.13(g) to state that entitlement would be resumed under any one of three conditions. Using the language we propose to remove from paragraph (f), a new period of entitlement would begin if an individual initiates a regular course of renal dialysis during the 12-month period after the previous course of dialysis ended, and he or she would be entitled to resume Part A benefits and eligible to enroll in Part B benefits effective with the month the regular course of dialysis is resumed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The statute does not mention the beginning of a new period of entitlement when a second kidney transplant occurs during the 36-month period following the initial transplant, since there is never a waiting period for entitlement based on a transplant. However, we believe that, by analogy, the provisions for beginning a new period of entitlement in cases where a regular course of dialysis begins or recurs during the 36 months indicate that we should construe the law as requiring resumption of entitlement and a new period of Part B enrollment in cases of re-transplantation that occur without the beneficiary's resuming (or initiating) dialysis treatments. We, therefore, propose to revise &sect;406.13(g) to state that entitlement would begin when an individual initiates a new, regular course of renal dialysis, or has a kidney transplant, during the 36-month period after an earlier kidney transplant, and that he or she would be entitled to resume Part A benefits and eligible to enroll in Part B benefits effective with the month the regular course of dialysis begins or with the month the subsequent kidney transplant occurs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We also propose to make technical revisions to &sect;406.13(g) to clarify the other condition for resumption of entitlement. That is, entitlement is resumed if an individual initiates a regular course of renal dialysis more than 12 months after the previous regular course of dialysis ended or more than 36 months after the month of a kidney transplant, and the individual is eligible to enroll in Part A and Part B benefits effective with the month in which the regular course of dialysis treatment is resumed. If he or she is otherwise entitled to Part A benefits under the conditions specified in &sect;406.13(c), and files an application, entitlement would begin with the month in which dialysis treatments are initiated or resumed, without a waiting period, subject to the basic limitations of entitlement in &sect;406.13(e)(1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Proposed Revisions' Effect on Medicare Part B  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The revised definition of ESRD in &sect;406.13(b) and revisions to resumption of entitlement in &sect;406.13(g) would also be used as the basis for eligibility for Medicare Part B. This is because, in accordance with &sect;407.10(a)(1), an individual who qualifies for Medicare Part A on the basis of ESRD is also eligible for Medicare Part B.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Manuals Affected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> When we publish these proposed requirements as a final rule, the Social Security Program Operations Manual System, Part 6, ``HI''; the Medicare Part A Intermediary Manual, Part 3, ``Claims Processing''; the Medicare Part B Carriers Manual, Part 3, ``Claims Processing''; and the Medicare Renal Dialysis Facilities Manual, would be revised to reflect the changes made to the definition of ESRD and the resumption of entitlement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Collection of Information Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule contains no information collection requirements. Consequently, this rule need not be reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under the authority of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

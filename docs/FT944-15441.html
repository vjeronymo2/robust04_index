			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Survey of Fraud - Prevention and Detection (8): Wall Street's private eye / Profile of Kroll Associates Kroll Associates, the world's leading corporate investigative agency, has not generally been shy of publicity. They have managed to present an image of a dynamic sleuthing operation, whose success has bred an impressive client list which includes governments and leading companies. However, in recent months the agency's founder and majority owner, former New York prosecutor Jules Kroll, has been on the defensive, fighting off rumours of significant internal problems and creeping financial difficulties. The suggestion of something approaching an organisational haemorrhage has been fuelled by a spate of high-level resignations and the threat of more to come. In an interview published in the New York Times early in September, Mr Kroll blamed unnamed competitors for spreading false rumours about the financial condition of his company which, in turn, had provoked a round of crisis management at Kroll itself. Most of those who have left say their reason for going was to set up their own smaller, private investigation agencies. Mr Kroll and the remaining senior executives insist that the resignations do not signify the beginning of the end. In London, Kroll's senior man, Thomas Helsby, boasts of a 'critical mass of experience' among its staff which can without difficulty absorb and overcome the temporary setback of the resignations. Not only has Kroll managed to hang on to many of its talented investigators on a full-time and freelance basis, it retains what it considers one of its biggest assets: a highly developed in-house data system. As one competitor reluctantly conceded: 'Kroll has a powerful armoury of research capability.' Mr Helsby, with characteristic bullishness, says: 'Our business is growing and growing, adding on new things all the time. This office is having the best year it has ever had.' In New York, Mr Kroll has published figures showing that his company has remained profitable with a pretax profit margin of about 12 per cent. Revenues are expected to exceed Dollars 60m this year compared to Dollars 40m in 1990, with an increase in clients over the past four years of 78 per cent. What Kroll executives are not prepared to counter with any conviction is the widely aired view held by its competitors that the agency may in one sense have fallen victim to its own success: its turnover is being badly dented by disputed debts on at least two highly publicised cases. In August, it emerged in New York that Kroll was suing the family of the late Italian banker Roberto Calvi for non-payment of Dollars 3m. Kroll, which has filed a court action in the US, hopes it will recover the money as well as recoup the legal costs it will incur. Rather more problematical is the non-payment of an even larger sum believed to stem from a contract with the Russian government. It is estimated the contract may have cost Kroll up to Dollars 4.7m. The extent of the hurt caused by the setbacks, depends on whether the company can continue to diversify. Following its formation in 1972, Kroll established itself fairly quickly as Wall Street's private eye, specialising in investigations involving mergers and acquisitions. With the recession, Kroll has cast an increasingly wide net to attract clients. It still considers due diligence reports on companies part of its core work, along with fraud investigations, but its target is to become an unrivalled international provider of planning and analysis on every aspect of security and risk management. Mr Kroll hopes to quadruple his firm's revenues by the end of the decade, building on its partnership with the US insurance company American International Group (AIG bought 23 per cent of Kroll last year).</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Newsletter: "Neighbors Are Dearer Than Distant Relatives" </F> by XINHUA reporters Ju Mengjun (0215 1322 6511) and Hu Xiaoguang  (5170 2556 0342)]    [Text] Almaty, 27 Apr (XINHUA) -- "Neighbors are dearer  than distant relatives." At a grand banquet to welcome visiting  Premier Li Peng, President Nazarbayev used this proverb to  figuratively and profoundly express aspirations of peoples of  the two countries who are willing to be friendly for generations.    Situated at the northern foot of the Ili Mountain Range,  Almaty City, with flourishing trees lining its streets, faces  snow-capped mountains in the south. The national flags of China  and Kazakhstan are fluttering in the wind along the city's major  streets. It is a city that links Sino-Kazakh friendship. Both  the ancient "Silk Road" and today's Eurasian Bridge pass through  this vintage city.    Premier Li Peng and Kazakh leaders are writing a new chapter  of Sino-Kazakh relations together with sincere words including  "good-neighborliness, friendship, and cooperation."    In the past few days, Kazakh mass media have been using nice  phrases, including "a great country" and "a friendly neighbor,"  to report on China's situation and Premier Li Peng's visit.  FIELD OF VISION PAPER [shi ye bao 6018 6851 1032] hailed  China's reform policy, claiming that "proceeding from specific  national conditions and refusing to blindly copy other country's  models" were an important experience of China's successful  reform. KAZAKHSTAN INFORMATION PAPER [xiao xi bao 3194 1873  1032] used the phrase "a new and important phase of Sino-Kazakh  cooperation" as a headline to report on Premier Li Peng's visit.    The magnificent Kazakh presidential palace was particularly  splendid under full view of the sun. However, people were more  interested in the talks between Premier Li Peng and President  Nazarbayev and in the agreements reached by both sides. Because  of their friendly relationship and the extensive topics under  discussion, the two leaders had to extend their talks one hour  longer than originally scheduled.    Many reporters had come early and had been waiting at the  agreement-signing hall. In addition to Chinese and Kazakh  reporters, many Russian reporters and colleagues from THE  ASSOCIATED PRESS, REUTERS, AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE, BRITISH  BROADCASTING CORPORATION, and Turkish newspapers were present.  A Kazakh Foreign Ministry official told the reporters: The  mass media are paying very close attention to Premier Li Peng's  visit. It is seldom that so many foreign reporters have come to  Almaty to prepare news reports.    Naturally, the most important agreement reached by both  countries was the border agreement. Around noon, Premier Li  Peng and President Nazarbayev, full of smiles, entered the  agreement-signing hall together. While cameras continuously  flashed, they raised their pens and signed the Sino-Kazakh  border agreement. Both Premier Li Peng and President Nazarbayev  spoke highly of the agreement, saying that "the signing of the  agreement has historic significance in Sino-Kazakh relations and  is an important indicator of the development of good-neighborly  and friendly relations between the two countries."    Kazakh Prime Minister Tereshchenko, who was recuperating in  Moscow, hurriedly returned to Almaty solely to welcome visiting  Premier Li Peng. With a cane in hand and together with Premier  Li Peng, he climbed up to a rostrum in the Almaty Business  Center's Conference Lounge. Several hundred Kazakh economic and  trade officials and entrepreneurs earnestly listened to Premier  Li Peng at the lounge on developing economic and trade relations  between China and Central Asia. A coal mine expert said: "We  fully agree with Premier Li Peng's speech where he stressed  mutually beneficial cooperation. The two countries share  1,700-odd km of common boundaries and have been maintaining  traditionally friendly relations. There are natural conditions,  including favorable opportunities and locales, for us to carry  out economic and trade cooperation."    During an interview with the reporters, Kazakh Ambassador to  China Auezov indicated: Premier Li Peng's visit is the first  visit by a ranking Chinese leader to Kazakhstan since its  independence. It is very important politically and  economically. A Kazakh friend likened the current Sino-Kazakh  relations to a vigorously growing tree of friendship. He said:  Under the utmost careful cultivation of leaders and peoples of  the two countries, the tree will bear abundant fruit.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yaroslav Shimov: "Belorussian Economy's Fate </F> Will Not Be Decided Before Presidential Elections"]    [Text] Minsk-Moscow -- The treaty on Russian-Belorussian  [Belarusian] monetary union officially came into force 1 May --  insofar as the creation of a single customs area on the  territory of the two states is concerned. There is still a  great deal of uncertainty over the other aspects of  Russian-Belorussian economic union.    According to a sociological poll conducted by Belorussia's  [Belarus's] "Public Opinion" service, 66 percent of the  country's inhabitants back monetary union, while 34 percent are  against or cannot make up their minds. The idea of economic  union with the powerful -- compared with Belorussia itself --  eastern neighbor is popular with a people who still have a poor  idea however of what kind of union this is and what it is like.  The main point is when, where, and at what rate of exchange  Belorussians will be able to obtain the more stable Russian  rubles instead of the rapidly devaluing "hares" (the level of  inflation in March was around 40 percent).    Even Belorussia's top leaders cannot provide a clear answer  to that question now. Supreme Soviet Chairman Mechyslaw Hryb  did not give IZVESTIYA a specific date for money exchange. So  Belorussians were fretting for nothing as they tried to get rid  of "hares" during the first few days following the signing of  the treaty with Russia. (The current rate of the Russian ruble  against the local bills of exchange is 1:8.) There is every  indication that the farewell to the "hare" will not take place  very soon: There are too many questions over monetary union and  they still have to be settled.    At an extraordinary Supreme Soviet session Belorussian  deputies made the legislative adjustments necessary to ensure  that the agreement with Russia works. But the question of the  National Bank of Belorussia which, as a result of this  agreement, is reduced to the level of a regional branch of the  Russian bank, has not been resolved: One of the articles of the  recently adopted Belorussian Constitution needs to be altered  for that. People in Minsk are not desperately keen on doing  that. Mechyslaw Hryb said that during a conversation with him  the Russian president also remarked that "it is better to work  on the text of the treaty than change the Constitution."    The Supreme Soviet chairman believes that the first stage in  the implementation of the Russian-Belorussian agreement will  make it possible to judge whether the treaty is at all workable.  Although for Mr. Hryb himself the need for economic union with  Russia remains axiomatic. "Our economic orientation is  eastward," the Belorussian speaker said. "The form that this  orientation may take is another matter...."    Meanwhile not only one-third of Belorussians polled by  sociologists, but also the opposition are prey to gnawing doubts  about the need for an economic treaty with Russia. People's  Deputy Vladimir Novik, for instance, believes that "Belorussia  will end up in complete financial isolation as a result of  monetary union and bound tight to Russia. Russian Government  strategists, rich financial corporations, and industrial groups  can then set about sharing out Belorussia's national wealth."    Mechyslaw Hryb does not however see any particular problem  in  the possibility of Russian capital's active penetration of the  Belorussian market since this will, in his opinion, "at any rate  be working for us by producing goods and giving our people  work." The latter is a particularly pressing issue for the  Republic since many of Belorussia's enterprises are on the verge  of closure.    Union with Russia, however much it means for Belorussia's  one-sided economy, can hardly be a panacea for all ills. Their  own economic reforms are also needed. Whether they will finally  be implemented and in what direction will not be decided before  23 June, the day of the presidential elections. The future of  the Belorussian economy once again rests on the outcome of  political battles.    Just six weeks remain until the election of Belorussia's  first president, but two possibilities for the future of the  Belorussian economy are now clear. If a moderate democrat or  representative of the local "power party" wins, Belorussia can  expect increasingly close rapprochement with Russia and gradual  reforms somewhat reminiscent of the course pursued by V.  Chernomyrdin's Russian Government. If a nationalist or  Communist candidate is successful that may spell the beginning  of senseless experiments, which may bring about the downfall of  this country's economy.</p>

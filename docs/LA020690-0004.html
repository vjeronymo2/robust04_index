			<p><P> February 6, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CURB ASKED ON ZOO SALE OF ANIMALS  </P> <P> Sen. Dan McCorquodale (D-San Jose) sent a letter to Mayor Maureen O'Connor  Monday urging her to forbid the San Diego Zoological Society from selling  surplus animals to any person other than another zoo.  </P> <P> The letter explicitly asked that the city of San Diego forbid the zoo from  selling animals to Earl Tatum and Jim Fouts, two animal dealers who were  featured in a recent "60 Minutes" segment that alleged they have sold zoo  animals to private game farms, where they were shot by hunters.  </P> <P> The letter also lauded Mayor Tom Bradley of Los Angeles, who last week ordered  the Los Angeles Zoo to stop doing business with Tatum and Fouts, and urged  O'Connor to "expeditiously follow suit."  </P> <P> Paul Downey, a spokesman for the mayor, said that, by close of business Monday,  O'Connor had not yet received a copy of the letter. But he said that, because  O'Connor does not have any formal authority over the zoo, there is likely  little that she can do.  </P> <P> "If I'm not mistaken, the L.A. Zoo is a city facility," Downey said. "In this  case, the zoo is not a city-run facility, so there is nothing the mayor or the  City Council can do."  </P> <P> The city of Los Angeles does run its zoo.  </P> <P> Mary Shallenberger, a consultant to the State Senate Committee on Natural  Resources and Wildlife, which McCorquodale chairs, said she understood that the  San Diego Zoo is a private institution.  </P> <P> "But I think, if the mayor of one of the largest cities in California calls on  their zoo to stop a practice, they certainly have a tremendous influence,"  Shallenberger said.  </P> <P> Downey responded, "They may not understand the system of government here. We  don't have a strong mayor-type of government."  </P> <P> Downey said that, when the mayor receives the letter, her office will forward  it to the zoo and ask them to respond. He noted, however, that last week the  San Diego Zoo announced that it had severed its ties with Fouts, although it  continues to employ Tatum.  </P> <P> "It's really a moot point," he said. "If there's any reason to look into their  response, we will."  </P></p>

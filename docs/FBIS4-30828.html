			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Lyuben Berov by Irena </F> Marinova at the Bulgarian National Assembly on 26 May: "No One  Envies Me for the Role I Perform"]    [Text] On 26 May Prime Minister Berov was constantly  besieged by TRUD reporters. The interview with him began in the  parliament at noon, when the prime minister arrived for his  meetings with the parliamentary factions, and continued, rather  indelicately, when Professor Berov was on his way to or from the  lavatory. When the prime minister heard the results of the  vote, he answered the questions of our reporter first.  <H5>  Before the Vote </H5>   [Marinova] Mr. Prime Minister, why did you decide to ask for  a vote of confidence on the basis of the government's program  until September 1994, and not on a specific matter or on the  cabinet's comprehensive policy?    [Berov] Why? The vote is on the cabinet's comprehensive  policy.    [Marinova] What do you mean? The request for a confidence  vote that was submitted today by Veselin Blagoev, chief  secretary of the Council of Ministers, stresses that it is  related to the program.    [Berov] Well, yes. This is our present comprehensive  policy. What is so strange about it?    [Marinova] It is strange because you selected precisely this  alternative, while the Constitution offers two additional  alternatives.    [Berov] I think that this is the most prudent one.    [Marinova] What are your arguments?    [Berov] Oh, come on. What arguments do you want. (laughs)  The argument is that we want to form an efficient government  that will be limited in its term of office and tasks. The  program we submitted represents the limited character of our  tasks.    [Marinova] Would you like to head a caretaker cabinet?    [Berov] Ah, this does not depend on me only. It is not the  executive power that forms a caretaker cabinet.    [Marinova] How long do you give the cabinet you head?    [Berov] You must ask the parliament.    [Marinova] Well, I am asking you, and I am interested in  your forecast.    [Berov] For the time being, we are talking about the period  until September.    [Marinova] Am I to understand that you are sure of the  confidence vote?    [Berov] I think so, although we could also not receive it.  It is up to parliament.    [Marinova] Do you refuse to resign because of an inner  conviction or because of someone's pressure, and if so, who is  this someone?    [Berov] No, this depends on me. I have said this 100 times,  and I have said it to you too. I hope you understand.    [Marinova] Nevertheless, would you resign?    [Berov] No, there is no reason for that.    [Marinova] The impression emerges that deputies and  parliamentary factions advise you to not resign.    [Berov] No, no. I say that if someone wants to foil this  government, he must admit this. I stressed "if," and I was very  clear and brief.    [Marinova] How could you explain a failure to sign the  framework agreement?    [Berov] I would explain it by the unwillingness of the  people to sign.    [Marinova] Whom do you see as the future prime minister?    [Berov] I do not determine this. If I was a king, I would  have appointed prime ministers, but I am not one.    [Marinova] What did you discuss with the Bulgarian Socialist  Party [BSP]?    [Berov] We discussed the program we submitted.    [Marinova] Did the Socialists say that they will support the  government program until September?    [Berov] No, we did not talk about this. Their parliamentary  faction must decide this.    [Marinova] But you said that you talked about the program?    [Berov] Discussing the merits of the program's elements is  one thing and the support of the parliamentary faction is  another.    [Marinova] Did you discuss structural and personnel changes  in the cabinet with the BSP?    [Berov] No, their parliamentary faction will convene in two  to three hours.    [Marinova] How could you explain the fact that a  substantial part of the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS] will  support you?    [Berov] Why do you ask me and not them? Let us see first if  this happens.    [Marinova] I am sure that you will get your vote of  confidence.    [Berov] I understand this, but I can answer your question  only after the vote.    [Marinova] Have you been disappointed only by Ivan Pushkarov  because of the double standards he demonstrated?    [Berov] Yes, deeply.    [Marinova] Who else?    [Berov] No one. Simply, this is the man with whom I talked  at the Boyana residence, and who then said "I never saw him."  (crosses himself)    [Marinova] Are you disappointed by the BSP? They also  changed their position.    [Berov] No one else said "I never saw him."  <H5>  After the Vote </H5>   [Marinova] Prof. Berov, how do you explain the support of  those 125 deputies? Did they do it because of you and your  cabinet, or because they do not want to part with their  parliamentary seats, since they know that they have no chance in  the next parliament?    [Berov] I do not know. You must ask them.    [Marinova] (The time is 2010, and the first to greet the  prime minister is Ahmed Dogan, leader of the Movement for Rights  and Freedoms -- DPS). Are you sure that Mr. Ahmed Dogan was  sincere in his greetings?    [Berov] I do not know. You must ask him.    [Marinova] Which politician do you think will be sincere in  his greetings?    [Berov] I do not know. So far he was the only one to greet  me. If you were the second I could say eventually that you were  more sincere.    [Marinova] Could you repeat today the words of the ancient  military leader "veni, vidi, vici" [I came, I saw, I conquered]?    [Berov] No. First of all I am not an ancient military  leader. I even think that no one envies me for this role that I  was entrusted with.    [Marinova] Do you not feel yourself to be a winner?    [Berov] No. It is not important how a man feels who has  been entrusted with the task to steer the vessel out of the  waves.    [Marinova] On whom do you rely?    [Berov] I do not rely on anything.    [Marinova] Were you ready to resign?    [Berov] Of course. If parliament would have voted  negatively.    [Marinova] Will you make personnel changes in the cabinet?  Should we expect structural changes?    [Berov] There are at least certain minimal changes that must  be effected. Then there is a person who resigned.    [Marinova] Will the resignation of [Deputy Prime Minister]  Karabashev be the only change?    [Berov] No. [Justice Minister] Kornazhev must also go.  Actually, he has already been replaced. Thus, at least two  people must go, and perhaps even more.    [Marinova] Will the agreement on the foreign debt save the  cabinet?    [Berov] No. I even think that this is not the most crucial  factor. (Turns to the journalists around him) Do not push!    [Marinova] If not the agreement on the foreign debt, then  what saved you this time?    [Berov] I cannot tell you, because I do not know who voted  for me.    [Marinova] I am asking you about the reasons, not about the  personalities.    [Berov] I cannot answer this.    [Marinova] Thank you, Prof. Berov.</p>

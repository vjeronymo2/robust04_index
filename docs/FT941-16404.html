			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Well-treated Dutch reluctant to face healthcare cost: Insurance reform plans have made little headway over the years Late last year Dutch television viewers were treated to a stark view of the choices which may confront the country's much-praised healthcare system. A studio audience was presented with the medical histories of two patients seated on stage. The audience then had to decide which case should receive funding from the healthcare system's finite financial resources. One programme featured Mrs Carmen de Bruijn, a 29-year-old mother seeking a breast reduction operation to alleviate back pain. She was pitted against Mr Kees Brink and his wife Ms Pauline Linthorst, who had elected to be sterilised during her previous marriage but now wanted to have children. The studio audience voted 25-to-20 in favour of the Fl 7,100 (Pounds 2,400) breast reduction operation and against a Fl 4,200 in-vitro-fertilisation attempt for the childless couple. The series, entitled 'A Matter of Life and Death', came under fierce criticism. Yet the programme, partially funded by the ministry of health, met its goal of stimulating public discussion about the costs of healthcare. Last week, the Dutch government launched two fresh proposals aimed at making people more cost-conscious. Proposed legislation would allow people covered by the national health system to opt for an 'own-risk deductible' that would lower their monthly premium charges. Premiums would also fall for any patient not filing claims in any given year. Finally, patients would be able to volunteer to pay all their medical bills and later be reimbursed by the national health system. These options are already available to people who are privately insured. At the moment, patients insured under the national health never actually see a bill, and they therefore have barely any idea of what health care costs, says the health ministry. The Netherlands has been confronting the prospects of wide-ranging health insurance reforms for nearly 10 years, though little has been achieved so far because of continuing political controversy. With a national election in May little progress is expected over the next few months. The momentum for reform also slowed because Mr Hans Simons, the secretary of state for health and the main proponent of reform, plans to leave national politics to seek office at the local level. The Dutch health insurance system has three tiers, but only one level of care. People earning less than Fl 56,000 a year receive compulsory coverage from a network of regional, semi-public, non-profit health insurers. Higher earners are free to take out private health schemes from a range of competitors. And the government takes care of long-term treatment for the chronically ill or the mentally handicapped through Exceptional Medical Expenses Insurance (AWBZ), which is paid out of taxes. More than 60 per cent of the population is covered by the compulsory scheme, with nearly 30 per cent covered by private-sector companies. While there are few complaints about the quality of care in the Netherlands  -hospitals are well-funded and alternative therapies are often covered by insurers - the government believes that there should be more competition between insurers. It wants to merge the three separate types of financial flows into one system, so that healthcare choices are more efficient and cost-effective. 'Under the present system, insurers sometimes prefer to see people stay in residential, nursing-home care because this is paid for by the government. This is true even when home help would be better and cheaper,' a health ministry spokesman said. Debate about the funding of health care began in 1986, when Mr Wisse Dekker, a former board chairman of the Philips electronics group, was asked to review the system. A year later, the Dekker Committee proposed that everyone be covered by one basic health insurance package, ending the split between public and private schemes. More controversially, the proposed basic package would cover only 70-80 per cent of the existing, all-inclusive package. Although details were never worked out, people wanting to insure themselves against the cost of physiotherapy, for example, might have to take out supplementary insurance. Mr Simons, a Labour politician, rejected some of the measures, urging that the basic health package should be as comprehensive as possible, avoiding the need for supplementary coverage. In contrast to the Dekker plan, which called for half of total insurance premiums to be linked to individual salaries, Mr Simons wanted 80 per cent to be determined by earnings, putting a greater burden on the better paid. In the end, Mr Simons has had only partial success in his attempt to take the AWBZ fund and turn it into a forerunner of a single form of national health insurance. Rehabilitation treatment and medicines have been transferred to the AWBZ, but more basic coverage - hospitals, general practitioners and specialists - still remains in the two-tier, public-private system. As long as this is the case, the Netherlands is far removed from the goal of creating one 'pot' of healthcare money from the various 'little pots' characterising the system.

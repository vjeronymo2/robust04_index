"I hope to see my team  play the same way."  </P> <P> Sophomore Jim Toring scored five goals, three in the third period, and Mark  Townsend and Ryan Salceda each scored three goals for Harvard (2-0). Brian  Border and Matt DeFronzo each scored twice.  </P> <P> "We are starting to come together as a team," Harvard Coach Rich Corso said.  "The chemistry is already there and the kids are feeling good."  </P> <P> Harvard will play Anaheim Canyon in the second round today at 1:30 p.m. at  Wilson High. ADAM BENSON  </P></p>

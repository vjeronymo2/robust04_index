			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Blessed are the bleach makers Paint-makers, specialist chemical companies and even manufacturers of household bleach will have to comply with a standard labelling system if they want to sell their products in the single European market. To help product formulators label their products correctly Safeware Systems of Kegworth has developed a PC software package which identifies the correct risk label to put on the product - there are about 100 of them. The package also helps formulators decide which ingredients to swap in order to change the hazard levels. Diluting many chemicals can reduce the danger factor, for example. The package could also reduce the need for animal testing. Safeware Systems: UK, 0509 672656.</p>

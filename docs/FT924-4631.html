			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: New advance led by the dollar stocks CONFIDENCE in prospects for economic recovery remained high in the London stock market yesterday, and the FT-SE Index closed at new trading and closing highs in spite of a slow opening to the first effective session on Wall Street since the Thanksgiving holiday weekend. The first day of the new two-week equity trading account saw the UK market rise by 24 points in early trading to touch a new trading peak of 2,784.1, as investors bought dollar stocks. When New York opened with a gain of only 3.78 Dow points in UK hours, London stocks eased back from the day's highest levels. The final reading of 2,778.8 showed a gain of 18.7 on the FT-SE Index. Domestic news played a minor role yesterday. Suspension of Rosehaugh, a leading property development group, as official receivers were called in, restrained some other property stocks as well as those UK banks known to be exposed in the property sector. Fears that the economic recession could still deliver severe shocks to confidence continue to restrain investment confidence, according to strategists at several leading securities firms. However, there was a firm response to the statistics on November UK money supply showing a provisional gain of 0.8 per cent. Inflationary worries have been put aside, at least for the time being. From the opening, attention focused on the prospects for a further rise on Wall Street as it made a fuller response to last week's favourable data on gross domestic product and durable goods order trends. Once again, a strong performance from the December future contract on the Footsie, which moved briefly above 2,800 yesterday, provided the lead for the underlying equity market. Futures buying is often an indication that institutions are preparing to move into equities. Share buyers remained selective, buying Wellcome but not Glaxo and RTZ but not SmithKline Beecham. Second line issues were very active, the total shares traded in non-Footsie listed stocks exceeding those of the Footsie giants. The day's Seaq volume total of 635m shares compared with 665.9m on Friday, when retail business of Pounds 1.19bn maintained the record of significantly improved business levels since the mid-September. The London market is now waiting to see the list of important economic data on the US economy which is due today; the leading economic indicators, National Association of Purchasing Managers survey, and construction spending statistics will all be scanned eagerly for further signs of an upturn in the US economy. Tomorrow's auction of British government bonds was also believed to be a restraining factor on institutional activity in the equity market yesterday. Among the domestically-orientated sectors, breweries attracted buyers ahead of a week which will bring trading reports from a number of the industry leaders. Store and retail issues, hoping now that the all-important Christmas selling season, which provides a substantial portion of profits for the leading store groups, will disclose some recovery in retail activity, found buyers. Firmness in sterling, regarded as a necessary prop for the further reduction of one point in UK base rates expected before the end of January, also helped sentiment.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 5 May (MENA)--President Husni Mubarak has  issued another appeal to the Yemeni leaders to end the fighting.  He warned of the grave consequences of the spreading  confrontation between the armed forces in northern and southern  Yemen and said that the situation is ominous and has been so  since the start of the current crisis.    In his appeal, the president said: Wishing to avoid an armed  confrontation among the sons of the Yemeni people, I called upon  you repeatedly to exercise self-restraint, resort to reason, and  seek understanding and reconciliation through dialogue. With  this same motive, Egyptian mediation was and still is active.  I have repeatedly warned of the dangers involved in a clash  that would be difficult to contain.    President Mubarak said: I call on Yemeni President 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih to use the powers of his office in making the  decisions necessary to end the current fighting in the country,  separate the troops, and deflect the imminent danger the current  strife portends for all Yemenis.    In his appeal, President Mubarak said that a decision to  halt  all military operations on both sides and separate the troops  will thwart the designs of those who conspire against the sons  of the Yemeni people and their unity and give dialogue, reason,  and logic a chance to prevail.    President Mubarak added: I trust that President 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih will side with the interests of the Yemeni  people and stop the fighting before it turns into a full-fledged  civil war that would engulf Yemen in great dangers and whose  complications will be hard to control or reverse. President  Mubarak said that everyone would place Yemeni interests above  all considerations.</p>

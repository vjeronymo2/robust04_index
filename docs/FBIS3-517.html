In a statement he accused minister of Foreign  Affairs Pik Botha and South Africa's ambassador to  Bophuthatswana, Tjaart van der Walt, of flagrant interference in  the homeland's internal affairs.    Mr van der Walt, "State President F W de Klerk's personal  destabilising agent", should be recalled, Mr Langley said.    In an apparent reference to the Bophuthatswana cabinet  decision to boycott the April elections, Mr Langley said: "Any  action to promote unrest in Bophuthatswana is blackmail from the  textbook of Messrs de Klerk, Botha and his boss, ANC President  Nelson Mandela."    Problems in Bophuthatswana were deliberately being  exaggerated by SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation]  television news and the media in an attempt to stimulate  pressure from outside, Mr Langley claimed. Mr Botha's  "gossiping" about the state on television and in the media was  an attempt to "give body" to the destabilisation, he said.    "Mr Botha and the NP government have made a total mess of  South Africa. He is now helping South Africa to become  Azania...and yearns to do the same with Bophuthatswana."</p>

			<p><P> July 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BANKER TELLS OF RADIN REJECTING EVANS' BID ON 'COTTON CLUB' PARTNER  </P> <P> In a stormy meeting in the weeks before he was killed in 1983, theatrical  entrepreneur Roy Radin turned down efforts by Hollywood producer Robert Evans  to allow Elayne (Lanie) Greenberger, a reputed drug dealer, into their  film-making partnership, a banker testified Wednesday.  </P> <P> Prosecutors have charged Greenberger and three other defendants with the 1983  murder of Radin because he would not cut her in on the $35-million film  production company deal that he had made with Evans.  </P> <P> Jose Alegria, the Puerto Rican banker who drew up the contract between Evans  and Radin, testified Wednesday that during the April, 1983, meeting in Evans'  Manhattan townhouse, Radin and Greenberger argued over her share of the film  company.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Completion Bond  </P> <P> Greenberger broke down and wept, Alegria testified during the ongoing hearing  into Radin's death, because Radin would not recognize her role in introducing  him to Evans. Although Evans wanted Greenberger as a partner, Radin adamantly  refused, Alegria said.  </P> <P> Radin and Evans had also fought bitterly, "almost every day," according to  Alegria, although they usually ended up hugging each other. Alegria said he was  holding out on completing the deal until Evans came up with a completion bond  for "Cotton Club" to guarantee that the film would get made.  </P> <P> On the evening of May 13, 1983, Radin and Greenberger entered a limousine  outside the Hollywood Regency hotel and drove off to a planned dinner meeting  at La Scala restaurant in Beverly Hills. Radin had told associates that he and  Greenberger, later identified by homicide investigators as alleged cocaine  dealer Lanie Jacobs, were going to patch up their differences.  </P> <P> Radin never made it to dinner. His body was found four weeks later in a  deserted canyon near Gorman. Prosecutors believe that Greenberger hired three  former security guards who worked for Hustler publisher Larry Flynt to execute  Radin.  </P> <P> Although he has not been charged, Evans has not been ruled out as a suspect by  the district attorney's office. The 59-year-old producer has refused to testify  in the hearing on grounds that he could incriminate himself.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Shot to Death  </P> <P> The month before Radin was shot to death, he and Evans planned to turn the  movie "Cotton Club" into a three-film deal that could eventually reap $150  million in profits, according to Alegria.  </P> <P> Their first film was to have been "Cotton Club," which was budgeted at $26  million when the two men signed an agreement with Alegria in April, 1983. The  film eventually ended up $20 million over budget.  </P></p>

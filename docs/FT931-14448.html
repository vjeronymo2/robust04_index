			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / HK legislators voice fears on China talks A GROUP of conservative Hong Kong legislators will today tell British government leaders of their deep concern at the way Sino-British relations have been deteriorating as the result of proposals for greater democracy in the colony. The legislators, members of the 17-strong Co-operative Resources Centre, are expected to tell Mr John Major, UK prime minister, and Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, that they would like to see a return to the policy of 'convergence' in relations between Britain and China. Mrs Selina Chow and Mr Howard Young said yesterday their main aim was to see a resumption of the dialogue between Britain and China, which would ensure a smooth transition to the hand-over of sovereignty in 1997. They were not asking for withdrawal by Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong governor, of his electoral reform package, the main cause of the trouble, but they would like him to amend it. 'If the British government took the initiative to amend the proposals, that might be the key to the reopening of the dialogue with China,' Mr Young said. The Hong Kong people, caught in the middle of the Anglo-Chinese quarrel, did not relish the prospect of 'four-and-a-half years of needless arguments' at their expense. 'At the end of the day, it is the Hong Kong people who have to live with the consequences,' Mrs Chow said. The legislators said that, while they thought Mr Patten had acted with the best intentions, they believed 'he might not be getting the best advice'. The western form of adversarial politics was not necessarily the best way to handle the Chinese. 'To get more, you have to use persuasion,' Mrs Chow said. Flexibility wins friends, Page 16</p>

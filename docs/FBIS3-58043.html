			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Owen Bowcott: "PM Urged To Clarify Peace </F> Document"]    [Text] Belfast -- Kevin Macnamara, the Labour spokesman on  Northern Ireland, yesterday added his support to the growing  number of calls for clarification of the Downing Street  declaration.    His intervention came as the Sinn Fein president, Gerry  Adams, indicated that he would be writing to the Prime Minister  in the coming days to seek an explanation of "key issues" in the  document.    In Belfast, more optimistic expressions have emerged from  republicans who are considering the declaration. At a meeting  of the city council this week, a Sinn Fein councillor, Martin  O'Mulleoir, said that he believed the peace process could  succeed. "We are hopeful that if properly managed a process to  bring about a lasting peace, a permanent peace, can be  established," he said.    Direct dialogue with both the British and Irish governments  would help clarify the numerous ambiguities in the document, he  added.    Mr Macnamara's call for such a process of clarification  followed a statement on Tuesday [4 January] from John Hume MP,  the leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party, in which  he suggested that the peace process would be aided by Downing  Street offering to discuss the issues.    Yesterday the Labour spokesman said he would be surprised if  the Government was not already involved in exchanges with  republicans via the secret channels of communications revealed  last year.    "The British and Irish governments should provide  clarification of the Downing Street declaration if it's helpful  in the quest for peace," he said yesterday during an interview  on BBC Radio Ulster. He added: "But what is important is that  clarification should not become negotiation."    Mr Adams, who welcomed John Hume's plea for further  contacts,  yesterday accused the Government of "hypocrisy and cynicism."  John Major, he said, "cannot complain about the caution with  which Sinn Fein has approached the contradictions of the  declaration if he refuses the very reasonable request to have  these matters clarified.    "There is a growing belief that the British Government do  not  want a positive response from republicans to this declaration  but that they are seeking a public justification for a renewed  onslaught on Irish nationalists. I will be writing to Mr Major  in the next few days about these issues."    Nigel Dodds, a Democratic Unionist Party councillor in  Belfast, has in the meantime challenged the Prime Minister to  reveal whether or not he is involved in secret discussions with  Sinn Fein.    In Dublin, the government is still considering whether or  not  to let the broadcasting ban imposed on Sinn Fein lapse later  thus month. Some cabinet members believe that removing the  long-standing restrictions would encourage the republican  movement to take part in normal constitutional politics.</p>

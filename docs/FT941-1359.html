			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Observer: Tank battle Heard the one about the fish which drowned? It happened the other day at Grimsby's National Fishing Heritage Centre when a 75-year-old lobster, called Claws, fell out with the Codfather, the museum's prize cod. Although the cod lost half its tail, the official autopsy showed that the cod turned up its fins because it had been drowned by Claws. The council-owned fish tank, visited by over 160,000 people a year, intends to keep the Codfather's replacement in a separate tank from Claws in a bid to maintain a durable cod peace . . .</p>

			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / International Company News: Wessanen sees 12% advance WESSANEN, the Dutch food producer, posted a provisional rise of more than 12 per cent in profit from normal business operations in 1992, and predicted a further rise in per-share results in the year ahead, writes Ronald van de Krol. The company, which reports final figures on March 4, said 1992 net profit before extraordinary items showed a rise of more than 12 per cent from the Fl 109.9m (Dollars 60.0m) reported in 1991. The profit figure would have been Fl 4m higher if it had not been for the fall in the dollar. Per-share results before extraordinaries rose by nearly 9 per cent from Fl 6.47 in 1991, and Wessanen forecast a further, unspecified rise in 1993.</p>

			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar on brink of all-time low THE DOLLAR fell to within a pfennig of its historic low against the D-Mark yesterday, in spite of a decline in short term rates in the German money market, writes James Blitz. The Bundesbank eased pressure on both the dollar and high-yielding European currencies by adding a generous amount of liquidity in its weekly money market intervention. The addition of a net DM4.2bn softened call money rates to around 9.70 per cent after they had touched the Lombard rate level of 9.75 per cent. Dealers believe there is no technical excuse for the Bundesbank council to raise the Lombard rate when it meets today. The German operation did not lift the dollar for long, however. After rallying to DM1.4605 in Europe, it weakened to DM1.4520, less than a pfennig above the all-time low of DM1.4430 set in February 1991. The US currency finished in Europe at DM1.4530 (against a previous DM1.4580). In New York it ended at DM1.4534. There is a growing belief that the Federal Reserve will let the dollar fall below the historic low before it intervenes again. Mr Mark Austin, chief economist at HongKong &amp; Shanghai Banking in London, said intervention can only work when the market is surprised. 'The Fed will intervene when it is sure that the market is not expecting it to do so.' There is lingering uncertainty over how much the Bundesbank is prepared to help. Yesterday's intervention will make it more difficult for the German central bank to sell D-Marks in the open market. A measure of the Bundesbank's capacity will be the July M3 money supply figure, due out today or tomorrow. The D-Mark's strength against the dollar was enhanced by the Bank of Portugal's 1 percentage point cut in its intervention rate to 16 per cent. Instead of heading for the escudo's high-yielding counterparts, the lira and peseta, investors opted for the D-Mark as a safe haven. The escudo dived in early European trading, ending at Es86.90 to the D-Mark from a previous Es85.84. The Portuguese currency also lost its lead in the EMS grid, slipping to third place behind the Spanish peseta and Belgian franc. Sterling looked increasingly weak at the foot of the grid, closing unchanged at DM2.8125 but widening the divergence from its central rate against the Ecu to 73 percentage points. Some dealers say that EMS central banks have a 'moral obligation' to support their currencies in open intervention when the divergence reaches 75 percentage points - although this is not a fixed rule. If the dollar goes through its all-time low, the pound could and Bank of England intervention will become a pressing issue.</p>

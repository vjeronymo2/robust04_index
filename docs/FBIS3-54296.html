During his stay, President Niyazov  visited Esfahan, [name indistinct], Shiraz, and [name  indistinct] island and became closely acquainted with Iran's  economic opportunities and issues. Undoubtedly, the two  countries' economic approach and resources can improve economic  exchanges and cooperation between them.    The signing of some 20 cooperation agreements between Iran  and Turkmenistan is very important for their bilateral  relations. With these agreements we will try to quickly remove  the effects of the 70-year long separation. In view of this,  the protocol the two countries signed on cooperation in the  supply of oil and natural gas, the establishment of sea and air  links, and exchanges of agricultural products, commodities, and  visitors is an important document.    The fact that Iran and Turkmenistan share a common border  gives us an opportunity to intensify our economic and cultural  interaction. The common historic and cultural ties between the  two sides may further promote their relations.    Meanwhile, Iran is a bridge between Turkmenistan and the  other republics in Central Asia and with the Persian Gulf and  the Indian Ocean. Considering the efforts of several Western  countries following the USSR's collapse to impose their economic  policies on the republics of Central Asia, including  Turkmenistan, the improvement of those republics' relations with  the regional countries, particularly the Islamic Republic of  Iran, will be in their interest, for it will result in closer  economic relations in which expansionist objectives have no  place.    Turkmenistan has rich oil and natural gas resources. In view  of that, it could have a special place among the republics in  Central Asia. As for culture, Turkmenistan has been separated  from its cultural roots as an Islamic country for more than 70  years but it has prepared the necessary conditions to return to  its true nature and foundations. The establishment of a network  of cultural relations and channels between Iran and Turkmenistan  will be one of the first steps the two countries will take in  the future.    The protocol between the two countries also calls for  exchanges of students and experts, the establishment of  libraries, book fairs, and cultural contacts, all of which  indicates that Tehran and Ashgabat are determined to strengthen  their relations.    It must be recalled that Turkmenistan became a member of the  Economic Cooperation Organization [ECO] and other bodies  established by the littoral countries in the Caspian Sea region  after the USSR collapsed. As stressed by the members of those  organizations, participation in their activities, particularly  in economic activities, is very important. Turkmenistan's  opportunity to export its natural gas to foreign countries  through Iran will play an important role in its effort to  improve its economy. Meanwhile, the linking of Turkmenistan's  railway system with those of Iran will enable that republic to  reach Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Turkey; and that will give it  an opportunity to reach the regional and international markets.  Undoubtedly, the establishment of links with the region and the  other parts of the world will not only serve Turkmenistan's own  interests but also promote cooperation for economic development  among the regional countries.</p>

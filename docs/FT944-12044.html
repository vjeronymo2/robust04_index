			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Credit cards go awooing - A look at an increasingly cut-throat UK market Must have a good credit rating, yet be sufficiently relaxed to spend regularly without wanting to pay off the bill each month. It may sound like a mercenary 'lonely hearts' advertisement, but the line neatly sums up the qualities that all credit card issuers are looking for these days. Despite the Pounds 10-Pounds 12 annual fee most of their profit comes from the annual percentage rate charged on outstanding bills. Their common aim notwithstanding, players in this increasingly cut-throat business have adopted a diverse range of marketing strategies over the last year. An important catalyst was the launch of the GM card from Vauxhall last October, followed by the entry of other surprising issuers, such as newspapers. No one expects the contest for customers to do anything but intensify. GM stepped up the competition for credit card customers - who splashed out almost Pounds 26bn in the first nine months of this year - by offering an annualised percentage rate (APR) of interest below that charged by the largest issuers, no annual fee, and points towards a discount on buying a Vauxhall car. One year later, there are about 450,000 GM cards in circulation. Save &amp; Prosper, the investment house, has found that a combination of advertising and close targeting pays off. The card is available only to UK home owners, and its main selling point is an APR among the lowest on offer. Mark Christopher, S&amp;P marketing manager, admits the strategy cuts across conventional wisdom, but says press advertising gives a better cost per inquiry than direct mailing - or did when the latter was last tried in 1990. Advertising's effectiveness may lie in the fact that S&amp;P is content to have built up gradually to its current 200,000 or so cards issued jointly with Robert Fleming. A further factor is that it is aiming to attract a relatively narrow group of people who know they intend to borrow and so are 'rate sensitive': for others the existence of an annual fee is more of a deterrent, since they pay off the bill in time to avoid interest charges. The marketing campaign for the GM card, by contrast, has been intended to win market share more quickly and more broadly for a brand previously unfamiliar to the UK market. Emma Serednyj, marketing manager for the GM card, says the campaign has been based on an integrated approach, involving television and press advertising, posters and direct mail shots with the aim of ensuring that someone who receives a letter would already be aware of the card and have some idea of what it offered. For cards issued by the main clearing banks and some building societies the marketing challenges are different. The aim may be simply to reach the customer with whom the organisation already has another - probably more important - relationship. At Halifax Building Society, for example, credit cards are outside the core business of savings and mortgages, but part of offering a full range of financial services. John Walsh, assistant general manager of banking at Halifax, says there is therefore little point in television or press advertising, and much more to be gained from targeting the society's 12m customers. Although Halifax is one of only two issuers to offer interest on credit balances, Walsh sees such peripheral benefits as little used and admits it can be difficult to differentiate credit cards. 'There is a great deal of inertia (among customers in personal financial services), and so we want to be first to offer the service,' he says. For Barclaycard, which with 8.8m cards has the largest share of the 27m card UK credit card market, the issue has been different again. While it is part of the Barclays group, as a credit card operation it wants to emphasise its availability to customers of other banks as well. Its most striking marketing strategy this year, however, has been its offer of rebates of up to Pounds 150 to credit card holders transferring outstanding debts from other cards. This tactic - typically used by small issuers trying to break into the market - is a further sign of the increasing competition. Shaun Powell, Barclaycard's commercial director, believes that this will see the market split into two types of card: the 'vanilla' product with no annual fee and a low APR but no extra benefits; and cards that have higher costs but are marketed on the basis of 'added value' - including insurance, a range of discounts, and the opportunity to benefit good causes and even political parties. However desperately card issuers seek the ideal customer, it seems the need to develop and market a card offering everything for nothing indefinitely is still a long way away.</p>

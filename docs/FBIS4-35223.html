			<p>BFN     [Text] Shots were fired last night on the Jewish  settlement of Kfar Darom in the center of the Gaza Strip. The  gunfire came from a group of cars with Palestinian license  plates which were traveling on the main road toward Khan Yunus.  Kfar Darom residents returned the fire. No one was hurt on  either side. The joint Israeli-Palestinian patrol arrived on  the scene to investigate the incident.    In the territories last night, a Molotov cocktail was thrown  at an Israeli bus near the settlement of Shavey Shomron. The  bomb exploded on the road, no one was hurt.    The Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] terrorist  organization has announced it intends to form a political party  in the territories, but at the same time the Hamas spokesman,  speaking in Amman, denied that a representative of the  organization, Sa'id Balal, has agreed to become a member of the  Palestinian National Authority. If Balal has chosen to take  part in the authority, said the spokesman, it was on his own  initiative, not as a representative of Hamas.    The Palestinian police chief in Gaza, Nasr Yusuf, has called  on Hamas members to stop their killing attacks and hand over  their weapons. In a leaflet distributed in Gaza, the police  also asked Hamas to turn in the people responsible for killing  two Palestinians suspected of cooperating with Israel.    In other developments, about half the Fatah Hawks police  recruits have quit, claiming there were informers among the  conscripts. And last night some 260 Palestinian policemen  entered Gaza from Egypt.</p>

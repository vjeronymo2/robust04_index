			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by parliamentary correspondent Gid'on Alon and ITIM] </F>   [Excerpts] In reaction to the Israel-PLO accord signed in  Cairo, representatives of all the opposition factions yesterday  decided to submit a bill to disband the Knesset and hold new  elections within 100 days. [passage omitted]    Some time before the Israeli-PLO signing ceremony in Cairo,  opposition faction leaders held a special news conference, at  which they sharply attacked the government. Knesset Member [MK]  Binyamin Netanyahu, chairman of the Likud, said this was a dark  day for the state and one of the lowest points in the history of  Zionism. "In an hour, Rabin will be able to declare that he has  founded the Palestinian terrorist state in Cairo," Netanyahu  said. He maintained that the government has kept none of the  pledges it had made on the eve of the Knesset elections: not to  negotiate with the PLO and not to permit the establishment of a  Palestinian state. He stressed that this government did not have  a popular majority, just as it did not have a mandate to give up  the Golan Heights. According to him, the government was carried  by a tiny majority of PLO supporters in the Knesset, and during  its term in office, the citizens' personal safety had suffered  unprecedented deterioration.    Netanyahu noted that it was the opinion of IDF [Israel  Defense Forces] elements that rather than decline, the scope of  terrorist activities would rise in the near future. He added  that terrorist organizations might mutually agree to carry out  attacks in new locations, and that their Gaza and Jericho squads  might carry out attacks on Israeli territory.    The Likud chairman stressed that the opposition factions had  decided to launch an extensive public campaign against the  creeping withdrawal and against the terrorist state's expansion  up to the outskirts of Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. "We want to  prevent this cancer from spreading and to put an end to this  inept government's fraudulence. We plan to stage demonstrations  and protest vigils, and to obtain the signatures of 500,000  citizens in support of the call for early elections," Netanyahu  said. He voiced his confidence that the opposition factions'  public struggle would be crowned with success, thereby  relegating the present government into history as a passing  episode; and that idea of a Palestinian state would fail,  because the government was incapable of uprooting 120,000  Israeli settlers in Judaea and Samaria. [passage omitted]    Later in the day, opposition leaders reacted to the ceremony  at which the Israel-PLO accord was signed.    Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu said that "Rabin's series  of concessions ended at a public degradation ceremony. Suffice  it to see with whom Rabin signed the agreement to understand the  nature of the agreement and the nature of the government that  signed it."    MK Refa'el Eytan, the Tzomet chairman, said: "In Cairo,  Rabin signed orders launching Israel's second war of  independence, a war sure to be ferocious. The faltering that  accompanied the signing proves that the unknown far exceeds the  known. If the agreement is not stopped in time, it will lead to  a Palestinian state whose final goal is the annihilation of the  State of Israel." MK Eytan added that like the other opposition  factions, Tzomet demands that the Knesset be dispersed and new  elections held within 100 days.    MK Zvulun Hammer, the National Religious Party leader, said:  "The prospects offered by this agreement are not on par with the  vast risk that national security will be endangered and with the  damage caused by a profound national rift." He asserted that a  Palestinian state was being served on a platter to the same  terrorist organizations that made merry with the blood of our  sons and daughters, while a majority of the nation are hurting  and sorrowful, apprehensive and distrustful, feeling completely  insecure and unsafe as a result of the blurred facts and vague  reality painted by the government.    Commenting on the agreement, MK Rehav'am Ze'evi, chairman of  the Moledet movement, said: "Acting as if we were the ones who  lost wars, the Israeli prime minister today signed the writ of  surrender to the head of the PLO gang. This day will be  remembered in our national history as a dark day, a landmark on  the Jewish state's way to perdition and voluntary suicide. Yet  we have not lost hope, and we will be again lords of this land  when this government of coercion and annihilation is defunct and  we become a free nation in our own country."    "This is a dark day, a day of humiliating surrender to our  enemies and murderers, a day on which a mistake for which we  will have to pay with blood was made," former Prime Minister  Yitzhaq Shamir said yesterday afternoon. "What they did today  is worthless, without any value; it wastes time and strengthens  our enemies, whom we could have defeated by now," MK Shamir  added.</p>

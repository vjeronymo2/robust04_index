			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC to place cap on imports of east European live calves THE EC is today expected to place limits on the import of live calves from eastern Europe, mainly Poland, in response to the Community's growing beef crisis. The move will add to the disgruntlement of the post-communist democracies of the east, whose leaders have accused the EC of blocking access to those goods in which they have a comparative advantage. The 227,000 head quota for live calves coming in under the normal import levy - 93 per cent taken up by Poland, with the rest from Czechoslovakia - has already been filled, a European Commission official said. No more would be allowed in under this regime, under a safeguard clause devised by the Council of EC agriculture ministers last month. But the EC will allow in an 198,000 head quota agreed at the same time, with a levy reduced by two thirds from the normal Ecu124 per 100 kilos. Most of these will also be from Poland. Fattened cattle can also still come in - 'calves' are regarded as under 220 kilos in weight and are imported for fattening within the EC. The Commission points out that this regime was started to bridge a domestic deficit, which has now turned into an expensive surplus. The stockpile of unwanted beef has reached 750,000 tonnes, and big producers like Ireland are already talking of having to store meat in refrigerated ships. Mr Ray MacSharry, EC agriculture commissioner, said on Monday that if no action is taken to bring supply into balance with demand, the beef mountain would reach 1m tonnes this time next year - well over its 1987 peak - in spite of signed contracts to export 335,000 tonnes from the existing stockpile. Beef producers attribute the Community's oversupply to eastern Germany's incorporation into the EC, which had as one effect the slaughter of 380,000 milk cows (and perhaps 250,000 more this year) to adjust to the Community's milk quota system. They also blame the loss of lucrative markets in the Middle East because of the Gulf crisis, and anxiety over 'mad cow' disease, bovine spongiform encephalopathy.</p>

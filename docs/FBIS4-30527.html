			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 28 (KCNA) -- The South Korean  opposition Democratic Party at a general meeting of assemblymen  on June 25 contended that the strike of the railway and subway  workers was attributable to the anachronistic labour policy of  the authorities and their ruthless invocation of "government"  power, a Seoul-based radio report said.    In a resolution it urged an immediate release of the workers  whisked away and a halt to the invocation of "government" power  against the strike.    The resolution said the authorities must solve the problem  through dialogue with railway and subway trade unions.</p>

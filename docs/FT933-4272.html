			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / International Company News: Bad weather hits turnover at Grolsch CHANGING weather patterns in Europe were partly to blame for a 4.8 per cent decline in first-half results at Grolsch, the Dutch brewer which has recently made inroads to Britain and Germany. Net profit fell to Fl 14.2m (Dollars 7.7m) from Fl 14.9m in the first half of 1992, when a long spell of good weather in north-western Europe generated strong beer sales. This year, the weather had been 'no better than average'. The company blamed this in part for a 7.6 per cent decline in turnover, to Fl 391.8m. It also blamed the lower results on weak economies, especially in Germany, and on the decline of sterling, which depressed turnover from the company's Ruddles subsidiary and from its sales of Dutch-brewed beer destined for the UK market. Despite these difficult conditions, operating profit rose to Fl 24.5m from Fl 22.4m, reflecting rises in selling prices as well as declines in the prices of raw materials, marketing expenses and excise duties. However, financial income swung into a negative Fl 3.3m from a positive Fl 28,000 the year before, due to the 1992 cash acquisition of Ruddles and a heavy programme of investments requiring external financing.</p>

			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee 'on verge of major rally' Coffee prices are on the verge of a major rally, according to brokers GNI in its latest 'Market Alert', reports Reuter. Forecasting a possible medium-term target of 95 cents a pound for the New York July contract, which yesterday was trading just below 79 cents, the report said estimates of lower Central American and Colombian crops this season had combined with signs the producers' retention scheme was starting to bite. 'The timing of any move in commodity markets can often be distorted by physical flows, and we believe the time is now right to look for a major rally in coffee.' GNI said doubts over Brazil's political ability to hold its retention scheme together had been a major factor in preventing prices from rising over the past eight months. But there were signs that the government had nearly caught up with its retention obligations for the October-December period and the decision to hand the scheme over to exporters should prove effective, it added. The government would still be responsible through the auction system for retaining coffee registered before February 3, 'and consequently two programmes will be working at once. . . this will soak up the remainder of the 1993-94 crop'' the report said. In addition, the 1994-95 crop was expected to be 4m bags (60kg each) lower than this year's estimated 23m.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Afrikaans </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Commentary" column] </F>   [Text] Measured by the literally thousands of letters and  phone calls from compatriots, by the outcome and mass hysteria  during the 29 January volk's [Afrikaner people] congress in  Pretoria and the formation of self-protection units by hundreds  of thousands of Afrikaners/Boers, one concludes that the  Afrikaner volk is ready to shoot its way clear to  self-determination and its own country.    The volk now demands its leaders to spell out to it how  Afrikaner self-determination can be achieved so that the volk  can tread the chosen path to freedom with typical Afrikaner/Boer  passion. Our leaders have already openly admitted that it would  have been better to achieve self-determination peacefully and  without bloodshed, but added that freedom would be grabbed by  force if there was no other way out.    At ground level is an unprecedented anger spreading among  patriots as it becomes clearer that the de Klerk government is  selling them out "constitutionally" -- in the most atrocious way  imaginable -- to black heathen communists.    The de Klerk government, through withholding truths and  through blatant lies, and through misleading voters in several  elections and in the referendum, has virtually lied --  politically speaking -- the Afrikaner/Boer nation into a  communist revolution.    The awarding of the Philadelphia and the Nobel Prizes makes  up part of the international conspiracy to dress the two  political conspirators, de Klerk and Mandela, in a false cloak  of peace.    South Africa is the one place in the free world where there  is no peace and--in the event of a communist unitary government  after 27 April without the recognition and the realization of  the aspirations of self-determination of the Afrikaner/Boer  nation--peace will not be reached in this country in the next 40  years.    According to de Klerk's alleged opinion polls, the  Conservative Party [CP] and the Inkatha Freedom Party  collectively only make up 10 percent of potential voters, which  will mean that the ANC [African National Congress]-SACP [South  African Communist Party] will, in the eyes of the entire world,  get 90 percent of the votes, which, in an international context,  will be a "free and fair election" [preceding four words in  English].    With this type of propaganda de Klerk is trying to force the  Afrikaner/Boer nation behind the already crumbling multiracial  NP [National Party]. He still wants every white in the  democratic election to honestly lose, with him and the NP, the  struggle for the retention of an Afrikaner/Boer country.    The entire Afrikaner/Boer nation will fall in behind the CP  leadership once it has spelled out the way to Afrikaner/Boer  self-determination. But if the CP leaders hesitate to spell out  the way and the method, the man in the street will -- and they  are already busy doing it -- act without the leaders.    PATRIOT believes that the right decision will be made at the  right time, and we hope that those who write the constitution  will have good judgment so that they will include in the  constitution an Afrikaner/Boer volkstaat [homeland], a Zulu  state, and a Tswana state as a God-given right and a reality.  It will be an easy recipe for a peaceful settlement and will  help to avert a looming civil war.</p>

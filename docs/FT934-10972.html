			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Judicial body may be delayed THE GOVERNMENT will probably decide against measures to set up an independent body to investigate alleged miscarriages of justice when its criminal justice bill is introduced early in the next parliamentary session. Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, is understood to be anxious to keep the momentum of the law and order initiative going by securing a second Commons reading for a wide-ranging bill before Christmas. The tight timetable and the complexity of the work needed before the proposed investigating body can be set up acts against its inclusion. The Home Office is also hoping to secure a second reading for the Sunday trading bill before the new year. A police bill will ensure there is a pronounced law and order theme in the new session. If the investigating body is not included in the first draft of the criminal justice bill, it could possibly still be inserted either during that measure's committee stage or as part of the police bill. Neither is thought likely, however. The establishment of an independent review authority to investigate alleged miscarriages of justice and refer cases back to the Court of Appeal was recommended by the royal commission on criminal justice in July.</p>

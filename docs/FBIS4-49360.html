			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["News Analysis" by Wang Nan: "Why Business Disagrees With </F> Clinton on China Trade?"]    [Text] Washington, May 4 (XINHUA) -- In a month, a divided  Washington is to decide whether to extend China's most favored  nation (MFN) trade status. Now, U.S. businesses see ironies and  want to be heard.    These companies, ranging from telephone system to airplanes  and from paper to bulldozers, argue that MFN conveys no special  trade privileges and revoking it will impact America's  competitiveness abroad.    The White House must decide by June 3 whether to extend MFN  to China, a decision that Congress, if it desires, has a chance  to overturn. Without MFN, goods from China will be subject to  the prohibitive tariffs of the 1930s.    "We believe the first to be hurt by a reduction in  U.S.-China  trade would be American companies and workers," said William  Lane, government affairs manager in the Washington office of  Caterpillar Inc.    Caterpillar, which sells heavy earth moving equipment to  China, recently announced a joint venture with Shanghai Diesel  Engine Co. More than 1,000 of its workers are involved in  China-related businesses.    As China is engaged in more infrastructure projects, Lane  said, "these projects are the natural markets for Caterpillar's  products. China would well be our most important market in the  next five to 10 years."    The Peoria, Illinois-based manufacturer is just one of the  many U.S. businesses which have been opposing the stand of the  administration and congress to link China's trade with its other  behavior like human rights.    In fact, China, with the fastest growing economy, is helping  to keep U.S. production lines running. The Commerce Department,  in a standard analysis, estimates that 160,000 to 180,000 U.S.  jobs depend on U.S. trade with China.    The National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) finds the  real figure may be larger. In a report released today, NAM said  that some 1.3 million Americans work for firms for which the  China market is important.    "It is fair to say that each of these jobs would be less  secure if trade with China were further threatened or  eliminated," said NAM, which has just completed a survey of  China business among its 12,000 member companies.    Another observation of U.S. companies, explained John  Hayden,  vice president of the Boeing company's Washington office, is  that access to the Chinese market is essential to America's  efforts to retain industrial leadership.    Up to three billion dollars in China's plane orders for  Boeing would be at risk if MFN is denied, Hayden said. "In the  near term effect, this would give non-U.S. competitors a long  term foothold in an important market."    In a recent survey of 82 member firms by NAM, the effects of  commerce with China on the U.S. and on American firms are  expressed in varying tones and cover a number of aspects of U.S.  businesses.    It contains enthusiastic comments from the Procter and  Gamble, producer of bar soaps, shampoos and skin care and which  entered the Chinese market in 1988. The Cincinnati, Ohio-based  company says, "there will never be a start up as big as China."    The Gillette Company, a razor blades producer, gets to the  heart of the matter best. "Gillette is a global company, and  its operations in China make it a stronger company," the company  says in a statement.    Motorola, a leading provider of wireless communications,  semiconductors and advanced electronic systems, underscores the  nature of a global company by identifying technology it has  developed in China and now uses elsewhere.    "A stronger competitor with access to the China market will  have a major advantage over firms without comparable access,"  the Schaumburg, Illinois-based company says.    U.S. companies, meanwhile, stress that MFN is really a  misnomer since it allows a country's product to enter the U.S.  at the same tariff rates as most other countries.    With almost all of the more than 130 countries in the world  enjoying MFN treatment in trading with the U.S., "MFN, in a  fundamental sense, is the minimum requirement of meaningful  economic exchanges between two countries," said Jerry  Jasinowski, NAM's president.    Speaking at a press conference here today, he stressed that  unilateral imposition of restraints on trade to convey concerns  about other policy has historically been ineffective in  achieving changes.</p>

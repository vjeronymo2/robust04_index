			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading THE derivatives sector opened well in London as US buyers chased the June futures contract on the FT-SE 100 Index. The contract quickly advanced to the 2,850 area, but then ran into a stone wall as the buyers faded away and a handful of nervous sellers chipped away at the earlier levels. US buying appeared to be no more than position closing in London by two US investment houses seeking to cover overnight losses in New York. For the rest of the session it was the London locals, or independent traders, who held sway. There was further switching of holdings from the June contract into the September paper, which will take over leadership of the market later this month. Dealers said the differential of around 20 points between the two was in line with expectations at this stage. Business in traded options fell to 19,037 contracts from Monday's 26,069, with the FT-SE 100 option decreasing its contribution sharply to 2,893. Among individual contracts, British Aerospace, feeding off a strong share price, topped the actives with 1,762 lots. Dealers see the stock's strong performance since the end of last year as confirmation of recovery prospects. British Airways was close behind with 1,423 lots dealt, and there was renewed interest in TSB (1,223 contracts), although traders saw no reason for the renewed bid speculation.</p>

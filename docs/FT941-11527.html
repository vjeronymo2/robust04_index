			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / International Company News: IMI stock likely to open at 10% premium Shares in Istituto Mobiliare Italiano, the Italian financial services group privatised this week, look set to open at a premium of about 10 per cent, based on early indications from dealers in London. The shares in IMI, which closed its public tender offer ahead of schedule on Tuesday night following massive oversubscription, were being quoted at between L12,000 and L12,200, compared with an issue price of L10,900. The deal has caused considerable satisfaction in the Italian Treasury, which has sold about half its stake in the Rome-based financial services group. However, the possibility of a sharp premium when official trading starts next Wednesday may trigger criticism that IMI was sold too cheaply. Unofficial estimates suggest demand from institutions outside Italy for the 65m shares on offer exceeded supply by up to nine times. Details of demand for the US tranche of 35m shares have not been released. Retail investors in Italy are believed to have made about 370,000 applications to buy stock in the two days before the issue was closed. The level of demand suggests applications will be scaled back to the minimum 250 share level and may even mean some investors will go empty handed. It seems certain that the Treasury will sell the additional 19m shares held back for market stabilisation purposes, taking the overall proceeds from the issue to almost L2,400bn.</p>

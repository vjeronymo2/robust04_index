			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Singapore peaks again as Nikkei edges higher WHILE share prices traded within a narrow range due to a lack of fresh news, the Nikkei average firmed on small-lot buying from foreigners and arbitrage linked purchases, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei finished 52.67 up at 17,186.31 in spite of selling by tokkin, or specified money trusts. The index moved between 17,241.60, seen in the morning session, and 17,145.78 before the close. Volume rose to 240m shares from 175m. Advances led falls by 599 to 341, with 183 issues unchanged and the Topix index of all first section stocks gained 1.80 at 1,310.81. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 0.92 to 1,058.63. Traders said activity was led by the futures market, as most investors waited for the expected cut in the official discount rate. 'We are expecting the cut to be as large as 0.75 percentage point now,' said a trader at Nikko Securities. Public funds buying, which pushed the Nikkei index up 4.5 per cent last week, was absent yesterday as most fund managers had placed buy orders at lower levels. In spite of the sharp rise in share prices, the Tokyo Stock Exchange said outstanding margin buying fell by Y21.1bn to Y1,401.5bn last week, its 16th consecutive decline, reflecting the absence of genuine investors. Joyo Bank, a regional bank, was the most active issue of the day, rising Y10 to Y860. The issue was heavily cross- traded by financial institutions, realising profits on holdings without changing the composition of their portfolios. Isuzu Motors put on Y3 at Y372 on buying by dealers. The issue has been popular on the restructuring theme. Gajoen Kanko, the financially troubled hotel and restaurant operator, which rose on Monday on dealers' buying, lost Y13 to Y213 on profit-taking. NEC fell Y13 to Y641 on profit-taking by tokkin funds, foreigners and fund trusts. Some investors are also concerned over the company's fall in profitability due to the personal computer price wars in the Japanese market. Kyocera, the ceramic packaging maker for integrated circuits, weakened Y80 to Y4,360 on reports that International Business Machines, of the US, had filed a patent lawsuit over Kyocera's software. Sankyo Seiki, a music box manufacturer, surged Y64 to Y579 on rumours that it would merge with NMB Semiconductor, which is to be acquired by Nippon Steel, the leading steel maker, which owns 16 per cent of Sankyo. In Osaka, the OSE average moved forward 113.94 to 18,569.05 in 64.7m shares, rising for the sixth consecutive trading day on individual buying. Roundup THIN trading ranges seemed to be the order of the day in the region. SINGAPORE continued its record-breaking run, the Straits Times Industrial index closing 1.24 higher at 1,645.68, the third consecutive all-time peak. Turnover of 119.62m shares compared with Monday's 104.92m. Keppel Integrated Engineering was the most active stock, adding 10 cents at SDollars 1.59 after a brokerage house recommended the stock. KIE announced after the market closed that it had clinched two contracts in Thailand worth about SDollars 9m. HONG KONG closed lower after quiet trading, with demand dampened by the lingering Sino-British dispute over Hong Kong's political reform. The Hang Seng index receded 35.25 to 5,662.53 in the wake of selling by foreign investors, while turnover rose from HKDollars 1.7bn to HKDollars 1.8bn. News that Governor Chris Patten will enter hospital because of a heart ailment was released after the market closed. HSBC Holdings was the most traded issue, rising 50 cents to HKDollars 59.50. It was followed by its Hang Seng Bank unit, which was steady at HKDollars 56.50 after touching a high of HKDollars 57.50. AUSTRALIA took little heart from an improved balance of payments and the All Ordinaries index finished just 1.1 firmer at 1,530.2 in thin volume of ADollars 190.5m. Trade was dominated by Westpac, which ended 3 cents ahead at ADollars 3.00. Higher net profits announcements left Simsmetal 18 cents higher at ADollars 2.36 and Evans Deakin 20 cents stronger at ADollars 2.20. MANILA drifted lower, the composite index ending down 2.79 at 1,334.73. KUALA LUMPUR was broadly higher on a technical rebound after the recent losses. The composite index closed a net 3.89 to the good at 628.38 after some late profit-taking had dragged prices down from the day's highs. BANGKOK recovered from early losses as heavy buying of leading banks in the final minutes pushed the SET index ahead to end 4.05 up at 969.80.</p>

			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Biggest banks reject proposed watchdog BRITAIN'S four largest clearing banks have told regulators they will not participate in the Personal Investment Authority, the proposed self-regulatory body. The authority is intended to improve investor protection and spread the cost of compensation. The stance being taken by the banks could make it impossible to launch the authority. Life insurance companies, which provide most funding for the current self-regulatory structure, have said they will not participate unless banks and building societies do. If the PIA fails to get off the ground, the government is likely to review the self-regulatory structure for the financial services industry, according to banking sources. 'Sir Brian Hays (chairman of the PIA formation committee) has been telling the banks that if PIA fails, self-regulation fails,' said one banker familiar with the talks. The authority is intended to merge Lautro, the self-regulatory body for the life insurance and unit trust industries, and Fimbra, whose members are independent financial intermediaries. It is intended that unit trust sales forces who are members of Imro, which oversees the fund management industry, would join the PIA as well. It would need approval from 70 per cent of Lautro and Fimbra members. The primary objection voiced by Barclays, National Westminster, Midland and Lloyds is that they will be forced to increase substantially their contributions to the Investors Compensation Scheme to cover defaults among small independent financial intermediaries. The banks also fear that life insurers, their keenest competitors, will control at least a third of the votes on the PIA's board. Another fear is that, if each member is entitled to a single vote on important issues, the banks will be outvoted by small advisers on critical matters. Under the Financial Services Act, companies must belong to one of four self-regulatory organisations (SROs) covering different types of business, but may not be forced to join any particular one. They can also seek direct regulation from the Securities and Investments Board which oversees the SROs. The life insurance and unit trust arms of the clearing banks are mostly regulated by the SIB, as are some building societies. A consultative document outlining the charter of the PIA, designed to regulate the sale and marketing of all retail financial products, is to be released on September 24. The document is expected to offer inducements to encourage all providers of retail financial services to join the planned authority. Background, Page 12</p>

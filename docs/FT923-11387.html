			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / International Company News: Delta Air deficit soars to Dollars 180.2m in final quarter DELTA Air Lines, one of the three big US carriers, yesterday underlined the damage done to the industry's profitability by recent domestic 'fare wars', when it reported a net loss of Dollars 180.2m for the three months to end-June. The deficit compares with a small Dollars 19.2m profit in the same period a year earlier. At the operating level, the loss was even more pronounced - Dollars 265.4m, against a Dollars 50.6m surplus in 1991. The quarter is the last in Delta's financial year, and yesterday's results mean the airline is now posting an after-tax deficit of Dollars 506.3m for the full year, against a Dollars 324.4m loss in 1990/91. To help redress the situation, Delta plans to cut staffing by 5 per cent - it currently employs around 80,000 - in 1992, and convert an unspecified number of full-time positions to part-time status. The airline hoped to achieve the job cuts by attrition and the loss of temporary staff. It has already announced a Dollars 5bn cutback in planned capital expenditures over the next nine years, and other operational changes, including more use of seasonal flights, contract services, and new software systems, are also likely. In total, the airline estimates its financial results should benefit by around Dollars 375m in the new financial year, started on July 1. This annual benefit should increase to Dollars 700m by 1995, it said. Delta shares lost  3/4 at Dollars 52 3/4 . Like USAir, which also reported yesterday, Delta blamed the fourth-quarter loss on the US industry's 'competitive struggle, largely characterised by numerous deep-discount fare promotions'. 'While costs are rising, the average revenue per passenger mile in both domestic and international markets continues to be held down by uneconomic fare programmes,' said Mr Thomas Roeck, Delta's finance director. The fourth-quarter operating loss was scored on revenues of Dollars 2.83bn against Dollars 2.52bn last time. Operating expenses rose from Dollars 2.47bn to Dollars 3.09bn. Delta's load factor, year-on-year, slipped from 62.47 per cent to 60.2 per cent, while the passenger mile yield fell from 13.75 cents to 13.2 cents.</p>

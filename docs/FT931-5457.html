			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / International Company News: Outokumpu in the red for third year running OUTOKUMPU, the Finnish mining and metals group, narrowed its 1992 loss before extraordinary items to FM360m (Dollars 61m) from FM768m a year earlier, despite weak demand and prices for most of its main products. Sales rose 20 per cent to FM15.1bn, helped by the weaker markka, acquisitions and increased stainless steel deliveries. Operating income was FM604m, up from FM3m. A FM355m gain from the sale of holdings in mineral deposits and mining ventures was a positive influence on the result, as were rising raw material prices which produced inventory gains of FM77m. However, rationalisation write-offs of FM350m and FM304m in exchange losses depressed the performance. Rationalisation was concentrated on the copper products and technology divisions, both of which posted heavy losses. The deficit in copper products deepened to FM614m from FM497m, while losses in technology grew to FM319m from FM212m. The group's stainless steel unit benefited from a strong growth in sales, despite weak industry conditions, and it increased its profit to FM349m from FM201m. The base metals unit reversed last year's FM120m loss to produce a FM404m profit, helped by the consolidation of the OM Group. The group said its third consecutive year in the red meant there would again be no dividend. However, it expects a 'clear improvement in profitability' in 1993, thanks to its stronger competitive position and an anticipated upturn in its markets It said it would continue to rationalise and was ready to divest non-core businesses as part of a strategy of strengthening its balance sheet.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 17 KYODO -- The resignation of Russian  First Deputy Prime Minister Yegor Gaydar, who spearheaded  Russia's market reforms, will not affect relations between Japan  and Russia, Vice Foreign Minister Kunihiko Saito said Monday [17  January].    "If Gaydar's resignation weakens Russia's reform efforts, it  would be very regrettable," Saito told a press conference.    But Japan-Russia relations, and Japan's policy toward Russia  will not change because of the resignation of the reformist,  Saito said.    Japan has a policy of "adequately" supporting Russia's  efforts for democratization and its shift toward a  market-oriented economy and that policy will remain unchanged,  he said.    The Japanese Government hopes the Russian Government will  continue doing its utmost to achieve reforms, he said.    Gaydar, 37, announced Sunday he was leaving the government  over disagreements with its recent decisions.</p>

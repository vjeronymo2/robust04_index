Iliescu,  Romania's first popularly elected president, meets with his  South Korean counterpart Kim Yong-sam later in the afternoon and  will be the main guest at a state dinner. He will meet leaders  from both the ruling and opposition camps on Thursday. But the  highlight of his visit is an industrial tour and meetings with  business leaders that will take him to the southern part of the  country for a first-hand look at factories, with 22 businessmen  accompanying him.    Romania had been a staunch ally of North Korea until  Iliescu's election as president, and Seoul officials see his  visit as another sign of the cold war's collapse.    Kim and Iliescu will issue a joint statement after their  summit pledging to pursue dialogue on political and economic  cooperation. The two countries' foreign ministers will sign an  aviation agreement on Thursday.</p>

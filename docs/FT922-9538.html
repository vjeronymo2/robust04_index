			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (17): Morale lift for boutiques - A move towards specialist managers in the UK SOMETHING ODD seems to be going on among trustees when it comes to selecting pension fund investment managers. Are they, or are they not, abandoning the traditional UK preference for balanced managers in favour of US-style specialists? The latest evidence appears to point both ways at once. Until the late 1980s, British pension schemes not managed internally were nearly always entrusted to investment houses with a very broad brief - to invest at their discretion across the spectrum of equities, bonds and cash. Only property investment, always regarded as something of a law unto itself, was usually conducted by a specialist manager. This style of management, which produces a balanced portfolio, is in marked contrast to the US, where trustees themselves set a specific strategy for the fund and then hire numbers of specialist managers to carry out different aspects of the strategy. Only funds too small to warrant splitting up into separate tranches are generally managed by a broad-spectrum 'balanced' manager. By 1990 the UK picture had begun to change sufficiently for the National Association of Pension Funds' committee of inquiry into investment performance measurement to take note. In his report, the committee chairman, Maurice Stonefrost, commented on the 'move towards some specialisation of managers' briefs (and therefore greater trustee involvement in detailed asset allocation decisions).' Mr Stonefrost attributed this in part to the increasing availability of more detailed disaggregated information on managers' performance in the 'sub sets of balanced fund portfolios' - for example, in their international investment portfolios. He also believed that it reflected regulatory change. The Financial Services Act, for instance, requires trustees explicitly to define objectives as part of their contract with managers, because the ultimate responsibility for a fund's investment risk profile, and therefore broad asset allocation, lies with the trustees. That same year, a survey by Phillips &amp; Drew Fund Managers (PDFM) of large pension schemes, produced some electric figures in support of this view. Although only 14 per cent used specialist UK equity managers and 20 per cent used international equity specialists, more than 10 per cent said they were actively considering such a move. The enthusiasm with which trustees appeared to be embracing specialists was a great morale booster for small or new niche managers, who could not hope to compete across the board with large 'balanced' houses. One such niche (though hardly small) boutique is Lombard Odier Investment Management, the London-based fixed income and continental equities investment arm of the Geneva bank. Paul Abberley, LO's head of fixed income, explained: 'We are seeing a trend towards funds splitting into a balanced core and specialist satellites as and when they review the structure of their operations. There is no reliable data yet, but the shift is quite strong whenever trustees undertake their reviews.' Even the established houses are prepared to concede that they may soon face competition from specialists. However, Chris Cheetham, director of investment strategy at the Prudential, warned that Mr Stonefrost may have overstated the change. 'We are seeing the growth of specialisation,' said Mr Cheetham, 'but it won't reach US proportions.' Today his caution seems more than justified. A second survey carried out by PDFM in 1991 showed little growth in the numbers of specialists actually hired. But, more important, the number of trustees actively considering their use had dropped sharply to under 4 per cent. And the initial figures from the 1992 survey, which will be published in the summer, are nearly identical to last year's. If PDFM's figures are reliable, 'the move from balanced to specialist, which most commentators expected to accelerate, appears to have come to a very sharp stop.' PDFM can throw little light on the turnround, although they speculate that there may be three factors at work: 1, The difficulty of controlling asset allocation within a specialist structure; 2, The difficulty of coping with innovation in a rigid specialist structure (except by adding more and more specialists); and 3, Lack of evidence of any improvement in performance. If trustees have abandoned their shift to specialists on the basis of poor performance over just two years, this will disappoint Mr Stonefrost's committee, which strongly advised that performance should be measured against a background of no less than five years. But it may be that PDFM's surveying equipment is not sensitive enough for what is going on. Lombard Odier, for example, has noticed a shift from balanced to regional bond and equity portfolios as updated computer facilities have introduced trustees to tactical asset allocation techniques. This in turn, they say, has meant that trustees who used to 'employ more than one balanced manager, now farm out the asset allocation decision to these professionals who in turn appoint a growing number of specialists'. Thus, in one sense, the trustees can still claim to be running balanced funds while simultaneously promoting the growth of specialists. PDFM's antennae have been able to pick up another curious fact: a clear tendency for larger schemes to go the specialist route, sometimes by appointing an internal specialist. It is possible that the internalising process may have taken the place of overt external specialisation to the point where the slow growth of external specialists does not tell the true story. If that is so, it suggests that trustees want to have their cake and eat it, carrying out specialist techniques under a balanced label.</p>

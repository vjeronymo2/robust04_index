			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Survey of Executive Cars (17): Love affair continues - Alternatives / Four-Wheel Drive DESPITE three years of recession, the British motorist's love affair with four-wheel drive continues. Last year, 39,230 on-off road 4x4s were registered, which was 2.46 per cent of the market and a volume increase of 37 per cent on 1991, when 28,674 were sold. Children are taken to school, secretaries go to their offices and businessmen travel to meetings in rugged, high-slung Range Rovers and Land Rover Discoveries, Mitsubishi Shoguns and Isuzu Troopers. Some, but not many, are even driven off the tarmac now and again, fulfilling the function for which they were designed. What is so attractive about on-off road vehicles in which the engine's power is put on the road permanently or occasionally through four wheels, not two? The question defies logical answer. Family cars never spin their drive wheels on dry roads. But they may do on wet ones. In a wintry spell, sheer lack of grip can bring any car to a stop. Four-wheel drive halves the amount of power each drive wheel tyre has to transmit - which in turn halves the probability of the tyre losing grip and spinning. So a car with four driven wheels is four times more likely to keep moving and behave itself on slippery surfaces than one with only front- or rear-wheel drive. In cars with a lot of surplus power, four-wheel drive has a wonderfully calming effect. There is a strong case to be made for it on safety grounds alone. But, curiously, sales of purely road-going four-wheel-drive cars have not lived up to the high hopes expressed when the original Audi Quattro turbo-coupe startled the motoring world with its sheer driveability in 1980. It is the on-off road 4x4 vehicle, descended in concept from the Jeep of the Second World War, that the public clamours to drive. All have two-range manual transmissions giving 10 forward ratios, or eight when automatic. The paradox is that many - some would say most - owners or users have no idea how to drive them off-road or have any need of all their heavy and costly mechanical complication. The makers know there is a strong streak of fantasising and wish fulfilment in on-off road 4x4 purchase. Executives sitting up high in 10-geared Discoveries or Shoguns may justify their choice on safety grounds - 'It feels so strong' - or convenience: 'I must be able to get to the station when it snows'. More practically, they may find the vehicles handy at the weekend for pulling horse-boxes, dragging boats up slipways or filling with children and dogs. Young men and women, forced into giving up hot hatchbacks by punitive insurance rates, turn to 4x4s as macho substitutes with an agreeable hint of a Barbour jacket, breeches and Purdeys lifestyle. The rough, tough four-wheel drive you cleaned inside and out - if you ever cleaned it at all - with a high-pressure hosepipe is a threatened species. Survivors are the Land Rover Defender, consisting essentially of Discovery mechanicals and an austerely equipped body, and the cart-sprung Daihatsu Fourtrak and Jeep Wrangler. Britain's best-selling 4x4 by far is the highly successful Land Rover Discovery which is really a Range Rover wearing trendier clothes. The petrol V8 is very thirsty; the great majority sold are diesels, powered by an unrefined but frugal 2.5-litre direct injection engine that rewards light-footed drivers with more than 32mpg (8.83 l/100km). The 22-year-old Range Rover, which is beginning to look dated, has been eclipsed by Discovery. It does everything the poshest Range Rover Vogue can do at not much more than half the price. Main foreign competitors of the Range Rover and Discovery are the Mitsubishi Shogun, Isuzu Trooper and Toyota Land Cruiser. Other full-size on-off road 4x4s used as substitutes for conventional executive-class saloons or estate cars include the Mercedes-Benz Gelandewagen and Nissan Patrol and, since the beginning of this year, Chrysler Jeep Cherokee. Although the dollar has hardened considerably against sterling since Cherokee import prices were announced last autumn, it has few rivals as a value-for-money package. About Pounds 20,000 buys a 4-litre, leather-trimmed, air-conditioned Cherokee automatic with cruise control, power windows, alloy wheels and ABS brakes. It can be used on the road in two-wheel or four-wheel drive. Being very high geared - 30mph at 1,000rpm - it is quiet and economical - about 20mpg on a motorway - and handles more like a high-slung Volvo estate than an on-off road vehicle. Two interesting newcomers about to go on sale in Britain are the Spanish-built Nissan Terrano II and its Ford-badged clone, the Maverick. Nissan knows exactly what kind of market the Terrano II will sell in. It describes it as a competent performer on the rough stuff but says it is mainly intended to offer the same level of comfort and refinement as a modern passenger car. There are three-door and five-door estate versions with 2.7-litre turbo-diesel or 2.4-litre petrol engines.</p>

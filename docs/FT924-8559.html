			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Survey of Computers in Finance (14): Starting from scratch - The new Bank of Edinburgh is consolidating client information THE Bank of Edinburgh, a start-up bank funded by venture capital, intends get away from the traditional banking services which restrict clients to a set of pre-defined product offerings. Instead it wants to tailor packages of banking services to meet its clients' individual needs. In order to do so, it is installing a computer system imported from Canada. The system is novel in UK banking terms in two ways. It is sufficiently flexible to cope with individually tailored packages for clients. It also runs on a personal computer network. According to operations director Mr Sandy Macdonald, the bank has tried to move the parameters of retail banking. Most banks today offer products: mortgages, higher interest accounts, 60-day notice accounts, and personal loans, are some examples. These products are the parameter for storing customer information on the computer systems. But on the Bank of Edinburgh system, the data is structured so that the customer is considered as a single account. It stores customer information under their name, combined with a unique customer number. Every piece of business that the customer does with the bank is registered as a sub-set of that account: under the customer's name there might be three sub-sets, say, one for normal instant access, one for 90 days notice and another for a loan. The system can also consolidate a client's entire banking data on to a single statement. So instead of getting separate statements for their higher interest and cheque accounts, the client gets one statement showing both accounts. 'The system is geared towards the relationship between the bank and the customer,' says Mr Macdonald. 'No matter how many accounts a customer has, we treat them as a whole, and at any time we can see that customer's relationship with the bank,' he says. The system is also able to break down information. For example, a solicitor's partnership might wish some items to be broken down to help it manage its own internal cost allocations. 'As long as you can identify the date, time and nature of the transaction, you can begin to start grouping things together . . . Possibly the reason why it has not been done before is because the descriptions have not been good enough,' says Mr Macdonald. For example, bank statements will usually show that a cheque was paid in, but not where it was from. 'We believe the manner in which we will use the transaction codes will be more flexible,' says Mr Macdonald. Software for the system was developed by Canadian banking software specialist Prologic, working with the Richmond Savings Bank in Vancouver. It is based on Prologic's own fourth generation language (4GL) software, known as Probe. The 4GL language is generally considered to be more flexible and easier to work with than older computer languages such as Cobol. The Richmond Savings Bank installation now has 350 PCs in 10 branch offices, all linked across telecommunications lines. It handles 600,000 accounts and processes 115,000 client transactions a day. It is claimed that a PC in a branch can retrieve information from the database in three seconds. The software was adapted to handle UK banking regulations by the Bristol-based software house Apak. A deal was arranged between Apak and the Bank of Edinburgh, whereby Apak would refine the system to meet the bank's requirements, but Apak would keep the intellectual property rights. It hopes to sell the product in other parts of Europe. The Bank of Edinburgh system, which is now installed, is much smaller than the Vancouver one. It has only seven 386 PC terminals, and two 486 PCs acting as file servers: one runs the network and the other stores the customer accounts database. This is expected to be sufficient to handle early requirements for the bank. Its strategy is to expand by acquisition, and it is currently bidding for the Heart of England building society. Assuming the acquisition is successful, others could follow. Any acquired building societies will be able to continue using their own systems, but will also be able to gain flexibility by linking up to the bank's system if they wish to. As it is built on industry-standard software and hardware, this should not be difficult. The Bank of Edinburgh's system achieves a goal that many other retail banks worldwide are aiming for. According to Mr Paul Stockton, a banking specialist with Hoskyns Consulting, the banks today are looking to improve customer service but also want to ensure remain profitable. One issue that many are looking at is market segmentation. The large banks need large numbers of customers, and the only way they feel they can service that mass market is with standardised products. Personalised service of the type by the Bank of Edinburgh is a way to attract the higher value personal and business customers, says Mr Stockton. 'People now expect more from banking and all the banks are looking at market segments and niches' he says. Many, such as the large UK high street banks, are constrained by older, monolithic mainframe systems, developed many years ago for a different type of banking market. All are making huge investments in new customer-oriented databases. But the huge investments required mean the process has taken a long time. Start-up operations such as the Bank of Edinburgh, have the luxury of being able to design systems from scratch. Another example is the Midland Bank's telephone banking subsidiary, First Direct. At First Direct, bank staff sit at computer terminals with all the information about a customer at their fingertips. Mr Macdonald stresses that the Bank of Edinburgh is not aiming to imitate First Direct. It does not have access to the wider range of banking services, such as cash point machines, that First Direct can obtain from Midland; therefore, it is clearly positioning itself at the high value market segment, which its own technology can adequately serve.</p>

			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / World Trade News: US under attack by Brussels THE EC yesterday delivered its annual broadside on US barriers to trade in a report that particularly targets Washington's 'increasing tendency' to undermine the Gatt world trading system with unilateral or bilateral solutions. In addition to the 'Super 301' provisions of US trade law, often used to trigger unilateral retaliatory action, Washington is tending to reach bilateral deals with Japan, Korea and China, to the detriment of third countries, as well as trying to extend extra-territorial legislation to others. As a result of last year's amendments to its Marine Mammal Protection act, the US is boycotting tuna from Mexico and Venezuela for failing to keep dolphins out of their nets, and threatening to extend a secondary boycott to all countries, including the EC, which do not also ban their tuna. However, the EC executive was also careful to point out that bilateral trade flows between the US and EC still run at about Dollars 190bn a year, and to laud the benefits of recently increased dialogue.</p>

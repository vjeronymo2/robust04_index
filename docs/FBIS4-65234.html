			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Punctuation as published--single parentheses surround the </F> original Turkish placenames, while those that are not in  parentheses are Kurdish; the farming settlements listed are  identified by their Kurdish names]    [Text] Diyarbakir--The state forces are maintaining their  blockade against the villages in the mountainous area in the  triangle of Diyarbakir's Kulp and Lice and Bingol's Genc  Districts. They besieged the area after clashing with guerrillas  affiliated with the Kurdish Workers Party's Kurdish People's  Liberation Army on 26 April. They are allowing no one to enter  or leave the villages. Riz (Saggoze), Satoz (Yazkonak), Arxat  (Yolacti), and Azgler (Geyikdere) in Genc district; Pecar  (Guldiken) in Lice district; and Zara [not further specified]  and Gomak [not further specified] in Kulp district have been  surrounded by state forces.    We asked a villager to explain the situation in the besieged  villages. He said: "A clash occurred near Satoz on 26 April.  The state forces besieged all the villages and farming  settlements in the area after the fighting. No one has been  allowed to enter or leave the area."    Several villagers say that no information has been received  on the situation in the farming settlements of Norsin, Lehesar,  Mordari, and Herki. Stressing that revelations by the State of  Emergency Governor's Office conflict with the realities, the  villagers said that the troops shot and killed a girl of 15.  The officials, they said, described her as a "terrorist." They  also said that three shepherds were killed in attacks on the  farming settlement of Ziqte. They noted that they were unable  to establish their names.    The State of Emergency Governor's Office revealed yesterday  that "the security forces have killed 14 terrorists in Saggoze  in Genc district and three terrorists in Karliova District's  rural areas."

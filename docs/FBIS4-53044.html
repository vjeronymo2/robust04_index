			<p>CSO     [Text] Asahi Glass has jointly developed with English and  French engineering companies a new method for using reinforced  glass in external walls of buildings. Several sheets of  two-meter-square plate glass are suspended by wire tied by  special fittings that incorporate a bearing mechanism, and a  special feature is that it appears to be one sheet of glass  since there are no sash frames. It is different from regular  plate glass at the company, and they will push sales to design  offices via three engineering subsidiaries. Estimates are for  sales of 2 billion yen the first year and 10 billion yen after  five years.    It will be put on sale starting the 11th under the product  name of "Ten Point." It was jointly developed with "Ove Arup" of  England and "RFR" of France. Special fittings are installed in  saucer-shaped holes opened in the four corners of 12-mm thick  reinforced glass and the glass is tied together. A bearing  mechanism is incorporated in the special fitting, forming a  structure that will absorb glass "flexure" generated by wind and  earthquakes. The special fittings are tied by stainless wire,  which is bundled and fastened to a post.    The basic technology was developed by Peter Rice who is the  director in charge of technology at Ove, and Asahi Glass  introduced the technology four years ago, matching it to  Japanese specifications such as no water leakage. It is said  that it will not be destroyed even by an earthquake in the class  of the Great Kanto Earthquake.</p>

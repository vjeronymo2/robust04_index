			<p><P> April 16, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> WELCH PROVES TO ATHLETICS THAT HE'S READY  </P> <P> Bob Welch's pitching in spring training was so disappointing, the Oakland  Athletics didn't think he would be ready when the season began.  </P> <P> And the first pitch the veteran right-hander threw in his first start was hit  for a home run.  </P> <P> However, that was not an indication of things to come.  </P> <P> Welch held the Mariners to three hits in 6 1/3 innings Sunday at Seattle, and  Mark McGwire hit a two-run homer in the Athletics' 3-0 victory.  </P> <P> Welch is 2-0. Since Minnesota's Dan Gladden hit a home run Tuesday night at  Oakland, Welch has not yielded a run. He has given up only eight more hits in  11 2/3 innings.  </P> <P> In each victory, McGwire hit a two-run home run for the winning hit.  </P> <P> "His spring training numbers (0-3 and an earned-run average of 17.36) were  ugly," A's Manager Tony La Russa said. "It was important for him to get off to  a good start. He had control of his stuff and control of himself. He didn't  give them much to hit."  </P> <P> Welch helped himself with a barehand stab of Jeff Leonard's sharp bouncer,  which he turned into a double play to end the fourth inning.  </P> <P> "Oakland has everything. Even their pitchers are great fielders," Seattle  Manager Jim Lefebvre said.  </P> <P> The Athletics are getting very effective pitching. They are 5-1 and the staff  ERA is 2.00. The sweep of the three-game series was their first in the Kingdome  since April, 1986. The Mariners have lost five in a row since beating the  Angels in the season opener.  </P> <P> Chicago 4, Cleveland 1 -- The White Sox brought up third baseman Robin Ventura  from double-A Birmingham at the end of last season so he could get major league  experience.  </P> <P> Now the rookie from Santa Maria who played college ball at Oklahoma State, is  expected to become a star. He took a big step in that direction Sunday at  Chicago.  </P> <P> Ventura had three hits, including a double and triple, and made a sensational  diving catch to lead the White Sox.  </P> <P> He also scored a run and drove in one, but White Sox Manager Jeff Torborg was  raving about the play that took a double away from Brook Jacoby in the fifth  inning.  </P> <P> "We know that Ozzie (Guillen) is a great shortstop," Torborg said, "and Ventura  gives us a cornerstone to build on. I also like the way he swings the bat."  </P> <P> New York 3, Texas 1 -- For one day at least, the Yankees discovered that four  of their relievers were more effective than the Rangers' bullpen stopper.  </P> <P> The four Yankee relievers pitched six shutout innings, while Jeff Russell, who  led American League relievers last season by converting 44 opportunities into  38 saves, couldn't hold the lead for Charlie Hough.  </P> <P> Hough gave up just two singles in seven innings at New York, but when he walked  the lead-off man in the eighth, Russell was summoned.  </P> <P> Russell made a wild pitch, then made a wild throw after fielding a bunt and  gave up run-scoring singles to Rick Cerone and Steve Sax.  </P> <P> "In this job you're either a star or a goat," Russell said. "I was a goat  today, but I'll be a star tomorrow. But it's unfortunate these things happen.  It hurt to see Charlie pitch so well and have the game get away. It eats you."  </P> <P> Russell's collapse made a winner of Eric Plunk, his second victory in relief.  Dave Righetti pitched the ninth for his second save.  </P> <P> Toronto 5, Kansas City 4 -- Even though he went four for four, including a  bases-loaded double, Junior Felix still doesn't like Royals Stadium.  </P> <P> "I just can't see the ball here," he said. "Today, I tried something different  and it must have helped. I straightened up in my stance. I saw the ball better.  I still don't like this park."  </P> <P> The Royals, behind Tom Gordon, were leading, 2-0, after five innings. But the  Blue Jays loaded the bases in the sixth inning, and Felix hit the ball over  center fielder Willie Wilson's head for a three-run double.  </P> <P> "I guess he played me a little too shallow," Felix said. "I don't know if he  would have caught it anyhow. I hit it hard."  </P> <P> Although Dave Stieb gave up nine hits in six innings, the five-run inning  enabled him to improve his record to 2-0.  </P> <P> The Blue Jays won the series, 2-1. Last season the Royals had the best home  record in the majors, 55-26.  </P> <P> Detroit 6, Baltimore 4 -- When Mark Salas hit a two-run home run in the eighth  inning, it made Dan Petry a winner in his return to Detroit.  </P> <P> Petry, a starter for the world champion Tigers in 1984, pitched two innings of  scoreless relief to win his first game for Detroit since Sept. 15, 1987.  </P> <P> Petry was traded to the Angels after the 1987 season and released after last  season. The Tigers signed him to a minor-league contract, so he had the benefit  of the full six weeks of spring training.  </P> <P> "I didn't think I pitched very well today," Petry said. "But I kept them from  scoring. It's a big thrill to come back here and make a contribution. I hope I  can do it often." DAN HAFNER  </P></p>

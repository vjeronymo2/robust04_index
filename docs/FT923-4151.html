			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / International Company News: Indonesian banks hit by capital requirements INDONESIA's quoted private banks have published generally poor half-year results due partly to financial restructuring to meet higher capital adequacy requirements. In March the government enforced a capital adequacy requirement of 5 per cent, to be raised to 7 per cent by next March and 8 per cent by December 1993, in accordance with Bank for International Settlements guidelines. To meet the requirement last March, some banks moved substantial funds into central bank certificates, which attract a zero capital adequacy weighting, as against customer loans, which carry a 100 per cent weighting. The result, however, has been a loss of interest income. Central bank certificates offer interest at about 17 per cent, substantially below customer lending rates of 25 per cent, and lower even than average deposit rates of 19 per cent. In the most extreme case, Bank Duta increased funds held with the central bank 254 per cent to Rp292bn (USDollars 143m) on the year-earlier period and showed an 11 per cent fall in interest income to Rp215bn. Bank Duta's total loan portfolio contracted 11 per cent to Rp1,750bn over the same period of 1991, although its cost of funds rose 6.4 per cent to Rp198bn. It announced a fall in operating profits in the first six months to Rp6.6bn from Rp13.7bn in the same period of 1991. Brokers regard the interim operating profit as a better indication of performance than the net profit figure, because most banks delay making sufficient provision for bad and doubtful debts until the second half of the year. While profits have fallen, brokers note the higher capital adequacy requirement will improve the long-term health of the banking sector. Bank Danamon announced a fall in operating profit from Rp21bn to Rp18bn, although it increased its loan portfolio 43 per cent year-on-year to Rp3,105bn. Bank Internasional Indonesia's operating profits dropped 16 per cent to Rp56bn, although it increased its loan portfolio 28 per cent to Rp3,212bn year-on-year. Brokers said it had provided for bad debt and were optimistic on improved full-year figures. Bank Niaga's operational profits for the half year to June fell to Rp2.3bn from Rp13bn with the loan portfolio remaining static at Rp2,470bn. Bank Bali bucked the trend by increasing operating profits 18 per cent to Rp40bn, although brokers regard provision for bad debt at just 0.5 per cent of the its loan portfolio as insufficient. The World Bank has approved a Dollars 300m loan to provide new capital for five of Indonesia's state-owned banks. The loan is to assist the banks in reaching higher capital adequacy targets.</p>

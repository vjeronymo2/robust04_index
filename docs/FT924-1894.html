			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Russia - The Future of Reform: PM and banker seen as dangerous duo THE appointment of Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin as prime minister has been greeted with the same caution in Moscow's foreign business and diplomatic community as it has been abroad. Mr Chernomyrdin is little known outside Russia, nor is he known beyond the energy sector in the country. Those working in the sector have mixed views. 'He has done nothing (as energy minister) for 12 months,' said one experienced mineral resources professional. 'He is a good, straightforward industrial manager,' said another. The comments of foreign business need to be set against a depressed commercial environment: a number of representative offices, notably the big Siemens presence, are cutting or are not filling vacant posts. The huge drop in orders for western goods, and the slow and so far largely unrewarding experience of joint ventures, has long punctured the bubble of enthusiasm in the Russian economy. The balance of diplomatic comment is that he will continue reforms which are anyway difficult to stop in principle - such as privatisation. However, some believe he will be a dangerous man to combine with Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, the central bank chairman who has said he puts industrial needs before purely financial ones. Mr Chernomyrdin confirmed this impression yesterday at his first press conference, when he said that 'the first issue is to stop the decline in industry and we will need a certain amount of spending and finance for this'. On the threat of hyperinflation, he said he was 'thinking about it'. However, 'the simple formula, Gaidar equals reform, no Gaidar equals no reform, is clearly not applicable here,' according to a senior western economic counsellor. 'Mr Chernomyrdin has said he's more friendly to industry, but Gaidar was speaking about an industrial policy too. The new prime minister will be working within the same parameters as the previous prime minister.' Mr Chernomyrdin said he wanted 'normal co-operation' with foreign businessmen (he met a group of German business leaders yesterday after talks with Chancellor Helmut Kohl) and said that he was quite ready to keep the US advisers presently working with the government - 'and there will certainly be some Germans, and Russians. 'The important thing is whether they want to help us,' he said. Meanwhile, the change in leadership is expected to further delay negotiations with the International Monetary Fund on a full standby agreement, which would allow Russia to borrow up to Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.6bn) from the Washington-based institution. Delays are also expected in loan negotiations with the World Bank. A meeting between IMF officials and the Russian government to review progress towards economic reform which had originally been scheduled for Friday has now been put off till January 11. Even on optimistic assumptions about Russia's ability to implement a reform programme that will satisfy the IMF, it would take at least three months after that to complete a standby agreement. However, IMF officials point out that they have already lived through one change of government in Russia, having started negotiations with the government of Mr Mikhail Gorbachev and his economic adviser, Mr Grigori Yavlinsky. Russian ministers said when they joined the Fund last spring that they hoped to complete a standby agreement by the end of May (1992). However, international bankers say the country has only drawn Dollars 300m so far from a Dollars 1bn preliminary IMF credit tranche which was not conditional on a reform programme. Bankers say the reason for Russia's failure to use the IMF money is not clear, but the most prominent explanation is that the interest rates are too high. Washington monetary sources say that western financial aid has continued to flow to Russia, despite the absence of an economic reform programme that they would regard as adequate.</p>

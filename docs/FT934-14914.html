			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Dangers of loss of charity tax status Sir, The Charity Commission has made it clear that charities can only campaign as pressure groups on issues where they have direct experience as care providers. It thus seems unlikely that the recent report, recommending a division between voluntary operations providing local or centrally funded care and charities with no agency income, will provide the expected impetus for pressure group and campaigning activities. As care-providing charities offer an alternative delivery system to local or central government units - which are effectively operating tax-free - it will seriously restrict voluntary agencies if they have to price their services after losing charity tax status.

			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / Bank of France's autonomy delayed: Independence Awaits Treaty THE LAW making the Bank of France independent of the French government must be postponed until after implementation of the Maastricht treaty on European union, according to a ruling by the French constitutional council. The ruling, which should delay the legislation until after a European Community summit in late October, comes at a sensitive time. The French central bank is not only burdened by a deficit on its foreign exchange holdings following its unsuccessful efforts to defend the franc, but is poised for a change of governor. Mr Jacques de Larosiere, the present governor, is expected this week to be appointed president of the Bank of European Reconstruction and Development in London and to be replaced at the Bank of France by Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, a highly respected financier who is now director of the Treasury. He was previously an aide to Mr Edouard Balladur, now the French prime minister. The independence of the Bank of France, required under the terms of the Maastricht treaty, has been one of the main legislative projects undertaken by the French centre-right government since it took office this spring. The legislation was passed by parliament earlier this summer but requires the constitutional council's approval before implementation. The council's ruling means any move will have to wait until Germany has ratified the Maastricht treaty. The German parliament has already done so and the treaty is now awaiting approval by the German constitutional council, which is expected to announce its decision by early October. A European Community summit, which will finally endorse the treaty, is scheduled for the end of that month.</p>

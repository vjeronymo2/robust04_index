			<p>BFN     [Text] Phnom Penh AKP May 26 -- His Majesty King Norodom  Sihanouk has said that a solution is still impossible to put an  end to the mortal de facto partition of Cambodia.    In a letter addressed the 25 May to U.N. Secretary General  Butros Butros-Ghali, the king said Cambodia was unfortunately  divided in two parties, one is the zone under the government  control and another is the Khmer Rouge autonomous zone.    However, the king said he had to obtain from the Khmer  leaders of the two warring parties a durable and unconditional  cease-fire on the whole territory of Cambodia.    The Cambodian government side agrees with the cease-fire,  but  the Khmer Rouges still keep silence in this matter, King  Sihanouk said.    The Khmer Rouges did not implement the Paris peace agreement  of Oct 23, 1991, therefore a new meeting in Paris or Jakarta  would be useless, the king said.    No one will be able to threaten the Khmer Rouges to do what  they refuse to do, King Sihanouk said.    "This is a long-term problem which threatens the existence  of  Cambodia and worries me a great deal and causes me to fall in  despair," he said.    King Sihanouk said he would preside over the round-table  talks at Chhanghsu-on on May 27, with the participation of  National Assembly Chairman Chea Sim, Co-Prime Ministers Prince  Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen, and Khieu Samphan, president of  Kampuchea Democratic party.</p>

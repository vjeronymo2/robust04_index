			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Arts: Gilchrist award winner Alasdair Gilchrist Fisher died of cancer at the age of 24. As his illness overcame him, he took to landscape painting. Nothing could be more appropriate as a memorial to him than an annual award in his name to be given to a young artist whose special commitment was to landscape painting. The age limit is 30 and the prize Pounds 3000. Last summer an independent jury chose six finalists from a slide submission of over 100, who were then invited to take part in a joint exhibition at which the final decision would be taken. That took place last Monday. Daniel Preece, for all its awkwardnesses, offered the single most ambitious and impressive painting in the show, of a large Welsh mountainside. Peter Grierson's looser and more abstracted expressionism achieved a rich concentration of effect. Stacey Billups was somewhat the odd one out, her large surreal inventions more objects in landscape rather than landscape alone, but entirely sustained and convincing even so. Alasdair Wallace was another inventive surrealist rather than an artist responding to the seen world. In his case, though, the invention was in the composition overall, the detail beautifully observed. Tom Hammick came the closest to abstraction, his largest paintings the simplest matter of horizon dividing ground and sky, but carried off with admirable conviction. The award, finally, went to Angela Hughes, for her large landscape drawings that grow ever more simple and evocative, and for her small oil studies that were, quite simply, the most accomplished works in the show. But do go and support them all. At Cadogan Contemporary, 108 Draycott Avenue SW3, until Jan22.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Additionally, in order to ensure that sales are only made to eligible recipient agencies with approved processing contracts, &sect;250.30(c)(4)(xv) of the current regulations requires that as part of the processing contract, the contracting agency must provide the processor with a list of all recipient agencies eligible to purchase end products under the contract. However, the current rule implies, but does not explicitly require, the contracting agency to provide updates to the list of recipient agencies for any changes that occur during the contract period. Therefore, to clarify the regulation, &sect;250.30(c)(4)(xv) of the proposed rule would require the contracting agency to provide updates to the list of recipient agencies for any changes which occur during the contract period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sixteen comments were received on these two proposals, all in favor of the provisions as proposed. Accordingly, this final rule adopts &sect;&sect;250.30(c)(4)(xv) and 250.30(m) of the proposed State processing regulations without change.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Quarterly Processing Activity Reports and Annual Reconciliation Reports  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule provided for major revisions in the areas of quarterly inventory reports, the annual reconciliation report and the monthly performance reports. Sections 250.30(m)(1), 250.30(n) (3) and (4), and 250.30(o)(1) proposed to amend the State processing regulations as follows: 1) the quarterly inventory reports and the annual reconciliation report would be replaced with the monthly performance reports with year-to-date totals; 2) distributing agencies would be required to forward to the FCS Regional Office the monthly performance report with year-to-date totals provided by the processor for the last month of each Federal fiscal quarter; 3) when forwarding these monthly performance reports, they would be required to be postmarked no later than 60 days following the close of each Federal fiscal quarter, except that such reports must be postmarked no later than 90 days following the close of the contract period; 4) when a processor submitted no monthly performance report for the last month of a Federal fiscal quarter, distributing agencies would be required to submit to the FCS Regional Office the last monthly performance report received from the processor for that Federal fiscal quarter; 5) the last monthly performance report for the contract period would serve as the annual reconciliation report; 6) distributing agencies would be required to certify the accuracy of the information contained in the final performance report; and 7) when a processor submitted no monthly performance report for the last month of the contract period, the last monthly performance report received from the processor would serve as the annual reconciliation report and this final performance report would be required to be postmarked no later than 90 days following the close of the contract period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Seventeen comments were received on the above provisions contained in the proposed rule. Regarding the replacement of the quarterly inventory reports with the monthly performance reports, seven comments were received, four in favor and three opposed. However, based on comments received, it appears that some commenters may have misunderstood the purpose for replacing the quarterly inventory reports with the monthly performance reports with year-to-date totals. Under the current regulations, performance reports are required to contain inventory information on a monthly basis, but not on a quarterly basis. Distributing agencies are required to extract inventory information from the performance reports and compile this information on a quarterly basis for submission to the FCS Regional Office. Requiring that performance reports have year-to-date totals of inventory information would eliminate the need for distributing agency staff to prepare a quarterly inventory report. This reduces the workload of the distributing agency staff and only requires a small change in the processor's performance report format.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore, it was not the intent of the Department that distributing agencies photocopy the entire content of the performance report for submission to the FCS Regional Office. While sales activity for the month usually comprises the major part of the performance report, processors typically show inventory activity on a separate page of the monthly performance report. On the inventory summary portion of the performance report, all sales are represented by a single inventory drawdown figure which represents the cumulative total of all individual sales reported for the month. The intent of the proposed rule was for distributing agencies to send the inventory summary portion of the December, March and June performance reports that contains the inventory information (i.e., beginning inventory, receipts for the month, transfers in and out, inventory drawdown, and ending inventory balance with year-to-date totals) to the FCS Regional Offices, and not the entire performance report.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

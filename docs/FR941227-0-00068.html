			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Trust Provisions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed regulations also provide that each qualified nuclear decommissioning trust agreement must require that assets of the Fund be used as authorized by section 468A and the regulations thereunder and that the agreement cannot be amended to violate section 468A or the regulations thereunder. Commentators argued that this provision exceeds the IRS's authority. It is apparent from section 468A(e)(4) (which requires that amounts in a Fund be used exclusively for decommissioning, associated expenses, or, when not currently needed for those purposes, to make investments) and from the special section 468A tax rules (including the preferential tax rates on Fund earnings for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1993), that Congress intended for amounts set aside in these Funds to be available for decommissioning of nuclear power plants. The IRS believes it is consistent with this Congressional intent, and with the IRS's responsibilities for successfully administering the program, to require that the trust agreements limit use of Fund assets to section 468A purposes. Accordingly, the final regulations retain this requirement. To ensure that taxpayers have sufficient time to modify their trust agreements, the final regulations also retain the grace period of the proposed regulations that allows until December 31, 1996, for the inclusion of the required trust provisions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Dispositions of an Interest in a Nuclear Power Plant <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed regulations generally treat transfers of assets in Funds resulting from transfers of interests in nuclear power plants to which the Funds relate as nonrecognition, transferred basis transactions. Most of the comments favored the proposed rules. However, commentators requested (1) additional guidance on how to determine which Fund assets relate to a transferred interest in a nuclear power plant and clarification that the regulations were not adopting a tracing approach; (2) an option to treat these dispositions as triggering a taxable transfer of related assets; (3) an option to transfer an entire Fund rather than the assets in the Fund; and (4) assurance that the proposed rules apply in the context of corporate reorganizations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> First, to make clear that the regulations do not adopt a tracing approach, the final regulations refer to assets in a Fund that are proportionate to the interest in the plant that is transferred, rather than to assets that ``relate'' to the interest transferred. The final regulations also clarify that a proportionate amount of the assets in a Fund is considered transferred if, on the date the qualifying interest is transferred, the percentage of the aggregate fair market value of the assets transferred equals the percentage of the qualifying interest transferred. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, the final regulations do not adopt the suggestion to provide taxpayers with an option to treat the disposition as triggering a taxable transfer of a proportionate amount of the assets. The nonrecognition, transferred basis approach simplifies the tax rules for dispositions and corresponds to the substance of these transactions. Permitting taxpayers to elect taxable treatment would unnecessarily complicate the tax rules. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Third, to minimize the role of form in these disposition transactions, the final regulations clarify that when an interest in a nuclear power plant is transferred, the associated assets must be transferred to a Fund of the transferee or, if the transferee acquires the transferor's entire interest in the plant, the transferor's Fund may be transferred to the transferee. Such a transfer of the transferor's Fund must not be prohibited by the transferor's trust agreement or applicable local law. Regardless of whether the assets of the transferor's Fund or the Fund itself is transferred, after the transfer, the transferee must not violate &sect;1.468A&hyph;5(a)(1)(ii), which requires that an electing taxpayer maintain only one Fund for each nuclear power plant. Similarly, after the transfer, the transferee and the transferor that retains an interest must not violate &sect;1.468A&hyph;5(a)(1)(ii), which requires that each electing taxpayer have a separate Fund for its interest in the same plant. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / International Company News: PepsiCo buys into Hungary PEPSICO, the US food and drink group, yesterday acquired FAU, a leading Hungarian soft drink company, and said it would invest Dollars 115m in the Budapest area over the next five years. The US group took a 79 per cent interest for an undisclosed sum in FAU, which had previously produced Pepsi products under licence for the Budapest area. This is the first time that Pepsi has taken an equity stake in one of the bottlers and distributors of its products in eastern Europe. The acquisition of FAU's four plants is part of the broader drive by Pepsi to regain market leadership in Hungary from Coca-Cola and maintain its position in eastern Europe ahead of its rival. Pepsi plans to increase production capacity and boost output of soft drinks in plastic bottles. Pepsi said yesterday it was also interested in acquiring the state-owned Pepsi franchise operations in Hungarian regions outside Budapest. Pepsi's plans for Hungary are part of a wider investment in eastern Europe amounting to 'close to Dollars 1bn', according to Mr David Jones, president of Pepsi-Cola International's Eastern Europe division.</p>

			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / World Trade News: European yarn output falls 10% THE Pounds 13bn-a-year European textile industry slid further into recession in the third quarter of 1991 and further behind the rest of the world, the International Textile Manufacturers' Federation (ITMF) said yesterday. Yarn production fell almost 10 per cent and fabric output 8 per cent from the previous year. For the whole world, however, yarn production for the quarter was 1.5 per cent higher. Asian output rose more than 5 per cent, and changes ranged from a 24 per cent drop in the UK to a 17 per cent increase in Pakistan. ITMF figures cover cotton and artificial fibre spinning and weaving. They exclude other natural fibres, such as wool and silk, as well as clothing manufacture. Third-quarter world fabric production was 2 per cent lower than in 1990. Among the losers, Spain showed a 10 per cent drop, Switzerland 26 per cent, and Turkey and Britain both 12 per cent. Pakistan registered an increase of 17 per cent, the ITMF said.</p>

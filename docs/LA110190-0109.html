			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POLANSKI CAN DEFEND HIMSELF IN SEX CASE  </P> <P> The California Supreme Court Wednesday ruled that movie director Roman Polanski  may defend himself against a civil suit by the 13-year-old girl he sexually  assaulted in 1977, even though Polanski fled to France before sentencing.  </P> <P> The victim, now 26 and living in Hawaii, filed a civil suit against Polanski  stemming from the unlawful sex in 1977.  </P> <P> She argued that Polanski forfeited the right to defend himself in court against  her claim because he fled the country and never faced sentencing.  </P> <P> The high court rejected the argument and refused to hear an appeal in the case.  </P> <P> Polanski currently lives as a fugitive in Paris and continues to make movies.  </P> <P> The young woman is identified only by the name "Jane Doe" on the court  documents.  </P> <P> Polanski pleaded guilty in August, 1977, to unlawful sexual intercourse with a  minor in an incident that took place at the home of actor Jack Nicholson.  </P></p>

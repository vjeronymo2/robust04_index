			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / Treasury makes big cut in gilts funding needs The government yesterday announced a substantial Pounds 5bn downward revision in the volume of gilt-edged securities that it will need to sell in this financial year even though it is cutting only slightly its forecast for the public sector borrowing requirement. In its summer economic forecast, the Treasury envisages a PSBR of Pounds 36.1bn, equivalent to 5 1/4 per cent of gross domestic product, for the year to the end of March 1995 compared with Pounds 38bn forecast in the November 1993 Budget. But sales of gilts will have to total only about Pounds 32bn in 1994-95 to meet the objective of fully funding the deficit compared with an estimate in March this year of gilt sales of Pounds 37bn. Of the Pounds 32bn, the Bank of England has already sold gilts worth Pounds 4.55bn since the beginning of April. To arrive at the Pounds 32bn, the Treasury said it has carried over a cumulative overfund of the 1993-94 deficit that it estimates at Pounds 2 1/4 bn. Against this, some Pounds 8 1/2 bn of gilts are expected to mature in 1994-95. With foreign currency reserves assumed to stay unchanged on balance, the overall funding requirement for the current financial year is forecast at about Pounds 42bn compared with Pounds 47bn three months ago. National Savings are expected to contribute about Pounds 3 1/2 bn towards funding the deficit while a further Pounds 6.8bn of gilt-edged securities sold to banks and building societies in 1992-93 will be counted towards funding before the end of this financial year. The government expects a further improvement in the UK's public finances in 1995-96. The PSBR for the coming financial year is now forecast at Pounds 27.9bn compared with the Pounds 30bn forecast in the November Budget. If the 1995-96 target is met, the PSBR will have fallen to 4 per cent of GDP from 7 1/4 per cent in 1993-94, when the deficit totalled Pounds 46bn. The Pounds 2bn improvement now expected in the 1994-95 PSBR mainly reflects a Pounds 1.9bn increase in revenues expected this year. The principal change is an expected Pounds 1 1/4 bn increase in corporation tax receipts compared with the Budget forecast, which largely reflects better than expected profits in 1993. The Treasury said yesterday that its forecasts for income tax and value added tax are also higher than in the Budget, but these are offset partly by downward revisions to the forecast receipts from petroleum revenue tax, excise duties, business rates and capital gains tax. Although unemployment has fallen more sharply than expected in last November's Budget, the government expects only a modest Pounds  1/4 bn decline in cyclical social security payments in the current financial year compared with earlier forecasts. Improved privatisation proceeds are expected to play an important role in reducing the PSBR for 1995-96. The government now expects that sales of electricity company debt and equity will boost privatisation income to Pounds 2 1/2 bn in the coming financial year from Pounds 1bn predicted in the November Budget. The government's PSBR projections could be overturned by any changes to existing tax and spending plans in the Budget on November 29 this year. At present, however, the Treasury envisages that tax as a share of GDP will increase sharply to 37 per cent by the end of 1995-96 from about 34 per cent in 1993-94.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- PSBR by sector (Pounds bn)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                                                    1993-94   1994-95                                        Budget  Provisional  Forecast                                      forecast     outturn  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Central government on cash basis   Receipts:   Inland Revenue****                     76.9        77.0       88.5   Customs and Excise****                 66.9        66.9       73.8   Soc sec contributions (GB)             37.1        36.9       41.7   Interest and dividends                  9.1         9.3        8.7   Other                                  18.4        18.8       19.5  ---------------------------------------------------------------------   Total receipts                        208.4       209.0      232.2  ---------------------------------------------------------------------   Outlays:   Interest payments                      18.8        18.8       21.7   Privatisation proceeds                 -5.4        -5.4       -5.5   Net departmental outlays              245.2       243.4      254.2  ---------------------------------------------------------------------   Total outlays                         258.6       256.9      270.4  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Central government borrowing requirement*                   50.2        47.9       38.1 Local authority borrowing requirement    -0.8        -2.8       -1.0 Public corporations' borrowing requirement                     0.4         0.9       -1.0 Public sector borrowing requirement      49.8        46.0       36.1  --------------------------------------------------------------------- ****Payments to the Consolidated Fund *Own account borrowing; excludes net lending to local authorities and public corporations  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

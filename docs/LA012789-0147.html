The youths ignored the officer's attempt to stop them, drove west on  Warner Avenue and headed north on the San Diego Freeway, Thomas added.  </P> <P> After a high-speed, 30-minute chase, the car spun out of control on Century  Boulevard after leaving the freeway. No one was injured, and the car was not  damaged. The youths, ages 15 and 16 and both from Santa Ana, were arrested on  suspicion of possession of stolen property, evading arrest and reckless  driving.  </P></p>

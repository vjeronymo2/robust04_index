			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Nikolay Geronin and Vladimir </F> Solntsev]    [Text] Moscow June 2 TASS -- Russia should mount pressure  on North Korea to observe the nuclear non-proliferation regime,  according to Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the State Duma  Committee on International Affairs, who, however, did not say  directly whether sanctions should be imposed on Pyongyang.    "Our attitude to the problem of nuclear armaments of any  state is resolutely negative. Surely, it is better to reach an  agreement than impose sanctions, but the non-proliferation  regime should be maintained very strictly", he told TASS on  Thursday.    Lukin, who participated in Russian-South Korean talks on  Thursday, said that "Russia is especially not interested in the  appearance of new nuclear states on its borders" and added that  it is necessary to hold a dialogue with Pyongyang when possible.    If the dialogue fails "then those countries which do not  want  to abide by international and even their own decisions should be  convinced more resolutely", he said.</p>

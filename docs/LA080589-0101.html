			<p><P> August 5, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> The wounding of a Point Loma man armed with a shotgun in May by a San Diego  police officer answering a domestic disturbance call was legally justified, the  district attorney's office announced Friday.  </P> <P> "It was either shoot or be shot," said a report issued by District Atty. Edwin  Miller.  </P> <P> Nels S. Peterson, was shot in the right shoulder May 19 by Officer Anthony  Castellini at a house in the 4400 block of Greene Street, police spokesman Bill  Robinson said.  </P> <P> Peterson's wife had called police to report that her husband was acting abusive  and was possibly on drugs, police said. After police arrived, Peterson ran to  an upstairs room and came out with a 12-gauge shotgun, which he pointed in  Castellini's direction, Robinson said.  </P> <P> Castellini fired once from his 9-millimeter pistol, Robinson said. A blood test  revealed that Peterson had methamphetamine and amphetamine in his system,  according to Miller. Peterson is being held in County Jail downtown on  suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon on a police officer, Robinson said.  </P></p>

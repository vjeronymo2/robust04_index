			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / International Company News: Australian airline close to stalling Australia Air, the only potential new Australian international airline to emerge since the country the start of a competitive, deregulated aviation market looks set to abandon its efforts to take to the skies, writes Nikki Tait. The fledgling company has admitted that it has little hope of raising the necessary start-up capital via a stock market flotation. Since a portion of its equity funding must come from within Australia, the only remaining hope is that a domestic investor steps forward. Given that Australia Air has been searching for capital for months, this seems unlikely. Australia Air was awarded rights to fly between Australia and China in March last year.</p>

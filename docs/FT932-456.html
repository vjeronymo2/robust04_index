			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / Axing Thorp could cost Pounds 5bn, Eggar warns COMPENSATION to power utilities could amount to Pounds 5bn if the UK abandoned Thorp, the controversial nuclear reprocessing plant at Sellafield, Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, told MPs yesterday. But as the government threw its weight behind the Pounds 2.8bn plant in yesterday's House of Commons debate, it also announced a further round of public consultation on Thorp, delaying a final decision on its future until late autumn. The government's assessment could be complicated by the publication yesterday of a long-awaited report from a government advisory committee which argues that British Nuclear Fuels has not adequately explained its plans to store foreign waste in the UK permanently. The Radioactive Waste Management Advisory committee said there were many questions still to be answered about BNF's proposed policy of 'substitution'. Under this plan, bulky low-level and intermediate-level waste produced by Thorp will be stored permanently in Britain while BNF would return to customers a smaller amount of high-level waste equivalent in terms of radioactivity. 'The profitability of Thorp would be considerably enhanced if substitution were to be accepted,' the report says. If the government followed the committee's recommendations, that could add months more to a debate about licensing the plant. BNF's plant, which environmentalists have dubbed Britain's biggest white elephant, is waiting for a licence from the Department of the Environment to start operation. The company has warned that further delay could force it to shed staff to help cut costs of Pounds 2.4m a week. Mr Eggar attacked a Liberal Democrat proposal yesterday for a fuller public inquiry into Thorp, saying it would lead to 'a loss of confidence' by overseas investors who have funded much of the plant's construction. A number of Thorp's customers had 'shown interest' in signing additional contracts beyond the initial 10 years, he suggested. Mr Simon Hughes, Liberal Democrat environment spokesman, said there was growing concern about proliferation of uranium and plutonium produced by reprocessing. The government's proposed 10-week consultation will begin in late July with the publication of a report setting out the case for the plant. The attorney-general told the government last month it ran the risk of a judicial review prompted by legal action from pressure groups if it did not consider the wider issues. Mr Chris Smith, a Labour frontbench environment spokesman, yesterday accused the government of prejudging its own consultation. Ministers were saying 'we have made up our mind but we are going to consult because legally we have to be seen to do so', he said. Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, said yesterday that the public consultation, the second on the plant, would look at the wider economic and political justification for it, but environmental factors had been adequately addressed by the pollution inspectorate's report on the first public consultation. Thorp is designed to extract reusable uranium and plutonium from used or spent nuclear fuel, leaving less true waste. BNF's contracts allow it return all reprocessed material to foreign customers. The committee is concerned that BNF has not yet agreed the details of substitution with its foreign customers, mainly Japanese and German nuclear power utilities. It adds that substitution could be threatened if the nuclear industry's proposal to build an underground store for radioactive waste deep under Sellafield is delayed. BNF said last night: 'We are considering the government's statement.' It intends to reply today. Lex, Page 16</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On March 9, 1994, EPA announced its proposed approval of the Pagosa Springs, Colorado moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area SIP as meeting those moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area requirements due on November 15, 1991 (see 59 FR 11012&hyph;11018). EPA also announced in that  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice its proposed approval of the PM&hyph;10 contingency measures for Pagosa Springs as meeting the requirements of section 172(c)(9) of the Act due on November 15, 1993. In that proposed rulemaking action and related Technical Support Document (TSD), EPA described in detail its interpretations of title I and its rationale for proposing to approve the Pagosa Springs moderate nonattainment area PM&hyph;10 SIP and PM&hyph;10 contingency measures, taking into consideration the specific factual issues presented. EPA requested public comments on all aspects of the proposed rulemaking pertaining to Pagosa Springs (see 59 FR 11017). No comments were received on the proposed rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> This Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 110(k) of the Act sets out provisions governing EPA's review of SIP submittals (see 57 FR 13565&hyph;13566). On February 24, 1993 and on December 9, 1993, the Governor of Colorado submitted revisions to the SIP which were intended to satisfy those moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area SIP requirements due for Pagosa Springs on November 15, 1991 and the PM&hyph;10 contingency measure requirements of section 172(c)(9) of the Act due on November 15, 1993. As described in EPA's proposed approval of these SIP submittals, the Pagosa Springs moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area plan includes, among other things: (1) A comprehensive and accurate emissions inventory; (2) control measures that satisfy the RACM requirement; (3) a demonstration (including air quality modeling) that attainment of the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS will be achieved in Pagosa Springs by December 31, 1994 and maintained through December 31, 1997; (4) provisions for meeting the November 15, 1994 quantitative milestone and RFP requirements; (5) enforceability documentation; and (6) control measures that satisfy the contingency measures requirement of section 172(c)(9) of the Act. Further, EPA proposed to determine that major sources of precursors of PM&hyph;10 do not contribute significantly to PM&hyph;10 levels in excess of the NAAQS in Pagosa Springs. Lastly, EPA proposed to amend the Pagosa Springs moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area boundary to include some of the surrounding suburban area of Pagosa Springs based on a SIP equivalent demonstration submitted by the State which showed that the revised boundary more accurately represents the Pagosa Springs airshed. Please refer to EPA's notice of proposed rulemaking (59 FR 11012) and the TSD for that action for a more detailed discussion of these elements of the Pagosa Springs plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In this final rulemaking, EPA announces its approval of those elements of the Pagosa Springs, Colorado moderate nonattainment area PM&hyph;10 SIP that were due on November 15, 1991 and submitted on February 24, 1993 and December 9, 1993, as well as the PM&hyph;10 contingency measures that were due on November 15, 1993 and submitted on December 9, 1993. In this final action, EPA is also announcing its approval of section I. of the Colorado Regulation entitled ``Nonattainment Areas,'' which contains the PM&hyph;10 control measures and contingency measures for the Pagosa Springs moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA finds that the State of Colorado's PM&hyph;10 SIP for the Pagosa Springs moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area meets the Reasonably Available Control Measures (RACM), including Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT), requirement. One source category was identified as the major contributor to the PM&hyph;10 nonattainment problem in Pagosa Springs and, therefore, was targeted for control in the SIP. The State has demonstrated that, by applying control measures to the area source of re-entrained road dust from paved roads, Pagosa Springs will be in attainment by December 31, 1994. It does not appear that applying further control measures to these or other sources would expedite attainment. EPA views the following measures as reasonable, enforceable, and responsible for significant PM&hyph;10 emissions reductions in Pagosa Springs: (1) Section I.C. of the State regulation entitled ``Nonattainment Areas,'' which limits the percent fines to 1 percent in any street sanding material used on the major State highways in the Pagosa Springs moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area; and (2) Section I.D. of the State regulation entitled ``Nonattainment Areas,'' which requires a reduction in the amount of street sanding material applied on the major State highways in the nonattainment area by 10 percent beginning 12/93 and by an additional 5 percent (or a total of 15 percent) beginning 12/95. Further, although no credit was claimed in the SIP, EPA is approving the following measure to make it Federally enforceable and to further strengthen the SIP: Section I.B. of the State regulation entitled ``Nonattainment Areas,'' which requires 6 miles of unpaved gravel roads in the Town of Pagosa Springs to be paved. EPA is also approving Section I.A. of the ``Nonattainment Area'' regulation, which includes a definition of terms used in the other sections of the regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Beware of Greeks baring teeth Michael Jurassic Park Crichton is going round telling people that news- papers are mediasaurs, doomed to be swept into a ditch as the mediafuture dawns. Perhaps he is right. Everywhere, it is said, newspaper readerships are falling (the young watch TV) and advertising revenues declining with the pssphhhh of released air. But let it not be alleged that Hawks &amp; Handsaws is getting lost in the clouds, dreamily expiring. It is right in there, at the titanium-hard cutting edge of mediaworld. In no way or wit is H &amp; H flummoxed by the latest concepts or sexy media jargon. Communicopia. Global teleputing. Audiotext. Database management. Facsi- mile-on-demand. Interactivity. Interactivity - based on a merging of traditional newspaper techniques, TV systems, super-computers and telephony - is where H &amp; H is at. I have tried to keep it secret, but H &amp; H has been fully interactive, sparklingly on-line, for several weeks, part of a study being conducted by MIT and some nerds in Silicon Valley. My working day is lengthening. Readers are talking back. Even minor characters mentioned only hurriedly are getting on to me in real time. Yesterday I was tapping away when the story suddenly filed itself into the T-Noel basket and the face of Georgios the biker flashed on to my screen from a mobile TV studio stationed, he explained, in the village of Phigaleia, Greece. Georgios the biker made a two-line appearance in a book review of mine in last Saturday's FT. He had made a longer appearance in the book under review: The Pan Principle, Fiona Pitt-Kethley's account of travels in Greece, looking for traces of Pan. She did not find Pan, but she found plenty of Greeks, with some of whom she enjoyed, as the review drily noted, congressional episodes. One of these episodes was with Georgios the biker. It was not satisfactory. Georgios proved a thug, and bit Pitt- Kethley violently, through the silk of her jersey. Two crescents of bruising lasted a week. Now he was on my screen. Georgios the biker. Speaking to me in real time. Not a happy man. Reasonably good- looking. Hair round his collar. Forehead invisible. Virile, no doubt. I asked, rather sharply: 'What do you want, Georgios?' I assumed he would berate me about his appearance in the book review, or even in the book. But that was not why he was calling. 'Sure I picked her up,' he said, referring to Pitt-Kethley. 'What a silly woman. I expect the book was boring. But what I'm calling to ask is why you so hate foreigners. French. German. Greek. Especially you hate the Greek. On 16/1/94 you wrote about the Elgin Marbles. You joked about the Marbles, and about Macedonia. 'You knew what you were doing. Just stirring-up. Hateful. Insulting. Who you think you are? On 18/12/93 you were rude about the French. Arrogant, you called them. Described a row in Paris in which you shouted at a Frenchman because he nearly hit your Rover with his 'lemon-coloured' Citroen - I bet you make that up - and did not speak the English. Said the French were stupid, and should all learn to speak the English. More stirring-up. Gratuitous. Twerpish. Why you bother to do it? Maybe I bite you.' 'Look, Georgios,' I said. 'You have to allow for artistic licence. On 29/1/94 I appeared to be rude about people who live in Kent, part of southern England. I was discussing the Channel Tunnel, and its high-speed rail connection between London and the coast. Many people in Kent are angry with the route of this rail-line. So I said: 'People who live in Kent are a selfish and common sort, so they can shut up.' But of course I did not mean that. 'You have to distinguish, Georgios, between the surface meaning of the words and the meaning underneath. In pretending to write rudely about people who live in Kent, I was really expressing my admiration for the Channel Tunnel, and for all feats of macro-engineering, which I happen to find exciting. For example, the Parthenon and its Marbles.' Unfortunately, mention of the Marbles triggered a stormy reaction in Georgios the biker. His black brows knitted furiously. Spittle shot at my screen. 'I'll catch you,' he screamed. 'And then I'll really bite you.'</p>

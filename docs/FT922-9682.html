			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Leading Article: Dip below the German line IN TURBULENT times, human beings naturally cling to apparent certainties. That no member of the European exchange rate mechanism shall have lower interest rates than Germany appears to have assumed law-like status in UK government circles, unchallenged save by the foolhardy. But there is no necessary connection between the ERM and a German interest rate floor; merely, as the philosopher David Hume might have remarked, an impression created by recent history. The UK should put this point to the test. Yesterday's welcome half a percentage point interest rate cut still leaves UK rates in double figures and there are few signs that anything other than a very half-hearted recovery is under way. The easing of UK monetary policy over the past 18 months has been modest compared with that in the US, Canada or Australia, which have had similar recessions. Yet the discipline of the ERM appears to rule out further cuts. The UK short-term interest rate differential with Germany has now narrowed to a mere quarter of a percentage point. No ERM country has managed to sustain lower rates than Germany without its exchange rate breaking through the bottom of its permitted bands and so requiring higher interest rates. The UK, if the Treasury is to be believed, is not about to follow the French example of last year and cut rates below Germany's only to beat a hasty and ignominious retreat. The outbreak of pay-related strikes in Germany, and the rapid growth of the Bundesbank's treasured monetary aggregates, suggest that German interest rates will keep the floor high for some months yet. Claim undermined But is it not possible that the very events which are keeping German interest rates high are also undermining Germany's claim to be Europe's model of anti-inflationary rectitude? Germany has maintained lower interest rates in the past because of the Bundesbank's impressive record. But the inflationary hang-over from German unification has dented Germany's credibility. West German workers do not want to pay for the reconstruction of east Germany by moderating their pay claims, hence last year's rise in wage inflation, and this year's strikes. The Bundesbank's credibility depends on whether it, and the government, are willing to stand firm against these wage demands. If the government does yield in the face of popular unrest, as it may, and the Bundesbank accommodates the pay increases by permitting a burst of inflation, which it just might, then its reputation will be damaged. Mr Major's finest hour might be at hand: with five years of Conservative government in store, and lower headline inflation than in Germany, what better government to lead a cut in European interest rates? Superficial arguments The UK Treasury will be right to resist these superficial arguments. The anti-inflation constituency in Germany remains strong, and the Bundesbank Council may well sanction a further rise in rates, however internationally embarrassing for Mr Kohl or, indeed, Mr Schlesinger. Even at the top of its boom, Germany still has lower underlying inflation than post-recession Britain. UK wage inflation must fall, and soon, before the UK can style itself a low-inflation country. Yet there is another reason, unrelated to Germany's current troubles, why the UK could cut its interest rates again: its wide ERM bands. If the UK were to cut its short rates below those in Germany, sterling might slip towards the bottom of its bands. But the fact that sterling could conceivably appreciate by 12.7 per cent, from the bottom to the top, might well be enough to persuade investors that lower UK rates were worth the gamble. The UK could not maintain this expectation indefinitely, and it would do nothing to ease long interest rates, but it might keep short rates lower for a while. In short, the UK should cut interest rates again soon and enjoy its wide ERM bands rather than ditching them in some misplaced act of Eurocommitment ahead of its presidency of the EC. So long as inflation remains on a downward path, this will be the right approach, even if it does raise the risk of having to raise interest rates again if sterling plummets. The rest of northern Europe will just have to wait.</p>

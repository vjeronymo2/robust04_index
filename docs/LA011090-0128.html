			<p><P> January 10, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STATE COMMISSION APPROVES FINE OF $4,000 FOR CAMPBELL  </P> <P> The Fair Political Practices Commission voted 3 to 2 Tuesday to approve a  previously reported agreement under which former state Sen. William Campbell  (R-Hacienda Heights) will pay a $4,000 fine for failing to report $30,700 in  late campaign contributions to his 1986 state controller's campaign.  </P> <P> Campbell retired from the Senate last month and is now president of the  California Manufacturers Assn., a powerful trade and lobby group.  </P> <P> The settlement does not affect other ongoing FPPC investigations into  allegations that Campbell and his top aide, Jerome M. Haleva, failed to report  a gift and that Haleva failed to report as a gift a below-market interest rate  he received on a $20,000 personal loan.  </P></p>

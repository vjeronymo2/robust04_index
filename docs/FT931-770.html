			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / The horror of dead children: Dominic Lawson asks why the deaths of two boys have produced such outrage 'PUT THE IRA UP AGAINST A WALL THEN SHOOT THEM', was the message, in letters two inches high, on Tuesday's front page of Britain's most popular newspaper. The Ulster Freedom Fighters are clearly diligent readers of The Sun. Within 12 hours of the order to kill from Wapping High Command, the Protestant terrorists had murdered four Roman Catholics, in Castlerock, Co Londonderry. The Sun was right in one respect at least. It prefaced 'Put the IRA up against a wall then shoot them' with the slogan 'The Sun speaks out for Britain.' While such sentiments were not expressed in the House of Commons, or indeed in any other newspaper, we can be confident that in the pubs and housing estates of Britain the 'put the bastards up against a wall' argument outweighed all others. The Sun's extraordinary success is based on its consistent ability to express what most British people feel, and in demotic language. The particular rage caused by the IRA's murders in Warrington is for this reason: the two victims were children - one three, the other 12. The murder of children still horrifies in an age sated with horrors. The popular reaction to the murder last month of another three-year-old, James Bulger, was a clear sign that we regard the murder of a child as intrinsically different, and intrinsically more evil, than the murder of an adult. It is not more evil, and it is not necessarily worse. I cannot see that the murders, by bomb blast, of Jonathan Ball and Timothy Parry were more horrifying or more evil than the shooting down, in the coldest of cold blood, of James McKenna, Robert Dalrymple, Noel O'Kane and Dee Walsh. All these men were British citizens as entitled as any of us to the protection of the law and the state. The popular outrage at the murder of children is linked to the idea that they are 'innocent' in a way that adults are not. Leaving aside the now highly unfashionable Christian doctrine of original sin, such arguments still seem tendentious, suggesting that the greater number of misdemeanours that an adult will have committed somehow makes the sudden extinguishing of his life by violence easier to balance in the scales of justice. In many ways, the death of an adult is a far more damaging thing than the death of a child. The death of a mother, for example, destroys a family completely. The death of a father is scarcely less devastating. This truth, horrible as it is, is one appreciated in the famine zones of Africa. Those who have worked for aid teams there have reported that children are generally left to starve before the adults. This is not because of lack of love, still less callousness, on the part of the parents. It is just that those parents know that they, and they alone, can create the family anew, by producing more children. Without the parents, the whole family would soon be scattered and extinguished. One should not blame The Sun for not pointing all this out. Its job is not to teach its readers philosophy or even biology. But one can perhaps lob a few verbal bombs in the direction of the Irish government, which has reacted to the murders of the two children in Warrington with unusual concern, offering to send an envoy to their funerals. Let their envoys stay at home. Let them instead remove from their constitution the clause, so encouraging to the IRA, which demands the annexation of Northern Ireland. Let them instead give support, not obstruction, to British forces attempting to control the border movements of the IRA. Otherwise they might find a British government following The Sun's Northern Ireland policy. Dominic Lawson is editor of The Spectator</p>

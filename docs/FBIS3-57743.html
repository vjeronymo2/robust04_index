First Deputy Speaker Vyacheslav Kuznetsov told the  parliament  on Friday [28 January] that the three are Mechislaw Hryb,  chairman of the parliamentary commission on national security,  defence and anti-crime fight, Mikhail Marynych, deputy chairman  of the state committee on foreign economic relations, and  lawmaker Viktar Hanchar. Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich  refused to vie the post.    Hryb and Marynych were nominated by the presidium of the  parliament which held a meeting on Thursday and which was  attended by Kebich and heads of republic's regions.    The presidium also nominated three other candidates --  Nikolay Voytenkov, head of the Gomel region, Viktor Danilenko,  the ambassador in Russia, and Vladimir Rusakevich, deputy head  of the Brest region. However, the three immediately announced  that they quit the race.    Hanchar was nominated by Aleksandr Lukashenko who initiated  the no-confidence vote to former speaker Stanislav Shushkevich.    Other candidates nominated by lawmakers included Prime  Minister Vyacheslav Kebich, Chairman of the Party of Popular  Accord Gennadiy Karpenko and Ambassador in Latvia Valentin  Velichko. However, they all withdrew themselves from the list.</p>

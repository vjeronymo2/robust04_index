			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / Pipeline may supply gas to Belgium MR TIM EGGAR, energy minister, is expected to announce in the Commons today the publication of a prospectus for the Pounds 300m gas pipe project between the UK and the Continent. A group of companies including British Gas, British Petroleum and Norway's Statoil have been involved in an initial feasibility study which could involve the export of UK gas to continental Europe. Mr Eggar will refer to the prospectus in a parliamentary answer. It should set out details of the so-called Europipe venture in an effort to gauge the amount of interest among energy companies for the private-sector project. A steering committee of seven companies involved in the initial technical studies is considering a plan to build a pipeline between Bacton, in Norfolk, and Zeebrugge in Belgium, with export capacity of 15bn cu m a year, or a third of current UK output. However, companies are not sure of the commercial viability of such a scheme. Statoil said yesterday it had not yet decided whether to participate in the project. Mr Eggar is understood to have told the companies involved that the UK government is ready to negotiate a treaty with the Belgian authorities about the proposed Europipe linking up with the Belgian national grid. The government is keen for the Europipe project to go ahead and is linking the success of the venture to a decision to allow additional supplies of Norwegian gas to flow into the UK. But there has been some scepticism about the viability of the planned project because it is unlikely the gas could compete with lower-cost supplies from Russia. Other companies involved in the plan include Norsk Hydro, the Norwegian resources group, Elf Aquitaine, France's energy group, Conoco UK and Distrigaz of Belgium.</p>

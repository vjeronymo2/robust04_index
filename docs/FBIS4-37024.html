			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 16 Jun (TANJUG) -- Milorad Unkovic, federal  minister for foreign economic relations, arrived in Baghdad this  morning. He is heading a Yugoslav delegation during its  official visit to Iraq at the invitation of the Iraqi  Government. In the course of his visit, scheduled to end on  Monday, Unkovic will meet a number of high-ranking Iraqi  officials.    He is expected to discuss bilateral relations and  particularly economic problems and outstanding debts owed to  Yugoslav companies which have for years been involved in  construction projects. The projects and the payments for them  were suspended after Iraqi troops entered Kuwait in August 1991.</p>

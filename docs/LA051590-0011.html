			<p><P> May 15, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD  </P> <P> What the Lakers need to do to come back and win the series from Phoenix:  </P> <P> Acquire Patrick Ewing. . . .  </P> <P> Get 135 minutes from Magic Johnson just like the 45 he played in Phoenix  Sunday. . . .  </P> <P> Have Cotton Fitzsimmons say something nasty about them. . . .  </P> <P> Play Laker basketball instead of Laker team handball. . . .  </P> <P> Bring back Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to give Vlade Divac a crash course in the sky  hook. . . .  </P> <P> Get Mark West to play like Mark West. . . .  </P> <P> Trade the rights to Dancing Barry and cash to the Suns for the Gorilla. . . .  </P> <P> Collect as many floor burns as Kurt Rambis and Dan Majerle. . . .  </P> <P> Have Pat Riley coach like the coach of the year that he finally is. . . .  </P> <P> Get Jeff Hornacek to play like Jeff Hornacek. . . .  </P> <P> Remind James Worthy that he has to be more consistent in May to become Mr.  June. . . .  </P> <P> Look at the films of Game 4 and notice that A.C. Green was the game's leading  rebounder although he could hardly make it up and down the court in the second  half. . . .  </P> <P> Get Byron Scott to play like Byron Scott. . . .  </P> <P> Don't allow Kevin Johnson to drive in the diamond lane most of the time. . . .  </P> <P> Win at least three consecutive games for the 14th time this season. . . .  </P> <P> From Oakland Athletic second baseman Mike Gallego after the trade with the  Dodgers for Willie Randolph: "It's going to be tougher for me to get a good  table at a restaurant now, saying, 'I'm Mike Gallego, extra infielder.' " . . .  </P> <P> No matter how many players he loses, Bob Rodgers always seems to have the  Montreal Expos playing respectable baseball. . . .  </P> <P> It came as no great surprise to those who saw him pitch with the Dodgers that  Matt Young tied a Seattle Mariners' record with three wild pitches Sunday. . .  .  </P> <P> Recently retired major league stars played a nine-inning game in Las Vegas  Saturday that was taped by NBC, and now there's talk of a tour to include  Hawaii and Europe. . . .  </P> <P> Glad they've slowed down the Indy cars so much that a mere 225.301 m.p.h.  average was good enough to win the provisional pole. . . .  </P> <P> You've got to be a horse racing buff to know that the Preakness is contested at  the distance of 1 3/16 miles. . . .  </P> <P> Cotton Fitzsimmons keeps saying Phoenix winning the series from the Lakers  would be the biggest upset in NBA history.  </P> <P> Probably not. The Lakers were 6-1 favorites over the Suns at the Barbary Coast  Sports Book in Las Vegas. . . .  </P> <P> This is beginning to look like the year the Detroit Pistons prove their  greatness. . . .  </P> <P> Illegal defense rules should be ruled illegal. . . .  </P> <P> No member of the NBA all-rookie first team -- David Robinson, Tim Hardaway,  Vlade Divac, Sherman Douglas or Pooh Richardson -- was drafted higher than 10th  in the first round last year. Of course, Robinson was the first choice in 1987.  . . .  </P> <P> What's the first thing Columbo does in the morning? Peter Falk says he reads  the New York Knicks' box score. . . .  </P> <P> B.J. Armstrong looks young enough to be the Chicago Bulls' ballboy. . . .  </P> <P> Being coach of a championship team doesn't guarantee a good TV commentator.  Chuck Daly should check with Bill Walsh. . . .  </P> <P> UCLA, that well-known soccer factory, leads the nation with four current or  former players selected to the U.S. team for the World Cup. . . .  </P> <P> Terry Donahue is among several football and basketball coaches who are  discussing the state of intercollegiate athletes with the Knight-Ridder  commission in Washington. . . .  </P> <P> Harness racing owner Len Corbosiero claims night thoroughbred racing at  Hollywood Park eventually would kill Los Alamitos. . . .  </P> <P> Ed O'Bannon, who recently said he will attend Nevada Las Vegas, will appear in  the California Fabulous 44 Prep Basketball Classic June 24 at UC Irvine. . . .  </P> <P> Surest thing about the Jack-in-the-Box Invitational Sunday at Drake Stadium is  that Steve Scott will run the mile in under four minutes for the 127th time. .  . .  </P> <P> Don't expect Mike Tyson and George Foreman to fight one another after they  dispose of their opponents next month. Another doubleheader is in the works. .  . .  </P> <P> So much for the home-court advantage in tennis now that Boris Becker has lost  the German Open. . . .  </P> <P> Does Edmonton's advancing to the Stanley Cup championship series justify the  trade of Wayne Gretzky to the Kings two years ago? Not really. I have a feeling  the Oilers would have made it to the finals even with Gretzky in their lineup.  </P></p>

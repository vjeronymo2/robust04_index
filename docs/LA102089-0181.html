Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> COLOMBIA JUDGES END STRIKE  </P> <P> Judges today ended a three-day strike for safety from drug barons, but they  said that their demands were not met and that they have not received any of the  $19 million in security aid promised by Washington.  </P> <P> The judges threatened to strike again if the government does not provide  bulletproof vests, bulletproof cars and bodyguards.  </P> <P> "The next strike will be longer, and the next one longer still," said federal  judge Consuelo Herrera, a director of the National Assn. of Court Workers.  </P> <P> U.S. officials have said an unspecified number of bulletproof vests were  delivered a month ago to the Colombian government.  </P> <P> Colombia's Justice Ministry was supposed to receive the aid, but secretaries  said no one was available for comment on the issue. No one returned telephone  calls.  </P></p>

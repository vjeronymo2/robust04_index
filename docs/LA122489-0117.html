			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CHILDREN FIND 'GHOST TOWN' WITH SPIRIT OF THE SEASON  </P> <P> During the first years of his life, Raul Mateos, 10, lived on a ranch in Mexico  near Jalisco. There, he said, he regularly rode horses and played in the  wide-open spaces.  </P> <P> Six years ago, his family moved to El Monte, east of Los Angeles, where he  lives in a crowded neighborhood near the freeway. His family has suffered from  the ravages of urban crime: Last year their house was burglarized.  </P> <P> But on Saturday, Raul relived a bit of his younger days. Under clear blue  skies, he petted horses and played cowboys and Indians on the dusty streets of  a rickety Western town.  </P> <P> He was one of more than 50 low-income children from the Head Start program,  some of whom are physically disabled, who came to Johnny Carpenter's Heaven on  Earth ranch in Lake View Terrace for an old Western Christmas party, complete  with a barbecue lunch, a generous Santa Claus who dispensed toys, and Christmas  carols in English and Spanish.  </P> <P> Carpenter, 75, is a crusty old cowboy who starred in such low-budget 1950s  Westerns as "Trail of Kit Carson," "In Old Wyoming," and "Santa Fe Saddle  Mates."  </P> <P> And for more than 50 years, Carpenter has entertained thousands of disabled and  disadvantaged children at his 3 1/2-acre lot, where he keeps several horses and  donkeys. He has also constructed a ghost town, complete with the Mangy Dog  Saloon, a post office and a stagecoach station.  </P> <P> Carpenter, who comes from a wealthy Arkansas family, developed the ranch so  that disabled and other disadvantaged children could play in the wide-open  spaces and interact with animals.  </P> <P> "A kid that hasn't played in the dirt -- it is physically impossible for him to  be normal," Carpenter said.  </P> <P> Over the years, by his own count, more than 750,000 children have visited the  ranch. Many have learned to ride horses on the property.  </P> <P> Mark Friedman, 23, of Studio City said he has been coming to the ranch since he  was 3 1/2. Friedman, who is deaf, was there Saturday, dressed in a Civil War  costume, to help Carpenter. He said he wanted to be sure the children had as  much fun as he had when he was young.  </P> <P> Carpenter said his efforts on behalf of the disabled are the fulfillment of a  promise he made while recuperating from a devastating auto accident when he was  18. Lying in bed with a broken back, a broken leg and a concussion, he vowed  that if he was ever able to walk again, he would dedicate his life to helping  the disabled. Carpenter recovered. The inspiration for the ranch came several  years later, when four blind men came to the stable where he worked and asked  Carpenter to teach them how to ride horses. At first, Carpenter was skeptical,  he said, but they persuaded him and eventually became adept riders. That's when  he decided to open a ranch for disabled and urban children, he said.  </P> <P> Lorraine Gutierrez, coordinator of the El Monte Options/Head Start program, who  organized the trip for the children and their parents, said many of the  children at the ranch Saturday had never been outside their immediate  neighborhood.  </P> <P> The children loved the games, gifts and lunch, but most said the best part of  the outing was the donkeys and horses.  </P> <P> "I got to pet the donkey," said Julia Franco, 4, as she sucked on a candy cane  and clutched a Barbie doll she had received from Santa Claus.  </P></p>

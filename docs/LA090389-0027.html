			<p><P> September 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A NEW FACE SHOWS HIS TRUE COLORS  </P> <P> The unadorned violence that South African security forces have unleashed on  peaceful anti-apartheid protesters in recent weeks is a reminder that, despite  all his talk about reform and negotiation, the priority of the country's new  leader, Frederik W. de Klerk, is the perpetuation of white-minority control.  </P> <P> De Klerk, a longtime National Party leader from conservative Transvaal  province, has worked diligently to provide apartheid with tempered rhetoric and  a smiling visage. He has sought to improve South Africa's international image  by traveling to neighboring countries and meeting with his counterparts  including, most recently, President Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia. Unfortunately, De  Klerk has yet to provide his unpopular regime with an alternative to violent  suppression of the aspirations of black South Africans.  </P> <P> Wednesday's parliamentary elections -- from which blacks, who constitute more  than 75% of the population, are excluded -- have provided the catalyst for  renewed mass protests throughout the country. This has suprised many  well-meaning people who hope that the National Party will win,presuming that De  Klerk would be more supportive of fundamental change than his predecessor. This  hope is, sadly, misplaced. Of all the potential successors to former President  Pieter W. Botha, none was more conservative than De Klerk. Those who have read  too much from his demeanor and vague statements and are moved to urge a  relaxation of the international pressure on South Africa overlook De Klerk's  long career, including his years as head of the interior and education  ministries.  </P> <P> The outcome of this week's election holds little relevance to the black people  of South Africa since the elections merely determine who gets the opportunity  to oppress them. The solicitude with which so many people discuss the present  electoral difficulties of De Klerk's party is disturbing, given its history in  matters of race and equality. It is certainly not too much to ask that more  concern be expressed for the worsening state of the victims of apartheid during  the current crackdown.  </P> <P> In order to gain favor with the white electorate, De Klerk has ordered one of  the severest crackdowns on protesters in recent history. Observers, including  foreign diplomats, have commented on the eagerness with which the police, using  tear gas, water hoses, whips, clubs and bullets, have moved to disperse and  disrupt peaceful demonstrations. There have been mass arrests conducted  violently without provocation. Archbishop Desmond Tutu was tear-gassed minutes  after he had persuaded youths to call off a march to a police station; on  Friday, he was arrested while en route to protest the beating of clergymen at  an earlier demonstration. The general secretary of the anti-apartheid United  Democratic Front, Mohammed Valli Moosa, Archbishop Tutu's wife, Leah, and  Dorothy Boesak, wife of UDF co-founder the Rev. Allan Boesak, are among others  who have been arrested. Several activists have gone underground, afraid not  only of arrest but also of assassination by vigilante groups.  </P> <P> The escalating repression has sparked criticism of De Klerk's policies from  many quarters. Curiously, the Bush Administration has not been one of them.  Though South Africa is experiencing a level of repression far exceeding  anything experienced by Solidarity in Poland, the Administration cannot find  the courage to chastise the South African regime. Indeed, even the limited  response by the Administration to the crushing of the democratic movement in  China has been missing in this case.  </P> <P> In light of such silence by our chief executive, it is now up to the American  people and Congress to express our outrage and to work for a better South  Africa. Our goal should be the rapid dismantling of apartheid and nothing less.  De Klerk should be judged not by what he says, but by what he actually does.  </P></p>

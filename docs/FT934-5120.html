			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: How the chancellor views economic prospects The government's forecast of faster UK growth next year builds on a better than expected economic performance over the past six months. Although there is a widespread belief that Britain is still in recession, and some sectors such as construction are still very depressed, the country has been in recovery since the second quarter of last year. Seasonally-adjusted unemployment has fallen by 137,000 from its January peak of 2.99m. Gross domestic product in the third quarter was 1.9 per cent higher than the year before. Inflation, with the retail prices index up 1.8 per cent in the year to October and RPI excluding mortgage interest payments 2.8 per cent higher, is around its lowest levels for 25 years. Official figures have shown a slow down in the growth of industrial production since the spring while consumer demand has remained strong. Strengthening the UK's productive capacity remains a long-term challenge for Britain's policy makers.</p>

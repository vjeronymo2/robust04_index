			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Jurgis Jurgelis, general director of the </F> Lithuanian Department of Security, by Gintaras Visockas; place  and date not given: "Jurgis Jurgelis: `It's Not With a Great  Deal of Enthusiasm That I Talk to Journalists...'"]    [Excerpts] We talked with Jurgis Jurgelis, general director  of the Lithuanian Department of Security, at his office. Instead  of lasting the 15 or 20 minutes which the director had agreed to  grant ATGIMIMAS prior to our meeting, our conversation went on  for almost an hour. He was interrupted several times by  telephone calls: journalists from other publications wanting to  meet with him... [passage omitted]    [Visockas] Do you stay in touch with colleagues in Estonia  and Latvia? Are your relations with Riga and Tallinn close,  moderately close, or still rather distant?    [Jurgelis] I have to confess that our ties are very meager.  Our presidents spend time together, our prime ministers rub  shoulders, our foreign ministries associate with each other, but  as for us, well, unfortunately... Why? Stability is needed, but  for the time being, there is no stability in the Lithuanian  Department of Security. The most important reason for this is  the turnover of chiefs of the security service. What kind of  long-term cooperation can be established if our service is still  only starting to establish itself? So this is one of the main  reasons why there hasn't been a closer association with the  colleagues from Riga and Tallinn, despite the fact that there  are certainly common interests, such as the hostile activity of  foreign countries, narcotics, weapons smuggling...    [Visockas] Do you keep in touch with the Russian security  service? Are the ties friendly? Are they necessary?    [Jurgelis] Yes, they are necessary, if for no other reason  than that Lithuania wants to get documents back--the files of  people who previously worked in the Soviet KGB. A state  commission, to which I also belong, has been formed, and a month  ago, we sent a request to the Russian Ministry of Foreign  Affairs to hand over those files to the Republic of Lithuania.  We have not, however, received a reply thus far. Our cooperation  with Russian security ought to begin when we get these files  back. Getting these files back, as far as I know, is a concern  of not only the Lithuanian security service.    [Visockas] What should be the level of association with the  security services of the Russian Federation?    [Jurgelis] We need to make up our own minds on this. Let's  say that Poland signed an agreement with Russia on cooperation  in the areas of narcotics and weapons smuggling. This kind of  cooperation has nothing in common with politics.    [Visockas] How do you assess the performance of the  institution which you head?    [Jurgelis] I could only assign a very low grade. Our  institution is still in the process of getting established.  Indeed, none of the people whom M. Laurinkus brought along with  him are still here. We are all newcomers. It is bad that our  functions are not yet fully regulated by laws: Seimas has been  deliberating a draft law on the security service for half a year  now; last time barely ten minutes were allotted for deliberation  of the draft; I had time to say only a few words and the members  of Seimas managed to get in only a few responses...    What we are especially lacking in our service are trained  personnel, i.e. workers with a higher education who are  sufficiently young and are able to think analytically. The  prestige of the Lithuanian security service has fallen. There is  no heavy influx of people; we don't have a large pool to select  from. Low salaries, no doubt, are at fault for this.    Very soon, security service workers will have to recertify,  and we will have to let some less promising workers go. This may  lead to something of a scandal in the public.    On the other hand, though, this service holds promise for  young, talented, patriotically disposed people. Salaries, too,  will rise, and there will also be opportunities for training  assignments abroad. Those who regard us as the incarnation of  evil do so without foundation.    [Visockas] The publishing house MINTIS has published a book,  "The Secret Services of Lithuania: 1918-1940". Have you read it?    [Jurgelis] This is the first book about Lithuania's secret  services, so it should be popular. I had the opportunity to rub  shoulders with A. Anusauskas, its author. But so far, I haven't  had time to read the book carefully.    [Visockas] You can't fit it in?    [Jurgelis] That's correct, I can't. Those who know how to  work have free time, but I could not yet count myself in their  company. I am not yet able to organize my work in such a way  that a few free hours remain each day.    [Visockas] Did your relations to your family, friends, and  acquaintances change when you became head of the security  service?    [Jurgelis] I associate with my family and my close friends  in  the same way that I did before. It seems, however, that  relations with acquaintances have changed somewhat. Now, people  sometimes look at me with suspicion, with a certain degree of  distrust.</p>

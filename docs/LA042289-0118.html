			<p><P> April 22, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> 'PHARMACY' PAINTS VAGUE PICTURE OF FOREST DESTRUCTION  </P> <P> Medicine men using native plants to cure illness and prevent miscarriages or  conception? Mere superstition, right?  </P> <P> Not really, as more and more scientists, doctors and pharmaceutical companies  are realizing.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, as shown in "Jungle Pharmacy" (tonight at 6:50 p.m. and again  Sunday at 8 p.m. on the TBS cable channel), the South American rain forest that  holds the most promising plants may be chopped and burned down before most of  its trees, bushes, vines and flowers can be examined. (So far, only 1% of  potential medicinal plants have been studied, the program states.)  </P> <P> Along with the forests go the beliefs, culture and secret knowledge of the  tribes that live within them. Or lived. "Civilization" and its own diseases  have wiped out many.  </P> <P> Television is doing its part in telling the sad stories of deforestation and  culture destruction, as well as the encouraging one of ethnobotany -- the  increasingly important science recently covered by "National Geographic  Explorer" and a PBS documentary. It's too bad, however, that the important  information in "Jungle Pharmacy" is delivered in a rather vague, sleepy manner.  The program is worth watching, but you may need a couple of cups of that old,  unendangered South American brew -- coffee -- to stay with it. TERRY ATKINSON  </P></p>

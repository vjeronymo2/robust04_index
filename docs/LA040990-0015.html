			<p><P> April 9, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HORSEWOMAN CONNIE RING, 91, DIES  </P> <P> Connie Ring, who bred and raced top horses in California for more than 40  years, died Friday at Good Samaritan Hospital, where she was a patient for two  months.  </P> <P> Ring, 91, bought her first horse in 1947, paying $3,500 for a sore-legged  animal who never won a race and earned only $130. But that was the start of a  long love affair with racing that peaked in 1977, when Crystal Water, a horse  she bred, became the first horse to sweep the Santa Anita Handicap, the  Californian and the Hollywood Gold Cup.  </P> <P> Crystal Water, who ran with suspect ankles, later won the Oak Tree Invitational  at Santa Anita, beating Ancient Title and Vigors, and he was retired with  earnings of $845,072 -- one of the highest totals ever registered by a  California-bred.  </P> <P> Crystal Water's forte was grass.  </P> <P> "If he ran in a different era, he would have earned $2 million as a grass  horse," Ring once said. "He would have taken horses like John Henry and made  them look sick. I had a lot of respect for John Henry, but Crystal Water was  just fabulous on grass."  </P> <P> Another of Ring's standouts was Olympiad King, whom she bought for $16,500. In  1963, Olympiad King won four stakes, including a division of the Del Mar Derby,  and earned more than $100,000. He went on to a successful career as a stallion,  standing at Ring's 200-acre Three Rings Farm in Riverside County.  </P> <P> Windy Sands, who was Crystal Water's sire, was California's leading stallion in  1976, 1977, 1981, 1982 and 1983. Ring bred 36 stakes winners.  </P> <P> Ring employed only six trainers, including Jack Phillips, who trained Olympiad  King, and Roger Clapp, who was Crystal Water's conditioner. For many years, she  had a custom of buying her trainers a drink before her horse ran, and to also  join the trainer for a drink afterward.  </P> <P> Connie Ring was born in Memphis, Tenn., and after she moved to California with  her mother she became a secretary for George Ring, whom she later married.  Ring, who died in 1957, owned the Ring Oil Co. After his death, estate costs  forced Ring to choose between the oil company and the racing stable, and she  kept the horses.  </P> <P> George Ring didn't approve when his wife bought her first horse, especially  when he saw the condition of the animal. When Ring told her husband that their  stable name would be Three Rings -- one ring for each of them and a ring  representing the horse -- George Ring said: "Just make it two rings. I don't  want to have anything to do with the business."  </P> <P> But the same year she bought that first horse, George Ring bought her two more  horses for her birthday, including a yearling filly that cost $46,000.  </P> <P> "I have no children or relatives," Ring said in an interview in 1982. "But I  have my horses and all my friends that I've made as the result of those  horses."  </P> <P> Ring sold her horses and her farm at the end of 1988. In her will, she  requested that there be no funeral service. She asked that her body be cremated  and the ashes be scattered over the mountains.  </P></p>

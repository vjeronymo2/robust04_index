			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / EU seeks views on Cadbury link with lottery The European Commission is calling for comments on commercial agreements that link Cadbury Schweppes products to the operation of the National Lottery. The confectionery company is a member of the Camelot consortium that is due to launch the UK's National Lottery in November. Under the terms of the agreement with Camelot Cadbury Schweppes has the right to try to advertise its products in connection with the prize-draws - a connection that could be extended to television for an agreed fee. The plan is that confectionery displays carrying the Cadbury name will be offered as part of the lottery terminal which will dispense and authenticate tickets. The commission said yesterday that it was examining the consortium venture to see whether it contravened EU rules on free and fair competition - normal practice for any joint ventures that threaten, however remotely, to create a dominant position in the market. The commission said: 'This is purely normal.' It added that a decision would be taken in the next two months, well before the lottery's November start date. Camelot emphasised yesterday that retailers would be free to reject the Cadbury's display and have a terminal on its own. Retailers could accept the display and fill it with products of other companies. In calling for comments on any aspect of Camelot's plans the commission notes that Camelot is obliged 'to use reasonable endeavours to promote the use by retailers of a display unit supplied by Cadbury Schweppes to hold the lottery terminal and to display Cadbury Schweppes branded confectionery'. However, the commission added that retailers selling lottery tickets would be under no contractual obligation to go along with the Cadbury Schweppes plan. Cadbury Schweppes said yesterday it was fully aware that the European Commission was looking at the lottery agreement and did not believe this would present a problem.</p>

			<p><P> July 25, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE AWARDS $2 MILLION TO WOMAN BURNED IN '80  </P> <P> A 20-year-old Point Mugu woman has won $2.17 million in damages from the  federal government, 10 years after an off-duty sailor accidentally doused her  with burning gasoline while working on a car.  </P> <P> Christa Washington was 10 years old at the time of the accident that left her  scarred for life, said Assistant U.S. Atty. Roger West, who defended the  government in a lawsuit filed by Washington's family.  </P> <P> On July 13, U.S. District Court Judge Ronald S.W. Lew awarded Washington  damages from the U.S. government, which included $2 million for pain and  suffering, $47,070 for past medical expenses, $25,000 for home nursing care,  $95,000 for future medical expenses and $10,000 for impairment of future  earning capacity.  </P> <P> Washington said Tuesday that no amount of money can make up for the 10 years of  reconstructive surgery, skin grafts and "pure hell" she has been through to  repair the injuries she suffered.  </P> <P> She said she has no memory of the accident or of her first two weeks in the  emergency ward. "The first thing I remember was after the accident, being in  the hospital, fighting for my life," she said.  </P> <P> On Sept. 19, 1980, Washington was playing with friends across the street from  her family's home in military housing at the Pacific Missile Test Center. Two  Navy enlisted men were trying to start a 1964 Rambler in a garage, in front of  which the children were playing.  </P> <P> Larry Bartole was pouring gasoline from a coffee can into the car's open  carburetor to prime it while Neil Cleaves turned the key to crank the balky  engine, said Washington's attorney, John Zanghi.  </P> <P> The carburetor backfired, igniting the gasoline and startling Bartole, who  spilled some of it on his arm and ran out of the garage, Zanghi said. Bartole  later testified that he tripped over a stool or a bucket, spraying the flaming  gasoline onto Washington.  </P> <P> Bartole and Cleaves immediately smothered the fire with a blanket, but  Washington had already suffered burns on her head, neck, shoulder, arm and leg.  Bartole suffered burns to his arms.  </P> <P> Washington said that since the accident, she has undergone more than 20  sessions of reconstructive surgery and skin grafts under general anesthesia,  and countless more under local anesthesia. Her destroyed right ear was rebuilt  from tissue grafts taken from the unburned part of her body, she said.  </P> <P> Zanghi said she may also have to have an artificial joint implanted in her  burned thumb, which may suffer from arthritis in the future.  </P> <P> "She would have been a beautiful woman, there's no doubt about it, but she's  still badly scarred," Zanghi said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Washington said doctors allowed her to go home after about two months because  her mother was once a nurse in a hospital burn unit in South Carolina and could  change her dressings and handle much of her care at home.  </P> <P> Washington said school officials wanted to keep her back in the fifth grade.  "But I refused to be held back. With tutors and a lot of hard work I was able  to keep up," she said.  </P> <P> Washington's mother, Barbara Washington, sued Cleaves, Bartole and the federal  government, but Zanghi said he later dropped the men from the suit because they  had little money that could be taken for damages.  </P> <P> The case finally went to a non-jury trial in U.S. District Court in Los  Angeles, where Judge Lew ruled in the government's favor and against Washington  in September, 1988.  </P> <P> But Zanghi appealed the case to the 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, which  late last year reversed the lower court decision to Washington's favor and  returned the case to Lew to determine damages.  </P> <P> Washington, who still lives with her parents, said she sees Bartole often in  her neighborhood. "Being a Christian, I have to learn to forgive or forget, but  there's a certain something in me that can't forgive or forget . . . . I can  say, 'Hi,' but every time I see him, I think, 'This is the person that  disfigured me for life.' "  </P></p>

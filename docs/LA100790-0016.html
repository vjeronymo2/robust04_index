			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MIXED MEDIA: *** "ONE FAIR SUMMER EVENING" NANCI GRIFFITH ; MCA MUSIC VIDEO  LASER DISC ($24.95);  </P> <P> ITEMS IN THIS PERIODIC SURVEY OF POP-RELATED BOOKS, VIDEOCASSETTES AND LASER  DISCS ARE RATED ON A SCALE OF ONE STAR (POOR) TO FIVE (A CLASSIC).  </P> <P> What more can you ask of a video than it turn someone who was only mildly  interested in a veteran performer into a fan? Part of the credit on "Evening"  goes to director Bud Schaetzle, who has done an excellent job of capturing the  intimacy of a Griffith club performance in this modest but winning 45-minute  package. But the video's most important element is Griffith herself. A  singer-songwriter whose artful, warm music blends elements of country and folk,  Griffith sometimes seems a bit too understated on record, but she blossoms here  with a series of songs that are equally rich in detail and spirit.

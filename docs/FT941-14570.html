			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Driven to 'think global and act local' / A look at Mercedes-Benz's commercial vehicle strategy Mercedes-Benz was investing in the North American Free Trade Area before the company knew whether talks between the US, Canada and Mexico would succeed, according to Mr Bernd Gottschalk, head of the company's commercial vehicles division. Whether it was accident or design which led to the late-1980s purchase of Freightliner trucks in the US and the opening of Mexican capacity now making 12,000 buses and trucks a year, he does not say. But Nafta has encouraged a strategy towards positioning the company to take advantage of what he calls 'market conglomerates' or regional market groupings which have yet to come into being. He is already preparing for Mercosur, the proposed common market comprising Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay and he has posted watch on the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation group. If the world is to evolve into clusters of trading neighbours, Mercedes-Benz intends to be prepared. The company started preparing early for the arrival of Mercosur, laying plans to restructure its Latin American manufacturing and at the same time breaking into the regional market for vans. The task began last year with exports of vans from Spain to Argentina and Brazil. Meanwhile, capacity is being prepared in Argentina for the construction, starting in 1996, of a new van, the T1N, which is due to start production shortly in Dusseldorf. Of the 15,000 start-up production, Mr Gottschalk expects most will be shipped into Brazil. 'Our Argentine factories will in future concentrate on vans and gearboxes while buses and trucks will come from Brazil.' Driven to globalisation by high export costs and widely different market needs, Mercedes commercial vehicles is already one of the most international of the Daimler-Benz group's manufacturing businesses. As Mr Gottschalk says, DM10bn of his DM25bn (Pounds 9.7bn) annual turnover stems from production sites outside Europe. While the Mercosur arrangements represent a refinement of an established global investment policy, there is more foreign spending to come. In Europe, where Mercedes claims 30 per cent of the market for trucks over 6 tonnes and up to 12 per cent of van sales, Mr Gottschalk points out that future growth is strictly governed by expected economic expansion of 2 or 3 per cent a year. In China, he notes, Mercedes has 0.1 per cent of a market likely to expand by 8 to 10 per cent a year. In south-east Asia and other developing regions, market shares fluctuate between 0.5 and 1 per cent. 'We need new ways to enter these markets,' he says. Opening capacity, based on the 'think global, act local' tenet, developed by his predecessor Mr Helmut Werner, is part of the answer. 'We have to enlarge the philosophy.' This process, entailing knitting together the group's products and production sites into a global logistical network, has already started. Buses currently produced with a Beijing partner are built on a chassis from Mercedes do Brasil. New capacity planned for Shanghai will build a bus based on a current Turkish model. But the concept will be fully tested this summer at the company's Indonesian subsidiary, PT. GMM, selected to pilot production of a new light 'component' truck, the MB 700. Co-ordinated through a new regional logistics centre in Singapore; engines will be shipped in from Brazil, axles and drive trains will come from India. Japan will supply power steering and body parts will arrive from Spain. The truck will also provide supplies for Thailand and Taiwan. Mr Gottschalk also foresees the model coming closer to home. Turkey, he says, is an ideal production platform for central Asia. But he is reluctant to discuss prospects for building 'component' trucks within Germany, an idea which would spell the end of many more domestic jobs. He admits that with around 50 per cent of all parts made within domestic factories 'we do a lot more than we should.' His short-term target is to reduce vertical integration to 45 per cent. 'To go further than that we would need to change our whole production structure,' he adds. 'We are trying to be more international than any of our competitors. This is a new concept for the company. It requires new motivation, and we are in the process of convincing our German workforce,' he says. 'I never believed in the world car, and the world truck is a myth.'</p>

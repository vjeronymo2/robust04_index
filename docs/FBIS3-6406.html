"We felt both helpless and irked until very recently at  war-oriented reports from the United States," Kim said,  referring to snowballing coverage in the American media  depicting the Korean peninsula as highly volatile and threatened  by military confrontation arising from the inter-Korean nuclear  standoff.    "Why do the American hard-liners have to dump ashes in  solving the nuclear problem in the middle of negotiations, and  why do they treat so carelessly a problem that is a matter of  life and death to the 70 million people of our nation," he said  before giving a lecture at Korea University.    Tuesday's appearance was the first of a year-long lecture  schedule for Kim, who voluntarily ended his long career as an  opposition pillar after losing his bid for the presidency a  third time in 1992.    He now serves as head of the Kim Tae-chung Peace Foundation  for the Asia-Pacific region.    Kim wondered why the United States kept leaking such reports  without consulting with the South Korean Government and warned  Seoul to stay on guard against American hard-liners.    He ventured that North Korea and the United States have made  significant progress in improving relations and economic  cooperation in talks held under the table.    He said he felt Seoul was being left out as Pyongyang and  Washington invisibly stole the leading roles in the nuclear  negotiations.    "We have to look far into the future and prepare because  once  the nuclear problem is solved and North Korea-U.S. relations  improve, there will be a dramatic change to the relationship  where North Korea was regarded as a 100-percent enemy and the  United States as a 100-percent ally," said Kim.</p>

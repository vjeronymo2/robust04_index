			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CAMPBELL LEADS LEGISLATIVE JUNKET IN N.Y.C.;  </P> <P> LEGISLATURE: THE STATE SENATOR IS VISITING FINANCIAL AND CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS  IN THE BIG APPLE SHORTLY BEFORE HE LEAVES OFFICE.  </P> <P> Barely a month before he is expected to leave office for a high-paying private  job, state Sen. William Campbell (R-Hacienda Heights) is leading a weeklong  legislative junket to New York City that includes as part of the agenda a tour  of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.  </P> <P> As chairman of the Joint Legislative Budget Committee, Campbell is heading a  delegation of six legislators -- five senators and Assembly Speaker Willie  Brown -- who were sent to New York this week at taxpayer's expense to ask  investment bankers what California political leaders need to do to hold onto  the AAA rating for state government bonds.  </P> <P> But an itinerary of the New York trip, released at the request of The Times,  also shows that as part of their official duties, Campbell and his committee  staff met with Metropolitan Museum President William Lueres to tour the  world-renowned institution Wednesday.  </P> <P> Thomas A. Burns, staff director of the joint budget committee, said Wednesday  evening that he arranged the museum tour at the specific request of Campbell,  who has a "personal interest" in the cultural institution because he is a board  member of the California Museum of Science &amp; Industry in Los Angeles'  Exposition Park.  </P> <P> "It was his desire to have a better sense of how museums work," Burns said. "If  we can have quality museums in California, it will help provide better quality  of life for everybody in California."  </P> <P> In addition, Burns said that Campbell and his wife, Margene, have taken time  off this week to see the the Rockettes at Radio City Music Hall and "The Heidi  Chronicles," a Broadway production that received the 1989 Tony Award and  Pulitzer Prize for the year's best play. Tickets to the events were not put on  the taxpayers' tab, Burns added.  </P> <P> Informed of Campbell's trip, a spokesman for California Common Cause accused  the Orange County senator Wednesday of taking advantage of his elected position  just before he steps down next month to take a new job as president of the  California Manufacturers Assn., a powerful Sacramento trade group.  </P> <P> "I think it's safe to say that there's at least an appearance that there is a  free ride, a final journey of sorts, for a senator who may feel that this is  what the state owes him for his service," said Mark Haarer, acting director of  the public interest group.  </P> <P> "I don't think we owe Senator Campbell anything at this point," said Haarer.  "What he owes taxpayers is an immediate resignation from his position and a  refusal to embark on any future trips that may be of such lavish cost to all  taxpayers."  </P> <P> When Campbell announced his resignation Oct. 26, Common Cause criticized the  senator for not stepping down immediately instead of early January as he plans.  Campbell told reporters that he wanted to stay on to "clear up" a number of  legislative endeavors.  </P> <P> One of those is the New York trip, which Burns explained Wednesday is an annual  trek taken by a number of state legislators to huddle with members of the New  York financial community that assign ratings and help sell state government  bonds. Campbell's joint legislative committee began making arrangements for the  trip three years ago, and preparations for this week's excursion to New York  City were made in August, Burns said.  </P> <P> Accompanying Campbell this week are Sen. Robert G. Beverly (R-Manhattan Beach);  Sen. Alfred E. Alquist (D-San Jose); Sen. Nicholas C. Petris (D-Oakland); Sen.  Ken Maddy (R-Fresno); and Assembly Speaker Brown. Several of the senators  brought their wives along.  </P> <P> The group began arriving in New York Saturday and Sunday, and each senator is  booked in suites that cost at least $350 a night in the exclusive Park Lane  Hotel, a hotel clerk confirmed Wednesday.  </P> <P> During the week, the group has been scheduled to meet with representatives of  the Fitch Investors Service bond-rating firm and four bond houses, including  Drexel Burnham Lambert. In addition, Campbell's group has scheduled meetings  with officials from the Pfizer Corp., Philip Morris and U.S. Tobacco to discuss  the firms' concerns about the state's increased tobacco tax.  </P> <P> Such meetings, said Maddy, are crucial for keeping up good relations and  communication with bond house officials, whose highest AAA rating on state  government bonds helps save taxpayers millions of dollars in annual interest  payments.  </P> <P> In return, the Legislature's fiscal leaders also learn plenty from the New York  financial community, he said. "We learn a tremendous amount, we learn how we  should and can react in order to keep California strong and viable," Maddy  said.  </P> <P> Asked if the same would apply to Campbell, who has already announced he is  leaving public office, Maddy said: "I don't begrudge him the fact that he's  back here or that he's going to be a great benefit to California in his new  role."  </P> <P> Burns also said the public would benefit indirectly by financing Campbell's  visit this week.  </P> <P> "I think Sen. Campbell is going to provide service to the Legislature as an  adviser and a longtime friend to the members," said Burns, who added that  expenses for Campbell's wife would not be paid by the state.  </P> <P> Despite the schedule of important meetings, Campbell's group also has plenty of  time to enjoy itself. With bond houses in the morning and corporate executives  at dinner, the itinerary called for the lawmakers to take every afternoon off.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, for example, the group met with Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.  representatives over breakfast and then went on to the museum for the tour.  </P> <P> "We went to about noon (and) everybody went their separate ways," said Maddy.  "My wife and I did some shopping."  </P> <P> The schedule for Campbell's group also calls for the legislators to stay an  extra night and return home Friday morning, although their last official  meeting with Drexel Burnham is scheduled at 11 a.m. today.  </P> <P> Aide Burns said he allowed for the extra night in New York City because he  didn't want the lawmakers getting snarled in Los Angeles air and automobile  traffic.  </P> <P> "If you leave here (Thursday night), you get into Los Angeles at 5 or 6 at  night and it's a bitch to try to get across Los Angeles," said Burns.  </P></p>

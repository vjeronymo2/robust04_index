			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (27): Changing views in Tokyo - Yen Japan owes its image as a hothouse of technology to manufactured items, with computer hardware and components forming the bedrock of its IT industry. It has yet to produce its own software giant, like Microsoft. Yoshikazu Nishura, known as Joe to his colleagues at Sharp electronics in London, spent eight years in the US. He doesn't share the West's perception of Japan as being light years ahead. 'I felt the US is very dynamic and fast. I have a lot of worries about the future of Japanese industry,' he says. Nishura cites the openness of US society and the degree of co-operation between universities and industry as strengths that Japan currently lacks. He believes: 'In general white collar productivity is much higher in the US than in Japan.' So where does the success of companies like Sharp spring from? 'The Japanese are very good at certain specific tasks. Our hardware capability is very strong because we get information from studying manufactured items. And quality control is an area where we are very strong.' Quality was the key to Japan's eminence in computer chip manufacture - their engineers are famed for their refusal to tolerate bugs and minor errors. And Yasuo Fukami, a systems manager with Nomura Research Institute in London, agrees this is crucial. 'Whatever you build - computers, tools or radios - quality is important. And the Japanese are very strict on quality.' Owned by Nomura Bank, NRI is a systems house with 5,000 clients. Prominent among its successes is a 15 year contract with 7-11 Stores in Japan. NRI manages the systems needs of 7-11 in a very long-term relationship, providing the stability Japanese companies thrive under. Software development is not a stable science as projects are notoriously difficult to manage. Do the Japanese shy away from the prospect of open-ended research? Fukami thinks Japanese technologists like to know where a programme is taking them - 'writing software is not that different from producing high quality hardware. But we Japanese like to know what the final goal will be,' he says. The world of vogue high profile software products has had a hard time breaking through in Japan. This could be evidence of a healthy scepticism. Japanese IT directors are not easily swayed by the latest buzzword, says Fukami. 'We have no interest in fancy words. That means Japanese companies won't implement a new trend until they've seen it working successfully elsewhere.' Given the recent history of European companies embracing over-hyped concepts, this sounds like good practice. But it has drawbacks. 'People in the UK are keen to apply technology for trial use, they're interested in trying out new things,' says Fukami, who thinks his countrymen's natural caution has probably inhibited the adoption of advanced software. In the 1983 the Japanese Trade and Industry Ministry launched Sigma, a huge project to encourage common software development standards. Sigma ran for six years, but Japanese IT professionals are only just learning its lessons. Richard Hinder was Technology Counsellor at the British Embassy in Tokyo between 1988-93. He rates Sigma as a success. 'Japanese firms took a strategic view. The idea was to standardise software development and Sigma created that policy. It was a typical MITI collaborative project, that involved real action by industry.' Hinder witnessed Japanese companies attacking software development with a vengeance when he visited Kawazaki, south of Tokyo. 'Hitachi Information Systems are based there,' he says.' I saw 6,000 software engineers all using the same tool to tackle different projects.' To some western companies this is the stuff of nightmares - an army of programmers beavering around the clock to blow their product line out of the water. Should the West start to worry? Kyocera is a Japanese company that made its name in high-tech compononents and innovative printer technology. Kyocera UK general manager Phil Murphy has visited the parent company in Japan 10 times in the past three years. Murphy points out the Japanese have no problem writing games programs, but admits they still lag behind in the commercial arena.' The software issue sticks out like a sore thumb,' he says. The software side of Kyocera's work is carried on in California, lending weight to suggestions that the West still has the creative mindset necessary to make breakthroughs in complex coding. US software giant Oracle has generated vast profits by persuading businesses that they need its sophisticated systems. But until recently the Japanese marketplace kept the formidable Oracle sales machine at arms length. According to John McLevy, a senior consultancy manager at Oracle, a sea change is under way. He organised what he considered 'a pretty boring two-day event, a few speakers in a big hotel room' in Tokyo last September. He was staggered by the response - 'we had 750 people on the first day, around 1,000 the next. The Japanese have definitely woken up to the latest software issues.'</p>

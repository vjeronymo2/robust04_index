			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by President Rafael Caldera at Miraflores Palace in </F> Caracas -- live]    [Text] People of Venezuela: The government I head is  marking one month in office; a short month because February has  only 28 days. It included carnival, and although the government  worked every carnival day, more than half of the country was  absent from normal work during carnival.    As we mark our first month, I feel obliged to report to the  country the main aspects of the tasks we must carry out and the  measures we have adopted to face the situation. I will not tire  my compatriots -- the inhabitants of Venezuela -- by listing all  the bad things we have encountered. I can only say that the  situation was worse than we had imagined.    The country must realize that there have been many  difficulties but it must also be aware that from the very  beginning we assumed the firm determination of taking on these  responsibilities. Bringing order at home is a priority that is  very difficult to achieve when the home involved is large and  complex and when it is in disarray, as is currently the case in  Venezuela.    We are making great efforts to bring order at home. In all  sectors of public administration we have even had to resort to  partial restrictions of economic guarantees. The way this  measure was welcomed shows that the country understands the  situation we are facing. This measure was issued urgently to  stop confusion about the value-added tax, VAT; to stop applying  the VAT at the consumer level until we established new taxes as  part of a fairer fiscal reform that will place the heaviest  burden of public expenses on segments of the population that are  better suited to endure them.    I wish to reaffirm that the suspension of such guarantees  did  not seek to establish foreign exchange controls or decree a  maxi-devaluation or any other similar measures that I  categorically rejected during my inauguration as president of  the Republic. I wish to add that the powers that the Executive  Branch assumed after having restricted economic guarantees will  be exercised with moderation and responsibly only when they are  strictly necessary to seek economic stability, which is an  important goal that we must pursue.    Upon my reaching the government, the most urgent problem we  found was the fiscal deficit. Perhaps it is not the most  important one. The country has many more serious problems, but  this is indeed the most urgent. It calls for immediate actions  [obligaciones de immediatismo] that somewhat make us lose our  perspectives of primary medium- and long-term goals.    It is essential that we deal with the fiscal deficit not  only  to allow the state to continue to operate and exist, but also to  tackle the disease of inflation, which is a major disease that  is undermining all social segments, especially the poorest.  This situation could worsen if there is no solution to the  fiscal deficit problem.    We started by cutting spending. It is so difficult to deal  with a budget of 1.4 trillion bolivares and find out that many  expenses are fixed, that they cannot be changed -- for example,  our foreign debt commitments. Other expenses cannot be cut due  to humanitarian, social, or justice reasons. That is the case  of salaries because real salaries actually decrease, and in  general, they prove to be insufficient for most public sector  servants.    There are other expenditures that create social  conditions.... [pauses] making reductions almost impossible to  face. And then there are other expenditures in public sector  entities that are not under the control of the Executive Branch.  At any rate, the effort made this week has for the time being  entailed a reduction of 105.858 billion bolivares that in some  way contributes to lowering the deficit and, most of all,  provides a big example, because we are beginning by cutting the  presidency's spending to be able to have -- as we do -- the  moral authority to ask all sectors and all who receive benefits  from the Treasury to make their share of sacrifice. If all of  us are not ready to do what is indispensable, the situation  would be irreparable.    As for fiscal revenue, we now have the problem of  collection.  We have evidence that most taxes levied in Venezuela based on  current laws are not collected for reasons of incompetence,  corruption, or technical deficiencies, and many other kinds of  deficiencies regarding the tax collection system. That is why  we ordered the creation of an autonomous service for managing  and controlling taxes, as it exists in other countries that have  had the same experience and that provided us with instructions  and indications that have served us in good stead in facing this  issue. We firmly hope we will be able to increase revenues  substantially and this will be a major step toward lowering the  fiscal deficit.    However, we also have to increase revenues, mostly because  we  are determined -- and we have proved it and are reaffirming it  -- to eliminate the VAT at the retail level, as it is a very  heavy burden and a source of corruption that according to some  could become similar to the experience with Recadi [Differential  Exchange System]. We are, therefore, going to replace this tax  with fairer taxes that fall on those who can pay. The tax on  luxury items, for example, starts at 10 percent, we add another  10 percent, and another 10 percent later, based on the nature of  the luxury items that are purchased and that do not correspond  to the country's difficult situation.    This is a tax on wholesales, and it is selective. It serves  to place the State's need to obtain revenues to meet its needs  on fairer grounds. The amendment on the income tax, which will  go up to 34 percent, and which is an effort we are requiring --  and is required in other countries because developed countries  have a very high income tax. [sentence as heard] We are going  to do away with the excuse that tax payers often had to say: I  do not pay taxes because they are stolen. We now have the  guarantee that the tax money will not be stolen but will be  administered with utmost seriousness because the struggle  against corruption is a fundamental objective of this  government. We are not going to yield or fail in any way.    For that reason, the taxes that are collected will be taxes  for public spending and the service of the community. The tax  on banking debits, which will be a necessity this year because  the income tax will not be collected this year but the next, is  a temporary tax until 31 December 1994, as has happened in other  countries of the world. The finance minister will submit this  bill to the Chamber of Deputies, which he has asked to receive  him next week to submit the carefully drafted bills. With  regard to these bills, we hope the representatives of the blocs  that comprise the Legislative Branch will be receptive to them  as most of them have pledged to be.    This fiscal deficit problem, however, got more complicated  with the Banco Latino disaster, which represents the tailspin of  the moral crisis Venezuela has experienced in moral, economic,  and every other respect.    The Banco Latino case is very serious and the large number  of Venezuelans and foreigners victimized by that institution's  incorrect and criminal operations is really amazing and a source  of deep pain.    The government has not been indifferent to this at all. From  the very beginning, it has adopted every possible measure and  procedure. We even asked the Senate to ratify, in keeping with  the new Banking Law, the appointment of the new bank  superintendent and the new Deposit Guarantee Fund, Fogade,  president and we are confidently awaiting their ratification.    We appointed an Intervention Board, which all parties  involved in this problem have welcomed with great respect and  enthusiasm, I would say. I learned that the Intervention Board  has already made preliminary studies, and therefore, it is ready  to start revitalizing Banco Latino in approximately 30 days,  when it will be fully operational.    We chose to revitalize it rather than liquidate it because,  based on precedents in Venezuela and elsewhere, liquidation is  completely negative. Therefore, this is a clear path to  ensuring that those who have interests, deposits, and their  livelihoods in Banco Latino will find a way to transform their  rights [derechos] into stock or assets [pertenencias] in an  establishment that will be revitalized and reconfigured, and  well-managed. The pressure needed to get debtors to pay up is  already being applied.    By the way, there must be a collaboration by all the  branches  in public power, which we have had. Congress is issuing an  emergency law and the executive branch has voiced its views,  some of which have been accepted. We hope this step, taken by  Congress, will be fully satisfactory. At any rate, we are  willing to do whatever is necessary to ensure that it will be  truly efficient.    The Judicial Branch has also played a role. We are waiting  for the official who knows about the Banco Latino case and who,  according to the bill, would be the only person to intervene in  this matter -- we have many good references of her -- to  announce her decisions. The government will not point out the  culprits, however, the culprits that the Judicial Branch  designate, will be punished.    We will place all the state's power at the service of  justice  to ensure, if warranted, the establishment of penal punishments  and civilian punishments determined by the tribunals, as well as  precautionary measures that are indispensable to recovering, as  soon as possible, the money lost in the Banco Latino cataclysm.    We are, therefore, perfectly willing to offer our decided  support, without any distinctions, to provisions issued by the  Judicial Branch on this matter. I must say that the Central  Bank of Venezuela has helped us face the crisis. It has helped  by doing perhaps a little more than what is normally expected  from this institution.    I think, I am convinced that the country, all interested  parties, the depositors, checking account holders, and those who  had trust funds and interests at Banco Latino can rest assured  we are doing everything we can to overcome this terrible  situation in the most satisfactory manner possible.    Of course, the Banco Latino cataclysm, as I called it, has  influenced the financial system in general. The concern of the  government and all public sector organizations has been to  prevent similar situations from occurring at other banks to  which we gave, are giving, want to give, and will give all the  necessary protection to prevent the disaster that a financial  system catastrophe would entail for the country.    Fortunately, Venezuelans have been very prudent, and amid  the  uneasiness, anguish, and desperation that many feel, the actions  taken have built trust and created hope in the institutions and  systems that make up the Venezuelan economy.    This is all part of the economic policy. A medium- and  long-term economic policy has already started to materialize in  the tax reforms and, as we had said, its main concern will be  centered on the people and the struggle against poverty.  Although we have been unable to implement measures to produce  effective results immediately, the fact that we suspended a tax  that was going to have direct negative effects on the  grass-roots sectors and that we have presented Congress with a  proposal for a tax system -- the weight of which falls on the  privileged sectors -- clearly shows the path we aim to take.  Our concern is, of course, to fight the scourge of inflation  and, to this end, our efforts to remedy the fiscal deficit are  fundamental.    To the extent possible, we do not want to reduce social  expenses. The subsidies that are currently being paid will be  maintained; the government's main obligations in the struggle  against poverty will not only be maintained but we will attempt  to increase them. We will implement a persistent policy to  support grass-roots neighborhoods so that they can have running  water, housing, and necessary comforts of a modern life. Of  course, it is an ambitious, extensive program which will have to  start at the beginning but, I am sure, it will be received with  faith, confidence, and satisfaction by the Venezuelan  grass-roots sectors.    This economic policy becomes a commitment of solidarity. We  cannot carry it out if we do not obtain a fundamental agreement  among all the sectors. We have begun talks with businessmen,  farmers, small and medium-size industrial producers, and workers  to try to achieve a number of aspirations that have to be  obtained through consensus. The development minister has  announced the negotiation he carried out with commercial sectors  to avoid the unrestrained hikes of prices, which are already  pretty high. We have, however, had to decree a special measure,  postponing price control with regard to medicine, which is one  of the most delicate, serious, and acute aspects of the current  situation. Thus, we are optimistic in the sense that the  country's receptivity encourages us to believe that there is  confidence in the future. We still have to go through a very  difficult stage.    Currently, we cannot increase investments as we would like  to. We plan to encourage private investment by offering  stability and by effectively controlling inflation, which is one  of the most significant obstacles any investor can encounter.  In light of this, we are motivated by a commitment of  togetherness which fills us with faith and confidence.    We have encountered numerous problems and I would briefly  like to state that with respect to the military officers  indicted as a result of the events that took place on 4 February  and 27 November 1992, these individuals have received the  treatment that was announced from the beginning. The  disposition to dismiss the charges against all of them is still  in effect. Now, I would like to clearly state that I believe  that those officers who adopted an unquestionably political  position and are members of political groups should decide not  to rejoin the Armed Forces. The Constitution says that the  Armed Forces are apolitical as well as nondeliberating entities  and I am willing to respect and ensure this principle.    As commander in chief of the Armed Forces, I would not  commit the blunder of authorizing a political group that is  organized and active in the political arena to enter into the  Armed Forces. Instead, I open the way for it to participate in  civilian life and exercise all the rights that the rest of the  citizens have. I think the most honorable thing for an officer  who is passing from military to civilian life would be to do so  at his own request. I have not wanted to resort to other  mechanisms that would not provide them with an honorable  discharge as they have the right to demand and as befits them  because of their own conscience, rank, and military situation.  Therefore, I am willing to continue granting stays of  proceedings. Some, perhaps many officers may be able to return  to service because their particular case perfectly well  authorizes them to do so. But I really ask those who are  involved in political activity, and who are not hiding this but  are publicly showing this, to admit that the most honorable and  advisable thing for them and for everyone would be to have them  request, by their own decision, their return to civilian life.    To conclude, I want to state that the decentralization  process that began in the last few years will be continued by my  administration, but it will be decentralization not  disintegration. The national government is willing to maintain  the best relations with the state governors and municipal  mayors, but it is also ready to exercise and maintain the  prerogatives that the Constitution gives it. Those prerogatives  are in no way for the benefit of the national government but for  the fulfillment of the serious responsibility it has to the  country.    I tell my fellow countrymen that I reiterate my faith in my  country, that I reiterate my faith in my people, that I  reiterate my confidence in them, and that I am always ready to  clearly and frankly tell them the truth. We are not going to  conceal anything. We are going to listen to all complaints. We  have begun a process of dialogue. I received and spoke with the  Banco Latino demonstrators who came to the doors of Miraflores.  I have begun a dialogue with the university rectors to bring  about a solution of the pending problems. We have begun a  dialogue with the political parties represented in Congress and  I also hope it will be productive. This dialogue shows a  willingness to achieve what I mentioned earlier: the commitment  to solidarity. The problem belongs to everyone. Everyone has  an obligation. We all have to make an effort. We all have to  make a sacrifice and I am sure we are going to do so and we can  all, in solidarity, give a good account to the Venezuelan  people. Good evening.</p>

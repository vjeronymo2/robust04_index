			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Albert Maloveryan] </F>   [Text] Tallinn May 18 TASS -- The Estonian Government went  into an emergency meeting at 21:00 local time [1800 GMT] on  Wednesday to consider the possibility of resignation.    A proposal to dissolve the current government and to form a  new one was moved by the party Isamaa (Fatherland), the major  one in the government coalition.    According to Defence Minister Indrek Kannik, the main reason  for the cabinet's possible resignation is internal differences  between government members. Kannik himself was asked a few  hours before to step down as defence minister by Mart Laar,  Estonia's prime minister and Isamaa leader.</p>

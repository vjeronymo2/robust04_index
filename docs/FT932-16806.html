			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading THE SHARP decline on Wall Street, along with poor news on the UK corporate sector, put pressure on the Footsie futures contract, leaving it to surrender earlier gains, writes Joel Kibazo. Having opened at 2,887, good solid demand for the June contract on the FT-SE saw it advance steadily and by 12.30pm it was trading at 2,916. It maintained the early momentum over the lunchtime period, but the heavy falls in BAT and the poor form in New York proved too much to resist and the early buyers used the negative mood for profit-taking leading to a decline in the contract. It closed at 2,872, down 22 on its previous close and around 6 points below its fair value premium to cash of about 11. Turnover was around 9,000 lots. Volume in the traded options improved reaching 28,697 by the close. The FT-SE 100 option traded 6,533 and the Euro FT-SE option traded 4,534. Hanson was the busiest stock option at 2,418, followed by Pilkington at 1,223.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> On January 26, 1993 (58 FR 6098), the Commission published a proposed rule in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  to make mandatory licensee submittal in computer-readable format. A 90-day comment period expired on April 26, 1993. Comments were received from nine respondents. Two comments were not in favor of the amendments, whereas the others expressed approval and encouragement to take advantage of today's technology. Several constructive suggestions were made and are included in the summary of public comments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Summary of Public Comment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A summary of the public comments and a clarifying response follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Continued requirement for hard copy forms.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several respondents expressed the continued need for hard copy forms. One commenter stated their material control and accounting (MC&amp;A) program is based upon a ``paper trail'' utilizing the DOE/NRC Form 741. Another commenter stated the continued requirement for submitting hard copies to various Department of Energy contractors. Another commenter raised the question of storage of records for a period of time specified by Commission regulations. Concern also was expressed regarding secondary distribution requirements of hard copy DOE/NRC Form 741 for certain domestic transactions and all import and export transactions. Finally one commenter stated the current requirements, which provide for both computer-readable and hard copy, are the more acceptable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final amendments require licensees to submit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> computer-readable reports to the NRC in a format prescribed in NMMSS Report D&hyph;24. The amendments do not preclude other formats used for other purposes. Many licensees already generate facsimile reports for satisfying given requirements. Licensees that have no capability to produce these facsimiles may use the diskette provided by the NRC which can generate a facsimile (either hard copy or disk file for storage) of all forms subject to these amendments. With regard to records retention, the NRC permits the storage of records on electronic media with the capability for producing legible, accurate, and complete records during the required retention period. This would include computer generated facsimiles of forms subject to these amendments. For the reporting system to operate efficiently, computer-readable submittal for NRC's use is necessary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Accepting shipper's values.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A respondent suggested that the action code and date on the computer-readable DOE/NRC Form 741 for a shipment can be easily changed by the recipient to reflect accepting shipper's values. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The diskette that is available from the NRC includes a program for editing the file of a computer-readable DOE/NRC Form 741 to edit the action code and date to reflect accepting shipper's values. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Telecommunication of licensee submittal.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Four respondents urged the transmission of the computer-readable files over a modem instead of using diskettes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There is no disagreement with the commenters that modem transmission is desirable. Transmitting files by modem to satisfy reporting requirements is an option of these amendments. The NRC will work with any licensee desiring this option. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Revision of guidance documents.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several respondents noted the need to revise the guidance documents: NUREG/BR&hyph;0006, ``Instructions for Completing Nuclear Material Transaction Reports and Concise Note Forms''; NUREG/BR&hyph;0007, ``Instructions for Completing Material Balance Report and Physical Inventory Listing''; and NMMSS Report D&hyph;24, ``Personal Computer Data Input for NRC Licensees,'' to be compatible with the submittal of computer-readable formats. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NMMSS Report D&hyph;24 has been revised to include all the forms required in these amendments. The other guidance documents will be revised, as needed, to reflect the use of computer-readable forms to replace the paper forms. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental Impact: Categorical Exclusion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC has determined that this final rule is the type of action described in the categorical exclusion 10 CFR 51.22(c)(2). Therefore, neither an environmental impact statement nor an environmental assessment has been prepared for this rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Paperwork Reduction Act Statement <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This final rule amends information collection requirements that are subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). These requirements were approved by the Office of Management and Budget, approval numbers 3150&hyph;0003, &hyph;0057, &hyph;0004, and &hyph;0058. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because the rule will eliminate the need for certain paper forms, the public burden for this collection of information is expected to be reduced. The reduction in burden for the DOE/NRC Forms 741, 741A, 742, and 740M is estimated to average .25 hours per response. The reduction in burden for the DOE/NRC Form 742C is estimated to average 2 hours per response, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding the estimated burden reduction or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for further reducing reporting burden, to the Information and Records Management Branch (MNBB&hyph;7714), U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555&hyph;0001; and to the Desk Officer, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, NEOB&hyph;3019 (3150&hyph;0003, &hyph;0004, &hyph;0057, and &hyph;0058), Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Analysis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These final amendments have no significant impact on State and local governments and geographical regions. They have a significant positive impact on the efficiency and accuracy of the data collection process. The final amendments do not have a significant impact on health, safety, and the environment. This rule requires that all licensees submit computer-readable reports regarding special nuclear material transactions. The NRC will realize a significant cost savings. Licensees have already demonstrated their computer expertise by generating near-perfect copies of the current forms on Laser Jet printers. Generating computer-readable data in accordance with a prescribed format offers less burden than producing these near-perfect copies. The rule will facilitate the collection of data by the NRC to satisfy its statutory and treaty obligations. This constitutes the regulatory analysis for this final rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

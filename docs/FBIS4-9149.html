			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Alessandro Marzo Magno: "That Cursed Bridge"] </F>   [Text] It has been nicknamed "the Jansa road," from the  name of Ljubljana's former defense minister, a pacifist  converted to military uniform. It runs along a river that the  Slovenes call the Kolpa, and the Croats the Kupa -- the river  that marks the border between the two republics born from the  ashes of Yugoslavia.    The road is used to transport freight that is best kept  hidden from prying eyes. Mainly weapons. And even the maps have  been modified in order to facilitate this traffic. Thus a bridge  has "disappeared," though in fact it still exists, and it is  quite possible to cross it, even with heavy vehicles. The  bridge joins Slovenia to Croatia at a place called Bosljiva  Loka. It is a border crossing, but the fact is marked by only a  couple of road signs.    The one on the right bank reads, "Republic of Croatia,"  while  the Slovene notice reads, "Warning, state frontier." But in  between there is not the slightest trace of any border post.  There are no barriers, and it is possible to pass easily from  one country to the other without being stopped by police or  customs officers.    Along the road there are other bridges across the river. On  those there are fixed border posts for passport controls. Only  over the bridge that has "disappeared" is it possible to cross  the border freely. Last Sunday, as tourists crossed on their  way to the nearby Osilnica riding school, a Croatian police car  parked at the end of the bridge and the policemen in it glanced  wearily at their passports. On Sundays and holidays and at  night neither the Croats nor the Slovenes carry out checks.    This strange fact is explained by looking at the map. Across  the bridge, the road runs for some 10 km through Croatian  territory. It is almost all surfaced, apart from a stretch of a  few kilometers of dirt road, which is nevertheless perfectly  passable. After passing through some tiny peasant villages, the  road ends at Brodna Kupi. Here there is another bridge joining  Croatia and Slovenia -- this one equipped with police, customs  officers, barriers, flags, and everything necessary for a border  post.    Brodna Kupi is the first Croatian town on the road to  Delnice  and Ogulin, two towns on the Lika front, where Serbs and Croats  have waged a bitter struggle. A small turning leads to the road  to Bihac in Bosnia. In this area Slovenia and Bosnia are no  more than about 100 km apart. The road in question is the  shortest route for bringing weapons to the Bosnian Muslims.    The inhabitants of the villages around Bosljiva Loka say  that  there is a fairly steady flow of vehicles, considering the fact  that it is a country road. They include covered trucks with no  identifying markings.    On the Slovene side, near the bridge that "disappeared,"  there is the area of Kocevska Reka. It covers 76,000 hectares  and includes 1,400 km of roads. Under Yugoslavia it was  entirely off limits, a military zone. Under the mountains there  are outright citadels where the Belgrade government was supposed  to take refuge in the event of a war.    But Ljubljana always regarded Kocevska Reka as its own: Only  the commanding generals were Serbs; all the other officers and  men were Slovenes. The Yugoslav Federal Army, whose officers  were prevalently Serbs, was forced to accept this unpleasant  fact.  <H5>  Muslim Volunteers Come From Fiume [Rijeka] </H5>   After Ljubljana became independent from Belgrade in summer  1991 part of Kocevska Reka was turned into a nature reserve.  This pleased the inhabitants of the village that gave its name  to the area; since then they have no longer needed a special  permit to leave their homes. Another part remained a military  zone.    The main difference from Yugoslav times is that the Slovene  soldiers serving in the area have changed their uniform from  that of the Belgrade army to that of Ljubljana's armed forces.  And the inhabitants of the villages remaining within the  military zone still suffer restrictions on their freedom of  movement.    A kind of weapons bazaar has apparently been established in  the military bases of Kocevska Reka, from which the Bosnian  Croats and Muslims equip themselves. Moreover, the area --  strictly controlled and far from prying eyes -- is apparently  also used to train the volunteers on their way to the combat  zone. These are mainly people originating from the Middle  Eastern Islamic countries, who join the Bosnian Muslims in the  name of their common faith.    They reach the port of Fiume, where they mix with the  Bosnian  refugees. The capital of the Quarnero region is some 40 km away  from Delnice. A further 12 km away is Brodna Kupi, and the  start of the "Jansa road," which leads to Slovenia.    The weapons reach Kocevska Reka chiefly along two routes.  The first and shortest runs through the port of Capodistria  [Koper], where there are a number of warehouses -- which it is  inadvisable to approach -- under constant surveillance by armed  guards. The second route is from Hungary and brings  Soviet-manufactured weapons that used to equip all the armies of  the East, including the Yugoslav Federal Army.  <H5>  Germany and Austria Arm Slovenia </H5>   There is a third route, from Austria and Germany. The  Slovene  economy has been taken under the protective wing of the Deutsche  mark area, and it is no secret to anyone that Ljubljana's armed  forces are equipped with Austrian vehicles: It is enough to  look at the off-road vehicles and trucks that comprise the  military convoys. However, there is no proof that weapons from  Vienna or Bonn reach the bazaar at Kocevska Reka.    However, behind all this weapons trafficking, there is  apparently former Ljubljana Defense Minister Janez Jansa, who  was thrown out of the Slovene Government three weeks ago.    It is he above all who should be given credit for the rapid  Slovene victory over the federal-Serbian troops between the end  of June and the beginning of July 1991. Independence cost  Ljubljana some 10 days of war and seven lives. There were 46  casualties on the Serbian side -- a trifle, compared to what has  happened in Croatia and in the massacres in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Slovenia continued for a while to accumulate weapons, but  soon the war shifted far from its borders. Then Ljubljana was  able to begin a profitable trade. Its main clients are Croatia  and Bosnia. But there are people willing to swear that weapons  from Ljubljana have gone to Serbia too. Certainly, Serbian  goods, having passed via Hungary, do end up in Slovene stores,  and Slovene goods supplement Serbian contraband.    A few months ago a couple of Serbian traders introduced  themselves to the Slovene concessionaire of a very well known  American sports shoe manufacturer; they bought 3,000 pairs, paid  for them in cash, loaded them onto a truck, and left for Serbia.    Nepalese and Ukrainian soldiers monitor the UN blockade  along  the Hungarian-Serb borders. Many people maintain that these  soldiers, who suffer chronic poverty in their own countries, are  not unresponsive to the rustle of dollar bills. In other words,  just as shoes get by, so too could rifles.    The fact that not everything was clear in relations between  Jansa and Belgrade is confirmed also by the Belgrade daily  POLITIKA, which has been cited at length by Ljubljana radio.  The police of the Serbian-Montenegrin confederation arrested  Bazodar Spasic, apparently a senior agent of the UBDA, the  former Yugoslav secret service.    He was in possession not only of photographs showing a  number  of Slovene leaders in the company of prostitutes, but also of  documentary evidence of contacts between Ljubljana's defense  minister and the Serbian secret services. This information  comes from a Serbian source and is unconfirmed, but it is  somewhat significant if set within the broader context of secret  relations between the republics of the former Yugoslavia.    Sometimes the arms trafficking mechanism breaks down. This  happened, for instance, when 11 containers carrying 120 metric  tons of weapons destined for the Bosnian Muslims were seized at  Maribor airport. This caused a considerable political scandal  in Slovenia, involving Jansa and former Interior Minister Igor  Bavcar.    According to reports in the Slovene press, the VIS  (Ljubljana's secret service) strongly "advised against" checking  and monitoring consignments of "humanitarian aid" leaving  Maribor airport for Bosnia-Herzegovina.    There was an attempt to blame everything on the VIS chief in  Maribor, Silvo Komar, and on Bosnia's representative in  Slovenia, Hasan Cengic. Former VIS Director Miha Brejc said  that he knows absolutely nothing about any arms trafficking.  But then he added a remark that directly implicates Jansa and  Bavcar: "Is it conceivable that in such important and delicate  matters anything could happen without the agreement of the  political leadership?"  <H5>  "I Acted in the Interests of the Slovene State" </H5>   Komar was described by Jansa as the "owner of the 120 tons  of  weapons." But after a long silence, Komar replied in the weekly  MLADINA: "All my actions," he argued, "and those of our service  were carried out on the basis of a rigid hierarchical  responsibility and on the instructions of the head of the  service at the time. I was told that everything that went on  was in the interests of the Slovene state. Since the weapons  were discovered, I think that Jansa and Brejc know much more  about them than I do."    When questioned as a witness by the court in Maribor, Jansa,  not knowing what to say, accused the investigating magistrate of  misdirecting the inquiry and of being ill acquainted with the  Slovene laws governing arms exports.    Jansa also accused the magistrate of having indirectly  helped  the Bosnian Hasan Cengic, an arms dealer "against whom the  Slovene bodies concerned have issued an international arrest  warrant."    It may have been a coincidence, but two days before his  statement Jansa received a letter from the president of  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Alia Izetbegovic said that he was surprised  by the arrest warrant issued against Cengic and pointed out that  the Slovene Government leaders were fully aware that Cengic was  Bosnia's authorized representative and was acting on the  Sarajevo government's behalf within the context of Slovene laws.  So it was not private trafficking on Cengic's own account, as  Jansa maintained.    According to the official account, the seizure took place  because Ljubljana's Defense Ministry received an anonymous  message identifying the location of the secret consignment.  According to Croatian sources, however, the Slovenes thus got  themselves out of trouble after selling the same consignment of  weapons twice -- to the Bosnians and the Croats.</p>

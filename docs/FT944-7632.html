			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Optimism on Spanish economy Spain has upgraded its growth forecast for this year to about 2 per cent from 1.3 per cent, Mr Pedro Solbes, economy and finance minister, said yesterday. The recovery follows a decline of 1 per cent last year, the worst recession for three decades. Mr Solbes told an FT conference the government had to aim for rapid enough growth to bring down its 'excessively damaging' 24 per cent unemployment rate . The outlook was for growth of 3 per cent next year and 4 per cent from 1996. This could be made compatible with lower inflation and a 'reasonable equilibrium' in public sector finances and the balance of payments. Consumer price inflation was expected to come down to around 4.1-4.2 per cent at the end of the year, the lowest annual rate for at least 25 years, Mr Solbes said.</p>

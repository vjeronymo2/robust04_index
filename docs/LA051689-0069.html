			<p><P> May 16, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RAIL LINES FOR PUBLIC TRANSIT  </P> <P> We were quite excited to see the railroad's offer to sell 76.5 miles of unused  railroad lines in the Los Angeles area to start a commuter train (Metro, May  3). We urge everyone to lend support and contact local governments to make this  happen soon. The June deadline is an achievable target if people will work  together to solve our escalating transit problems. What a serendipity to our  communities!  </P> <P> We were both born and raised in Southern California; for the last three years  we have lived in Portland, Ore., due to a job transfer. We experienced the  initiation of the successful "MAX" mass transit system built on the old  railroad lines amid such criticism and nonsupport.  </P> <P> Once implemented, the people of Portland went crazy for MAX, its convenience,  speed, safety, and, oh by the way, additionally improved property values. Every  other major city has mass transit.  </P> <P> In our three-year hiatus, we cannot believe the increased traffic congestion  and severe impact on the freeway systems.  </P> <P> Rapid transit must be a No. 1 priority and heritage left to future generations.  The population explosion in our area and increased growth potential  necessitates immediate action. Citizens can be educated and retrained to  appreciate the ease and convenience of commuter rail transit. We all must reach  into our pockets and pay now for a better, safer and faster tomorrow.  </P> <P> MR. and MRS. TERRY R. NIELSEN  </P> <P> Upland  </P></p>

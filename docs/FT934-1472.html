			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / International Company News: BHP turns in 27% advance to ADollars 640m Sharply higher results from steel and lower interest charges offset a decline in earnings from minerals at Broken Hill Proprietary, and allowed Australia's largest industrial company to post a 27.5 per cent improvement to ADollars 640m (Dollars 432m) in profits after tax for the six months ending in November. But the group warned that it would be difficult to sustain this progress in the current six months. 'Profit outlook is sensitive to international commodity prices and these are currently at depressed levels (which). . . will make it difficult to maintain the improved profit performance in the second half of the year,' said the company. Moreover, at the operating level, BHP's profits increased by a far more modest 5.9 per cent to ADollars 2.01bn in the first six months. Revenues were up 4.2 per cent. Commenting on divisional results, BHP said the upturn in the steel division  -already marked in the first quarter of the year - was due to lower unit costs, in turn resulting from increased production and the benefit of cost reduction programmes. Australian domestic steel despatches totalled 2.003m tonnes, a 17 per cent advance over the previous year, and exports reached 1.267m tonnes, a 23 per cent increase. Net profits, before interest, for the division were ADollars 288.2m.</p>

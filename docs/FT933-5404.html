			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / Unsavoury recipe for recovery: Germans are being asked to work harder and expect fewer benefits Frills are out. White-collar staff at Daimler-Benz learnt this week that bonuses for having babies, bus and train fare subsidies and cheap personal loans have all been struck from the company's time-honoured list of employee benefits. In future they will also have to pay for the frocks and suits usually worn by their offspring at confirmation or first communion, and customarily paid for by the company. As all Germans will officially discover today, with the publication of a government discussion paper, Securing the Future of Germany's Economic Base, such challenges to the status quo may not in future be restricted to the occupants of Daimler's post-modern Stuttgart HQ. The paper, compiled by Mr Gunter Rexrodt, economics minister, says post-unification Germany, in its deepest post-war recession, will be able to afford fewer luxuries unless the country comes to terms with its economic and social failings; moreover, its people will have to work harder regardless. The core thesis is that Germany - its people, its politicians, its industry and its institutions - is growing older ungracefully. The Wirtschaftswunder, the society that created Germany's post-war economic miracle, suffers increasingly from short-sightedness, sclerosis and isolation from the realities of life in an increasingly borderless world economy. What is incontestable is that Germany's population is aging rapidly. At present there are almost three people of working age for every pensioner. In about 25 years the ratio will be two to one and then deteriorate rapidly, the paper says. Last year federal, state and local government benefits and subsidies accounted for the equivalent of 50.5 per cent of gross domestic product. This year, according to the BDI, the federation of German industry, the proportion will reach a record 52 per cent and, it adds, the country will be another step down the road towards becoming a state-controlled economy. The paper says those in employment do not work enough and expect too much from their employers and the state. Business and society are over-regulated. The state and its agents are over-involved in business: the death throes of industries such as coal are eased with subsidies, to the neglect of research and the country's economic future. As a cure, the Bonn government prescribes an extraordinary list of treatments: wholesale privatisation, deregulation, social benefits only for those in need, free enterprise kindergartens and a new education system. The labour market should be re-ordered to allow Sunday working, flexible hours and pay deals, and even, possibly, an end to the government monopoly on employment agencies. Shops should be allowed to open late. Restrictive practices in the guild-like trade organisations, which allow a qualified carpenter to build but not to plumb in a sink unit, must go, the paper says. It is radical stuff in conservative Germany. But in more typical style, Bonn first of all wants a debate, appreciating that it has little chance of implementing changes without a wide-ranging consensus. 'None of these themes lends itself to quick and conclusive treatment. But it is necessary to conduct the discussion,' Mr Rexrodt writes. The paper itself is alternately vague and admonitory and littered with obvious gaps where government colleagues have fudged or snipped out sensitive parts (a section proposing the dilution of pension rights, for example, was excised by labour minister Mr Norbert Blum). The end result is more an emotional call to arms than a policy statement. As Chancellor Helmut Kohl is likely to stress at the official launch today, the best way forward for Germany may be discovered by looking backwards. 'People in Germany were filled with courage and confidence during the post-war reconstruction. They were prepared to make efforts themselves and recognise the efforts of others,' the paper says. 'They accepted technical progress which made life and work easier . . . They understood initiative, the competitive spirit . . . public-mindedness, solidarity, tolerance and humanity . . . ' With one of several extracts from the dictionary of Thatcherite rhetoric, it adds: 'They did not only ask 'Who will help me?' but also 'Whom can I help?' They did not see only their rights but also their duties and responsibilities.' The discussion sought by Mr Rexrodt started even before his paper had been formally rubber-stamped by the cabinet. It was denounced from the left as 'a declaration of bankruptcy' for Bonn's economic policy. Industry, pleased to see many of its proposals included, murmured that it was a step in the right direction. In truth, steps in the direction indicated have been going on for months. Industry has had particular success in bending union leaders to accepting formerly unthinkable deals. Robert Bosch, for example, the electronics-based group, earlier this year won agreement for Sunday working in a new semiconductor factory. Its tactics could not have been more direct: either IG Metall, the union involved, accepted seven-day operations, or the factory would be built in Scotland. Adam Opel, the General Motors subsidiary, struck another ground-breaking bargain with the same union. The pay-off was work for almost 500 making diesel engines in Kaiserslautern rather than one of half a dozen options outside Germany. The price was round-the-clock working for five days a week, with Saturday maintenance work paid at normal rates, and an end to demarcation. This week's cut in Daimler's employee benefits was another link in a growing chain of settlements in which workers have shown themselves prepared to see benefits eroded in return for job security. As the 1994 pay round approaches there are already mounting signs that unions, after accepting an effective real pay cut for this year, will accept similar deals for next. In all these instances, the lever applied implicitly or actively against union resistance has been the threat of rising unemployment. The threat of job losses will be put to work again in the next few months as wage negotiations get under way. The government, too, has not been idle. By clamping down on prescription limits and raising patient contributions, it has engineered a sharp drop in the costs of the health service. At current rates, drug companies estimate spending on prescription drugs this year will fall by DM7bn (Pounds 2.8bn). Bonn has also announced its so-called budget consolidation programme to take effect from next January: a combination of cuts in social and unemployment benefits - previously considered untouchable - and higher taxes, intended to cut the ballooning federal deficit. But conditions are changing. The economy is by all accounts past the worst of the recession. As trade union confidence returns it may not be so easy in future for employers to tinker with time-honoured agreements, risking conflict and their company's precarious progress back to financial health. Obstacles to the government's grand project are already visible. For instance Bonn talks bravely of privatising all its business interests as part of its vision of a more deregulated economy. But most nationalised holdings - in banks, airports, car makers such as Volkswagen, water, electricity utilities and local transport - are in the hands of state or local governments, most of which have strong Social Democrat traditions. Which leaves Chancellor Kohl more or less where he was at the beginning of the year. It was then, as the recession was biting and the true costs of unification were striking home, that he launched his programme for a 'solidarity pact' between government, opposition, labour and capital, to collaborate to resolve the country's dilemmas. The pact eluded him despite his fine words and good intentions. There is little reason to suppose that words will be effective this time - even words which once worked so effectively for Mrs Thatcher.</p>

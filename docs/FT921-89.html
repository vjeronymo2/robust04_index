			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Large shift seen in Lancashire support A SURGE of optimism is spreading among Labour party workers in north east Lancashire as they claim to detect increasing evidence of their ability to capture several Conservative marginals. Hyndburn, based on the old Accrington seat, and Pendle, formerly Nelson and Colne, are vulnerable to swings of 2.3 per cent and 2.6 per cent respectively and seem almost certain to fall to Labour. The defending Conservatives, Mr John Lee in Pendle and Mr Ken Hargreaves in Hyndburn, are campaigning heavily on their local appeal and achievements while in office. Labour workers in both constituencies were yesterday expressing what appeared to be genuine surprise at some of the canvass returns. Mr Tim Ormrod, the experienced Labour agent in Nelson, yesterday used the emotive word 'landslide' to describe returns from what he said were wards with mixed voting records. An unscientific straw poll in Colne by the Nelson Leader newspaper four days ago showed similarly strong support for Labour. Mr Gordon Prentice, the Labour candidate, was more cautious but believed that he was on the road to victory. Mr Greg Pope, standing for Labour in Hyndburn, is forecasting victory by at least 3,000 votes based on canvassing returns which rated all undecided voters as non-Labour. There has also been a slight but distinct shift of attitude among Conservative party workers. Two weeks ago the mood was relatively positive. But expressions such as 'we have not given up hope' have now begun to slip into assessments of party prospects. The vulnerability of Hyndburn and Pendle increases doubts about the ability of Mr David Trippier, the environment minister, to retain Rossendale and Darwen, where a 4.2 swing to Labour is needed to unseat him. Labour is feeling sufficiently confident of holding on to nearby seats such as Blackburn and Burnley to begin switching workers to these marginal Conservative constituencies. The bookmakers have few doubts about voting trends. William Hill has Labour 4-9 on to win Pendle with the Conservatives at 15-8 against and Liberal Democrats at 8-1. Mr Pope is quoted at 2-7 on in Hyndburn. But few fortunes are likely to be made. The betting shop manager in Nelson said no one had yet placed a bet on the result.</p>

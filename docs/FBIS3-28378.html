Anyway, he said, Thai businessmen  do not need to worry about Vietnam's development because  Thailand is already on the road to development and is currently  strengthening its system.    Prayun, who made his comments on 4 February, said that the  lifting of the U.S. embargo would directly benefit Vietnam and  would boost the climate for trade and investment in Vietnam. As  for the United States, its businessmen will have direct access  to investment in Vietnam. They will no longer have to conduct  business half in the open and half in secret, as in the past.  Vietnam will also benefit from the move in that it will now be  able to seek foreign loans. Thailand, he said, can regard  Vietnam as a new market, because Vietnam is shifting toward a  market economy with the lifting of U.S. economic sanctions.  Meanwhile, Vietnam will become Thailand's competitor in the  future, especially in labor-intensive industries, because of the  fact that labor is cheaper in Vietnam than in Thailand.</p>

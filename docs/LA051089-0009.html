			<p><P> May 10, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Prince Charles will be seen on CBS' "West 57th" Saturday night in one of his  infrequent American television interviews. Selina Scott talked with the prince  April 20 at Sandringham, a Royal Family estate seldom visited by the press. On  the program (10 p.m., Channels 2 and 8), the prince says he has matured in his  role as the future king of England and has gained confidence in his own  judgment. "I was never certain that the feelings I had were worth expressing.  But now, I feel much more determined about them, and I think it's probably  something that happens to you when you reach 40."

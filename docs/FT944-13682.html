			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Survey of Aluminium (6): Lower production cuts the stockpile  -Richard Mooney discusses the importance to aluminium of the London Metal Exchange Aluminium has clearly been the London Metal Exchange's outstanding performer this year. At 49 per cent, its price rise since the end of 1993 beats copper into second place by 13 percentage points; and while it still has to play second fiddle to that contract in terms of turnover, it has narrowed the gap appreciably with a 48.5 per cent rise to 10.67m lots in the January-September period, compared with copper's 11.5 per cent rise to 12.2m lots. A less welcome distinction is aluminium's continuing unassailable lead in the LME warehouse stocks league. Although down by 460,000 tonnes from June's all-time high, the total, at 2.19m tonnes, is still nearly double that for zinc, which is itself well clear of lead and copper in the minor placings. That the size of the stockpile has been a millstone around the neck of the aluminium market as it has striven to lead the base-metals sector out of recession is beyond doubt. But it has become a less onerous burden of late, as concerted efforts by aluminium producers around the world to reduce excess production have led to a quickening drawdown from this overhanging reserve of metal. From the LME's point of view, moreover, the size of the stockpile pays a compliment to the success of the aluminium contract since its launch in 1978. 'The LME is now performing, with great ease and enthusiasm, the inventory financing job that was once done for consumers and producers by their own individual banks,' Mr Ted Arnold, Metals Analyst at Merrill Lynch, told a Metal Bulletin-sponsored conference in London this year. He said it was estimated that between 55 and 60 per cent of surplus aluminium stocks in the western world were now held on the LME, compared with only 14 per cent 12 years ago. Facilitating this development, Mr Arnold said, had been a change in the LME's membership structure. There were now far more banks and financial-services institutions, which had 'easy access to large amounts of money'. He quoted a survey produced by Alan Heap, of County NatWest Securities Australia, which showed that up to 80 per cent of all LME stocks were now held by financial institutions, rather than by 'traditional' users of the physical market, such as producers, merchants and consumers. But the development of a highly liquid LME aluminium contract has also altered the commercial behaviour of some producers of the metal, suggests Alcan Aluminum. In a recent issue of Compass, its house journal, the Canadian producer said that before they had the LME as a 'buyer of last resort' producers world-wide had been 'quicker to adjust their production to market needs. 'But today, things are quite different. New types of producers have entered the market over the past ten years - if they can't find clients for their metal, they simply sell it to the LME and receive cash.' Alcan also noted that it was mainly speculators who owned the aluminium in LME warehouses. 'These investors have nothing to do with the aluminium industry,' it pointed out. 'For them, buying and selling aluminium is strictly an investment decision.' Alcan is not alone in warning of the impact of the new breed of investors involved in LME trading. Buying by investment funds and banks had increased metal prices, and the volumes traded and sometimes caused prices to anticipate improvements in the fundamental supply-demand balances, County NatWest's Alan Heap told an LME seminar during London Metals Week earlier this month. But 'later in the cycle short selling by non-trade players may push prices lower than many market watchers would expect'. The threat was not immediate, however. Banks held metal in LME warehouses as collateral against loans, and also as a revenue-earning investment - so it was not available for immediate delivery. About half the LME stockpile was tied up as collateral, Mr Heap estimated. This 'financialisation' of LME stocks was part of the explanation as to how 'physical tightness' could drive aluminium prices higher at a time of 'statistical surplus', according to US industry analyst Stewart Spector. In addition, there were 'logistical problems' limiting how quickly metal not tied up in financing programmes could be shipped from the LME warehouses around the world, Mr Spector pointed out in the latest issue of his Monthly Aluminium Statistical Review. All this suggests that, while the market effect of the LME stockpile is not so heavy as it may at first appear, it is likely to last longer than producers would hope. At Rotterdam, where the amount of LME aluminium ingot awaiting shipment was estimated at 400,000 tonnes, and rising 'almost daily', port facilities were capable of loading no more than 60,000 tonnes a week and more probably somewhere between 30,000 and 40,000 tonnes, said the Spector review. 'At that rate, it could take well into 1995 to empty Rotterdam warehouses.' LME dominance of the world aluminium market could be facing a challenge soon, but not so soon as had been expected. The newly-merged New York Mercantile Exchange (Nymex) and New York Commodity Exchange (Comex) had planned to have a new aluminium contract up and running early in 1995, but Nymex chairman Daniel Rappaport admitted recently that that target was 'overly optimistic'. 'But there is still a chance for the end of 1995,' he added. One problem, he said, was designing a contract with specifications that met the market's needs. Another was properly integrating it with the LME's established contract. 'The Comex and LME contracts now feed on each other,' Mr Rappaport told the Reuters news agency, adding that Nymex's aim would be to create a similar 'symbiosis' with the aluminium contract. He noted that LME chairman Raj Bagri had told him that there was not room for two aluminium contracts. 'But he invited us to find that out for ourselves,' the Nymex chief added. One leading US producer, Kaiser Aluminum Corporation, seems to agree with Mr Bagri. 'Right now the LME has many delivery locations in the US, and it seems to be working efficiently,' said a company executive earlier this year. 'I don't see the need for another contract to get our business done.'</p>

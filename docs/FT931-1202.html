			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Survey of Bangladesh (6): Investors' two-way traffic - While some foreign companies move in, others call it a day THE general investment climate has improved over the past 18 months. Foreign companies are permitted to be 100 per cent owners of local subsidiaries, and import tariffs and corporation tax have been cut. However, the record is mixed. While some foreign companies have been expanding their operations in Bangladesh, others, especially drug companies, have been leaving. Among the exodus are Philips, the Anglo-Dutch consumer electronics group, and NCR, the US computer company. Drug companies, including Imperial Chemical Industries and Fisons of the UK and Pfizer and Squibb of the US, have pulled out partly because of a government policy banning the manufacture of some 1,700 generic drugs by multinationals leaving the market free for local companies. Squibb, having decided to sell out to local interests, finally shut its operations after 25 years in Bangladesh, apparently frustrated at the bureaucracy surrounding the sale. Pfizer, which has been trading in Bangladesh since 1955, employs 550 people with sales of Dollars 7m in 1990. 'The government does not seem to be concerned,' says Mr Syed Kabir, Pfizer's managing director. However, other companies are more encouraged. One move which has produced immediate benefits for foreign companies has been the relaxation on rules governing technical agreements. Previously foreign companies were not allowed to pay for technology transfer with foreign currency. This shift has produced tangible improvements at Bangladesh Tobacco company, part of UK tobacco group BAT. 'Product development is simply not possible here. That's why these relaxed conditions on technical exchanges are so vital. It has enabled us to benefit from the results of leaf research at head office in the UK, invite marketing expertise over and improve the factory,' says Mr Malcolm Fry, BTC's managing director. Lever Brothers, a Unilever subsidiary with a Pounds 25m turnover in toiletries, is also optimistic. It is looking to snap up the interests of one departing drugs company. 'We see no reason for panic because the government is introducing a degree of reality,' says Mr Ian Sangster, chairman. Nestle, the Swiss chocolate group, is also upgrading its operations, from agency to manufacturing in a joint collaboration with a local company. The biggest concentration of foreign companies is at the 400-acre Chittagong Export Processing Zone, where some 57 foreign and local companies with a collective investment of about Dollars 98m have been attracted by a 10-year tax holiday, purpose-built factories and non-union staff. A second 38-acre export zone in Dhaka is due to come on stream next month. A third is planned. Companies in the export zones escape the stifling red tape that remains the bane of industry and business.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Yurkin] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 17 Mar TASS -- The military-industrial  complex is experiencing difficulties caused not by budgetary  limitations but by military politics, Air Force Marshal Yevgeniy  Shaposhnikov, the Russian president's representative at the  Rosvooruzhenie joint stock society, said in an inteview with  ITAR-TASS here on Thursday.    He explained that munitions factories now remained without  stiff centralised administration and are subdivided into three  self-organised systems.    According to Shaposhnikov, one of them is engaged in filling  orders from the Defence Ministry and "keeps afloat with paltry  budgetary injections." The second, numerically bigger and more  important, is called upon "to develop new types of weaponry and  operate with an eye to the future."    It is financed with budgetary leftovers and is dragging out  beggarly existence, the marshal noted. The third, the smallest  in talent and technical potential, sells weaponry abroad. It  lives a lavish living. "Therefore, aspirants for foreign  business trips are besieging this system."    The marshal expressed opinion that the three systems should  be pooled into a powerful scientific and production complex to  work on three or four conversion programmes instead of the  present 11.    A specially appointed vice-premier should supervise the  complex. "The restoration of the vertical of production  subordination will immediately tell on labour productivity,"  Shaposhnikov claimed.    Consumer goods now account for 80 per cent of munitions  factories' output. But these goods overstock their warehouses  due to high prices and mutual non-payments. On the other hand,  Russia lost its place on the world arms market by cutting the  production of combat materiel.    The marshal suggests that Russia use the experience of  advanced arms-manufacturing countries. For instance, the United  States is not afraid of selling new types of weapons. It  channels earned revenues to research and introduces advanced  technologies.    Business-like Americans offer Russia surpluses of revenues  from their arms business for its conversion programmes, removing  thereby a potentially powerful competitor.    "The military-industrial complex does not need subsidies. It  can earn huge revenues for the Russian treasury. It is only  necessary to help it to brace for the implementation of a  long-term programme suggested by specialists," Shaposhnikov  concluded.</p>

			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Gains reversed by computer sell programs Wall Street A LATE wave of computer sell programs sent US stock markets into reverse yesterday, wiping out gains earned earlier on the back of a big fall in long-term interest rates, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 8.38 at 3,332.18, fallen more than 30 points in the last hour of trading. The more broadly-based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 also turned lower in late trading, losing 1.28 to 419.31, while the Amex composite closed 0.36 higher at 390.13 and the Nasdaq composite ended down 0.28 at 573.74. Turnover on the New York SE was 189m shares. The eagerly-awaited July employment figures, released before the market opened, showed a 198,000 rise in non-farm payrolls and a small decline in the national unemployment rate to 7.7 per cent. The payroll number, however, was distorted by a federal summer jobs programme for teenagers, which added 75,000 to the jobs list. The jobs situation was further confused by a revision in the June figures, which show a 63,000 fall in payrolls, and not the estimated 117,000 drop. The jobs data appeared to have little impact on the market, and share prices spent the first hour and a half of trading in a 5-point range. Computer buy programs and a big drop in bond yields then powered the market to a near 30-point gain, until late program selling sent prices into sharp retreat. Among individual stocks, disappointment at a profits warning from Hewlett-Packard was the feature of the day. The big computer group warned late on Thursday that its quarterly earnings would come in below analysts' expectations. By the time trading opened, the sellers had lined up and amid heavy trading Hewlett plunged Dollars 12 5/8 to Dollars 58 7/8 on turnover of 6.3m shares. Several other computer stocks fell in sympathy. IBM, which suffered from brokers' downgrades this week, fell another Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 87 1/8 on turnover of 2.2m shares, Digital Equipment eased Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 37 1/4 , and Motorola slipped Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 84 5/8 . The exception was Compaq, which firmed Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 29 1/8 . Among the leading stocks that fuelled the Dow's mid-morning rise and that held on to their gains were Exxon, up Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 63 1/2 , Disney, up Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 35 5/8 , and Procter &amp; Gamble, Dollars 1/4 higher at Dollars 49 7/8 . On the Nasdaq market, Ben &amp; Jerry's climbed Dollars 3 to Dollars 30 1/2 after the ice-cream company posted second quarter profits of 39 cents a share, up from 23 cents a share a year ago. Canada TORONTO share prices posted a slight gain in quiet trading, the composite index gaining 7.65 points to 3,406.30, as advances led declines by 291 to 192. Volume fell to 19.686m shares from 25.212m, and value was CDollars 242.6m against CDollars 285.8m. Sub-indices showed little movement, 10 finishing on the upside. Golds, banking and energy were somewhat higher and industrials, mining and consumer products were steady. Placer Dome reported higher earnings for the second quarter and six months, and the stock was up CDollars  1/4 to CDollars 13. George Weston, which reported lower second-quarter and six-month earnings, fell CDollars 1 to CDollars 35.</p>

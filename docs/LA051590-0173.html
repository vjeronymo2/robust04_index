			<p><P> May 15, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THEATER;  </P> <P> SHEM BITTERMAN SLOWS HIS PACE -- WELL, A LITTLE  </P> <P> Shem Bitterman claims to be slowing down. There was a time, he says, when it  took him no more than a day to write a play. Now it takes weeks, sometimes even  months, to finish a first draft.  </P> <P> Not that the 29-year-old playwright is complaining. By anyone's standard,  including his own, his recent pace has been torrid. "Three plays opening at the  same time doesn't usually happen," he acknowledged the other day over a lunch  of hamburger and ginger ale.  </P> <P> "The Ramp," Bitterman's obliquely drawn Holocaust drama about a romance between  a Nazi concentration-camp doctor and a young Polish woman, begins previews  tonight on the South Coast Repertory Second Stage. It premieres Saturday as  part of SCR's California Play Festival.  </P> <P> Last week, "Self Storage," a Hollywood satire co-written with Tony Spiridakis,  opened at the Odyssey Theatre in Los Angeles (to a negative review in The  Times). Next week "Beijing Legends," his epic-size drama about the Chinese  Cultural Revolution, is to open at the Pacific Jewish Theatre in Berkeley.  </P> <P> Speed aside, can a playwright address so many different subjects and say  something meaningful about each of them? Apparently a lot of theater experts  think so. This year alone, three of his plays won major awards.  </P> <P> "Beijing Legends" received a $17,000 grant from the Kennedy Center's Fund for  New American Plays. "The Ramp" earned second place and $2,500 in SCR's 1990  California Play Contest. And "Ten Below," a drama about homelessness, took top  honors in the National Playwrights Competition of the Unicorn Theatre in Kansas  City, Kan., where a production was mounted in January.  </P> <P> If Bitterman has any doubt about the seriousness or the sincerity of his art,  he doesn't show it. Pale, thin and blue-eyed, he looks like an intense  intellectual in his small round tortoise-shell glasses. And he sounds even more  so as he explains that it was a book -- Robert Jay Lifton's "The Nazi Doctors,"  which documented the participation of the German medical profession in Hitler's  plan to exterminate the Jews -- that initially compelled him to write "The  Ramp."  </P> <P> "As a Jew and as a writer, I had to examine how such a thing could happen,"  Bitterman said of the Holocaust. "It's a very tough, personal play. Ostensibly,  it's about a doctor who selects people to live or die on the ramp at Auschwitz,  but it's really about waking up to the evil in one's life. What the play tries  to capture, more than anything else, is the schizophrenia of denial."  </P> <P> Despite its subject, Bitterman notes, "The Ramp" makes no references to  crematories, ovens, gassings or other evils associated with Auschwitz. The word  Jewish is mentioned only twice and the camp itself only once in a line taken  from an actual letter written by a real Nazi doctor: "Auschwitz is a lovely  place to summer, but in the winter one should really stay at home."  </P> <P> The man and the woman in "The Ramp" suppress so much about themselves,  Bitterman asserts, that unless playgoers were to read the program (or articles  such as this one), they might not know until late in the play precisely what  the protagonist does in his work. "If you know, there's a terrific irony at  play," Bitterman said. "And if you don't, the whole thing plays out as a love  story and a mystery."  </P> <P> The oblique abstraction of "The Ramp" is intended not as an evasion of a  historic reality, he adds, but rather as its psychological reflection. The  Nazis, after all, preferred euphemisms and the nullifying language of  bureaucracy for their extermination program. People chosen for the gas chambers  were being given "special treatment." Those who did the choosing were  "processing pieces."  </P> <P> "Prisoners at Auschwitz, for example, were not allowed to say what happened  there," Bitterman explained. "To speak of it was punishable by death. Nobody  ever said, 'We are gassing people.' We know now that as the trains pulled up to  the camp, incoming German Jews would see Jewish women with long hair and  polka-dotted dresses sitting on green lawns, singing and telling jokes.  </P> <P> "It was all an instrument of denial and, for the Nazis, schizophrenic denial.  If you were a political prisoner, you wouldn't be selected for the gas chamber  even if you were Jewish because you were supposed to be serving a specific  term. If you contracted typhus in a camp, you wouldn't get 'special treatment'  until you were cured."  </P> <P> Bitterman contends, moreover, that the veil of hypocrisy enveloping the central  couple of "The Ramp" is not unlike the sort of contemporary moral blindness  that enables us to ignore the homeless or to live with environmental pollution.  "The truth makes us uneasy," he said. "Much better to exist in a dream of  denial."  </P> <P> Lacking any personal experience of the Holocaust, Bitterman visited Poland and  the Auschwitz camp, which has been preserved as a memorial to its victims and  as a warning to the world. Both the camp and the country imparted an  unutterable "sadness," he said.  </P> <P> Like "The Ramp," many of Bitterman's plays -- some 30 over the last 10 years by  his count -- have evoked what he calls "the drama of place." And they  frequently grow out of his travels.  </P> <P> Two trips to China -- in 1980 and 1985 -- led to "Beijing Legends." His years  in the graduate playwrighting program at the University of Iowa spurred him to  write "Iowa Boys," which was developed as part of the Mark Taper Forum New  Theater for Now program in 1986 and has become his most widely produced play.  </P> <P> Bitterman, who was born in New York, was brought to Los Angeles by the Taper  that year and recalls being "totally blown away" by the city. "It was my first  trip out here," he said, "and I thought it was one of the weirdest places  anywhere." Not surprisingly perhaps, he eventually wrote an evening of three  short plays about Los Angeles entitled "Tulsa," "Death in Venice, Ca." and  "Exile in Century City."  </P> <P> But if anything besides a sense of place unifies his work, it would seem to be  a certain grimness of material. In "Iowa Boys," a man beats his fiancee to  death and wakes up in the morning with no recollection of having done it. In  "Self Storage," a psychotic serial killer sells his life story to the movies.  In "Exile in Century City," the protagonist is strangled by a transsexual.  </P> <P> Bitterman also has written the screenplays for the mainstream gore flicks  "Halloween IV" (uncredited) and "Halloween V" (credited but rewritten by  someone else).  </P> <P> "It was a real job," said Bitterman, who moved to Los Angeles in 1988 and now  lives in the Los Feliz area. "I knocked off the first one in a week. They  called me the next year and asked me to write 'Halloween V.' I did that one in  three days. It was like writing a comic book. But it paid the bills."  </P> <P> In the meantime, his most recent screen-writing effort -- an adaptation of  another of his plays, "One Plus One Equals Three" -- has persuaded him that if  he wants to work in movies he will have to become a director.  </P> <P> "It's the only way to protect your material," he said. Bitterman said he tried  unsuccessfully to withdraw the rights to his screenplay after he and the  producer disagreed over revisions. "I rescinded. He sued. It would have cost me  a fortune to fight the suit. So I settled out of court."  </P> <P> That movie, entitled "Out of the Rain," has already been filmed with Michael  O'Keefe and Bridget Fonda in the starring roles but has not been released.  </P> <P>  "The Ramp" previews on the South Coast Repertory Second Stage today at 8:30  p.m., Thursday at 8:30 p.m. and Saturday at 3 p.m. The regular run opens  Saturday at 8:30 p.m. SCR is at 655 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. Tickets: $20  to $27. Information: (714) 957-4033.  </P> <P> </P></p>

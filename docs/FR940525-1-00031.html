			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It is hereby certified that the proposed changes to the Agencies' risk-based capital standards will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, in accord with the spirit and purposes of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). Most of the transactions that will be affected by the proposed changes are conducted by large banking organizations and large thrifts. In addition, consistent with current policy, the FRB's revised guidelines generally will not apply to bank holding companies with consolidated assets of less than $150 million. The intent of the proposal is to correct certain inconsistencies in the Agencies' risk-based capital standards and to allow banking organizations to maintain lower amounts of capital against low-level recourse obligations by adopting the current OTS capital treatment of those transactions. Accordingly, a Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis is not required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VIII. Executive Order 12866  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OCC and OTS have determined that the proposed rule described in this notice is not a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866. Accordingly, a regulatory impact analysis is not required. The intent of the proposal is to correct certain inconsistencies in the Agencies' risk-based capital standards and to allow banking organizations to maintain lower amounts of capital against low-level recourse obligations by adopting the current OTS capital treatment of those transactions. Under the proposal, each institution's measured risk-based capital ratio may change. However, this change in measured capital ratios should have no material effect on the safety and soundness of the banking and thrift industries. Most banks and thrifts have capital ratios much in excess of minimum requirements. Of the 11,071 commercial banks in operation at the end of September 1993, 10,824 were well-capitalized (risk-based capital ratios in excess of 10 percent). For the thrift industry, as of June 30, 1993, 1,561 of 1,752 savings associations were similarly well-capitalized. Given the high level of capitalization in the industry, the net effect on the safety and soundness of the banking industry and the overall economy should be minimal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IX.

Any revisions will be determined by the Federal Reserve Board under delegated authority from OMB.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Description of Affected Report  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Report Title: Consolidated Financial Statements for Bank Holding Companies With Total Consolidated Assets of $150 Million or More, or With More than One Subsidiary Bank.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This report is filed by all bank holding companies that have total consolidated assets of $150 million or more and by all multibank holding companies regardless of size.

			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Insurance covers BAT's downturn from tobacco - US price war hits underlying profits from tobacco Full year profits from BAT Industries, the tobacco and financial services group, were hit by an 18 per cent fall in underlying profits from tobacco - due largely to a price war in the US market. However, Mr Martin Broughton, BAT chief executive, said that the inroads made by cut-price brands in the US market had been partly reversed last year. Premium brands now had about 67 per cent of the market, an increase of some 5 percentage points from a year ago. Kool, BAT's main premium brand, suffered a fall in underlying volume of 18 per cent, in a market down by 5 per cent. All the loss of market share had come in the first half, BAT said, with the position stable in the second half. Trading profit in tobacco was down 8 per cent at Pounds 1.21bn, on sales up 9 per cent at Pounds 13bn. The profit figure was struck after a Pounds 138m profit from an exchange of brands last June with American Brands, and a Pounds 73m rationalisation charge, of which Pounds 51m was incurred in the US. Trading profits in insurance, excluding discontinued business, were Pounds 913m, an increase of 39 per cent in local currencies. Group profits on life insurance rose by 10 per cent to Pounds 321m. Eagle Star's general insurance business was hit by unexpectedly high provisions for discontinued financial insurance business. General insurance losses declined sharply to Pounds 9m, after Pounds 190m in 1992. Eagle Star's underwriting losses on continuing business fell to Pounds 142m (Pounds 280m), mainly as a result of rate rises and improved weather conditions. However, claims from domestic mortgage business rose to Pounds 115m. Losses from discontinued business were higher than expected at Pounds 143m (Pounds 145m). 'We got our model wrong and we had to beef up our assumptions,' said Mr David Allvey, group finance director. Eagle Star's premiums rose by 15.5 per cent to Pounds 2.21bn (Pounds 1.92bn), while life premium income declined to Pounds 861m (Pounds 866m). Its solvency margin rose to 56 per cent. For the group as a whole, profit in Europe was more than doubled at Pounds 765m. North American profits were down 15 per cent at Pounds 914m, while profits in the rest of the world were 7 per cent down at Pounds 462m. The tax charge was sharply lower at 30.3 per cent, compared to 41.5 per cent. This was mainly due to last year's enhanced scrip dividend, which saved the group Pounds 90m in advance corporation tax. A normal tax rate would be in the range 33 per cent to 35 per cent, BAT said. Balance sheet gearing dropped from 55 per cent to 40 per cent. Ten percentage points of the fall were also due to the scrip dividend, which saved Pounds 400m in cash. Earnings per share were up 31 per cent at 38.5p. However, the dividend was raised only 8 per cent to 20.1p (18.6p) via a final of 12.2p. Sir Patrick Sheehy, chairman, said this was partly because last year's low tax rate would not be repeated, and also because the group wanted to increase its dividend cover to at least two times. Last year's figure was 1.85 times.</p>

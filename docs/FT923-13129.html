			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / London talks 'last chance' THE leader of Bosnia's Serbs, Mr Radovan Karadzic, yesterday said EC-sponsored talks due to open in London today could be the last chance for peace and called on the United Nations to police a green line between the warring factions, Reuter reports. Mr Karadzic blamed Bosnian Moslem leaders for violating ceasefires in Sarajevo but said he was willing to meet them and Croatian leaders at the talks in London. He hoped the talks would achieve 'an unconditional ceasefire - then let us talk for 10 months if it is necessary, but without any more killing.' Mr Karadzic said he would welcome more UN monitors or peace-keeping forces to police all of Sarajevo, not just the airport where they are now, and to separate the warring forces. 'I would like the (UN) mandate . . . for the whole area of the city of Sarajevo and . . . I would suggest a green line between the sides in the conflict,' he said. He said he believed that all sides to the conflict might now understand that there could be no winners. 'I do hope that all three sides are aware that this may be the last chance for peace.' Mr Karadzic hoped the EC talks would lead to a formal resumption of the peace negotiations suspended in May by Bosnia's Moslem leaders in protest at a Serb mortar attack in Sarajevo which killed 16 people and injured 110. British officials said yesterday that Lord Carrington would have separate talks with Mr Karadzic, Bosnian foreign minister Haris Silajdzic, and Mr Marte Boban, a leader of Bosnia's Croat community. Peace talks that Lord Carrington held in Sarajevo earlier this month failed and were followed by one of the worst upsurges in fighting since the siege of the city began.</p>

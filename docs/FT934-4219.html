			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Finance and The Family: A Pounds 1.5bn sweetener - Value added tax / The Budget and You / The chancellor's compensation package Kenneth Clarke and Peter Lilley, the Secretary of State for Social Security, worked hard to try to calm the political storm over the imposition of value added tax on domestic fuel. While the chancellor did not reverse the change, as some people hoped, the compensation package was more generous than expected. More than Pounds 1.5bn of extra help will be provided over the next three years, in addition to the effect which VAT on fuel (at 8 per cent in 1994-95 and 17.5 per cent in 1995-96) will have on benefits linked to the cost of living. The package is designed to compensate all pensioners, widows and the long-term sick. Those on income support will see their benefits uprated by 3.9 per cent, rather than the 3.5 per cent that would otherwise have been the case. Nevertheless, charities felt the chancellor had not been generous enough. 'The measures announced will not fully compensate those with high fuel needs,' said Sally Greengross, director of Age Concern England. 'Fifty pence for single pensioners is only a half to two-thirds of what they need to compensate for VAT on fuel; 70p for couples is only around two-thirds of the amount needed. it is also important to remember that, although gas prices are coming down, the cost of electricity is rising.' Scottish charities also warned that VAT on fuel would have a particularly harsh effect on the elderly living north of the border where winter temperatures are much lower than in most of England. The following examples of how the benefits will work in practice have been provided by the Department of Social Security: A single pensioner not on income-related benefits. As from April 1994, the basic pension will rise from Pounds 56.10 to Pounds 57.60 a week. Of this Pounds 1.50 increase, 50p is extra money designed to help with VAT on fuel. In April 1995, there will be a further 50p a week help, and another 30p a week in April 1996. A pensioner couple not on income-related benefits. The married couple's pension will increase from Pounds 89.80 to Pounds 92.10 a week in April 1994. Of this Pounds 2.30 a week rise, 70p is a supplement intended to compensate for the fuel charge. In April 1995, couples will see a further 70p a week in VAT-related increases, and another 45p a week in April 1996. A pensioner couple aged between 60 and 74, and on income support. In April 1994, such couples' pensions will rise from Pounds 95.25 to Pounds 99.25 a week. Of this Pounds 4 increase, 70p is VAT-related. In April 1995 and April 1996, there will be further VAT-related rises of 70p and 60p a week respectively. A couple on income support with two children under 11. As from April 1994, the benefit for such couples will increase from Pounds 108.75 to Pounds 113.05 a week. Of the Pounds 4.30 a week improvement, 45p is VAT-related. Further VAT-based rises of 55p a week and 70p a week will occur in April 1995 and April 1996 respectively. Clarke also announced an increase in cold weather payments from Pounds 6 to Pounds 7 a week next winter, with a further 50p a week promised for the following winter. Funds for the home energy efficiency scheme, which provides grants towards domestic insulation, will also be increased.</p>

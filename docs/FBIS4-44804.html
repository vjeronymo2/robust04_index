			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article entitled: "Sligos at the Crossroads"] </F>   [Text] The software house Sligos is at a turning point  involving several challenges, including a new CEO, a weak  market, and uncertainty about its shareholders. Figures for the  1993 fiscal year have prompted Henri Pascaud, who just succeeded  Gerard Bauvin as the head of the company, to explain the year's  stagnating sales (the company posted turnover of 3.81 billion  French francs [Fr], up 0.4 percent over 1992 for the same sales  territory.) Pascaud attributes the plateau to flagging demand  from state-owned companies and a still weak market for Sligos's  facilities management services. The group's share of net  earnings totaled Fr160.6 million, down 7.1 percent from 1992.    Finally, although Credit Lyonnais, Sligos's primary  shareholder through its holding company Clio, is reorganizing  its industrial portfolio, current Clio president Gerard Bauvin  stressed that the bank had confirmed its continued strategic  interest in computer services. However, Bauvin also conceded  that Credit Lyonnais's financial imperatives suggested a  possible desire to share the financial burden of its computer  holdings with other partners.</p>

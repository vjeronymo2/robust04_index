			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Multiyear Sentences in Hashish Case"] </F>   [Text] Prison sentences of up to seven and a half years  were handed down in a big hashish case in Helsinki District  Court on Friday [18 February]. Police seized just over 50 kg of  hashish in Ristiina and Porvoo about a year ago in connection  with the same case.    The biggest quantity of smuggled drugs totaled 60 kg  hashish.  Six shipments of 3 kg had previously been smuggled into the  country.    The court found the two chief defendants guilty of seven  serious narcotics offenses. Three other defendants were also  given long prison sentences.    The stiffest sentence--unconditional imprisonment for seven  and a half years--was given to 51-year-old Onni Polvi. He had  been living in Belgium and had arranged drug purchases in the  Netherlands. He also transported some of the hashish to Finland  in his automobile. According to him, the largest drug shipment  had been transported in a Dutch long-distance truck.    The trial took a long time because of the Belgian  extradition  procedure. Polvi was arrested in Belgium back in April [1993],  but could not be brought to trial in Finland until January.    Polvi's companion, Rauno Latvala, 48, was given a seven-year  unconditional prison sentence. Just over 40 kg of hashish were  seized in his car repair shop in Ristiina in February 1993.  Latvala had also organized the distribution of the drug in  Finland. He was helped by his daughter and her husband.    The court sentenced 36-year-old Rudolf Rennock to six years  in prison and 29-year-old Nina Rennock to four years in prison.  Both of them had sold hashish, mainly in the area around the  capital.    The same case resulted in a five-and-a-half-year prison  sentence for Ari Muukkonen and a three-year prison sentence for  Tulan Suzan Josepoff. The court postponed its decision in the  case of the other five defendants.</p>

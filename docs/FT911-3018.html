			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (1): A spring in the market's step, Keynote - But the danger of volatility persists, as investors assess the reality of the recession and the chance of a political upset at a general election WITH THIS third issue of the Quarterly Review, we can celebrate a change to an altogether more favourable climate for long-term investors. October, focusing on the state of the markets as at the end of September, sentiment was at its gloomiest level for years. As for the January issue, with the long-threatened Gulf war in full swing the risks became accentuated. But so did the potential opportunities. Our conclusion then was that shrewd investors might need to be brave, but that the next few months would throw up considerable opportunities. So it has indeed proved. And whereas, in the depths of winter, it may have seemed hard to take the optimistic line, in spring the investor's fancy may be more easily tickled. But stock-market folklore brings due warnings ('sell in May . . .'), and enthusiasm needs to be kept well under control. There are no easy roads ahead. Rarely has the gulf of understanding between the securities markets and private investors been wider than during the past few months. And yet students of the markets will argue that there has been a classical pattern to the sequence of events. First, a few numbers. During the January-March quarter, the UK stock market rose by an impressive 16 per cent. This is on the basis of the broadest measure of the market's level, the FT- Actuaries All-Share Index which has some 670 constituents. The total gain by the All-Share since its low point at the end of September last year was 24 per cent. By any standards, the past six months has therefore been an excellent period for investing in Ordinary shares in Britain, and the same applies to most countries around the world. To get an idea of the global trend, we must look at the FT-Actuaries World Index, and this rose by 21 per cent in sterling terms during the January-March quarter, boosted by the 26 per cent jump by the US national index. The World Index has scored its impressive gain in the face of a considerable economic recession in several major countries, including the US and the UK. To some extent, the lifting of the war threat may be credited for the improvement in conditions. Last autumn there were fears of military catastrophe in the Gulf, and of crude-oil prices soaring to Dollars 70 a barrel or more. In the end, allied losses were light and the Saudi Arabian oil production and refining facilities escaped untouched. That was been transmitted to the financial markets. But broader economic developments also played an important role. It has become evident progressively during the last six months that the US has entered a significant recession and the UK a quite severe one. Those weak conditions have spread to much of Europe, certainly to France and Italy. But Germany has continued to boom, recording economic growth of above 4 per cent; and the Japanese economy has also continued to grow, although at a progressively more moderate rate. These divergences have fiercely pulled the markets in different directions. In particular, the first quarter of the year saw a dramatic realignment of the dollar and the Deutsche Mark, the latter dragging with it the whole of the European Monetary System, including of course sterling with effect from last October. On January 1, the dollar would buy DM1.495; on March 31, 14 per cent more at DM1.701. This had the effect of turning the US stock market into a surprising winner for many international investors, including those in Britain. Wall Street was strong, and the strength of the dollar ladled cream on the top. Thus, specialist American unit trusts, dogs for so much of the recent past, dominated the quarter's performance tables, with the best funds providing gains to UK investors of more than 40 per cent. Just why recession should spell so much profit is bound to be mystifying to many amateur investors. It should be emphasised, however, that there is nothing unusual about it. Classically, the biggest percentage gains in US stock-market indices are seen during the closing months of a period of economic recession. The market reacts to falling interest rates and anticipates the recovery in economic activity. stock-market rally, when the bond markets staged their own revival. According to the textbooks, equity markets follow a few months behind bond markets. The worry now must be that in Britain, for instance, the gilt-edged market ran out of steam back in the middle of February, and long-term interest rates have drifted up to the wrong side of 10 per cent. This is partly because the inflation news has tended to be disappointing, but more tangibly because Norman Lamont's Budget last month confirmed that the government will become a big borrower again, for the next two or three years at least. In February and March, as the UK stock market soared towards its all-time peaks in nominal terms, investors were making big bets on the ability of the economy to bounce back. So it will, but it may take longer than the dominant optimists have been assuming. Unfortunately the stock markets have become more than usually unstable places. They are dominated by professional investors who tend to think alike. Last year it was regarded as a clever idea to hold a lot of cash, which could earn 15 per cent, but when the stock market is rising rapidly the cost of such strategies can be very high. At the beginning of 1991, the big investment institutions are reckoned to have been holding around Pounds 35bn in liquid assets, and this was always going to pose the danger of a phase of panic buying. There is now a danger of further volatility, this time possibly in the other direction, as investors assess the realities of the industrial recession and the risks of political upsets as we head towards the next general election. But those investors who wisely bought around the lows of last autumn and again in early January need not worry that they will forfeit all of their gains.</p>

"TV 101," the series set in a  high-school video journalism class, is moving for the third time, heading for  Saturday nights at 9 as of Feb. 25. It'll take over the hour currently occupied  by the limited run of "The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour." A new series, "Hard  Time on Planet Earth," will premiere March 1 in the 8 p.m. Wednesday time  period where "TV 101" has been playing. "Hard Time" stars Martin Kove, late of  "Cagney &amp; Lacey," as an extraterrestrial convict sentenced to live on Earth  in human form. "TV 101," produced by Grant Tinker's GTG Entertainment, started  on Tuesdays and is the only survivor among GTG's three network series that  premiered this season. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

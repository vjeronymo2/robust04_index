			<p><P> February 4, 1989, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> KNICKS VALUE OAKLEY FOR THINGS FANS AND THE MEDIA DON'T SEE  </P> <P> What the Knickerbockers think about Charles Oakley first are things they think  only they appreciate. Things they think nobody else knows or cares about.  </P> <P> Like the episode at the video studio in Phoenix on the interminable last trip.  Or the incident the first time he played Philadelphia while wearing a New York  Knicks uniform.  </P> <P> They say, "He's a whole lot better than I thought he was," as Kenny Walker did.  That means on one level, he's a better basketball player. That's apparent. More  than that, they believe he's made them a better basketball team. "Stuff that  doesn't show in the stats," Walker said.  </P> <P> In the eighth game of the season, when Oakley was still making his transition  to the Knicks from his reputation with the Chicago Bulls, Walker's spindly body  was menaced by the burly Charles Barkley. "I remember it vividly," Walker said.  He and Oakley had Barkley trapped in the corner, Walker absorbed an elbow and  was charged with a foul as he lay on the floor. And Barkley flung the ball into  Walker's body and glowered over him. Few basketball players glower like Charles  Barkley.  </P> <P> "The first one there was Oakley," Walker said. "He was terrific. Some guys say  what they're going to do; he doesn't just talk."  </P> <P> He showed that quickly. "I'm a role player," Oakley said. "I had to prove to  them I can play. I think I've proved that."  </P> <P> One of his roles is that he is an enforcer. "A cop," Oakley called himself. The  good teams have somebody who stands over everybody's shoulder to make sure the  bully doesn't pick on the little guys. Oakley is 6-9 and he plays as wide as he  is tall. He will not be moved, which is also the nature of his game. He says he  fears no man without a gun.  </P> <P> He is a rebounder. "He is a house," said Mark Jackson. "He can't jump out of  the building, but he wants the ball."  </P> <P> His first news conference after being drafted by Chicago in 1985 was to declare  that some day he would lead the league in rebounding. And he did that the last  two seasons. "I like banging," Oakley said. "The things I do, I can't be  stopped. Rebounding."  </P> <P> Being the cop and the rebounder go together like iron and paint: When the ball  comes off the iron, Oakley is poised in the paint. Being an enforcer and a  rebounder are functions of desire and effort.  </P> <P> The strong chemistry of the Knicks has grown from that. It's not coincidence  that they are in first place. What they saw of Oakley was what an opposing team  sees in a handful of games. Sometimes they ask how come he does those things  against us. And sometimes what he can do goes unseen. "You don't appreciate  what he does until you see him night after night," Jackson said.  </P> <P> What he does, Walker said, "are things the fans don't see, things the media  doesn't see."  </P> <P> Like last weeks' visit to Phoenix. Oakley pulled Jackson, Walker and Pete Myers  out of the hotel to make a tape, lip-synching and gyrating to rap lyrics.  Oakley has done that before, sort of as traveling social director. "On the  road, the walls have a tendency to close in on you," Walker said. "It's good to  have somebody to get you out.  </P> <P> "It's easy to do if you're going well. I like guys who can come out when  they're going bad. He gives everybody a lift."  </P> <P> He is also playing very good ball, which is really where it all begins. When Al  Bianchi made the trade, he identified Oakley as a rebounder, which was what he  showed in Chicago. "I was trying to tell them I could do more," Oakley said. "I  said I should be more involved. In Chicago, they said I had a bad attitude. In  two years, no play was ever called for me. They said I was a rebounder and  shouldn't need a play called for me."  </P> <P> He is still a rebounder but Rick Pitino calls a postup for Oakley from time to  time. "He lets me know he cares," Oakley said. That's part of the art and craft  of coaching. Last season Oakley got nine shots a game and felt unappreciated;  this year he's averaging 10 shots a game and feels in the middle of everything.  </P> <P> He is a rebounder. But it's one thing to get the ball off the boards and  another to do something with it. "In Chicago, they said I didn't do anything  with it," he said. "I don't know who they were watching."  </P> <P> With the Knicks, he has established himself as a skillful passer, first on the  outlet to begin the break and then in the half-court offense. "He'll throw the  ball underhanded or throw a baseball pass," Walker said. "That stuff you don't  see in the stats."  </P> <P> The stats say he went into Thursday night's game with Cleveland averaging 10.9  rebounds and 12.8 points a game. They blew out the Cavaliers. Oakley had his  basic game with 16 points and 13 rebounds, eight off the defensive board where  the break begins. He has had double figures in both in 29 of the first 45  games, which is in line with his career figures, but in less playing time.  </P> <P> He also dresses better than his teammates knew, which is part of his  contribution to this team. He is what Jackson defined as "a juicer." Oakley is  the arbiter of style. Like if Sidney Green's garb doesn't meet the demands,  Oakley will tell him, "Nice suit."  </P> <P> "It means I got a messed-up suit," Green said.  </P> <P> Oakley, of course, denies that role. "Mark," he said. "He's a juicer's juicer."  </P> <P> But Oakley reaches out to needle all of them. "Patrick, myself or Greg Butler,"  Walker said, slicing across the strata of the team.  </P> <P> "The only way we can repay him is to work as hard as he does."  </P> <P> And to be there if he needs them. That time came at Atlanta when Oakley got in  a scuffle and Walker went to his aid. "I can't do as much for him as he can for  me, but I'll be there," Walker said. "I threw my little body out there."  </P> <P> That's appreciation.  </P></p>

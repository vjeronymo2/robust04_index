He warned that the  failure of this agreement would lead to a comprehensive chaos in  the region.    In an interview to the Qatari paper AL SHARQ, which it  published on Thursday [13 January], the brother President leader  Abu-'Ammar stressed that the Palestinians would not be the  losers at the end because instability would affect all the  region.    The brother President leader Abu-'Ammar added that while the  Palestinians demanded a full Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza  Strip and the Jericho region, the Israelis wanted to carry out  an operation of redeployment of their army which is a matter  violating the agreement signed between the two sides.    The brother President leader Abu-'Ammar added that Israel  wanted to control crossings in order to make the Palestinians  live in isolated areas, which is a matter rejected by the  Palestinian side in the negotiations.    The brother president leader criticized the Israeli Prime  Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and said that he was not interested in  anything anymore now that he has received the U.S. reward for  signing the Washington agreement including weapons, a giant  computer which can only be found in super-powers in addition to  240 million dollars to spend on redeployment of Israeli forces  in addition to other U.S. loan guarantees.</p>

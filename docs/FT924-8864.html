			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / Letter: Treasury not to be totally excluded Sir, In his article 'Not accountable yet' (November 2), Samuel Brittan says that in my article 'Disarming the Treasury' I proposed that the Treasury should cease to be a forecasting organisation. In that article (which I wrote while I was at the London Business School), I said that there should be a considerable widening of the sources of advice for the chancellor and a reduction in the weight placed on the Treasury's internally generated views. But I added: 'This would not exclude the Treasury from offering independent advice, based on its own analysis and forecasts.' Alan Budd, 30 Laurier Road, London NW5 1SG</p>

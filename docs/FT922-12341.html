			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / UK Company News: UK buyers blocked by block condition - Selling 60m Midland shares in one place lends uncertainty to HSBC's bid THE 60m share stake in Midland Bank which overhung the market for three days before being sold on Thursday, could not easily be placed with UK institutions because the owner, Kuwait Investment Office, wanted to sell it as a single block. Investors said the lag in placing the shares also reflected underlying uncertainty about the final outcome of the bid for Midland by HSBC Holdings, parent of Hongkong and Shanghai Bank. The stake - equivalent to roughly 8 per cent of Midland's total equity  - was first offered for sale on Tuesday, the day HSBC Holdings, the parent of Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, offered paper worth 378p for each Midland share. On Tuesday and Wednesday, traders said the KIO was trying to sell its block at 362p a share. At that time, the 3 per cent discount to the market price was simply too small to encourage buyers in for a stake of that size, investors said. Significantly, market sources said that Lloyds Bank, which is thought to have made a rival offer for Midland earlier this year, was not a purchaser of the KIO's shares. The difficulty the KIO had selling its stake only added to market anxiety. 'The KIO overestimated the ability and willingness of institutions to arbitrage the stock,' said a fund manager with a large UK institution. On Thursday, Hoare Govett, the stockbroker which has a long-standing relationship with the KIO, was said to have completed the sale of a block of 60m shares at 356p each. Most of the buyers were said to have been US and Asian-based arbitrageurs. Midland's shares closed down 2p at 362p on Thursday. That day HSBC's shares rose again, pushing the value of the all-paper offer to 396p. The gap between the two prices indicated that Midland's shareholders might decline HSBC's offer. UK investors said that their ability to purchase the KIO stake was hampered by technical factors. Although a valuable arbitrage could be achieved by buying the Midland shares and selling HSBC's shares short, such a transaction is difficult for non-UK shares. Also, settlement dates for UK and Hong Kong stock markets vary, a factor which would have forced the purchaser to hold the shares in both banks for several days. But aside from technical considerations, institutions have expressed little enthusiasm for the deal, and purchasing more Midland shares meant buying a bigger stake in a bank they are uncomfortable with. 'There is an option (in the HSBC bid) to take bonds or equity and it's likely we will take as much of the debt as we can,' said one large Midland shareholder, who said he had been unhappy about Midland's association with Hongkong and Shanghai Bank for years. A lacklustre presentation to shareholders last Wednesday by the two banks did little to woo the waverers. Though few analysts believe that Lloyds will mount a counter-bid for Midland against HSBC at this stage, they do not discount the possibility that Lloyds might enter the field if the HSBC bid fizzles out. The KIO still holds a 2 1/2 per cent stake in Midland.</p>

			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil hits post-Gulf war low OIL PRICES hit a new post-Gulf war low of Dollars 16.40 a barrel for Brent Blend yesterday. The price later recovered to Dollars 16.55 in late London trading, but analysts saw little scope for any early sustained rise. News agency reports said ministers from the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries had begun telephone contacts on ways of shoring up prices. A Reuters report said those included a possible appeal to non-Opec countries to reduce their output as well as the possibility of a cut in the Opec production ceiling of 24.52m barrels a day. Analysts noted, however, that any reduction in non-Opec production would have to include significant cuts in North Sea output, which is expected to surge by as much as 700,000 barrels a day by next month compared with September. 'There is no chance that the UK government would go along with any cuts,' said Dr Leonidas Drollas, chief economist at the London-based Centre for Global Energy Studies. 'And I doubt that Norway would do it again,' he added, in a reference to Oslo's decision in the 1980s to close some production facilities at a time of very low oil prices.</p>

			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Japanese parties seek allies as race for power begins Japan's political parties yesterday began the race to form a new government following Saturday's resignation of Mr Tsutomu Hata's eight-week-old minority coalition. Mr Hata stepped down rather than face a parliamentary no-confidence vote that would risk a general election after he failed to persuade the opposition Social Democratic party to rejoin the coalition. 'It is urgently important for politicians sharing similar policies and ideas to establish a stable government and I will resign in order to pave the way for reform,' said Mr Hata. Japan faces a pressing economic and foreign policy agenda, with the recent plunge in the dollar's value against the yen, the summit of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations on July 8-10, and the nuclear threat in North Korea. Mr Hata and his cabinet stay on as caretakers until a new administration is formed. He attempted to calm fears that his resignation would create a leadership vacuum by assuring US president Bill Clinton that Japan would push on with talks to resolve their trade dispute. The government would also continue its work on economic deregulation and tax reform, about which it is due to unveil a package of measures tomorrow. Leaders of the conservative Liberal Democratic party and the leftwing SDP, the two largest opposition groups, plus the New Harbinger party, a centre-left splinter group from the LDP, yesterday said they were considering an alliance. 'The opposition owes responsibility to end the political confusion,' said Mr Yohei Kono, president of the LDP, which was in power for nearly four decades until it lost a vote of no confidence last June, thanks to the defection of a faction led by Mr Hata. However, a coalition of the LDP and SDP, which for years opposed each other, is likely to be more fragile than the last government. The SDP was yesterday undecided on whether to seek to rejoin Mr Hata's camp, two months after storming out of the coalition, or throw in its lot with its former enemies, the LDP. Mr Tomiichi Murayama, SDP chairman, said he would try again to form a government with the outgoing coalition, but was prepared to ally with the LDP if this failed. Both Mr Murayama and Mr Kono were cited as possible candidates for the post of prime minister. Equally, there was some support for reinstating Mr Hata, amid speculation that he had staged a tactical resignation with that in mind. Mr Masayoshi Takemura, head of the New Harbinger party, said it 'would not be totally impossible' for Mr Hata to become prime minister again. By yesterday evening, Japan's political parties were no closer to clarifying the succession. 'We can't say what will happen tomorrow. In fact, we can't even say in the morning what will happen in the afternoon,' admitted Mr Kozo Watanabe, number three in Mr Hata's Japan Renewal party.

			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> IRS Cancels Sale of Paulsen's Winery: The Internal Revenue Service said it  canceled the public sale of comedian Pat Paulsen's troubled winery operation  and property in northern Sonoma County because of legal challenges made by  Paulsen's bankruptcy attorney, David Replogle. The forced sale of Paulsen's  home, winery and the village of Asti, which he owns, had been set for Sept. 13.  </P> <P> The IRS seized the property and put it up for sale to recover $277,000 in  unpaid taxes owed by Paulsen and his first wife, Jane Paulsen. Replogle said  the Paulsens' property is in Chapter 11 bankruptcy, which provides protection  from creditors while debtors get finances in order. The Paulsens' total debt is  $2 million. "The IRS is not above the law, they have to follow the same rules  as everyone else," Replogle said.  </P></p>

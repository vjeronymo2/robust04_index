			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] [Correspondent Hajrudin Sermic in Maglaj] Maglaj is  going through the worst day of shelling since the beginning of  the war.    The unprecedented horrors of Maglaj's inferno have descended  on the population with a vengeance this morning. The heaviest  shelling since the beginning of the war is going on as I am  filing this report. Dozens of howitzer and mortar shells fired  in salvos are crashing onto the town center every minute. The  town is being shelled from several directions and by all means  at the enemy's [Bosnian Serbs] disposal. Five Russian-made  surface-to-surface missiles have been fired at civilians and the  town itself this morning. Casualties have been reported,  although the exact numbers are impossible to determine.    The Serb aggressor's offensive against the defense positions  held by our [Muslim] defenders continues with the support of  several hundred missiles fired from artillery pieces of all  calibers. Concentrated fire is being directed at the area around  the Nekolje dam. However, the fighters of the 201st Valiant  Brigade and other units of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army cannot be  swayed and are not giving in an inch.</p>

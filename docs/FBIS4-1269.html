			<p>BFN     [Text] Yesterday afternoon, ECOMOG [Economic Community of  West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] soldiers  prevented a team of NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia]  Legislative Assembly members in Kakata from entering Monrovia.  Reports say ECOMOG is insisting that the officials had to be  cleared at headquarters for official pass, a move condemned by  the NPFL's TLA [Transitional Legislative Assembly] members. The  NPFL Assembly members condemned ECOMOG for [words indistinct] in  the way of free travel between Monrovia and Gbarnga, saying  there is no need for a pass system in a reunified Liberia.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Inaugural address by Prime Minister Jean Kambanda; place </F> and date not given -- recorded]    [Excerpt] I, Jean Kambanda, in the name of the Almighty,  swear before Rwandans that I will carry out my duties, that I  will not act against the Republic of Rwanda and the head of  state, and that I will work for all that is useful for Rwandans,  that I will abide by the Constitution and other laws.    Your Excellency, madame deputy speaker of the National  Council of Development; Your Excellency, the minister [as  heard]. Rwandans, our country is currently going through  difficult times. We are going to set up a government which will  deal with the very difficult question of war and also the  question of insecurity in the country and famine, especially  among those displaced by the war. The three points make up the  program of the present government. The present government will  therefore carry out its duties especially by providing security  for people and property and by restoring understanding among the  people. That is why the ministers in charge of security, that  is, the ministers of defense, communal development, and justice  will do everything possible to restore peace as soon as  possible. Let us say within about two weeks.    The minister of justice should do his utmost to convene a  meeting of all heads of tribunals so that they can start  investigations to identify all wrongdoers, such as those who  killed and looted in many areas of the country, especially in  Kigali town. The minister of defense must do everything  possible to restore peace and tranquillity in the entire  country, especially in Kigali town. The minister of interior  and communal development is asked to convene a meeting of all  prefects as soon as possible so that they may look for ways of  restoring peace and pacifying the Rwandans.    Second, the current government will continue talks with the  Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] so that transitional institutions  based on the Arusha agreement may be set up in six weeks' time.  The Rwandan Government believes that there is no other way of  restoring peace to the country apart from continuing talks with  the RPF.    That is why it stresses the fact that the RPF should know  that the problems with which our country finds itself following  the death of the president of the republic, His Excellency Major  General Juvenal Habyarimana, followed by that of the prime  minister and some government members and innocent people, should  not be a pretext for renewing the fighting since, as we said  earlier, the government is going to do its utmost to restore  peace in the country.    I thank the outgoing government for everything it did  towards  setting up transitional government institutions despite the many  hindrances to the implementation of the planned program. The  Rwandan Government will do its utmost to ensure that all the  hindrances to setting up the transitional government are removed  so that the Arusha agreement may be implemented as agreed. This  will be done with only the welfare of the people at heart and  not personal or group interests.    Concerning famine, which is the third objective of this  government, the Ministry of Planning and Communal Government is  called upon to start talks with the nongovernmental  organizations which have always assisted us in our problems so  that we may get enough assistance to go to the rescue of the  people affected by famine almost everywhere in the country,  especially those displaced by the current war which we have  known for almost four years.    Rwandans and friends of Rwanda, this country is in a very  critical situation. The contribution of everyone is necessary  so that we can solve the difficult problems. That is why we  call upon international organizations and traditional friendly  countries to support this government so that it can carry out  its three-point program. [passage omitted]</p>

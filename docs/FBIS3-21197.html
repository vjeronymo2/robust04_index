The council which is the highest determining body of  university management decided on observer participation of  foreign professors; this is a very unusual attempt in national  universities. Observers have no voting rights when determining  important policies, but their proposals are recognized. At the  council meeting held on 16 September, the designated Professor  of Education Pak Son-u from Korea was the first to participate.  Saying ``this is a `splendid deed' and also advances the  internationalization of public universities which is lagging  behind private universities,'' Professor Pak was frankly happy  with his participation.    This system is the proposal of the school president Reona  Esaki, aiming to actually ``to make a university with an  international viewpoint.'' This is an idea much in keeping with  Esaki who is well informed of world affairs, but other ideas  aimed at developing international exchange without stopping here  are concealed.    One of those is to extend the term of foreign professors  which is currently a five year term. In calling for prominent  scholars from foreign countries, the lifelong employment system  will become an international custom. In the future, this will be  deliberated in the council.    It has been one and a half years since Esaki, a Nobel Prize  recipient, ended over thirty years living in the United States  and took the position of president of Tsukuba University. The  policies for ``activation of the university'' set forth since he  took that position have taken the form of pledges.</p>

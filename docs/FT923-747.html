			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / US-Japan chip dispute defused A POLITICALLY sensitive trade dispute between Japan and the US was yesterday defused at least until after the US presidential election, following government reports that the foreign share of Japan's semiconductor market rose significantly in the second quarter of year. The US and Japanese governments said yesterday that the foreign share of Japan's market rose to 16 per cent, compared to 14.6 per cent in first quarter. This was the biggest quarterly increase since 1986, when the the US and Japan signed the first semiconductor trade agreement. 'The increase in market share is a positive step in the right direction and is an indication of an improved effort by Japan to comply with the semiconductor trade agreement in the second quarter,' said Mr Andrew Procassini, president of the Semiconductor Industry Association, a US trade group. Japanese government and industry officials also welcomed the increase, although they expressed concern that further progress would be difficult to achieve while the electronics industry continued to be in recession. The Electronics Industries Association of Japan, the private industry association, made a commitment in June to increase the purchase of foreign semiconductors in the second half of the year at a faster rate than the increase in Japanese semiconductors. The commitment, however, was predicated on a recovery in the economy during the second half of the year that now looks difficult to achieve. The Japanese government last year acknowledged US industry expectations that foreign market share should grow to more than 20 per cent by the end of this year. Many in the US industry have interpreted this as a commitment by the Japanese side The second quarter increase in market share could help to deflect US government anger. Last month a US government inter-agency review concluded that Japan's efforts to open its semiconductor market had produced 'insufficient progress'. Mrs Carla Hills, the US trade representative, warned that America would take 'additional actions, as necessary, to fulfil the terms of the (1991) arrangement,' if substantial progress was not achieved by year end. Yesterday Mrs Hills said the rise in market share 'represents the first bright spot we have seen in an otherwise disappointing first year of the 1991 arrangement.' Two Japanese camera manufacturers have reached an out-of-court settlement with Honeywell, the US electronics company, over their alleged infringement of its patents for auto-focus cameras, writes Charles Leadbeater in Tokyo. Olympus Optical has agreed to pay Dollars 34.7m (Pounds 20.2m) and Asahi Optical will pay Dollars 21m to settle a dispute over the patents. Both Japanese companies also disclosed that their financial results would deteriorate sharply this year as the slowdown in the Japanese economy takes its toll. Olympus said it expects to make an after-tax loss of Y700m for the first half of the year after initially forecasting a Y1.5bn profit. Asahi is also expected to make a loss after initially forecasting a small after-tax profit.</p>

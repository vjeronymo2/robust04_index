			<p><P> January 11, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENCY;  </P> <P> DOLLAR GAINS DESPITE FED INTERVENTION  </P> <P> The dollar finished higher Tuesday against most major currencies in global  foreign exchange trading despite what dealers described as light dollar-selling  by the Federal Reserve.  </P> <P> Gold prices were mixed, falling in New York after rising in Europe. Republic  National Bank in New York quoted a bid for gold as of 4 p.m. EST at $403.80 an  ounce, down 70 cents from Monday's late bid.  </P> <P> Currency dealers said the dollar began rising early in the European day, after  opening lower in the wake of central bank intervention on Monday.  </P> <P> Traders were hesitant to take the dollar above 1.8300 West German marks for  most of the day but gathered courage late in the European session after noting  that the West German Bundesbank had been absent from the open market.  </P> <P> The Fed appeared to have intervened after the dollar edged toward 1.8325 marks  late in the morning session in New York and reappeared to sell dollars again in  mid-afternoon when the currency drifted up to about 1.8375 marks, according to  Daniel Holland, vice president at Discount Corp. in New York.  </P> <P> "The move was not concerted because the other central banks had already gone  home for the day," Holland said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Comments Aid Dollar  </P> <P> But he said the market wanted to know whether the Fed wanted to curb a rise in  the dollar and found, "The Fed does mean to be here."  </P> <P> The dollar's rise also was encouraged by reports of comments by Beryl W.  Sprinkel, the White House chief economic adviser, who questioned the validity  of central bank intervention.  </P> <P> Holland said the dollar's rise came mainly on speculative activity by  professionals traders buying to cover earlier promises to sell the dollar  rather than "real corporate demand for the dollar."  </P> <P> "We have some people throwing in the towel here, saying it doesn't look like  it's coming down," he said.  </P> <P> In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins, the dollar  fell 0.39 Japanese yen to 125.70 yen. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at  126.30 yen. In New York, the dollar rose to 126.325 yen from 125.975 yen on  Monday.  </P> <P> In London, the dollar gained against the British pound, which fell to $1.7643  from $1.7650 late Monday. The dollar also rose against the pound in New York,  where sterling fell to $1.76475 from $1.77325 late Monday.  </P> <P> On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell $1.10 to  $403.80 an ounce.  </P> <P> Earlier in the day, gold rose in London to $404.75 from $402.75 late Monday;  climbed to $405.10 in Zurich, Switzerland, from $402.75, and edged up 5 cents  to $407.23 in Hong Kong.  </P> <P> Silver for current delivery slipped 4.7 cents an ounce to $5.916 on the Comex  in New York. Earlier in London, silver rose to $5.98 from $5.94.  </P></p>

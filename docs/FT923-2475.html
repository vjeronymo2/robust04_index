			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / The ERM and Britain: Labour pins blame on ministers LABOUR acted swiftly yesterday to pin the blame for the interest rate rises firmly on the government's refusal to stimulate the economy. Mr John Smith, who is at the Socialist International conference in Berlin, said: 'Mr Major and his government have failed not just their country but the whole (European) Community.' The Labour leader highlighted the opposition's consistent demands, dating from well before the April election, for tax incentives for industry and other measures to stimulate growth. He added that yesterday's events represented 'an almost total defeat' for the government's economic strategy. 'This is the result of the failure to invest, of the failure to pay attention to the real economy. It's the fundamental weakness of the economy after 13 years of Conservative government that is at the heart of the matter.' In London Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, pressed home Labour's attack, pointing out that Tory election propaganda had consistently promised sustained recovery and lower interest rates. Labour will make the prime minister, not Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, the principal target for attack when parliament is recalled next Thursday. Senior party sources said: 'We are not going to accept that Norman Lamont might be the ultimate fall guy. For it was the prime minister who could not have been more categoric about staking his reputation on the value of the pound.' The Labour leadership must nonetheless tread warily, knowing that a number of its senior spokesmen are critical of the opposition of Mr Smith and Mr Brown to a devaluation strategy. The party leadership will keep a tight rein on its internal dissidents ahead of Sunday's French referendum. It will then have three days to devise a coherent position on the ERM, sterling and the Maastricht treaty that will command the maximum support across the party.</p>

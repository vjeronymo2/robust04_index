			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / Water company price agreement NORTH WEST Water yesterday reached agreement with Ofwat, the water industry regulator, to hold back price increases for the years to March 1994 and March 1995. In September, Ofwat told 19 of the 33 water companies of England and Wales that it wanted the benefit of falls in construction costs to be passed on to customers. North West is the last of the 19 to reach agreement with Ofwat. North West's water prices will rise in 1993-94 by 4.7 per cent above the rate of inflation, compared with the annual rise of 5 per cent above the rate of inflation set for the company at privatisation. In 1994-95 its prices will rise by 4 per cent on top of inflation.</p>

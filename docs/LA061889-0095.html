Will putting reflective foil in the  attic help much and what is the best way to install it myself?  </P> <P> ANSWER: Putting reflective foil under your roof is one of the most effective  methods to reduce the heat buildup in your home and cut your air-conditioning  costs. With adequate attic ventilation, it can significantly lower the  temperature of your ceiling. You can often feel the difference in your rooms.  </P> <P> Although standard fibrous attic insulation, like fiberglass, blocks conductive  heat loss in the winter, it is not very effective at blocking the radiant heat  from a hot roof in the summer. The insulation itself gets warm and the heat  comes right through into your living area.  </P> <P> Heavyweight aluminum foil or reinforced foil are excellent materials to use.  The aluminum is reflective, so some of the roof's heat is reflected away from  your ceiling.  </P> <P> The primary heat reduction property of aluminum is that very little heat is  reradiated from the shiny underside to the insulation and ceiling below. With  adequate attic ventilation, much of the heat is carried away.  </P> <P> For greatest heat reduction in the summer, install the reflective foil on the  underside of the roof rafters. This leaves an air gap above and below it, which  is necessary for its reflective properties to be effective.  </P> <P> Although it sounds strange, if you install single-sided foil (kraft paper on  one side), face the shiny side down, away from the roof. This reduces the  radiant heat flow to ceiling.  </P> <P> Some recommend just laying the foil across the top of the insulation on the  attic floor. This may cause potential moisture problems in the insulation and  dust on the foil surface may reduce its reflective properties.  </P> <P> The easiest do-it-yourself method to apply the foil to the bottom of the roof  rafters is with a heavy-duty stapler. Be sure to leave adequate gaps for  ventilation at the edges. Start it on the rafters several inches above the  insulation and leave a several-inch-wide gap at the peak of the roof.  </P> <P> There are many manufacturers and types of reflective foils and the prices vary  from a low of about 13 cents per square foot to several times that much. Make  sure to get a material that is strong enough to hold up. It can be just  heavyweight foil, or be reinforced with film or fibers.  </P> <P> You can write to me for Utility Bills Update No. 070, showing a list of  manufacturers of reflective foils, instructions and diagrams for installing it  yourself, and a small sample piece of reflective foil. Please include $1 and a  self-addressed envelope.

They really eat a lot  of toast.  </P> <P> A: With most kitchen appliances, it is better to make larger quantities of  foods at one time. However, toasters are an exception. It doesn't really make  much difference other than the fights over the first few slices.  </P> <P> Toasters brown the bread with radiant heat from the red-hot elements instead of  cooking or baking it. Therefore, the residual heat in the toaster from adjacent  slots does not toast the bread any faster.  </P> <P> Letters and questions to Dulley, a Cincinnati-based engineering consultant, may  be sent to James Dulley, Los Angeles Times, 6906 Royalgreen Drive, Cincinnati,  Ohio 45244.  </P> <P> </P></p>

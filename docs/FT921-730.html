			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / BMA hits at central elements of reforms THE British Medical Association yesterday rejected the central elements of the government's health reforms at a conference which its leaders had struggled to prevent becoming party-political. Ministers have claimed the reforms, a year old next week, are beginning to win the support of the medical profession. Some BMA members believed that yesterday's conference, arranged before the election was called to discuss the health reforms and a programme for improving health standards in the 1990s, should not have taken place at such a politically sensitive time. But a bid to adjourn it received little support. The BMA is politically neutral, but while overtly party-political points were avoided during the conference, the debate revealed continuing hostility and suspicion among doctors. This will be welcomed by Labour as it maintains efforts to keep health at the forefront of the campaign. The conference adopted resolutions which: warned that widespread GP fundholding would lead to 'fragmented funding, progressive operational instability and no base for strategic and capital planning'; said that the government's internal market would jeopardise the training of junior doctors; declared that no further trust hospitals should be established until the first and second waves had been 'fully evaluated over an adequate period of time and found to enhance patient care'. A motion which sought to give BMA support to separating the purchasing of health care from its provision - the central aim of the reforms  - was defeated. The three main political parties all favour versions of the purchaser-provider split, and BMA leaders clearly expected this to be a less controversial issue. Dr Jeremy Lee-Potter, BMA council chairman, said many people now believed that the 'centralised command economy' of the old-style National Health Service was unsuitable. But Sir Anthony Grabham, one of the BMA's most distinguished council members, said doctors were now 'in an inappropriate commercial competition'.</p>

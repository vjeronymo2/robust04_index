			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 20 KYODO -- Six defectors from the  Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and an independent formed a new  parliamentary group Wednesday [20 April], while three others  from the Japan New Party (JNP) also launched a new group.    The bigger group that combines seven members of the House of  Representatives announced the inauguration of "Jiyuto" (Liberal  Party) at a news conference.    Six members -- Koji Kakizawa, Seiichi Ota, Shokei Arai,  Shizuo Sato, Taku Yamamoto and Kenzo Yoneda -- left the main  opposition party earlier this week expressing support for former  Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe's bid for premiership. The  seventh person, Sanae Takaichi, was an independent.    Kakizawa, a former parliamentary vice foreign minister,  heads  the new party.    Meanwhile, the three JNP defectors, all House of  Representatives members, launched "Group Seiun [Blue Cloud]."    The members are Fumihiko Igarashi, Sakihito Ozawa and Akio  Nakajima, who tendered their resignations Sunday to Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, head of the JNP. The three men, in  quitting the JNP, issued a statement critical of moves toward a  realignment of political parties, as led by Shinseito [Japan  Renewal Party] and Komeito [Clean Government Party].    Jiyuto was inaugurated two days after five other LDP  defectors launched a new party named New Party Mirai (Future) on  Monday. In the upcoming Diet election to select a successor to  Hosokawa, Jiyuto is expected to field its own candidate.    Since last Friday, 12 LDP lower house members have seceded  from the party.</p>

			<p><P> April 28, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GAS CHAMBER URGED IN VICIOUS MURDER  </P> <P> A judge Thursday recommended the gas chamber for a Palmdale man who contended  that he was possessed by an evil alter ego when he raped a woman, beat her into  a coma, then set her bed afire.  </P> <P> James Scott, 26, was sentenced in 1986 to 26 years in prison for raping,  severely beating and burning 24-year-old Wanda Jensen. But he was charged with  first-degree murder after the comatose victim died in 1987 of complications  from her burns.  </P> <P> The murder charge was heard in a non-jury trial before Superior Court Judge  Margaret M. Grignon, who recommended the death penalty Thursday. Grignon will  review the case before she imposes final sentence on May 18.  </P> <P> Scott surrendered to Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies four days after the  April, 1986, attack on Jensen.  </P></p>

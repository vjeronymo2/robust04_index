			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Row over T-shirt design set for High Court hearing WHILE rows over copyright in the fashion industry are common, disputes are usually settled out of court. But changes to the legal aid system may make it harder for small designers to fight their corner in the manner of Antoni &amp; Alison, the London fashion house. Antoni &amp; Alison was supported by legal aid at a preliminary hearing this week in the High Court. It is claiming copyright infringement over a T-shirt produced by Giorgio Armani, the Italian fashion house. Armani has withdrawn the disputed design in the UK and ceased using it in advertising, but Antoni &amp; Alison is seeking a High Court ruling to prevent it being sold or used overseas. The High Court agreed to hear Antoni &amp; Alison's allegation that Armani has infringed its copyright. The case will probably be heard in September. Lawyers estimate that the case will cost each side about Pounds 50,000. Armani's global annual turnover is thought to exceed Pounds 300m while Antoni &amp; Alison's sales were less than Pounds 250,000 last year. Armani has declined to comment on any aspect of the case. Mr Achilleas Constantinou, head of the Fashion Designers Protection Association, says he sees about 100 cases of alleged copyright infringement every year. However, he says 99.9 per cent of cases are settled out of court 'because in a genuine case of copyright infringement one side is lying. What happens is that the bigger party often uses expensive legal muscle to frighten the potential plaintiff into dropping the action.' Lord Mackay, the Lord Chancellor, has proposed that the level of disposable income at which an applicant is entitled to free legal aid be reduced from Pounds 3,060 per annum to Pounds 2,213 per annum from April. The Law Society, the solicitors' governing body in England and Wales, says this would remove 7m people from eligibility.</p>

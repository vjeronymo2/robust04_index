			<p><P> January 26, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COURT DENIES APPEAL OF BRUTALITY RULING  </P> <P> The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals has denied an appeal by the city of Glendale,  letting stand an earlier federal court verdict awarding a Canoga Park man  $60,000 in a police brutality case.  </P> <P> The case involved Paul Valles, who brought action against the city, several  police officers and jailers.  </P> <P> Valles alleged that in November, 1986, Glendale police officers arrested him  illegally, used excessive force and were indifferent to his medical needs in a  one-night stay in jail.  </P> <P> During the trial in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, the officers contended  that Valles had been drunk in a public place and resisted arrest. They tried to  introduce as evidence Valles' prior lawsuit against the Los Angeles Police  Department and statements he made during a previous arrest as proof that he was  biased against police in general.  </P> <P> The judge excluded this evidence, and the jury ruled in Valles' favor. The  decision, filed Tuesday, also awards the legal firm representing the plaintiff  $71,000 in attorney fees, said Valles' lawyer, Stephen Yagman.  </P></p>

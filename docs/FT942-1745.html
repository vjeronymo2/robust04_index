			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Kohl wants early decision on Delors successor Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany last night threatened to call a special European summit as early as next month to settle the succession to Mr Jacques Delors as president of the European Commission. Mr Kohl's move turned up the pressure on Mr Ruud Lubbers, outgoing Dutch prime minister, to withdraw his candidacy either during the two-day summit in Corfu starting tomorrow or soon after. This would clear the way for Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian premier, who is backed by France and Germany. Mr Kohl was attending a meeting of Christian Democrat leaders in Brussels, which included Mr Lubbers and Mr Dehaene. The deadlock at the meeting appears to increase the risks of an embarrassing stalemate in Corfu at the weekend, though hints of a future compromise emerged. Mr Wilfried Martens, president of the EPP, the umbrella group for Christian Democrats in the EU, said he was 'convinced' that the Belgian or Dutch governments would drop their respective candidates if one or the other was in a 'clear minority'. Belgian officials estimate that they have eight or nine firm votes in favour of Mr Dehaene. The Netherlands and the UK, which supports Sir Leon Brittan, chief EU trade negotiator, are opposed to Mr Dehaene. Spain declared for Mr Lubbers yesterday. Portugal and Italy appear uncommitted. Mr Kohl urged EU leaders to resolve the dispute to avoid a confrontation with the new European parliament, which intends to scrutinise the new Commission president. British Conservative rightwingers last night stepped up pressure on the UK to veto the appointment of Mr Dehaene. The Bruges Group - whose honorary president is Baroness Thatcher, the former premier - said Britain 'must' use its veto to send a message the 'federalist Franco-German axis will not irredeemably dictate the future of Europe'. Meanwhile the row over the way Italy exceeds its EU milk production quota also threatens to disrupt the Corfu summit and jeopardise the agreement reached at the 1992 summit to increase the revenue base from next year. After three days meeting in Luxembourg, agriculture ministers of the 12 looked unable to resolve the controversy. Ministers at the meeting said Italy's delegation appeared to be under instructions from prime minister Silvio Berlusconi to stick to its guns. Two years ago Rome agreed to cut its excess output in exchange for a quota increase tonnes. But in March, Brussels said Italy had not cut enough. Italy then produced new figures saying its output had all along been overestimated. The UK meanwhile had taken the Commission to the European Court, because it had reduced the fine for excess output by Italy. Mr Berlusconi wants the case dropped, and the new quota arrangements made retroactive to take account of the revised output figures. This would wipe out a large part of the fine, a move Germany opposes, saying it would cost its taxpayers Ecu800m. But Italy says that unless it gets satisfaction, it will not ratify the Edinburgh agreement on revenue, necessary to increase flows of regional aid from next year.</p>

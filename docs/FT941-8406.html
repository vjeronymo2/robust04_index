			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family:  Directors' transactions The reporting season has not yet really started and many directors remain constrained by their closed seasons. Buying remains muted, but some sizeable sell transactions have been noted. Rodime has interests in computing. In August, three members of the board - including Malcolm McIver, the non-executive chairman, managing director Peter Bailey and James Swent, a non-executive director, bought more than 7.2m shares at 8p each. The share price performance has been prodigious since then, and the sale of more than 2.6m by the same three directors was made at 44.75p. The shares have come back a little and are trading now around 38p. SJPC 1990 used to be known as St James' Place Capital and is associated mainly with Lord Rothschild as his investment vehicle. The other large shareholder is Nils Taube. Recently, he announced his intention to retire and has now sold more than half his holding, a total of 2.5m shares. Clive Gibson also sold stock, partly on behalf of his family trust.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------   DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                        No. of Company                Sector      Shares   Value    directors  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Allen                   BCon        7,500       15         1 Archer Gp Holdings      Insu       50,000       36         1 Avesco                  Mdia       82,649      109         1 Blick                   E&amp;EE      100,000      530         1 Burtonwood Brewery      Brew      172,000      303         1 Concentric               Eng      241,364      632         1* Daily Mail&amp; Gen Tst     Mdia        2,000      263         1** Domino Printg           E&amp;EE        2,786       14         1 Electron House          Dist      130,000      209         2 Fairline Boats          L&amp;Hl       51,000      194         2 Fortune Oil             OilE    2,000,000      140         1 Ivory &amp; Sime            OthF      125,000      299         1* John Menzies            RetG       35,000      235         1* Powell Duffryn          DivI        1,500       10         1 RCO Holdings            SSer        4,000       16         1 Rodime                  OS&amp;B    2,627,830    1,176         3 Sage Group              SSer        4,000       23         1 SJPC 1990               OthF    4,278,737    7,616         2 Smith (DS)              PP&amp;P      178,581      921         3 Soundtracs              E&amp;EE       44,000       34         1 Stanley Leisure         L&amp;Hl        5,130       16         1* Tams, (John) Group      HGod       12,000       12         1 Vosper Thornycroft       Eng        1,600       12         1 Westbury                BCon        6,500       14         1  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- AIM Group                Eng      100,000      152         2 Forte                   L&amp;Hl        5,000       13         1 Goode Durrant           Tran       30,000       53         1 Owners Abroad Gp        L&amp;Hl        8,061       10         1 Scottish Nat Tst        InvT      500,000      529         1 Smithkline Beecham      Phrm        2,531       11         3****  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Value expressed in Pounds 000s.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- **A non-voting;  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- ****incl.

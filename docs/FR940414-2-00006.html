			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Policy_Forest Service Manual Chapter 2640 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Note: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  The Forest Service organizes its directive system by alpha-numeric codes and subject headings. Only those sections of the Forest Service Manual including policy direction that are the subject of this notice are set out here. The proposed policy includes minor revisions to existing codes and subject headings. The audience for this direction is Forest Service employees responsible for coordinating wildlife management on National Forest System lands with State fish and wildlife agencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2643_Applicability of State Fish and Wildlife laws and Regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Forest Service actively cooperates in the development of State fish and wildlife laws and regulations and may assist in the enforcement of State fish and wildlife laws on National Forest System lands. Pursuant to FSM 2610, Regional Foresters shall ensure that memorandums with State fish and wildlife agencies recognize the role of the Forest Service in cooperating in the development of State fish and wildlife laws and regulations, especially those addressing hunting, fishing, and trapping as they would apply to occupancy and use of National Forest System lands. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2643.1_Hunting, Fishing, and Trapping Regulations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Hunting, fishing, and trapping of fish and wildlife and associated practices are permitted on National Forest System lands subject to State fish and wildlife laws and regulations, unless one or both of the following apply:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. State fish and wildlife laws and regulations conflict with federal laws; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. State laws and regulations would permit activities that conflict with the land and resource management responsibilities of the Forest Service or that are inconsistent with forest plans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2643.12_Use of Bait for Resident Game Hunting <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The use of bait as a lure or attractant for the purpose of taking resident game on National Forest System lands is considered a hunting practice subject to State regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Where State hunting regulations prohibit the use of bait, the practice is prohibited on National Forest System lands. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Where States permit the use of bait for attracting resident game, this activity is allowed on National Forest System lands, subject to State hunting laws and regulations, unless the authorized officer determines on a site-specific basis that there is a need to prohibit or restrict the practice of baiting because one or more of the following circumstances exist: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The State laws and regulations on placement of bait are inadequate to protect forest land or other resources or users in a particular location and/or to prevent trespass or litter;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Baiting is inconsistent with the applicable forest plan; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The State laws and regulations conflict with Federal law, such as the Endangered Species Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the mandatory causes for prohibiting or restricting baiting, the authorized officer also may prohibit baiting, regardless of the adequacy of State regulations, based on consideration of the likely impact of baiting on such matters as water quality, public health and sanitation, the potential for litter, or the potential to threaten the viability of wildlife. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Where the authorized officer determines that baiting is a significant problem and should be restricted or prohibited:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The officer shall notify State fish and wildlife officials and provide them the opportunity to resolve the issue through further restrictions or the prohibition through State regulation rather than for the Forest Service to issue the restriction or prohibition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. If the State does not revise its regulations to adequately regulate or restrict baiting, the Forest Service authorized officer shall, time permitting close the area or otherwise restrict baiting by issuing an order pursuant to 36 CFR part 261.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Where time does not permit closure of an area to baiting because the hunting season is underway and it would be impracticable to issue a closure order, the Regional Forester or Forest Supervisor shall take such mitigation and/or enforcement measures as are appropriate and practicable to ensure consistency with forest plan management direction and compliance with Federal laws, orders, and regulations, and protection for forest users and resources. For example, the agency may close a road or gate, or cite violations of other State or Forest Service regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Closure is not the only way to address the practice of baiting. It is expected that land managers as part of their day-to-day management of National Forest System lands and resources will be cognizant of the effects of hunting activities and take such proactive measures, after consultation with the responsible fish and wildlife agency, such as hunter education, as may be necessary to ensure resource protection consistent with forest plan management direction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This policy, in and of itself, does not compel an authorized officer to undertake a specific decision or to make a determination of whether baiting is allowed in the those States where the practice is permitted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Special use authorization shall not be issued for placing bait on National Forest System lands for hunting purposes (36 CFR 251.50(c)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the purposes of this section and to assure consistency in coordination of national forest wildlife matters with State agencies, the authorized officer is the Regional Forester or Forest Supervisor responsible for executing memorandums of understanding with the State wildlife agency. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;9014 Filed 4&hyph;13&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 3410&hyph;11&hyph;M <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

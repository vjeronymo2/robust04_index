			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Observer: Out of step What must the rest of UK industry make of yesterday's ceremonial marking the opening of Smith New Court's latest London headquarters? Prime Minister Major was on parade with an army of City dignitaries led by the governor of the Bank of England, adding to the perception that SNC is one of Britain's great success stories. Perhaps it is, in City terms. But for a company with a market capitalisation of under Pounds 40m, and an annual staff bill more than twice the combined pre-tax profits and losses of the last five years, such pageantry seems over-blown. Doubtless the razzmatazz has something to do with having ex-politicos such as Peter Walker on the board. But one wonders why the star cast is so reluctant to turn up at opening ceremonies for much bigger and more successful companies outside London.</p>

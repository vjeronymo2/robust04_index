			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Observer: Right turkeys Now desperately trying to cobble together a standby facility with the International Monetary Fund, Turkey is paying the price for what looks like an unfortunate lapse in its contributions to the Washington institution in years gone by. The monies member countries pay in - normally based on the size of their domestic economy - determine how much they can subsequently draw out. So when officials sat down to discuss the credit, both sides were more than a trifle dismayed to discover that Turkey's entitlement is smaller than that for Romania, or for Pakistan, or for the Czech and Slovak republics taken together.

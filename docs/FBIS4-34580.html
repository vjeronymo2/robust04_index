			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 17 Jun (NA) -- The chairmen of Radical  Civic Union [UCR] party districts stated on 17 June that their  party "is poised to once again become a government alternative  and a real and credible option." They labeled the current  administration "incapable" of solving the problems confronting  the country.    Party leaders on 16 June held a plenary session convened by  the Political Action Committee presided over by Cordoba Governor  Eduardo Cesar Angeloz. They issued a document on 17 June in  which they stated that "the UCR faces two challenges -- to  reorganize the party and achieve its unity, and to become an  alternative within the opposition. [no closing quotation marks  as received]    They stressed that the establishment of the Political Action  Committee "is a signal to society and to the party itself that  the UCR is capable of overcoming differences."    The document went on to say that "we are seeking to  reestablish unity within the party, a party in which different  styles and leanings may coexist with one another, but which  presents a united front when it has to define a course of  action, measures, and a national model."    Each of the 24 party district chairmen took the floor at the  plenary session to present an analysis of each province's  economic, political, and social situation. Commenting on these  presentations, Angeloz said that some of them "painted pictures  that made one's hair stand on end."    Having analyzed the social, economic, and political  situation  of each province, as well as the party situation in each  district, the document underscored that the UCR "is poised to  once again become a government alternative."    It contended that "the government, which offers stability,  is  incapable of offering Argentines a formula to meet the country's  main necessities: genuine growth and active social policies."    In conclusion, the document stated that "the UCR is again in  a position to represent the dynamic forces of society, and is  ready to transform and modernize Argentina."</p>

			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / International Company News: Shell Forestry rationalises in NZ SHELL Forestry, a subsidiary of the international oil company, has sold its 40 per cent stake in Baigent Forest Industries to Carter Holt Harvey as part of a rationalisation of its once substantial New Zealand forestry assets, writes Terry Hall in Wellington. Carter Holt Harvey, which is controlled by a consortium of US-based International Paper and Brierley Investments, announced yesterday that it was buying the half share of Baigent Industries that it did not already control. Carter Holt Harvey said that it was paying NZDollars 105m (USDollars 58m) for the shares held by Shell and the 10 per cent owned by Todd Forestry, a New Zealand-owned company. Baigent owns 28,269 hectares of forests in South Island and a modern sawmill which produces 140,000 cubic metres of timber a year. The company is upgrading the mill at a cost of NZDollars 4m.</p>

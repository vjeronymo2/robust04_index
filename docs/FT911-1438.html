			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / British Gas workers reject strike BLUE-COLLAR workers at British Gas have voted overwhelmingly to reject strike action over a 9.5 per cent pay offer, says the GMB general union, the main union representing the 27,500 craft and manual workers. Official ballot figures will not be announced until Tuesday but the GMB said it was clear from a preliminary count that there would not now be industrial action. Unions are likely to accept the pay offer but could still decide to pursue a claim for a shorter working week and consolidation of bonus payments. GMB and TGWU general union leaders had previously warned of 'potentially damaging industrial conflict'. The threat of a strike at National Westminster Bank was also withdrawn yesterday in spite of a narrow vote in favour of industrial action by members of the banking union Bifu. The ballot result, described by the union as 'non-viable', was on the basis of a low turnout. NatWest told its 80,000 UK staff last month that it was imposing a 7.5 per cent pay rise and introducing more flexible working hours.</p>

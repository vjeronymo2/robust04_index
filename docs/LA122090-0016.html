			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. TROOPS IN SAUDI ARABIA  </P> <P> In response to "Volunteer Force: Is It Truly Fair?" (Column One, Dec. 6):  </P> <P> You missed half the population in asking the question, who will die if fighting  starts? Why are women not required to register for the draft as all men are?  Why aren't women required to show responsibility to defend this country as all  men are?  </P> <P> Women ask for their rights and an end to bias against them.  </P> <P> They desire both. But they should also ask for the responsibility of at least  having a card that identifies them as ready to help this country in need. And  please note, they don't have to go to the front lines, but can provide other  valuable service.  </P> <P> There is no excuse for not extending conscription requirements to women. It is  an old saying, in dreams begin responsibilities. It is time to provide women  with not only their rights, but with their responsibilities as well.  </P> <P> DAVID H. SIEGEL  </P> <P> Arlington, Va.  </P></p>

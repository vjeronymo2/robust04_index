			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Demand for crude tankers set to rise The oil tanker industry is poised for recovery following a slump which has lasted for most of the past 20 years, according to a review of the tanker market by Petroleum Economics, a consultancy. The rates paid to charter tankers increase sharply when surplus capacity falls to 50m dead weight tons (dwt) and this threshold appears set to be breached shortly, the review said. A drop in the rates paid on the spot market in the early 1990s led to a sharp increase in the number of older vessels being scrapped while fewer new vessels have been ordered over the past three years. If the Opec oil producers increase their shipments next winter, demand for tanker capacity will rise, it forecast. Oil output from wells outside the Middle East is running close to capacity so any disruption to those supplies could only be matched by increased output from the Middle east. Transporting oil on long-haul routes from the Gulf will increase tanker demand. The tightening up of environmental legislation in the US, in particular, has made it less attractive for large oil companies to own their own fleets of tankers. The amount of company-owned tonnage has fallen from around one-third in the early 1970s to one-quarter. At the same time low rates in the spot market have meant the oil companies and other charterers have increased their activity in the spot market and reduced the number of long-term charters. The volume of tonnage on spot charter rose from 10 per cent to 50 per cent while long-term charters fell from 50 per cent to 20 per cent. This dependence on the spot market is expected to lead to fierce competition among charterers for vessels when demand increases. This will push charter rates up higher than would be the case if there was a greater volume of long-term charters. Charter rates for a modern 250,000 dwt 'supertanker' are forecast to rise on the spot market from Dollars 13,000 a day this year to Dollars 21,000 in 1995 and Dollars 30,000 the following year, the review said.

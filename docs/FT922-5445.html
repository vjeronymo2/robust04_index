			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / How To Spend It: Uncrushable suit, lightweight shoes and .. cleft stick - Globetrotting journalists do not need collapsible canoes - they travel light, says Nicholas Woodsworth, who has been scouring London's specialist shops for clothing and other items that a writer might need in his rucksack BEFORE William Boot, newly-appointed foreign correspondent of the Daily Beast, set off on assignment to a distant corner of Africa, he made his way to a London outfitter and ordered what he believed to be tools vital to his trade - a dozen cleft sticks with which native runners could carry his despatches to the outside world. But that was not all. Put into the hands of the efficient shop assistant Miss Barton, he ended up with the essentials that no modern traveller could be without. 'By the time she had finished with him, William had acquired a well-, perhaps rather over-, furnished tent, three months rations, a collapsible canoe, a jointed flag staff and Union Jack, a hand pump and sterilising plant, an astrolabe, six suits of tropical linen and a sou'wester, a camp operating table and set of surgical instruments, a portable humidor, guaranteed to preserve cigars in condition in the Red Sea, and a Christmas hamper complete with Santa Claus costume and tripod mistletoe stand, and a cane for whacking snakes.' Evelyn Waugh's description of travel haberdashery in his satiric novel Scoop is tongue-in-cheek, but not altogether unrealistic. Just 50 years ago, when the British empire still stained maps red from Guyana to Rangoon, travel was far removed from the casual, light-weight affair it is today. Administrators, soldiers, and civil servants went out to the colonies by the thousands. They travelled by sea, and although the wealthier ones went posh  -port out, starboard home - to avoid the worst of the tropical sun, weight allowances were such that no one had any excuse not to bring out with them all the formal accoutrements of their age and social class. Dinner jackets might not make as much sense as sarongs in the dank jungle heat of the Malayan night, but shed so much as a cummerbund and Reggie, Biffy, Pongo and the others might never ask you to play a chukka with them again. Times have changed. For most of us, steamer trunks, collar studs and personal valets have long disappeared, and what we can take abroad to wear is limited by a 20-kilo air allowance. Nor are the fashion dictates of the age quite as rigorous as they used to be - we travel mostly now for leisure and relaxation, and in most situations it is perfectly acceptable to dress with that in mind. Britain, in fact, is one of the last strong-holds of a more formal style of casual attire; on seaside promenades, in hotel lounges, on informal evenings out, Britons on holiday at home will wear jackets and ties where Frenchmen or Americans would not dream of it. But even if you want to join the jeans and rucksack set - and most people do not, for this would be almost as limiting as travelling with formal evening wear only - selecting just what to bring along remains something of an art. A compromise between what you would like to have with you and what is practical to take, it can make the difference between a wholly successful and a wholly miserable trip. Some of the things people take are neither practical nor attractive. Any time I pack a bag and feel the slightest hesitation over any article, I cast my mind far back to a disastrous trip home from Sri Lanka after a theft from a bus roof had left me with no baggage at all. Preferring to spend most of the funds I had left on a cheap Aeroflot ticket, I put the money saved into the hands of a Colombo tailor, who, it turned out, was far better at talking than sewing. I ended up spending two days in Moscow in February in a bright and baggy salmon-pink tropical suit, borrowed red woollen socks, and sandals. It was an outfit so horrible that Muscovites simply refused to acknowledge my existence. Bemedalled officers on icy streets stared straight through me. The lady at the Bolshoi box office declined to sell me a ticket. Waitresses refused to notice me. The memory is enough to make me put any article not entirely appropriate back where it came from at once. Most questions of travel clothing and accessories, of course, are solved with common sense. We know if we are going to be in a hot country or a cold one, in a sophisticated city, at an elegant country resort, or on a rough, deserted trail far from civilisation, and we dress accordingly. A few reminders, though, might be useful. Never take more than you can comfortably carry. You may not be planning a dash across the roof of the world, but the length of a Roma Termini railway platform can seem just as daunting if you are loaded down and in a desperate hurry. While wheeled suitcases do help and are fine for screaming across slick floors at Heathrow, not even Nigel Mansell could get the same luggage to roll an inch at airstrips in Borneo, Katanga, or the Sierra Madre. The old rule of thumb still applies: pack your bags with as much as you think you need, then remove half of it. Most things you can buy at your destination. If Malaysians live perfectly happy lives in sarongs, it is because such wear is eminently suited to their surroundings. No one suggests you go native, but wherever you travel there are lots of locally made items of clothing that are cheaper, better adapted to the immediate environment, and more easily available than those at home. And if you insist on having western consumer goods, there are very few places in the world where you cannot now purchase them. Never buy third world footwear. This is the one great caveat to local shopping. If there is an item that precisely indicates a nation's level of development more surely than any World Bank study, it is shoes. Under-developed countries produce under-developed footwear, and nothing can ruin an exotic place more quickly than seeing it at a painful limp. Here is one area where good old American know-how is invaluable. I never travel anywhere without my Rockports, the lightest and most comfortable shoe I know. Subscribe to fashion that is current and local. If you are going to St Tropez, Gstaad, or some other fashionable watering hole, and want to be as 'in' as you can get, do not buy your clothes in London before setting out. You may pay a little more buying a summer outfit at Naf-Naf on the Vieux Port, but you can be sure it is up to the minute. Avoid ostentation. In many parts of the world, both developed and under-developed, travelling about with expensive clothing, video cameras, costly watches and jewellery conspicuously displayed can not only set you apart from the people you are trying to get to know; it can also set you up for a mugging around the next corner. Simplicity and restraint, then, would seem to be the key to successful travel. But there is more to it than that, as I discovered when wandering around several London shops specialising in travel-wear and accessories. By using high-tech fabrics, light-weight materials and a bit of ingenuity, you will find that even a small suitcase can hold everything you need to withstand trials from desert sand storms to ambassador's garden parties. Begin, for example, with the case itself. There are myriad bags for every purpose, but at The Survival Shop - the closest you will come these days to the colonial emporium of old - you can get a very presentable and practical suitcase and rucksack in one. Unzip the side panel of several models of Lowe or Wolfskin cases and suddenly you have a rucksack with comfortable interior tubular frame and padded shoulder straps. Prices range from Pounds 65 to Pounds 140. Natural fibre or polyester? For years the debate has raged, proponents of cotton and wool saying that wearing synthetics in the tropics is like wearing a sweaty plastic bag, supporters of polyester claiming there is nothing like it. In Piccadilly's Airey and Wheeler - a shop specialising in a wide range of men's tropical suits - I was shown a Pounds 185 businessman's pinstripe suit, of polyester and wool, which can be machine washed. Their best selling single item, though, is the Pinfeather suit, a polyester-cotton mix which, they claim, is uncrushable, machine-washable, does not require ironing, and can even be bunged into a tumble dryer. Very popular with hard-travelling, hard-nosed journalists, this indestructible outfit is the sort of thing Superman would wear when his own gear is at the dry cleaners. I, too, own a Pinfeather, but in weaker, more sensitive moments tend towards natural fibres. They may not survive a suitcase as well, but they are light, they breath and above all, they look and feel comfortable. For those with both fashion and comfort in mind, I would recommend Travelling Light, a specialist company which deals in smart casuals in light cottons, twills, linens, silks and woollens for both men and women. The debate, however, may soon be irrelevant - science is evolving a wide range of man-made materials that are tough, light-weight, wind and water-proof, easily washable and still have the advantages of natural fibre. For example, Gore-Tex, the bonded membrane that allows body-generated vapour out but not water in, can be applied to much softer, more fashionable material. Polyester 'fleeces', worn under porous waterproof shells, now provide greater warmth than wool with a fraction of the weight. Cotton ventile, used by RAF pilots, is warm and windproof, but can breathe. Waterproof hydrophilic-coated jackets weighing only half a pound can be fitted into you pocket. Pertex, by allowing perspiration to evaporate by capillary action, permits the wearer great exertion and warmth without discomfort. For those intending climbing, walking and camping holidays, the Survival Shop and the Youth Hostel Association's Adventure Shops are good places to become familiar with such high-tech products. My greatest surprise in wandering around London's travel and leisure shops, however, came not from the ultra modern but from a rather old-fashioned establishment, Farlows of Pall Mall. It is the sort of place where country aristocracy bump about looking for beagle-motif ties to match their tweed shooting jacket and breeks. There, in a rack of walking canes in a corner, stands a cleft stick. I did not enquire into its function, so delighted was I to find it. Do not despair, William Boots of the world, there is hope yet. This weekend I am off to find a collapsible canoe. The Survival Shop, 11-13 West Colonnade, Euston Station, London NW1 2DY, tel 071-388-8353.

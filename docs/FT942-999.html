			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Europe's most respected companies: 637 companies judge their competitors - Peter Martin outlines how the survey was conducted The survey was conducted by selecting the largest companies in Europe. To do this, we started with the FT 500 list of Europe's 500 largest publicly quoted companies (measured by market capitalisation), then searched other databases to add large privately-owned and state-owned companies. To ensure that the exercise was a true pan-European survey, we compared each country's number of companies with its share of European gdp. Where countries were under represented, we searched out and added more companies. The final list - 637 companies - strikes a balance between representing countries fairly and ensuring that all participants are large, well-known companies. The companies were then divided into industry sectors, starting with the classification used for the FT 500, but amending it to amalgamate some of the smaller sectors. The aim was to produce sectors in which all the members would see each other as competitors. In most, though not all, cases this aim was achieved. Some companies are significant players in a number of fields - this was found particularly in the chemicals and pharmaceuticals sectors. In this first year of the survey, it proved too complex a task to include companies in more than one sector, although a small number of exceptions were made - in the chemicals, pharmaceuticals and household sectors, where some duplicate listings were allowed. Once the sectors were chosen, we wrote to the chairman, chief executive and finance director of each company, asking them to name their most respected competitors from the list we provided of companies in their sector. The letters and accompanying questionnaires were in the main European languages. The questionnaires asked executives to vote for their best (and, if they wished, the second-best) company/competitor from the list, judged on seven factors of excellence: customer focus, people, products and services, business performance, leadership and management, strategy, and environmental issues. We encouraged them to indicate the qualities which contributed to these judgments. We also asked them to nominate the European company they most respected, regardless of industry sector. To improve response, we followed up with reminder letters and phone calls. At the end of the exercise, we were confident that the letters had reached the appropriate people, and that where no reply had been received it was because it was not company policy to reply, or because, as one executive put it 'I don't know enough about my competitors to answer'. Once answers had been received, we entered them into a database and carried out a number of analyses, of which some of the results are shown on these pages. A few industry sectors produced relatively poor responses, and were omitted from the detailed analyses. The selection of the two winning companies was based on their clear lead over their rivals in the overall voting, within their sectors, and on each of the seven dimensions of excellence. Though both companies won votes from outside their home countries, Marks and Spencer had particularly strong support in the UK. ABB attracted a diverse spread of voters. As the table shows, most of the top 25 companies were able to draw on substantial cross-border support. The top 25 companies, almost all of them household names, are drawn from nearly every country in western Europe, and represent a wide range of industry, management styles, and approaches to business.

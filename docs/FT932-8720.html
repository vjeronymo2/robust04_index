			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Accountancy ex-investigator to face probe A FORMER head of the investigations committee of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales has been called to appear before its disciplinary committee. The institute said yesterday that its disciplinary committee will study the 'supervisory responsibilities' carried out by Mr Brian Worth when he was in charge of the investigations committee. He was also chairman of Clark Kenneth Leventhal (CKL), an international association of accountancy firms. The inquiry follows the conviction for forgery and deception at the Old Bailey three years ago of Mr Nick Young, a former executive director of CKL based in London. The case has been referred to the disciplinary committee by the institute's investigations committee, which has judged that there is a case to answer. Mr Worth resigned from the investigations committee in late 1991 when it began examining the case. Mr Young, who was not an accountant, used CKL's address and its stationery as part of a scheme which attracted more than Pounds 7m from more than 70 investors over 10 years. While claiming to invest money in offshore trusts offering high rates of return, Mr Young was actually spending it on a system of horserace betting which he believed he had perfected while attending Cambridge University in the 1960s. Mr Richard Hornsby, the chairman of the CKL victims' group - which represents those who gave money to Mr Young - said that he drew comfort from the referral decision. Five writs claiming Pounds 7m plus interest have already been issued. A further writ for about Pounds 1m is expected shortly. Mr Worth said yesterday that he also welcomed the proceedings as a chance to clear his name. He said that the CKL committee was spread around the world and that Mr Young was the association's only employee in the UK. He said that he had only met Mr Young once or twice each month. More than 60 CKL investors are pressing ahead with legal action for compensation against CKL and Clark Whitehill, its British associate member. A hearing for the action is scheduled for the end of the year. The institute's disciplinary committee is expected to meet to hear Mr Worth's case in September.</p>

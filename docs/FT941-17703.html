			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Right way to run a lottery and the premium bonds (2) Sir, Am I alone in feeling that the decision to change the premium bond prize structure is likely to be counter-productive ('Top bond prize will rise to Pounds 1m', December 17). Certainly my reason for holding premium bonds is so that I have some chance of winning an amount of cash which, while it will not dramatically change my life, would be sufficient to improve the lifestyle of my family. As far as I am concerned National Savings should increase the number of Pounds 100,000 and Pounds 50,000 prizes rather than reduce them in order to produce a 'millionaire' winner as a marketing gimmick to compete with the pools and the national lottery. Surely National Savings could fund a 'unique selling point' which would attract people such as myself who, strangely enough, do not want to be millionaires.

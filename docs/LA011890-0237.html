			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> INDUCTEE SIMON REFERS TO 'OTHER HAPPY' PAIRS IN ROCK HALL OF FAME  </P> <P> Paul Simon said he and Art Garfunkel would feel at home in the Rock and Roll  Hall of Fame, noting that their relationship was rocky.  </P> <P> "We can join those other happy couples," he said at Wednesday night's induction  ceremony.  </P> <P> "Ike and Tina Turner, the Everly Brothers, Mick (Jagger) and Keith (Richards),  Paul (McCartney) and all of the other Beatles."  </P> <P> Despite their breakups, Simon called Garfunkel "my oldest and best friend" more  than once during his speech at the annual black-tie dinner at the  Waldorf-Astoria.  </P> <P> Hank Ballard, who wrote "The Twist," cried as he accepted his award. He said  his wife, who also served as his manager, was killed in a hit-and-run accident  in New York three months ago.  </P> <P> "When she took me on four years ago, she swore she was going to take me back to  the stars where I used to be," he said. "It's tragic she's not here tonight  with me."  </P> <P> Besides Ballard and Simon and Garfunkel, the acts inducted were the Four Tops;  the Who; Bobby Darin, who died in 1973; the Four Seasons; the Kinks, and the  Platters.  </P> <P> The irreverent Kinks wore tuxedos to be inducted.  </P> <P> "Seeing everybody makes me realize rock 'n' roll has become respectable," Ray  Davies said. "What a bummer."  </P> <P> After the ceremony, about 60 musicians, including Bruce Springsteen, Roger  Daltry and Peter Townshend of the Who, hopped up on stage for a jam session.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Miloslav Frydl: "Three Schools To Remain"] </F>   [Text] By 1 September 1994, the advanced military  education system is supposed to be reduced. As of that date,  however, three advanced military schools will remain. During the  meeting of the Education Committee of the parliament of the  Czech Republic, it was noted last week by the rector of the  Advanced Military School for the Ground Forces at Vyskov,  Lubomir Odehnal.    The idea of a unified defense university, about which we  wrote in A REPORT two issues ago, is, according to L. Odehnal,  by far not as topical now as it was several weeks ago. "It could  be the final goal," noted the rector from Vyskov. "But work on  the concept is in fact beginning from scratch. There will  probably not be any specific changes in our orientation, but we  shall be a lot wiser by the end of April."    L. Odehnal further stated that the last consultation with  the  minister resulted in a decision to move the deadline for  transformation to 1 September 1995. But the definitive project  for transforming military education must be submitted to the  Education Committee of parliament by 30 April 1994, according to  the resolution adopted last week by the deputies. "Everything  that could have been said has already been said; now it is time  to finally act," noted Kozel, chairman of the Education  Committee.    We asked Jiri Pospisil, first deputy minister of defense, if  the proposal to transform the advanced military education system  is in such a state that it could be submitted to the Education  Committee by the date specified. "Yes. There are a number of  alternatives; discussions are continuing. I liked what the  chairman of the committee said--it is time to submit some kind  of results. It can be done by the deadline."    At the moment, Pospisil does not know whether the required  proposal will contain the idea of a defense university. "I  believe that it might be the case," he said in response to our  question. "But, in my opinion, the basis for the transformation  is a meaningful system, and it is essentially unimportant  whether it will be divided into a single element or into three  elements."    According to Pospisil, the final version of the proposed  transformation of the military education system is to be  submitted to the advisory board of the minister by the end of  March. According to the Vyskov rector, the final language is  expected to partially take into account the original proposal  formulated by the commission of rectors of advanced military  schools: "Some of the material will be utilized, some will be  reworked. We will most likely not back down from adhering to  advanced school principles. The toughest nut will be finding a  common path for the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of  Education, and the General Staff. The material to be presented  to parliament by 30 April will contain a schedule for  transformation, with a deadline for realization by 1 September  1995. Much will depend on whether this schedule will be  adopted," said L. Odehnal.</p>

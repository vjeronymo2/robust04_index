			<p>BFN     [Text] Umtata April 13 SAPA -- All members of the Transkei  Defence Force [TDF] were ready for integration and  wholeheartedly welcomed the political changes in the territory,  TDF head General T T Matanzima said on Wednesday [13 April].  Speaking at special passing out parade in Umtata, he said TDF  members would use their professionalism and training to defend  the transition to a free South Africa. "The primary mission of  a new and integrated national South African Defence Force [SADF]  will be the defence and consolidation of our democracy in South  Africa. Once successful here we will extend this mission on a  continental level to friendly and peaceful relations in the  world."    Gen Matanzima also said that because of its limited  resources, the TDF had been directly dependent for training on  the SADF. He thanked the SADF for their assistance, especially  in sophisticated technical areas. "We could have benefited more  from these courses but the use of Afrikaans (as medium of  instruction) did make these training projects particularly  difficult than they otherwise could have been."    On Thursday the head of Transkei's Military Council, Major  General Bantu Holomisa, will preside over a ceremonial lowering  of the Transkei flag to symbolise the territory's  reincorporation into South Africa.</p>

Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> OC JAIL GUARD FIRED IN 5 ESCAPES  </P> <P> A guard at Orange County Jail has been fired for failing to follow "procedures  and policies" with the result that five inmates escaped Nov. 20, according to  the Orange County Sheriff's Department. An investigation into the actions of  five other guards continues.  </P> <P> Sheriff's Lt. Dick Olson declined to identify the deputy, who had been with the  department since 1986. Olson also declined to specify the grounds for the  guard's termination. His was the first investigation to be completed, Olson  said.  </P> <P> All but one of the inmates who fled Nov. 20, 1988, have been caught. The  inmates escaped by cutting a hole in a fence and lowering themselves from the  roof of the four-story facility with a rope made of sheets.  </P> <P> Still at large is Michael Taylor, who had been arrested for robbery. He was  identified by a jewelry store owner in Chicago three weeks ago as the armed  robber who made off with $450,000 in gold and diamonds.  </P></p>

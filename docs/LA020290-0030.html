			<p><P> February 2, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SDSU HOPES TO OFFSET SHORTFALL IN FOOTBALL  </P> <P> The San Diego State athletic department fell $151,000 short of anticipated  football ticket sales revenue last season but expects to make up much of the  difference from increased revenue and savings in other areas, the department  reported Thursday.  </P> <P> The department received approximately $1.27 million from football ticket sales,  less than the department budgeted but more than officials said they feared they  might raise before they launched a late-season plea for public support.  </P> <P> The department reported it expects to make up much of the lost revenue with a  slight increase in basketball ticket sales, better-than-expected revenue  sharing of the football bowl receipts with other Western Athletic Conference  members and a reduction, caused by attrition, in the amount spent on athletic  scholarships, primarily in football and women's basketball.  </P> <P> Athletic Director Fred Miller said the department also expected to realize a  savings of $34,000 from other budget reductions and to raise $100,000 in the  first five months of its marketing venture with the Murrieta Hot Springs Resort  in Temecula. The venture provides for the resort to make a donation to the  department fund-raising effort with the purchase of a 30-day package. Miller  said these measures should allow the department to balance its 1989-90 budget  of $4.76 million.  </P> <P> The report was made at a regular meeting of the Intercollegiate Athletic  Authority, the advisory board that oversees the department. The board approved  a modified department budget for the 1989-90 fiscal year, incorporating the  changes.  </P></p>

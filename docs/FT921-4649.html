			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Cray pays Pounds 17m for Autofile Cray Electronics, the software systems, telecommunications and instrumentation group, is paying Pounds 16.8m for Autofile, a software specialist best known for its ATOP holiday reservation system, writes Angus Foster. Cray also expects to pay its first dividend since 1989 when it announces results for the year to end-April. The dividend was suspended after new management under Sir Peter Michael took over the company, which had been rocked by overspending and overstated profits. Autofile made pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.3m from sales of Pounds 16.1m last year. More than 80 per cent of sales were due to ATOP, which is used by tour operators like Owners Abroad and Virgin Holidays. Cray will pay for the purchase through the issue of 27.8m new shares. A total of 4.2m shares will remain with Autofile's existing shareholders, mainly senior management. A further 23.6m shares are being placed by SG Warburg and offered to Cray shareholders on the basis of one new share for every 4.5184 existing shares at 61p.</p>

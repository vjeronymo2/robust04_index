			<p><P> October 21, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY;  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> BRING ON THE CHAIN SAWS FOR A SICKLY 'SOLID OAK'  </P> <P> "Solid Oak," the newest play in town, is, to put it kindly, dead wood.  </P> <P> Bring on the chain saws.  </P> <P> The only question about Robert Mearns' play at the Gaslamp Quarter's newly  named Elizabeth North Theatre is whether this world premiere is ready for  burial, or if it might exhibit some signs of life pruned back to one-act size  -- the length of all of Mearns' previous plays.  </P> <P> But even this question is strictly academic -- a mere detail for the coroner's  report. There's no life stirring here now.  </P> <P> The story, ostensibly, is about an old man who wants to give a solid oak table  to two brothers as a keepsake, to remind them of his message that "God is  within." One brother, Darryl, says thanks. The other, Sonny, says thanks, but  no thanks -- he'd rather sell the table in his antique store.  </P> <P> Then they argue about giving, keeping and selling the table, reiterating the  same arguments over and over for a numbing 90 minutes, during which audience  gazes have a way of surreptitiously stealing to the exit doors.  </P> <P> It's not even as if you can expect any great revelations at the end. This is a  lot like waiting in a line at Disneyland only to find that, just when it's your  turn, they've canceled the ride.  </P> <P> The failure of the play has less to do with the production values -- always  professional at the Gaslamp's two beautifully appointed theaters -- than the  choice of script. It's the latest in a bewildering battery of bombs that have  betrayed a curious predilection for plotless, talky tales all year.  </P> <P> Maybe the Gaslamp should have continued extending its one hit this year, "I'm  Not Rappaport," and canceled the rest of the season.  </P> <P> Instead, it has provided months of watching professionals try to play  professionally with amateur equipment. It can't be done.  </P> <P> Could James A. Strait have directed "Solid Oak" any differently? Well, as with  the Gaslamp's "The Melody Sisters," which he also directed, he could have  hurried us through it. If you're not going to provide anesthetic when you pull  teeth, at least you can cut the duration of the pain.  </P> <P> David Whitney Johnson, a talented actor, throws his all into Sonny, pulling out  every stop as the angry, sharp-talking salesman who wants something better than  his father had. If the play could be resuscitated, he'd be the man to do it.  But it can't be, and he can't.  </P> <P> Providing earnest support are Kenneth Enright, a veteran of the Chula Vista  Free Shakespeare Festival, amiable enough as the simple-minded brother, Darryl,  and Gordon Benson, who exudes benevolent dignity as the old man, Sam.  </P> <P> Robert Earl's set is elegantly simple, from the sumptuous oak table, supported  by four carved wooden dragons at center, to the curving oak tree, providing  shade behind a spare door frame. Matthew Cubitto's lighting suggests the  delicate shadow of leaves. Only Jeanne Reith's costume choices are puzzling.  Why is Sonny wearing a mechanic's jumpsuit with his name on it if he runs an  antique store?  </P> <P> Next up at the Gaslamp is "Hay Fever" at the Hahn Cosmopolitan, and talky as  Noel Coward is, the difference is that Coward provides well-written, witty talk  and artistic director Will Simpson is a master at  </P> <P> directing such fare.  </P> <P> Next season, too, looks more promising with Alan Ayckbourn, Terrence McNally,  Christopher Durang and Hugh Whitemore on the 10th anniversary bill. The Gaslamp  needs something meaty to revive the confidence of its audiences in the  theater's ability to deliver good work. One can only hope that these choices  will mark a turning point.  </P> <P> Knock on wood.  </P> <P> "SOLID OAK"  </P> <P> By Robert Mearns. Director, James A. Strait. Set, Robert Earl.

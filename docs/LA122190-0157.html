			<p><P> December 21, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SPORTS JOURNAL TO BOOST ITS DAILY PRICE TO 75 CENTS  </P> <P> The National, the financially struggling daily sports newspaper, said today it  plans to boost its daily cover price by a quarter to 75 cents, effective Jan.  21.  </P> <P> In addition, the newspaper said it will test a $1 daily price in one or two of  its 10 metropolitan editions.  </P> <P> It has not yet decided which ones, spokesman Steve Hammond said.  </P> <P> In taking the action, the newspaper said it is following the lead of several  other media companies, including the Wall Street Journal and the New York  Times, that have recently either boosted prices or plan to do so.  </P> <P> Newspaper companies across the country have been looking for ways to stimulate  revenue growth as demand from advertisers has softened along with the general  retrenchment in the economy.  </P> <P> But boosting the cover price may be particularly risky for The National, which  has fallen short of its circulation targets.  </P></p>

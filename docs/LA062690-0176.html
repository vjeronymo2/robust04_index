			<p><P> June 26, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NO SPECIAL SECURITY AT NORMALLY CAUTIOUS WIMBLEDON  </P> <P> Police are being cautious but said today they plan no special security steps at  Wimbledon in response to a terrorist bombing at a posh London club.  </P> <P> Tourists said they are concerned but not enough to stay away from the tennis.  </P> <P> "I thought about it, but you can't go through life worrying about things like  that," said Adelaide Woodward of San Diego. "We choose not to think about  things like that. If it happens, it happens."  </P> <P> Woodward and her husband, Jim, were walking in front of the Carlton Club, the  scene of Monday night's bombing, an hour before the incident, on their way to  see "The Phantom of the Opera." But the possibility that Wimbledon would be a  prime location for terrorists to act didn't scare away the Woodwards or other  tennis fans.  </P> <P> Chief Inspector Ray Dunne, head of police operations for Wimbledon, said no  added security measures are being taken because of the Carlton Club bombing.  </P> <P> "This is a large sporting event and we take the precautions we normally take,"  Dunne said. "You can't guarantee security; that would be a Utopia. You can only  take what precautions you can."  </P></p>

			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / UK Company News: Burmah ahead but warns on German side BURMAH CASTROL, the lubri-cants, chemicals and fuels group, increased pre-tax profits by 8.5 per cent to Pounds 179.6m last year in spite of trading it described as 'no better than in 1991.' Burmah's shares rose 18p to 750p. Sales rose from Pounds 2.22bn to Pounds 2.36bn, and the results benefited from a lower tax charge and a Pounds 3m gain on currency translation. However, the group warned that the trading outlook was tough in Germany, which accounted for about 20 per cent of group business - particularly for chemicals used in the foundry and steel businesses. Burmah said it was about half way through its restructuring of the metallurgical functions of Foseco, the company it bought for Pounds 260m at the end of 1990. Foseco's total manufacturing capacity will ultimately be reduced by up to 20 per cent. To date, six plants have been closed or decreased in scope, and the group will now concentrate on shrinking the European operation. Group trading profit from continuing operations rose from Pounds 203.9m to Pounds 216.9m. Lubricants profits increased from Pounds 130.1m to Pounds 136.5m, with total volumes up 10 per cent and margins well maintained. The group said a particularly good performance was recorded in the US, in spite of the Pounds 6m cost of launching Castrol Syntec, the synthetic lubricant. Asia showed gains in a number of territories. In Europe, good results came from Turkey, Italy and export agencies, but Germany slipped. Trading profit from chemicals was slightly lower at Pounds 36.4m. The metallurgical market declined by 20 per cent, as recessionary pressures increased in both the foundry and steel markets worldwide. Fuels trading profit rose by Pounds 7.4m to Pounds 29.2m. Strong results in Turkey, Sweden and Chile were supplemented by a Pounds 1.9m gain on a public flotation in Turkey of a minority stake in a joint venture there. The net interest charge fell 14 per cent to Pounds 40.7m, and reflected the receipt of business disposal proceeds, tighter control of working capital and lower interest rates. Mr Lawrence Urquhart, chairman, said: 'A clear trend in trading is not yet discernible from the early months of 1993. Consumer markets are in general proving better than industrial and this will underpin Castrol's continued growth. Chemicals will benefit from its reduced cost base. Prospects for the smaller business groups are mixed.' Burmah's tax charge fell slightly to Pounds 79.6m, but the effective tax rate fell from 47 to 43 per cent. By moving Foseco acquisition borrowings overseas to where the principal businesses were located, the group's write-off of advance corporation tax was reduced by Pounds 8m, to Pounds 3.1m. Net borrowings increased by Pounds 15m to Pounds 370m as foreign currency borrowings translated into higher sterling amounts. However, shareholders' funds rose by Pounds 52m to Pounds 548m. Gearing fell from 72 to 68 per cent. Earnings per share rose from 42.6p to 48.7p. A final dividend of 16.5p gives a total for the year of 25.25p (24p). See Lex</p>

			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / International Company News: Shares fall in troubled German metal group Shares in Metallgesellschaft dropped 15 per cent yesterday following the disclosure on Tuesday night that the Frankfurt-based group will have to make fresh provisions to cover newly-identified risks arising from its oil operations in north America. The group's shares fell DM40 to DM220 in after-market trading - a quarter lower than the year's high of DM292 reached last week but still well above the low point of DM175 to which they fell in the aftermath of its DM3.4bn (Dollars 2bn) rescue package this January. The metals, mining and industrial group refused yesterday to put a figure to the new provisions. In its statement on Tuesday it said it planned to sell its 80 per cent stake in the Buderus engineering company and other assets to make the new provisions and cover the costs of further restructuring charges in its German smelting activities. Buderus made pre-tax profits of DM133m last year on sales of DM2.77bn. A manufacturer of heating equipment and other products used primarily by the building trade, it has a market capitalisation of DM1.6bn, valuing Metallgesellschaft's 80 per cent stake at DM1.28bn. The sale of the stake is likely to take place in the next few weeks. 'Metallgesellschaft's problems were meant to have been cleared up,' said one analyst, who predicted that the provision could amount to DM1bn or more. Metallgesellschaft said the new provisions arose as a result of contracts made between MG Corp, a Metallgesellschaft subsidiary in New York, and Castle Energy Corporation, an oil-refinery in which MG Corp owns a minority stake. This has no connection with MG Corp's oil futures trading which incurred total losses of DM2.3bn in 1993-94, bringing Metallgesellschaft to the brink of bankruptcy earlier this year.</p>

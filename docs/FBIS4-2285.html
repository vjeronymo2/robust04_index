			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, April 7 (XINHUA) -- France's Foreign Minister  Alain Juppe has emphasized that his visit to China with Prime  Minister Eduard Balladur is to mainly restore political  relations which had deteriorated between the two countries.    On the eve of Balladur's first official trip to China, and  in  an interview published here today by LE LIBERATION, Juppe said  worsened Sino-French relations caused by France's sale of Mirage  fighters to Taiwan should be past history.    He stressed that France cannot continue discord with China,  citing economic, political, strategic and population factors,  and he suggested that there is no great difference between their  two foreign policies.    Replying to criticism that the four day visit will not bring  a flood of new deals, Juppe said that there is no reason why  France should not develop relations with a country as big as  China but explained that, in his view, this was not a commercial  trip.    "It is to restore political relations." he said. "Reentering  into China's markets requires much work and needs time."</p>

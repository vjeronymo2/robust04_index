			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Minding Your Own Business: A solicitor's paper chase ONCE A firm of solicitors has been paid all its fees and has issued a receipt: 1. Can it be asked to issue all the relevant papers to the clients, not simply a photocopy of the notice of probate being granted? 2. What papers would be involved in the case of my wife who, as sole heir, inherited the right to purchase a council house that her late mother lived in and nothing else since the balance of the 'estate' was negative? 3. Would the solicitors be entitled to make further charges to issue these papers to my wife? 4. To which institution, and department, we should address any further questions? 1. Yes: the papers should be delivered to whoever owns them. 2. Your wife would be entitled to all papers concerning the house to which you refer and all other papers if your wife was also the residuary legatee (ie entitled to the balance of the estate, if there had been assets which exceeded debts). 3. We would not expect the solicitors to make a further charge on handing over the papers, especially if your wife is prepared to collect them. 4. The Solicitors' Complaints Bureau, Portland House, Stag Place, London SW1.</p>

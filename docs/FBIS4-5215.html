			<p>BFN     [Text] New Delhi, April 8 (YONHAP) -- Russian Vice Foreign  Minister Aleksandr Panov said here on Friday that if South Korea  wishes it, Russia would send all those North Korean loggers who  had escaped from their logging yards in Siberia to South Korea.    Panov, now here to attend the 50th U.N. Economic and Social  Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) meeting, told the  YONHAP news agency that there would be no problem in permitting  their asylum in South Korea.    Saying that talks were going on with North Korea over  whether  to continue to keep North Korean logging yards in Siberia, the  Russian vice foreign minister said a new agreement could be  concluded before long taking into account the views of human  rights organizations concerned about the rights of North Korean  loggers.    With regard to his recent remarks that Russia would support  North Korea if it is invaded, Panov said that Russia is the  successor to the former Soviet Union and that the agreements  signed between the USSR and North Korea still remain valid.    "If we repeal USSR-North Korea agreements overnight, it  would  lead to a great confusion," he said. "But, we are  re-interpreting some of the clauses of such agreements now that  things have changed."    Russia is seeking ways to cope with the changed reality  while  keeping the existing agreements without offending North Korea if  possible, Panov said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Georgian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Georgian head of state Eduard Shevardnadze </F> by correspondent Nato Oniani; place and date not given --  recorded]    [Text] Yesterday, Eduard Shevardnadze, the chairman of the  Georgian Parliament and head of state, granted an interview to  Georgian radio and television, which we broadcast late last  night. We are presenting a recording of the interview again.  The interviewer is Nato Oniani, a journalist.    [Oniani] Batono [Georgian polite address] Eduard, a decision  on Georgia joining the CIS caused rather a strong reaction among  our deputies. A view was expressed that Georgia did not have to  look at Russia as a protector and savior, that this was a loss  of the sovereignty achieved in years, that Russia still  continued to try to accomplish its own aims, that is, the  restoration of the Russian Empire and that help had to be sought  elsewhere, because it will be impossible to speak about  friendship with a country that itself prompts the issues to talk  about.    [Shevardnadze] Thank you. I would like the TV viewers to  pardon me for repeating some parts from my speech at the  parliament sitting, because I have had to return to the debates  three times today. I regard this as a landmark in Georgian  history. Those who are more or less familiar with our past and  watch current affairs closely, will agree with me that all these  centuries have been searching times. Friends, allies, and even  protectors have been looked for. This is the fate of a small  country and especially a country occupying a geopolitical  situation like ours. The search is still going on and my  personal decision that Georgia has had to unite -- joining the  CIS is a continuation of this course, of this road, and of this  history.    I am sure that future generations will analyze all this and  will realize that this has been a necessary step to be taken, a  word to be uttered.    What response should be given to those who say that this  will  not solve any problem, or that we have to look for a way for  survival elsewhere, or this is a loss of sovereignty? I have  already given a comprehensive answer to that but I will  reiterate in general terms.    First of all, this is an opportunity to settle fundamental  problems -- how efficiently this opportunity will be used  depends on us as well as on our CIS partners. In the first  instance I mean the economy. The economy will never revive, we  will not reach our desired goals quickly without the CIS. The  documents we have already signed and still have to sign create  beneficial conditions for speeding up economic integration or  rather for the restoration of what had already existed, what we  should not have lost and what we should not have destroyed. But  we destroyed it with our own hands and that is why our economy  is frozen and on a very low level.    Apart from the economy, there are principles and guarantees  for collective security, which will come to effect if not today,  then tomorrow. This is very essential.    In my opinion, it is not serious to speak of the loss of  sovereignty just because a part of the sovereignty is delegated  to the Commonwealth. Georgia is not the only country in this  situation. There are 12 countries in the European Union and  they delegate even more rights to the union. Take the ASEAN, a  brilliant union in the Pacific and Asia, which created a basis  for the revival and prosperity of the once poor countries. A  lot of rights are delegated there also. I can also bring  examples of other regional unions.    There may be discussions, but you have to reckon with common  ground rather than only your personal view, while aspiring to  believe not to share grounds, and just stick stubbornly to what  you consider the absolute truth. I would like to add that when  a politician, and a serious politician at that, takes a  decision, he is obliged to take into consideration current  interests and we have to take into consideration interests of  saving the country.    Today, we are facing the issue of the country's existence or  non- existence and therefore you have to take a decision that  provides the chance of survival. At the same time, a politician  has to think of what will be essential tomorrow, what effects  this present decision will have in five years' time, in 10  years' time, in 20 years' time.    I would say that if the Commonwealth develops in the way all  other regional and continental unions of the world have  developed, I think our step can be justified from the future's  point of view. If it does not develop in this way and it  disintegrates, Georgia eventually will not lose anything. This  is the case when we can gain a lot if the Commonwealth proves to  be a real force and we can lose a lot and even everything if we  do not join.    I would like to tell those who prompt us that Russia and the  CIS are not a salvation and we have to look for other ways: Did  we not look for other ways? Now, finally, my visit to the  United States. Before that, there were my contacts with western,  southern, eastern, northern countries. All ways have been  tried. Some make our situation easier, some actively help us,  but a principal way of survival and salvation has not yet been  found. That is why, being guided by the existing situation, I  have considered it essential to take a decision like this. I do  not think I have made a mistake.    There are talks that Russia cannot be the survival [for  Georgia]. Some say another way. We apparently had to sign an  agreement with Russia but did not have to join the CIS. I do  not think there is any logic in this.    First of all, it is absurd to ignore Russia, whatever  forces come to power there. I believe that whoever argues over  the issue on whether it is necessary to have relations with  Russia, he is very far from reality and very far from politics.    If we agree that Russia is essential [for us], we would  rather have relations with the Russia that is in the  Commonwealth. For instance, do we prefer to be left  face-to-face with a huge state like Russia or is it better to  have a variant when we are in the CIS, and Russia is in the CIS,  too? This means that bilateral relations are arranged and  guaranteed and, at the same time, there are certain guarantees  of security, collective security. I think this is also a more  or less good reason. That is why I could not agree with  arguments in parliament. Although, I have to say that there  were sound ideas in certain speeches and I welcome them.  [transmission then lost]</p>

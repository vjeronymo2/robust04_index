			<p><P> August 24, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> SCHOOL REFORMS BACKED, POLL FINDS  </P> <P> A majority of Americans are ready for "tradition-shattering" educational reform  and would support higher taxes for schools as well as an array of changes such  as a national curriculum and the doctrine of choice favored by President Bush,  a poll showed today.  </P> <P> The 21st annual Gallup-Phi Delta Kappa poll of attitudes on public education  also found Americans still consider drug use to be the major problem facing  their local schools, continuing a trend that began in 1986.  </P> <P> The proportion of Americans giving their local schools a grade of A or B rose  to 43%, up from 40% last year and a low of 31% in 1983. Four percent said their  local schools deserved an F, the same as the last two years.  </P></p>

			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Norway says it will keep currency floating NORWAY said yesterday that the krone, which it uncoupled from the European currency unit on December 10, would continue to float until international conditions permitted a stable exchange rate to be established. Norway was the first Nordic country to link its currency to the Ecu, from October 19 1990. The government said there was currently no basis for re-establishing a fixed exchange rate for the krone, whose value would be determined in foreign exchange markets. Bank of Norway officials said yesterday that the currency had remained stable since the float, in contrast to the currencies of Sweden and Finland, whose values had fallen sharply since they were uncoupled from the Ecu in the autumn. Following the announcement, the krone traded at NKr8.4298 against the Ecu, 5.45 per cent below its former central rate of NKr7.9940. Central bank officials said they were not surprised that the krone, since the float, had fallen little, because Norway's economy is stronger than that of its Nordic neighbours, underpinned as it is by a healthy current account surplus and small public deficit.</p>

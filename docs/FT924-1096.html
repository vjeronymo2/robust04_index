			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Call to alter Pep rules PROSHARE, the body set up to promote wider share ownership, has called on the Chancellor to alter the personal equity plan rules substantially in order to encourage greater investment in equities. Its major proposal is a 'MegaPep' to encourage those who come into lump sums, via inheritance or retirement, to invest their capital in equities immediately. Rather than the present annual limit of Pounds 9,000 (Pounds 6,000 in a general, and Pounds 3,000 in a single company, Pep), the MegaPep would allow an individual to invest Pounds 80,000 over a rolling eight-year period. Existing Peps could be rolled into the new scheme tax-free. ProShare argues that the size of a MegaPep would allow managers to achieve economies of scale and reduce the effect of charges on plans. The cost to the Treasury would not be great, since much of the money going into MegaPeps would consist of switches from earlier Peps. In addition, ProShare wants a tax break similar to the loi monory system in France, with investors able to buy shares out of pre-tax income, subject to an annual limit of Pounds 1,500. An investment like this would, effectively, cost the basic-rate taxpayer Pounds 1,125 and the top-rate taxpayer Pounds 900. Such a system would encourage the small investor, who had previously acquired only privatisation issues, to increase his involvement in the equity market. Last week, a ProShare survey found that only 200,000 of those who bought shares in privatisations had acquired holdings in other companies. A further proposal from ProShare is that roll-over relief should be extended to private investor shareholdings. This would allow investors to postpone paying capital gains tax on a share sale, provided the proceeds were re-invested immediately into equities. A recent study of private investor holdings found that 48 per cent of the value of shares and unit trusts were held in portfolios of over Pounds 150,000. Such holders may be unwilling to sell holdings and incur a CGT liability; this reduces market liquidity. How likely are the proposals to become law? ProShare is not alone in calling for changes to Peps; the Unit Trust Association called recently for gilts and corporate bonds to qualify for Peps, arguing this would help fund the growing government borrowing requirement. But the Chancellor's current priority must surely be a consumer boom, not increased savings. And the UTA's proposal seems set to fall on deaf ears. The Treasury ruled this week that gilt or bond trusts would no longer be classed as part of the Pounds 1,500 'non-qualifying' element of a Pep (previously defined only as trusts with less than 50 per cent of their assets in EC equities). The best hope of change may lie in later years, when GDP is growing again and the Chancellor can afford to tinker with savings plan rules.</p>

			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Saracen to launch Pounds 50m smaller company fund Saracen Fund Managers, a new company set up by a former director of Scottish Amicable, has issued a pathfinder prospectus for an investment trust specialising in smaller companies. Saracen Value Trust aims to raise Pounds 50m through a placing and offer for subscription, sponsored by Charterhouse Tilney Securities. The fund will be invested in smaller companies from the FT-SE SmallCap Index (excluding investment trusts), selected on a value basis, with the aim of achieving long term capital growth. Mr Jim Fisher, managing director and co-owner (with IAF Group) of Saracen Fund Managers, managed the Amicable Smaller Enterprise Trust from launch in March 1992 until September 1993. Saracen said the trust was being launched now because smaller companies were expected to do well with the economy moving out of recession and low and stable inflation.</p>

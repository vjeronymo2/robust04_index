			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An additional cost of this regulation may be an increase in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> iron deficiency anemia if susceptible adults react  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inappropriately to a warning label targeted for children.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> According to NHANES II, approximately 7.2 percent of females age  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 15 to 19 and 6.3 percent of females age 20 to 44 are iron-deficient but less than one-fourth of these women had anemia  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associated with the deficiency. In addition, males had a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prevalence of less than 1 percent. FDA requests comments on this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issue.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  b. Benefits.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Warning statements will only prevent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pediatric iron poisonings to the extent that they lead to changes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the behavior of the adult controlling the use of the product  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (presumably the parent). Whether the warning messages prescribed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in this proposed rule will cause a change in behavior will depend  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on a number of factors, including the degree to which the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statement is noticed, read, and understood.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  There is some evidence that warning statements can change  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> behavior. For example, research indicates that rate of increase  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of sales of diet soft drinks declined after saccharin warnings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were put on the labels of these products (Ref. 38). FDA is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unable to predict exactly how many cases of pediatric iron  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> poisoning will be prevented as a result of warning statements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To the extent that warning statements will cause adults to take  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proper care in handling iron-containing products, and to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extent that such care is not taken in the absence of warning statements, some cases of pediatric iron poisoning will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prevented.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  If the agency requires unit-dose packaging, and this measure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is 100 percent effective in preventing both fatal and nonfatal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cases, then there are no benefits from warning labels on these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products. However, for those products still packaged in bottles,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> warning labels may have an impact. If each nonfatal case of iron  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> poisoning is valued at $20,000 and the one-time cost of warning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statements is $675,000, then benefits of requiring warning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statements will exceed costs if warning statements prevent at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> least three nonfatal cases every year for the next 20 years  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (discounted at 7 percent).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Product Reformulation_Appearance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two petitions recommended product reformulation as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preventive measure. The petitions suggested that some adult  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> formulations of iron-containing products look and taste like  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> candy and thus are more appealing to children. The petitions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stated that if the product were less appealing to children, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incidence of accidental ingestion would be reduced. The petition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from NDMA urged FDA to reject reformulation for several reasons,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including a lack of knowledge about what a pill looks like to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> very young child, and about why the child is motivated to consume  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the product. The agency does not have information to determine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> either the costs or the benefits of reformulating the appearance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of iron-containing products. Because reformulation costs are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> highly dependent on the individual decisions of firms, they are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> very difficult to estimate. Also, because there are currently no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> objective measures of the candy-like appearance of iron-containing products, the benefits are also difficult to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Product Reformulation_Taste  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Another possibility is to add a bitter substance to products  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containing iron which would discourage multiple ingestions. Such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substances have been used in the past on products which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discourage thumbsucking and nailbiting. It is highly likely that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such a substance will not add significantly to the cost of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> producing iron-containing products. FDA requests information on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a policy option that would require altering the taste of iron-containing products. Such information would include the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential substances that would make the pills bitter and data on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their safety and whether this approach would be effective in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preventing acute overdose of iron-containing products by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> children. FDA notes, however, that such an option may have the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unintended side effect of causing persons who need iron  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supplementation to avoid the product. FDA requests information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on both the costs and benefits of this option.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

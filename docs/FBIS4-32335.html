			<p>BFN     [Text] I begin with a report that at least formally puts  an end to the general discussion that has taken place in recent  days and weeks. The president of the republic has issued Decree  No. 141, in which he orders the Law on Amendments and Addenda to  the Bill on Reorganizing and Privatizing State and Municipal  Enterprises to be published in the STATE GAZETTE.    We just received this report from the presidency Press  Center.</p>

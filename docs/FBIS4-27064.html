			<p>BFN     [Text] Governor Ruan Chongwu presided over of the 37th and  38th routine work meetings of the provincial government on the  morning and afternoon of 24 June. At the meetings, the final  draft for deliberation of the Regulations on the Supervision and  Management of Quality of Products of Hainan Province was  deliberated and approved in principle, and issues concerning  development and construction of Yangpu were discussed.  Attending the meetings were Vice Governors Wang Xiaofeng, Wang  Xueping, Mao Zhijun, and Liu Mingqi, and Secretary General Cui  Zongjun of the provincial government. Attending the meetings as  nonvoting delegates were comrades in charge of provincial  departments concerned.    The issue of the quality of products has a bearing on the  immediate interests of thousands upon thousands of households.  Constantly improving the quality of products and ensuring a good  economic mechanism of the special economic region are pressing  needs for the development of an export-oriented economy and for  improving the investment environment in our province. In the  past two years, our province has repeatedly organized  large-scale activities to crack down on fake goods and has made  considerable achievements. However, viewed from the actual  situation, the existing laws and regulations can hardly meet the  need of enforcing laws on supervision over quality. The 37th  routine work meeting held that to promulgate as soon as possible  regulations on the supervision and management of quality with  Hainan's own characteristics was of great significance to  strengthening supervision over quality and protecting  competition on an equal basis according to law.    The routine meeting approved in principle the final draft  for  deliberation of the Regulations on the Supervision and  Management of Quality of Products of Hainan Province. In  addition, the meeting also decided to submit the regulations to  the Standing Committee of the provincial People's Congress for  deliberation and examination after revisions are made.    The 38th routine work meeting discussed issues concerning  the  development and construction of Yangpu. The routine work  meeting held that under the correct leadership of the State  Council and the provincial government, and with the concerted  efforts of the Yangpu Administrative Bureau, businessmen engaged  in the development of Yangpu, and builders of Yangpu, great  changes had taken place in Yangpu, China's first large  development zone being developed by foreign businessmen over a  vast area, and great progress had been made in development and  construction. Major achievements made are manifested in the  facts that the developers have basically fulfilled the contracts  and have invested large amounts of capital in the construction  of infrastructure in the past year and more, and the scale and  speed of construction have tallied with the requirements of land  transfer contracts and agreements on projects. In the Yangpu  Economic Development Zone, the social order is stable and the  people support the development and construction. Domestic and  foreign investors have always taken a keen interest in and a  positive attitude toward Yangpu. However, since the development  and construction of Yangpu have been carried out without the  support of a city or any infrastructure, and have encountered  considerable difficulties, some time is needed. The provincial  CPC Committee and the government will enthusiastically help  overcome these difficulties, for example by linking the supply  of electricity from the Yangpu Power Plant to the major power  grid, by supplying water, and so on. The government will also  enthusiastically coordinate with other sectors concerned to  solve other problems.</p>

			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Brazil's inflation For the first time in years, there is a real chance for Brazil to put an end to its chronically high inflation. Much must still be done to ensure that this occurs, but important groundwork has been laid for a deep and sustainable reduction in an annual inflation rate now accelerating past 2,500 per cent. After six unsuccessful anti-inflation plans in eight years, why should anyone take the latest seriously? The reason is twofold: the plan makes economic sense and politicians, through a chance combination of circumstances, may be disposed to back it. First, the politics. Brazil's president and its Congress - both potential obstacles to economic stabilisation - are currently weak. President Itamar Franco is content to let his finance minister, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, handle the economy. Legislators have been shaken by corruption scandals and their puppet-masters - the state governors - are scared of the popularity of the left-wing presidential candidate, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva ahead of October's elections. The plan is a credible attempt to tackle the underlying cause of inflation - the budget deficit. It also attacks the inflationary psychology and indexation mechanisms which make last month's inflation rate the effective base for next month's inflation. Erasing Brazil's chronic budget deficit is the harder part. The country's 1988 constitution earmarked such a high percentage of federal government revenues that it virtually guaranteed deficits. According to Mailson da Nobrega, an economist and former finance minister, about 98 per cent of Brazil's tax revenues are earmarked for specific expenditures - most of it goes straight to the states - or for wages for government employees whose jobs are legally protected. This leaves the rest for current and capital expenditures, and paying debt interest. A constitutional change passed last week will reduce for a two-year period the proportion of funds earmarked and provides, in the best case, a temporary basis for erasing the budget deficit. The big risk is that in an election year, the government will give in to pressures to spend money. Even if all this works, it is unrealistic to think that Brazil's inflation will be brought down to international levels in one shot. The best that can be hoped for is that the plan buys time to allow the government that takes over next year to complete the task. To do this, it will need the tools. Congress can provide those during the current constitutional revision process. This might include, for example, devolving more functions to the states, which should allow the centre to be placed on a sounder financial footing. It can also reform the political system - with the aim of reducing the fragmentation of Congress and eliminating gridlock. This is a rare opportunity for a discredited Congress to raise its stock with the Brazilian public. It should grab it with both hands.</p>

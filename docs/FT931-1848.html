			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Sunday trading bill prepared A DRAFT bill to reform the Sunday trading laws will be published within the next few months along with a paper about the impact of its provisions, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, said yesterday. It would be made available 'well before' the summer recess, which begins in July, Mr Clarke said. There is no room for the bill in the present legislative session and it cannot begin its passage through parliament until autumn at the earliest. The government is keen, however, to let MPs know the progress that is being made in consulting pressure groups about possible models for reform, in order to maintain the momentum of its proposals.</p>

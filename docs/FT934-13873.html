			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Travel tax 'to make up tariff losses' THE Clinton administration yesterday proposed Dollars 2.35bn (Pounds 1.55bn) in new travel taxes to compensate for the loss of tariff revenue as a result of the North American Free Trade Agreement. It did this even though some Republicans have threatened to oppose Nafta if it leads to new taxes. Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, told the House ways and means committee the entry tax would amount to Dollars 5-Dollars 10 on all aircraft or ocean-liner tickets; Dollars 7.50-Dollars 15 on railroad and Dollars 5-Dollars 10 on commercial vehicles. The revenue-raising method had been selected, he said, because of the close ties between trade and travel. The administration had by law to come up with taxes or budget cuts to replace lost tariff revenue. But, this way, it defied a group of Republicans led by Mr Newt Gingrich, House minority whip, who say they would find it 'difficult' to support a Nafta which includes new taxes. One month before the November 17 House vote on Nafta, the administration is facing numerous such obstacles in its fight to get the implementing legislation approved. Much of its troubles stem from the uneasy alliance in support of the pact. This includes moderate Democrats, at present about one-quarter to one-third of the House Democrats, and Republicans on the lookout for political traps. Worried the administration will pull away from Nafta and they will be left alone in support of an unpopular pact, Republicans have demanded the administration lure at least 100 Democrats to the pro-Nafta side. They also insisted on a labour side agreement that is so weak it has failed to attract the hoped-for union support. Democrats such as Mr Richard Gephardt, House majority leader, have demanded a strong job-training programme. Because this would require more taxes, which would anger Republicans, the administration has proposed only an 18-month Dollars 90m plan with the promise it will propose a more comprehensive programme next year. If, as expected, 145,000 workers lose jobs by 1995 because of Nafta, this 'bridge' plan would provide only Dollars 620.69 per worker, according to Congressman Collin Peterson, a Minnesota Democrat.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V. I. Kozik, P. Ye. Tverdokhleb; UDC </F> 681.325.65:535.232.65]    [Abstract] A method for designing an optical associative  memory device (OAMD) in the form of an integrated microcircuit  using electro-optical thin-film modulators, integrated-optical  splitter, a and light beam integrator is proposed. Estimates are  made of the fundamental parameters of the microcircuit. It is  demonstrated that the OAMD can be made in the form of a  multilayer thin-film structure with optical interconnectors.  Works are carried out now at the Institute of Automatics and  Electrometry practically in all directions of the microcircuit  development. Different models of light beam splitter are being  studied. A splitter mock-up is developed for 16 light beams  exhibiting a nonuniformity of diffraction efficiency smaller  than 5%. Technology is mastered for producing  high-efficiency  diffraction optical elements. Ferroelectric films of strontium  barium niobate are synthesized. A construction is proposed of a  thin-film light polarizer with the polarization ratio of 50:1.  Experimentally, a 20:1 ratio was obtained. Figures 6, references  16: 9 Russian, 7 Western.</p>

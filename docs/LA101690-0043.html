			<p><P> October 16, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEXICO'S TOUGH DRUG CZAR LOSES HIS JOB  </P> <P> Mexico's controversial drug czar, Javier Coello Trejo, was removed from his  post Monday after repeated charges that federal anti-narcotics police under his  authority committed widespread human rights abuses.  </P> <P> Coello, 42, was named Monday night as federal attorney general for the  consumer, a position that officials portrayed as a promotion but which, in  reality, is far less powerful than his old job.  </P> <P> As deputy attorney general since December, 1988, the robust, chain-smoking  Coello has overseen the Mexican Federal Judicial Police assigned to combatting  narcotics production and trafficking. Heroin poppy and marijuana crops are  grown illegally in Mexico, and the country is a major transshipment route for  U.S.-bound South American cocaine.  </P> <P> During Coello's tenure, Mexican police have seized a record 75 tons of cocaine  and jailed drug lord Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo, reputedly the top cocaine  supplier to the U.S. West Coast.  </P> <P> American officials have lauded Coello's aggressiveness in fighting narcotics  trafficking and his close cooperation with the Drug Enforcement Administration.  </P> <P> "He's been great. This is a blow," said a U.S. official. "The whole success of  the large cocaine seizures can be attributed to his planning and management of  these operations."  </P> <P> But at home, politicians and human rights activists have been far more critical  of Coello's leadership. Half a dozen governors have protested violence  committed by the Federal Judicial Police in their states, as has the National  Human Rights Commission, created by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari last  June.  </P> <P> The U.S.-based Americas Watch human rights group issued a report in June  charging that "federal narcotics police are accountable for a large number of  cases of murder, torture and abuse of process in Mexico today. Extortion and  robbery are also frequent elements of federal police operations."  </P> <P> And last month, in special hearings before a subcommittee of the U.S. House  Committee on Foreign Relations, Deputy Asst. Secretary of State Sally G. Cowal  said that "chief among our human rights concerns in Mexico is mistreatment of  detainees by Mexican police, particularly the Mexican Federal Judicial Police .  . . (which) has traditionally enjoyed considerable immunity from prosecution  for its human rights abuses."  </P> <P> Rights activists applauded Coello's removal but said the government must go  further to restructure the police and judicial system, particularly to  eliminate the use in court of confessions extracted in police custody. They  said they believe Coello was removed to ease international criticism of Mexico  as the government tries to negotiate a free trade agreement with the United  States.  </P> <P> A government source said Coello is to be replaced by Jorge Carrillo Olea, an  army colonel who has been serving as director general of national security.  </P></p>

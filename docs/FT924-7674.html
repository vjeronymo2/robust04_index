			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / How To Spend It: A Bavarian Christmas THE STREETS of Nuremberg from the Hauptmarkt to the railway station will be festooned with white poles carrying garlands and lights on November 27, the Friday before Advent. Surrounding a Christmas crib in the centre of the market, fir-clad stalls will be selling decorations, elaborately decorated candles, the work of local craftsmen and women, and comical little figures made of dried fruit and crepe paper called Zwetschgenmannle or plum people. On that Friday at 5.30 pm an elected 'Christchild' will proclaim the start of the city's annual Christkindlmarkt from the balcony of the mighty 14th century church of Our Lady. The sun sets, the lanterns of the stalls are lit and the church is floodlit. So is Nuremberg's stupendous fountain, the gilded Gothic Schoner Brunnen which is nearly 20 metres high and decorated with statues of the German electors, Teutonic heroes and nine Old Testament prophets. Around this fountain children's choirs and brass bands will regale the visitors throughout the Christkindlmarkt. By the time the market ends on Christmas Eve, 2.5m guests will have visited Nuremberg, some 30,000 of them brought in by 50 special trains put on by the German railways, not to speak of 50 extra flights from Switzerland. They come to eat the city's pork sausages which are the size of one's little finger, and another Nuremberg speciality, the honey and gingerbread cakes known as Lebkuchen. They wash down the grub with mulled wine spiced with cloves and cinnamon. Nuremberg's Christkindlmarkt is Germany's oldest Christmas fair. Its origins lie in the mid-1550s, when the Lutherans of the city took to giving their children presents around Christmas. Their canny religious compatriots spotted the chance to make a profit from this pious habit, and by the beginning of the next century traders were bringing toys to sell in the city from as far away as Holland - in particular, the Dutch sold dolls here, known as Docken. These are probably the originals of the Christmas angels made of golden foil which, nowadays, you find throughout Germany. Initially all this commerce and festivity took place at Nuremberg's normal markets, but in 1629 the city fathers decided to set up special stalls in anticipation of a pre-Christmas spending spree. Since then the Christkindlmarkt has never looked back. Special events this year include a lantern procession from the Hauptmarkt to the Olberg on December 12, beginning at 6.15 pm, and followed by a Nativity play. Two days later the celebrated boys' choir of Regensburg cathedral (the 'cathedral sparrows') arrives to sing in the Hauptmarkt at 4 pm. This Christkindlmarkt is the benchmark for a cluster of other fairs which make the run up to Christmas a treat elsewhere in Bavaria. At Munich the Christkindlmarkt, lasts from November 28 to Christmas Eve, developed out of the medieval celebration of the feast of the patron saint of children, Santa Claus (St Nikolaus), which falls on December 6. Later, the stallholders of its thriving vegetable market cashed in on the festival to host a long-running fair. Since 1972 the Christkindlmarkt of Bavaria's capital has centred on the exquisite Marienplatz and its surrounding pedestrianised zone. An enormous Christmas tree decked with countless lights dominates the square with its maze of booths and stalls. The air is redolent with the scent of mulled wine and burnt almonds. On November 28 and 29, Advent carols will be sung here, and on December 17 Christmas carols in the monastery church of St Anna. Not far away at Augsburg, weekend visitors to the Christkindlmarkt (which starts on November 27 and ends on Christmas Eve) are offered a treat that verges on the kitsch. In 1493 Hans Holbein the Elder painted some angel musicians for its cathedral high altar. Today modern Madchen, winged like these angels, their long tresses curled, play lutes for the spectators at the Christkindlmarkt. And even Augsburg's Lebkuchen are baked in the shape of angels. Splendid though these Bavarian cities are, none can match in glamour the town of Rothenburg ob der Tauber, perched above the river Tauber and surrounded by medieval walls. The stalls of its annual Christkindlmarkt, selling candles, gingerbread cakes and every conceivable Christmas decoration, are set up in the Marktplatz, shaded by an arcaded town hall which is half-Gothic, half-Renaissance. On November 27 the Burgermeister and a brass band concert will inaugurate the market, after which festivities will continue till December 20th. Every day either a brass band or a group of singers will perform in the Marktplatz. On Sunday December 13 the slender, late-14th century basilica of St Jakob will host a concert by the Windsbach boys' choir, one of the finest in the region. It's already a sell-out. A week later the basilica is the venue of a Bach trumpet gala, performed by the Trumpet ensemble of Munich. Bavaria's Christmas markets are this year being specially promoted by Lufthansa and DER travel service.</p>

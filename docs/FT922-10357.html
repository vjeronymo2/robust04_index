			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / International Company News: Securities firms to set repo guidelines SECURITIES firms are moving to establish guidelines governing short-term lending between institutions collateralised on securities - known as 'repo' trading by market participants and one of the fastest growing areas of the international bond market. The firms believe that the rapid growth of repo lending means that new guidelines are required. If the industry does not move to formalise best practice, outside authorities may intervene, bankers said. On Tuesday, representatives of more than 20 firms active in the repo market met with officials of the International Securities Market Association, the self-regulatory body for the international bond market under UK law. The firms want to establish a market practices committee within ISMA to set best practice guidelines for the conduct of repo activity. In addition, leading firms have been working with the US Public Securities Agency (PSA) and Clifford Chance, the UK law firm, to draft standardised documentation for repo transactions. Currently, firms use their own legal documents and contracts. Although repo activity has its roots in the late 1980s, the business has mushroomed in Europe over the past two years. Banks and securities firms including Deutsche Bank, Warburg Securities and Banque Paribas have become active in a market formally dominated by the big US securities houses. The result is that institutions in London increasingly fund themselves by borrowing short-term using securities as collateral. Cheaper funding can be achieved from such secured transactions than by borrowing unsecured in the inter-bank loans market. Repo activity carried out in London is regulated by the Securities and Futures Authority. While the SFA has detailed capital adequacy rules for repo transactions, the conduct of business is governed by the authorities' general principles for all securities transactions.</p>

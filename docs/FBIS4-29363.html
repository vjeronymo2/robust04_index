			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 16 KYODO -- Japan's production of  plastic resins in May increased from a year earlier for all four  types of product, the Japan Petrochemical Industry Association  said Thursday [16 June]. It was the first time in two and a  half years that production marked year-on-year gains for all the  four types.    Industry analysts said the increased output signals a  recovery for the slumping petrochemical industry, but the  association said demand for plastic resins is unlikely to make a  full recovery soon.    Production of low-density polyethylene was up 6.0 percent,  high- density polyethylene up 8.0 percent, polypropylene up 3.0  percent and polystyrene up 6.0 percent, the association said.  Production of polystyrene, used in household appliances, hit a  monthly record of 112,700 tons.</p>

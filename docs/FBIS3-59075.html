			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] Called by Carlos Magno the "national  figure of the year" in the 24 December Lisbon weekly EXPRESSO,  newly reelected Porto Mayor Fernando Gomes, a Socialist Party  (PS) luminary, is now generally seen as the North's "new star."  According to Magno, Porto, which needed a leader in 1989 when  Gomes was first elected, identified with the "technocratic  discourse" of this economist and Eurodeputy possessing a "very  short political resume." Following his election, Gomes was  increasingly recognized as a "serious player." It was remembered  that the late legendary PSD leader Sa Carneiro had asked him to  join his Social Democratic Party (PSD) on the strength of his  conviction that "this man will go far." In fact, Lisbon  politicians no longer laugh when Gomes is mentioned as a  possible Socialist Party (PS)leader or even presidential  candidate, Magno comments. The Porto mayor is his own man, he  continues, quoting him as saying that "I did not leave the  European Parliament when the Portuguese Government wished to  push me out, and I do not go where others want to take me."  According to Magno, Gomes is "calmly" preparing his way south to  the capital, but remains fully aware that his "vital space" is  still Porto, at a distance from the seat of government that  enhances his authority. PS leader Antonio Guterres, who called  him a "statesman" during the municipal election campaign, had  nicknamed him "Mr. North" when Gomes helped him wrest the PS  leadership from former secretary general Jorge Sampaio. In fact,  despite rumors that Gomes and Guterres will fight for the party  leadership, nothing points to a duel between the two men, Magno  asserts, noting that while they may fear each other, their  relationship also involves sincere mutual appreciation. Gomes'  real test is still to come, Magno concludes: the sights of a  winner of a string of regional victories in Porto are now  naturally set on more important political battles at the end of  the decade.</p>

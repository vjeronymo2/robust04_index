			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Statement by the `New Regional Policy' Deputies' Group," </F> signed by V.S. Medvedev, leader of "New Regional Policy," and  I.P. Rybkin, chairman of the Russian Federation Federal Assembly  State Duma; no date given; carried under the rubric "In the  State Duma"]    [Text] On 26 April at 2030 hours the life of Andrey  Daynisovich Ayzderdzis, an independent State Duma deputy, was  cut short in his 35th year. He was shot at point-blank range at  the entrance to the ordinary dwelling house in which he lived in  the Moscow Oblast city of Khimki.    Yet another name is entered on the gloomy list of contract  killings increasingly being committed for political motives.  For the first time a deputy of the supreme legislative organ,  the Federal Assembly State Duma, has been murdered. A Russian  citizen has been murdered. A human being, to put it simply, has  been murdered. Insolently. Boldly. Mercilessly.    Once again -- and at the same time, for the first time --  one  of the most terrible crimes against the person, which in recent  times have become a common phenomenon in our country, has been  committed. Once again a challenge has been hurled to society,  the president, the government, and parliament. Once again the  helplessness and impotence of the state, the organs of power,  and the law-enforcement organs in the battle against crime are  revealed in all their nakedness.    Once again we all -- all deputies, the whole nation -- are  persuaded of this through our own bitter experience.    The subsequent inactivity, passivity, and failure to adopt  tough, energetic, and decisive measures aimed at scotching and  eradicating crime and violations of the law place in  ever-growing jeopardy not only the lives of individual people,  but the very existence of Russian statehood itself (in any of  its forms).    Soberly assessing the currently prevailing situation, the  scale of the imminent danger, the bounds which criminal elements  have transgressed, and the possible tragic consequences for the  country's multimillion population, we demand, with all the  decisiveness at our command, that the Russian Federation  president, as the guarantor of human and civic rights and  freedoms, and as himself a citizen, make maximum use of his  constitutional powers for the urgent and uncompromising  imposition of order in this most important sphere of our  everyday life.    We express firm confidence that the first step in this  complex and difficult battle will be the investigation of the  murder of our colleague and the proper punishment of his  murderers.    Criminals and instigators of murders must be found,  convicted, and suffer their merited punishment.    Peace must triumph in our country.    [Signed] V.S. Medvedev, leader of the "New Regional Policy"  deputies' group.    I.P. Rybkin, chairman of the Russian Federation Federal  Assembly State Duma.</p>

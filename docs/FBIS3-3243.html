In September, the  opinion of "adding heat" prevailed again, so various localities  vied with each other to prepare for another "great leap forward"  round.    Some economists note that the economic cycle of  decontrol-chaos and tighted control-stagnation is getting  shorter and shorter. A few months after the termination of the  macro-control policy, phenomena reflecting economic disorder  appeared everywhere, and high inflation had caused the further  deterioration of various social problems. A widening gap not  only exists between rich people and poor people, but also  between the rich coastal cities and impoverished rural areas in  the interior. More and more signs show that if the polarization  of wealth cannot be mitigated in a short time, all kinds of  trouble could break out. The people, especially the peasants,  have a stronger tendency to stage "rebellions."    The central authorities also feel that the situation is on  the brink of going out of control. Recently, a taxation reform  program was hastily put into practice in order to bring the  situation under control and to redistribute wealth through  taxation. After various taxes are raised substantially, wealth  might naturally be shifted from the developed coastal areas to  rural areas in the interior. However, this reform measure is  being resisted by the "local lord economy [zhu hou jing ji 6175  0186 4737 3444]." Some Guangdong officials publicly announced  that they would not collect value-added property taxes due to  special local conditions. Such "defiant" statements caused a  public uproar. Under pressure from public opinion, Guangdong  Vice Governor Lu Ruihua was forced to announce that Guangdong  would abide by Beijing's latest instructions.    The current situation in mainland China is moving from one  extreme to the other. In the past, it was stressed that "the  whole country should be well-coordinated under the central  leadership like pieces in a chess game"; but now, the country is  as loose as a plate of sand.    Facing another round of economic chaos, Vice Premier Zhu  Rongji, who is widely regarded as losing power and influence,  has again frequently appeared on public occasions. The mainland  mass media have carried many reports about his new instructions  on economic work. This indicates that the reform-minded  strongman is again playing a part of "taking on very important  assignments at a time of national crisis."    In mid-January, a four-day national banking work conference  was held in Beijing. Principal officials in charge at various  ministries and commissions of the State Council and provincial,  municipal, and autonomous regional governments attended the  meeting. However, the mainland mass media did not publish any  reports about such an important meeting. It was said that the  central authorities issued an instruction to unify propaganda  practice in order to prevent any reports about financial policy  "upsetting" the people. It was no wonder that the mass media all  exercised "self-discipline" and kept silent, because many  startling facts were revealed at the meeting and it would have  been very "upsetting" if they had been made known to the public.    Zhu Rongji, Zou Jiahua, and Li Lanqing attended the meeting  and made separate speeches. These leaders who are in charge of  economic affairs fiercely criticized the "local lord economy"  and the tough words they used greatly shocked participants in  the meeting.    At the very beginning of his speech, Zhu Rongji criticized  the eight provincial and autonomous regional governments of  Guangdong, Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui, Guizhou, Liaoning, Hebei, and  Guangxi by name. He sternly criticized them for going their own  way, not studying and relaying central instructions, and  knowingly adopting their own policies in violation of  regulations laid down by the central authorities. This was  reflected in the following facts: They continue to raise funds  irregularly, and, in some cases, have even raised interest rates  to 30 percent without regard to the relevant regulations laid  down by the state; they have continued to increase investment in  capital construction without authorization; withheld, concealed,  and shifted foreign exchange earnings by various means; issued  bonds in various forms without authorization, with the amount of  such irregularly issued bonds exceeding 60 billion yuan since  last December; distributed shares of state-owned enterprises to  their workers in various disguised forms; sold new publicing  housing to workers at prices lower than the construction costs;  hoarded major producer goods in order to drive up prices, which  disrupted the overall operation of the market and kept prices of  production materials at high levels; and some provincial  government departments have even delivered false reports and  data to the State Council.    Zhu Rongji also exposed the duplicitous behavior of some  localities in covertly defying and violating central  instructions. He said that some provincial government leaders  have publicly expressed their willingness to follow central  instructions at meetings, but they in fact went their own way  under the pretext of "giving play to local initiative and  creativity," and he described their behavior in defying  organizational authority and discipline as pursuing selfish  local interests and the partial interests of small groups,  upholding individualism and anarchy as emancipating the mind,  and breaking conventions. They have seriously violated the  principle of a subordinate relationship between the central and  local authorities.    Zhu Rongji finally warned: "The central leadership will not  allow some local leaders to use their powers and functions to do  whatever they like in violation of central instructions. Such  leaders must be dismissed from office and will not be forgiven."    The warning to dismiss disobedient officials without  exception shocked those attending the meeting. However, it was  not hard to understand Zhu Rongji's feelings after they had  listened to Zou Jiahua's report about the overall economic  situation. Zou frankly admitted that the overall financial  situation in the market was serious. Although the policy to  strengthen economic macro- control last summer did achieved  certain results in curbing and stabilizing the situation, the  overall financial situation, especially the banking order and  foreign exchange payments, was still imbalanced on the whole.    Zou Jiahua said: The State Council required all provinces,  autonomous regions, and municipalities to submit their reports  on economic construction, reform, and financial conditions in  1993 by 8 January, but seven provinces and autonomous regions  had not yet discussed their reports at local party committee  standing committee meetings, and many provinces and  municipalities had not yet worked out their 1994 work plans. In  that case, how could subordinate localities and units handle  their work, and how could they maintain uniformity with the  central authorities and carry out central instructions?    At the meeting, Li Lanqing called for "setting thinking  right, changing position, and developing the economy." He  explained: In- depth reform cannot rely on the inflow of a  large amount of foreign funds. This is not only because foreign  investment has to be digested, but also because foreign  investment has its limitations. The central authorities will not  relax or change the macro-control policy.    Although "macro-control" was again mentioned at the meeting,  the central leaders really find it a headache to see that the  local authorities had not obeyed their instructions.  Reportedly, in early January, Zhu Rongji expressed his opinion  at a routine meeting of the Political Bureau, and said that  localism and anarchy had made it impossible to ensure the  effective implementation of central measures. Zhu added that  this problem could not lie unsolved any longer and that we  should face reality squarely and adopt organizational measures  to solve the problem, and we must take action before problems  occur to a serious degree. Zhu Rongji also expressed his  feelings of helplessness. If the local authorities refuse to  carry out central instructions and "if they continue to pursue  their own policies without regard to the central authorities,  what can be done?"    In addition to dealing with the serious financial situation  and the "centrifugal" tendencies of local officials, Zhu Rongji  is also facing challenges and pressure from the conservatives.  Recently, Yao Yilin openly challenged him, and asked when  attending a State Council meeting in mid-January: "A vicious  cycle has taken shape in the fields of capital construction,  currency distribution, imports, and credit. Who should bear  responsibility for this? I think no one can bear such  responsibility. Does the comrade who took the decisions bear  such responsibility?"    Yao Yilin also made an alarming prediction: "If the reform  measures do not match national strength and the people's  endurance, the financial situation may continue to deteriorate,  the renminbi may be devalued by a big margin once again, and  serious inflation may occur. If social turmoil happens this  year, it may spread turmoil caused by other factors, and even  riots may occur. The consequences will thus be more serious  than the political riots in 1989."    At present, social pressures have become rather obvious, and  complaints about high inflation have been heard directly by  Zhongnanhai. On the morning of 18 January, Jiang Zemin  inspected Beijing's Wangfujing Department Store and attended a  discussion meeting where worker deputies and party committee  members of the department store expressed five points to the  general secretary. On 20 January, their opinions were published  at a briefing of the General Office of the State Council. There  was a response within two days, and this shows that the opinions  had attracted attention from top leaders. The five points were:    First, prices of grain, cooking oil, and other foodstuffs  are  increasing too quickly, and ordinary residents cannot endure  this and are cursing the Communist Party and the government.    Second, central leaders and Beijing municipal leaders should  care about the livelihood of Beijing residents. Living  standards of retired workers are declining drastically, while  the number of retired workers is increasing.    Third, as grain and cooking oil are sold by the state, how  are their prices raised haphazardly? This has caused a  disorderly situation in the market and serious concerns among  the people. The people's confidence in the government has  dropped.    Fourth, it is said that the working class is the leading  class of the country and that the workers are the masters of the  state. In reality, however, they do not understand government  policies and measures and have no right to take part in the  policy-making process.    Fifth, workers are now complaining that reform is going too  far and that they cannot endure it. This has caused tense  relations between workers and cadres.    Sources in the department store said that when a top  official such as the general secretary came to see them, the  workers did not care about his face. The worker deputies  delivered a petition to Jiang Zemin, which was entitled  "Workers' Voices and Demands." Party committee cadres on the  spot tried to discourage the workers from doing this by saying  that they should deliver the petition to the general secretary  through the party committee, and adding that this was just the  opinion of some workers. A full meeting of workers was not  held. Such remarks aroused indignation among the workers, and  the atmosphere became rather tense. This made it hard for Jiang  Zemin to back down with good grace, and he could only say that  worker deputies represent the voice of all workers.    A similar event occurred again on 22 January. When Jiang  Zemin attended a discussion meeting of workers from some  industrial enterprises in Beijing, deputies from the  construction, chemical, and textile industries delivered a  petition to him. According to an internal newsletter, worker  representatives in some trades strongly demanded that workers'  views should be reflected in the management of enterprises, that  the interests of the vast number of ordinary workers be cared  for and protected, and that the income gap between party and  administrative cadres and ordinary workers in enterprises should  not be widened further in the course of reform.    Data showed that in the construction industry, the income of  party and administrative cadres was 120-300 percent higher than  for ordinary workers. In the chemical industry, wage ratio  between cadres and workers was 2.3 to 1, and for bonuses the  ratio was 4 to 1. Worker deputies from the textile industry  said at the meeting: In the city, some 100,000 textile workers  do not work full hours, and their status is at the third tier  under the party committee secretaries and factory directors at  the top and department and workshop heads in the second tier.    Resentment against the corrupt practice of seeking private  gains by making use of official functions and powers and against  the widening gap between rich and the poor has become a serious  social problem. According to the General Office of the Beijing  Municipal CPC Committee, between last November and mid-January  this year, Beijing municipal government leaders held discussion  meetings in 120 factories, enterprises, and shops in order to  discover workers' feelings. Beyond their expectations, over 60  percent of worker representatives required that the pace of  reform be slowed down, because workers could no longer endure  it. Some worker representatives even said that ordinary people  did not care whether there was reform or not; if they could not  endure it there would be strikes, and they could take to the  streets to stage demonstrations and even rebellions.    For the CPC leadership, the situation has become more  serious  than previously, and signs of "turmoil," which they are most  afraid of, have appeared. The Mayor Li Qiyan of Beijing  recently admitted at a bureau-level cadre meeting that workers  are very realistic. If they cannot endure, they will curse the  government and the Communist Party and could even take to the  streets to stage demonstrations. He also revealed that last  year, strikes, go slows, mass rallies, and petitions occurred in  more than 40 factories, mines, business enterprises, and  institutions. The Beijing Municipal CPC Committee and the  Beijing Municipal Government received more than 1,200 complaint  letters signed collectively.    What Li Qiyan revealed was just the situation in the capital  where the central leaders live. The situation in other places  can be imagined. As Deng Xiaoping's days are numbered, will the  CPC leadership be able to withstand the impact produced by  reform? Economic reform has brought about certain threats  against the authoritarian rule of the CPC. Will it continue to  advance or will it backtrack? It seems that the answer will be  found this year.</p>

			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / World Bank set to lend India Dollars 3.2bn THE WORLD BANK is expected to lend India more than Dollars 3.2bn (Pounds 2.1bn) in the year beginning April 1993, including concessional assistance of Dollars 1.3bn from the International Development Association (IDA), the Indian Finance Ministry said yesterday. Mr Ernest Stern, the World Bank's managing director, said after an hour-long meeting with Dr Manmohan Singh, the Indian finance minister, that the bank would also grant India's request for an annual Dollars 2.5bn in exceptional financing over the next three years. Mr Stern, who is in New Delhi for a fortnight, said that India was meeting the conditions of a World Bank structural adjustment loan. The World Bank is also providing a Dollars 500m loan to support reforms in the trade sector. Bank officials said India's tariffs were among the highest in the world. But a tax reforms committee, headed by noted economist Dr Raja Chelliah, has already recommended a substantial reduction in the average tariff rate to 25 per cent by the fiscal year 1997-1998, and a maximum rate of 50 per cent. India's aid donors and the Bank's management have also given overwhelming support to a Dollars 500m loan, approved in December, to provide a social safety-net programme for former workers in India's unviable public sector enterprises. This, said Mr Stern, represented the continued commitment of the international community to ensuring that the burdens of the transition process did not adversely affect the poorer sections of society.</p>

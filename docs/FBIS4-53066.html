			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 17 KYODO -- The leader of the Liberal  Democratic Party (LDP) on Tuesday [17 May] told Prime Minister  Tsutomu Hata the main opposition force will demand the prime  minister's resignation after the fiscal 1994 national budget  clears the Diet, a senior LDP official said.    "When the budget is acted upon, we will again call on you to  shape up," LDP President Yohei Kono said in a meeting with Hata  in an indication that the LDP will submit a no-confidence motion  against the Hata cabinet.    Kono also noted the Hata administration is "a government  under abnormal circumstances" and urged Hata to be aware that  his government is a minority one, Yoshiro Mori, LDP secretary  general, told a news conference.    The remarks apparently reflect the LDP chief's belief that  the Hata cabinet will have completed its duties when it passes  the key budget through the Diet.    Kono, responding to the prime minister's call for the LDP's  cooperation in Diet debate on the long-overdue budget, revealed  his party is ready to cooperate in an active manner if the  government admits its responsibility for the delay in budget  discussions.    Hata also called on the LDP to extend a helping hand to the  coalition government on political reform and tax system reform,  Naoto Kitamura, deputy chief cabinet secretary, told a separate  news conference.    The prime minister, who leads the first minority government  in 39 years, spoke pointedly of the need to enact a bill that  demarcates a new constituency map for House of Representatives  elections, according to Kitamura.    The encounter between Hata and Kono is the first since Hata  took to the helm of the government on April 28. Hata was  accompanied by Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai and  Kitamura, while Kono attended along with Mori and LDP Diet  Affairs Committee Chairman Sadatoshi Ozato.    During the one-hour meeting held in the Diet building, Hata  also reiterated there is no backpedalling in his government's  policy of charting a course for sweeping tax system reform by  the end of June so as to enact necessary legislation by the  year's end.    While the premier expressed his determination to carry out  drastic deregulation, the LDP leader showed willingness to  cooperate in reviewing economic regulations, Kitamura said.    On former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's alleged  involvement in improper financial dealings, Kono pressed a  demand the government agree to summon Hosokawa to the Diet as a  sworn witness, Mori said.    Hata's meeting with Kono was the first in a series of  meetings with leaders of political parties outside the ruling  coalition.    The premier also was to meet later Tuesday with Social  Democratic Party Chairman Tomiichi Murayama, New Party Sakigake  Leader Masayoshi Takemura, and Michihiko Kano, head of the new  party Mirai.</p>

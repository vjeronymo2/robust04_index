			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARTIN SCORSESE'S OBSESSION  </P> <P> So Martin Scorsese "is considered the most interesting and talented director in  America, if not the world" ("The Passion of Martin Scorsese," by T.J. English,  Sept. 23).  </P> <P> Please correct me if I'm wrong, but the last time I looked, Woody Allen,  Francis Ford Coppola and Stanley Kubrick are still making movies.  </P> <P> And Ingmar Bergman, Federico Fellini, Akira Kurosawa and David Lean, while not  as active as they once were, are still alive.  </P> <P> STEVE BARR  </P> <P> Culver City  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Riga, May 18, BNS -- The Latvian Cabinet approved  Tuesday [17 May] a bill on obligatory social insurance in the  case of unemployment, stipulating to maintain the jobless from a  special employment fund.    Both employers and employees must perform obligatory  payments  into the fund, under the draft law.    The state insures persons at its maintenance, including  soldiers in armed service, days students over the age of 15,  mothers with children under 3, and inmates of penitentiary  institutions.    Persons, for whom the insurance payments have been made, are  entitled to allowances for a period of nine months, according to  the draft law.    The amount of the allowance depends on the amount of the  recipient's average wages over the last six months, as well as  on the length of insurance. For example, persons with insurance  term of one to one and a half years will receive 50 percent of  their average allowance in unemployment allowance.    The allowance payments also depend on the length of  joblessness. The allowance is paid fully in the first three  months after a person loses job.    Then it gradually reduces to 60 percent of the initial  payment but the amount of money paid should not be smaller than  90 percent of the official minimum wages.    State insured persons receive 70 percent of the official  minimum wages in unemployment allowance, the bill said.    In another action, the government confirmed the statutes of  a  Social Insurance Council. The council is designed to draw up  recommendations for insurance funds, Welfare Minister Janis  Ritenis told reporters after the government meeting.    The council will consist of nine officials, from which three  will represent employers, three -- employees and three -- the  government.    Ritenis claims that the setup of the council will ensure the  participation of employees, entrepreneurs and the government in  the development of the social insurance system.</p>

			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Abbey's bad habit Abbey National's Pounds 101m windfall from last year's share sale is a curse as well as a blessing. It has provided elegant camouflage for the cost of getting out of estate agency. Net exceptional debits for last year amount to only Pounds 37m, but the gross charge for restructuring the estate agency business was Pounds 138m. Factor in accumulated losses since 1988 and the total cost of this particular venture becomes Pounds 226m. That adds up to a gross strategic blunder which, sadly, Abbey now risks compounding. The timing of its windfall has encouraged it to put the agencies up for sale at what must be about the bottom of the market. This is a poor advertisement for Abbey's strategic sense, especially since it coincides with growing loss provisions in Europe. Abbey has a deservedly high reputation as a mortgage bank. But, with the exception of the treasury business whose expansion has about run its course, its attempts to diversify have disappointed. Perhaps insurance will prove otherwise. One must hope so since the mortgage business seems set for a lean 1993. The Pounds 62m general provision will help smooth the effect of the abnormally high net retail margin which Abbey enjoyed as interest rates came down in the second half of 1992. This year, provisions are likely to remain high while the net retail margin will be squeezed. Supporters will argue that the bank has plenty of scope for dividend growth. That is an old story, though, and already in the price.</p>

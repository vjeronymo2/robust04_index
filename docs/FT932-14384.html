			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Belgian Government Bonds: Investors sense stark sentiment change FOR THE first time in years, uncertainty, scourge of the financial markets, is stalking Belgian government bonds. The change in sentiment is all the more striking because it followed a new year surge of investment, encouraged by the authorities' informal commitment to keep the franc close to the D-Mark. By January, the yield on the 10-year Belgian benchmark bond had narrowed to 40 basis points over its German equivalent, compared to a spread of more than 120 basis points last August. But speculative challenges to the currency in February shook the Belgian franc's reputation as a surrogate for the D-Mark. Then, at the end of last month, Belgium's fragile centre-left coalition submitted its resignation after failing to agree on how to curb the growing budget deficit. In the event, it took only a week for Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the prime minister, to forge a new agreement on austerity budget measures, aimed at raising or saving some BFr113bn up to the end of next year. The Belgian National Bank, keen to revive confidence, was able to drop interest rates back to below pre-crisis levels. But although the government has avoided elections and agreed an austerity package, the bond market could take much longer to recover. Belgium is a small country, often riven by disputes between Dutch-speaking Flemings and French-speaking Walloons. In theory, its financial markets are accustomed to political turmoil. What makes the latest crisis different is that it has drawn investors' attention to worsening public finances, and has raised questions about the federal future of the country. Belgium's budget deficit last year rose to BFr485bn, or 6.9 per cent of gross domestic product. Other economic indicators - such as inflation and current account surplus - look healthy, but analysts expect total government debt to increase by at least the same amount again this year. Meanwhile, plans to devolve more powers to Belgium's regions have raised fears that regional governments will allow debt to spiral out of control, and increase the possibility of Belgium splitting into two or more feuding regions. In fact, the constitutional reform proposals which are passing through the national parliament will hardly alter the central state's control over public finances. But the effect on bond market sentiment has been dramatic. The yield spread on the 10-year bond rose to 90 basis points over the German 10-year bond at the height of the crisis, slipping back to 80 basis points by last week. The question is whether the government's austerity package will bring the deficit down to 5.8 per cent of GDP this year and 4.7 per cent next, as it has forecast. Analysts think not. They fear some of the most important measures will not be implemented quickly enough to put Belgium back in line with the EC's target for monetary union of a 3 per cent deficit-to-GDP ratio by 1996. JP Morgan warns that yield differentials with Germany could return to three figures. 'I don't see a lot of upside potential, and a lot of downside if things are seen to be going wrong,' says Mr Jacques Longerstaey, head of bond sales and trading with JP Morgan in Brussels. On the other hand, Mr Roger Rosier of the Belgian bank, Generale de Banque, believes an 80 basis point spread over German bonds makes Belgian government bonds quite attractive. But he agrees the yield spread is unlikely to narrow to less than 75 basis points, and could rise as high as 100 in the coming months. In the meantime, the government is not afraid to introduce two new bonds at its next auction on April 22. One of those - carrying a 7 per cent coupon and maturing in 2004 - is expected to become the new benchmark 10-year bond. As Mr Rosier of Generale de Banque points out: 'It's obvious that the mini-crisis we have seen has raised certain questions. People will definitely watch what's going on very closely in future.'</p>

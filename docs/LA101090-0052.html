			<p><P> October 10, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: CHULA VISTA  </P> <P> A Chula Vista woman surrendered without incident to SWAT officers early Tuesday  after an all-night standoff that involved the death of one man, police said.  </P> <P> The names of the woman and the dead man were being withheld pending  notification of next of kin, Lt. Dean Girdner of the Chula Vista Police  Department said.  </P> <P> It is believed the man and woman lived together in the apartment at 1450  Melrose where the standoff occurred, Girdner said.  </P> <P> Police were called to the apartment about 9:30 p.m. Monday to investigate a  report of shots being fired, Girdner said. When they arrived, a woman pointed a  rifle out her window and fired a couple of random shots, he said.  </P> <P> Police blocked off the area and called in a SWAT team and hostage negotiator,  Girdner said. For several hours, negotiators used a bullhorn to communicate  with the woman because there was no telephone in the apartment, Girdner said.  </P> <P> About 5 a.m., two rounds of tear gas were shot into the woman's apartment and  she surrendered a short time later without incident, Girdner said. In the  living room lying on the couch, police found the body of a man who had been  shot more than once, Girdner said.  </P> <P> The woman was taken to the County Jail at Las Colinas.  </P></p>

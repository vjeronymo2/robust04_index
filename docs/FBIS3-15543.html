Over 90 percent of the participants  pronounced for Moldova's territorial integrity, stated today to  the National Radio Mihai Coscodan, chairman of the Republic  Commission for running the poll, Moldovan vice premier.  Coscodan said the poll will be a heavy blow for separatists in  Tiraspol and Comrat. Previously, Ovidiu Badina, director of  Sociological Service for Researching the Public Opinion and  Market (SCOP), told BASAPRESS that the scientific value of this  poll is null since the two rules essential for any poll are not  respected -- the question is not formulated exactly; it consists  of several components and it is not clear to which of the  answers "Yes" and "No" refer.</p>

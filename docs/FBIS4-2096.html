			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, April 1 (XINHUA) -- "China is a prospective  economic partner of Poland," Boguslaw Liberatzki, Polish  minister of transport and maritime economy said today.    Back from his official visit to Beijing, Boguslaw predicted  that by the year 2000, trade volume between the two countries  will recover to the level of 1986 and stabilize at 1 billion  U.S. dollars.    1991 witnessed a sharp decline in bilateral trade when the  trade volume dropped to 140 million dollars, down 71 percent  from the previous year.    In face of the widespread recession in Western Europe and in  an effort to get new international market, Poland found a new  partner in China. In 1993, by developing new forms of  cooperation beyond barter trade, Poland and China greatly  augmented economic and trade exchanges and investment in each  other.    The trade volume in 1993 climbed to 400 million dollars and  is expected to rise steadily in 1994.    Closer contacts between the two governments also facilitated  the further development of their trade and economic ties. A  Polish vice prime minister visited China in June 1993, in return  for a visit made by his Chinese counterpart Zou Jiahua to Poland.    Some provinces in China have sent their own trade  delegations  to Poland during the past year.</p>

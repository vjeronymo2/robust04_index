			<p>BFN     [Text] Pretoria May 4 SAPA -- Unauthorised aircraft would  not be allowed to fly over Pretoria during the inauguration of  the state president on Tuesday [10 May] next week, the South  African Air Force [SAAF] announced on Wednesday.    The SAAF said in a statement the occasion could lead to an  influx of aircraft wishing to observe the ceremony from the air  with "the inherent danger of an accident being ever present".  "It should be quite clear that flight safety is of utmost  importance and cannot be compromised in any way. It has  therefore been deemed appropriate to keep the skies over  Pretoria as uncluttered as possible."    At the request of the national inaugural committee's sub-  committee on security, the air space over Pretoria would be  strictly controlled during the inauguration.    Only flights specifically authorised by the Air Force would  be allowed to enter Waterkloof air space or operate South of  Wonderboom airport during this time. "The necessary  co-ordination mechanisms between the SAAF command post and air  traffic control at Wonderboom have been established. In  addition to static radar installations, a mobile unit will be  deployed to ensure unbroken coverage at both high and low level.  The SAAF will place its own aircraft on standing air patrols to  enforce the measures," the statement said.</p>

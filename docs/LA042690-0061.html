			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS  </P> <P> Pacific Enterprises: The Los Angeles conglomerate, which owns Southern  California Gas Co., Thrifty Corp. and Pacific Enterprises Oil Co., posted  earnings of $68 million, up slightly from a year ago. Revenue totaled $1.91  billion, a gain of 3%. The results were attributed to an improved performance  at SoCal Gas, a 2% rise in Thrifty sales and higher oil prices, offset by  higher depletion expense and lower oil and gas production.  </P></p>

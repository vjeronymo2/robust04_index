			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Jauhari Teguh Sugiharto] </F>   [Text] Jakarta, Jan 28 (ANTARA) -- Aceh fishermen have  come out from silence to vent anger at the increasing number of  foreign poachers in their waters by throwing molotov cocktails  at intruders.    They even threatened to use guns if the foreigners insisted  on entering the area without permission.    Seemingly, the action comes as a call for more attention to  preventing poaching cases in other waters of this archipelago,  right from its westernmost province of Aceh to the easternmost  province of Irian Jaya.    The fishermen's action has caused some officials to urge the  government to take necessary measures.    Aceh regional House of Representatives' Commission B  secretary Fuad Zakaria said the government should pay special  attention to the problem.    "It is now high time that security forces intensify their  patrol of Aceh waters and if poaching continues, the central  government in Jakarta should send protests to countries  concerned," he added.    Aceh is not the only victim of poaching. Foreign fishermen  have also intruded into North Sumatra's waters and South  Sumatra's Bangka and Belitung Islands.    Reports from Bangka said that tens of foreign fishermen were  left unrestricted to operate in the region. Apart from the  indiscriminate exploitation of marine resources, their  operations also destroy the fish's natural habitat and  frustrating local fishermen from their income.    Head of South Sumatra police public relations chief  Lieutenant Colonel Syahrifudin Madri Gumay said that action has  been taken with the arrest of a foreign trawler.    "Together with the special waters police, we constantly  supervise the waters around Bangka and Natuna Islands and will  continue to seek more information on the foregin fishermen," he  said.    An official of the local waters police, Police Captain R.  Nasution confirmed that there have been reports of the increased  poaching by foreign fishermen in Indonesian waters.    He said a Task Force has caught a foreign trawler red handed  with a dead weight of 99 tonnes. It carried a number of foreign  crewmen.    "We found tonnes of fish catch, large trawling nets and  corals as evidence," he said, adding that other fishing ships  managed to escape.    Nasution noted that the local police's equipment was almost  no match for the foreigners who got away.    Director general of fishery at the Agriculture Ministry  Mokhtar Abdullah said that marine exploitation in Malacca Strait  should not be allowed to threaten international relations as  many countries have their own interests at stake.    According to biological resources director Sukoco Adi  Sutrisno, speaking in a meeting recently, said that the Malacca  Strait is part of the Exclusive Economic Zone and a crowded  international sea lane.    It contains a fish resource of about 332,000 tons per year  including shrimps and coral fish.    "They are already being exploited by fishermen from Aceh,  North Sumatra, Riau and those who have license to operate from  the central government in Jakarta.    Meanwhile, reports from the eastern part of Indonesia said  that foreign poachers in the region are equipped with modern and  comprehensive facilities such as fish location detector.    Many of their trawlers fishing ships are like "floating  factories": catching fishes and directly manufacturing them in  the ship, so that when they anchor at a port they only have to  sell their goods.    Reports from Central Maluku said that some 16 foreign  fishermen were jailed in Halmahera last year for illegally  entering Indonesian waters.    Sulawesi, Irian Jaya and Nusa Tenggara waters are also among  the targets of foreign poachers.    The reports should therefore be sufficient enough evidence  that poaching by foreign fishermen in Indonesia exists and they  harm the interest of the country, particularly our own fishermen.</p>

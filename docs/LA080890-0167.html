			<p><P> August 8, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> RUNNERS CAN'T QUITE GET IT IN GEAR AT ITALIAN MEET; NO RECORDS FALL;  </P> <P> TRACK: BURRELL AND JOHNSON WIN RACES. THE ORGANIZERS HAD PROMISED A $200,000  FERRARI IF SOMEONE SET A NEW WORLD STANDARD.  </P> <P> American sprinters Leroy Burrell and Michael Johnson won their events today,  but failed in bids to set world records at a meet where records were made a  lucrative target.  </P> <P> The meet in this Alpine resort more than 6,500 feet above sea level offered a  $200,000 Ferrari Testarossa and money bonuses for a world record. If more than  one record was set, organizers said the car would be awarded for the record  deemed the most significant.  </P> <P> Burrell, who competed in Malmo, Sweden, Tuesday evening and arrived here  overnight, ran the 100 meters in 9.96 seconds, the best in the world this year  and just .04 off Carl Lewis' world record. Burrell beat fellow American Calvin  Smith by .08 seconds.  </P> <P> Johnson, who said he has the capability to improve on Pietro Mennea's 200-meter  record of 19.72, established in 1979, fell .16 short here, winning in 19.88  seconds, the second-fastest time at that distance this year.  </P> <P> Burrell said he ran well but did not have his best race.  </P> <P> "I am now focusing on the Zurich meeting. I should be in good shape by then,"  Burrell said.  </P> <P> The Zurich event, on Aug. 15, had been expected to feature a 100-meter duel  between Burrell and Carl Lewis. But Lewis, who pulled out of the Sestriere  meeting because of a strained left thigh sustained at the Goodwill Games, is a  doubtful starter at Zurich.  </P> <P> Johnson got off to a slow start but finished strong to clearly beat Brazilian  Robson Da Silva and American Floyd Heard.  </P> <P> Johnson said the slow start and a bad curve compromised his record chances.  </P> <P> "I had a bad curve that I usually do well. I was just a bit off of  concentration. I am not too pleased with my performance," said Johnson, a  23-year-old who set a personal best of 19.85 seconds in Birmingham, Ala., in  July.  </P> <P> The Sestriere meeting, labeled as the meet of records, was held at Europe's  highest track, with an altitude of 6,600 feet.  </P> <P> American Mike Powell, the top attraction in the long jump in the wake of Lewis'  absence, posted a winning leap of 27 feet, 7 1/2 inches.  </P> <P> Other American victories in the Italian meet were achieved by Danny Everett in  the 400 meters, Colin Jackson in the 110-meter hurdles and Kevin Young in the  400-meter hurdles.  </P> <P> Randy Barnes took the shot put with a toss of 72-4 1/2, more than three feet  off his recent world mark.  </P></p>

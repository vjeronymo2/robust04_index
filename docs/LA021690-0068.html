The suit, filed by the Temecula Band of Luiseno Mission  Indians in Riverside County Superior Court, charges that the Rancho California  Water District violated state environmental laws by approving the sewage  project without adequately assessing its impact. The district plans to blend  treated sewage with lake water and discharge 4.6 million gallons daily into the  ground water.  </P></p>

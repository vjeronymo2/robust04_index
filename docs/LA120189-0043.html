			<p><P> December 1, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PREVIEW: A LITTLE HEAVY METAL IN THE NAME OF AMNESTY  </P> <P> The Nymphs' Inger Lorre knows how to work a crowd. Take last Saturday night at  the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium. The sold-out arena was packed with a  punk-nostagic crowd waiting for the reunion appearance of the Buzzcocks, whose  last new album was released eight years ago.  </P> <P> On stage were the Nymphs, fronted by Lorre, who strutted and sashayed about the  stage with a microphone in one hand and a forest-green feather boa cuddled in  the other. Her voice cut easily through a layer of guitars and drums and crowd  noise that seemed to get louder and more impatient with each new song the  Nymphs played. When Lorre tore into the Nymphs' version of the Badfinger  classic, "Come and Get It," the tension in the audience was at its peak. They  wanted the Buzzcocks, not the Nymphs.  </P> <P> "Get off the stage," someone yelled. Others booed.  </P> <P> "Yeah, I know who you want," Lorre scowled back like some rock and roll Lenny  Bruce handling a roomful of hecklers. "I see your mohawks. Don't you know punk  was dead 10 years ago? Can't you think of anything more original?"  </P> <P> The crowd roared . . . and not necessarily with disapproval. Lorre epitomized  the punk attitude -- angry, tough, unrelenting -- that many in the audience  were so nostalgic for. And here it was being shoved in their faces by a band  that usually plays at . . . heavy metal shows.  </P> <P> "We're not going anywhere," she snarled. "We're getting paid for this."  </P> <P> Tonight, when the Nymphs take the stage at the Country Club in Reseda, they'll  be headlining . . . but they won't be paid. Neither will any of the opening  bands. It's a benefit concert for Amnesty International.  </P> <P> Proceeds from the show will be distributed to several Amnesty International  college chapters, which function much like regular Amnesty chapters. But  because college populations drastically change every semester, the campus  groups work only on short-term projects, such as the letter-writing campaign  earlier this summer to China after the massacre at Tian An Men Square.  </P> <P> "We're going to set up a table at the concert where people can send letters on  behalf of prisoners in South Africa," said Sung Kim, the organizer of tonight's  concert. She works for the Cypress College Amnesty chapter, which is sponsoring  the concert. This is the largest fundraising effort the junior college chapter  has attempted.  </P> <P> "It was hard at first, and a little scary," said Kim, a 20 year-old-business  major. "But I found that a lot of the bands and the managers were excited about  doing the show.  </P> <P>  The Nymphs, Jasmine Bomb, Clyde, If Tommorow and Sativa Luv Vox appear at  tonight's Amnesty International Benefit at The Country Club, 18415 Sherman Way,  Reseda. Doors open at 8 p.m. Tickets cost $13 and are available through  Ticketron. For information, call (818) 881-5601.  </P> <P> LAURIE OCHOA  </P></p>

			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Share prices close easier in uncertain trading - Market Report Share prices moved sharply in an erratic trading session in London yesterday, as equally uncertain trends in bonds kept investors confused over the near term outlook for domestic securities markets. The blue chip trading houses continued to wind down their positions ahead of the Easter weekend, and gilt-edged specialists were focusing on today's auction of Pounds 2.5bn short-dated bonds in London's first floating rate offering of government securities. The day's peak of 3,144.9 on the FT-SE 100 Index, 15.4 above the overnight level, came very early in the session. Once again buying interest was thin and shares turned off sharply when the government bond market began to fall away. An easier trend in sterling helped shares in the export leaders towards the close but this was counter-balanced by a fall of 33 points on the Dow Jones Industrial Average early in the New York trading session. The closing reading put the FT-SE 100 at 3,123.4 with a decline on the day of 6.1 points. Much of the movement in the Footsie stocks originated from the stock index futures sector. Lacking this distraction, the FT-SE Mid 250 Index gained 3.1 at 3,788.8, although trading in second-line issues was modest. Although oil prices steadied, shares in the major producer companies weakened on overnight selling in US markets. Pharmaceuticals drifted lower in nervous trading towards the close, when Wall Street was reacting sharply to data on consumer confidence and housing starts. Glaxo eased following confirmation that Losec, Astra's rival to Glaxo's highly successful Zantac drug, had been licensed for sale in the UK. Gyrations in the UK bond market, while not affecting share prices as directly as in some recent sessions, unsettled market confidence yesterday. There are constant rumours that at least one London based securities house has suffered heavy losses in gilts and that the erratic trend in the bond market reflects its attempts to restructure its trading position. Bonds are also perturbed by the interest rate pressures from outside the UK. The rest of the week, including Friday when most European markets are closed, will feature a flow of important economic statistics on the US economy, which will refocus investment attention on the likelihood of a further tightening in credit policy by the Federal Reserve. Both fund managers and market traders have already begun to concentrate on keeping positions tightly trimmed over the Easter holiday weekend. Seaq volume, at 673.9m shares, was higher than on Friday but at the low end of daily averages; Friday's Seaq volume was worth only Pounds 1.2bn in retail worth. Underlying confidence remains firm, however, with several leading investment banks continuing to urge clients that UK equities present a buying opportunity at present levels. BZW said that the stock market 'has now moved into overshoot'; in focusing almost exclusively on interest rate prospects, it has overlooked the 'positive indications for earnings recovery' appearing in the company results list. Last week's 'poor' retail price index has not changed the outlook for inflation, believes Mr Chris Dillow at Nomura Research. He suspects that the underlying rate will end this year at 3.2 per cent and next year at around 4.4 per cent.</p>

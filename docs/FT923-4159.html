			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / The TUC At Blackpool: Necessity forces consorting with the old enemy / A look at relations with the CBI MR Howard Davies today becomes the first head of the Confederation of British Industry, the employers' body, to address the TUC in its 124-year history. The move is part of an attempt by the TUC to build a new relationship with employers and to climb out of the ghetto of marginalisation it feels it has fallen into. Mr Roger Lyons, the new head of the MSF, the white-collar union, tells a story to illustrate this feeling of marginalisation. When the union recently opened an office in Dublin, he says, the guest of honour was the former Irish labour minister, Mr Bertie Ahern, who is now finance minister. A few weeks later, when the same union opened an office in Manchester, the guest of honour was not a government representative but a local footballer. The TUC hopes to signal by its invitation to Mr Davies that it is serious about the consensus part of the continental European idea of 'social partnership'. But with strikes at the lowest level for 101 years, and unions rarely able to challenge the will of management, many union officials argue that there is already an enforced consensus in British industry - on the employers' terms. 'The TUC is just casting around to find someone at national level to talk to,' said one general secretary dismissively. It is unlikely, however, that Mr Davies's predecessor Sir John Banham would have received the invitation. Union leaders believe they can do business with Mr Davies. But what business can the CBI and TUC usefully do together? Mr Norman Willis, TUC general secretary, finds it hard to be specific, but says: 'You could say the invitation was a symbol, but symbols matter.' Mr John Edmonds, leader of the GMB general union, is more precise. He believes that there are several issues - for example export credits and energy prices - where the two organisations have almost identical views and could together promote them more effectively to the government. 'If we can present a common argument on specific problems why not, eventually, a common package on infrastructure investment and stimulating the economy?' says Mr Edmonds. Although the CBI is unlikely to want to give the kiss of life to the TUC by agreeing to a stream of joint statements, one area where both sides agree that closer co-operation could be useful is training. Mr Davies is expected to devote a large part of his speech to the subject and will certainly mention the new national training targets which have been embraced by both the CBI and the TUC. However, there are still significant differences between the two sides, even on training, with the TUC keen to enforce better standards of training on employers by legislation, and the CBI preferring a voluntary approach. But members of both organisations have sat side-by-side on bodies such as the National Council for Vocational Qualifications and its committees which have devised National Vocational Qualifications, the new national system of assessment based on competence in the workplace. The CBI will shy away from any national-level pacts on training but the TUC is in any case planning to concentrate its efforts at local level. Mr Brendan Barber, head of organisation at the TUC, says: 'Unions have always been actively involved with training at national level, for example in the Manpower Services Commission. Where we have not done enough is with individual employers.' To make up for that the TUC is to publish a guide for union negotiators to help put training on the collective-bargaining agenda. Employers will be asked to agree to a plan promoted by the GMB and TGWU general unions to provide a minimum of five days annual training for all employees. At Imperial Chemical Industries the new joint union claim for manual workers includes the proposal for five days' annual training. At British Gas this year's agreement included a career support scheme to help employees with family responsibilities develop their skills. Wages for trainees at British Gas will also in future rise as they achieve various skill levels. However, training agreements are not always immune from traditional industrial relations problems. A two-year multi-skilling agreement at Swan Hunter Shipbuilding ran into trouble last week when electricians staged a 24-hour unofficial strike to protest at the provision of electrical work for boilermakers. But putting training on the collective-bargaining agenda also opens up some constructive possibilities. For example, some union leaders would be prepared to encourage their members to forgo part of a pay rise in exchange for a guarantee of quality training. That is the sort of consensus that the CBI might also find attractive.</p>

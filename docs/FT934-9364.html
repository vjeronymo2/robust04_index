			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Anti-corruption official sacked in Hong Kong A SENIOR official of Hong Kong's Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC), the anti-corruption watchdog, was yesterday dismissed without explanation. Mr Alex Tsui, the commission's deputy director of operations, was sacked with immediate effect following an internal probe, the ICAC said in a brief statement. It would not specify the nature of the inquiry but he has been under investigation for some months. The dismissal of Mr Tsui, the most senior ICAC official to be sacked since the founding of the commission in 1974, comes at a time of heightened concern in Hong Kong about the rise in corrupt practices, especially those involving business dealings, and mainland Chinese parties. Fear of increased corruption is the issue people in Hong Kong worry about most as they prepare for China's sovereignty in 1997. In the first nine months of this year complaints about business corruption in Hong Kong rose by 51 per cent to 1,341 complaints. Recently Mr Bertrand de Speville, the commissioner against corruption, said the ICAC was investigating 40 cases involving mainland Chinese companies or individuals. A recent ICAC survey had found that corrupt business practices may represent 3to 5 per cent of the cost of doing business in China. But respondents to the survey said this was bearable and did not amount to a disincentive to do business there. Late last month Mr de Speville held discussions in Guangdong and Beijing with senior government officials about cross border corruption and its prevention. He came away with an agreement from Guangdong's Provincial People's Procuratorate to increase liaison and co-operation.</p>

			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / Letter: Do what I say, not what I do Sir, Before the UK joined the European Economic Community, I sat next to a Swiss businessman on a flight from Bangkok to Tehran. I endured a long lecture from him on how Britain would benefit by joining the Community. When he paused for breath I asked him why, if the benefits were so great, Switzerland was not yet an enthusiastic member. He turned to me with a look of amazement and cried, 'We're Swiss. We would never be fools enough to put our fate in the hands of such a crazy gang.' Bristling with outraged indignation he turned his back on me. I still think he knew a thing or two.

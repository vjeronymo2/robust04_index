			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada, president of Cuba's  legislature, said today that the most important contribution of  Charles Rangel's bill calling for lifting the blockade against  Cuba is that it opens debate on the issue in the U.S. Congress.    Alarcon, an expert on Cuban-U.S. relations, said that the  beginning of congressional committee discussion of the blockade  from the point of view of those who wish to eliminate it is an  important step. In statements to the news agency PRENSA LATINA,  Alarcon said, with reference to the third Pastors for the Peace  caravan that is currently in Cuba, that the convoy is a very  important example of how solidarity with Cuba is growing, even  within the United States.</p>

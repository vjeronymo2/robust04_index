			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TIM WENGERD; PREMIER GRAHAM DANCER  </P> <P> Tim Wengerd, a devotee of Martha Graham, a leading interpreter of her works and  a dancer who spent much of the last five years choreographing performances  aimed at calling attention to the scourge of AIDS, has died of that illness at  his Albuquerque, N.M., home.  </P> <P> The New York Times reported in its Friday editions that he had died Sept. 12 at  age 44.  </P> <P> Called by celebrated dance critic Walter Terry the "most valuable and  versatile" dancer in the Graham company, Wengerd more recently had been  conducting workshops throughout the country, including several in San Diego,  where he had become the West Coast guru of the Graham movement.  </P> <P> "I guess I can't get away from Martha," he said half-seriously in one recent  interview, even as he was preparing a concert of his own solo works at San  Diego State University.  </P> <P> From 1973 until he left her company in 1982, Wengerd danced virtually every  leading male role in that repertory, enchanting audiences with his technique,  intensity and physical attractiveness.  </P> <P> In 1985, Los Angeles Times dance writer Eileen Sondak said Wengerd's own work  showed touches of Graham, "but it also reflects a quiet rebellion from the  brand of angst-filled psychodrama he learned from the acknowledged goddess of  modern dance."  </P> <P> The inspiration for Wengerd's own stark works -- some of which utilized bones  and sparse body coverings -- came from his roots in New Mexico, where he first  studied dance with Elizabeth Waters. He combined the elements of mountains and  deserts with African dress "to connect with the past."  </P> <P> The music for those movements came from taping "the sound of clacking rocks and  wind inside the (New Mexico) cave."  </P> <P> He coupled such avant-garde phenomena as "The Bone Cantata" with tranquil  interpretations of Brahms, balancing that with John Cage's "Four Sonatas for  Prepared Piano."  </P> <P> Wengerd came to national attention when he toured in the late 1960s with the  Repertory Dance Theater of Utah, a group he helped found in 1966, three years  before graduating from the University of Utah.  </P> <P> He was born in Massachusetts and raised in Albuquerque, where his father was a  geologist. After studying with Waters, he danced in Utah while attending  college and at the same time pursued an interest in choreography that had  surfaced in high school. In 1982, Wengerd went to Europe, where he taught and  performed his own works and became an assistant director of the Paris Opera  Ballet's modern dance troupe. He then went to Tanzania for the State Department  and returned to the United States to appear in solo concerts, rare in the  ballet world, and in Martha Clarke's "Garden of Earthly Delights."  </P> <P> Last fall he appeared in San Diego in his "Free Among the Dead," which he  called a response to the AIDS epidemic.  </P> <P> "People I've danced with have died from AIDS," he said in an interview in  connection with the four-concert series. "I'm more alive when I'm dancing than  any other time, and it's easy to translate my experience with AIDS into dance."  </P> <P> He observed at that time, however, that he didn't have the disease.  </P></p>

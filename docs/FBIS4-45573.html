			<p>CSO     [Excerpts] The bank of Thailand has announced strong  support for legislation to curb money laundering, saying a  money-laundering law will boost Thailand's image and raise the  standard of the Thai financial system.    Dr Bandid Nijthavorn, the central bank's deputy director of  the Research Department, said if Thailand wants to develop  further as a financial centre and win recognition from the  international community, it must introduce legislation, similar  to that in Hong Kong or Singapore, to make money laundering  unlawful.    Bandid's remark, made yesterday at the Journalists  Association of Thailand, was the first time that the central  bank came out unequivocally in support of a money-laundering law.    The drug scandal surrounding MP Thanong Siriprechapong, who  was forced to resign, dealt a blow to the Thai Parliament and  Thailand was seen as a haven for money laundering.    The Chuan administration has come under domestic and  international pressure to introduce money-laundering  legislation. But Bandid said the legislation should not only  seek to curb illegal drug activities but also cover other  criminal acts and political corruption. [passage omitted]    Bandid said that old laws seeking to curb money laundering  are not broad enough to cover economic crimes, so it is  necessary to introduce a brand new money-laundering law, which  should seek to:    1. Penalize all individuals associated with money-laundering  activities as a criminal offence;    2. Require financial institutions to report to the  authorities unusual transactions;    3. Lay down the same system for all financial institutions  to  file reports of suspicious transactions.    Bandid cautioned that the legislation should not create  unwarranted burdens on the financial institutions.</p>

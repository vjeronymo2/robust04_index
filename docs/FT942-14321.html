			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / MEPs ride through EU law Euro-MPs are preparing to exercise their newly-won powers of 'co-decision' under the Maastricht treaty by rejecting a proposed EU law banning powerful motor-cycles. MEPs have responded to public outcry and look certain to overturn a decision by EU governments limiting motor-cycle engines to 100 brake horse power. 'This started out as an issue about the power of bikes: it turned into an issue about the power of this Parliament,' said campaigning British conservative MEP Mr Peter Beazley yesterday.</p>

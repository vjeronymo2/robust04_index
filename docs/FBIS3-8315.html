The meeting was also  attended by Mate Granic, deputy prime minister and foreign  minister. They discussed the details of the Washington  agreement and the course of the Vienna negotiations conducted by  the transition committee for the preparation of a final  agreement between Croats and Bosnian Muslims on entering a  federation as two equal and constituent nations and on setting  up a confederal union with the Republic of Croatia.    It was said during the talks that the Vienna negotiations  are  expected to end by 15 March, when the final agreement should be  signed. President Tudjman stressed that the agreement is not  directed against the third side, but that the Bosnian Serbs are  invited to join the negotiations.    Lending his support to the Washington agreement, Abdic  stressed that he has always advocated close cooperation between  the Croat and Muslim nations, and that he opposed the elements  in the Muslim leadership which fomented Croat-Muslim clashes.  Abdic particularly stressed the importance of President  Tudjman's efforts to involve the Serb side in the negotiations  in order to restore peace.</p>

			<p><P> February 10, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> "The Prize Pulitzer," Roxanne Pulitzer's best seller about her messy divorce,  will be turned into an NBC movie that the network says will dramatize how she  "thought she'd been accepted into this fairy-tale world only to be rejected and  scorned when her marriage became a national scandal." During a highly  publicized 1982 divorce trial, witnesses testified about cocaine use, sexual  affairs and occult experimentation. Mrs. Pulitzer lost custody of their twin  sons to her husband, Peter.  </P></p>

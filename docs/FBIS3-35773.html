[Vigneron] Former Western advisers to the Russian Government  -- including Jeffrey Sachs -- have had very harsh words for the  conditions the IMF has forced upon Russia. Do you agree with  them?    [Fedorov] Their criticisms are excessive. True, the IMF's  approach was not always appropriate and its procedures lack  flexibility. However, the principle of enforcing conditions  must not be compromised: One must never give Russia money  without demanding guarantees with respect to economic  stabilization. In 1993, it was possible to meet the Fund's  requirements (budget deficit down to 5 percent of GDP and  inflation down to 5 percent monthly by year's end). These goals  were the reason behind everything I did as finance minister.    Unfortunately, 60 percent of my program could not be  implemented due to the government's lack of financial  discipline. Let me give you one single example: I proposed  last year to cancel some 50 decisions approving expenditures for  which no funding had been found. To no avail. In Russia, the  government decides on an expenditure first, and then it looks  for ways to fund it. How do you conduct a stabilization policy  in such conditions?    [Vigneron] How were your relations with Prime Minister  Chernomyrdin?    [Fedorov] In the West, people find it hard to understand  that a finance minister could disagree with the head of  government as to which policy is appropriate. We had frequent  rows. But frankly, I do not think Viktor Chernomyrdin is very  conversant with economic mechanisms. However, he is a born  politician. This is why he gave me his support every time I was  able to convince him that he would benefit politically from a  particular economic decision. Mark my word: To secure  financial assistance from the West, Viktor Chernomyrdin will  make all the promises asked of him with respect to budgetary and  monetary rigor. Then, of course, he will break them.    [Vigneron] What do you think the West can do now to support  the reform process in Russia?    [Fedorov] Western assistance must be channeled in two  directions. On the one hand, it must contribute to funding  private projects, as this creates jobs and stimulates related  activities. On the other hand, technical assistance to training  must be emphasized. Giving 10,000 people the training they need  in the new economic context is far more effective than having  10,000 Western experts churn out studies or reports.</p>

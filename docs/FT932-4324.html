			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / Lloyd's agent applies to hardship fund over losses MR TONY GOODA, who re-cruited Names to some of the highest loss-making syndicates at Lloyd's, has applied to the insurance market's hardship committee to help him avert possible bankruptcy. Mr Gooda's losses from syndicates 164, 290, 298 and 299, between 1988 and 1990, amount to just over Pounds 1m. It has also emerged that Gooda &amp; Partners, the 'members' agency' formerly chaired by Mr Gooda, is under investigation by Lloyd's regulators as part of a wider probe into the affairs of Gooda Walker's Lloyd's agency businesses. Mr Peter Middleton, chief executive of Lloyd's, wrote to a Gooda Name last week confirming that an inquiry was under way and that its terms of reference were 'as wide as they need to be to address all the issues that have been raised and that this embraces the activities of both the members' agency and the managing agency'. Seven insurance syndicates managed by Gooda Walker account for about one sixth of the more than Pounds 6bn in losses suffered by Lloyd's in the past five years. Lloyd's is expected to report record losses of up to Pounds 2.8bn for 1990 - its latest underwriting year - later this month. Speaking from his home in Coneyhurst, West Sussex, this week, Mr Gooda said he still had to supply additional information to the hardship committee and had received 'no offer as yet'. The committee reschedules the debts of those Names - the individuals whose assets support the insurance market - who are unable to pay their losses, allowing them to avert bankruptcy and retain a home and a modest income. More than 250 Names joined the market through Mr Gooda's agency. Many of them face losses of more than Pounds 500,000 each and are among the hardest hit in the insurance market. A number of Gooda &amp; Partners' Names allege they asked Mr Gooda not to be placed on high-risk syndicates when they joined the market. They also allege they were not advised to buy stop-loss insurance - a personal reinsurance policy - and that they were not kept informed about the deterioration in their results. When questioned about these concerns, Mr Gooda said it was the policy of Gooda &amp; Partners, now in liquidation, to channel smaller Names' investments into Gooda Walker syndicates, three of which were leaders in the catastrophe reinsurance market, where syndicates covered high-level losses of other syndicates and companies. He said he told Names he had no stop-loss insurance for himself, and had 'explained the principle of unlimited liability', although 'no promises were made for the future'.</p>

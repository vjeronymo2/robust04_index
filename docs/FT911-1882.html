			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Arts: The Cunning Little Vixen - Coliseum Newly refurbished for this revival (sponsored by British Fuels Group), Janacek's little opera comes up fresh as paint, and irresistible. Nothing has faded in David Pountney's production, nor in Maria Bjornson's witty, pretty designs - all the visual jokes re-play very well; and Nick Chelton's lighting has been beautifully recreated. I admit to preferring this Vixen to the Royal Opera's more hi-tech version, handsome though that is. It is not easy to imagine the new principals bettered. Lesley Garrett sings as if the role of the Vixen were what she'd always aimed at: bright, utterly confident and vital, appealing without a trace of cute whimsy. No vocal squeaks, either, in a part full of perilous leaps; she delivers it with flawless musical sympathy, and in the erotic passages - particularly candid with these furry lovers - she twangs one's heartstrings. Her Fox, Christine Botes, pleaded a sore throat on this first night, but that can only mean that she will be even better later. She managed an attractive sound anyway, shaped her phrases with the same authority as Miss Garrett, and deployed her Jack-the-lad persona with a disarming, toothy grin. No doubt both these remarkable debuts in the roles owe much to Sir Charles Mackerras, who knows the score as well as anyone in the world. Though he has been conducting it for years, this was his first time with it at the English National Opera. It sounded glorious: he had the violins dancing and sparkling even in that cruelly high register where Janacek likes to push them, and some kind of magic (partly electronic?) was worked with the great burst of hunting-horns. Mackerras began the third act with the proper stark menace; but everywhere else the music was steeped in affectionate warmth, quite memorably in the courting-and-mating of Act Two. If Norman Bailey is now slightly under-powered for the grand final peroration, his sage, grizzled Forester is a masterly operatic portrait. Indeed, though the character is no saint, Bailey gives him a kind of moral weight which serves as anchor for everything else that goes on. He is abetted with delightful skill by Terry Jenkins' woeful Schoolmaster and Mark Richardson's gloomy Parson. The numerous other roles are vividly taken, and a lot of excellent children do their foxcubs and other woodland creatures with neat charm, coyness-free - more praise to Pountney and his choreographer Stuart Hopps. For newcomers to the opera, there could be no happier introduction. A creditable amount of the English text is made distinct; adults can enjoy the piece as much with children, for whom it will all seem perfectly clear, as without. And long-standing fans of the Vixen will certainly discover many moments in the opera which have not seemed so apt and telling before; and above all, as I said, the central soprano pair are pure delight.</p>

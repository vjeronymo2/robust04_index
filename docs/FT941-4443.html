			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / Little change due on law for women Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, last night accepted that some changes should be made to the Sex Discrimination Act to improve employment opportunities for women. However he ruled out wholesale recasting of its provisions. While promising to have further discussions with the Equal Opportunities Commission, he told the Commons: 'I do not think we should substantially reshape the legislation.' Mr Hunt rejected Labour charges that over the last 15 years the government had exploited the increase in male unemployment by encouraging the use of part-time women workers to drive down wage levels. He said women often wanted to combine work with family commitments, and had benefited greatly from the creation of more than 2m part-time jobs over the past 10 years. Ms Clare Short, who speaks for Labour on women's issues, said the overwhelming majority of women were in low-paid jobs with little opportunity for promotion, and no pension entitlement. She said the expansion in the number of part-time women workers had followed the destruction of more and more full-time jobs for men, and had resulted in the 'dragging down of standards' for everyone. Ms Short added: 'Women do not want rotten wages, no training and no pensions  -that is why full-time rights for part-time workers are crucial'. She called for urgent action to implement the recent House of Lords' judgment that the UK's laws on part-time workers' rights over redundancy pay and unfair dismissal were in breach of European law. Ms Short said Labour's commitment to introduce a minimum wage would 'pay for itself' through the increase in the income tax yield and the savings in the social security budget resulting from reduced payments of family credit. Mr Hunt condemned discrimination against women as 'not only inefficient but clearly wrong' and maintained that there was great scope for a bi-partisan policy. He stressed that only 13 per cent of women with part-time jobs would prefer to work full time.</p>

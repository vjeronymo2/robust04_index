			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Business and the Environment: Demands from the suppliers A UK catering company received more than 40 different questionnaires on its environmental credentials from prospective clients. Other companies have had similar experiences as businesses begin to apply a green filter to their buying. 'Some of the questions were dubious in terms of their value to environment issues, such as queries about our turnover,' says Roger Brown of Sutcliffe Catering, a subsidiary of P&amp;O. 'I think it is essential to have a code of practice governing the sorts of questions that need to be asked.' Business in the Environment, the charity backed by industry and Prince Charles, is working with consultants KPMG to develop such a code. It will be backed by the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply. 'The idea is to produce voluntary guidelines which will help both customers and suppliers by introducing consistency into the way in which environmental performance is assessed,' says Martin Houldin of KPMG. B&amp;Q, the UK do-it-yourself chain, insists that all its suppliers comply with a comprehensive environmental checklist. It was the first big retailer in the UK to take the initiative and has worked with its suppliers to help them conform to its required standards. 'We now know far more about our products and we can talk with greater confidence because we have exposed our skeletons. It helps us manage the business that much better,' says Alan Knight, B&amp;Q's environment specialist. Large buyers, such as BT and IBM UK, also include environmental criteria in their specifications. These companies might be less susceptible than retailers to consumer pressure, but neither wants their image tainted by the environmental misdemeanours of suppliers. The effects of buyers' environmental demands have begun to percolate down the supply chain. 'For many small companies who are not directly affected by new laws, it is often the first time that they have had to think about the environment in business terms,' says Edwin Datschefski of the Environment Council, a charity that promotes good environmental practice in business.</p>

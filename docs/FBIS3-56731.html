The source maintains that differences between Boris Yeltsin  and Viktor Chernomyrdin on a number of candidacies for key  Cabinet posts presented to the prime minister have somewhat  delayed a decision on the Cabinet's personal composition.    The source offered the following rough forecast:  Chernomyrdin  as the prime minister, Oleg Soskovets as the first deputy prime  minister, Chubays, Fedorov, Yarov, Zaveryukha as deputy prime  ministers, Grachev, Yerin, and Kozyrev as ministers in charge of  decision-making ministries, and Gerashchenko, as chairman of the  Central Bank.</p>

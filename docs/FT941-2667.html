			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / School tests still in danger, say heads Secondary school heads yesterday stepped up pressure over the national curriculum with a statement that industrial action by only one teacher could be enough to halt all tests in a school. Mr John Patten, the education secretary, immediately attempted to persuade heads to take a stronger line against the action. He said at the Secondary Heads Association's annual conference in Bournemouth: 'Any industrial action in schools puts heads squarely in the crossfire. That is bound to be uncomfortable. But head teachers, as managers and chief executives of their schools, know that big issues are at risk.' Head teachers are in an awkward position because the UK's largest teaching union, the NUT, apparently intends to boycott all the tests. Mr Patten said such action was 'damaging and pointless' and added that both Sir Ron Dearing, the government's chief adviser on the tests, and Ofsted, the education watchdog, had found the tests valuable. The pressure on Mr Patten seemed to have lifted after the Association of Teachers and Lecturers and the NASUWT - - the two other teachers' unions that boycotted the tests last year, advised their members to abandon the boycott this year. But Mr John Sutton, general secretary of the Secondary Heads Association, which includes 80 per cent of secondary schools, made it clear that the NUT could still cause serious disruption. Mr Sutton told the conference: 'Our members will not ask teachers to undertake tasks which members of the NUT have refused to do. If you have a head of department who is boycotting, you've probably blocked all tests for that department.' He added that NUT members responsible for a school's over-all timetabling would be able to force abandonment of the tests altogether. Mr Patten made a strenuous attempt to shake heads away from this position, saying that both the law and the Dearing proposals were at stake. 'If, as head teachers, you believe in the consensus which Sir Ron has fashioned, I hope you'll stand up for that consensus and make it work,' he said. In another speech to Tories in Andover last night Mr Patten expressed deep concern at the decline in the teaching of British history in schools and called for it to take pride of place in schoolchildren's historical studies. 'We must not allow our children to be robbed of their birthright of knowledge about our country's history,' he said. Mr Eric Forth, schools minister, yesterday announced that 41 local education authorities would share a total of Pounds 5.517m to improve school buildings.</p>

			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / The Property Market: Costly journey overseas - The Swedes' disastrous record London &amp; Edinburgh Trust, a UK property company bought by Swedish insurer SPP three years ago, has won itself a place in the record books. Its Pounds 448.6m pre-tax loss for 1992 is one of the largest in the UK property industry. But the real significance of the loss is its likely impact on Swedish investors. It is another example of the disastrous property losses they have suffered at home and abroad. SPP's acquisition of LET was part of a wave of Swedish property investment across Europe after exchange controls were relaxed by the Swedish authorities in the late 1980s. The freedom to invest money outside Sweden triggered spending of SKr100bn (Pounds 8.84bn) on foreign property between late 1987 and the end of the decade - more than twice the figure invested in foreign shares over the same period. This surge of investment, which was prompted by a desire to diversify from the overheated domestic market, could hardly have occurred at a worse time. After some early successes in Belgium and the Netherlands, the Swedes invested in new markets, notably London, which were close to their peak and heading for a steep fall. To make matters worse, many companies were highly geared. Entrepreneurs often borrowed abroad on the strength of capital which had been raised by borrowing against their Swedish property. At the time, Swedish investors were considered to be paying excessively for property, perhaps because they used inflated domestic prices as their benchmark. They were also unusually adventurous. Instead of opting for investment properties in established locations, they preferred building their own developments. Consider, for instance, some of the more prominent Swedish-built buildings in London. Swedish investors are heavily represented in Docklands, London's worst-hit property market, with Skanska's 550,000 sq ft largely unlet Thomas More Square and East India Dock, a 600,000 sq ft, mostly unlet office scheme on the edge of the Docklands, which is jointly owned by NCC, a construction company, and SPP. Hammersmith, another fringe location in west London, was chosen as the site of the Ark, a strikingly unconventional building which - in spite of numerous architecture awards - is also unlet. It was built by Ake Larson Byggare, a Swedish contractor, which went into receivership earlier this year. The problems encountered by Swedish developers abroad demonstrate the difficulties of operating overseas. Swedish companies' undoubted construction and design skills did not stand them in sufficient stead in London, where tenants place greater emphasis on good location than on quality, certainly more so than their counterparts do in Sweden. 'They did not take enough account of local factors,' says Sir Julian Berney of Jones Lang Wootton, chartered surveyors. The losses endured by Swedish investors overseas have played a prominent part in the recriminations over how the Swedish financial sector got into its present problems. Allegations of fraud and negligence by lenders are also recurring themes in the debate about where responsibility should lie for Swedish property losses. The best explanation for the property predicament lies in the behaviour of the Swedish banking system following its deregulation in 1985. This triggered an explosion in credit, much of which was directed towards property; at the time property was a highly tax-efficient investment. The banks competed vigorously for property loans, lending up to 90 per cent of a property's value. 'The banks had a philosophy of growing by volume. The more you could lend the better,' says Mr Magnus Dager, a consultant for Knight Frank &amp; Rutley and a former president of the Swedish Property Federation. If the banks are blamed for inflating property prices, then the Swedish government is held responsible for pricking the bubble. 'For decades the politicians have said they would fight inflation. When they did, it took people unawares,' says Mr Sten Westerberg of Swedish financial advisers Westerberg &amp; Co. The government's assault on inflation more than doubled real interest rates to 10 per cent-plus in 1991-92. Rising interest rates together with the worsening recession sent property prices down as fast as they had risen. Since the mid-1990 prices have fallen by more than 50 per cent, putting at risk more than half of the SKr275bn in commercial property loans held by Swedish banks, says one broker. As the scale of these potential losses became evident, Sweden's centre-right government took on the politically unpopular task of bailing out the banking system at a time when it is trying to reduce a rising public sector deficit. The government has created a 'bank support authority' to administer state aid which has so far totalled SKr74bn in cash, loans and guarantees. Problematic loans will be put into so-called 'bad banks' - a newly-created holding company for the bad loans. These 'bad banks' will remain in state hands while the rump of the parent banks are sold off. The result is that the government is likely to retain responsibility for these assets for years to come. The legacy of the ill-starred investments of the late-1980s may dog the economy for a decade or more.</p>
